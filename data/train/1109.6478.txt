    "left - right ( lr ) symmetric extensions of the mssm ( `` minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model '' ) automatically contain the correct ingredients to explain the observed neutrino masses and mixings .",
    "the right - handed neutrino superfield , @xmath3 , is necessarily part of the theory and breaking the lr symmetry by @xmath4 triplets generates at the same time a majorana mass term for the @xmath3 and thus a seesaw mechanism @xcite , in contrast to type - i seesaw models where a majorana mass term is merely added by hand . in lr models",
    "new gauge and higgs fields appear with masses below the gut scale , which change the running of all parameters under rge evolution .",
    "in particular , the change in the running of the soft supersymmetry breaking masses can lead to potentially interesting effects in the phenomenology of susy models , even if the scale of lr breaking is above the energy range testable by accelerator experiments .",
    "quite a large number of different lr models have been discussed in the literature .",
    "the original ( non - supersymmetric ) lr models @xcite break the @xmath5 group by scalar doublets .",
    "later it was realized that breaking the lr symmetry by ( a pair of ) triplets with @xmath6 generates automatically also a seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "four triplets are needed @xcite in the supersymmetric version of this lr model : @xmath7 and @xmath8 due to the lr symmetry and @xmath9 and @xmath10 for anomaly cancellation .",
    "aulakh et al .",
    "@xcite extended this minimal lr model ( and thus also r - parity ) is broken by the vacuum expectations value of the @xmath11 , the non - susy models of @xcite do not introduce any bi - doublet , but only a pair of left- and right- doublets . in this construction fermion masses have to arise from non - renormalizable operators @xcite . ] introducing an additional pair of triplets @xmath12 and @xmath13 with zero lepton number .",
    "the advantages of this setup , in the following called the @xmath14lr model , are two - fold @xcite : first , the lr breaking minimum leaves r - parity unbroken already at tree level and , second , a non - trivial ckm matrix for quarks is generated easily and without resorting to flavour violating soft terms @xcite .",
    "both , the minimal susy lr model @xcite as well as the @xmath14lr model @xcite break the lr symmetry at an energy scale far above the range accessible to accelerator experiments",
    ". only indirect tests of these models are therefore possible , all of which require some assumptions about the high scale boundary conditions for the soft susy breaking terms . assuming cmssm ( `` constrained '' mssm ) @xcite boundary conditions , two kind of indirect signals",
    "are possible , in principle : ( i ) lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) decays and ( ii ) changes in the susy particle mass spectra .",
    "lfv decays are induced in supersymmetric models , even for strictly flavour blind boundary conditions , in the rge running of the soft parameters , as has been shown for the case of type - i seesaw already in @xcite .",
    "with lfv observed in neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , one expects lfv to occur also in the charged lepton sector in practically all susy models .",
    "however , there is a qualitative difference between seesaw models and lr models : whereas in susy seesaw lfv is expected to occur dominantly in the left slepton sector @xcite , an lr symmetry implies that left and right sleptons should have equal soft mass terms . even with lr symmetry then broken at low energies , lfv in the right slepton sector can be sizable , as was shown in @xcite .",
    "right slepton lfv could , in principle , be detected directly at accelerators or indirectly by measuring polarization in the decay @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "potentially measurable differences in susy mass spectra with respect to cmssm expectations can occur in seesaw type - ii @xcite and type - iii @xcite , as well as in the @xmath14lr model @xcite .",
    "changes with respect to cmssm can best be understood analytically by forming certain `` invariants '' , i.e. soft susy breaking mass parameter combinations which are to 1-loop leading - log order constants over large ranges in cmssm space @xcite .",
    "although there are quantitatively important 2-loop corrections to these invariants , as we will show below in the @xmath14lr model the invariants have _ qualitatively _ different behavior from all seesaw models , due to the lr symmetry .",
    "this is similar to the situation discussed recently in @xcite in the context of different @xmath16 based models .",
    "even slight changes in the susy spectra can lead to rather sizable changes in the calculated relic density of the lightest neutralino , @xmath17 , as has been shown for seesaw type - ii @xcite and type - iii @xcite and also for an so(10 ) based model @xcite .",
    "this fact can be easily understood taking into account that all solutions in cmssm parameter space @xcite , which survive the latest wmap constraints @xcite , require some special relations among susy masses in order to get a low enough @xmath17 .",
    "for example , in the stau co - annihilation region @xmath17 is essentially determined by @xmath18 , as long as @xmath19 gev or so .",
    "changing @xmath20 and/or @xmath21 by only a few gev will then change @xmath17 by a large factor .",
    "below we will discuss how the standard solutions to the dm problem are changed within the @xmath14lr , with respect to the `` pure '' cmssm allowed regions .",
    "since the @xmath14lr model has potentially large lfv in the right slepton sector , the dm constraint can also be fulfilled using the flavoured co - annihilation solution , recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "we provide and discuss a few examples where flavoured co - annihilation can be realized in the parameter space of the @xmath14lr model .",
    "finally , lfv susy decays might be seen at the lhc . in @xcite",
    "we have shown that branching ratios @xmath22 , with @xmath23 are potentially large within the @xmath14lr . here",
    "we extend this work by calculating the susy production cross section for @xmath24 from cascade decays , to estimate the number of events that could be found at the lhc .",
    "we have found @xmath25 up to @xmath26 @xmath27 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we define the basics of the @xmath14lr model . in section [ sec : gsl ] we discuss gauge coupling unification , generalities for the expected changes in the susy spectra with respect to cmssm expectations and certain aspects of lepton flavour violation . in section",
    "[ sec : dm ] we discuss dark matter in the @xmath14lr model , while section [ sec : lhc ] discusses lepton flavour violation phenomenology for the lhc .",
    "we then close with a short summary .",
    "in this section we present the model originally defined in @xcite , where a two step breaking of the lr symmetry was proposed in order to cure the potential problems related to the conservation of r - parity at low energies @xcite . for further details see @xcite .      below the gut scale for more details about gauge coupling unification and the gut scale . ]",
    "the gauge group of the model is @xmath28 .",
    "in addition , parity is assumed to be conserved .",
    "besides the quark and lepton superfields of the mssm with the addition of ( three ) right - handed neutrino(s ) @xmath3 , some additional superfields are required to break the lr symmetry down to the standard model gauge group .",
    "first , two generations of @xmath29 superfields , bidoublets under @xmath30 , are introduced .",
    "they contain the standard @xmath31 and @xmath32 mssm higgs doublets .",
    "note , that two copies are needed in order to generate a non - trivial ckm matrix at tree - level .",
    "furthermore , triplets under ( one of ) the @xmath33 gauge groups are added whose gauge quantum number are given in table  [ tab : particles - step1 ] .",
    "note that the model contains @xmath34 and @xmath35 triplets .",
    "note that the superpotential in eq .",
    "is invariant under the parity transformations @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "this discrete symmetry fixes , for example , the @xmath43 coupling to be @xmath44 , the complex conjugate of the @xmath45 coupling , thus reducing the number of free parameters of the model .",
