    "lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) interactions are worthwhile to study since they ensure comprehensive information about the possible new physics effects beyond the standard model ( sm ) and the free parameters existing in these models .",
    "such processes occur with the help of the tree level flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) , which appear in the models beyond the sm , like the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) .",
    "it is well known that the model iii version of the 2hdm possesses the fcnc at tree level and the strengths of the flavor changing ( fc ) interactions are regulated by the yukawa couplings , appearing as free parameters which should be restricted by the experimental data .",
    "the addition of extra dimensions into the theory brings new extension and the search of the effects of the possible new dimensions would be illustrative to test their existence .",
    "extra dimensions are introduced for solving the gauge hierarchy problem of the sm and there are various studies on this subject in the literature @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the idea is that there is a fundamental theory lying in higher dimensions and the ordinary four dimensional sm is its low energy effective theory .",
    "this is achieved by considering that the extra dimension ( two extra dimensions ) over four dimensions is compactified on orbifold @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) with small radius @xmath6 , which is a typical size of the extra dimension(s ) .",
    "this compactification results in the production of kaluza - klein ( kk ) states of the fields with masses regulated by the parameter @xmath6 .",
    "if the extra dimensions are accessible to all fields in the model , they are called as universal extra dimensions ( ued ) in the literature @xcite-@xcite . in this case , the extra dimensional momentum is conserved at each vertex and the interactions with only one kk state are forbidden , i.e. , the kk number is conserved .",
    "the conservation of the kk number leads to the appearance of heavy stable particles .",
    "furthermore , this conservation causes that the kk modes enter into the calculations as loop corrections and , therefore , the constraints on the size of the extra dimensions which are obtained from sm precision measurements are less stringent .",
    "the size of compactification scale has been studied by taking into account the loop effects induced by the internal top quark and it has been estimated in the range of @xmath7 , using the electroweak precision measurements @xcite , the @xmath8 -mixing @xcite,@xcite and the flavor changing process @xmath9 @xcite . in several works",
    "@xcite , this size has been estimated as large as few hundreds of gev . in the case of non - universal extra dimensions , where some of the particles are confined on 4d brane and",
    "do not feel the new dimensions , the coupling of two zero modes with the kk mode is permitted and this ensures to predict the effects of extra dimensions even at tree level .",
    "our work is devoted to the analysis of the lfv t - quark @xmath0 and higgs boson @xmath10 and @xmath11 decays in the framework of the model iii , with the addition of a single ( two ) extra dimension(s ) .",
    "we consider that the new higgs doublet and the gauge sector of the sm feel the extra dimensions , however , the other sm fields are confined on 4d brane .",
    "since these decays can exist at tree level in the model iii , the higher dimensional effects for non - universal case under consideration appear with the intermediate ( virtual ) neutral higgs fields @xmath12 , namely @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which can create `` two zero modes - kk mode '' vertices , in contrast to the case of ued . in the present analysis",
    ", we try to predict the additional effects due to a single and two spatial extra dimensions . in the case of a single extra dimension , the kk modes of the neutral higgs fields @xmath12 , with masses @xmath15 , appear after the compactification on orbifold @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath16 is the mass of @xmath17th level kk particle where @xmath6 is the compactification radius .",
    "if there exist two spatial extra dimensions which are accessible to the new higgs doublet , the non - zero kk modes of the neutral higgs fields @xmath12 have the masses @xmath18 , where the mass terms @xmath16 and @xmath19 are due to the compactification of the extra dimensions on orbifold @xmath5 @xcite .    in the numerical calculations we see that the extra dimension contribution to the fv @xmath20 decay is negligible , at least , up to two extra dimensions .",
    "however , the lfv @xmath21 and @xmath22 higgs decays are sensitive to the extra dimensions and the predictions of additional effects to their decay widths are almost comparable with the decay widths obtained without extra dimensions , in the case of two extra dimensions .",
    "this result may ensure a test to determine the compactification scale and the possible number of extra dimensions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present the decay widths of lfv interactions @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the model iii version of the 2hdm , with the inclusion of non - universal extra dimensions .",
    "section 3 is devoted to discussion and our conclusions .",
    "the fv interactions are worthwhile to investigate and , among them , the lfv interactions receive great interest since the theoretical predictions of their branching ratios ( br s ) in the framework of the sm are small and this forces one to go the new models beyond",
    ". the model iii version of the 2hdm , permitting tree level neutral currents , is one of the candidate that can ensure additional contributions to the physical quantities with the appropriate choice of free parameters , such as yukawa couplings , masses of new particles .",
    "the inclusion of spatial extra dimensions causes to enhance the br s of these decays and these enhancements depend on the compactification scale @xmath25 , where @xmath6 is the radius of the compactification .",
    "now , we assume that the second higgs doublet feels the extra dimensions .",
    "we start with the part of the lagrangian which is responsible for the fv vertex , the so called yukawa lagrangian , in a single extra dimension : @xmath26 where @xmath27 represents the extra dimension , @xmath28 and @xmath6 denote chiral projections @xmath29 , @xmath30 for @xmath31 , are two scalar doublets , @xmath32 are left handed quark doublets , @xmath33 are right handed up ( down ) quark singlets , @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) are lepton doublets ( singlets ) , with family indices @xmath36 .",
    "the yukawa couplings @xmath37 are dimensionful and rescaled to the ones , @xmath38 , in four dimensions as @xmath39 .    in the present work",
    ", we assume that the higgs doublet lying in the four dimensional brane has non - zero vacuum expectation value which ensures the ordinary masses of the gauge fields and the fermions . on the other hand , the second doublet , which is accessible to the extra dimension ,",
    "does not receive the vacuum expectation value .",
    "namely , we choose the doublets @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the their vacuum expectation values as @xmath42\\ , ; \\phi_{2}=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(\\begin{array}{c c } \\sqrt{2 } h^{+}\\\\ h_1+i h_2 \\end{array}\\right ) \\,\\ , , \\label{choice}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath43 with the choice under consideration the mixing between neutral scalar higgs bosons is switched off and it would be possible to separate the particle spectrum so that the sm particles are collected in the first doublet and the new particles in the second one . here",
    "@xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the well known mass eigenstate @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "notice that both higgs doublets can have non - zero vacuum expectation values in general and this leads to the mixing between the neutral higgs bosons @xmath46 and @xmath13 in the cp even sector . in the cp odd one",
    ", the mixing appears between @xmath47 and @xmath45 .",
    "there exist new parameters which include the mixing angle of cp even neutral higgs bosons and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of each higgs doublet , in the vertices ( for example @xmath48 and @xmath49 vertices , lepton - lepton higgs boson vertices ( see @xcite and @xcite for review ) .",
    "therefore , in general , the mixing angle and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values appear in the physical quantities .",
    "the part which produce fcnc at tree level @xmath50 carries the information about the extra dimension over the second higgs doublet @xmath41 and it can be expanded into its kk modes after the compactification of the extra dimension on orbifold @xmath4 as @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the four dimensional higgs doublet which contains the charged higgs boson @xmath53 , the neutral cp even ( odd ) @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) higgs bosons and @xmath6 is the compactification radius .",
    "furthermore , each non - zero kk mode of higgs doublet @xmath41 includes a charged higgs of mass @xmath54 , a neutral cp even higgs of mass @xmath55 , a neutral cp odd higgs of mass @xmath56 where @xmath16 is the mass of @xmath17th level kk particle , emerging from compactification .",
    "now , we start to investigate the lfv inclusive @xmath57 decay where @xmath58 are different lepton flavors ( see fig .",
    "1 ) in the model iii , where only the new higgs doublet feels a single extra dimension .",
    "this process can exist at tree level , by taking non - zero @xmath59 transition driven by the neutral bosons @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "there are fv vertex in the quark sector , @xmath60 and it is connected to the @xmath61 outgoing leptons . since only the new higgs doublet , and therefore , the @xmath13 and @xmath14 bosons , feels extra dimension , the kk modes of them contribute to the process in addition to their zero modes ( see fig .",
