    "it is well known that beyond the perturbative qcd there are other effects ( higher twist effects , nuclear corrections , target mass corrections etc . ) to be included into the joint qcd analysis of sf .    in the paper , we present the results of nnlo qcd analysis of the data on the @xmath0 structure function obtained by the ccfr collaboration with taking in account of the target mass , higher twist and nuclear corrections .",

    "it is expressed via the rdwf @xmath53 as follows    @xmath54    where @xmath55 is the polarization density matrix for an unpolarized deuteron .",
    "note that in the approach the use of the distribution function @xmath50 includes not only usual @xmath56- and @xmath57-wave components of the deuteron but also a @xmath58-wave component .",

    "the curve has an oscillatory feature and cross - over point @xmath64 .",
