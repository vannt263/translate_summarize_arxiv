    "( [ modeeq ] ) , ( [ chi1eq ] ) , ( [ chi2eq ] ) , ( [ chi - chifluc ] ) and ( [ chi1-chi2fluc ] ) , which we solve to obtain the baryon asymmetry , involves fluctuation terms with nonzero baryon number such as @xmath235 and @xmath146 . as such , the amount of baryon asymmetry that can be generated is limited by the hartree approximation implemented in these equations . on the other hand , as a result of the nature of the couplings under consideration , it is possible to create a large particle number density from the fluctuation term @xmath236 , which has nonzero particle number but zero baryon number under the global @xmath23 symmetry .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "4 , which shows that for a sufficiently large coupling the total particle number density deviates substantially from its classical value , while the baryon number density remains close to its classical value .",
    "a similar plot for a much weaker coupling , e.g. , @xmath219 , would show that both the particle number density and the baryon number density remain essentially at their respective classical values .",

    "let us recall the sample values of the model parameters cited after eq .",
    "( [ rad ] ) , which corresponds to the left end of the @xmath241 contour in fig .",
    "now let us entertain the possibility that the supersymmetry breaking scale may be as high as the grand unification scale , i.e. , @xmath242 .",
    "we then find @xmath243 and the baryon asymmetry is reduced by the nonequilibrium dynamics to the present observed value , @xmath244 , corresponding to the right end of the @xmath241 contour in fig .",
