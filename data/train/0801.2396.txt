    "various treatments @xcite have been proposed to describe these systems .",
    "for example , rate equations were used for certain two - step excitation schemes in @xcite . however , this approach is not applicable for the systems we primarily consider because spontaneous decay and related decoherence effects are negligible in our case .",

    "the pulse width of a gaussian pulse is @xmath226 ns and the interaction is characterized by @xmath213 , the same parameters used in @xcite and the simulation @xcite . the dependence for @xmath214 mhz",
    "can be compared with the numerically obtained dependence in @xcite for the lowest optical field amplitude .",
    "these two dependences are remarkably similar .",
    "this figure confirms that there is a region where the correlation function is greater than one only for a positive chirp ( the laser frequency linearly increases during excitation ) . in fig .",
    "[ corfun](b ) we show how the correlation function is affected by frequency detuning .",
    "this figure demonstrates that the correlation function is very sensitive to frequency detuning .",
    "although the detunings used in this figure are just a fraction of the laser bandwidth , the correlation function dependence varies significantly .",
    "positive detunings partially compensate the effect of attractive interactions so that certain separations between excited pairs are preferable for a given positive detuning .",
    "therefore , the correlation function is greater than one at such separations .",
    "this is not the case for negative detunings .",
    "these properties are also shown in numerical simulations @xcite . from these figures",
    "one may expect that relative small negative detunings can easily cancel out the effect of a possible positive chirp , which is easy to show using eq .",

    "it is worth noting that the relatively simple formula ( [ cor_fun_final ] ) reproduces well the main results of demanding numerical calculations .",
    "even though our formula for excitation probabilities ( [ p_0new ] ) and the correlation function ( [ cor_fun_final ] ) are primarily derived for lower laser power , they describe related physical phenomena reasonably well despite their simplicity .",
    "coupled with the fact that numerical many - body calculations are very demanding , these relatively simple formulae can be useful for actual experiments .",
    "we have investigated the many - body excitation dynamics in ultracold rydberg systems using the @xmath0-expansion .",
    "we have shown that the equations of motion can be solved by expanding the @xmath11-operators in powers of @xmath0 .",
    "different terms in the power expansions of the @xmath11-operators can be calculated using the recurrence relations .",
    "these recurrence relations are used to evaluate the expansion of the excitation probability up to the @xmath1 term . for homogeneous large samples ,",
    "the expansions obtained are additionally ensemble averaged in various cases of excitation pulses and interactions .",
    "we have also derived an explicit form of the correlation function between excited atoms for laser power and compared it with the recent numerical calculations .",
    "our derived formulae agree well with recent numerical many - body simulation @xcite .",
