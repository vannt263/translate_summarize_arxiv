    "numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been performed in the last decades to provide an understanding of the properties of magnetic nanoparticles , such as super - paramagnetism or surface - enhanced anisotropy@xcite@xcite .",
    "it has been proven possible to create nanoparticles built with alternating layers of various materials exhibiting different magnetic behaviors , which will influence the magnetic moment structure at the surface or interface @xcite .",
    "an induced magnetic anisotropy ( exchange bias ) can appear in such systems , corresponding to a shifted hysteresis loop and a ferrimagnetic alignment of the moments near the center of the nanoparticle as well as a pinning of the magnetic moments on the surface .",
    "it has been demonstrated that surface modification by organic ligands have a strong influence on the magnetic structure of the nanoparticles ( as described in the pioneering work of@xcite ) and also cause spin pinning near the surface@xcite .",
    "surface effects alone can change the magnetic structure , as it was demonstrated for instance in the case of cobalt @xcite , cobalt oxide @xcite , magnetite powders @xcite , and maghemite nanoparticles @xcite .",
    "those effects have been reviewed in the case of iron oxide in@xcite .    from the theoretical point of view , those effects and the related phenomena have been considered mainly from the phenomenological side . typically , monte - carlo calculations on the classical heisenberg model were performed@xcite , and results were compared to experimental data obtained on co - functionalized nipt clusters , as well as to dft calculations where magnetic moments were computed in the collinear local density functional approach .",
    "the monte - carlo - metropolis approach was also used in the case of magnetite nanoparticles in@xcite . in this work",
    ", the authors have demonstrated that the surface anisotropy constant can heavily influence the exchange - bias behavior . but",
    "this value remains a parameter and can not even be precisely inferred from experimental data ; only a range of possible values is estimated from the resulting magnetic behavior and the comparison to experiment .",
    "the problem of the _ ab initio _ computing of the magnetic anisotropy at the surface of a nanoparticle will be the focus of this paper . in literature , this parameter is a phenomenological input in large scale classical calculations based on modified heisenberg models . in the present work , on the example of a small cluster , namely fe@xmath2o@xmath3 we linked various magnetically constrained calculations to a heisenberg model in order to estimate magnetic properties of the nanoparticle from first principles .",
    "we studied the change in magnetic properties due the presence of a ligand ( dopamine ) or of a nearby gold cluster .",
    "we also considered a magnetite surface , with an eventual cobalt oxide layer .",
    "we discussed the resulting pertinence of the description by a heisenberg hamiltonian .",
    "we then adjusted the same hamiltonian on an ensemble of results obtained on mixed cobalt oxide and iron oxide clusters .",
    "the first objective was to obtain an optimized structure of fe@xmath2o@xmath4 , which according to mass spectrometry shows a higher abundance than other iron oxide clusters with different compositions @xcite .",
    "we chose this system because it is small enough to be easily modelled by repetitive first - principle calculations and yet provide interesting surface effects , and was already structurally studied@xcite .",
    "we used an _ ab initio _ ultrasoft pseudopotential scheme with a plane - wave basis as implemented in the quantum espresso ( qe ) suite ( @xcite ) .",
    "the plane wave basis set was defined by an energy cutoff of 30 ry ( 408 ev ) , confirmed to be sufficient by the test of convergence of the total energy .",
    "a mixing factor of 0.17 was employed on the densities in between each self - consistent field iteration .",
    "integration in the first brillouin zone was performed using 1x1x1 points sampling , since the system is an isolated cluster in a large computational cubic box of the size of 30 .",
    "the gga density functional from pbe@xcite was used with the corresponding pseudopotentials computed by a.dal corso with the `` rrkj3 '' code@xcite and taken from the quantum espresso pseudopotential data base .",
    "the optimization procedure was conducted without any symmetry .",
    "the structural results are close to the one previously reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "o@xmath4 cluster with six dopamine molecules . ]     on each axis .",
    "]            we also considered two cases of infinite surfaces : first , a 001 oriented slab of magnetite with atomic positions taken from  @xcite .",
    "this system provides an interesting approach to magnetic nanoparticles of medical interest . the small surface to volume ratio of those nanoparticles of a diameter close to 10 nm makes possible the study of the grafting of ligands by considering a locally flat surface in order to reduce computational cost  @xcite .",
    "another interest of such surfaces lies in their catalytic properties .    in a second step , we coated this surface in a close to epitaxial condition with 5 crystallographic units of a 012 surface of cobalt oxide , using periodic boundary conditions , and a vacuum of 12 atomic units on top , generated thanks to the ase package  @xcite , with the same computational conditions as previously described for the isolated cluster .",
    "the atomic positions , represented on figure  [ magneco ] , changed by less than 2 % in comparison to the input values after optimization , and the cell parameters changed by less than 1 % .",
    "a potential application of such a system might be found in the pinning of magnetic moments , and hence a change in hysteresis curves , from the coupling to antiferromagnetic materials  @xcite    from discussions with experimental teams  @xcite developing ferrites made of hybrid oxide nanoparticles we then tried a combined approach , generating a simple molecular dynamics simulation of a maghemite cluster coated with cobalt oxide , at 1000k , based on simple , buckhingam - like ionic potentials  @xcite and extracting several representative clusters of increasing size around a random atom .",
    "the atomic positions in these clusters were then optimized using the bfgs procedure within the quantum espresso suite with the same conditions discussed above , using periodic boundary conditions with a cubic cell of 32 atomic units . with",
    "the largest clusters discussed the systems are close to the bulk , the smaller ones being close to isolated systems .",
    "we think that these clusters , even though the crystallography or the stoechiometry deviate from pure allotropic forms , reflect what can be found in a typical molecular dynamics run .",
    "one should note however that before optimization of the atomic positions , the magnetic moments around each iron or cobalt atom were found close to zero .",
    "a typical cluster is given on figure  [ cluster ] .",
    "the change in local magnetic moments was computed using the quantum espresso ( pwscf ) code .",
    "we would like to note that such magnetic moments are sometimes referred to in the literature as `` spins '' , when they are actually expectations on the values of spin components integrated over a sphere of reasonable but arbitrary radius centered on each atom .",
    "for the purpose of this calculations , we used non - collinear density functional theory@xcite .",
    "we first considered four cases , fe@xmath2o@xmath4 alone , with one dopamine molecule added , with six dopamine molecules ( fig .",
    "[ 6dopa ] ) , and with a structurally optimized 20 atoms gold cluster in the framework of non - collinear magnetism calculations .",
    "we then considered a magnetite surface coated or not by cobalt oxide , and finally , a series of hybrid iron oxide / cobalt oxide clusters trending towards the bulk thanks to periodic boundaries conditions . in the case of magnetic computations we found that a reduction of the cutoff energy by half ensured consistency of the results ( a convergence test showed that a cutoff energy of 30 ry is a sufficient value to compute structural properties ) , and a 0.17 mixing factor of densities for self - consistency was employed . a smearing factor of 0.02 ry was used .",
    "we performed calculations assuming the systems to be isolated ( in the case of the cluster ) with a martyna - tuckerman correction @xcite .",
    "we checked the results by performing calculations with relativistic pseudopotentials and spin - orbit coupling which we generated from the values suggested in the qe distribution for cutoff ( 1.4 and 1.6 a.u for oxygen with 6 active electrons and a projector on empty 3_d _ states ) , and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials without spin - orbit as described previously .",
    "it is to be noted that the ab initio package we used ( qe ) does not compute orbital moments .",
    "we enforced a set of arbitrary magnetization states by imposing total moments different from the ground - state result but close to it within 2 @xmath6 in each direction , and extracted the corresponding magnetic field from the converged values , using the constrained magnetic calculation option from the latest version of the quantum espresso code , which gives the magnetic field as a function of the distribution of magnetic moments .",
    "we used a penalty factor of 0.001 for this purpose in order to speed up convergence under this external constraint . when the magnetic moments from the ground state result are used as a constraint , the magnetic field found is equal to zero .    in the case of the isolated clusters",
    ", we found a magnetic structure rather hard to describe in simple terms . in the case of the magnetite surface",
    ", we found , as known from the literature , a slightly ferrimagnetic state with a resulting magnetization of zero along the @xmath7 and @xmath8 axes and of 0.17 @xmath9 in the @xmath10 direction , orthogonal to the surface , with an absolute magnetization of 2.48 @xmath9 . in the case of the magnetite surface coated by cobalt oxide , we found an enhancement of total magnetization , to 9.89 @xmath11 in the @xmath10 direction , as expected experimentally . in the case of mixed iron oxide / cobalt oxide clusters ,",
    "the magnetic structure is hard to describe , depending on the chosen configuration and on the stoiechometry .",
    "we kept for the calculations structures where the average magnetization was above 0.75 @xmath11 per magnetic atom , the cobalt atoms inducing a reduction of total magnetization .",
    "the previous procedure gives a distribution of local magnetic moments ( @xmath12 ) , magnetic fields ( @xmath13 ) , and total energies ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we collected these values from various qe runs under different constraints , varying the total magnetization in either direction by a few @xmath9 , and fitted the parameters from the heisenberg hamiltonian@xcite , given as :    @xmath15    it is to be noted here that the zeeman energy ( last term ) is absent from total energy qe results ; the magnetic field is output separately .",
    "the first sum involves nearest neighbors interactions between iron atoms . in reference@xcite",
    "these were computed as from coordination numbers . in the bulk",
    "three different coordination numbers appear : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "these numbers apply for the core of the nanoparticle . in our case",
    ", these numbers were computed from the coordinates of the iron atoms , enforcing a cutoff radius of 3.2 such that no atom had more than 12 neighbors .",
    "this is to be compared to experimental results obtained on cobalt ferrites for instance  @xcite where similar values are found ( at room temperature compared to the present , zero temperature study ) , with a maximum interatomic distance of 3.56 to ensure a coordination of 12 .",
    "the second term in the hamiltonian is the core cubic magneto- crystalline anisotropy and reference@xcite chose a value of @xmath19 mev / spin    the third term accounts for the single - ion site surface anisotropy where the unitary vector reads    @xmath20    with @xmath21 the position vector of each iron atom on the surface and the sum runs over iron neighbors of @xmath22 .    in reference@xcite",
    "the exchange parameters were set at a value of @xmath23 mev , @xmath24 mev , and @xmath25 mev corresponding to a mix of ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic interactions .",
    "those values were taken from@xcite where they were fitted on @xmath0 @xmath1 results using a method similar in principle to the one we presently discussed : bulk spin waves were fitted to non - collinear spin calculations .",
    "the results of the @xmath0 @xmath1 calculations ( energies ) were fitted using the monte - carlo metropolis result method , based on random configurations of the parameters .",
    "we used a basic , proven quasi - random recurrence generator @xcite and a metropolis algorithm where we accept configuration changes ( in our case , a change of the heisenberg parameters ) @xmath26 corresponding to a @xmath27 change in the virtual energy of the system .",
    "the virtual energy @xmath28 is here a penalty function representing the distance in between the set of energies found with @xmath0 @xmath1 calculations and these found with the heisenberg model applied to the distribution of moments .",
    "the change is accepted if a random number @xmath8 uniformly drawn in between 0 and 1 is lower than @xmath29 .    to fit the @xmath0 @xmath1 results using the metropolis simulated annealing method we choose the following parameters : a reference energy @xmath30 ( fit parameter ) , the set of @xmath31 ( enforcing @xmath32 ) , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "we first used a small set of @xmath31 corresponding to a small cutoff in neighborhood search , then increased the number of neighbors to increase the quality of the fit . in order for the results to keep a physical meaning we kept the total number of fitted parameters ( maximum of 40 ) well under the number @xmath36 of samples used to define the virtual energy or penalty function from the energies in rydbergs :    @xmath37 .    in the case of the isolated cluster , since the set of @xmath31 is not too large , we allowed those to take any value , but in the case of the surfaces , the large number of @xmath31 gave an excellent fit anytime , whatever the conditions , and the distribution of values obtained was hard to read",
    ". therefore , in this latter case , we used the same model already used in  @xcite , namely two parameters for each kind of super - exchange(iron - iron , iron - cobalt or cobalt - cobalt ) related to the super - exchange angle @xmath38 in between atoms separated by an oxygen atom , using the relation @xmath39 which can be written in the form @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the coupling constant corresponding to the super - exchange angle of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "those two parameters per couple of atoms ( therefore six in total ) are the only ones fitted in the model with the volume and surface anisotropies .    in the case of the isolated cluster we also modified the heisenberg hamiltonian in the model to allow for a local change in surface anisotropy ending up with :    @xmath45    we also had to chose several parameters of the simulated annealing procedure such as the fictitious temperature , the annealing law , and the dependence of random changes to the temperature .",
    "all the software used is archived on    .... http://perso.univ-lemans.fr/~fcalvay/surf_anis_code ....",
    "we generated sets of @xmath46 configurations randomly drawn from _",
    "ab initio _ results corresponding to a total enforced magnetization running from @xmath47 to @xmath48 @xmath9 along the @xmath7 axis , @xmath49 to @xmath48 along the @xmath8 axis , and @xmath50 to @xmath51 @xmath9 along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "the best result ( penalty function as defined above less than @xmath52ry ) was , as could be expected from the increased number of degrees of freedom in the model , found using the largest number of fitting parameters ( full set of @xmath31 and set of surface anisotropy constants @xmath53 ) .",
    "a typical fit of _ ab initio _ values versus heisenberg model is given on fig .",
    "[ fe13o8 ] ; in this case it can be seen that the heisenberg model seems to model correctly the @xmath0 @xmath1 results .",
    "a further confirmation is found in the fact that the @xmath35 factor is obtained with a value lower than @xmath54 confirming that the absence of zeeman energy in the qe code results is found by the fitting procedure .",
    "a histogram of the obtained parameters for the @xmath31 is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ histo ] . it can be seen that those values are close to the ones of reference@xcite , with an alternation of ferromagnetic and anti - ferromagnetic couplings .",
    "the volume anisotropy was found to have a value of @xmath55 a.u , coherent with the one used in@xcite .",
    "the values for the local surface anisotropy constants are given in table  [ surfanis ] .",
    "it can be seen that the best fit corresponds to an alternation of positive and negative values for those constants .",
    "this fact raises the question of the validity of the hamiltonian used in@xcite in which a constant surface anisotropy was used .",
    ".local surface anisotropy constants [ surfanis ] [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         as can be seen on figure  [ configurationsfit ] the fitting procedure of the hamiltonian converged to a satisfying level , with a correlation coefficient close to 1 in between ab initio values of the magnetic energy and energies given by the model .",
    "we then added , after the fitting procedure several configurations chosen at random , in order to check the predictive capabilities of the model ( points labeled with an impulse ) , which can be seen as satisfying , despite obviously less good than the ones given by the model when reusing the input configurations used for fitting as in the previous case .",
    "the model can nevertheless be seen as adequate , since it uses only 12 fit parameters for 30 couples of input values , and has some predictive power .    from the physical results",
    "one can see that the values of the exchange constants kept the same order of magnitude as in the previous case of pure surfaces , although the values changed , with an interesting information for fe / co pairs .",
    "the same goes for the surface and volume anisotropies , with an enhancement in the case of iron oxide in comparison to cobalt oxide , the mixed situations being intermediate .",
    "the negative sign found in the case of cobalt oxide reflects the different magnetic order in the material , and the values at the interface reflecting the particular magnetic properties of the interface , as has been studied experimentally in the case of flat surfaces  @xcite .",
    "one should note than in the total energies , the main contribution comes from the surface term , followed respectively by the volume and exchange contributions .",
    "it is then no wonder that the latter term is particularly difficult to adjust .",
    "nevertheless , we can now display values of the surface anisotropy of iron oxide , and the changes induced by the presence of cobalt oxide .",
    "a problem remaining to be solved is that for the time being , we do not have at our disposal a clear physical way to predict the magnetic moments emerging from a given configuration of atoms .",
    "a machine learning approach based on physically relevant data such as relative angles and distances can be envisaged ; nevertheless the present study gives surface anisotropy values from an adjustment over ab initio results , and if values of magnetic moments are set to physically reasonable values as found in the bulk , can give a phenomenological description of magnetic nanoparticles of large size if the geometric configurations of atoms do not diverge too much from the bulk .",
    "in this work , we adjusted a classical heisenberg model of magnetism using the metropolis simulated annealing method including surface anisotropy effects on magnetically constrained , non collinear @xmath0 @xmath1 results obtained a small iron oxide cluster functionalized or not by one or several dopamine molecules or a nearby gold cluster .",
    "we conclude that the heisenberg model seems to apply well to the simpler systems ( namely , a free iron oxide cluster or a magnetite surface ) , allowing us to give some absolute values of the surface anisotropy constant , although a locally varying surface anisotropy alternating positive and negative values seem to provide a better description .",
    "this could allow us to describe the magnetic behavior of a nanoparticle of size 1 to 10 nm , which @xmath0 @xmath1 calculations can hardly tackle for the time being because of computing power limitations , hoping that the large surface proportion of iron atoms in the small cluster we have studied does not influence the results .    in the case of functionalized cluster by one or several molecules of dopamine , or by a nearby gold cluster",
    ", the heisenberg picture does not apply as well as for the simpler system , but we could nevertheless observe that the linear relation in between magnetic field and magnetization was unchanged in all those cases even if absolute values changed .    in the case of clusters of varying sizes and compositions , with periodic boundaries conditions , we were able to give a model describing hybrid ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems , describing functionally the enhancement in surface anisotropy due to the juxtaposition and mixing of the systems and giving estimations of the corresponding values .",
