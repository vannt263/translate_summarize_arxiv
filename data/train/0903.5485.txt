    "consider two infinite parallel plates separated by a gap @xmath0 , and assume that the field between the plates , as well as on the outside , is a scalar field obeying dirichlet boundary conditions at @xmath4 and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the direction normal to the plates ) . in order to get a casimir configuration we have to take into account the field outside the plates also .",

    "we are led to a casimir piston model in which spacetime is _",

    "one reason for the current interest is obviously the mathematical elegance of the formalism ; the efficiency of regularization procedures like the zeta function regularization is quite striking .",
    "typical for this kind of theories is that the field energy can be expressed in terms of epstein - like zeta functions .",
    "the casimir force between the two plates in physical space follows by taking the derivative of the energy ( or free energy at finite temperature ) with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "another motivation is of a more physical nature , namely to investigate constraints for non - newtonian gravity from the casimir effect ( cf .",

    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "present casimir force experiments are so accurate that the possible influence from extra dimensions is taken seriously .",
    "the hypothetical extra force is usually taken to be of the yukawa form .    in the present paper we will however not consider possible casimir - induced deviations from newtonian mechanics , but",
    "focus instead on the analysis of casimir free energy and force in the presence of extra compactified dimensions at _ finite _ temperature @xmath9 . at the final stages of our work , we actually became aware of a series of papers of teo , which go along similar lines as our considerations do .",
    "there is necessarily some overlap between teo s papers and the present one .",
    "however , since our results were for the most part obtained independently of each other , it may be of interest to make a more close comparison :    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the finite temperature casimir force in the presence of extra dimensions was calculated for the scalar field with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "the free energy was not considered .",
    "the force was always found to be attractive .",
    "when the ratio @xmath10 ( in our notation ) increased from 0.1 to 1 the casimir force was found to increase quite much , by a factor of about 3 . in our approach",
    ", the casimir force is calculated via the free energy .",
    "a satisfactory feature is that a detailed comparison ( some calculation is needed ) shows our results to be in agreement with each other .",
    "a more extended version of this work was given in the next paper @xcite , considering also the free energy . in the third paper in the series @xcite ,",
    "the free energy was studied for a massive scalar field with general curvature coupling subject to dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , thus a more general setting than that considered in our present investigation .    finally , in three recent papers teo investigated the finite temperature effect for a scalar field in multidimensional space assuming _ robin _ boundary conditions @xcite ; then gave a comparison between kaluza - klein and randall - sundrum models with special emphasis on the non - reversal of sign in the presence of warped extra dimensions @xcite , and worked out the casimir theory for a multi - layer dielectric slab model in piston geometry @xcite .    in the present paper we focus on the following two issues :    \\1 ) we allow there to be a refractive index , called @xmath2 , experienced by the scalar field in the physical medium between the plates .",
    "this influences the casimir free energy as well as the entropy , and is of interest in connection with the nernst theorem as @xmath11 . to our knowledge , such",
    "a generalization has not been considered before .",
    "the introduction of a refractive index is not so trivial as one might imagine , if one compares with electrodynamic theory : in that case , the casimir free energy expression @xmath12 gets an extra factor @xmath2 in the denominator at @xmath13 , the finite @xmath9 corrections being more complicated . here",
    "the @xmath13 behavior can be understood in a physical way by observing that the momentum of a photon in the medium can be written in the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the photon momentum parallel to the plates whose separation is @xmath0 , and @xmath16 is an integer ( in turn , this is intimately linked to the assumption that the photon momentum is as given by the minkowski energy - momentum tensor ) . taking into account the volume element in phase space , one obtains the essential result for @xmath12 .",

    "@xcite , and also the remarks of ravndal @xcite .",
    "\\2 ) our second point is to take into account the frequency dispersion of the medium in a crude way , by including the refractive index for low frequencies only .",
    "specifically , we cut off the influence from the medium , thus setting @xmath17 , for all frequencies exceeding the first matsubara frequency @xmath18 . from a basic viewpoint",
    "this procedure is permitted , since there is no conflict with the fact that the refractive index - like any other generalized susceptibility - has to be such that it decreases monotonically along the positive imaginary frequency axis .",
    "moreover , in physical units @xmath19 is lying in the region @xmath20 and is thus quite high , making the model sensible physically .",
    "this generalization is made for the case @xmath3 only .",
    "we begin in the next section by considering the general case where the number @xmath7 of edges in physical space is allowed to take the values 1 , 2 , or 3 .",
    "thereafter we specialize to the case @xmath21 , corresponding to the conventional setup with two parallel plates separated by a gap @xmath0 .",
    "zeta function regularization is employed .",
    "our main focus will be on low temperatures as mentioned , as this is of main physical interest .",
    "for @xmath2 constant we evaluate the casimir free energy , the corresponding pressure , the entropy , and work out some simplifying limiting expressions .",
    "the dispersion generalization is considered in section 6 .",
    "finally we mention for completeness that all plates , in physical space as well as in the extra compactified space , are so large that edge effects are negligible .",
    "we use natural units , with @xmath22 .",
    "we assume finite temperatures from the outset .",

    "this index describes the response from the homogeneous and isotropic medium to the scalar field , in the same way as the usual refractive index @xmath37 does in a dielectric medium , @xmath38 being the permittivity and @xmath39 the permeability . our model is thus a sort of scalar electrodynamics which has been considered occasionally in earlier studies also , for instance in ref .",
