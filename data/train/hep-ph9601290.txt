    "it is known since early 60 s that some high  energy processes can have a @xmath0-channel singularity in the physical region @xcite .",
    "this situation can occur if initial particles in a given reaction are unstable and the masses of the final particles are such that the real decay of the initial particles can take place .",
    "recently in the paper @xcite it was stressed that this problem turned out to be a practical issue for the reaction @xmath6 .",
    "it is noted in @xcite that the standard calculation of this cross section leads to the infinite result .",
    "indeed , if the invariant mass of the final @xmath7 system is smaller than the muon mass @xmath8 , the square of the momentum transfer in the @xmath0-channel @xmath9 can be both positive and negative depending on the scattering angles . in the region of small @xmath9 defined by the inequalities @xmath10 and @xmath11 the main contribution to the discussed cross section",
    "is given by the diagram with the exchange of the muonic neutrino in the @xmath0-channel ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-channel propagator brings the factor @xmath12 to the matrix element @xmath13 of this process    @xmath14    which results in the power  like singularity in the standard cross section @xmath15 it is , therefore , necessary to find physically reliable method to produce definite prediction for the measurable number of events .    in the paper @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) it was suggested to regularize this divergence by taking into account the instability of muons in the initial state . if this is the case , then the muon mass is the complex quantity with the imaginary part proportional to the muon width @xmath16 .",
    "it is possible then to solve the energy ",
    "momentum conservation constraints with the conclusion that the square of the momentum transfer in the @xmath0-channel acquires imaginary part proportional to the muon width .",
    "this observation leads to the replacement @xmath17 the divergent integral in ( [ 2 ] ) is therefore regularized @xmath18 consequently direct calculation of the scattering cross section becomes possible .",
    "we note in this respect that if such a regularization is performed , it is possible to estimate the typical time necessary for this reaction to occur .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this time is of the order of the moving muon life time , i.e. much more larger than the time necessary for muon beams to cross each other .",
    "therefore for the realistic muon colliders the results of ref.@xcite are not applicable and a new consideration is necessary .    we have found that for the realistic muon colliders there exist much more important effect connected with the finite beam sizes . in this paper",
    "we are going to show _ that accounting for the finite sizes of the colliding beams gives a finite cross sections for the processes like _ @xmath19 _ with the @xmath0-channel singularity in the physical region_. this is the main result of our paper .",
    "as an example , we reconsider reaction @xmath20 and show that the actual cross section of this process for the total energy @xmath21 gev is approximately @xmath22 fb for the typical transverse beam sizes @xmath23 cm .",
    "let us mention here that the effect of the finite beam size at the high  energy colliders is well studied both experimentally and theoretically ( for the review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the first time",
    "this beam  size effect ( bse ) was observed at the vepp-4 collider ( novosibirsk ) in 198081 during the study of the single bremsstrahlung in the electron ",
    "positron collisions @xcite .",
    "this year the bse was observed at hera in the reaction @xmath24 @xcite . in both cases",
    "the number of observed photons was smaller than it was expected according to the standard calculations .",
    "the decreased number of photons was explained by the fact that impact parameters , which gave essential contribution to the standard cross section of these reactions , were larger by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude as compared to the transverse beam sizes . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", the bse represents a remarkable example of the situation where traditional notion of the cross section and the standard formulae for the number of events are not valid .",
    "let us briefly outline the principal points of our consideration .",
    "the standard rules for calculations in high  energy physics correspond to the collision of plane waves which represent initial states of colliding particles . instead of this",
    "we consider collision of the wave packets which correspond to the particle beams in the initial state . as a consequence",
    "the standard rules are modified ( see detailed discussion in the section 3 ) .",
    "for instance , in the eq.([2 ] ) the following replacement takes place : @xmath25 here @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the matrix elements with identical final but different initial states .",
    "the difference in the momenta of the initial states is of the order of @xmath28 for the beam of the transverse size @xmath29 . due to this fact the singular propagators @xmath30 ( which are the reason for the pathological behaviour of the cross section )",
    "are now taken in the different points of the momentum space for the amplitudes @xmath26 and @xmath31 : @xmath32 consequently the infinite factor @xmath33 is replaced by : @xmath34 below we show that @xmath35 and that the main contribution to this integral is given by the pole of the neutrino propagator @xmath36 , i.e. by the real neutrino .",
    "this means @xcite that the effect under discussion is connected with the decay @xmath37 and subsequent scattering of the real muonic neutrinos on the @xmath38 beam . as discussed in detail below these neutrinos",
    "have a broad energy spectrum ( see fig .",
    "2 ) @xmath39 ( @xmath40 is the fraction of the @xmath41 energy carried by neutrino ) . in accordance with the eq.([7 ] ) , the total number of these neutrinos ( per one muon ) is proportional to the typical transverse beam size @xmath29 : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the muon life time , @xmath44 m. as a consequence the `` non  standard '' contribution to the cross section is also proportional to the transverse beam size @xmath45    let us mention here that in all the previous cases when the effects of the finite beam sizes have been studied , the results depend logarithmically on the beam size : @xmath46 in contrast to this , in our case ( @xmath0-channel singularity in the physical region ) the cross section ( [ 10 ] ) is _ linear _ proportional to the transverse sizes of the colliding beams .    the subsequent part of the paper is organized as follows : in the next section , as a realistic example of the processes with the @xmath0-channel singularity in the physical region , we consider reaction ( [ 4 ] ) and present its cross section ; in the section 3 we prove the basic formula used in the section 2 ; section 4 is devoted to the particular case  the reaction @xmath47 ; in the section 5 we present our conclusions ; appendix is devoted to the detailed consideration of a model process with a @xmath0-channel singularity in the physical region .",
    "in this section we show how the cross section of the reaction @xmath48 can be calculated .",
    "we introduce the following notations : @xmath49 is the square of the total energy in the center of mass frame , @xmath8 and @xmath50 are muon mass and width respectively , @xmath51 , @xmath52 is the 4-momentum of the final @xmath53 system , @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the momentum transfer in the @xmath0-channel and @xmath56 .    from simple kinematics",
    "it follows that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the component of the momentum @xmath59 which is transverse to the momenta of the initial muons .",
    "note , that @xmath60 and that for @xmath61 @xmath62    for @xmath63 ( or @xmath64 ) we write the cross section in the form @xmath65 where by definition @xmath66 corresponds to the region @xmath67 and @xmath68 corresponds to the region @xmath69 we will show that the main contribution to @xmath70 is given by the region of a very small values of @xmath9 inside the region ( [ 16 ] ) : @xmath71 where @xmath29 is the typical transverse beam size . in the region ( [ 17 ] ) the main contribution comes from the diagram with the exchange of the muonic neutrino in the @xmath0-channel ( fig.1 ) . since for such @xmath9",
    "the exchanged neutrino is almost real , the corresponding matrix element can be considerably simplified .",
    "first , the numerator of the neutrino propagator @xmath72 can be presented in the form @xmath73 here @xmath74 is the dirac spinor for the massless fermion with momentum @xmath75 and helicity @xmath76 .",
    "second , in the region of interest the upper block of the diagram ( see fig.1 ) corresponds to the decay @xmath77 . in this decay",
    "only left - handed @xmath78 is produced .",
    "therefore in the above sum the only term with @xmath79 is relevant .    as a result , in the region (",
    "[ 17 ] ) we present the matrix element @xmath13 in the form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the matrix element for the @xmath41 decay and @xmath82 is the matrix element for the @xmath83 process . in both of these subprocesses",
    "we take @xmath9 equal to zero .    using this equation",
    "we express the non  standard contribution through the muon decay width @xmath84 and the cross section @xmath85 of the @xmath86 process as : @xmath87 for unpolarized muon beams we have @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the azimuthal angle of the vector @xmath90 .",
    "let us call the coefficient in front of @xmath91 in eq .",
    "( [ 19 ] ) as _ the number of neutrinos _ : @xmath92    as it is clear from the eq.([19 ] ) , the standard calculation of the cross section turns out to be impossible due to the power  like singularity , since the point @xmath93 is within the physical region for @xmath94 .",
    "the main result of our investigation of the bse in the above process can be formulated as follows :    _ accounting for the bse results in the following treatment of the divergent integral in the eq.([19 ] ) _ :    @xmath95    the exact expression for the quantity @xmath29 will be given below ( see eqs.([42])([45 ] ) ) . we just mention here that it is proportional to the transverse sizes of the colliding beams . for the identical",
    "round gaussian beams with the root - mean - square radii @xmath96 this quantity is equal to @xmath97    hence , the quantity @xmath98 as it is noted in ( [ 7 ] ) .",
    "the contribution ( [ 22 ] ) comes from the region ( [ 17 ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to estimate that the contribution from the rest part of the region ( [ 16 ] ) is smaller . indeed , its relative value is of the order of @xmath99    using eqs .",
    "( [ 22])([24 ] ) and integrating the number of neutrinos ( [ 21 ] ) over @xmath100 ( in the region @xmath101 ) and over @xmath89 , we arrive to the following spectrum of neutrinos : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the life time of the muon at rest , @xmath104 m. the function @xmath105 is normalized to 1 : @xmath106 the plot of this function is presented in the fig.2 .",
    "the total number of neutrinos is equal to @xmath107    after the spectrum of neutrinos is obtained , the non  standard cross section for the reaction @xmath108 is given by the equation @xmath109    subsequent integration over @xmath40 can be performed without further difficulties . for the particular case @xmath110 such calculation is performed in the section 4 .",
    "here we are going to prove our result presented in the previous section ( see eq.([22 ] ) ) .    to begin with ,",
    "let us note that the standard notion of the cross section is an approximation itself .",
    "as is well known , it corresponds to the plane waves approximation for initial and final particles . in the real experiments the particles",
    "are confined to the beams of a relatively small size and it is the collision of such beams that leads to the measurable number of events .    in order to arrive to a more general formulae for the scattering processes , it is necessary to describe the collisions of the wave packets instead of the plane waves . in view of the fact that the movement of the particles inside a beam is quasiclassical ,",
    "simple and efficient technique for taking into account the beam  size effects in the actual calculations has been developed @xcite ( for the review see @xcite ) .",
    "below we present some results from the refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite which are essential for our discussion . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the energy and angular spread of the particles in the colliding beams .",
    "let us remind that in the standard approach the number of events @xmath111 is the product of the cross section @xmath112 and the luminosity @xmath113 : @xmath114 where @xmath115 for the head  on collision of the ultra  relativistic beams .",
    "the quantities @xmath116 are the particle densities of the beams .",
    "the transformation from the plane waves to the wave packets results in the following changes .",
    "the squared matrix element @xmath117 with the initial state in the form of the plane waves with the momenta @xmath118 and @xmath119 transforms to the product of the matrix elements @xmath26 and @xmath120 with the different initial states : @xmath121 here the initial state @xmath122 is the direct product of the plane waves with the momenta @xmath123 and @xmath124 , while the initial state @xmath125 is the direct product of the plane waves with the momenta @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "instead of the luminosity @xmath113 the number of events starts to depend on the quantity @xmath128 through the following formula @xmath129    the characteristic values of @xmath130 are of the order of the inverse beam sizes , i.e. @xmath131 usually this quantity is much smaller than the typical scale for the variation of the matrix element with respect to the initial momenta . in this case",
    "we can put @xmath132 in @xmath133 which results in the standard expression for the number of events ( [ 28 ] ) .",
    "otherwise , one should analyze the complete formulae which take into account the effect of the finite beam sizes .    in view of the discussion given in the previous section , this is indeed the situation which occurs in our case .",
    "now we want to show how the finite result for the number of events can be obtained starting from the complete formula ( [ 31 ] ) .",
    "let us first define the `` observable cross section '' by the relation ( compare with the eq.([15 ] ) ) @xmath134 where @xmath113 is the standard luminosity . by writing the number of events in such a way",
    ", we push the bse to the quantity @xmath135 .",
    "the study of the matrix element of the discussed process ( [ 18 ] ) suggests that the only quantity sensitive to the small variation of the initial momenta is the denominator of the neutrino propagator for small values of @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the transformations ( [ 29])([31 ] ) reduces to the following modification : @xmath136 where @xmath137 let us expand @xmath0 and @xmath138 up to the terms linear in @xmath139 .",
    "this gives @xmath140 where @xmath141 in the center of mass frame of the colliding muons @xmath142    as a result , the quantity @xmath33 in the eq .",
    "( [ 22 ] ) transforms to ( compare with the eq .",
    "( [ 6 ] ) ) @xmath143 it has already been mentioned that the above equation must be understood in the sense that we isolate the part , which does not possess the limit @xmath144 , to the quantity @xmath33 .",
    "all other quantities are smooth in the above limit and hence do not present any problem .    to perform the @xmath9-integration in ( [ 38 ] )",
    "we note that in the region ( [ 17 ] ) @xmath145 this approximation is justified because @xmath146 then we extend the region of integration over @xmath9 up to @xmath147 .",
    "the error introduced by this procedure is of the order of @xmath148 ( cf .",
    "eq.([24 ] ) ) . now the integral over @xmath9 along the real axis",
    "can be replaced by the integral over the contour @xmath149 which goes around the upper half plane of the complex variable @xmath9 : @xmath150 here @xmath151 the result is provided by the pole @xmath152 in the upper half plane .",
    "further integrations are simply performed with the help of the exponential representation @xmath153 subsequent integrations over @xmath139 and @xmath154 become trivial and we obtain @xmath155 after simple redefinition @xmath156 we get for the factor @xmath33 : @xmath157 this completes the proof of the eq .",

    "for the round and identical beams with @xmath164 the result of ( [ 23 ] ) can be obtained .",

    "it is interesting to note that the modest value of the non  standard cross section @xmath174 fb is the result of the product of the very small number of neutrinos @xmath177 and the huge value of the cross section for the @xmath178 transition averaged over neutrino spectrum @xmath179    first , let us compare this non  standard piece with the standard contribution to the same cross section .",
    "we remind that by `` standard '' contribution we mean the cross section of the same reaction calculated by the standard rules excluding the region of the final phase space where @xmath180 .",
    "this contribution was calculated @xcite with the help of the comphep package @xcite .",
    "the comparison of both contributions is shown in the fig.3 .",
    "it is seen that the non  standard contribution dominates up to the energies @xmath181 gev .",
    "second , we compare our non  standard cross section with the cross section for the single @xmath1 boson production in the reaction @xmath182 .",
    "the latter is completely standard process since it has no @xmath0-channel singularity .",
    "the reasonable estimate of its cross section can be quickly obtained with the help of the equivalent photon approximation .",
    "it gives the cross section @xmath183 fb at @xmath184 gev ( where it almost coincides with our non - standard cross section ) . at higher energies",
    "the process @xmath182 dominates as compared with the discussed process @xmath165 .",
    "we have considered the processes with the @xmath0-channel singularity in the physical region . as the result of our study the following statement is proved :    _ accounting for the finite beam sizes eliminates the singularity and makes it possible to obtain the finite result for the observable cross section . _    in contrast to all previously known cases , the beam  size effect for the processes with the @xmath0-channel singularity in the physical region turns out to be _ linear _ proportional to the transverse size of the colliding beams .",
    "the effect appears to be connected with the real decay of the unstable particle in the initial state followed by the scattering of its decay products on the opposite beam @xcite . evidently , the `` interaction region '' for such a scenario is only bounded if the finite sizes of the colliding beams are taken into account . in the traditional approach to the scattering process",
    "the initial states are the plane waves , which are not restricted to any finite volume . as a price",
    ", infinite cross section due to the @xmath0-channel singularity is obtained .",
    "the results presented in this paper correspond to the situation when the parameter @xmath185 or when the unstable particle life time is much larger than the interaction time ( for muon colliders this approximation is clearly perfect ) .",
    "if this parameter increases , stationary approximation becomes wrong at some point . in this case",
    "the effects of the initial particle instability and the beam size effects should be considered simultaneously .    as a practical example",
    ", we consider the process of the single @xmath1 boson production at @xmath186 colliders .",
    "we demonstrate that the standard cross section for a single @xmath1 boson production and the non ",
    "standard one are of the same order of magnitude in the energy region slightly above threshold of this reaction . for higher energies the relative size of the non  standard contribution rapidly decreases .",
    "we also note that precisely in the same way as above the processes like @xmath187 and @xmath188 can be considered . in this",
    "processes the @xmath0-channel singularity will be due to the electron neutrino and electron propagators respectively . in virtue of the discussion given above these processes",
    "will correspond to the collision of the real electron neutrino or electron produced in the @xmath189 decay with the opposite @xmath190 beam .",
