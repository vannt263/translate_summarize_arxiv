    "early type galaxies ( etgs ) , despite having masses and luminosities that span several orders of magnitude , obey a number of tight phenomenological laws . these , collectively known as `` scaling relations '' , include the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the color-@xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite relations and the fundamental plane @xcite . with their remarkably small scatter ,",
    "they impose strong constraints on the structure and evolution of etgs .",
    "morphologically , etgs are either classified as ellipticals ( es ) or lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies . in the late 1980s , based on new and more accurate spectroscopy , es were divided into two groups : pressure supported and rotation supported @xcite .",
    "it is thus particularly interesting to investigate how such dynamically distinct systems formed and evolved while still obeying the very same scaling relations . environment certainly plays a major role in galaxy evolution , as witnessed by the morphology - density relation @xcite : systems in denser surroundings are more likely to be etgs .",
    "the advent of integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) has brought a wealth of information to the field .",
    "the ` sauron `  survey discovered the existence of two kinematically distinct classes of etgs , slow and fast rotators ( sr and fr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the former are systems with little to no rotation , often exhibiting kinematically decoupled cores and misalignment between kinematics and photometry .",
    "the latter are flattened systems , compatible with rotational symmetry , where ordered , large scale rotation is important for the gravitational equilibrium .",
    "while overlapping with the existing dichotomy among etgs , the new classification crucially crosses the boundary between es and s0s , in that frs populate both morphological classes .",
    "indeed atlas@xmath0  ( the volume limited follow - up survey to ` sauron ` , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , found that many morphological es are frs .",
    "they suggest a new classification paradigm based on kinematics rather than morphology @xcite .",
    "+ atlas@xmath0  also presented the kinematic morphology - density relation ( kt-@xmath5 ) , linking the fraction of srs ( ) with the local number density of galaxies .",
    "is insensitive to environment density over 5 orders of magnitude , with a sharp increase observed only in the inner core of the virgo cluster .",
    "@xcite conclude by asking what would be measured in the denser environments beyond the local universe : does the fraction of slow rotators increase further or does it stay constant ?    addressing this question",
    "would give further insight on the processes that drive galaxy formation and evolution , and is indeed the goal of this work .",
    "we exploited the unique capabilites of the flames / giraffe multiplexed integral field spectrograph @xcite at the very large telescope ( vlt ) to investigate internal kinematics of galaxies in the densest environment , so to extend the density baseline of the kt-@xmath5 relation .",
    "after describing the observations in section  [ sec : observations ] , we present the data reduction and analysis in section  [ sec : data ] .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : results ] , followed by their discussion in section  [ sec : discussion ] and a summary in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "abell 1689 is a massive galaxy cluster at redshift @xmath6 @xcite . its regular , concentric x - ray contours suggest it is a relaxed system @xcite .",
    "an x - ray luminosity of @xmath7 makes it considerably more luminous than coma , which has @xmath8 @xcite and virgo @xmath9 @xcite .",

    "@xmath10 ) its comoving distance is 741 mpc , giving 1@xmath11 per 3.0 kpc , so that giraffe deployable integral field units ( see below ) sample up to 1  for most galaxies .",
    "giraffe permits the observer to target 15 objects simultaneously and we chose to target 30 galaxies as a compromise between sample size and integration time . our selection was based on a catalogue from @xcite , and in order to gain the maximum possible signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) , we initially selected the 30 etgs with the highest surface brightness within  ( including the brightest cluster galaxy ) .",
    "this sample was then subject to two practical constraints .",
    "we needed all of our targets to have high resolution hst imaging , which limited our choice to candidates in the innermost regions of the cluster .",
    "physical constraints from the instrument ( see section  [ sec : data : subsec : instrument ] ) ruled out some targets in the most crowded regions , forcing us to re - select from a reserve list .",
    "this left us with 29 galaxies inside the hst field of view and one outside ( galaxy 20 ) .",
    "we used f625w band imaging from the hst advanced camera for surveys , combined with _",
    "g@xmath12 _ and _ r@xmath12 _ band gemini imaging .",
    "see @xcite for a thorough description of these data .",
    "we present new data taken with the flames / giraffe spectrometer at the vlt unit telescope 2 .",
    "the l612w filter gives a resolution r of 11800 ( the minimum allowed on the instrument ) with a wavelength range of 5732 - 6515 @xmath13  ( 4858 - 5521 @xmath14 in the rest frame ) , which includes prominent absorption features of old stellar populations ( for comparison , ` sauron `  has a wavelength range of 4800 - 5380 @xmath13 ) .",
    "the observations were carried out between 24 may 2009 and 29 may 2009 , as detailed in table [ tab : obs.table ] , which also contains the observing conditions .",
    "the instrument provides 30 independent integral field units ( ifus ) , deployable anywhere on the focal plane .",
    "these are arranged in two positioner plates , each hosting 15 ; each deployable ifu is positioned by a magnetic button , with an accuracy better than @xmath15 and contains an array of 20 square microlenses , each with a side of @xmath16 on the sky .",
    "they are arranged in 4 rows of 6 ( with 4 `` dead '' corners ) for a total field of view of @xmath17 .",
    "each lenslet is then connected to the spectrometer with a dedicated optical fibre . alongside the 15 ifus",
    ", each positioner plate also houses 15 sky fibres .",
    "these are fully deployable just like the former but carry only one lenslet .",
    ".[tab : obs.table]a summary of the vlt / flames giraffe / ifu spectroscopy .",
    "the seeing was measured on site using telescope guide stars . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     since the magnetic buttons are larger ( @xmath18 ) than the ifu field of view , they can not be deployed closer than a minimum distance of @xmath19 thus constraining the sample selection : galaxies closer than @xmath19 on the sky must be allocated on different plates , if at all . as a result , some targets lying in the most crowded regions of the cluster were omitted .",
    "we proceeded to divide the sample in two equal sets , with galaxies numbers 1 to 15 assigned to plate 1 and galaxies numbers 16 to 30 to plate 2 .",
    "each plate was exposed 5 times for 2 hours , for a total of 10 hours exposure time per galaxy .",
    "we remark that , as detailed in table [ tab : obs.table ] , the seeing was comparable to the size of the lenslets ( @xmath16 ) .",

    "galaxies 3 and 17 have very high ellipticities , and are thus unlikely to be srs .",
    "galaxy 5 has high velocity dispersion , and also contains an inner disc ( r = 1.5 kpc ) in the hst imaging .",

    "we know that the rs does not necessarily trace the morphological etgs population , as it can include red spirals and omit blue ellipticals .",
    "how many etgs lying off the rs have we left out of our sample ? a rich , relaxed cluster like abell 1689 comprises a very small fraction of spirals , particularly in the core .",
    "in fact the ratio between the rs lf and the cluster lf goes from 1 at the bright end to 0.70 at = -22.5 @xmath91 .",
    "this means that including 10 `` blue '' galaxies in the faintest magnitude bins would remove the rs bias , leaving us with a color `` fair '' sample .",
    "these faint galaxies are more likely to be frs ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lum.func.frac ] ) , so the bias introduced by selecting galaxies on the rs leads us to overestimate .",
    "in fact , if we assume that these ten galaxies are all frs , and that they are distributed spatially much like the observed targets , we can determine the kinematic morphology - density relation for an unbiased sample ( with respect to color ) which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac.vs.density ] ( smaller red dots and red dashed line ) , with the relation from atlas@xmath0  ( smaller green dots and green dashed line ) . the good overlap between etgs and the rs in abell 1689 causes  to stay the same , whether the fraction is computed against the rs or overall galaxy population .",
    "this is not true in a less relaxed , spiral rich cluster like virgo ( fig .",
    "[ fig : frac.vs.density ] ) .      we know that in virgo ,  varies as a function of  ( fig .  [",
    "fig : lum.func.frac ] ) , and that the lfs of virgo and abell 1689 are different , in that virgo is relatively richer in brighter objects ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lum.func ] ) .",
    "since our sample is not fully representative of the abell 1689 population , what bias does this introduce in the measured value of ?",
    "a rigorous answer to this question is impossible , because we do not know if the sr lf varies as a function of redshift and/or environment . in particular",
    ", virgo is a small and dynamically young cluster , whereas abell 1689 is a massive , relaxed system .",
    "however , using a simulation , we can estimate what sr fraction we would measure in virgo with the same selection effects present in our abell 1689 sample .",
    "let us assume that the sr fraction as a function of magnitude is the same in abell 1689 and virgo ( reasonable given fig .",
    "[ fig : lum.func.frac ] ) and that the galaxies were selected only on their magnitude and no other properties ( not true , as discussed in section  [ sec : sample.selection ] , but reasonable given the substitutions required to comply with proximity constraints ) .",
    "using the actual abell 1689 lf , we drew random subsamples from the atlas@xmath0  virgo etg population .",
    "these samples yielded  = @xmath92 , in agreement with the actual virgo value of @xmath93 . thus despite being biased towards brighter galaxies , we should measure the same ; this is because we sample down to , but not including , the faintest magnitude bin of atlas@xmath0 , where  suddenly increases .",
    "we remark that the distribution of projected ellipticities  of our sample is different from that observed in virgo . since the former is richer in round objects , and since srs generally appear rounder , it follows that our sample could be biased towards higher values of .",
    "it may well be that the clusters @xmath30 distributions are different , in which case a higher fraction of round objects may increase .    another possible source of bias",
    "is the intrinsic shape of abell 1689 : according to @xcite and @xcite , abell 1689 is elongated along the line of sight , so that its measured @xmath76 is higher than what we would observe from another point of view . if the cluster length along the line of sight direction were @xmath94 times longer than the diameter of the sky projection , then the value of @xmath76 observed would be @xmath95 times the unbiased value . since the maximum reasonable value of @xmath94 is @xmath96 , in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac.vs.density ] @xmath97 is overestimated by at most @xmath98 , which does not significantly affect our results .",
    "finally we remark that the corrections to @xmath23 that we derived in section  [ sec : effect.pixel ] increase ; had we applied no correction , we would have 3.8 @xmath26 1.0 srs , so an even lower value of .",
    "abell 1689 has a higher average density than virgo , but the same value of . inside the cluster , in agreement with the findings of @xcite ,  rises with projected density . in the least dense region  is smaller than the atlas@xmath0  field / group value .",
    "given the low number of galaxies per bin , we can not rigorously claim that this is representative .",
    "however , a similar `` depletion '' is observed in the outskirts of virgo cluster @xcite .",
    "one explanation could be that massive srs are driven by dynamical friction towards the centre of the cluster .",
    "if these were originally distributed in the cluster like other galaxies , dynamical friction would reduce their orbital velocity and radius .",
    "since this process is more effective on more massive galaxies , it would concentrate srs ( more massive on average ) with respect to other galaxies .",
    "we demonstrated the use of flames / giraffe in ifu mode to perform a survey of 30 galaxies in abell 1689 at @xmath99 .",
    "the data has sufficient quality and spatial resolution to classify the majority of targets as either srs or frs . in summary :    1 .",
    "we find , in agreement with atlas@xmath0  results , that srs populate the high luminosity end of the lf ; the sr lfs measured from the virgo atlas@xmath0  sample and our abell 1689 sample are identical down to @xmath100 mag . 2 .",
    "the fraction of slow rotators in our sample is = @xmath2 .",
    "if we apply the same selection criteria to all virgo galaxies in atlas@xmath0 , we find the same fraction ( assuming that the distribution of srs with magnitude is the same in both clusters ) .",
    "this indicates that  is not affected by the average number density of the cluster . both abell 1689 and virgo average are in line with the atlas@xmath0  value for field and group environments .",
    "3 .   the fraction of srs increases towards the denser , central region of the cluster .",
    "this is in agreement with what was found in virgo , where srs concentrate in the cluster core .",
    "this could be a consequence of dynamical friction , as srs dominate the high mass end of the galaxy population .",
