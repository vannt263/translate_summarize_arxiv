    "the optical identification of x - ray sources is an important step to reveal cosmological evolution of agn / qsos as well as the evolution of super - massive black holes harbouring in their host galaxies .",
    "it is also a direct way to solve the origin of cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) .",
    "although many optical identifications of soft x - ray selected samples have been already made ( e.g. , mchardy et al . 1998 ; lehmann et al .",
    "2001 ) , it is essential to use a hard x - ray selected sample , because the energy of the cxb peaks at around 20 kev and the bulk of the cxb energy is thought to come from moderately obscured ( @xmath5 @xmath3 ) type-2 agns ( e.g. , comastri et al .",
    "1995 ; ueda et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the soft x - ray emission such as in the 0.2  2 kev band , which was used in the _ rosat _   surveys , is insensitive to sources with such high column densities , which can only be detected in the harder x - ray bands .",
    "therefore the optical identification of x - ray sources selected in a hard x - ray band ( e.g. , 210 kev ) is required to examine the evolution of type-1 and -2 agns and to solve the origin of the cxb .    in this context , we have been pursuing optical follow - up spectroscopy of hard x - ray selected sources .",

    "the survey area was a contiguous sky area ( @xmath7 deg@xmath8 ) near the north galactic pole , and we identified 33 x - ray sources among 34 sources . we have obtained further optical identifications of a subsample of the _ asca _   medium sensitivity survey ( ueda et al .",
    "the survey is a serendipitous source survey making use of many _ asca _   pointing observations made during a three year period ; from this catalog we selected 87 hard x - ray selected sources and have identified all of them ( akiyama et al . 2003 ) .",

    "we here concentrate on the data of the sis instrument ( burke et al .",
    "1991 ) , which was operated in the 4-ccd faint mode .",
    "the total field of view ( fov ) covered by the sis0 and sis1 had roughly a square shape with corners corresponding to ( ra , dec(j2000 ) ) = ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , ( @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , and ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 ) . a total survey area was about 530 arcmin@xmath8 .",
    "an average net exposure of 82 ksec ( per one ccd ) was obtained after standard data screening .",
    "we made sky images in the 3 energy bands , 0.77 kev , 0.72 kev , and 27 kev , from events of grade 0 , 2 , 3 , and 4 , discarding the very edge regions of each chip to avoid complexity due to satellite - attitude fluctuations .",
    "note that the sensitivity was not uniform over the fov also because of vignetting and gaps between the ccd chips .",
    "we calibrated the absolute fluxes by a correction factor of 10% so that they match with those obtained by the gis ( ohashi et al .",

    "we did not perform source detection initially . instead , we determined fluxes at positions of known ( soft ) x - ray sources , utilizing the image fitting method where the detector response was taken into account ( ueda et al . 1999 ) .",
    "this technique is effective to minimize source confusion when we have sufficiently deep ( and wide fov ) _ rosat _  data .",
    "analysis was made in the three energy bands .",
