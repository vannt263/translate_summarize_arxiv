    "we have combined the cdf and lhcb results by taking the product of their 2d profile - likelihoods  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we could not obtain the corresponding likelihood from d .",
    "the impact of this omission is mild due to the smaller uncertainties of the cdf and lhcb results .",
    "we have neither used the lhcb result on @xmath60 as only @xmath61 ( not the 2d likelihood ) was provided in ref .",
    "but we have included the flavour - specific @xmath3 lifetime @xmath62",

    "the 1d 68%cl intervals are @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath68-value for the 2d sm hypothesis @xmath69 is 3.2 @xmath70 .",
    "[ fig - scenarioiv],width=302 ]",
    "several authors have discussed the possibility of a sizable new cp - violating contribution to @xmath50 to explain the dmeasurement of @xmath71 @xcite by postulating new @xmath3 decay channels with large branching fraction . in such models also",
    "the width difference @xmath72 typically deviates from the sm prediction in ref .",
    "@xmath50 is dominated by the ckm - favoured tree - level decay @xmath73 .",
    "any competitive new decay mode will increase the total @xmath3 width , which lhcb finds as @xmath74 @xcite , implying @xmath75 in excellent agreement with the sm expectation @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "the new interaction will open new @xmath77 decay modes affecting precisely measured inclusive @xmath7 and @xmath78 quantities @xcite .",
    "furthermore , new decays mediated by a particle with mass @xmath79 will add a term of order @xmath80 to @xmath81 , while @xmath25 normally receives a larger contribution of order @xmath82 . in models involving a fermion pair @xmath83 in the final state ,",
    "e.g.  those with an enhanced @xmath84 decay @xcite , one can solve this problem through chirality suppression . the extra contribution to @xmath85",
    "is down by another factor of @xmath86 , while that to @xmath50 is affected by the milder factor of @xmath87 .",
    "quantities like @xmath88 will not be chirality suppressed .",
    "therefore it seems not possible to add large np effects to @xmath50 .",
    "phenomenologically it is thus much easier to postulate np in @xmath51 rather than @xmath50 , because @xmath51 is constituted by cabibbo - suppressed decay modes like @xmath89 . also here",
    "chirality suppression is welcome to avoid problems with @xmath90 , but inclusive decay observables like the semileptonic branching fraction or the unmeasured @xmath91 pose no danger .",
    "clearly , testing this hypothesis calls for a better measurement of @xmath92 .",
    "we have studied a scenario iv including the possibility of np in @xmath6 .",
    "we stress that sc .",
    "iv permits np in the @xmath93 transitions contributing to @xmath17 , but not in other @xmath94 quantities entering our fits , such as @xmath95 .",
    "further no new cp phase in @xmath96 , which would change @xmath97 , is considered .",
    "such a phase might further increase the hadronic uncertainty from penguin pollution , which is not an issue in the sm at the current levels of experimental precision .",
    "handy new parameters are @xmath98 @xmath99 , @xmath100 amount to @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively .",
    "the best fit values of the sm predictions are @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "@xmath105 is experimentally only weakly constrained .",
    "we illustrate the correlation between @xmath106 and @xmath107 in fig .",
    "[ fig - scenarioiv ] , relegating correlations of @xmath108 with @xmath109 to ref .",
    "the p - value of the 8d sm hypothesis @xmath110 , @xmath111 is 2.6 @xmath70 .",
    "we stress that too large values for @xmath112 are in conflict with other observables as explained above .",
    "we have also studied scenario iv without np in the @xmath3 sector ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "it could accommodate the main anomalies by improving the fit by @xmath115 , but with large contributions to @xmath116 : @xmath117 .",
    "we have performed new global fits to flavour physics data in scenarios with generic np in the @xmath1  and @xmath2  mixing  amplitudes , as defined in ref .",
    "our results represent the status of the end of the year 2011 . unlike in summer 2010",
    "the two complex np parameters @xmath26 and @xmath25 ( parametrising np in @xmath5 ) are not sufficient to absorb all discrepancies with the sm , namely the d  measurement of @xmath4 and the inconsistency between @xmath118 and @xmath119 . still in scenario",
    "i , which fits @xmath26 and @xmath25 independently , we find the sm point @xmath110 disfavoured by 2.4@xmath12 ; this value was 3.6@xmath12 in our 2010 analysis @xcite we notice that data still allow sizeable np contributions in both @xmath7 and @xmath3 sectors up to 30 - 40% at the 3@xmath70 level .",
    "the preference of sc .",
    "i over the sm mainly stems from the fact that @xmath118 favours @xmath38 which alleviates the problem with @xmath4 .    in order to fully reconcile @xmath71 with @xmath120",
    "we have extended our study to a scenario iv , which permits np in both @xmath5 and @xmath6 . while this scenario can accommodate all data , it is difficult to find realistic models in which the preferred np contributions to @xmath50 ( composed of cabibbo - favoured tree - level decays ) comply with other measurements .",
    "there are fewer phenomenological constraints on the cabibbo - suppressed quantity @xmath51 ; a possible conflict with @xmath90 can be circumvented with chirality suppression .",
    "np in @xmath90 and @xmath51 with the @xmath3 system essentially sm - like appears thus as an interesting possibility , requiring only a mild statistical upward fluctuation in the d  data on @xmath121 . clearly , independent measurements of @xmath122 , @xmath123 and/or @xmath124 are necessary to determine whether scenarios with np in @xmath51 and/or @xmath50 are a viable explanation of discrepancies in @xmath0 observables with respect to the standard model .",
