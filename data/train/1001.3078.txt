    "the ising model @xcite remains probably the most cited model in statistical physics .",
    "today , the _ isi web of knowledge _ abstracting and indexing service returns over eleven thousands records for the query on `` ising '' for time span from 1996 to 2010 . for _ inspec",
    "_ database ( for years 1969 - 2010 ) this number is almost doubled and reaches 19 thousands for _ scopus _ database ( for data range 1960 - 2010 ) .",
    "the latter means that during the last half of century @xmath18 papers refer to the ising model every year .",
    "the _ google _",
    "search engine indicates over 279 thousands web pages which contain `` ising model '' phrase .",
    "the beauty and the popularity of this model lies in both its simplicity and possible applications from pure and applied physics , via life sciences to social sciences . in the way similar to the percolation phenomenon ,",
    "the ising model is one of the most convenient way of numerical investigations of second order phase transitions .    in the simplest case",
    ", the ising model may be used to simulate the system of interacting spins which are placed at the nodes of graphs or regular lattices . in its basic version only two values of the spin variable",
    "are available , i.e. @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "this is the classical ising @xmath21 model . for a square lattice",
    "this model defines the universality class of phase transitions with analytically known critical exponents which describe the system behaviour near the critical point .",
    "the critical point separates two  ordered and disordered  phases .",
    "one of possible generalisation of the ising model is to enlarge the set of possible spin values ( like in the potts model @xcite ) .",
    "the ising @xmath1 model corresponds to three possible spin values , i.e. @xmath22 , ising @xmath23 allows for four spin variables @xmath24 , _ etc_. the ising @xmath25 model on various networks and lattices may form universality classes other than the classical square lattice ising model .",
    "the spin models for @xmath1 were extensively studied by several approximate techniques in two and three dimensions and their phase diagrams are well known @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath26 has also been investigated according to several procedures @xcite .",
    "the ising model @xmath1 on directed barabsi ",
    "albert network was studied by lima in 2006 @xcite .",
    "it was shown , that the system exhibits first - order phase transition .",
    "the result is qualitatively different from the results for this model on a square lattice , where a second - order phase transition is observed .    in this paper",
    "we study the ising @xmath1 model on two archimedean lattices ( al ) , namely on @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the topologies of @xmath2 and @xmath3 al are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - al ] .",
    "critical properties of these lattices were investigated in terms of site percolation in ref .",
    "topologies of all eleven existing al are given there as well .",
    "also the critical temperatures for ising @xmath21 model @xcite and voter model @xcite on those al were estimated numerically .        here , with extensive monte carlo simulations",
    "we show that the ising @xmath1 model on @xmath2 and @xmath3 al exhibits a second - order phase transition with critical exponents that _ do not _ fall into universality class of the square lattice ising @xmath21 model .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional ising @xmath1 model on @xmath2 and @xmath3 al lattices .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system can be written as @xmath27 where spin variable @xmath28 takes values @xmath29 ,",
    "@xmath30 , @xmath31 and decorates every @xmath32 vertex of the al . in eq .",
    "@xmath33 is the magnetic exchange coupling parameter .",
    "the simulations have been performed for different lattice sizes @xmath34 , 16 , 32 , 64 and 128 . for each system with @xmath32 spins and given temperature @xmath35 we performed monte carlo simulation in order to evaluate the system magnetisation @xmath36 .",
    "the simulations start with a uniform configuration of spins ( @xmath37 , but the results are independent on the initial configuration ) .",
    "it takes @xmath38 monte carlo steps ( mcs ) per spin for reaching the steady state , and then the time average over the next @xmath38 mcs are estimated .",
    "one mcs is accomplished when all @xmath39 spins are investigated whether they should flip or not .",
    "we carried out @xmath40 to @xmath41 independent simulations for each lattice and for given set of parameters @xmath42 .",
    "we have employed the heat bath algorithm for the spin dynamic .",
    "we evaluate the average magnetisation @xmath43 , the susceptibility @xmath44 , and the magnetic 4-th order cumulant @xmath45 :    [ eq - mchiu ]",
    "@xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48    where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the boltzmann constant . in the above equations @xmath51 stands for thermodynamic average",
    ".    in the infinite - volume limit these quantities exhibit singularities at the transition point @xmath52 . in finite systems the singularities are smeared out and scale in the critical region according to    [ ffs ] @xmath53 @xmath54    where @xmath6 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the usual critical exponents , and @xmath57 are finite size scaling ( fss ) functions with @xmath58 being the scaling variable . therefore , from the size dependence of @xmath43 and @xmath44",
    "one can obtain the exponents @xmath5 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "the maximum value of susceptibility also scales as @xmath59 .",
    "moreover , the value of temperature @xmath60 for which @xmath44 has a maximum , is expected to scale with the system size as @xmath61 where the constant @xmath62 is close to unity @xcite .",
    "therefore , the eq . @xmath63 may be used to determine the exponent @xmath9 .",
    "we have checked also if the calculated exponents satisfy the hyper - scaling hypothesis @xmath64 in order to get the effective dimensionality , @xmath65 , for both investigated al lattices .",
    "the dependence of the magnetisation @xmath43 on the temperature @xmath35 , obtained from simulations on @xmath2 and @xmath3 al with @xmath32 ranging from @xmath66 to @xmath67 sites is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - m ] .",
    "the shape of magnetisation curve versus temperature , for a given value of @xmath39 , suggests the presents of the second - order transition phase in the system .",
    "the phase transition occurs at the critical value @xmath52 of temperature .    in order to estimate the critical temperature @xmath52",
    "we calculate the fourth - order binder cumulants given by eq . .",
    "it is well known that these quantities are independent of the system size at @xmath52 and should intercept there @xcite .           in fig .",
    "4 the fourth - order binder cumulant is shown as a function of the temperature for several values of @xmath68 . taking two largest lattices ( for @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) we have @xmath71 and @xmath72 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 al , respectively .    in order to go",
    "further in our analysis we also computed the modulus of the magnetisation at the inflection @xmath73 .",
    "the estimated exponents @xmath5 values are @xmath74 and @xmath75 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 al , respectively .      to obtain the critical exponent @xmath9",

    "the calculated values of the exponents @xmath9 are @xmath79 for @xmath2 and @xmath80 for @xmath3 .",
    "yields effective dimensionality of the systems @xmath16 for @xmath2 and @xmath17 for @xmath3 .",
    "the above results , indicate that the ising @xmath1 model on @xmath2 and @xmath3 al _ does not fall _ in the same universality class as the square lattice ising model , for which the critical exponents are known analytically i.e. @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we have checked numerically , that ising @xmath21 model reproduces these critical exponents with reasonable accuracy for both studied lattices @xcite .",
