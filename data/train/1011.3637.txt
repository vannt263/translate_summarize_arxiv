    "potentials such as the infinite square well , the harmonic oscillator , the delta function well , and the finite square well are frequently discussed in textbooks@xcite as examples that have bound states . in this paper",

    "hence , the sign of @xmath21 depends only on the sign of @xmath22 . for both @xmath23 and @xmath21 positive ,",
    "it is not possible to obtain a positive value of @xmath12 for which @xmath24 is negative .",
    "thus , the condition on @xmath8 to have at least one bound state is @xmath25 which depends on the shape of the potential , not on its strength .",
    "equation   is a sufficient condition for a potential to have a bound state .",
    "it is not a necessary condition as the example of the harmonic oscillator potential shows .",
    "note that this general criterion for the existence of the bound state follows from a simple argument involving dimensional analysis and the variational principle .",
    "in practice , we can obtain various upper bounds of the ground state energy by calculating @xmath24 for suitably chosen trial functions .",
    "there is a tradeoff between improving the approximate ground state energy using a complex trial wave function and the ease of calculation .",
    "here we choose a normalized gaussian trial wave function @xmath5 with adjustable width , @xmath26 where @xmath27 is related to the width @xmath12 .",

    ". therefore , the number of bound states is finite for the gaussian well .",
    "the value of @xmath34 calculated from eq .   compared to the numerical solution is in table  [ tab : number_state ] .",
    "equation   implies that the number of bound states is a function of the ratio @xmath35 , which is a measure of the length scale @xmath12 of the wavefunctions.@xcite because @xmath36 , @xmath8 becomes a delta function in the limit @xmath37 , for which eq .",
    "( [ eq : bound ] ) gives @xmath38 , implying that there exists exactly one bound state for the delta function well.@xcite the reason for the half - quantum number is that the ground state has no nodes .",

    "the one - dimensional schrdinger equation has few analytic solutions , and most problems must be solved numerically .",
    "we first use a taylor s series to obtain a discretization of derivatives for a function @xmath41 and write the second derivative of the function @xmath41 in the three point central difference form @xmath42 where , @xmath43 is the step size . if @xmath44 is the number of mesh points and @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the maximum and minimum value of the variable @xmath47 , the step size @xmath43 is @xmath48    the solution of eq .",
    "is accomplished by discretizing it using eq .",

    "these cut - offs and the step size need to be adjusted to obtain the desired accuracy .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sch_dis ] ) is equivalent to the tight - binding approximation applied to a chain of atoms with spacing @xmath43 and one orbital per atom.@xcite we can develop a matrix representation of the schrdinger equation , with @xmath53 in the sub - diagonal and super - diagonal matrix elements and the diagonal elements are @xmath54 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : sch_dis ] ) can then be written as a matrix equation as , @xmath55    equation   is a matrix eigenvalue problem with a tridiagonal matrix of dimension @xmath56 ; thus there are @xmath57 eigenvalues . because all the matrix elements are real and the transpose of the matrix is equal to the matrix itself , it is a hermitian matrix , and hence all the eigenvalues are real .",
    "an efficient way of diagonalizing a tridiagonal matrix is to use the standard lapack routine dstevx,@xcite which stores the symmetric tridiagonal matrix in two one - dimensional arrays , one of length @xmath57 containing the diagonal elements , and one of length @xmath58 containing the off - diagonal elements , and returns the eigenvalues along with the eigenfunctions of the matrix .",

    "the ground state is symmetric with respect to the center of the potential ( even parity ) , and the first excited state is antisymmetric ( odd parity ) .",
    "the wave functions resemble those of the harmonic oscillator,@xcite because for @xmath61 , the dominant term in the expansion of @xmath62 is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "the virtue of the matrix method is that it can be applied to any potential for which the hamiltonian can be brought into a symmetric tridiagonal or bidiagonal matrix .",
    "however , for systems with periodic boundary conditions , the hamiltonian is no longer tridiagonal and we can not use the simple matrix method .",
    "a gaussian barrier can be constructed by changing the sign of @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : potential ] ) . because the condition in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bcondi ] ) is not satisfied , there is no bound state .",
    "the barrier formed in this way is an interesting example of tunneling .",
    "we start with the time energy uncertainty principle @xmath64 denote the energy of the incident particle by @xmath65 .",
    "the uncertainty in the energy is @xmath66 and for sufficiently small @xmath67 the energy of the particle @xmath68 is greater than the height of the barrier @xmath32 .",
    "tunneling will take place if in the time @xmath67 the particle can traverse the barrier .",
    "we take @xmath69 as the width of the barrier and write , @xmath70 from eqs .   and",
    "we find @xmath66 to satisfy the equation , @xmath71 the condition for @xmath66 to be real implies that @xmath72 which is the condition for tunneling .",

    "is the kinetic energy of the particle obtained from the  position - momentum uncertainty relation , with an uncertainty of @xmath73 in the particle s position .",
    "we see that for tunneling to occur , the kinetic energy of the particle must be greater than the difference between the height of the barrier @xmath32 and the total energy @xmath65 .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : theta ] ) implies that @xmath80 depends only on the ratio @xmath86 , a common feature of barrier tunneling .",
    "the dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath87 can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : transmission ] .",
    "it is evident that the transmission coefficient decreases as @xmath87 increases .",
    "as expected for @xmath92 , that is , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , implying no reflection from the barrier .",
    "thus far we have discussed different aspects of the potential from a quantum theoretic approach .",
    "the gauusian well ( or , barrier ) is not a long range potential , because it falls off faster than @xmath95 .",
    "however , it has a crucial advantage over the widely used ` finite square well ' potential in that it is continuous throughout the entire range @xmath96 $ ] , whereas the finite square well goes to zero discontinuously . in the following",
    "we describe two applications of this potential .",
    "the ` mean - field ' dynamics of a single nucleon in the field of all other nucleons is the starting point of nuclear many - body theory .",
    "the gaussian well potential is well suited for describing the interaction of a nucleon ( especially , a neutron ) with the heavy nucleus.@xcite the force between them is appreciable only over a very short distance , of the order of @xmath97 m , and in this range the forces are very large compared to forces holding atoms together . keeping in mind the three dimensionality of a nucleus",
    ", we can change our variable from @xmath47 to the radius vector @xmath98 in spherical polar coordinates , so that the potential can be represented by a ` half ' gaussian well , @xmath99 it is monotonically increasing with distance ( i.e. attracting ) and approaches zero very quickly as @xmath44 goes to infinity , reflecting the short - range nature of the nuclear force .",
    "the parameter @xmath33 can be adjusted to the experimental value of the nuclear interaction barrier . from the schrdinger equation in radial form ,",
    "one has @xmath100u = eu,\\ ] ] where @xmath101 is the azimuthal quantum number .",
    "it follows immediately that this equation is identical to eq .",
    "( [ eq : sch_tind ] ) for @xmath102 .",
    "it is left as an exercise to the reader to solve this equation using the numerical method discussed already and to deduce the single particle nuclear energy levels for @xmath102 by taking appropriate values of @xmath32 and @xmath33.@xcite for a potential such as the one in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gauss_half ] ) there will be no even - parity states ( because at @xmath103 there must be an antinode . ) .",
    "the gaussian barrier can also be very useful in analyzing a scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) .",
    "the basic idea behind a stm is quite simple .",
    "an atomically sharp metal tip is brought very close ( @xmath104  ) but without physical contact to a sample surface , and a small bias voltage ( 3 - 6 volts ) is applied between them . if the distance is small enough , an electron ( with an energy 3 - 6 ev ) can tunnel quantum mechanically through the potential barrier developed in between the tip and sample .",
    "this gives rise to the tunneling current that is the result of the overlap between wave functions of the tip - atom and the surface - atom .",
    "assume the metal to tip gap is a gaussian barrier with a height of @xmath105  ev @xmath106 in atomic units .",
    "an electron with energy of @xmath107  ev @xmath108 in atomic units approaches the surface .",
    "now from eq .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) , the transmission coefficient is @xmath109 if the tip is @xmath110  nm @xmath111 in atomic units from the surface , we have @xmath112 .",
    "however , it should be noted that for a large distance between the tip and surface , e.g. , if @xmath113  nm @xmath114 in atomic units , @xmath80 will become @xmath115 and practically , there will be no current to measure  !",
    "thus the magnitude of the tunneling current is extremely sensitive to the gap between the tip and sample .",
    "the position of the tip in three dimensions is accurately controlled by piezoelectric drivers .",
    "the tip is scanned in two lateral dimensions , while a feedback circuit constantly adjusts the tip height to keep the current constant .",
    "as we measure the current with the tip moving across the surface , information about the atomic nature of the surface can be determined by tracing the path of the tip .",
    "as a final example there is the alpha particle tunneling problem which also can be modeled with the gaussian barrier .",
    "an interesting double well potential may be formed by multiplying @xmath8 in eq .   by a factor of @xmath63 .",
    "because the potential @xmath116 is symmetric , the hamiltonian can be brought into a symmetric tridiagonal form . the numerical solution for this potential",
    "is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : double_well1 ] .",
    "because the barrier is finite the wave function extends into both wells .",
    "the ground state wave function is small but nonzero inside the barrier .",
    "assume the particle starts in the right well . from fig .",
    "[ fig : double_well1 ] we see that initially @xmath117 ( where , @xmath118 & @xmath119 are the ground state and first excited state , respectively ) is canceled on the left . as a consequence",
    "the particle will oscillate between the wells with the period , @xmath120 .",
    "thus the tunneling rate depends on the energy difference , @xmath121 , and a double well with a high or wide barrier will have a smaller @xmath66 than one with a low or narrow barrier .",
    "also , @xmath66 will become larger as the energy increases ( that is , as @xmath122 decreases ) .",
    "an example is a quantum well laser , based on the transition that an electron makes between the ground and first excited state of a double gaussian well . by choosing @xmath33 and @xmath32",
    ", we can tune the wavelength of the light emitted .",
    "another not so obvious case could be a qubit .",
    "the quantum bit , or qubit , is the simplest unit of quantum information .",
    "measurements give only two values : ` zero ' or ` one ' .",
    "it is described conveniently by a state in a two level quantum - mechanical system .",
    "a pure qubit state would then be a linear superposition of those two states .",
    "though the double gaussian well has multiple energy levels , it can be seen from fig .",
    "( [ fig : double_well2 ] ) that the relative spacing between the ground and first excited state is very small compared to that between the first and second excited states .",
    "therefore , the lowest two bound states can be effectively decoupled from the other states by choosing appropriate values of @xmath32 & @xmath33 .",
    "an electron making transitions between these two states can easily be considered as a ` charge qubit ' , a much discussed way for consistent quantum data storage .",
    "the author would like to thank sayan chakraborti , swastik bhattacharya , and shamashis sengupta for many helpful suggestions .",
    "he is grateful to professor deepak dhar for help in understanding different aspects of quantum mechanics .",
    "it can be thought as a potential similar to the well known woods - saxon potential .",
    "the schrdinger equation for woods - saxon potential has been solved for @xmath102 to obtain the nuclear energy levels .",
