    "the solar wind provides a natural environment to study mhd turbulence in a collisionless plasma . over the past few decades the launches of spacecraft such as voyager , helios , ulysses , _ wind _ , and",
    "ace have made available a significant amount of data for analyzing the solar wind mhd turbulence .",
    "the first theory of hydrodynamic turbulence , suggested by @xcite , known as the k41 theory , predicted a magnetic field power - law spectrum @xmath0 .",
    "this @xmath1 exponent arises from the nonlinear interactions of the homogeneous hydrodynamic turbulence in which energy is cascaded from large scales to small scales . for",
    "incompressible mhd turbulence where the cascading process is mediated by counter - propagating alfvn wave packets , the iroshnikov - kraichnan ( ik ) theory @xcite and some recent theories of strong mhd turbulence @xcite predict a power spectrum @xmath2 .",
    "one important concept in turbulence is intermittency .",
    "@xcite suggested that intermittent structures can affect the solar wind mhd turbulence power spectrum .",
    "they pointed out that the effect of intermittency in the solar wind mhd turbulence is to reduce the exponent of the power law spectrum .",
    "@xcite further suggested that intermittency is `` in the form of ropes , sheets or more complicated fractal forms . '' recently , in studying current sheets ( cs ) in the solar wind , @xcite found that the power spectrum of solar wind magnetic field behaves as k41 in periods that have abundant numbers of current sheets and behaves as ik in periods that are almost current - sheet free ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "since these current sheets are a source of intermittency , the study of @xcite supports @xcite .",
    "a current sheet is a 2d structure across which the magnetic field direction changes abruptly .",
    "current sheets can be of large scales .",
    "for example , the heliospheric current sheet and current sheets found in cme - driven shocks are all large scale current sheets .",
    "these are not the subjects of this study . here",
    "we consider current sheets that are of small scales .",
    "some current sheets occur in pairs",
    ". these can be tangential discontinuities ( tds ) , often forming the two boundaries of a magnetic hole ( see the review of @xcite and references therein ) , or rotational discontinuities ( rds ) which are the boundaries of an exhaust from a reconnection site ( see @xcite and the review of @xcite ) .",
    "comparing to magnetic holes , reconnection exhausts can be of larger scales .",
    "@xcite has found that the typical width of a reconnection exhaust is @xmath3 km and some reconnection exhausts can be as wide as @xmath4 km .",
    "consequently , these boundaries may be practically identified as `` single - current - sheet '' event .",
    "most current sheets do not occur in pairs .",
    "these current sheets can be generated through non - linear interactions in the mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "using ace data , @xcite examined magnetic field discontinuities which can have very small spread angles for bartels rotation 2286 ( day 7 to 33 in 2001 ) .",
    "they found that the statistical properties of these discontinuities form a single population and they are consistent with turbulence generated in - situ . by examining the probability density functions ( pdf ) of the magnetic field components from a 1d spectral code",
    ", @xcite showed that current sheets often occur at the super gaussian tail of the pdf .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that , at the inertial scale , in which the energy cascading rate is independent of the scale , the pdf of waiting times ( wts ) between mhd discontinuities that are identified in the solar wind using the method of @xcite and those from mhd simulations are very similar , suggesting that these structures can be explained as a natural result of the non - linear interaction of the solar wind mhd turbulence .",
    "other opinions exist . in an earlier work ,",
    "@xcite studied current sheets in the solar wind by analyzing helios 2 data using the minimum variance method to show how the magnetic field changed over selected time periods .",
    "@xcite were the first to suggest that these structures may be boundaries between flux tubes .",
    "@xcite analyzed an extended time period of magnetic field from the ace spacecraft and examined the distribution of the spread angle across the current sheets .",
    "he showed that the angle distribution has two populations and suggested that the second population , dominating at large angles , could be `` magnetic walls '' and originate from the surface of the sun . a solar wind that consists of many flux tubes can be viewed as a structured solar wind . in both",
    "the work of @xcite and @xcite , the solar wind is envisioned to be full of structures , the flux tubes",
    ". observed at a spacecraft , these structures are convected out with the solar wind . a similar scenario where structures convecting out from the sun has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "analysis on the cross helicity @xmath5 and residual energy @xmath6 by @xcite supported the proposal of @xcite .",
    "regardless the origin of a current sheet , @xcite developed a procedure to systematically identify these structures . using this procedure",
    ", @xcite examined current sheets in the solar wind and in the earth s magnetotail using _ cluster _ magnetic field data and concluded that current sheets are more abundant in the solar wind .",
    "later , @xcite examined over 3 years worth slow wind data using _ ulysses _ observations and found there were @xmath7 populations for the distribution of the spread angle across current sheets , in agreement with @xcite .",
    "perhaps a large fraction of current sheets identified in the solar wind are due to the non - linear interactions of the solar wind mhd turbulence , as shown in the work of @xcite",
    ". however , a statistical study such as @xcite can not rule out the possibility that some current sheets in the solar wind are boundaries of flux tubes .",
    "indeed , @xcite has used plasma data including proton density and temperature , helium abundance , electron strahl strength , etc . to identify possible plasma boundaries .",
    "plasma data , however , is often of lower time resolution than magnetic field data .",
    "furthermore , plasmas in different flux tubes may have similar properties except different velocities and magnetic field directions .",
    "therefore , to unambiguously separate these two populations can be hard .",
    "note , the occurrence rates of these two populations may have different radial dependence and/or different solar wind type dependence .    in this work , as an effort to identify flux tubes in the solar wind , we present a case study of two `` triple - current - sheet '' event using data from spacecraft _",
    "wind_. a triple - current - sheet event is where three current sheets occurred in a relatively short period of time .",
    "the reason that we want to search for a triple - current - sheet event is the following . in the flux - tube scenario ,",
    "the solar wind plasmas reside in different flux tubes and the solar wind magnetic field and plasma properties differ in these flux tubes .",
    "since flux tubes are 3d structures , we expect the boundary between two adjacent flux tubes to be curved and have small - scale ripples .",
    "this is shown in the cartoons in figure  [ cartoon ] .",
    "as these flux tubes are convected out past a spacecraft , depending on the relative configuration of the spacecraft trajectory and these ripples , one expects to observe most often a single crossing as in figure  [ cartoon ] ( a ) , and sometimes a double crossing as in figure  [ cartoon ] ( b ) , and occasionally a triple crossing as in figure  [ cartoon ] ( c ) .",
    "these three different cases are referred to as `` single - current - sheet '' events , `` double - current - sheet '' events , and `` triple - current - sheet '' events in this study .",
    "a triple - current - sheet event can be used to discriminate between the scenario where current sheets are generated in - situ and the scenario where current sheets originate from the surface of the sun . in the former case ,",
    "one expects no correlations between these current sheets in the sense that plasmas before and after these current sheet crossings need not show any relationships . in the latter case , however , the spacecraft traverses through two distinct plasmas in the sequence of `` i , ii , i , ii '' , so the observed plasma properties do not vary arbitrarily .",
    "we use the @xmath8 s plasma and magnetic field data from the 3dp ( @xcite ) and magnetic field ( @xcite ) experiments on the _ wind _ spacecraft .",
    "the data period was from september to october of 1995 , which was during the declining phase of the solar cycle .",
    "it is ideal to select data in the solar minimum period due to lack of transient structures such as cmes . for the data analysis method of current sheet identification ,",
    "the readers are referred to @xcite and @xcite .    in the following ,",
    "we first present a single - current - sheet event and a double - current - sheet event .",
    "we then present two triple - current - sheet events .",
    "components of the vector magnetic field in the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system , the magnitude of magnetic field , the @xmath8 components of the vector proton velocity in the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system , and the solar wind proton number density and proton temperature , respectively .",
    "the brown vertical line marks the location of the current sheet.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure  [ angleplot1 ] is a single - current - sheet event which occurred on 1995 - 09 - 21 .",
    "the current sheet in figure  [ angleplot1 ] is located at 14:32 ut and is shown by the brown vertical line . before the current sheet the magnetic field magnitude @xmath9 decreases and the proton density @xmath10 increases . in the scenario where a current sheet is the boundary of a flux tube , these changes across the current sheet occur because plasmas in different flux tubes have different properties ( as shown in panel  ( a ) of figure  [ cartoon ] ) .",
    "however , one need not invoke the flux - tube - crossing scenario to explain figure  [ angleplot1 ] .",
    "it can be simply a tangential discontinuity ( td ) or one side of a reconnection exhaust .",
    "indeed , careful examination shows that there was another small current sheet on @xmath11 ut , when @xmath9 decreased and @xmath10 increased .",
    "our selection procedure did not pick out this earlier current sheet .",
    "the change across the current sheets are alfvnic .",
    "the angle between @xmath12 and @xmath13 across the current sheet is @xmath14 . for the earlier current sheet ( that did not get picked up by our procedure ) ,",
    "the angle is @xmath15 .",
    "such parallel and anti - parallel alfvnic changes are always associated with a reconnection exhaust @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there was also a decrease of magnetic field and an increase of number density ( but not temperature ) between these two current sheets , providing another support for identification of a reconnection exhaust . therefore , figure  [ angleplot1 ] , although identified as a single - current - sheet event using the @xcite algorithm , is really part of a pair of a bifurcated current sheet @xcite .",
    "components of the vector magnetic field in the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system , the magnitude of magnetic field , the @xmath8 components of the vector proton velocity in the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system , and the solar wind proton number density and proton temperature , respectively .",
    "the two brown vertical lines mark the location of the current sheet.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    figure  [ angleplot2 ] is a double - current - sheet event .",
    "two current sheets can be identified around 11:11:48 ut and 11:12:26 ut . in the scenario of flux - tube - crossing , figure  [ angleplot2 ]",
    "can be understood as the spacecraft briefly crosses the magnetic wall between two flux tubes and then returns to the original flux tube .",
    "the schematic of this event is shown in the second panel of figure  [ cartoon ] .",
    "note that the temperature decreases and the proton density increases between the two current sheets .",
    "as in figure  [ angleplot1 ] , although figure  [ angleplot2 ] can be explained by the flux - tube - crossing scenario , it need not to be .",
    "the angles between @xmath16 and @xmath17 across the two current sheets are @xmath18 and @xmath19 degrees . unlike the first event ,",
    "this double - current - sheet is not associated with a reconnection exhaust .",
    "there was a slight but insignificant drop of the magnetic field magnitude , so it is unlikely to be a magnetic hole .",
    "the proton number density and proton temperature were also changed slightly at the two current sheets .",
    "these slight changes , together with the pulse - like changes of the @xmath8 magnetic field components , suggest that this structure could be pulsed alfvn wave @xcite .",
    "note , if this was a pulsed alfvn wave , then according to figure 3(a ) of @xcite and the fact that it has a duration of @xmath20 seconds , it would be a long duration pulsed alfvn wave .",
    "components of the vector magnetic field in the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system , the magnitude of magnetic field , the @xmath8 components of the vector proton velocity in the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system , and the solar wind proton number density and proton temperature , respectively .",
    "the three vertical lines mark the location of the current sheet .",
    "also see the online animation of the evolution of the unit magnetic field @xmath21 in this event.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    , but for the 1995 - 10 - 13 event .",
    "shown from top to bottom are the @xmath8 components of the vector magnetic field in the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system , the magnitude of magnetic field , the @xmath8 components of the vector proton velocity in the geocentric solar ecliptic ( gse ) coordinate system , and the solar wind proton number density and proton temperature , respectively .",
    "the three vertical lines mark the location of the current sheet .",

    "consider first the event shown in figure  [ angleplot3 ] . throughout the event",
    "both @xmath22 and @xmath23 did not change much .",
    "@xmath24 underwent a sharp change at 22:13:05 ut , the first current sheet , after which it only changed slightly , until 22:25:00 ut when another sharp change occurred and @xmath25 returned to values similar to those before 22:13:00 ut . at 22:25:00 ut at the third current sheet another sharp change in bx occurred .",
    "after the crossing , @xmath24 at and after 22:25:32 ut returned to a value comparable to @xmath24 at 22:24:30 ut , just before crossing the 2nd current sheet . from the third panel , we can see that the @xmath26 changes at the same times as @xmath24 .",
    "similar behavior also occurred to @xmath27 and @xmath28 . before crossing the first current sheet at 22:13:05 ut",
    ", @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) was almost a constant .",
    "after the crossing , @xmath29 increased and @xmath28 decreased .",
    "@xmath27 also became slightly more turbulent .",
    "at the 2nd crossing at 22:25:00 ut , @xmath27 and @xmath28 changed back to almost the same value as before 22:13:00 ut .",
    "then both @xmath27 and @xmath28 underwent another sudden change at the third current sheet crossing at 22:25:30 ut .",
    "after the third crossing , @xmath27 returned to a value similar to that before the 2nd crossing at 22:25:00 ut .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath30 ( the @xmath7-nd panel ) , the proton number density @xmath10 and the proton temperature @xmath31 ( the @xmath32-th panel ) did not vary much throughout the event . before the crossing of the second current sheet , around 22:24:30 ut , @xmath9 increased and @xmath33 and @xmath31 decreased .",
    "to better illustrate how the magnetic field direction evolves in this event , we have constructed an animation of the evolution of the unit magnetic field @xmath21 .",
    "two facts worth to note : 1 ) various plasma properties , including @xmath10 , @xmath31 and the @xmath8 components of @xmath34 and @xmath35 in the short period between 22:25:00 ut and 22:25:30 ut are very similar to those prior to 22:13:00 ut , suggesting that these are the same solar wind plasma . this can be clearly seen in the online animation .",
    "2 ) similarly , the solar wind before and after the short period are likely the same and it is different from that in 1 ) .",
    "one may attempt to explain this triple - current - sheet event as the spacecraft crossing three uncorrelated individual current sheets that are generated by independent non - linear interactions of the solar wind mhd turbulence .",
    "however , since independent current sheets have no correlations , the chance of the solar wind returning back to its original state after two independent current sheet crossings would be minute .",
    "alternatively , one may argue that the plasma between 22:13:05 ut and 22:25:00 ut represented a rather long - lived transient structure , and interpret the first two current sheets as the boundaries of this structure .",
    "in such a case , one has to explain why after the third current sheet crossing , both the magnetic field and the plasma return to values the same as inside the transient structure .",
    "another triple - current - sheet event is the 1995 - 10 - 13 event , which is shown in figure  [ angleplot4 ] .",
    "unlike the 1995 - 10 - 02 event , the @xmath8-components of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , in particular , @xmath24 and @xmath26 , suffered some additional changes at and around the three current sheets , making the 1995 - 10 - 13 event less convincing than the 1995 - 10 - 02 event .    the first current sheet located at 19:32:28 ut .",
    "both @xmath24 and @xmath27 showed a sudden jump across the first current sheet ; @xmath26 and @xmath28 did not show significant changes . @xmath22 and @xmath23 also did not vary across the first current sheet .",
    "the current sheet is therefore non - alfvnic . after crossing the first current sheet",
    ", @xmath27 was almost a constant for the next @xmath36 minutes until 19:39:40 ut , where the second current sheet was encountered .",
    "it increased across the second current sheet to a value similar to those prior to the crossing of the first current sheet .",
    "comparing to @xmath27 , @xmath24 was nearly constant after crossing the 1st current sheet for @xmath37 minutes and then gradually increased until 19:39:00 ut , after which it increases noticeably before the second current sheet . across the second current sheet , it dropped to a value similar to those prior to the crossing of the first current sheet .",
    "the third current sheet occurred at 19:40:15 ut . across the third current sheet , there was a significant change of @xmath27 and a small change of @xmath24 .",
    "the two black horizontal dashed lines indicate that @xmath24 ( @xmath27 ) before the first current sheet was similar to @xmath24 ( @xmath27 ) between the second and the third current sheets .",
    "the two magenta horizontal dashed lines indicate that @xmath24 ( @xmath27 ) between the first and the second current sheets was similar to @xmath24 ( @xmath27 ) after the third current sheet .",
    "note that the change of @xmath24 at the third current sheet was smaller than that at the second current sheet . after the third current sheet , @xmath24 kept increasing , until 19:40:30 ut .",
    "the value of @xmath24 after 19:40:30 ut is similar to those before 19:39:00 ut . as in the 1995 - 10 - 2 event",
    ", we also constructed an animation of the evolution of the unit magnetic field @xmath21 for this event .",
    "for the 1995 - 10 - 02 event , the angles between @xmath16 and @xmath17 across the three current sheets are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively . for the 1995 - 10 - 13 event , the angles between @xmath16 and @xmath17 are @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "while the three current sheets in the 1995 - 10 - 02 event are highly alfvnic , those in the 1005 - 10 - 13 event are not .",
    "current sheets are ubiquitous in the solar wind . they can be generated in - situ through non - linear interactions of the solar wind mhd turbulence @xcite , or represent the boundaries of flux tubes that originated at the sun @xcite .",
    "appearing in pairs , they could also be the boundaries of reconnection exhausts ( @xcite ) .",
    "if current sheets that are generated in - situ and those that are convected out from the sun have similar properties ( such as the spread angles , the current sheet width , etc ) , then discriminating these two scenarios can be hard .",
    "however , as shown in the rightmost cartoon in figure  [ cartoon ] , the presence of triple - current - sheet event provides a strong support to the flux - tube scenario .",
    "this is because in the flux - tube scenario the plasma and field changes across the three current sheets are intimately correlated : as the spacecraft crosses the three current sheets , the plasma before the first crossing and that between the 2nd and the 3rd crossing are the same ; the plasma between the first and the second crossings and that after the third are the same .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the scenario where the current sheets are generated in - situ . in the latter scenario",
    ", the plasma changes at the three current sheets in a triple - current - sheet event need not match .",
    "note that the identification of a triple - current - sheet event does not tell us how many single - current - sheet events are due to flux - tube crossing . as discussed earlier , since a reconnection exhaust can be of large scale @xcite",
    ", some single - current - sheet events we identify can be the boundaries of reconnection exhausts .",
    "identified an occurrence rate of @xmath43-@xmath44 reconnection events per month in solar minimum . in our study , we only consider current sheets which are abrupt ( width @xmath4510 seconds ) and whose spread angles are larger than @xmath46 , we find about @xmath47 `` single - current - sheet '' events per month .",
    "assuming @xmath48 are boundaries of reconnection exhausts , then the rest are presumably either generated in - situ or are the boundaries of flux tubes . assuming @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) of the rest are generated in - situ , then one gets about @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) single - current - sheet events that are flux - tube crossings per month .     if current sheets are boundaries of flux tubes that have a solar origin , e.g. super granules , then one may expect to find some statistical correlations between in - situ observations of current sheets and solar observation of super granules .",
    "indeed , @xcite have suggested that the sizes of the flux tubes , when tracing back to the solar surface , may correlate with the size of photospheric magnetic networks . in the work of @xcite , using ulysses observation , the distribution of the waiting time statistics of the current sheets were obtained . assuming these flux tubes do not split or merge during their propagation to @xmath53 au",
    ", then one may expect such waiting time statistics resembles the distribution of the magnetic network sizes .",
    "examining the waiting time statistics of current sheet , and in particular , its dependence on heliocentric distance , and its correlation with supergranule size will be reported in future work .    to conclude , we have examined @xmath7-month s worth solar wind data from the _ wind _ spacecraft and identified two triple - current - sheet events .",
    "the sequence of the observed magnetic field and plasma data in these two events are in agreement with the scenario where current sheets are flux tube boundaries , as depicted in figure  [ cartoon ] .",
    "unambiguous identification of flux tubes in the solar wind is important because these structures present an additional source of solar wind mhd turbulence intermittency .",
    "they can affect the power spectrum of the solar wind mhd turbulence @xcite as well as affecting the transport of energetic particles in the solar wind @xcite .",
