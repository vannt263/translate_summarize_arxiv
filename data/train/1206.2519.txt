    "recently , much attention has been paid to the investigation of the qcd phase diagram in terms of baryonic as well as isotopic ( isospin ) chemical potentials .",
    "the reason is that dense baryonic matter which can appear in heavy - ion collision experiments has an evident isospin asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the dense hadronic / quark matter inside compact stars is also expected to be isotopically asymmetric . to describe the above mentioned realistic situations , i.e. when the baryonic density is comparatively low , usually different nonperturbative methods or effective theories such as chiral effective lagrangians and especially nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) type models @xcite are employed . in this way ,",
    "the qcd phase diagram including chiral symmetry restoration @xcite , color superconductivity @xcite , and charged pion condensation ( pc ) phenomena @xcite were investigated under heavy - ion experimental and/or compact star conditions , i.e. in the presence of such external conditions as temperature , chemical potentials and possible external ( chromo)magnetic fields ( see the above references ) .    obviously , the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl models depend on the cutoff parameter which is typically chosen to be of the order of 1 gev , so that the results of their usage are valid only at _ comparatively low energies , temperatures and densities ( chemical potentials)_. moreover , there exists also a class of renormalizable theories , the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional chiral gross  neveu ( gn ) type models @xcite , model '' instead of `` chiral gn model '' for ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models with _ a continuous chiral symmetry _ , since the chiral structure of the lagrangian is the same as that of the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl model . ] that can be used as a laboratory for the qualitative simulation of specific properties of qcd at _ arbitrary energies_. renormalizability , asymptotic freedom , as well as the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry ( in vacuum ) are the most fundamental inherent features both for qcd and all gn type models . in addition , the @xmath1 phase diagram is qualitatively the same for the qcd and gn models @xcite ( here @xmath2 is the quark number chemical potential and @xmath3 is the temperature ) .",
    "note also that the gn type models are suitable for the description of physics in quasi one - dimensional condensed matter systems like polyacetylene @xcite .",
    "it is currently well understood ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) that the usual _ no - go _ theorem @xcite , which generally forbids the spontaneous breaking of any continuous symmetry in two - dimensional spacetime does not work in the limit @xmath4 , where @xmath0 is the number of colored quarks .",
    "this follows from the fact that in the limit of large @xmath0 the quantum fluctuations , which would otherwise destroy a long - range order corresponding to a spontaneous symmetry breaking , are suppressed by @xmath5 factors .",
    "thus , the effects inherent for real dense quark matter , such as cooper pairing phenomenon ( spontaneous breaking of the continuous @xmath6 symmetry ) or charged pion condensation ( spontaneous breaking of the continuous isospin symmetry ) might be simulated in terms of a simpler ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gn - type model , though only in the leading order of the large @xmath0 approximation ( see , e.g. , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "this paper is devoted to investigation of the charged pion condensation ( pc ) phenomenon in the framework of the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional njl model with two quark flavors and in the presence of the quark number ( @xmath2 ) as well as isospin ( @xmath7 ) chemical potentials .",
    "the consideration is performed in the leading order of the @xmath5-expansion . in our previous papers @xcite the phase diagram of the above mentioned massless or massive njl@xmath8 model",
    "was already investigated in the case of homogeneous , i.e. independent of space coordinate , order parameters ( chiral and charged pion condensates ) .",
    "the situation corresponds to the conserved lorentz and spatial translational invariance and is adequate to physical systems in vacuum , i.e. at zero chemical potentials .",
    "however , in dense baryonic matter , i.e. at nonzero quark number chemical potential , there might appear new phases with a spatially inhomogeneous chiral and/or charged pion condensates which destroy both chiral and/or isospin as well as spatial translational invariances of a system .",
    "in particular , the possibility of the phase with inhomogeneous chiral condensate was discussed in the framework of both ( 1 + 1)-dimensional @xcite and ( 3 + 1)-dimensional @xcite models . at the same time the possibility of the phase with inhomogeneous charged pion condensation is less investigated .",
    "model in @xcite .",
    "it was claimed there that inhomogeneous pc phase is possible only at rather high values of an isotopic chemical potential , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 mev is a cutoff parameter .",
    "so this result might be out of the scope of a model application .",
    "moreover , the authors of @xcite made some technical simplifications in their research of the inhomogeneous pc phenomenon . ]    thus , in this paper , in contrast to @xcite , we consider the phase portrait of the above mentioned massive ( 1 + 1)-dimensional njl model with two chemical potentials , @xmath2 and @xmath7 , in the leading order of the @xmath5-expansion taking into account the possibility that the charged pion condensate might become spatially inhomogeneous . the temperature is taken to be zero .",
    "for simplicity , for the chiral condensate we use a spatially homogeneous ansatz .",
    "( in contrast , in our previous paper @xcite the spatially inhomogeneous ansatz for the chiral condensate and homogeneous one for the charged pion condensate was used in the framework of the same massless njl@xmath8 model . )",
    "notice once more , the isotopic asymmetry is an inevitable property of dense quark matter which might be created in heavy - ion collision experiments or inside compact stars .",
    "so , we believe that such a simplified study in the framework of the two - dimensional njl model with isospin chemical potential could shed new light on the properties of real dense baryonic matter and will provide a deeper understanding of the charged pc phenomenon .",
    "in particular , it is shown in our paper that in the framework of the model under consideration a pc phase with _",
    "nonzero baryon density _ is realized just in the case of inhomogeneous charged pion condensate but not in the case of homogeneous one . in analogy , one can expect that in real ( 3 + 1)-dimensional dense hadronic / quark matter the charged pc phenomenon is realized rather with inhomogeneous pion condensate than with spatially homogeneous one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we derive , in the leading order of the large @xmath0-expansion , the general expression for the thermodynamic potential of the two - flavored massive njl@xmath8 model with quark number chemical potential @xmath2 and isospin chemical potential @xmath7 in the case of spatially homogeneous chiral condensate and inhomogeneous pc .",
    "first , in sec .",
    "iii we reduce our consideration to the case of homogeneous pc and find that in this case only a pc phase with _ zero density _ of quarks is possible in the model .",
    "second , in sec .",
    "iv it is shown that charged pc phase with _ nonzero quark density _ in the framework of the model is possible only with spatially inhomogeneous charged pion condensate .",
    "final sec .",
    "v presents a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "the discussion of some technical problems are relegated to two appendices .",
    "we consider a ( 1 + 1)-dimensional njl@xmath8 model to mimic the phase structure of real dense quark matter composed of two massive quark flavors ( @xmath11- and @xmath12- quarks ) .",
    "its lagrangian has the form : @xmath13q+ \\frac { g}{n_c}\\big [ ( \\bar qq)^2+(\\bar q\\mathrm{i}\\gamma^5\\vec\\tau q)^2 \\big ] , \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the quark field @xmath14 is a flavor doublet ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 ) and color @xmath0-plet ( @xmath17 ) as well as a two - component dirac spinor ( the summation in ( [ 1 ] ) over flavor , color , and spinor indices is implied ) ; @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) are pauli matrices ; the quark number chemical potential @xmath2 in ( [ 1 ] ) is responsible for the nonzero baryonic density of quark matter , whereas the isospin chemical potential @xmath7 is taken into account in order to study properties of quark matter at nonzero isospin densities ( in this case the densities of @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks are different ) .",
    "the dirac gamma matrices in two - dimensional spacetime have the following form : @xmath20 evidently , the model ( [ 1 ] ) is a simple generalization of the original ( 1 + 1)-dimensional gross - neveu model @xcite with a single massless quark color @xmath0-plet to the case of two massive quark flavors and additional chemical potentials . as a result , in the case under consideration we have a modified flavor symmetry group , which depends essentially on whether the bare quark mass @xmath21 and isospin chemical potential @xmath7 take zero or nonzero values .",
    "indeed , at @xmath22 the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant under transformations from the chiral @xmath23 group .",
    "then , at @xmath24 this symmetry is reduced to @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the third component of the isospin operator ( here and above the subscripts @xmath27 mean that the corresponding group acts only on left , right handed spinors , respectively ) .",
    "evidently , this symmetry can also be presented as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the isospin subgroup and @xmath30 is the axial isospin subgroup .",
    "quarks are transformed under these subgroups as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . in the case",
    "@xmath33 the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) is invariant with respect to the @xmath34 , which is a diagonal subgroup of the chiral @xmath35 group .",
    "finally , in the most general case with @xmath36 the initial model ( [ 1 ] ) is symmetric under the above mentioned isospin subgroup @xmath29 .",
    "in addition , in all foregoing cases the model is invariant under color su(@xmath0)- , baryon charge @xmath37- and electric charge @xmath38 groups .    the linearized version of the lagrangian ( [ 1 ] ) , which contains composite bosonic fields @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 , has the following form : @xmath42q   -\\frac{n_c}{4g}\\big [ \\sigma\\sigma+\\pi_a\\pi_a\\big ] .",

    "furthermore , it is clear that the bosonic fields ( [ 200 ] ) are transformed under the isospin @xmath29 subgroup in the following manner : @xmath44 i.e the expression ( @xmath45 ) remains unchanged under transformations of the isospin subgroup @xmath29 .    to avoid the _ no - go _",
    "theorem @xcite , which forbids the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries in the considered case of one space dimension , we restrict the discussion only to the leading order of the large @xmath0 expansion ( i.e. to the case @xmath46 ) , where this theorem is not valid @xcite .",
    "in particular , the effective action @xmath47 can be found in this approximation through the relation : @xmath48[dq]\\exp\\bigl(\\mathrm{i}\\int\\tilde   l\\,d^2    x\\bigr),\\label{a1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath49 is a normalization constant .",

    "however , first of all let us consider the case of spatially homogeneous condensates , i.e. the @xmath105 case .",

    "when studying the phase structure , the quantity @xmath126 is still treated as a free parameter , however instead of the massive parameter @xmath124 of the model we will use a dimensionless parameter , @xmath133 . as a result , one can see that in the massive njl@xmath8 model the dimensional transmutation effect is absent formally . indeed , both before and after renormalization this massive model is parameterized by one massive- and one dimensionless quantity .",

    "we have in the initial njl@xmath8 model the same relation between the pion mass and the dynamical quark mass in vacuum as in some njl - type models in the realistic case of the ( 3 + 1)-spacetime @xcite .",

    "in this section , the possibility for the ground state of the initial njl@xmath8 model ( 1 ) with spatially inhomogeneous charged pion condensate is investigated .",

    "since such a constraint with certain boundary conditions imposed for any system is equivalent to its consideration in a space with nontrivial topology , we have studied in @xcite the initial model ( 1 ) in the spacetime @xmath181 ( spatial coordinate is compactified ) and proved that at some boundary conditions for spinor fields the charged pcd phase is realized in the system .    in this paper",
    ", we have proved that a spatial inhomogeneity of pc condensate is also a factor which promotes the appearance of pcd phases on the phase diagram of the njl@xmath8 model ( 1 ) . indeed ,",
    "if consideration of dense quark matter is performed in terms of homogeneous pion condensates , then pcd phase is absent on the phase diagram of the model ( 1 ) ( see fig .",
    "however , if the spatial modulation of pion condensates is taken into account in the form ( 10 ) , then two pcd phases appear on the phase diagram of the model ( 1 ) ( those are ipc@xmath182 and ipc@xmath8 phases of fig .",
    "3 ) .    in summary , we conclude that charged pion condensation phenomenon of dense and isotopically asymmetric",
    "quark / hadron matter is more preferable to be spatially inhomogeneous than homogeneous .",
    "finally , we would like to discuss the reliability of the main result of our paper and try to predict what might happen with the pcd phase in the framework of a more general ansatz for condensates . to simplify the problem ,",
    "let us consider the case of massless njl@xmath8 model ( 1 ) with @xmath93 , with an evident generalization of the ansatz ( [ 6 ] ) .",
    "indeed , if @xmath93 , then it is possible to study the phase structure of the model in terms of the following simultaneous spatial modulations of the chiral and pion condensates @xmath183 evidently , there are three particular cases of ( [ 60 ] ) .",
    "i ) the choice @xmath184 correspongs to spatially homogeneous condensates and the phase structure of the model for this parameterization was studied in @xcite .",
    "ii ) then , the choice @xmath185 is really the ansatz ( [ 6 ] ) at @xmath93 .",
    "iii ) finally , the phase structure of the model under the constraint @xmath105 was studied in @xcite .",
    "recall that in cases i ) and iii ) the pcd phase does not appear at the phase diagram .",
    "we have made preliminary estimations of the phase structure of the massless model ( 1 ) in the framework of the ansatz ( [ 60 ] ) and found that 1 ) the phase with @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath188 , and @xmath142 is absent .",
    "2 ) there is an absolute minimum of the tdp corresponding to spatially inhomogeneous pcd phase with @xmath188 , @xmath142 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 .",
    "3 ) for the same values of chemical potentials there is an equivalent tdp extremum , corresponding to a chiral spiral phase , where @xmath186 , @xmath187 , @xmath191 , and @xmath192 .",
    "it means that inside an inhomogeneous pcd phase , bubbles of the inhomogeneous phase with chiral spiral are allowed to exist and vice versa . by analogy",
    ", one might expect that in the more physically interesting case with @xmath193 , the spatially inhomogeneous charged pcd phase would continue to be present at the phase diagram of the model ( 1 ) , even if an arbitrary more general parameterization of condensates is used .",
    "let us denote the integral in the left hand side of ( [ int ] ) by @xmath197 ( recall , there @xmath158 is a real quantity ) .",
    "it well - known that in quantum field theory any loop @xmath114-integration is performed in the supposition that @xmath114 is a shorthand notation for @xmath198 , where @xmath199 . in this case",
    "the causality of the theory is preserved . taking this circumstance in mind",
    ", we see that in ( [ int ] ) the integration contour at @xmath200 ( @xmath201 ) lies above ( below ) the singularity point @xmath202 of an integrand function .",
    "hence , it is possible to perform in ( [ int ] ) the wick rotation of the integration contour and to direct it along the imaginary axis of the complex @xmath114-plane . in thus obtained integral one can change an integration variable , @xmath203 . as a result ,",
    "we come to the relation @xmath204 in the last integral of ( [ b1 ] ) one can again change an integration variable , @xmath205 .",
    "hence , @xmath206 the last integral in ( [ b2 ] ) can be easily taken using the integration by part method .",
    "thus , up to an omitted infinite term which does not depend on @xmath158 , we obtain @xmath207 .",
