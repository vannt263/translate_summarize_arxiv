    "so far , the cb model has been very successful in predicting / reproducing the main observed properties of long duration grbs ( e.g. , their rate , location in star formation regions , association with core collapse sne of type ib / c , typical photon energy , multi - pulse structure , pulse shape and duration , spectral evolution of the individual pulses and large photon polarization ) and the observed correlations between them ( see , e.g. , dado et al .",

    "scenario iii has not been studied yet in detail with numerical hydrodynamical codes ( ginzburg & balberg 2012 ) .",
    "however , scenario iii is strongly suggested by observations of snn of type ib / c and by the success of the cb model of grbs in predicting the main observed properties of long grbs produced in sne of type ic .    in this letter",
    "we use a simple analytical model based on only a few general assumptions to derive a closed form expression for the bolometric luminosity of slsne in scenario iii .",
    "it involves only few adjustable parameters .",
    "we use it to demonstrate that collisions between the fast ejecta from core collapse sne of types ib / c and their massive circum - stellar shells , which were ejected in eruptions of their massive progenitors in the years preceeding their sn explosion , together with a modest amount of radioactive isotopes , which were synthesized in the sn explosion and deposited in the ejecta , can reproduce quite well the bolometric light - curves of both the supernovae that were observed in association with grbs and those of the recently discovered slsne without an observed grb .",
    "we conclude with a short discussion of the implications for sn explosions and grbs .",
    "the observed narrow lines in sneic indicate that the dense circum stellar shells ( css ) that emit them are expanding with a velocity of a few hundreds km / s at a typical distance of @xmath9 cm from the exploding star , and have a typical baryon density @xmath10 and a typical mass @xmath11 .",

    "@xmath12 must be replaced by @xmath20 .",
    "the thermal expansion speeds of the sn and cs shells are negligible compared to their radial velocities and their merger is completed within relatively a short time .",
    "consider now the collision in the rest frame of the cs shell .",
    "most of the kinetic energy of the sn ejecta is carried by atomic nuclei of mass @xmath21 and charge @xmath22 .",
    "for @xmath23 , their typical kinetic energies is @xmath24 mev . in sneic ,",
    "the cs shells consists mainly of the hydrogen and helium layers , which were stripped off from the progenitor star sometime before the sn explosion .",
    "the sn ejecta from such a massive star stripped off of its hydrogen and helium layers , consists mainly of nuclei heavier than helium nuclei .",
    "such nuclei lose their kinetic energy in the cs shell mainly by coulomb interactions with electrons ( ionization and scattering off free electrons ) at a rate which is given approximately by the bethe - bloch energy loss rate of sub - relativistic nuclei in matter .",
    "for ejecta with velocity @xmath25 km / s , @xmath26 , they lose their energy in the cs shell within @xmath27 , whereas the typical column density of cs shells is a few @xmath28 .",
    "consequently , the kinetic energy deposition is mainly near the interface of the colliding shells , and it lasts relatively a very short time .",
    "this energy is converted almost instantaneously to thermal ( black body ) radiation ( @xmath29 ) by bremsstrahlung and multiple scattering of the knocked on electrons , and is transported from the collision zone to the entire cs shell by diffusion and shock wave .",

    "however , the early time - photospheric velocity that was inferred , e.g. , from the broad lines in the spectrum of sn1998bw ( patat et al . 2000 ) decreased by a factor 4 from @xmath78 40,000 km s@xmath83 to @xmath84 km s@xmath83 within the first 30 days after the explosion . if these velocities were the bulk motion c.m",

    "the typical observed expansion velocities ,  5000 km / s , during the nebular phase of sne associated with observed long duration grb imply kinetic energy release of only @xmath92 erg typical to ordinary sn explosions and do not support an `` hypernovae '' origin of sn - grbs .",

    "these large masses were inferred mainly from the peak - luminosity in the photospheric phase , while in our model , and in reality , a large part of it could be supplied by the collision between the sn shell and the cs shell .",
    "the inferred mass from the nebular phase is highly model dependent since it depends on the fraction of the radioactive energy release that is absorbed in the sn shell that depends on the unknown mass of the shell and its density distribution as function of time , and on the density distribution of @xmath1ni within it : the fraction of the total @xmath77-ray energy that is absorbed in the sn shell is @xmath93 . for nearly - transparent sn shells , @xmath94 , and only a fraction @xmath95 of the total @xmath77-ray energy",

    "hence , in the models of mazzali and collaborators , a much larger mass of @xmath1ni was required in order to power the observed luminosity of sne - grb in both the photospheric and nebular phases . however , because the radius of of the sn shell expands like @xmath96 , @xmath97 decreases like @xmath98 . neglecting other losses , the luminosity powered by the decay of @xmath1co must decline then like @xmath99 . the observed bolometric light - curve of sn1998bw during the time interval 300 - 778 day , however , displayed an exponential decay consistent with that of @xmath1co without the @xmath98 modulation .",
