    "wind power is now widely recognized as an important part of the global energy mix , and the actors of the energy industry have no choice but to cope with the intermittent and to a large extent unpredictable nature of the wind power production .",
    "in particular , as the guaranteed purchase schemes are either phased out or replaced with more market - oriented subsidies , the wind power producers face the need to sell the future power production in the open markets in the absence of precise knowledge of the volume to be produced .",
    "the need of wind power producers to adjust their delivery volume estimates as the forecast becomes more precise is one of the factors behind the development of intraday electricity markets , at which power can be traded up to 45 minutes prior to delivery .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine the optimal strategies for selling the future power production of a single wind park for a wind producer who has access to imperfect dynamically updated forecast of the future production , which becomes progressively more precise as the production horizon draws near .",
    "we formulate this problem as a stochastic optimization problem where the power producer aims to maximize the expected gain from selling electricity penalized by terms accounting for market illiquidity and the extra cost of using the adjustment market . to solve this problem",
    ", we develop a stochastic model for the forecast evolution , and determine the optimal trading strategy which is updated dynamically as new forecast information becomes available .",
    "this allows to quantify the optimal expected gain for the producer , and to compare the expected gain under different assumptions on the forecast dynamics , thus quantifying the economic value of different forecasts .",

    "since some of the turbine equipment consumes power , the actual realized power production may sometimes have small negative values ; to remove this effect , the normalized power output is truncated from below by @xmath4 .    to build a model for the normalized output power ,",

    "it is also quite close to the weibull distribution , which is the parametric model of choice for wind speed data ; * the log - normal distribution is analytically tractable and allows to introduce a dynamical aspect into the model via a brownian motion .",
