    "the study of r - modes in rotating neutron stars has generated great interest in recent times from two points of view .",
    "on one hand , r - modes of rotating neutron stars could be possible sources of detectable gravitational waves . on the other hand , the gravitational radiation driven instability of r - modes @xcite might play an important role in regulating spins of young as well as old , accreting neutron stars in low mass x - ray binaries(lmxbs ) .",
    "the latter situation has been strengthened by the fact that the spin distribution of pulsars has an upper limit at 730 hz @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that the fastest rotating pulsar has a spin frequency 716 hz @xcite .",
    "the bulk viscosity of neutron star matter is an important issue in connection with the damping of the r - mode instability in rotating neutron stars .",
    "the r - mode instability may be suppressed through different mechanisms .",
    "it was shown that the damping of the instability by the large hyperon bulk viscosity coefficient could be an efficient mechanism @xcite .",
    "however , it may be suppressed by several orders of magnitude when neutrons , protons or hyperons are superfluid @xcite .",
    "this study was later extended to the calculation of bulk viscosity due to other exotic forms of matter such as unpaired quark matter @xcite , quark - hadron mixed phase @xcite and color superconducting quark matter @xcite .",
    "another possibility of damping the r - mode instability is the mutual friction between inter - penetrating neutron and proton superfluids @xcite .",
    "the superfluidity of neutron star matter plays a significant role on the damping of the r - modes in neutron stars .",
    "it was shown that superfluid particles taking part in non - leptonic weak processes involving hyperons might reduce the hyperon bulk viscosity coefficient by several orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "recently , we have investigated the bulk viscosity due to the non - leptonic weak process @xmath2 in @xmath1 condensed matter @xcite .",
    "the kaon bulk viscosity was suppressed in the condensed phase by several orders of magnitude and could not damp the r - mode instability .",
    "this motivates us to further investigate how the bulk viscosity due to the non - leptonic process @xmath0 behaves in antikaon condensed matter and how it influences r - modes of neutron stars .",
    "we organise the paper in the following way . in section 2 , the field",
    "theoretical models of strong interactions , different phases of dense matter , the bulk viscosity coefficient and the corresponding time scale are described .",
    "results of our calculation are discussed in section 3 .",
    "section 4 gives summary and conclusions .",
    "our motivation is to calculate the hyperon bulk viscosity due to the non - leptonic process @xmath0 in a superconducting phase i.e. antikaon condensed phase .",
    "this process was extensively investigated in hadronic matter by several groups @xcite . in this case",
    ", we consider a first order phase transition from hadronic to @xmath1 condensed matter .",
    "both the pure hadronic and @xmath1 condensed matter are described within the framework of relativistic field theoretical models .",
    "the constituents of matter in both phases are neutrons ( @xmath3 ) , protons ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath5 hyperons , electrons and muons .",
    "the baryon - baryon interaction is mediated by the exchange of @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 mesons and two strange mesons , scalar meson , @xmath9(975 ) ( denoted hereafter as @xmath10 ) and the vector meson @xmath11(1020 ) @xcite .",
    "both phases maintain local charge neutrality and beta - equilibrium conditions whereas these conditions are satisfied globally in the mixed phase .",
    "further baryons are embedded in the @xmath1 condensate phase .",
    "we describe the equation of state ( eos ) in the antikaon condensed phase using the following lagrangian density for baryons @xcite @xmath12 here @xmath13 denotes the dirac bispinor for baryons @xmath14 with vacuum mass @xmath15 and the isospin operator is @xmath16 .",
    "the scalar self - interaction term @xcite is @xmath17 the lagrangian density for hyperon - hyperon interaction ( @xmath18 ) is given by @xmath19 as nucleons do not couple with strange mesons , @xmath20 .",
    "similarly we treat the ( anti)kaon - baryon interaction in the same footing as the baryon - baryon interaction .",
    "the lagrangian density for ( anti)kaons in the minimal coupling scheme is @xcite , @xmath21 where the covariant derivative is @xmath22 and the effective mass of ( anti)kaons is @xmath23 .",
    "we perform this calculation in the mean field approximation @xcite .",
    "the mean meson fields in the condensed phase are denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath10 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the expressions for mean fields can be found in ref .",
    "the in - medium energy of @xmath1 mesons for @xmath27-wave ( @xmath28 ) condensation is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the chemical potential of @xmath1 mesons and the isospin projection is @xmath31 .",
    "the chemical potential for baryons @xmath14 is given by @xmath32 where effective baryon mass is @xmath33 and isospin projection for baryons @xmath14 is @xmath34 .",
    "we obtain the mean fields in the hadronic phase putting source terms for @xmath1 mesons equal to zero in corresponding equations of motion @xcite .",
    "the total energy density and pressure in the antikaon condensed phase are given by @xmath35 and @xmath36    we describe the mixed phase of hadronic and @xmath1 condensed matter using the gibbs conditions for thermodynamic equilibrium along with global charge and baryon number conservation laws @xcite .",
    "now we focus on the calculation of bulk viscosity due to the non - leptonic process .",
    "it was shown that the real part of bulk viscosity coefficient was related to relaxation times of microscopic processes @xcite by the relation , @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pressure , @xmath39 is the net microscopic relaxation time and @xmath40 and @xmath41 are infinite and zero frequency adiabatic indices respectively and their difference @xmath42 is determined using eos as input . here",
    "@xmath43 gives the neutron fraction in the equilibrium state and @xmath44 is the total baryon density .",
    "we are interested in ( l , m ) r - mode . in this case",
    ", the angular velocity ( @xmath7 ) of the mode is related to the angular velocity ( @xmath45 ) of a rotating neutron star as @xmath46 @xcite .",
    "the partial derivatives of pressure with respect to neutron fraction in both phases are calculated using the gibbs - duhem relation @xcite . in the pure hadronic phase",
    ", this relation gives @xmath47 where @xmath48 is defined by @xmath49 .",
    "similarly , in the pure condensed phase , it is given by @xmath50 in the mixed phase , this relation has the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "next we calculate relaxation times of the non - leptonic process in different phases . in this case , we express all perturbed quantities in terms of the variation in neutron number density ( @xmath53 ) in the respective phase . the relaxation time ( @xmath39 ) for the non - leptonic process",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath54 here , @xmath55 is the departure of neutron fraction from its thermodynamic equilibrium value @xmath56 in the j - th ( = hadron , @xmath1 condensed ) phase .",
    "the reaction rate per unit volume for the non - leptonic process in question was already calculated by others @xcite . the relaxation time ( @xmath39 ) for the process in the hadronic phase",
    "is given by @xcite @xmath57 along with @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fermi momentum for @xmath5 hyperons and @xmath60 is the angle averaged matrix element squared in the hadronic phase given by ref.@xcite . in pure hadronic phase , the second term in eq.(16 ) vanishes because @xmath61 .",
    "however , the calculation of the hadronic part of the mixed phase is a little bit involved and described below .",
    "the relaxation time in the antikaon condensed phase has the same form as in eq.(15 ) . in this case",
    ", the angle averaged matrix element , @xmath60 and @xmath59 are to be calculated in the condensed phase .",
    "also , we calculate @xmath62 from the chemical potential imbalance due to the non - leptonic hyperon process @xmath0 and it is given by , @xmath63 we express @xmath64 in terms of @xmath65 and obtain @xmath66 using the following constraints , @xmath67 and the chemical equilibrium in the strangeness changing process @xmath68 , @xmath69    next we calculate @xmath48 in the hadronic as well as @xmath1 condensed phases using the eos .",
    "we can write down these quantities for both phases in generalised forms .",
    "for @xmath70 , we get @xmath71 and for @xmath72 @xmath73 along with the following relations applicable for both cases @xmath74 @xmath75 where @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 here @xmath14 and @xmath79 denote baryons and p stands for hadron ( @xmath80 ) or antikaon ( @xmath81 ) phase .",
    "further nucleons do not couple with strange strange mesons i.e. @xmath82 .",
    "similarly , @xmath5 hyperons do not couple with @xmath8 meson i.e. @xmath83 .",
    "the results for other @xmath84s in the antikaon condensed phase are given below ,",

    ", we can now calculate relaxation time for the non - leptonic process in hadron as well as antikaon condensed phases .",
    "as soon as we know the relaxation time , we can calculate the bulk viscosity coefficient in each phase .",
    "now we focus on the calculation of relaxation time and bulk viscosity in the mixed phase . for this , we have to express the chemical imbalance ( @xmath64 ) in the non - leptonic hyperon process as given by eq.(17 ) in terms of @xmath65 from the following constraints , @xmath90 here we have @xmath91 because number densities deviate from their equilibrium values only by internal reactions @xcite .",
    "first two constraints follow from the conservation of baryon number and electric charge neutrality .",
    "the last constrain is the result of the chemical equilibrium involving @xmath1 condensate as already shown by eq.(19 ) .",
    "the other constraints are due to the equality of neutron , proton and @xmath5 chemical potentials in the hadronic and condensed phases and we can rewrite them as @xmath92 we express @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 in terms of @xmath99 using above six constraints . for this purpose , we solve a 6 @xmath100 6 matrix constructed out of above six relations and obtain @xmath62 .",
    "similarly , we obtain @xmath101 in the mixed phase from the above constraints . this completes the calculation of relaxation time and bulk viscosity in the mixed phase .",
    "next we calculate critical angular velocity as a function temperature and mass of a rotating neutron star .",
    "the bulk viscosity damping timescale ( @xmath102 ) due to the non - leptonic process involving @xmath5 hyperons and the bulk viscosity profile as a function of @xmath103 are obtained following the ref . @xcite .",
    "further we take into account time scales associated with gravitational radiation ( @xmath104 ) @xcite , bulk viscosity due to modified urca process ( @xmath105 ) involving only nucleons @xcite and the shear viscosity ( @xmath106 ) @xcite and define the overall r - mode time scale ( @xmath107 ) as @xmath108 finally , solving @xmath109 = 0 , we calculate the critical angular velocity above which the r - mode is unstable whereas it is stable below the critical angular velocity .",
    "for this calculation , nucleon - meson coupling constants are taken from ref.@xcite and this set is known as gm .",
    "nucleon - meson coupling constants are determined by reproducing nuclear matter saturation properties such as binding energy @xmath110 mev , baryon density @xmath111 @xmath112 , asymmetry energy coefficient @xmath113 mev , incompressibility @xmath114 mev and effective nucleon mass @xmath115 .",
    "further we need to know kaon - meson coupling constants and determine them using the quark model and isospin counting rule .",
    "the vector coupling constants are given by @xmath116 the scalar coupling constant is obtained from the real part of @xmath1 optical potential depth at normal nuclear matter density @xmath117 antikaons experience an attractive potential whereas kaons has a repulsive interaction in nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the analysis of @xmath1 atomic data using a hybrid model @xcite which combines the relativistic mean field approach in the nuclear interior and a phenomenological potential at low density , yielded the real part of the antikaon potential as large as @xmath118 mev at normal nuclear matter density .",
    "it was predicted that @xmath1 condensation might occur in neutron star matter for strongly attractive antikaon potential @xmath119 mev or more . in this calculation",
    ", we adopt the value of antikaon optical potential depth at normal nuclear matter density as @xmath120 mev .",
    "we obtain kaon - scalar meson coupling constant @xmath121 corresponding to this antikaon optical potential depth .    on the other hand ,",
    "hyperon - vector meson coupling constants are determined using su(6 ) symmetry of the quark model @xcite and the scalar @xmath6 meson coupling to @xmath5 hyperons is calculated from the hyperon potential depth in normal nuclear matter @xmath122 = @xmath123 mev obtained from hypernuclei data @xcite .",
    "the hyperon-@xmath10 coupling constant is determined from double @xmath5 hypernuclei data @xcite .",
    "the strange meson fields also couple with ( anti)kaons .",
    "the @xmath10-k coupling constant determined from the decay of @xmath9(925 ) is @xmath124 and the vector @xmath11 meson coupling with ( anti)kaons @xmath125 follows from the su(3 ) relation @xcite .",
    "the onsets of @xmath1 condensate and @xmath5 hyperons in neutron star matter are sensitive to the composition of matter and the strength of antikaon optical potential depth @xcite .",
    "it was further noted that the early appearance of either @xmath5 hyperons or the @xmath1 condensate delayed the onset of the other to higher densities . in this calculation , for @xmath126 mev , @xmath5 hyperons appear just after the onset of @xmath1 condensation .",
    "the @xmath1 condensation sets in at a density 2.23 @xmath127 and the mixed phase ends at 4.1 @xmath127 . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath5 hyperons appear at a density 2.51 @xmath127 .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that we obtained qualitatively similar results with the gm parameter set corresponding to @xmath128 mev and @xmath129 mev .",
    "however , this led to a soft eos resulting in a neutron star mass below the accurately measured mass @xcite .",
    "the composition of @xmath130-equilibrated and charge neutral matter in the presence of @xmath1 condensate for @xmath120 mev is displayed in figure 1 .",
    "negatively charged particles such as electrons and muons are depleted from the system with the onset of @xmath1 condensation and its rapid growth there after . at this stage , the proton density becomes equal to the density of @xmath1 mesons in the condensate .",
    "it is evident from the figure that @xmath5 hyperons populate the system just after the onset of @xmath1 condensation .",
    "the relaxation time for the non - leptonic process @xmath0 is plotted with normalised baryon density in figure 2 for @xmath120 mev and temperature @xmath131 k. here equations of state enter as inputs in the calculation of relaxation time in different phases . in particular ,",
    "partial derivatives of pressure and chemical potentials with respect to neutron number density are calculated using eos according to the prescription as discussed in section ii .",
    "this figure shows relaxation time in different phases i.e. the pure antikaon condensed phase ( light solid line ) and the hadronic ( bold solid line ) and antikaon condensed parts of the mixed phase ( dashed line ) .",
    "we find that the values of relaxation time in the pure and mixed antikaon condensed phases are significantly smaller than that of the hadronic phase involving non - superfluid @xmath5 hyperons @xcite .",
    "the relaxation time for the non - leptonic weak process involving hyperons is inversely proportional to @xmath132 as given by eq.(15 ) .",
    "figure 3 exhibits the hyperon bulk viscosity coefficient as a function of normalised baryon density at a temperature @xmath131 k. similar to fig .",
    "2 , the bulk viscosity in the pure antikaon condensed phase ( light solid line ) and the hadronic ( bold solid line ) and antikaon condensed parts of the mixed phase ( dashed line ) are shown here .",
    "one can immediately see that the hyperon bulk viscosity in the antikaon condensed matter , irrespective of whether it is in the pure or mixed phase , is suppressed compared with that of hadronic phase .",
    "this suppression may be attributed to the superconducting phase i.e the @xmath1 condensed phase .",
    "the role of superfluidity on hyperon bulk viscosity was studied at length by several groups @xcite .",
    "they also obtained significant suppression in the hyperon bulk viscosity because one or more superfluid particles were participating in non - leptonic weak processes involving hyperons . in our calculation ,",
    "@xmath1 mesons in the bose - einstein condensed state is not a member of the non - leptonic weak process @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the suppression of hyperon bulk viscosity in our case originates from the eos in the @xmath1 condensed phase which enters into the calculation of the chemical imbalance as given by eq.(17 ) .",
    "we further add that the factor @xmath133 in the bulk viscosity coefficient given by eq.(15 ) is negligible compared with unity over the whole range of baryon densities considered here .",
    "this leads to a @xmath134 temperature dependence of the hyperon bulk viscosity .",
    "however , the inversion of the temperature dependence was observed in some calculations @xcite when the factor @xmath133 is much greater than unity .",
    "we find a jump in the bulk viscosity coefficient at the upper phase boundary of the mixed phase and pure @xmath1 condensed phase .",
    "this is attributed to kinks in the eos and discontinuities in ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "now we discuss the results of damping time scale due to the hyperon bulk viscosity and critical angular velocity .",
    "this calculation needs the knowledge of the energy density profile , hyperon bulk viscosity profile and the structure of the rotating neutron star in question . for this purpose",
    ", we consider a neutron star of gravitational mass 1.60@xmath136 having baryon rest mass 1.76@xmath136 and central baryon density 3.50 @xmath127 and rotating at an angular velocity @xmath137 from the sequence of rotating neutron stars calculated by the model of stergioulas @xcite .",
    "this neutron star contains both @xmath5 hyperons and @xmath1 condensate in its core as its central baryon density is well above the threshold densities of @xmath1 condensation and @xmath5 hyperons .",
    "the hyperon bulk viscosity profile of this neutron star as a function of equatorial distance for @xmath131 k is displayed in figure 4 .",
    "the hyperon bulk viscosity in the hadronic and antikaon condensed parts of the mixed phase are shown by bold solid and dashed lines , respectively .",
    "further we note that the bulk viscosity profile drops to zero value beyond 3.5 km because the baryon density beyond this distance decreases below the threshold density of @xmath5 hyperons .",
    "as soon as we know the energy density and bulk viscosity profiles , we obtain the damping time scale corresponding to the hyperon bulk viscosity and critical angular velocities as a function of temperature solving @xmath138 for a rotating neutron star mass 1.60@xmath136 . besides the hyperon bulk viscosity",
    ", we also consider the bulk viscosity due to modified urca process involving nucleons as well as the shear viscosity to the total r - mode time scale as given by eq.(34 ) .",
    "the bulk viscosity due to modified urca process plays an important role to damp the r - mode at higher temperatures .",
    "however , this process can not suppress the r - mode instability below @xmath139 k because the corresponding damping time scale is longer than the gravitational radiation growth time scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the shear viscosity coefficient is proportional to @xmath140 and the damping time scale @xmath106 is also larger than @xmath104 in the temperature range considered here .",
    "the bulk viscosity damping time scale ( @xmath102 ) due to the non - leptonic process @xmath0 and @xmath104 are comparable at t @xmath141 and below .",
    "consequently , the r - mode instability is damped in this temperature regime by the hyperon bulk viscosity in @xmath1 condensed matter .",
    "though the hyperon bulk viscosity is suppressed in the antikaon condensed phase , it is still a very efficient process to damp the r - mode instability .",
    "we have investigated the hyperon bulk viscosity due to the non - leptonic weak process @xmath0 in a @xmath1 condensed phase and later applied it to study the r - mode instability in neutron stars . for",
    "the parameter set adopted here and antikaon optical potential depth @xmath120 mev , @xmath1 condensation occurs before @xmath5 hyperons are populated in the system .",
    "we find that the hyperon bulk viscosity coefficient in @xmath1 condensed matter is significantly suppressed compared with the non - superfluid hyperon bulk viscosity coefficient in the hadronic phase .",
    "further we note that the hyperon bulk viscosity in the superconducting phase is still an efficient process to damp the r - mode instability .",
