    "a possible existence of a tribaryon state with strangeness @xmath8 and isospin 0 has been predicted theoretically by akaishi and yamazaki as a deeply - bound @xmath9 nuclear state in @xmath10he nuclei @xcite .",
    "recently , the kek - ps e471 group reported a distinct peak in a missing mass spectrum of the @xmath0he(@xmath11 reaction @xcite , which was interpreted to be a signal of a tribaryon state with strangeness @xmath21 and isospin 1 , called s@xmath12 ( m = 3117.0@xmath13 mev/@xmath3 and @xmath14 21 mev/@xmath3 ) .",
    "the same group obtained another candidate of the tribaryon state , s@xmath15(3140 ) , in the @xmath0he(@xmath16 missing mass spectrum , but its statistical significance was not sufficient to claim a definitive evidence for its existence @xcite .",
    "these results have triggered many theoretical interpretations @xcite . meanwhile the finuda group observed a peak in the proton momentum spectrum of @xmath17li(@xmath18 ) @xcite .",
    "they attributed the peak to the proton emission from the @xmath19 capture on a `` quasi '' deuteron in @xmath17li as , @xmath20 ( @xmath21 mev/@xmath22 ) , which was introduced as an interpretation of s@xmath23(3115 ) by ref .",
    "@xcite , and they claimed that the peak structures observed in e471 and finuda should be of the same nature .",
    "counter arguments to this interpretation followed @xcite .",
    "therefore , the confirmation and further study of these states were strongly awaited .",
    "this situation has lead us to carry out a new experimental search with improved resolution and higher statistics based on the e471 experimental setup .",
    "the reaction we adopted is @xmath0he(@xmath24 ) , the same as in e471 ; @xmath25 where the state with isospin 1 and charge 0 ( s@xmath23 ) is populated in the proton emission reaction and the state with isospin 1 and 0 and charge @xmath261 ( s@xmath27 ) state in the neutron emission reaction .",
    "the state originally predicted by akaishi and yamazaki has be searched for using neutron spectroscopy .",
    "the objectives of the proton spectroscopy are , first , to confirm s@xmath12 and determine its width and formation ratio with improved resolution by an inclusive measurement . since the experimental setup of e471",
    "was originally designed to be optimized for the neutron tof measurement , the experimental resolution for protons was not satisfactory .",
    "moreover , the limited momentum acceptance for protons made the search for excited states of s@xmath28 difficult .",
    "thus , the second objective of the present experiment is to search for other candidates for tribaryon states , including excited states of s@xmath12 .    in this letter",
    ", we give the first report , namely , on experimental results on the missing mass analysis of the @xmath0he(@xmath29 ) reaction , and results on the neutron measurement will be given in a paper to follow .",
    "the experiment ( called `` e549 '' ) was performed at the k5 beamline of the kek 12 gev proton synchrotron .",
    "the experimental setup is schematically illustrated in fig .",
    "[ setup ] together with a detailed view around the target in the inset . a @xmath19 beam with momentum 650 mev/@xmath22 was stopped inside a super - fluid helium-4 target ( 20 cm in diameter , 15 cm long at a density of 0.145 g / cm@xmath10 ) .",
    "we determined the energy of protons emitted from the @xmath19 absorption reaction by means of the time - of - flight ( tof ) method .",
    "the experimental apparatus was based on that of the former experiment e471 , and its description can be found in ref @xcite .",
    "since the setup of e471 was optimized for neutron spectroscopy , considerable improvements have been made to achieve better energy resolution for the proton tof measurement .    in e549 ,",
    "tof detectors dedicated for the proton measurement were installed .",
    "they consist of a tracking drift chamber ( pdc ) and a set of tof start / stop counters ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , which are plastic scintillator walls with 8 and 17 segments , respectively .",
    "the missing mass resolution was expected to be twice that of e471 thanks to the precise determination of the tof and the flight path . beside this , the @xmath0he(@xmath29 ) data were taken inclusively , whereas the proton data in e471 were measured in coincidence with secondary charged particles ( `` semi - inclusive '' ) .",
    "the present inclusive measurement enables us to determine the formation ratio of the state precisely .",
    "together with the beam timing counter ( t0 ) , @xmath31 also gives us information on the reaction timing which is defined by the time difference between the stopped kaon and outgoing charged particles .",
    "furthermore , we extended the momentum acceptance for the proton to perform the experimental search with a wider missing mass region than in e471 .",
    "this became possible by minimizing the amount of material between the target and @xmath32 .",
    "data were taken for a month from the end of may , 2005 , and the accumulated data correspond to ( 1.03 @xmath33 0.15 ) @xmath34 stopped @xmath19 inside the target .",
    "there is a well - known fact that a few percent of stopped @xmath19 s in liquid helium form long - lived atomic states with large angular momenta .",
    "these `` _ metastable _ '' kaonic he atoms were directly observed in a time spectrum by a past kek experiment with @xmath19 absorption on @xmath0he @xcite . since the partial lifetime of this state ( @xmath35=59@xmath334 ns@xcite ) is much longer than the kaon lifetime , most kaons in this state decay at - rest without nuclear absorption .",
    "a monochromatic muon associated with a two body decay of stopped @xmath19 ( @xmath36 , called @xmath37 ) was used for determining the timing resolution of the present tof system and its long - term stability throughout the experiment .",
    "the yield of @xmath38 was also used for the normalization of the missing mass spectrum as described later .",
    "these decay components , especially @xmath37 , can be clearly identified by applying the timing analysis between the stopped kaons and the outgoing muons .",
    "this is because the lifetime of a kaon in the metastable atomic state together with the kaon decay lifetime ( @xmath39 ns @xcite ) is much longer than the typical hyperon lifetimes which are of the order of 100 ps .",
    "thus , by selecting the delayed timing events , we can drastically suppress the events from the prompt nuclear absorption and successive hyperon decays .",
    "figure [ meta ] shows the inverse velocity ( 1/@xmath40 ) spectrum of secondary charged particles from the @xmath0he(@xmath41 ) reaction with delayed timing selection ( @xmath42 ns ) .",
    "we can clearly see three peaks at @xmath43 .",
    "they correspond to electrons ( mainly @xmath44 ) , muons ( @xmath38 ) and pions ( @xmath45 ) , respectively .",
    "we estimated the tof resolution from the width of the @xmath37 muons , and found it to be 0.020 ( @xmath46 ) after fitting the spectrum with three gaussians and a second - order polynomial function .",
    "this value is equivalent to that obtained from @xmath47 events in the stopped @xmath48 calibration data .",
    "spectrum from the @xmath0he(@xmath49 , @xmath50 ) reaction with the delayed event selection .",
    "the spectrum was fitted by a three gaussian and a second - order polynomial function .",
    "fitting results are overlaid by dotted lines . ]      protons from the @xmath0he(@xmath41 ) reaction were clearly identified by the correlation between 1/@xmath40 and the total light output in p@xmath51 and nc .",
    "figure [ pid ] shows the criteria for proton selection .",
    "this selection method is essentially the same as that of e471 , but we can detect slower protons , i.e. a higher missing mass region , thanks to the extension of the momentum acceptance ( see fig . 2 in ref .",
    "the contamination due to reacted pions was estimated to be about 5 % of protons in the present proton selection .     and the total light output in @xmath32 and nc in units of mev@xmath52 ( mev electron equivalent ) .",
    "the two lines in the figure define the proton region . ]",
    "figure [ mom ] shows the obtained momentum distribution under the inclusive condition . in the figure , a correction for the energy loss between the reaction vertex and the tof counters was applied .",
    "the overall spectrum shape is understood well by the two nucleon absorption reaction , @xmath53 , for the higher momentum side and quasi - free hyperon production and its decay , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , for the lower one .",
    "the upper figure shows the geometrical acceptance of protons , which was obtained by a monte carlo simulation using the geant 4 package taking into account the realistic stopped @xmath19 distribution and the e549 setup .",
    "the vertical line in the figure shows the lower acceptance limit in e471 .",
    "the present sensitive region was extended below 415 mev/@xmath22 .",
    "as shown in the figure , there is no distinct peak . in the following sections",
    ", we will determine the upper limit of the formation branching ratio for a tribaryon state .",
    "he@xmath56 reaction .",
    "the upper figure represents the geometrical acceptance for protons as a function of the proton momentum .",
    "the vertical line in the figure shows the acceptance limit of e471 . ]",
    "the proton counts in the missing mass spectrum were normalized by the number of stopped @xmath19 .",
    "for the normalization , we used the metastable state described above , because the fraction of free decays , @xmath57 , of stopped @xmath19 on @xmath0he was measured to be 3.5 @xmath33 0.5 % /(@xmath7 ) in ref .",
    "the proton yield , @xmath58 , is given as @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the number of counts of the @xmath37 muons and protons respectively , @xmath62 is the branching ratio of the @xmath37 decay , @xmath63 is the reduction factor resulting from the delayed timing gate , i.e. @xmath64 , and @xmath65 and @xmath66 are detection efficiencies of muons and protons respectively .",
    "figure [ mass ] shows the normalized missing mass spectrum obtained from the inclusive @xmath0he@xmath56 reaction together with the proton momentum scale and energy thresholds of the @xmath67 and @xmath68 . the ordinate unit shows the proton yield per stopped @xmath19 , and the systematic error of the ordinate corresponds to 14 % in the relative error , which is dominated by the error of @xmath57 .",
    "an inset in the figure is the close - up view of the lower mass region .",
    "the upper figure in fig [ mass ] shows the missing mass resolution as a function of the missing mass .",
    "it was derived from a monte carlo simulation with an assumption that the tof resolution of protons is equivalent to that of @xmath37 muons .",
    "this resolution is about twice better than that of ref .",
    "this was used in a spectral fitting for the determination of upper limits described in the following section .",
    "he@xmath56 reaction by the inclusive measurement .",
    "the abscissa is the missing mass and the ordinate is the proton yield normalized by the number of stopped kaons .",
    "the systematic error of the ordinate contains a 14 percent relative error .",
    "the upper figure shows the overall missing mass resolution in the present experiment . ]      for quantifying the search results , we derived upper limits for the formation branching ratio of a tribaryon state .",
    "they were obtained by fitting the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ mass ] with an assumed peak and a smooth background function .",
    "the fitting procedure is as follows ;    * the fitting function was set to be a voigtian ( convolution of gaussian and lorentzian ) as a peak and a polynomial function as a background .",
    "the yield of the state was determined by the area of the lorentzian .",
    "the natural width and center of the peak were fixed for each fitting .",
    "the standard deviation of the gaussian was set to be the experimental resolution taking the mass dependence into account as shown in fig .",
    "* since the background shape can not be fully reproduced by a monte carlo simulation , we assume that the background can be expressed as a smooth function within the fit region .",
    "* we tested three fit regions  determined by the width of the peak function to be ( @xmath69 hwhm ( @xmath70 ) ) .",
    "conservative upper limits were determined using the highest value of the results from each fit region .",
    "we used this fit method with widths of 0 , 20 and 40 mev/@xmath3 by changing the mass from 3000 to 3200 mev/@xmath3 .",
    "systematic errors , mainly dominated by an uncertainty in @xmath57 , were taken into account in the total error of the peak intensity by summing quadratically the systematic error and fitting error ( @xmath71 ) . in the fitting",
    ", the yield of the state sometimes results in an unphysical value , namely , a negative lorentzian area . in that case",
    ", we followed a prescription of _ `` unified approach '' _ assuming gaussian statistics @xcite .",
    "the upper limit on the formation branching ratio at 95 % confidence level was obtained using the table x in ref .",
    "@xcite with the resultant peak yield and the total error .",
    "figure [ ul ] shows a plot of the upper limits versus the missing mass for widths of the assumed states of 0 , 20 and 40 mev/@xmath3 .",
    "the present procedure gives a higher upper limit especially for the state with a larger width .",
    "thus , it must be emphasized that the present procedure using the inclusive proton spectrum only is insensitive for a broad peak structure , which will be investigated with exclusive measurements .",
    "the present upper limit of the formation branching ratio at the mass of 3115 mev/@xmath3 , where the e471 group observed s@xmath12 , is @xmath720.2 % /(@xmath73 ) with the width of @xmath74 = 20 mev/@xmath3 .",
    "although the trigger condition was different , the e471 group reported a formation branching ratio of about 1 % /(@xmath73 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , which can be excluded by more than a 95 % confidence level .",
    "we studied the reason for this discrepancy and found as a most likely cause for a fake peak formation , an erroneous slewing correction of the proton time of flight spectrum for the large proton signals compared to those of well calibrated minimum ionizing particles @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the inclusive proton momentum spectrum from @xmath0he(@xmath49 , @xmath75 ) has no structure whereas the finuda group found a peak in the proton momentum spectrum for @xmath17li(@xmath49 , @xmath75 ) .",
    "there is a controversial discussion concerning the production of monochromatic proton by antikaon absorption on low momentum deuteron clusters in nuclei @xcite . in the case of @xmath17li ,",
    "the peak observed in the finuda spectrum may be attributed to such a process , however , it is obvious that the monochromatic process does not occur in the @xmath76he absorption case at the level of @xmath77 .",
    "= 0 , 20 and 40 mev/@xmath3 states , respectively . ]",
    "in conclusion , we have searched for neutral tribaryon states with strangeness @xmath21 and isospin 1 by missing - mass analysis of the inclusive @xmath0he@xmath56 reaction .",
    "quite high statistics for protons ( more than one million ) was accumulated in the momentum range of 300  700 mev/@xmath22 .",
    "no significant narrow structure was observed .",
    "the upper limits for the formation branching ratio in the mass range 3000 @xmath78 m @xmath78 3200 mev/@xmath3 with an assumed width of 0 , 20 and 40 mev/@xmath3 were determined to be approximately @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81/(@xmath7 ) , respectively , with a 95 % confidence level .",
    "this result clearly indicates that a large formation ratio ( order of 1 % /(@xmath73 ) ) of a narrow tribaryon state , such as s@xmath12 is excluded .",
