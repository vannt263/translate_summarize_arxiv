    "gamma - ray burst ( grb ) is known as one of the most energetic stellar explosions in the universe . at present , the _ swift _ satellite @xcite , a nasa mission dedicated to monitor this phenomenon , carries three instruments with separate wave bands : burst alert telescope ( bat ; @xmath0  kev ) , x - ray telescope ( xrt ; @xmath1  kev ) and ultraviolet / optical telescope ( uvot ) .",
    "bat is able to catch about 100 grbs per year , and xrt is able to follow them rapidly in the x - ray band and pinpoint their positions accurately .",
    "however , uvot could only detect the optical afterglows in about @xmath2 of them .",
    "some of the detected optical afterglows are also weaker than those predicted by theoretical models .",
    "those that have weaker or no optical afterglow are called optically dark grbs @xcite .",
    "the origin of dark grbs is an open question in the research field of grbs .",
    "generally , the extinction by ambient dust grains is considered as the answer @xcite , but the detailed theoretical implications are uncertain .",
    "the extinction curves measured for grb afterglows are very diverse .",
    "some of them are similar to that of the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) , i.e. , a steep extinction curve ; some of them are similar to that of the milky way ( mw ) , i.e. , an extinction curve with significant extinction bump at @xmath3 @xcite ; some of them are similar to that of a normal active galaxy with a flat extinction curve , i.e. , gray extinction @xcite . obviously , the various extinction properties can not be fitted with the modeling sample of existing extinction curves .",
    "it is still a mystery how to infer the physical implications with different extinction curves . in this work",
    ", we adopt the latest algorithm for calculating dust physics and focus on the effect of dust extinction on grb afterglows . by analyzing the influences of different physical parameters of dust grains on the extinction curves",
    ", we can reproduce various observed extinction curves and provide theoretical basis for the studies of dark grbs and gray extinction .",
    "considering a spherical dust grain with radius @xmath4 and complex refractive index @xmath5 , and based on mie theory @xcite , the extinction cross - section for the incident light with wavelength @xmath6 is @xmath7 the scattering cross - section is @xmath8 and the absorption cross - section is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 , and the scattering coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath12 are @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the dimensionless size parameter , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are riccati - bessel functions .",
    "methods for numerical calculations based on mie theory are mature now .",
    "owing to the rapid development of computer science , the calculation of the infinite sums can be performed on popular pcs at present , instead of using supercomputers in the past .",
    "numerical analyses indicate that the infinite series summation in equations  ( 1)-(4 ) can be approximated by the first @xmath18 terms with a sufficiently high precision @xcite , where @xmath19 is the dimensionless size parameter mentioned above .",
    "currently , there are a few popular fortran codes @xcite , which can be very efficient ( for a single calculation with @xmath20 , it only takes a couple of seconds on an intel pc with a main frequency of 2.6 ghz ) , but is also numerically unstable and can be very time - consuming for multi - wavelength calculations , due to the lack of real - time adjustment of the precision , especially when @xmath19 is very large ( for x - rays and large dust grains , @xmath21 ) . for the evaluation of absorption and scattering cross - sections over a broad bandpass and a wide size range of dust grains ,",
    "multiple analytical approximations are usually adopted for interpolation @xcite . in order to study the properties of x - ray scattering and absorption by large dust grains",
    ", we make an extensive use of the latest miesold code in the advanced language mathematica which can make real - time adjustment of the precision with a sacrifice of the speed ( for a single calculation with @xmath22 , it takes about @xmath23 on an intel pc with a main frequency of 2.6 ghz ) .",
    "nevertheless , the precision is greatly improved by self - adapting calculations over a much larger parameter space .",
    "there are a variety of substances in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the composition and optical properties of most dust grains can not be obtained directly by experiment or observation .",
    "they are mainly measured jointly by laboratory experiments , theoretical modelings and astronomical observations . at present ,",
    "silicate and graphite are known as the two most important ingredients in ism @xcite .",
    "their optical properties have been systematically studied by draine and his colleagues and the latest results on their complex refractive indices @xmath5 have been summarized in figure  1 @xcite .",
    "the optical properties of graphite are highly anisotropic , and the value of @xmath5 is dependent on the angle included between the direction of electric field and the crystal axis .",
    "the `` @xmath24 '' approximation is usually adopted in most evaluations , i.e. , graphite is assumed as a mixture of two types of isotropic substances . among them , @xmath25 constituent resembles the graphite with the electric field parallel to the crystal axis and @xmath26 constituent resembles the graphite with the electric field perpendicular to the crystal axis @xcite . the x - ray edge absorption is taken into account in the results shown in figure  1 ( see @xmath27 , the imaginary part of @xmath5 ) .",
    "the edge absorptions of silicate are quite abundant , including the multiple edge absorptions from mg , fe , si and o , while graphite has only a k edge absorption between 282 and 310 ev @xcite .",
    "based on the above - mentioned optical properties of silicate and graphite , we can obtain their absorption and scattering cross - sections as functions of the grain size @xmath4 and the energy of the incident light @xmath28 by precise evaluations according to mie theory . as shown in figure  2 ,",
    "the results given by the miesolid code ( rigorous mie ) are very consistent with those previously combined results based on multiple analytical approximations ( mie , rayleigh - gans [ rg ] and geometric optics [ go ] ) and have higher spectral resolution with better performance on the edge absorptions .",
    "the only flaw is that it is unstable in the ultraviolet and soft x - ray band when the grain size is larger than @xmath29 , which shall be tackled in the future code debugging . in this work ,",
    "we adopt the existing approximative results for the unstable region via interpolation which will have negligible effect on the final results , since large grains in most standard dust models are deficient .",
    "our results ( as in figure  2 ) indicate that , when the typical grain size is small ( @xmath30 ) absorption dominates the extinction with most of the incident energy transformed into ambient thermal energy . in this case",
    ", the scattering will be relatively weak , and it has been overlooked in previous works . on the contrary , when the typical grain size is large ( @xmath31 ) , the scattering dominates the extinction , especially the x - ray scattering will play an important role .",
    "as the grain is getting larger , the scattering is more effective .",

    "meanwhile , the extinction optical depth can be given by @xmath48 and the extinction magnitude is @xmath49 .",
    "the grb afterglows that are emitted by the shock - accelerated electrons in the relativistic outflow usually exhibit a power - law spectrum from the optical to x - ray band , which hereafter is assumed to be @xmath50 ( as shown by the gray solid line in figure  3 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the column density of hydrogen atoms is the principal quantity that dominates the extinction from ultraviolet to soft x - ray band .",

    ", width=384 ]    besides the column density of hydrogen atoms , many other factors will also affect the extinction curve ( including the absolute amount of extinction and the profile of the extinction curve ) .",
    "herein we mainly consider some key physical quantities : the ratio of silicate and graphite @xmath47 , the metallicity @xmath46 , parameters for dust grain size distribution @xmath41 and @xmath60 .",
    "the impact of @xmath47 on the extinction curve is shown in figure  4 , where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are represented by the solid , dotted , short - dashed and long - dashed lines , respectively .",

    "being similar to the column density of hydrogen atom @xmath58 , which dominates the absolute amount of extinction , larger metallicity causes stronger extinction . as shown in figure  5 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "are represented by the solid , dotted , short - dashed and long - dashed lines , respectively .",
    "the other parameters also have their respective typical values , i.e. , @xmath73 , @xmath66 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath74 . the ambient environment around a grb is very complicated .",
    "there might be a high metallicity if the explosion occurs in the latter phase of the massive progenitor star which is an ideal place for the dust formation",
    ". this might be the leading cause of the severe extinction and the optically dark grbs .",
    "obviously , as the computing results indicate , the power - law index of the dust grain size distribution @xmath41 mainly determines the profile of the extinction curve .",
    "the chief reason is that dust grains with different sizes have different contributions to the extinction at different photon frequencies .",
    "this is governed by the physics of dust scattering , which is weakly affected by the ingredients of dust grains . as shown in figure  6 ,",

    "another interesting feature is that @xmath41 barely affects the optical extinction @xmath78 .",
    "this may explain why we can usually observe different extinction curves from grb afterglows , but @xmath78 is barely correlated with @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "our computing results indicate that difference of size distribution of dust grains might be the internal cause .",
    "the upper limit for the size distribution of dust grains @xmath79 is also an important parameter that determines the absolute amount of extinction .",
    "being different from the above - mentioned column density of hydrogen atom @xmath40 and the metallicity @xmath46 , as @xmath60 increases , the absolute amount of extinction decreases .",

    "this phenomenon is due to an underlying assumption in our calculations that the total mass of the dust grains is conserved .",
    "larger dust grains are formed by the aggregation of smaller ones . as the number of larger dust grains increase , the total number density of the dust grains will naturally decrease .",
    "our computing results indicate that the absolute amount of extinction will remarkably decrease , and as the size of dust grain increases , the extinction curve will become flatter , causing gray extinction @xcite .",
    "therefore , with @xmath41 and @xmath60 both varying , we would expect that the dust grains with typically larger sizes will cause weak extinction and have a flatter extinction curve , i.e. , causing gray extinction .",
    "this explains why most observed optically bright afterglows exhibit flat extinction curves @xcite . on the contrary , the dust grains with typically smaller sizes would cause more severe extinction , i.e. , causing optically dark bursts , and have remarkably steeper extinction curves .",

    "in this work , in order to study the effect of dust extinction on grb afterglows , we carry out numerical calculations based on dust physics and explore the effects of various dust parameters on the extinction curves .",
    "we find that the medium density and the metallicity determine the absolute amount of extinction , and the parameters for the size distribution of dust grains @xmath41 and @xmath85 determine the profile of the extinction curve .",

    "when @xmath41 is smaller or @xmath85 is smaller , i.e. , smaller grains are more excessive , the extinction curve will be steeper with severe extinction , most likely causing the optical dark bursts .",
    "this may also explain why most bright afterglows tend to have flatter extinction curves .",
    "therefore , the massive stellar birth of the grb and its complex progenitor environment , should be the major cause of origin of the optical dark bursts and diverse optical afterglows .",
