    "magnons are the collective excitations of ordered quantum magnets such as ferromagnets or antiferromagnets . in quantum magnetic systems that lack inversion symmetry , the dmi ( spin - orbit coupling)@xcite is present and leads to chiral magnons with nontrivial topological properties @xcite similar to electronic systems @xcite . as magnons are uncharged ( neutral ) quasiparticles , they do not experience a magnetic field in the lorentz force as in the electronic version of hall effect .",

    "this means that the integrated berry curvature vanishes identically for each band , hence thermal hall effect is not expected to manifest in this system without the dmi . for the bilayer model @xmath224 , the analysis follows a similar procedure . in the hp boson representation ,",

    "<S> motivated by the fact that many bilayer quantum magnets occur in nature , we generalize the study of thermal hall transports of spin excitations to bilayer magnetic systems . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that bilayer magnetic systems can be coupled either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically . </S>",
    "<S> we study both scenarios on the honeycomb lattice and show that the system realizes topologically nontrivial magnon bands induced by alternating next - nearest - neighbour dzyaloshinsky - moriya interaction ( dmi ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the bilayer system realizes both magnon hall effect and magnon spin nernst effect . </S>",
    "<S> we show that antiferromagnetically coupled layers differ from ferromagnetically coupled layers by a sign change in the conductivities as the magnetic field is reversed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , chern number protected magnon edge states are observed and propagate in the same direction on the top and bottom layers in ferromagnetically coupled layers , whereas the magnon edge states propagate in opposite directions for antiferromagnetically coupled layers . </S>"
