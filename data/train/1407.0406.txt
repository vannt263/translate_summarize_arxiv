    "polynomial interpretations are a simple yet useful technique for proving termination of term rewrite systems ( trss , for short ) .",
    "while originally conceived in the late seventies by lankford @xcite as a means for establishing direct termination proofs , polynomial interpretations are nowadays often used in the context of the dependency pair ( dp ) framework @xcite . in the classical approach of lankford ,",
    "one considers polynomials with integer coefficients inducing polynomial algebras over the well - founded domain of the natural numbers . to be precise",
    ", every @xmath0-ary function symbol @xmath1 is interpreted by a polynomial @xmath2 in @xmath0 indeterminates with integer coefficients , which induces a mapping or _ interpretation _ from terms to integer numbers in the obvious way . in order to conclude termination of a given trs",
    ", three conditions have to be satisfied .",
    "first , every polynomial must be _ well - defined _",
    ", i.e. , it must induce a well - defined polynomial function @xmath3 over the natural numbers .",
    "in addition , the interpretation functions @xmath4 are required to be _ strictly monotone _ in all arguments . finally , one has to show _ compatibility _ of the interpretation with the given trs .",
    "more precisely , for every rewrite rule @xmath5 , the polynomial @xmath6 associated with the left - hand side must be greater than @xmath7 , the corresponding polynomial of the right - hand side , i.e. , @xmath8 for all values of the indeterminates .    already back in the seventies , an alternative approach using polynomials with real coefficients instead of integers was proposed by dershowitz  @xcite .",
    "however , as the real numbers @xmath9 equipped with the standard order @xmath10 are not well - founded , a subterm property is explicitly required to ensure well - foundedness .",
    "it was not until 2005 that this limitation was overcome , when lucas @xcite presented a framework for proving polynomial termination over the real numbers , where well - foundedness is basically achieved by replacing @xmath10 with a new ordering @xmath11 requiring comparisons between terms to not be below a given positive real number @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , this framework also facilitates polynomial interpretations over the rational numbers .",
    "thus , one can distinguish three variants of polynomial interpretations , polynomial interpretations with real , rational and integer coefficients , and the obvious question is : what is their relationship with regard to termination proving power ? for knuth - bendix orders it is known  @xcite that extending the range of the underlying weight function from natural numbers to non - negative reals does not result in an increase in termination proving power . in 2006",
    "lucas  @xcite proved that there are trss that can be shown polynomially terminating by polynomial interpretations with rational coefficients , but can not be shown polynomially terminating using polynomials with integer coefficients only .",
    "likewise , he proved that there are trss that can be handled by polynomial interpretations with real ( algebraic ) coefficients , but can not be handled by polynomial interpretations with rational coefficients .    in this article",

    "in particular , the constraint @xmath397 associated with @xmath398 holds for all @xmath342 .",
    "removing the rules from @xmath395 for which ( strict ) compatibility holds leaves us with the rules , and @xmath398 , which are easily handled , e.g.  by the linear interpretation @xmath399    [ lem : trs_r_6 ] the trs @xmath395 is not incrementally polynomially terminating over @xmath9 or @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath119 , and let @xmath369 be a polynomial interpretation over @xmath129 that is weakly compatible with @xmath395 , and in which the interpretation of the function symbol @xmath211 has the shape @xmath400 with @xmath104 .",
    "then the weak compatibility constraint @xmath401 associated with @xmath398 does not hold for all @xmath402 because the polynomial @xmath403 is negative in the open interval @xmath404 . as the above assumption on the interpretation of @xmath211 follows from lemma  [ lem : trs_s ]",
    "if @xmath369 is strictly monotone , we conclude that there is no strictly monotone polynomial interpretation over @xmath9 or @xmath14 that is weakly compatible with the trs @xmath395 .",
    "this implies that @xmath395 is not incrementally polynomially terminating over @xmath9 or @xmath14 .",
    "together , lemma  [ lem : trs_r_6_sn ] and lemma  [ lem : trs_r_6 ] yield the main result of this subsection .    [ cor : nvsr_inc ] there are trss that are incrementally polynomially terminating over @xmath15 but not over @xmath9 or @xmath14 .",
    "the results presented in this section can be summarized by stating that the relationships expressed in figure  [ fig : summary ] remain true for incremental polynomial termination , after replacing @xmath20 by @xmath395 and @xmath21 by @xmath361 .",
    "in this article , we investigated the relationship of polynomial interpretations with real , rational and integer coefficients with respect to termination proving power .",
    "in particular , we presented three new results , the first of which shows that polynomial interpretations over the reals subsume polynomial interpretations over the rationals , the second of which shows that polynomial interpretations over the reals or rationals do not properly subsume polynomial interpretations over the integers , a result that comes somewhat unexpected , and the third of which shows that there are trss that can be proved terminating by polynomial interpretations over the naturals or the reals but not over the rationals .",
    "these results were extended to incremental termination proofs . in  @xcite it",
    "is shown how to adapt the results to the dependency pair framework  @xcite .",
    "we conclude this article by reviewing our results in the context of automated termination analysis , where linear polynomial interpretations , i.e. , polynomial interpretations with all interpretation functions being linear , play an important role .",
    "this naturally raises the question as to what extent the restriction to linear polynomial interpretations influences the hierarchy depicted in figure  [ fig : summary ] , and in what follows we shall see that it changes considerably .",
    "more precisely , the areas inhabited by the trss @xmath20 and @xmath21 become empty , such that polynomial termination by a linear polynomial interpretation over @xmath15 implies polynomial termination by a linear polynomial interpretation over @xmath14 , which in turn implies polynomial termination by a linear polynomial interpretation over @xmath9 .",
    "the latter follows directly from theorem  [ thm : qvsr ] and remark  [ rem : qvsr ] , whereas the former is shown below .",
    "polynomial termination by a linear polynomial interpretation over @xmath15 implies polynomial termination by a linear polynomial interpretation over @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath86 be a trs that is compatible with a linear polynomial interpretation @xmath164 over @xmath15 , where every @xmath0-ary function symbol  @xmath211 is associated with a linear polynomial @xmath405 .",
    "we show that the same interpretation also establishes polynomial termination over @xmath14 with the value of @xmath12 set to one . to this end",
    ", we note that in order to guarantee strict monotonicity and well - definedness over @xmath15 , the coefficients of the respective interpretation functions have to satisfy the following conditions : @xmath406 and @xmath407 for all @xmath408 .",
    "hence , by lemma  [ lem : qlinmon ] , we also have well - definedness over @xmath113 and strict monotonicity with respect to the order @xmath409 .",
    "( strict monotonicity also follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2 ) . ) moreover , as @xmath86 is compatible with @xmath164 , each rewrite rule @xmath89 satisfies @xmath410 where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) denotes the polynomial associated with @xmath171 ( @xmath172 ) and the variables @xmath173 are those occurring in @xmath5 . since linear functions are closed under composition , the polynomial @xmath411 is a linear polynomial @xmath412 , such that holds if and only if @xmath413 and @xmath414 for all @xmath415 .",
    "however , then we also have @xmath416 which shows that @xmath86 is compatible with the linear polynomial interpretation @xmath417 over @xmath14 .",
    "hence , linear polynomial interpretations over @xmath9 subsume linear polynomial interpretations over @xmath14 , which in turn subsume linear polynomial interpretations over @xmath15 , and these subsumptions are proper due to the results of @xcite , which were obtained using linear polynomial interpretations .",
