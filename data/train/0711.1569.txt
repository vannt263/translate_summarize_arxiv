    "_ `` the tension between giving away your information- to let people know what you have to offer- and charging them for it to recover your costs is a fundamental problem in the information economy . '' _     carl shapiro and hal r. varian in information rules : a strategic guide to the network economy , harvard business school press ( 1998 ) .",
    "+ the advent of the internet as a big playground for resource sharing among selfish agents with diverse interests , and the emergence of web as a giant platform for hosting information has raised a plethora of opportunities for commerce , as well as , a plenty of new design , pricing and complexity problems .",
    "one good example of a multi - billion dollar industry evolved as a consequence of web is the sponsored search advertising ( ssa ) , making fortunes for internet search giants such as google and yahoo ! , and has got tremendous attention in academia recently , due to various interesting research problems originated as a result of this continuously growing industry@xcite .",
    "one of the most important concern for such an industry or in general for the information economy is the _",
    "`` pricing problem''_. for example , for the goods like an ad - slot in the ssa which has no intrinsic value and is perishable , it is not clear what price should it be sold for .",
    "similarly , for a digital good , where the cost of reproduction is negligible , the standard way of pricing based on the production cost does not work .",
    "therefore , auctions are becoming a popular pricing mechanism in electronic commerce as they automatically adjust prices to market conditions , and specifically prices gets adjusted according to its value to the consumers rather than to the production costs .",
    "auction theory has a pretty impressive literature @xcite- from the lovely vickrey auction to the sponsored search auctions@xcite and the auctions of digital goods@xcite .",
    "the literature has so far focused mostly on the design of mechanisms that takes the revenue or the efficiency as a yardstick .",
    "this is perfectly logical as these are two very important metrics from the viewpoint of the seller / auctioneer and the society respectively .",
    "however , the scenarios where the _ capacity _ , which we define as _ `` the number of bidders the auctioneer wants to have a positive probability of getting the item '' _ , is a fundamental concern are ubiquitous in the information economy . for instance , in the sponsored search auctions or in online ad - exchanges , the true value of an ad - slot for an advertiser is inherently derived from the conversion - rate , which in turn depends on whether the advertiser actually obtained the ad - slot or not , which in turn depends on the capacity . in general , the same holds true for all information goods / digital goods .    in the present paper , our goal is to first motivate _ capacity _ as a fundamental metric in designing auctions in the information economy and then to initiate study of such a design framework for some simple and interesting scenarios . in section [ mot ] , we motivate the capacity as a fundamental and interesting additional metric on the top of revenue / efficiency for mechanism design . in section [ single ] ,",
    "we start with the _ capacity _ constrained framework for selling an indivisible item .",
    "we propose a simple way to incorporate capacity constraints via designing mechanisms to sell probability distributions .",
    "we show that such optimal probability distributions could be identified using a linear programming approach , objective being revenue , efficiency or a related function .",
    "further , we define a quantity called _ price of capacity _ to capture the tradeoff between capacity and revenue / efficiency and derive upper bounds on it . in section [ ssa ] ,",
    "we discuss the case of sponsored search auctions and also note that the auctioneer controlled probability spikes based auctions suggests a new model for sponsored search advertising , where a click is sold directly and not indirectly via allocating impressions . in section [ conc ] ,",
    "we conclude with a list of research directions for future work , inspired by the present paper .",
    "[ [ experience - goods ] ]   * experience goods : * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    a bidder might not know her true valuation for the item unless she acquires it sometimes meaning that the true value is inherently derived from the actual acquisition of the item .",
    "such a good is called an _ experience good_@xcite .",
    "experience goods are ubiquitous in the information economy as clearly all information goods are experience goods@xcite . sometimes , a particular good",
    "might also act as an experience for another good .",
    "for example , a particular song from a singer might act as an experience for another song of that singer . therefore , in the auction of an experience good , the values for some of the bidders can be known to them as they might have experienced it from an earlier purchase of this or a related item , and for the other bidders the values are still unknown and they have to simply guess this value if they are participating in the auction . for the second kind of bidders , even if their values might turn out to be pretty high , their guesses might not be high enough to actually acquire the item when revenue / efficiency is the only goal .",
    "moreover , they might be _ loss - averse_@xcite and would not bid a high value at all , due to the potential risk involved if the item does not turn out to be of high value to them . therefore , it is important that such bidders be given a chance to acquire the item , and consequently capacity becomes a fundamental metric in designing the mechanisms to achieve this goal .",
    "[ [ two - fold - exploration - in - sponsored - search - auctions ] ]   * two - fold exploration in sponsored search auctions : * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    first , the ad - slots in the ssa are necessarily experience goods for a new advertiser and the estimates for the advertisers getting lower ranked slots is also generally poor as they hardly get any clicks .",
    "the value of an ad - slot is derived from the clicks themselves ( i.e. rate of conversion or purchase given a click ) , and therefore , unless the bidder actually obtains a slot and receives user clicks , there is essentially no means for her to estimate her true value for the associated keyword .",
    "second , even if all the true valuations are known to the corresponding bidders , for each bidder the ssa involves a parameter called _ quality score _ of the bidder which is defined as the expected clickability of the bidder for the associated keyword if she obtains a slot .",
    "this parameter is also not known a priori and the auctioneer needs to estimate it .",
    "certainly , a model that automatically allows one to estimate these key parameters ( i.e. click - through - rates and true values ) is desirable .",
    "indeed , some mechanisms to incorporate explorations for estimating such important parameters has started to appear in literature@xcite .",
    "capacity as an additional metric can provide a generic framework for designing such exploration based mechanisms .

    "the providers are very likely to lie about the delivery times and it is hard to incorporate delivery times in designing the auction . if the goal of the auctioneer ( i.e. the company @xmath0 ) is cost minimization , it will buy the raw material from the provider with the minimum ask ( assume that the ask of @xmath3 is smaller than that of @xmath4 which is smaller than that of @xmath2 ) . now if the provider @xmath3 lied about the delivery time at least for a significant fraction of the total required units , @xmath0 s production gets delayed .",
    "if @xmath0 wants to switch to some other provider , run another auction and buys from @xmath4 , now it will buy at a higher cost and their is still a delay in @xmath0 s production as @xmath4 will take its time in delivery too . the time taken by @xmath4 could actually be smaller than that of @xmath3 s for the remaining units , however , still there is a delay .",
    "moreover , such delay might persist further as @xmath4 could also lie about its delivery time .",
    "it might have been better if @xmath0 would buy not only from @xmath3 to start with and give @xmath5 a chance as well .",
    "therefore , one way to reduce such delay times could be via increasing _",
    "capacity _ as per our definition .",
    "there is a single _ indivisible _ item for sale .",
    "there are @xmath6 bidders interested in the item .",
    "the bidder @xmath7 has a value @xmath8 for this item , for some bidders @xmath8 s are the actual true values while for some others these are just crude estimates / guesses . ] .",
    "the item is sold via an auction on an experiment designed by the seller / auctioneer .",
    "the experiment has @xmath9 outcomes @xmath10 with associated probabilities @xmath11 , where @xmath12 . therefore",
    ", the item is essentially sold via an auction of the probability spikes @xmath11 wherein the auctioneer can choose these probability spikes in advance or adaptively based on bidders reports so as to achieve some defined goal such as maximizing her profit or efficiency or to accommodate a wider pool of bidders .",
    "bidders bid on the experiment by reporting bids @xmath13 s to indicate their respective values of the item .",
    "_ at most one probability spike is assigned to each bidder .",
    "_ thus there are effectively two steps in this auction model .",
    "* stage 1 ( _ commit / compete _ ) : the bidders report their bids @xmath13 s and by way of using some mechanism , the auctioneer assigns the probability spikes to them and decides corresponding payments to be made by them . let us call a bidder a _ prospective winner _ if she was assigned one of the probability spikes .",
    "* stage 2 ( _ win or lose _ ) : the experiment is performed .",
    "if the outcome of the experiment is @xmath14 , then the _ prospective winner _ assigned to the spike @xmath15 is declared the _ winner _ , and is given the item .",
    "further , the auctioneer could choose various payment schemes such as -    * _ betting : _ every _ prospective winner _ is charged its payment decided in _",

    "* _ pay - per - acquisition _ : a bidder is charged the amount decided in _",
    "compete stage _ only when she is a _ winner _",
    "i.e. only when she actually acquires the item",
    ".    the above model can also be interpreted as selling of a single _ divisible _ item in terms of specified fractional bundles , the bundles corresponding to the probability spikes .      without loss of generality ,",
    "let us assume that @xmath16 .",
    "further , for notational simplicity let @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the allocation rule and @xmath19 be the payment rule decided in _",
    "compete stage_. thus , for @xmath20 , the spike @xmath21 is assigned to the bidder @xmath22 and for @xmath23 , the bidder @xmath22 is not assigned any spike .",
    "further , for @xmath20 , @xmath24 is the expected payment to be made by the bidder @xmath22 and @xmath25 otherwise",
    ". therefore , the expected utility of the bidder assigned to spike @xmath21 is given by @xmath26 for @xmath20 and is zero otherwise .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , let @xmath27 , then the famous _ vcg _ mechanism ranks the bidders by their bids ( and true values @xmath8 s as being a truthful mechanism ) and charges them their respective opportunity costs .",
    "that is , @xmath22 is the bidder with the @xmath21th maximum bid and @xmath28 for @xmath20 and zero otherwise . if the payment is done via the _ betting _ model then this is the amount charged to bidder @xmath21 in the _ compete / commit _ stage .",
    "if the payment is done via _ pay - per - acquisition _ and @xmath21 is the _ winner _ then she is charged an amount @xmath29 , and therefore , her expected payment is still @xmath24 as @xmath15 is the probability that she wins .",

    "a mechanism for selling probability spikes is called _ gap - wise monotone _ if the revenue of the auctioneer at the prescribed equilibrium point is _ gap - wise monotone _ and is called _ strongly gap - wise monotone _ if the social value ( i.e. efficiency ) at the prescribed equilibrium point is _ gap - wise monotone _ as well .    therefore , from lemma [ vcgrev ] and lemma [ vcgeff ] we obtain the following theorem .",

    "let @xmath52 be an allocation and @xmath53 be a payment rule , then @xmath54 is a walrasian equilibrium iff it is efficient .",
    "therefore , at a walrasian equilibrium , bidders are ranked according to their values and efficiency can be written as in the case of vcg i.e @xmath57 where @xmath58 for all @xmath59 .",
    "let @xmath54 be a walrasian equilibrium for selling probability spikes then the efficiency at this equilibrium is gap - wise monotone .",
    "this means that optimal efficiency is always gap - wise monotone .",

    "we develop a linear programming approach to identify optimal probability spikes subject to the capacity constraints in terms of spikes gaps , where the objective is a gap - wise monotone function . for such functions ,",
    "it is simpler to put the constraints in terms of spike - gaps than in terms of spikes themselves , however , it wo nt be hard to see that a similar approach can also be developed if we put the constraints in terms of the spikes , as well as , in the case of functions more general than the gap - wise monotone .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we omit any such details .",
    "let @xmath0 be a _ gap - wise monotone _ function and @xmath62 be a generic set of parameters with the property that @xmath63 and let us consider the following linear programming problem in variables @xmath46 s , @xmath64 the dual problem is @xmath65 and the _ kkt _ conditions are @xmath66 and therefore an optimal solution is @xmath67 @xmath68 as it can be checked to satisfy the _",

    "therefore , so long as @xmath0 is _ gap - wise monotone _ , the optimal solution to the primal remains the same as in equation [ optsol ] .",
    "it is quite intuitive as the best possible spike allowed by the capacity constraints is assigned to the best possible bidder ( i.e. @xmath74 ) , and all other spikes are the minimum possible as per the constraints .",
    "let @xmath47 be a gap - wise monotone function and the spike - gaps @xmath46 s satisfy conditions [ gap - ep ] , [ epsilonjs0 ] and [ epsilonjs ] , then the optimal choice of spike - gaps are given by equation [ optsol ] and the optimal value of @xmath0 is given by equation [ h - opt ]",

    "in particular , taking @xmath87 , @xmath85 and @xmath88 does the job .",
    "an interesting case to consider is when @xmath89 for all @xmath90 and @xmath72 otherwise . and",
    "in this case we can increase the capacity without loss in optimal value by taking @xmath91 and @xmath92 otherwise , where @xmath93 now let us define @xmath94 then it is clear that @xmath95 and therefore , as long as @xmath96 capacity can always be increased without any loss in the optimal value as discussed above , however there is a strict decrease in the optimal value if we wish to increase capacity from @xmath97 to @xmath98 .",
    "we can naturally define a parameter which we call _ price of capacity _ as follows : @xmath99 thus , _ price of capacity _ is the worst possible loss in optimal value while increasing capacity from @xmath97 to @xmath98 . again let us consider the case when all non - zero @xmath100 , then @xmath101    often our goal will be to maximize efficiency or revenue subject to the capacity constraints , and consequently such a loss may not be considered good . therefore , its really a price that we are paying for increasing capacity",
    "as we discussed in the section [ mot ] , one nice motivation for the study of capacity as a metric for mechanism design comes from the sponsored search advertising .",
    "we first describe the formal ssa model .",

    "@xmath105 s can be interpreted as the probability that an ad will be noticed when put in slot @xmath21 and it is assumed that @xmath106 for all @xmath107 and @xmath108 for @xmath109 .",
    "@xmath110 can be interpreted as the probability that an ad put by bidder @xmath7 will be clicked on if noticed and is referred to as the _ relevance_(quality score ) of bidder @xmath7 .",
    "the payoff / utility of bidder @xmath7 when given slot @xmath21 at a price of @xmath111 per - click is given by @xmath112 . as of",
    "now , google as well as yahoo ! use schemes closely modeled as rbr(rank by revenue ) with gsp(generalized second pricing ) .",
    "the bidders are ranked in the decreasing order of @xmath113 and the slots are allocated as per this ranks . let the @xmath114 be the bidder allocated to the slot @xmath7 according to this ranking rule , then @xmath114 is charged an amount equal to @xmath115 per - click .",
    "this mechanism has been extensively studied in recent years@xcite .",
    "the solution concept that is widely adopted to study this auction game is a refinement of nash equilibrium called _ symmetric nash equilibria(sne ) _ independently proposed by varian@xcite and edelman et al@xcite . for notational simplicity ,",
    "let @xmath116 , then under this refinement , the revenue of the auctioneer at equilibrium is given by @xmath117 in this section , we discuss how to incorporate the capacity constraints in the keyword auctions being currently used by google and yahoo!. we understand that there could be several ways for doing so , however , we consider a very simple and intuitive way of incorporating the capacity constraints via probability spikes as follows :    * the first @xmath118 slots are sold as usual to the @xmath118 high - ranked bidders . * the last slot ( i.e. the @xmath102th slot ) is sold via probability spikes @xmath11 among the @xmath9 bidders ranked @xmath102 through @xmath119 .",
    "@xmath9 is chosen to accommodate as many more bidders as the auctioneer wants .",

    "<S> for instance , in sponsored search auctions ( ssa s ) or in online ad - exchanges , the true value of an ad - slot for an advertiser is inherently derived from the conversion - rate , which in turn depends on whether the advertiser actually obtained the ad - slot or not ; thus , unless the capacity of the underlying auction is large , key parameters , such as true valuations and advertiser - specific conversion rates , will remain unknown or uncertain leading to inherent inefficiencies in the system . </S>",
    "<S> in general , the same holds true for all information goods / digital goods . </S>",
    "<S> we initiate a study of mechanisms , which take capacity as a yardstick , in addition to revenue / efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the case of a single indivisible item one simple way to incorporate capacity constraints is via designing mechanisms to sell probability distributions , and that under certain conditions , such optimal probability distributions could be identified using a linear programming approach . </S>",
    "<S> we define a quantity called _ price of capacity _ to capture the tradeoff between capacity and revenue / efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the case of sponsored search auctions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how general such an approach via probability spikes can be made , and potential directions for future investigations . </S>"
