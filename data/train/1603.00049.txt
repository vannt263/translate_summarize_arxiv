    "this paper deals with the existence of periodic points for annulus maps .",
    "a map is any continuous endomorphism of the open annulus @xmath3 .",
    "the _ degree _ of an annulus map @xmath1 is the integer @xmath4 such that @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the endomorphism of the fundamental group @xmath7 induced by @xmath1 .",
    "we are particularly interested in the case where the degree of the map has modulus greater than one .",
    "we will consider two different ways of saying that a map has abundance of periodic orbits .",
    "the first one is completeness , and is related to nielsen equivalence .",
    "the second one is the growth rate inequality which will be discussed shortly .",
    "a map of the annulus is complete if for every @xmath8 the number of nielsen classes of fixed points of @xmath9 is equal to @xmath10 .",
    "this is the maximum possible for a map of degree @xmath4 . roughly speaking , a continuous map @xmath11 of degree @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath12 is said to be complete if it has as many different nielsen classes of periodic points as the map @xmath13 acting on the circle .",
    "nielsen equivalence and completeness are explained in the next section .",
    "this notion of completeness is related to a great deal of problems on existence of periodic orbits in surface dynamics .",
    "for example , a complete map always satisfies the growth rate inequality : @xmath14    it is an open problem if the rate inequality holds for differentiable maps of degree @xmath4 acting on the sphere @xmath15 ( problem 3 posed in @xcite ) .",
    "other results related to the existence of periodic points for @xmath16 maps , ( not necessarily homeomorphisms ) were obtained by hagopian in @xcite , where some conditions are imposed on plane continua in order to obtain the existence of fixed points for any @xmath16 map defined on it .",
    "existence of recurrence is mostly present in maps with @xmath2 because @xmath2 implies an expansion on the direction of a simple nontrivial closed curve .",
    "this idea will be used frequently throughout the article .    the covering map",
    "@xmath17 defined in the annulus @xmath18 is a trivial example of a map without periodic points in the open annulus , and so the mere existence of periodic orbits becomes of interest . as covering maps",
    "lift to homeomorphisms of the plane , the problem also relates to surface homeomorphisms dynamics , in particular with what is called brouwer theory . in @xcite completeness of annulus coverings of degree @xmath4 , @xmath2 , was proved under the assumption that an essential continuum is preserved .    in this paper",
    "we study the same problem for general continuous maps ( not necesarily coverings ) .",
    "some definitions are needed before stating the results .",
    "we say that a map @xmath19 is complete on @xmath20 if @xmath1 is complete and every nielsen class has a representative in @xmath21 . whenever @xmath21 is a compact subset of the ( open ) annulus , denote by @xmath22 the union of @xmath21 with the bounded ( relatively compact ) components of its complement .",
    "[ t1 ] let @xmath19 be a surjective degree @xmath4 map of the annulus , and @xmath20 an essential continuum such that @xmath23 . if @xmath0 , then @xmath1 is complete on @xmath22 .",
    "the ingredientes for the proof of this theorem are lefschetz theory ( to obtain fixed points enclosed by curves with nonzero index ) , caratheodory theory ( constructions of crosscuts with determined properties ) and nielsen theory ( existence of fixed points in every nielsen class is assured by proving that every lift of @xmath1 to its universal covering has a fixed point ) .    the proof obtained fails for @xmath24 and it is easy to construct counterexamples of the proof .",
    "it is an open problem if the assertion of the theorem is true also for negative values of @xmath4 .",
    "the hypothesis @xmath25 is also important in the proof . assuming that @xmath21 is locally connected",
    ", this assumption and the surjectivity of @xmath1 can be dropped , and a satisfactory conclusion is obtained .",
    "[ t2 ] let @xmath19 be a degree @xmath4 map of the annulus , and @xmath20 a locally connected essential continuum such that @xmath26 .",
    "if @xmath2 , then @xmath1 is complete on @xmath22 .",
    "these statements imply the existence of periodic points in the set @xmath22 and there are examples where the periodic points are not contained in @xmath21 . posing some conditions on the behaviour at infinity of the map @xmath1 , completeness is obtained without any other assumption . to state",
    "these conditions , note that the annulus can be compactified with two points , called ends of @xmath3 .",
    "[ t3 ] let @xmath19 be a degree @xmath4 map of the annulus , where @xmath2 .",
    "assume that @xmath1 extends continuously to the ends of @xmath3 .",
    "each one of the following conditions imply that @xmath1 is complete .    1 .",
    "both ends of @xmath3 are attracting",
    "both ends of @xmath3 are repelling .",
    "see sections 4,5 and 6 where completeness is obtained for maps of the annulus under different sets of hypothesis . in section 2",
    "the notion of nielsen class is explained , in section 3 the index and lefschetz fixed point theorem are introduced without proofs , and some of the lemmata needed in the proofs of the theorems are included .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the proof of theorem [ t1 ] . in section 5 the proofs for locally connected @xmath21",
    "are given , and the last section contains two simple applications of these results to maps of the sphere .",
    "two fixed points @xmath27 and @xmath28 of a map @xmath11 are said _ nielsen equivalent _ if there exists a curve @xmath29 joining @xmath27 to @xmath28 such that @xmath30 is homotopic to @xmath29 relative to its endpoints .",
    "this is an equivalent relation whose classes are called nielsen classes .",
    "two fixed points that are very close are equivalent .",
    "of course the existence of a continuum of fixed points gives just one class of nielsen equivalent fixed points . if @xmath2 , then the map @xmath31 on the annulus @xmath32 has exactly @xmath33 fixed points , and also @xmath33 nielsen classes .",
    "it is not difficult to see that a degree @xmath4 map of the annulus can not have more than @xmath33 classes of fixed points .",
    "a map @xmath1 is _ complete _ if for every @xmath8 the number of nielsen classes of fixed points of @xmath9 is equal to that of the map @xmath34 .",
    "so , asking for a map @xmath1 to be complete is to ask that is has the maximum possible ( non artificial ) periodic orbits .",
    "the following proposition is a standard result in nielsen theory ( see jiang s book @xcite for further information on the subject ) and will be used to prove all the results throughout this paper .",
