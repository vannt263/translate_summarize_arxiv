    "supersymmetry is an elegant extension of spacetime symmetry , which arises naturally in string theory  the leading candidate for the fundamental theory of quantum gravity .",
    "a striking property of supersymmetry is its high capability to control quantum corrections ; in particular , it can protect the mass of a scalar field , such as the higgs field , which has sizable non - derivative interactions .",
    "this property was used to argue that the supersymmetric partners of the standard model particles are expected at the weak scale :  the well - known naturalness argument  @xcite . on the other hand , the large hadron collider ( lhc )",
    "experiment has not seen any sign of superpartners so far , which is beginning to threaten this argument  @xcite .",
    "the plethora of string theory vacua  @xcite suggests that the naive naturalness argument should be modified . because of the eternal nature of inflation  @xcite",
    ", all these vacua are expected to be physically populated , leading to the picture of the multiverse ( or quantum many - universes  @xcite ) . in this picture ,",
    "our universe is one of the many universes in which low - energy physical laws take different forms , and the naturalness argument is replaced with the _ typicality _ argument  @xcite :  we are typical observers among all the observers in the multiverse .",
    "specifically , the probability that physical parameters @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) are observed between @xmath0 and @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 with @xmath4 where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) are parameters other than @xmath0 which vary independently of @xmath0 s ; @xmath7 is the a priori distribution function determined by the statistics of the landscape of vacua and their population dynamics , while @xmath8 is the anthropic weighting factor representing the probability of finding observers for a given @xmath9 .",
    "as is well known , this potentially allows us to understand the smallness of the cosmological constant ( or dark energy ) observed in our universe  @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we consider what eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) implies for the masses of superpartners .",
    "( for earlier studies , see e.g.   @xcite . )",
    "we argue that under a set of simple assumptions the multiverse leads to the spectrum often called spread or mini - split supersymmetry , which has attracted renewed interest recently  :  the gauginos are in the tev region with the other superpartners two or three orders of magnitude heavier .",
    "( for earlier work , see  @xcite . )",
    "we find it encouraging that the typicality ( or refined naturalness ) argument , suggested by the fundamental theory , can lead  under rather simple assumptions  to a superpartner spectrum that does not have tension with the lhc results so far while allowing the possibility for future discovery .",
    "note that this spectrum preserves the successful prediction of supersymmetric gauge coupling unification , and yet does not suffer from ( or at least highly ameliorates ) problems associated with low energy supersymmetry , such as the supersymmetric flavor and @xmath10 problems and the cosmological gravitino problem .    throughout the letter ,",
    "we assume that the electroweak scale is anthropically selected in the multiverse .",
    "while the physical effects that are responsible for this selection are not fully understood , we at least know that changing it by a factor of a few leads to drastic changes of the universe  @xcite .",
    "we therefore take @xmath11 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) , and see what distribution of the superpartner mass scale @xmath12 is obtained . here , @xmath13 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the standard model higgs field calculated in terms of parameters @xmath9 , and @xmath14 is the observed value ( in units of some mass scale that is fixed in the analysis ) . in our analysis , we vary essentially only parameters directly relevant for our question :  the overall supersymmetry breaking mass scale @xmath15 , the supersymmetric higgs mass @xmath16 , and the vev of the superpotential @xmath17 , which is needed to cancel the cosmological constant .",
    "we do not expect , however , that our basic conclusion is sensitive to this restriction .    a key element that characterizes our scenario is the assumption that the supersymmetric higgs mass term ( the @xmath16 term)which is the only relevant supersymmetric operator in the @xmath18-parity conserving minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)is not protected by any artificial symmetry .",
    "this implies that the theoretically natural size of @xmath16 is of @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the cutoff scale of the mssm , and @xmath16 takes a value close to @xmath15 only because of the anthropic selection of the weak scale .",
    "this provides a simple environmental solution to the @xmath16 problem .",
    "together with the assumptions that supersymmetry is broken dynamically and that the supersymmetry breaking field is not a singlet , we find that the claimed spectrum is obtained after applying all the selection effects , especially that associated with the abundance of dark matter .",
    "this basic argument will be presented in the next section .",
    "a particularly interesting realization of our scenario is obtained in the context of the minimal supersymmetric grand unified theory ( gut )  @xcite . in this theory ,",
    "the @xmath16 term much smaller than the unified scale is obtained only as a result of a fine cancellation between different contributions , so that the setup relevant for our scenario is realized automatically . despite the minimality of the model , there is no problem of doublet - triplet splitting or unacceptably fast dimension-5 proton decay .",
    "the precision of gauge coupling unification is also improved compared with conventional weak scale supersymmetry .",
    "this , therefore , provides one of the most attractive realizations of supersymmetric gut .    at the end of this letter",
    ", we also comment on the case in which the supersymmetry breaking field is a singlet . in this case , the superpartner masses can be at a high energy scale with the vevs of the two higgs doublets being almost equal .",
    "this allows for realizing the high scale supersymmetry scenario discussed in ref .",
    "we postulate that in the landscape of possible theories in the multiverse , probabilities relevant for observers are dominated by the branch having the following properties :    * low energy theory below some high scale @xmath20 is the mssm with @xmath18-parity conservation ( possibly with the qcd axion supermultiplet to solve the strong @xmath10 problem ) .",
    "we are agnostic about the precise nature of the scale @xmath20 here , except that we assume it is not many orders of magnitude smaller than the reduced planck scale @xmath21 .",
    "later we will consider the case in which @xmath20 is identified as the unification scale of supersymmetric gut .",
    "* supersymmetry is broken dynamically as a result of dimensional transmutation associated with some hidden sector gauge group so that @xmath22  @xcite , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the hidden sector gauge coupling and an @xmath25 coefficient , respectively . *",
    "the superfield @xmath26 responsible for supersymmetry breaking , @xmath27 , is not a singlet .",
    "this prohibits the terms @xmath28_{\\theta^2}$ ] and @xmath29_{\\theta^2}$ ] to appear in the lagrangian at tree level , where @xmath30 and @xmath31 represent the two higgs doublet and gauge strength superfields of the mssm , respectively .",
    "in addition to these somewhat `` standard '' assumptions , we also postulate that the branch in the landscape dominating the probabilities has the property :    * there is no `` artificial '' symmetry below @xmath20 controlling the size of operators in the mssm ( except for approximate , and perhaps accidental , flavor symmetries associated with the smallness of the yukawa couplings ) .",
    "in particular , there is no approximate global symmetry that dictates the values of @xmath16 and @xmath17 , such as the `` peccei - quinn '' symmetry @xmath32 , @xmath10 symmetry , or a continuous @xmath18 symmetry .    as we will see",
    ", this implies that the @xmath16 problem is solved by the anthropic selection associated with electroweak symmetry breaking . in the fundamental picture in the landscape",
    ", this corresponds to postulating that having a theoretical mechanism of suppressing the @xmath16 term `` costs '' more than the fine - tuning needed to make @xmath33 small to obtain acceptable electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the postulate  ( iii ) above implies that at the leading order , supersymmetry breaking masses in the mssm sector arise from operators of the form @xmath34_{\\theta^4}$ ] and @xmath35_{\\theta^4}$ ] , where @xmath36 represents the mssm matter and higgs fields , as well as from tree - level supergravity effects .",
    "this yields @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 is the gravitino mass , and @xmath40 represent the ( non - holomorphic ) supersymmetry breaking squared masses for the sfermion and higgs fields while @xmath41 is the holomorphic supersymmetry breaking higgs mass squared .",
    "@xmath42 are coefficients , which we take to scan for values of order unity in the landscape , and @xmath43 is the mediation scale of supersymmetry breaking , which we take to be roughly of the order of ",
    "within an order of magnitude of  the reduced planck scale :  @xmath44 .",
    "we now discuss the probability distribution of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 in this setup . with the assumption in ( ii ) , it is reasonable to expect that the a priori distribution of @xmath15 is approximately flat in logarithm :  @xmath45 . on the other hand , the assumption in ( iv ) implies that the distribution of @xmath16 is given by @xmath46 for @xmath47 , and similarly for @xmath17 .",
    "we thus take @xmath48 and @xmath49 with @xmath50 and study what values of these parameters are selected by anthropic conditions . in our analysis , we ignore possible variations of all the other parameters of the theory , but we do not expect that our basic conclusion is overturned when the full variations are performed with appropriate anthropic conditions .",
    "this approach is analogous to that adopted in the original argument for the cosmological constant in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us first isolate the selection effects from the weak scale and the cosmological constant by writing @xmath51 where @xmath13 and @xmath52 are the values of the higgs vev and the vacuum energy density calculated in terms of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ; @xmath53 is the anthropic upper bound on the value of @xmath52 , which we have taken symmetric around @xmath54 for simplicity , and @xmath55 is a constant not too far from order unity .",
    "we expect that the residual anthropic weighting factor , @xmath56 , does not depend strongly on the values of @xmath17 or @xmath42 in the relevant parameter region , which we assume to be the case .    by integrating over @xmath17 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) , using the expression @xmath57 with @xmath58 , we obtain @xmath59 where @xmath60 , and @xmath13 depends on @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath61 .",
    "an important point is that the integration of @xmath17 does not provide an extra probability bias for @xmath15 , @xmath33 , @xmath62 , or @xmath61",
    "@xcite  the effective a priori distribution function for these parameters is still given by @xmath63 with the phase , @xmath64 , unconstrained .",
    "this leads to the gravitino mass roughly comparable to the sfermion masses : @xmath65 in fact , we may naturally expect that @xmath66 , so that @xmath67 is comparable to or somewhat ( e.g.  up to an order of magnitude ) smaller than @xmath15 .    the selection from electroweak symmetry breaking acts on the mass - squared matrix of the doublet higgs bosons @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "it requires the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath71 to be @xmath72 . for @xmath73 ,",
    "it is not possible to satisfy this requirement . for @xmath74 ,",
    "on the other hand , the requirement can be met for some values of @xmath61 if @xmath75 , while a value of @xmath33 much larger than @xmath15 makes the eigenvalues of @xmath71 both positive regardless of @xmath61 .",
    "this therefore selects the value of @xmath33 to be @xmath76 since the probability of having @xmath77 is suppressed by the fact that @xmath78 .",
    "more explicitly , for a fixed @xmath15 , the probability distribution for @xmath33 is given roughly by @xmath79 .",
    "we thus find that by integrating over @xmath33 , @xmath62 , and @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : after - cc ] ) , we obtain @xmath80 where @xmath81 , and we have assumed that the anthropic weighting factor @xmath56 does not depend strongly on the precise value of @xmath16 .",
    "interestingly , for @xmath74 , the preference to smaller values of @xmath15 by electroweak fine - tuning , @xmath82 , is exactly canceled by the a priori distribution of @xmath16 , which through eq .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) prefers larger values of @xmath15 , i.e.  @xmath83 .",
    "there is , therefore , no net preference for the scale of superpartner masses before a further anthropic selection , @xmath84 , is applied .",
    "what function should we consider for @xmath84 ?",
    "note that with eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m32 ] ) and ( [ eq : mu ] ) , the pattern of the spectrum of the superpartners and the mssm higgs bosons ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 ) is fixed in terms of the single mass parameter @xmath15 :  in order of decreasing masses @xmath88 where @xmath89 represents the higgsinos , @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the gravitino , and the lightest set of superpartners are the gauginos with masses @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) , which are generated by anomaly mediation   ( the first term ) and higgsino - higgs loops ( the second term ) . here ,",
    "@xmath94 are the standard model gauge couplings ( in the su(5 ) normalization for u(1 ) hypercharge ) , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "our question is :  what environmental effects do we expect when we vary @xmath15 keeping the relations in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : m32 ] ) and ( [ eq : mu ] ) ?    in general , there could be many subtle effects associated with a variation of @xmath15 . for example , for fixed high energy gauge and yukawa couplings , varying @xmath15 leads to changes of low energy parameters such as the qcd scale and the quark and lepton masses .",
    "these changes , however , may be compensated by the corresponding variations of the high energy parameters , and their full analysis will require detailed knowledge of the statistical properties of the landscape beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "below , we will focus on what is arguably the dominant environmental effect of varying @xmath15 :  the change of the relic abundance of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) contributing to dark matter of the universe .    as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this effect leads to a large `` forbidden window '' for the value of @xmath15 , in which the lsp relic abundance far exceeds the observed dark matter abundance and @xmath99 .",
    "while the precise nature of the anthropic upper bound on the dark matter abundance is not well understood , we expect that there is some upper bound . this upper bound may not be sharp or close to the observed value ( for discussions on possible upper bounds , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but it still excludes a large region of @xmath15 between some values @xmath100 and @xmath101 . for the spectrum in eqs",
    "( [ eq : spectrum-1 ]    [ eq : spectrum-3 ] ) , the lsp is the wino in most of the parameter space , whose relic abundance has both thermal and non - thermal contributions ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed analysis .",
    "( if @xmath102 in eq .  (",
    "[ eq : spectrum-2 ] ) is small , the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum-3 ] ) may dominate and the bino can be the lsp ; the allowed dark matter window in this case is small  @xcite . ) the probability distribution for the superpartner mass scale @xmath15 is then given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : p - tildem ] ) as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the normalization constant .",
    "a reasonable ( though highly uncertain ) estimate for @xmath100 is given by @xmath105 and @xmath101 is given by the value of @xmath15 in which the lsp becomes sufficiently heavier than the reheating temperature after inflation @xmath106 , which we assume to take some high scale value , e.g.  @xmath107 ( possibly selected by the requirement of baryogenesis ) .",
    "the resulting distribution is depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] .    with eq .",
    "( [ eq : p - tildem-2 ] ) , it is easy to imagine that @xmath15 is selected randomly in the logarithmic scale in the region between @xmath108 and @xmath100 .",
    "in particular , this can lead to the spread or mini - split type spectrum in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : spectrum-1 ]    [ eq : spectrum-3 ] ) with @xmath109 as a typical spectrum one observes in the multiverse .",
    "the phenomenology of this spectrum is discussed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein .",
    "in particular , the observed higgs boson mass of @xmath110 can be easily accommodated , and dark matter can be composed of a mixture of the wino and the qcd axion ( and possibly other components as well ) with some unknown ratio , which depends on the statistical distribution of the axion decay constant , among other things .",
    "a particularly attractive and solid realization of our scenario is obtained in the context of the minimal supersymmetric su(5 ) gut  @xcite . in this theory , the su(5 )",
    "symmetry is broken by the vev of @xmath111 .",
    "the superpotential relevant for the gut breaking is @xmath112 leading to @xmath113 . for a non - singlet supersymmetry breaking field @xmath26",
    ", the shift of this vacuum due to supersymmetry breaking effects is small .",
    "the superpotential for the higgs fields , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , is given by @xmath116 with the @xmath117 vev , this leads to the supersymmetric masses for the mssm higgs doublets @xmath30 and their gut partners @xmath118 : @xmath119 since both terms in the right - hand side are of the order of the unification scale @xmath120 , having @xmath121 requires a large fine - tuning of parameters . with this fine - tuning",
    ", @xmath122 is of order @xmath123 .",
    "the situation described above is exactly the one needed to realize our scenario .",
    "in fact , we may apply the argument in the previous section without modification by identifying @xmath20 as the unification scale @xmath123 .",
    "this realization has several virtues from the gut point of view as well .",
    "first , the notorious doublet - triplet splitting problem is automatically `` solved '' because of the environmental selection for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "second , the precision of gauge coupling unification is also improved with the superpartner spectrum discussed here  @xcite , compared with the case in conventional weak scale supersymmetry . the dangerous dimension-5 proton decay caused by exchange of @xmath118",
    "is also suppressed because of the large sfermion masses , if the @xmath124-@xmath125 element of the doublet squark mass - squared matrix is sufficiently small  @xcite .",
    "( this is ensured if the low energy theory has an appropriate flavor structure analogous to that in the yukawa couplings , which also suppresses possible contributions from cutoff - scale suppressed tree - level operators  @xcite . )",
    "this scenario , therefore , provides one of the most simple and attractive realizations of supersymmetric gut .",
    "we finally comment on the case in which the assumption  ( iii ) is modified :   the supersymmetry breaking field @xmath26 is a singlet . in this case , the direct coupling of @xmath26 to the higgs fields @xmath126 is allowed , yielding @xmath127 . by integrating over @xmath128 in the expression in eq .",
    "( [ eq : prob ] ) using the electroweak symmetry breaking condition @xmath129 , we find that the probability in the @xmath130-@xmath131 plane is peaked at @xmath132 ; more explicitly , @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the largest value of @xmath135 in the landscape , which we expect is not too far from @xmath25 , and @xmath136 is the anthropic weighting factor without including that for electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "an important element in @xmath136 arises from the fact that for @xmath137 , a higgs loop makes the mass squared for the top squark negative @xmath138 .",
    "assuming that such a region , @xmath139 , is environmentally disallowed , we find @xmath140 so we expect that the superpartner mass scale is high . moreover , we find that @xmath141 in most of the selected parameter space .",
    "this , therefore , provides a simple realization of the high scale supersymmetry scenario discussed in ref .",
