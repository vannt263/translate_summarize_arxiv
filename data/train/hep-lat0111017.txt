    "instantons are field configurations of non - abelian su(@xmath0 ) gauge theories , which lead to non - perturbative effects . in recent years",
    "they have been studied in lattice gauge theories by means of monte carlo calculations by different groups @xcite .    in the dilute gas approximation",
    "the logarithm of the partition function contains an integral over instanton sizes , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 is the scale parameter .",
    "the integrand increases with @xmath4 , leading to an infrared divergence .",
    "this is an artifact of using the semiclassical approximation after it has become invalid , i.e.  for @xmath5 .",
    "if the semiclassical approximation is meaningful at all , a solution of this problem in the context of the full instanton ensemble is required .",
    "the simplest way is to cut the integrations off at some ad - hoc value @xmath6 .",
    "but the dominant contribution comes from large @xmath7 near the cut - off where the assumption of diluteness fails .",
    "moreover , the introduction of an ad - hoc cut - off leads to inconsistencies with the renormalization group @xcite .    in order to solve the problem",
    "it has been proposed that instanton sizes are cut off in a dynamical way @xcite .",
    "the cut - off should originate from configurations where instantons start to overlap .",
    "the interaction is expected to suppress overlapping instantons and to result in a self - consistent cut - off .    in connection with the dynamical",
    "cut - off the distribution of instanton sizes is of central importance . for small sizes the distribution",
    "is predicted to be @xmath8 by the dilute gas approximation . for large sizes @xmath4 , where the dynamical cut - off is in effect ,",
    "not much is known about the distribution .",
    "there are arguments @xcite in favour of a suppression like @xmath9    we have investigated @xcite the distribution of instanton sizes in a model @xcite where the instanton interactions are approximated by a repulsive hard core potential .",
    "the radius of an instanton core varies proportional to the size @xmath7 of the instanton .",
    "although this approximation appears to be crude , the general features of the instanton ensemble with a dynamical cut - off are present .",
    "in @xmath10 dimensions the distribution of instanton sizes is exactly given by @xmath11 where we recognize an exponential suppression of large instanton sizes .    in higher dimensions , @xmath12",
    ", we obtained approximate expressions by means of a van der waals type approximation @xcite , @xmath13 for small @xmath4 it grows powerlike with the semiclassical exponent @xmath14 .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath15 in the exponential decay at large @xmath4 should be considered with reservations , because the saddle point approximations are of uncertain quality there .",
    "we have studied the size distribution also by means of grand canonical monte carlo simulations of the simplified instanton gas model . in the case of @xmath10 dimensions",
    "the monte carlo data agree very well with the available exact result ( [ nrho1 ] ) .    in the more interesting case of four space - time dimensions ( @xmath16 ) we consider @xmath17 , which is the value for su(2 ) gauge theory .",
    "the resulting size distribution shows the expected behaviour . for small instanton radii a power law with exponent @xmath18",
    "can be confirmed . in order to study the behaviour of @xmath19 for large @xmath4 we considered the ratio @xmath20 and tried fits of the form @xmath21 . in agreement with the theoretical results they showed that @xmath22 depends on @xmath18 , while @xmath23 is nearly independent of it . in fig .",
    "[ fit ] the result of a fit in the interval @xmath24 $ ] is shown .",
    "the main interest is in the exponent @xmath23 .",
    "we find @xmath25 , and the fit leads to @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for @xmath28 , the su(3 ) case , the results for @xmath23 are the same within the present errors .    in recent years",
    "much effort has been devoted to lattice monte carlo calculations of properties of the instanton ensemble , and some quantitative statements have been given .",
    "for small @xmath4 , lattice calculations appear to support the power law ( [ smallrho ] ) . for the large-@xmath4 distribution , de forcrand et al .",
    "predict an exponential decrease with @xmath29 from their @xmath30 lattice data @xcite .",
