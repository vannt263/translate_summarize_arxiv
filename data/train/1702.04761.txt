    "the prediction of plasmonic laser ( spaser ) @xcite and its experimental realization in various systems @xcite have been among the highlights in the rapidly developing field of plasmonics during past decade @xcite . first observed in gold nanoparticles ( np ) coated by dye - doped silica shells @xcite , spaser action was reported in hybrid plasmonic waveguides @xcite , semiconductor quantum dots on metal film @xcite , plasmonic nanocavities and nanocavity arrays @xcite , metallic np and nanorods @xcite , and more recently , carbon - based structures @xcite and hyperbolic materials @xcite . small spaser size well below the diffraction limit gives rise to wealth of promissing applications @xcite .",
    "the spaser feedback mechanism is based on energy transfer ( et ) between quantum emitters ( qe ) , constituting gain medium , and resonant plasmon mode . even though a metal nanostructure usually possesses discrete spectrum of localized plasmon modes , e.g. , characterized by angular momentum @xmath0 for spherical systems , the qe coupling to _ nonresonant _ modes with well separated frequencies",
    "is typically considered sufficiently weak to be neglected . however , this is a good approximation for high quality cavity modes , while plasmon resonances are characterized by much broader lineshape due to large ohmic losses in metal , so that a significant fraction of qe energy is transferred to nonresonant modes at small qe distances to the metal surface , where the coupling to nonresonant modes is large @xcite . during past decade ,",
    "numerous experiments reported plasmon - enhanced fluorescence of dye molecules or semiconductor quantum dots near metal nps which , however , was quenched as qes moved closer to the np surface @xcite .",
    "fluorescence quenching in plasmonic systems is best illustrated by distance dependency of quantum efficiency @xmath1 of a radiating dipole with frequency tuned to the dipole plasmon resonance in spherical metal np ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . here",
    "@xmath2 is plasmon - enhanced radiative decay rate and @xmath3 is nonradiative decay rate due to qe coupling to high-@xmath0 nonresonant modes ( see below for detail ) . with decreasing qe - np distance @xmath4 , nonradiative qe decay into nonresonant modes dominates , so",
    "that , for distances comparable to np radius @xmath5 , the quantum efficiency is low .",
    "fluorescence quantum efficiency for a qe near spherical au np is shown vs. qe - np distance for several np sizes . ]    in plasmonic systems with gain , the effect of gain coupling to nonresonant modes is twofold .",
    "first , qes coupling to higher - order plasmons ( with higher frequencies ) should lead to upward shift of spaser frequency , and , second , the energy transfer ( et ) from qes to nonresonant modes can interfere with the feedback mechanism , resulting in higher population inversion threshold .",
    "both effects have increasingly negative impact on on spaser action as the ( average ) distance between qes and the metal surface is reduced , which raises the issue of _ spaser quenching _ for substantially close gain - metal proximity . while spaser action has been modeled in a number of specific systems @xcite , little work has been done on the role of nonresonant modes . a recent numerical study involving core - shell np indicated limited impact of nonresonant modes on the spaser action @xcite .",
    "however , no comprehensive study on the role of nonresonant modes in spaser action has so far been carried out .",
    "the goal of this paper is to develop an analytical model for plasmonic systems with gain that includes gain coupling to nonresonant modes , and to establish criteria for spaser quenching .",
    "we show that inhomogeneity of gain distribution near the metal surface gives rise to plasmon mode mixing leading to increase of spaser frequency and population and population inversion threshold .",
    "however , with increasing gain concentration , role of nonresonant modes in spaser action is reduced and their overall effect is much weaker in plasmon - enhanced fluorescence . for np - based spasers , we obtain a simple condition for spaser quenching onset , which we support by numerical calculations .",

    "[ sec4 ] , we study the effect of mode mixing on spaser condition , and obtain a simple criteria for spaser onset supported bu numerical calculations . we summarize our findings in sec .  [ sec5 ] , and provide some technical detail in the appendices .",

    ", we show the deviations of @xmath92 and @xmath93 from the corresponding values @xmath91 and @xmath69 for resonant mode coupling only ( i.e. , @xmath90 ) .",
    "for small distances @xmath104 , the effect of nonresonant modes can be substantial depending on the ensemble size , consistent with our estimate ( [ estimate ] ) . with decreasing @xmath4 , the spaser frequency @xmath92 shifts upwards ( high - order modes have larger frequencies ) , and so does threshold @xmath93 to compensate the energy leakage to nonresonant modes not participating in the feedback .",
    "at the same time , with increasing ensemble size @xmath6 , the deviations of spaser frequency and of threshold population inversion from their single - mode values are significantly reduced , indicating restoration of spherical symmetry as fluctuations of the qe distribution diminish .",
    "note that the overall effect of nonresonant modes on spaser action is significantly weaker than on single - qe fluorescence . the calculated quantum efficiency @xmath115 , shown in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "( see appendix b for detail ) , falls below 20% at distances @xmath116 , and it is even lower for smaller nps , indicating that fluorescence is largely quenched at such distances .",
    "in contrast , spaser quenching become substantial only for ( average ) gain - np separations well below np size ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , while for larger distances , spaser quenching is largely suppressed .",
    "finally , we considered here a specific setup with all qes distributed at about equal distance to the metal np , e.g. , on top of dielectric shell .",
    "such configuration provides us with better control over gain coupling to nonresonant modes and allows straightforward comparison with the single qe radiation quenching near the metal surface . in a more common setup",
    ", gain is distributed within some region with volume comparable or exceeding the metal volume , e.g. , within the dielectric shell , implying that only a relatively small fraction of qes , located sufficiently close to the surface , can undergo energy exchange with higher - order modes , whose electric fields decay rapidly outside the metal structure.therefore , for a given gain concentration , extending the gain region size should lower the spaser threshold by suppressing quenching effects .",
    "in summary , we studied the effect of energy transfer between gain and nonresonant plasmon modes on spaser action .",
    "we found that mode mixing , originating from inhomogeneity of gain distribution , interferes with the feedback mechanism and leads to the upward shift of spaser frequency and population inversion threshold .",
