    "since the greisen  zatsepin",
    " kuzmin ( gzk ) cutoff for protons with energies @xmath4ev was predicted in 1966 @xcite , issues regarding ultrahigh  energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) have remained one of the main topics in high  energy astrophysics . because of vanishingly small flux of such energetic particles , arrays enormous in area should be used over a  long period of  time . at present a  sufficient number of experimental events have been collected to provide us with an  idea on the behavior of the differential energy spectrum of uhecrs .",
    "now the existence of the gzk cutoff is generally considered to be proved by measurements of the largest uhecr facilities , hires @xcite and pierre auger observatory ( auger ) @xcite .",
    "it is appropriate , however , to recall that the experimental data reported by agasa @xcite indicated the  opposite effect .",
    "although the suppression of the cr flux at ultrahigh energies has been reported by both hires and auger , their spectra differ significantly in shape .",
    "for instance , while the hires collaboration clearly locates the start point of the gzk cutoff @xcite , one of two fits of the auger spectrum has a  smooth form @xcite .",
    "below we discuss the approximations suggested by both teams .",
    "another , more surprising , contradiction between their observations is that the hires results demonstrate the proton  dominated cr composition at energies from @xmath5ev up to @xmath6ev @xcite , whereas auger points out a  transition from protons to heavy nuclei , starting with energy of a  few times @xmath7ev @xcite .",
    "this problem was discussed , for example , in  @xcite .    to describe experimental data and therefore to determine likely sources of uhecrs ,",
    "various models of initial mass composition and acceleration conditions were considered ( see , for instance , @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless the origin of ultrahigh  energy particles remains an  open question . in this paper",
    "we present spectra and mass composition obtained within a  model @xcite in which nuclei of moderate  power seyfert galaxies are put forward as uhecr sources .",
    "comparison of calculation results with measurements allows us to reveal appropriate acceleration regimes and besides to define somehow distances to the most probable sources .",
    "it is well known that particles generated above the gzk threshold shift to the region of lower energies in propagating through the space , shaping peculiarities in the cosmic ray spectrum , the so - called dip and bump @xcite@xcite .",
    "study of these spectral features provides insight into uhecr sources . but a  more natural approach for investigation of uhecr particles is to exploit data near their maximum acceleration energy , so here we restrict our consideration to the region above the gzk cutoff .",
    "main features of the above  mentioned model are as follows .",
    "charged particles are accelerated to ultrahigh energies at the front of shocks generated in relativistic jets of sources .",
    "the jet matter resembles one of the accretion disk , therefore the accelerated particles can be both protons and heavy ions .",
    "because of lack of information about magnetic field strength within the jets , its value can be regarded as an  arbitrary parameter specified on the assumption that particles should reach their maximum acceleration energies .",
    "( though magnetic field within the jets of some active galactic nuclei has been estimated , e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "the expression of the maximum energies for nuclei with charge @xmath8 , derived on basis of this model , has the form : @xmath9 the dependence @xmath10 arises due to energy losses ( see @xcite ) . for protons",
    "it is necessary to take into account @xmath11 so their maximum energy is equal to @xmath12 in  section [ res ] the numerical values in eq . and",
    "are varied a  bit to obtain a  better agreement with the experimental data .",
    "such operation is fully justified as at the moment it is hardly possible to set these values unambiguously .",
    "the mass composition of the particles at sources is assumed to be mixed .",
    "we consider stable nuclei with the highest natural content .",
    "besides protons , these are nuclei of @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "their abundance ratios are taken from  @xcite .",
    "the model proposed makes it possible to estimate the maximum acceleration energies @xmath27 but does not specify the shape of the energy spectrum near them .",
    "so we adopt a  reasonable assumption that particle energy spectra at sources obey a  broken inverse power law with indices  @xmath3 at energies @xmath28 and @xmath29 otherwise .",
    "a  similar form was used in @xcite to describe roughly the energy spectrum of cosmic rays accelerated in supernova shocks .",
    "it is necessary to stress that at large values of  @xmath3 the broken power law should be used only in the vicinity of @xmath27 as its extrapolation to substantially lower energies may demand too high efficiency from the sources . in the case of a  power law spectrum",
    "the number of nuclei with mass number  @xmath30 and energy in the range of @xmath31 is proportional to @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "if the injection index is high enough , the fraction of heavy nuclei is essentially increased at a  given energy .",
    "the generation spectra of some abundant nuclei at energies of @xmath33ev are presented in figure  [ init_spectra ] , with two different values of the index . for  @xmath34 ,",
    "nuclei of helium dominate among the particles up to @xmath35ev , while nuclei of oxygen and iron prevail alternately , starting with @xmath36ev . if @xmath37 , the pattern changes substantially and iron nuclei begin to dominate over the whole energy range of  interest .",
    ", @xmath13 , @xmath16 , @xmath26 ) at a source , with @xmath34 ( the left panel ) and @xmath37 ( the right panel ) .",
    "the total spectrum ( solid thick curve ) is normalized to unity at @xmath38ev . ]",
    "the acceleration model adopted was developed for moderate ",
    "power seyfert nuclei . as possible sources of uhecrs , this type of active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , with redshifts @xmath39 , was identified in @xcite .",
    "we follow this hypothesis and refer to them as nearby sources .",
    "their distances are set according to  @xcite .",
    "based on these assumptions we calculate spectra and mass composition of cosmic rays incoming to the earth at energies from @xmath40ev to @xmath41ev . in this range the main processes by which uhecr particles lose energy in propagating through the space are 1 ) disintegration of nuclei due to interactions with infrared ( ir ) and cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , and 2 ) pion production by protons on cmb radiation . in  addition , to estimate the contribution of nuclei to secondary protons , we extend the energy range up to lorentz factor @xmath42 , so photopion production by the nuclei is also taken into account .",
    "it should be noted that the pair production process is ignored here in order to take advantage of the lorentz factor conservation in photodisintegration and photopion production ( see eq . ) .",
    "such approximation is reasonable for light nuclei but it may not be reliable for heavy species .",
    "in fact , the absorption of iron nuclei due to pair production constitutes an  essential part ( @xmath43% ) of the total absorption at energies approximately from @xmath44ev to @xmath45ev @xcite .",
    "but since we consider sources of uhecr located mainly at distances below 40  mpc and the mean free path of iron nuclei exceeds 100  mpc at the energy range mentioned , our assumption is reasonable .",
    "computing the mean free paths of particles requires information about ir background radiation and cross sections of the above  mentioned processes .",
    "data on the spectral density of ir radiation in host galaxies and intergalactic medium are taken from @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "our calculations show that interactions of nuclei with galactic background do not lead to any substantial changes , thus the results presented below are obtained assuming only the intergalactic absorption .",
    "the cross sections of different photodisintegration channels for isotopes of nuclei from @xmath46 to @xmath47 are computed with the talys code @xcite . for nuclei @xmath48 ,",
    "@xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath13 , we use the total photodisintegration cross sections from the geant4 code @xcite . each of them includes two reaction channels assumed as equiprobable .",
    "the photopion production cross sections for @xmath26 , @xmath13 and @xmath51 are also derived by means of geant4 .",
    "corresponding cross sections for nuclei with @xmath52 are determined by multiplying that for @xmath26 by @xmath53 as it follows from the concept of a  universal curve @xcite . in the case of @xmath54",
    "the cross sections are obtained by interpolation between those for @xmath13 and @xmath51 .",
    "a  comparison between mean free paths calculated for proton and iron nucleus and those from @xcite shows that they are in reasonable agreement at energies under consideration .",
    "in this section we present computational approaches used to describe propagation of protons and heavy nuclei as well as to construct their spectra .",
    "we consider both stable and radioactive nuclei ( with lifetimes of more than several minutes ) arising due to photodisintegration of particles accelerated at their sources ( see section [ assump ] ) . over a  hundred isotopes in total",
    "are taken into account .",
    "when an  ultrahigh  energy heavy nucleus propagates through the space , its energy per nucleon remains constant and its total energy is shared between particles in proportion to their masses after disintegration .",
    "thus lorentz factor @xmath55 is the same for all nuclei produced .",
    "this is not correct for photopion production because pions take some energy away . but",
    "this process becomes dominant at very high energies when one needs to estimate the flux of secondary protons .",
    "since the number of nuclei with such energies within the sources is exceedingly small and , as indicated below , their contribution to the secondary protons can be neglected , we assume that the energy is shared only between a  nucleon and a  fragment in proportion to their masses .",
    "note that only one pion production is considered .",
    "two pions production begins to contribute substantially at energies @xmath56  mev in the mirror system ( in which the nucleus is at rest ) , so this assumption is quite reasonable for interactions between nuclei with @xmath57 and cmb photons .",
    "lastly , we presume that protons and neutrons are produced equiprobably .    our problem can be formulated as a  chain of differential equations for the secondary nuclei resulting from an  initial one .",
    "all nonhomogeneous terms of any equation at a  given argument are defined if previous equations of the chain are already solved .",
    "let @xmath58 be the number of nuclei with charge  @xmath59 and mass number  @xmath30 at a  distance @xmath60 and @xmath61 be the reciprocal of the mean free path for a  reaction channel @xmath62 .",
    "we consider the following channels : photodisintegration with emitting one or more nucleons , @xmath63-particle , etc .",
    "( every isotope accounts for eight channels of photodisintegration on average ) , beta  decay and pion production",
    ". then change of the  nuclei flux with distance is described by the differential equation : @xmath64 where the  reciprocal of the  total mean free path takes on form @xmath65    the expression for @xmath61 in the case of a  nucleus propagating through isotropic background with differential density @xmath66 , is given by@xcite : @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the threshold energy in the  mirror system and @xmath69 is the cross section of the channel  @xmath62 .    the solution of eq",
    "can be represented by : @xmath70 where integrals in the last term are calculated with simpson s rule .",
    "this algorithm was used earlier in @xcite . as a  control ,",
    "we determine the total number of nucleons , which must be equal to the mass number of an  initial nucleus , at each integration step @xmath71 .",
    "accuracy of the test is better than @xmath72 for all distances of interest .",
    "we should emphasize that the solution procedure becomes more complicated if one includes also the energy losses due to pair production as the energy per nucleon does not conserve in this case .",
    "the dominant process at the energies in question , which affects protons during their propagation through intergalactic medium , is photoproduction of pions .",
    "for the reason stated above we consider production of only one pion . in this case",
    "the inelasticity coefficient can be derived analytically , given that the initial energy @xmath73 of a proton in the laboratory system and the energy @xmath74 of a photon in the mirror system are known .    at given @xmath73 a value of @xmath74 varies with both the photon energy @xmath75 and the proton ",
    "photon collision angle in the laboratory system .",
    "values of this angle are simulated from isotropic distribution .",
    "the distribution of @xmath74 follows from eq . :",
    "@xmath76    after specifying the photon energy @xmath74 , the energy and momentum of a  nucleon produced are calculated in the center  of  mass system .",
    "further they are used to determine the corresponding quantities in the laboratory system and to calculate the inelasticity coefficient . all formulae required",
    "can be found , for instance , in  @xcite .    thus applying monte ",
    "carlo simulation we can obtain a function @xmath77 which represents the probability that a proton with initial energy @xmath73 is localized in the range of @xmath31 after travelling a distance @xmath78 , and satisfies the normalization condition : @xmath79 the number of trial histories in our calculations is equal to @xmath80 .     at different travelled distances",
    "@xmath78 , with @xmath81ev and @xmath82ev .",
    "the values of points at energy @xmath73 are indicated on the right scale and give the probability that a  proton conserves its initial energy after propagating a distance @xmath78 . ]",
    "figure  [ wprot ] illustrates the probability function at @xmath83ev and different distances .",
    "the curves presented are smooth whereas they have pronounced peaks if mean values of the inelasticity coefficient are used .",
    "the calculation scheme presented above allows us to construct spectra of both primary ( i.e. accelerated at sources ) and secondary ( i.e. generated as a result of photodisintegration and photoproduction of heavy nuclei ) protons as well as spectra of nuclei at different distances from sources .",
    "first we consider the calculation procedure of the spectra produced by protons .",
    "the intensity of primary ones with energy @xmath84 at a distance @xmath78 can be derived from @xmath85 where @xmath86 is given by @xmath87 for energies @xmath88 , and @xmath89 otherwise , with @xmath90ev .",
    "this factor sets the number of particles in the injection spectrum at a given energy .    in the case of secondary protons the so - called source function",
    "is required : @xmath91 where @xmath92 yields the amount of the protons with energy @xmath93 , produced in travelling a distance @xmath60 by an initial nucleus @xmath94 with mass number @xmath95 .",
    "then their intensity is described  by @xmath96 and the total intensity is the sum over all nuclei accelerated : @xmath97 since the energy of the initial nucleus is @xmath95 times as great as that of the nucleons produced , the factor @xmath98 can be written as @xmath99 if @xmath100 , and @xmath101 otherwise .",
    "nuclei spectra can be constructed in a  similar way .",
    "it is conventional in cosmic rays physics to consider groups of nuclei . in our calculations",
    "we also combine them in several groups depending on their mass number .",
    "these are the helium group @xmath102 ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 ) and the groups @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 of light ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) , mean ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) , heavy ( @xmath113 , @xmath114 ) and very heavy ( @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) nuclei , respectively . here",
    "@xmath117 is the mean mass number .",
    "in fact each group at a  given energy @xmath118 contains nuclei with energies in the range of @xmath119 , where @xmath120 and @xmath121 are the minimal and maximum mass numbers of the group .",
    "nevertheless this procedure is quite justified as there exist substantial uncertainties in measuring energy and type of incoming uhecr particles .",
    "then the intensity of a  group @xmath122 is defined as @xmath123 where @xmath124 is the sum of values @xmath125 ( calculated according to eq . ) for the secondary nuclei with energy @xmath84 produced by an  initial particle @xmath94 at a  distance @xmath78 from its source and the index @xmath94 runs over all nuclei contributing to the group . for example , the group @xmath108 of very heavy nuclei includes particles which could be generated during propagation of @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 . for initial nucleus @xmath25 the value @xmath126",
    "consists of all terms between @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "the factor @xmath129 depends on the mean mass number @xmath130 of the group @xmath122 and is defined similarly to  with replacement of @xmath131 by @xmath132 .",
    "the  spectra obtained in this way are expressed in relative terms , with the total number of injected particles at @xmath90ev taken as unity .",
    "in this section we present spectra and mass composition of cosmic rays in the range of energies from @xmath6ev to @xmath133ev , produced by a  single source located at various distances  @xmath78 . though the cr spectrum is modified during propagation of the particles through the space , its shape at the observation level strongly depends on the injection index @xmath3 .",
    "figures [ sp26][sp46 ] illustrate the differential spectra of protons and nuclei groups , produced by the source with @xmath34 , 3.6 , 4.6 at @xmath134 , 40 , 100 , 400  mpc .",
    "the maximum acceleration energies of the particles are evaluated from eq . and . the total flux at @xmath135 is less than unity , which results from transition of more energetic protons to lower energies and disintegration of nuclei into fragments during propagation .    ,",

    "all these pictures have some common features .",
    "firstly , the helium group decays rapidly since the mean free path @xmath138 of these particles is small enough . besides , there is no essential replenishment from heavier nuclei .",
    "a  noticeable flattening in the spectrum of the @xmath102 group below @xmath139 arises from the change of dominance between two interaction mechanisms : photodisintegration and photopion production , accompanied by a  slight increase in @xmath138 . secondly , although nuclei of the @xmath105 group ( @xmath46 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) are absent at the source , they appear in small numbers in propagating of initial nuclei .",
    "thirdly , as discussed above , one can neglect the  contribution of heavier nuclei to the proton flux .",
    "the highest proton yield is supported by the @xmath102 group , as a  consequence of its fast decrease . as can be seen",
    ", the fluxes of all nuclei groups undergo the cutoff at sufficiently large distances from the source .",
    "this effect should be more pronounced if their absorption due to pair production is taken into account .    at a  given value of the injection index",
    "@xmath3 it is easy to estimate the cr composition .",
    "figure  [ comp ] demonstrates the energy dependence of the mean logarithmic mass of particles composing the aforementioned total spectra : @xmath142 where @xmath122 runs over all nuclei groups , including protons . as can be seen",
    ", the larger is @xmath3 , the heavier is the uhecr composition , especially at energies below @xmath44ev .",
    "[sp46 ] . ]",
    "when calculating spectra , we make a  simple assumption that all nearby sources are identical in cosmic  ray intensity as well as in composition and acceleration conditions for particles .",
    "therefore the contribution of a  single source located at a  distance @xmath78 to the total flux should be taken into account with weight @xmath143 .",
    "then the average distance to the nearby sources is close to 9  mpc . in this case",
    "the uhecr spectrum is modified only slightly and resembles the result obtained for a  single source located at a  distance of 5  mpc .    , 3.6 , and 4.6",

    "a  comparison with the hires broken power law fit shows that there is no break in the spectrum at @xmath34 , which is the most appropriate for light composition . in  addition",
    ", the spectra at @xmath34 and 3.6 do not reveal sufficient suppression .",
    "it is evident that in the case of short distances the suppression of the uhecr spectrum can arise rather due to acceleration limits at the sources than as a  result of interactions of cr particles with intergalactic background photons .",
    "hence the spectral break at the gzk threshold @xmath144 may be attained if we take it as the maximum acceleration energy of some nuclei group .",
    "the group , of course , should be dominant at energies below @xmath144 to keep the break in the total spectrum at the observation level . according to the hires results @xcite , the gzk cutoff starts from approximately @xmath145ev and the broken power law fit yields indices of roughly 2.8 and 5.4 below and above it , respectively .",
    "the auger spectrum also testifies for the cr flux suppression but its fit has a  smooth shape @xcite . in order to reproduce the spectral break and light composition simultaneously in the calculated spectra at lower @xmath3",

    "below all results are obtained with the assumption of these new maximum acceleration energies .",

    "there is no possibility to describe the experimental data of both facilities in the framework of one model .",
    "hopefully , this discrepancy will be overcome after the models used for the comparison undergo necessary modifications in response to the lhc data . however , if we compare experimental values of @xmath151 , it is evident that the hires composition is lighter than the auger one at ultrahigh energies .",
    "according to our calculations , the composition at @xmath157 seems to be a  mixture of protons and light nuclei such as helium , up to @xmath158ev , which is consistent with the hires data . at higher energies it grows gradually heavier .",
    "in contrast , the composition at @xmath159 is compatible with the auger results .",
    "thus one can conclude tentatively that mass composition measurements make it possible to distinguish between different values of the injection index .",
    "though , at the moment several models of hadron interactions are used and their predictions concerning the shower maximum depth dependence on energy differ significantly .",
    "the necessity of nearby sources of uhecr nuclei has been discussed during the last few years . as it was mentioned above , seyfert galaxies located at distances of @xmath1  mpc were suggested as probable sources of uhecrs @xcite .",
    "the correlation between the arrival directions of ultrahigh  energy events and agns within 75  mpc was found in the auger data @xcite .",
    "specific quantitative constraints on the uhecr source population were obtained in  @xcite . for uniformly distributed sources with pure silicon or iron composition and intermediate cutoff energies ( @xmath160ev for iron nuclei ) , the authors found that the lack of nearby sources makes impossible to get a  good agreement with the auger data and that the nearest sources have to be within 60  mpc and 80  mpc for silicon and iron sources , respectively .",
    "( the left panel ) and 4.3 ( the right panel ) .",
    "the description of this figure is the same as that of figure  [ source_sp ] . ]    in our work we considered seyfert galaxies at distances of @xmath1  mpc as sources of uhecrs and found that it is possible to describe both hires and auger measurements , varying the injection index  @xmath3 .",
    "moreover , diverting from the specific type of sources , we calculated the energy spectra and mass composition of particles produced by sources uniformly distributed within a  spherical layer from 1  mpc to 40  mpc , with all other factors being the same .",
    "as can be seen from figures  [ disunif_comp ] and [ uniform_sp ] , there is also an agreement with the experimental data provided by the facilities , so the results obtained are not too sensitive to the distribution form of the nearby sources .",
    "it is worthwhile mentioning that our calculations are performed in the framework of the widespread notion that the influence of extragalactic magnetic fields ( egmf ) on the propagation of uhecr particles can be neglected .",
    "the same assumption is mandatory for identifying the highest energy events recorded by hires and auger with astrophysical objects .",
    "in fact , larmor radius at @xmath44ev exceeds 400  mpc even for iron nuclei in homogeneous magnetic fields below @xmath161 g .",
    "however , there is no generally accepted opinion concerning egmf .",
    "the influence of random magnetic fields with @xmath162 g and a  coherence scale of 1  mpc was considered in @xcite .",
    "the authors found no additional constraints on the upper bound imposed on the  nearest sources distances .",
    "but if the magnetic field is significantly stronger ( @xmath163 g ) then the uhecr sources must be located at distances of a  few  mpc , with the only appropriate candidate being the nearest active radio galaxy cena  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the propagation of uhecr particles in the intergalactic medium from sources to the earth and obtained their spectra and mass composition in the energy range of @xmath0ev , based on the following assumptions : the uhecr sources are considered to be seyfert galaxies located within the radius of @xmath164  mpc ; mass composition of the particles at the sources resembles space content ; relations between maximum energies of different nuclei are retained according to the acceleration model suggested for moderate ",
    "power sources ; generation spectra obey an inverse power law with arbitrary index @xmath3 .",
    "the higher is the value of  @xmath3 , the heavier is the composition of nuclei accelerated . over a  hundred isotopes arising due to interactions with background photons",
    "are taken into account .",
    "our calculations have shown that the  conjecture of nearby sources located at distances of less than 40  mpc is compatible with the hires and auger experimental data .",
    "although these data are contradictory , it has been possible to represent them in the framework of a  unifying approach with varying injection index .",
    "it is worth noting that our results depend crucially on the model parameters .",
    "we hope that a  larger number of uhecr events , which should be available in the near future , will allow to examine generation spectra at sources in more detail .",
