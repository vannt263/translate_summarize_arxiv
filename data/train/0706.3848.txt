    "we show that in that case , minimum sum colorings have a convenient property that can be exploited in a fast algorithm .",
    "this algorithm first color a uniform multicycle contained in @xmath2 such that the remaining edges of @xmath2 form a ( possibly unconnected ) multipath .",
    "this multipath is then colored separately .",
    "+ we begin this section by the following result on multipaths .",
    "we consider multipaths with vertices labeled @xmath188 , such that edges are only between vertices of the form @xmath189 .",
    "[ lmpath ] there always exists a minimum sum edge coloring @xmath8 of a multipath @xmath190 , such that its color classes @xmath97 are maximum matchings in the graphs @xmath191 ; furthermore these matchings contain all the edges appearing in odd position from left to right in each connected component of @xmath192 .",
    "assume that @xmath193 is the minimum positive integer for which @xmath97 is not a maximum matching of the graph @xmath194 .",
    "notice that the edges in @xmath192 have a color at least equal to @xmath95 .",
    "let @xmath81 be the size of a maximum matching in @xmath192 .",
    "we first suppose that @xmath192 is connected . by hypothesis , we have that @xmath195 .",
    "we consider a maximal sequence of consecutive vertices in @xmath192 , say @xmath196 , such that one of the edges between vertices @xmath197 and @xmath198 is colored by @xmath8 with color @xmath95 , with @xmath199 .",
    "if vertex @xmath200 is the second vertex in @xmath192 , then we can recolor the edges of @xmath192 as follows .",
    "let @xmath201 be any color appearing on the edges between @xmath202 and @xmath200 .",
    "we recolor such an edge of color @xmath203 with color @xmath95 and color the edge between vertices @xmath200 and @xmath204 of color @xmath95 with color @xmath203 .",
    "now , for each @xmath205 , with @xmath206 , we recolor the edge @xmath207 of color @xmath95 with a color @xmath208 appearing on the edges @xmath209 , and color the edge @xmath209 of color @xmath208 with color @xmath95 . the color @xmath208 is chosen such that @xmath210 if color @xmath211 appears on edges @xmath209 , and it is any color appearing on edges @xmath209 otherwise . at the end of this process , we have two cases .",
    "( i ) color @xmath212 appears on the edges between vertices @xmath213 and @xmath214 . in this case , recoloring the edge @xmath215 of color @xmath212 with color @xmath95 , we obtain a new proper edge coloring of @xmath192 whose sum is less than the one induced by @xmath8 , which is a contradiction .",
    "( ii ) color @xmath212 does not appear on the edges @xmath215 . in this case , recoloring any edge between vertices @xmath213 and @xmath214 with color @xmath95 , we obtain again a contradiction to the optimality of @xmath8 .    if sequence @xmath216 begins at the @xmath205th vertex of @xmath192 , with @xmath217 , we can assign color @xmath95 to an edge between vertices @xmath218 , and to an edge between vertices @xmath219 , and so on , until the new sequence begins at the first or second vertex of @xmath192 .",
    "if it begins at the second vertex of @xmath192 , we apply the above recoloring procedure .",
    "hence the sequence @xmath216 must begin at the first vertex of @xmath192 .",
    "if another , disjoint , such sequence follows sequence @xmath216 in @xmath192 , by using a similar recoloring argument , we can merge these two sequences , obtaining again a contradiction to the optimality of @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , @xmath220 , and @xmath97 contains all the edges appearing at odd positions from left to right in @xmath192 .    finally , if @xmath192 is unconnected , the same reasoning can be applied to each connected component of @xmath192 .    from lemma",
    "[ lmpath ] , we can deduce the following result , that settles the case of multipaths .    [ proppath ] the greedy algorithm that iteratively picks a maximum matching formed by all edges appearing in odd position in each connected component of a multipath @xmath190 , computes a minimum edge sum coloring of @xmath190 in time @xmath27 .",
    "we now consider the case of even multicycles .",
    "we assume that the vertices in the multicycle @xmath2 on @xmath221 vertices are labelled clockwise with integers @xmath222 , and arithmetic operations are taken modulo @xmath0 . for each @xmath223 , we recall that @xmath186 denotes the number of parallel edges between two consecutive vertices @xmath95 and @xmath224 in @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath225 be a positive integer .",
    "a multicycle @xmath2 with @xmath226 edges is called _ @xmath225-uniform _ if @xmath227 for every @xmath95 such that @xmath223 .",
    "[ lmmv1 ] let @xmath2 be a multicycle of even length and let @xmath228 .",
    "let @xmath8 be any minimum sum edge coloring of @xmath2 .",
    "then , @xmath8 can be transformed into another minimum sum edge coloring @xmath46 such that the first @xmath229 color classes @xmath97 induced by @xmath46 , with @xmath230 , are such that @xmath220 and their union induces a @xmath225-uniform multicycle .",
    "let @xmath8 be any minimum sum edge coloring of @xmath2 , with @xmath187 for some integer @xmath231 .",
    "clearly , as @xmath8 is minimum , we have that @xmath232 .",
    "let us consider the following claim .",
    "[ clmv1 ] the coloring @xmath8 can be transformed into a minimum sum edge coloring @xmath46 having the property that the edges colored with colors @xmath84 and @xmath85 induce a subgraph of @xmath2 isomorphic to an cycle .",
    "notice that , by using claim [ clmv1 ] , the lemma follows directly by induction on @xmath225 .",
    "so , in order to prove claim [ clmv1 ] , first notice that , by using a similar recoloring argument as in the proof of lemma [ lmpath ] , we can deduce that @xmath233 .    now , without loss of generality , assume that @xmath8 is such that there is an edge colored with color @xmath84 between vertices @xmath234 and @xmath235 for each @xmath205 with @xmath236 .",
    "moreover , let @xmath237 be the minimum color appearing on the edges between vertices @xmath235 and @xmath238 , for all @xmath236 .",
    "suppose that there exists a maximal sequence @xmath239 of consecutive vertices in @xmath2 , such that colors @xmath84 and @xmath240 belong to the set of colors assigned by @xmath8 to the edges between vertices @xmath241 and @xmath242 , with @xmath199 .",
    "then by using the same recoloring argument as in the proof of lemma  [ lmpath ] , we can move color @xmath240 in order to transform such a sequence into a @xmath243-path . moreover , again by using the same recoloring argument as in the proof of lemma  [ lmpath ] , we can deduce that @xmath244 .",
    "so , if @xmath245 we are done , otherwise , we can swap the colors @xmath85 and @xmath240 so that @xmath246 and @xmath247 induce a cycle .",
    "there exists an @xmath27-time algorithm for computing a minimum sum edge coloring of @xmath2 of a multicycle of even length with @xmath23 edges .",
    "let @xmath221 be the number of vertices in @xmath2 and let @xmath248 , for @xmath223 .",
    "for each @xmath236 , assign to @xmath225 edges between vertices @xmath234 and @xmath249 the odd colors @xmath250 and assign to @xmath225 edges between vertices @xmath249 and @xmath251 the even colors @xmath252 .",
    "the previous @xmath253 colored edges induce a subgraph of @xmath2 isomorphic to a @xmath225-uniform multicycle .",
    "when removing this @xmath225-uniform multicycle from @xmath2 , we obtain a multipath or a set of disjoint multipaths , the edges of which can be colored with colors in @xmath254 , from proposition  [ proppath ] .",
    "such a coloring can be computed in @xmath27 time , and by lemmas  [ lmmv1 ] and  [ lmpath ] , it is a minimum sum edge coloring of @xmath2 .",
    "in the generalized optimal cost chromatic partition problem  @xcite , each color has an integer cost , but this cost is not necessarily equal to the color itself .",
    "the cost of a vertex coloring is @xmath255 , where @xmath256 is the cost of color @xmath95 . for any set of costs ,",
    "our proofs can be generalized to show that on one hand , the minimum number of colors needed in a minimum cost edge coloring of @xmath2 is equal to @xmath6 when @xmath2 is bipartite or a multicycle , and on the other hand that a minimum cost coloring can be computed in @xmath25 time for multicycles .",
    "in fact , our results can be generalized to a much larger class of minimum cost edge coloring problems . given an edge coloring @xmath257",
    ", we define a cost @xmath258 of the form : @xmath259 where @xmath260 is a real function of a color @xmath95 and an integer @xmath81 , and @xmath261 is the set of edges @xmath262 such that @xmath263 .",
    "hence the cost to minimize is a sum of the cost of each color class , itself defined as some function of the color and the size of the color class .    in the minimum sum coloring problem , the function @xmath240 is defined by @xmath264    we further suppose that the functions @xmath265 satisfy the following property :    given two nonincreasing integer sequences @xmath266 and @xmath267 such that @xmath268 we have @xmath269    this property clearly holds in the minimum sum coloring problem .",
    "it formalizes the fact that when minimizing the cost @xmath258 , we are looking for a distribution of the color class sizes that is as nonuniform as possible . in particular , when an element ( edge or vertex ) in a color class @xmath95 is recolored with a color @xmath270 , whose class is larger , then the objective function decreases .",
    "this is the argument that we implicitly used in our proof of theorem  [ thbe ] .",
    "it is also the argument that ensures the correctness of the algorithms .",
    "property  ( [ jungle ] ) can also be shown to hold ( see  @xcite ) when the following two conditions are satisfied :    1 .",
    "@xmath271 , that is , when the cost of a class only depends on its size , in which case we will say that the functions are _ separable _ , 2 .   the functions @xmath272 are concave .",
    "this is the case for instance in the minimum entropy edge coloring problem  @xcite , for which @xmath273 .",
    "a number of other coloring problems falling in that class were recently studied by fukunaga , halldrsson , and nagamochi  @xcite .",
    "+ for all minimum cost edge coloring problems whose objective function satisfies  ( [ jungle ] ) , all our results apply .",
    "in fact , the colorings that we compute are _ robust _ colorings , in the sense that they minimize every objective function satisfying the above property .",
