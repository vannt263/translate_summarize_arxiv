    "different branches correspond to different landau levels ( as indexed ) that happen to cross first.,width=321 ]    with this process of determining @xmath168 , it is natural to investigate the optimal model parameters for a large critical field , as a guidance for future device fabrication . for a generic group of model parameters ,",
    "the above process is rather tedious , because of the strongly nonlinear and discontinuous dependence of @xmath168 on these parameters . to extract more insights from eq .",
    ", we present the parameter - dependences of the critical magnetic field in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] and fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] .",
    "the critical field is plotted as a function of the model parameter @xmath180 in fig .",
    "[ figure4](a ) . for a sufficiently large @xmath180",
    ", the critical field is determined by the crossing point of two landau levels of @xmath181 , i.e. , @xmath182 .",
    "when @xmath180 decreases , @xmath178 increases , but the critical field decreases quickly if other parameters remains unchanged . in fig .",
    "[ figure4](b ) , the critical field increases quickly when the parameter @xmath164 decreases .",
    "the critical field reaches at a maximal value @xmath183 when @xmath184 .",
    "we notice that the critical field is very sensitive to model parameters @xmath164 and @xmath185 , and can be as large as tens of teslas . as for @xmath46 , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ figure5 ] , the first observation is that the critical field increases with @xmath46 monotonically for a landau level crossing with a specific index @xmath178 .",
    "increasing @xmath46 leads to a band crossing of landau levels with a higher index , which corresponds to a larger critical magnetic field @xmath168 .",
    "the zeeman coupling can destroy the qshe in an alternative way . for a perpendicular zeeman field",
    ", the hamiltonian has an additional term @xmath186 ( @xmath35 is a @xmath36 identity matrix ) and @xmath2 is still a good quantum number . the main effect of this type of zeeman coupling to the bhz model is the change of the gap in @xmath30 : @xmath187 no matter what sign of the gap and the zeeman field , the zeeman field always induces a topological transition to a quantum anomalous hall effect at @xmath188 according to the formula of the chern number . when @xmath189 , one is @xmath96 while another one is @xmath190 or @xmath16@xcite .",
    "thus the total hall conductance becomes quantized in unit of @xmath191 .",
    "of course the combined effect of the zeeman field and the orbital motion may change the critical values of the magnetic field when the @xmath1 factor is not negligible .",
    "so far we just consider the case that two spin - component @xmath37 and @xmath38 are decoupled such that the spin chern numbers are well defined .",
    "when @xmath2 is no longer a good quantum number , the problem becomes more subtle and delicate@xcite .",
    "for example , when the rashba spin - orbit coupling and the zeeman coupling co - exist in the kane - mele model for qshe , the helical edge states may open a tiny sub - gap @xcite , which clearly indicates the breaking down of the robust quantum spin hall transport . in the case",
    "it is understandable since there is no additional symmetry to protect the qshe .",
    "the in - plane zeeman field may couple two spin - components such that we could nt calculate the spin chern numbers as we did in the previous sections .",
    "it is still unclear whether or not there exists a hidden symmetry similar to @xmath2 after proper transformation such that we could define two `` spin''-dependent chern numbers or the zeeman coupling is relatively negligible .",
    "this will be a subject we need to study further . in the experiment by du et al@xcite",
    "the conductance is quantized while the fermi level sweeps the whole band gap by tuning the gate voltage .",
    "the quantum plateau is also robust up to an 8 t perpendicular field and a 12 t in - plane magnetic field .",
    "any sub - gap of order of @xmath192mev in the edge states ( if exists ) should be measurable at low temperatures ( tens mk ) by sweeping the fermi level or the gate voltage .",
    "one possible explanation is that the rashba - like spin orbit coupling between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is negligible , and that the edge states are robust with respect to the @xmath2 symmetry . in this case",
    "the chern numbers in @xmath37 and @xmath38 are still well defined in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "another possibility is that the strong disorder effect suppresses the spin - orbit coupling . in the experiment",
    "the mobility gap and the quantum plateau of conductance coexist , indicating the occurrence of the anderson localization for the bulk electrons .",
    "this is a clear signature of topological anderson insulator @xcite .",
    "thus the disorder may stabilize the qshe in the system .",
    "more studies are expected alone this direction in the future .",
    "in general , when time reversal symmetry is broken , the edge states may open a sub - gap even if there is no bulk band gap closing , which is different from topological quantum phase transition when the symmetry is invariant .",
    "for instance the zero end modes in the the su - schrieffer - heeger model with the chirality symmetry move away from the zero energy to the bulk band when a staggered on - site potential is introduced , which breaks the chirality symmetry . in this case",
    "the bulk gap never closes even when the end modes move into the bulk bands .",
    "this is a key to understand the thouless charge pumping in the rice - mele model@xcite .",
    "in short , the quantum spin hall effect can persist up to a strong magnetic field when @xmath2 is a good quantum number . in this case the spin - dependent chern number is well defined in each subspace , and according to the bulk - edge correspondence@xcite , the helical edge states are robust to an external field .",
