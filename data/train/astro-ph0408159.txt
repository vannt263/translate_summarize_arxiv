    "our early picture of galaxy clusters , as simple , dynamically relaxed systems , has been changed dramatically over the past decade by x - ray images taken with the einstein observatory , rosat , bbxrt , and asca .",
    "these images show that galaxy clusters are complex systems with extensive substructure and mergers on time sales of @xmath15 years .",
    "( see e.g. forman et  al .",
    "2001 , 2002 and references therein ) .",
    "the excellent angular resolution of the chandra x - ray observatory made possible the detailed study of these substructures , particularly near the centers of clusters , revealing surprising new signatures for their interactions .",
    "notably ram pressure stripping of subcluster gas due to its motion through the intracluster medium ( icm ) was found to produce prominant x - ray surface brightness discontinuities from cold fronts ( dense surviving subcluster cores ) , rather than from the shocked gas also expected from such motion ( forman et  al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ; vikhlinin et  al .  2001 ; markevitch et  al .",
    "2000 ; heinz et  al .  2003 ) .",
    "furthermore , high quality x - ray measurements of the geometry and gas properties along the interface between the cold front and the icm were used to determine the dynamical motion of the cold front through the cluster ( vikhlinin et  al .",
    "2001 ; mazzotta et  al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "galaxies in these dynamically rich cluster environments are subject to both tidal and hydrodynamical interactions that significantly affect their evolution ( see , gnedin 2003 ; acreman et  al .",
    "2003 and references therein ) .",
    "the chandra x - ray observatory has also made possible detailed studies of hot gas in member galaxies of nearby clusters in interaction with each other and their gaseous environment .",
    "just as in the case of larger cluster substructure , the action of ram pressure acting on gas within an individual galaxy due to the galaxy s motion through the icm produces sharp x - ray surface brightness discontinuities along the galaxy s leading edge associated with cold fronts , as well as trailing wakes and comet - like debris tails of gas swept from the infalling system ( e.g. see forman et  al .  1979 ,",

    "2004 for c153 in abell 2125 ) .",
    "thus , in addition to elucidating the hydrodynamics of ram pressure stripping itself , high quality x - ray measurements of the geometry of these features combined with measurements of the gas temperatures , abundances , and densities along the interface between the cold front and the icm may be used to constrain the three dimensional ( transverse as well as radial ) motion of the galaxy through the cluster ( dosaj et  al .",

    "in this paper we present this analysis for one such galaxy , ngc  1404 ( shown in figure [ fig : fornax ] ) , that is undergoing ram pressure stripping as it falls inwards towards the fornax cluster center in the direction of the dominant elliptical galaxy ngc  1399 . both ngc  1399 and ngc  1404",

    "there are several possible solutions to this dilemma .",
    "first , ngc  1404 and ngc  1399 may not both lie in the plane of the sky .",
    "ngc  1404 may be undergoing a fly - by of the dominant elliptical , with a non - negligible impact parameter rather than a direct collision , such that the use of the projected distance between the galaxies underestimates the physical radial distance between them and overestimates the value of the cluster electron density at the edge .",
    "thus the density jump should be viewed as a lower bound on the physical density discontinuity , mach number , and relative velocity of ngc  1404 with respect to the intracluster gas .",
    "a second possibility is that ngc  1399 is moving with respect to the fornax icm and may , itself , be experiencing ram pressure stripping due to this motion ( paolillo et  al .",
    "2002 ) . then the optically measured relative radial velocity between the two galaxies may not accurately reflect the relative radial velocity between ngc  1404 and the surrounding cluster gas .    despite these uncertainties",
    "it is useful to consider what our analysis implies for the increased temperature and density expected in the stagnation region . for the subsonic motion ( @xmath235 )",
    "found for model pl+icm1 and using the cluster free stream as the reference region , bernoulli s equation predicts a density increase of @xmath236 leading to a surface brightness enhancement by a factor of @xmath237 .",
    "this is consistent with the possible @xmath238 surface brightness enhancement seen justoutside the edge in figure [ fig : sbprof ] .",
    "the temperature in the stagnation region would be expected to rise by @xmath239 by adiabatic compression to @xmath240kev . however , the stagnation region is small ( of the order of a galaxy diameter ) such that the observed temperature would be lower because of dilution by cooler cluster gas along the line of sight .",
    "our measurements for the temperature in this region hint of a possible temperature rise consistent with such adiabatic heating , but our errors are too large because of limited statistics for a definitive measurement . for model pl+icm2 ( @xmath241 )",
    "the temperature and density behind the shock would be expected to increase by @xmath242 and @xmath243 , respectively , with temperature and density in the stagnation region similar to that for model pl+icm1 .",
    "such a weak shock would not be expected to be seen in our data .",
    "in this paper we have used data from three chandra observations using the acis array ( a @xmath38  ksec exposure with chips s2 and s3 taken on 18 - 19 january 2000 , a @xmath40ks exposure using chip s3 taken on 13 february 2003 , and a @xmath41ks exposure using the acis - i array taken on 28 - 29 may 2003 ) of the elliptical galaxy ngc  1404 falling toward the dominant elliptical galaxy ngc  1399 in the fornax cluster to bound the relative physical motion of ngc  1404 with respect to the fornax cluster icm . we find :    1 .",
    "the temperature and abundance of the galaxy gas just inside the edge in ngc  1404 is @xmath89kev and @xmath244 , typical of elliptical galaxies .",
    "gas temperatures for the cluster gas in the free - stream region ( w1 ) and region next to the edge containing the stagnation point ( w0 ) are @xmath100kev and @xmath96kev , respectively , with a cluster abundance @xmath245 measured in w1 .",
    "2 .   the x - ray emissivity in ngc  1404 is more than a factor @xmath86 greater than that of the surrounding cluster gas .",
    "since the x - ray emissivity is dominated by line emission in cool , metal rich galaxies , high quality abundance measurements in galaxies are crucial for determining the density discontinuity across the edge and constraints on the dynamical motion of the galaxy through the icm from these edge analyses .",
    "3 .   the surface brightness profile in ngc  1404 in the direction towards ngc  1399 obeys a power law for @xmath246 , a break at @xmath130kpc , and a sharp edge where the surface brightness decreases by more than an order of magnitude over @xmath247kpc . outside the edge",
    "the surface brightness profile is consistent with cluster gas with a possible @xmath248 enhancement at @xmath136kpc .",
    "the best fit edge position is found to be at @xmath249kpc from the center of the edge - bounding ellipse with a weak dependence on the large distance behavior of the cluster gas density .",
    "a single power law density model within ngc  1404 provides a poor fit to the data for @xmath250kpc . the surface brightness profile across the edge is well modelled with a power law electron density in ngc  1404 with index @xmath173 ( beta model index @xmath174 ) for @xmath246 , a break at @xmath130kpc after which @xmath167 flattens to @xmath251 with a weak dependence on the beta model parameters assumed for the cluster gas .",
    "the sharpness of the edge is consistent with a jump - like density discontinuity with electron density in ngc  1404 inside the edge of @xmath7@xmath8and in the cluster free stream region of @xmath252@xmath8 .",
    "the pressure jump , @xmath253 , between the cluster free stream region and gas at the edge implies a mach number @xmath254 relative to gas in the cluster free stream region and thus a velocity @xmath255kms@xmath13for ngc  1404 through the surrounding icm .",
    "this motion predicts an enhancement in the surface brightness of the cluster gas in the stagnation region by a factor @xmath237 due to adiabatic compression , consistent with that seen .",
    "using values for the relative radial velocity between ngc  1404 and ngc  1399 drawn from the literature as representative of the relative radial velocity between ngc  1404 and the surrounding cluster gas , the inferred value for the inclination angle of the motion with respect to the plane of the sky is large , @xmath256 , in apparent contradiction with the observed sharpness of the edge .",
    "this may signal the presence of a significant impact parameter between ngc  1404 and ngc  1399 or that ngc  1399 is also moving radially with respect to the cluster gas .",
