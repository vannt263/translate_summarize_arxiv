    "recent developments in quantum technology have brought us a capability of manipulating and measuring a quantum system larger than two qubits using a number of different physical systems .",

    "is state tomography . with state tomography",
    ", we can reconstruct the density matrix of the system . since the density matrix contains all the information of the quantum state we have , we are able in principal to calculate any characteristic of the system .",
    "the only problem is that the larger system gets , the exponentially more elements we have to measure and compute to characterize the system , and the analysis of the quantum nature of a state quickly becomes intractable .",
    "fortunately , there has been some recent progress in state characterization and visualization .",
    "a tomographic method for large systems with certain symmetries  @xcite , and a state visualization method for discrete systems that extends the wigner function  @xcite have been developed . by contrast , for qunats ( continuous variables ) a long history exists for establishing a tool set that efficiently represents and analyzes quantum states in an infinite - dimensional hilbert space . in particular ,",
    "the standard method in quantum optics is based on mapping operator functions to corresponding @xmath2-number functions .",
    "for example , the wigner function  @xcite , q - function  @xcite , and p - function  @xcite , which have been widely used in both theoretical and experimental analysis , are all @xmath2-number functions using coherent states .",

    "they are successfully used to analyze atoms in a trap  @xcite and spin - squeezed states of two - component bose - einstein condensates  @xcite . however , the main obstacle in using this state representation is the difficulty in adopting its composite structure into the analysis of the quantum system .",
    "for example , in quantum information processing , it is important to maintain the properties dependent on the composite structure of the system ; quantities such as entanglement only have meaning with it . to accommodate a more detailed system structure",

    "the quantum number @xmath16 defines the dimension @xmath8 of the representation , hence the system size is given as @xmath21 we will revisit this and explicitly define the coherent states with an euler angle parametrization  @xcite in section  [ gencs ] .",
    "using @xmath22 coherent states , a winger function has recently been constructed  @xcite .",
    "more general @xmath1-symmetric distribution functions have been shown to exist  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the q - function can be generalized rather straightforwardly with these coherent state , however no general quasi - probability functions are constructed using the coherent states defined in  . in this paper , we construct wigner and p - functions for @xmath1 in both the @xmath23 and @xmath24 cases .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first review the construction and properties of our generalized coherent states and then show how they help build a @xmath1-symmetric wigner function , q - function , and p - function through the stratonovich - weyl correspondence  @xcite .",
    "we then discuss some general properties of the functions and then conclude with an example .",
    "we start by explicitly defining our @xmath1 coherent states for @xmath8-dimensional systems , where @xmath8 is given in  .",
    "first we denote the @xmath1 generators  @xcite by the set @xmath25 this set is made up of off - diagonal generators @xmath26 and diagonal generators @xmath27 a detailed procedure to construct these matrices and their properties is given in  [ lambda ] .",
    "when @xmath28 , i.  e.  @xmath23 , the representation is fundamental and the generators above reduce to the generalized gell - mann matrices @xmath29 for @xmath1  @xcite . in particular ,",

    "more generally , since we are looking at the lowest weight state as the reference state , @xmath1 coherent states for @xmath8-dimensional systems can be easily shown to be equal to the @xmath8-th column of @xmath48 , @xmath49_{d}.\\ ] ] this is easy to see when @xmath48 and @xmath10 are represented in matrix form .",

    "the only elements of the matrix @xmath48 that are therefore relevant are those in the @xmath8-th column .",
    "if , on the other hand , we had chosen the highest weight state as the reference state , the resulting coherent state would be the first column of @xmath48 i.  e.  @xmath50_{1}$ ] .",

    "lastly , to recover the density matrix , the relation @xmath92 has to be satisfied .",
    "as we have seen in the beginning , the generalized q - function is rather easy to construct , however the wigner and p - functions are somewhat more complicated .",
    "thus , we will first look into the @xmath23 case for arbitrary @xmath1 systems .",

    "therefore , despite the apparent differences between expressions ,   is the appropriate generalization of   to @xmath114 .",
    "in this section , we mainly discuss two issues : the graphical representation of states of @xmath0-level systems using our distribution functions and the correspondence relation between the various distribution functions .",
    "first , we show some examples of the graphical representation for a @xmath125 system by considering a werner state  @xcite of two qubits , @xmath126 here the parameter @xmath127 defines the purity of the state",
    ". in particular @xmath128 corresponds a pure state whereas @xmath129 gives the completely mixed state .",
    "evaluating @xmath130 via   gives us @xmath131 which can be substituted into   to yield @xmath132 - ( 1 - 6 \\cos[2 \\theta_1 ] \\cos[\\theta_2]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ \\fl & \\,\\,- 3\\cos[2 \\theta_2 ] - 12 \\cos[\\phi_1-\\phi_2 ] \\sin[\\theta_1]\\sin[2 \\theta_2 ] ) \\sin[\\theta_3]^2\\biggr ) \\omega(s)\\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath133 is as defined in   with @xmath134 , i.  e.  @xmath135 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 .",
    "the function given in   is expressed in a five - parameter space , thus it is not easy to represent its entire property in one figure .",
    "so , we take cross sections of the function . to do this efficiently ,",
    "we look at the element of the phases @xmath138 and @xmath139 in  , that is @xmath140 $ ] .",
    "this element is effectively one parameter ( @xmath141 ) , so we can set it to have two extreme cases : @xmath142 and @xmath143 . doing this gives @xmath144 - ( 1 - 6 \\cos[2 \\theta_1 ] \\cos[\\theta_2]^2 \\nonumber \\\\ \\fl & \\,\\,- 3\\cos[2 \\theta_2 ] \\mp 12 \\sin[\\theta_1]\\sin[2 \\theta_2 ] ) \\sin[\\theta_3]^2\\biggr ) \\omega(s)\\biggr\\}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] figures  [ fig2a ] and  [ fig2b ] show the parameter regions where these quasi - distribution functions exhibit negative values for both cases @xmath142 and @xmath143 respectively .",
    "as we expect , the q - function does not yield negative values in the entire parameter regime , however when the states are pure enough , the p - function and the wigner function can be negative . when the purity of the werner state , indicated by @xmath127 , becomes small enough , i.  e.  when the state is more mixed , the parameter regime for the negative value disappears .",
    "in fact , the p - function can be negative when @xmath145 , while the wigner function shows a negative region when @xmath146 . such negativity in these quasi - distribution functions",
    "is often considered evidence of quantum nature in the states , however , our results indicates such a simple explanation does not apply to @xmath1 systems .     and various values of @xmath127 .",
    "the three plots at far left show the case of the completely mixed state with @xmath129 and the far right ones plot the pure state with @xmath128 .",
    "the value of @xmath127 for each plot is at right of the graphic .",
    "the colored areas represent those values of @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 where the corresponding function is negative . ]     and various values of @xmath127 .",
    "the three plots at far left show the case of the completely mixed state with @xmath129 and the far right ones plot the pure state with @xmath128 .",

    "the colored areas represent those values of @xmath147 , @xmath148 , and @xmath149 where the corresponding function is negative . ]",
    "there are of course other ways to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space .",
    "the optimality of a representation is dependent on the properties we are after .",
    "taking a cross section is the easiest way to generate a graphical representation to discern rough properties of the state .",
    "next , we briefly discuss the correspondence between different distribution functions .",
    "as we mentioned before , the concrete expression of the various distribution functions depends on the parametrization of the @xmath1 group operators . in this paper",
    ", we employed the parametrization given in  @xcite , which is an extension of the ones used for @xmath7 and @xmath22 .",
    "this parametrization gives us a way to write out the wigner function , q - function , and p - function that , in the @xmath23 and @xmath114 cases , makes their correspondence easy to see .",
    "furthermore , it shows us how more general @xmath16 representations should be related .    to begin , for the @xmath23 case , we start by making the following redefinition of  , @xmath150 such that @xmath151 is true .",
    "this can only be done because our @xmath133 terms in   are all positive definite . using   and   we therefore get @xmath152 from this we can see how we can convert between the various @xmath153 operators and , through  , the various @xmath154 .",
    "a similar procedure can be done for the @xmath114 case . in detail , following   we redefine   to give us @xmath155 by construction , @xmath156 is non - singular and of rank @xmath8 .",
    "it is therefore invertible , allowing us to have @xmath157 this allows us to state ( via  ) that @xmath158 where we have made the following definition : @xmath159 .",
    "conversion between the various @xmath160 via   is now straightforward .    in general",
    ", we can see that the transformation sequence between the various functions in the general @xmath16 case is equivalent to   if we make the following definition : @xmath161 .",
    "for example , when @xmath23 , @xmath162 reduces to @xmath163 as expected .    to conclude , in this paper we have given an explicit set of @xmath1-symmetric functions that represent finite - dimensional versions of the wigner function , q - function and p - function by using generalized coherent state . in the case of the general @xmath16 @xmath7 and @xmath23 @xmath22 representations ,",
    "these functions are equivalent to previously derived finite - dimensional wigner , q- , and p - functions with an appropriate parameter change  @xcite .",
    "the quasi - probability distribution functions in this paper have been generalized to a higher quantum number @xmath114 .",
    "such quasi - probability distribution functions may also have some benefits to characterize qubit - qunat systems .",
    "these hybrid systems are becoming extensively investigated in the context of quantum information devices . for more complex systems , there are possibilities to further generalize the formula to an arbitrary @xmath16 .",
    "however , the analysis has showed that the process is not as straightforward as the @xmath7 case  @xcite and further work will be necessary to complete the generalization .",
