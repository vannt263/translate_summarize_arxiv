    "dynamical studies have established that supermassive black holes , with masses @xmath2 , occur in the nuclei of most nearby galaxies with stellar bulges . the focus has now turned to searches for intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , with masses @xmath1 , in nearby galactic nuclei .",
    "finding imbhs will help to define the nature of the seed black holes that figure in models for the growth of black holes over cosmic time and to predict the gravitational radiation background expected for _ lisa _ due to mergers of imbhs . in this mass regime ,",
    "dynamical searches currently fail beyond the local group and are being replaced by surveys for signatures of active galactic nuclei ( agn ; * ? ? ?",
    "such agn searches are strongly guided by the discovery of a candidate imbh in @xcite , recently established as a bona fide nuclear imbh with mass ( 3.6@xmath31.1)@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "ngc4395 is a bulgeless sdm galaxy at a cepheid distance of 4.3@xmath30.3  mpc with a scale 0.021  pc  mas@xmath5 @xcite .",
    "its nucleus has the emission properties of a seyfert 1 , with broad permitted optical and uv emission lines @xcite and a pointlike , hard x - ray source that is highly time - variable @xcite .",
    "the reverberation study by @xcite reports a characteristic diameter for the uv broad - line - region ( blr ) of 7.0@xmath6  pc or 0.0033  mas .",
    "there are hints of an outflowing uv absorber close to the nucleus of this agn @xcite . also , in luminous agns , warm x - ray absorbers close to the nucleus are often associated with outflows ; in ngc4395 such absorbers",
    "have been inferred from variations in their ionization @xcite and/or column densities @xcite . while these x - ray and uv hints of outflows are intriguing , seeking structural evidence for an outflow is an essential next step .",
    "ngc4395 is one of only two nuclear imbhs that have been detected in the radio regime @xcite , important because vlbi on mas scales can then be used to search for structural evidence for an outflow on sub - parsec scales . at 1.4  ghz , the very long baseline array ( vlba ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) detected one source , with flux density 0.53@xmath30.13  mjy , spectral power @xmath7  w  hz@xmath5 , diameter less than 11  mas ( 0.2  pc ) , and brightness temperature more than 2 million k @xcite . while these traits are consistent with the vlba detection being accretion - powered by the imbh , the resolution and sensitivity of the vlba image failed to provide quantitative structural information .",
    "this letter reports improved imaging of the seyfert nucleus of ngc4395 at 1.4  ghz , using a vlbi high sensitivity array ( hsa ) consisting of the vlba , the very large array ( vla ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) operating in its phased mode , and the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ; * ? ? ?",
    "the hsa imaging is described in section 2 .",
    "the implications for the seyfert nucleus are explored in section 3 , with an emphasis on the discovery of elongated structure on sub - parsec scales .",
    "the hsa was used to observe ngc4395 and calibrators on 2005 may 1 0000 - 0800 ut .",
    "data were acquired in dual circular polarizations with 4-level sampling and at a center frequency of 1.43849  ghz with a bandwidth per polarization of 32  mhz , formed from four contiguous baseband channels each of width 8  mhz .",
    "antenna separations spanned 50 - 8600 km .",
    "phase - referenced observations were made in the nodding style .",
    "a 200 s observation of ngc4395 was preceded and followed by a 100 s observation of the phase , rate , and delay calibrator j1220 + 3431 about 1.5 from ngc4395 .",
    "observation and correlation assumed a coordinate equinox of 2000 .",
    "all _ a priori _ calibrator positions were taken from the goddard vlbi global solution 2004 f , and had one - dimensional errors at 1 @xmath8 better than 1 mas .",
    "the _ a priori _ position for ngc4395 was from @xcite after adjusting for the solution 2004 f position for j1220 + 3431 .",
    "data editing , calibration , and imaging were done using the 2005 december 31 release of the nrao aips software , following strategies outlined in the aips cookbook .",
    "correlation was affected by inappropriate earth orientation parameters , so corrections to those parameters were made @xcite .",
    "data deletion was based on system flags recorded at observation and media weights recorded at correlation .",
    "data compromised by radio frequency interference were also deleted , as were data on baselines involving any antenna observing below an elevation of 20 . for ngc4395",
    ", these steps yielded a total integration time of 4 hr . corrections for the dispersive delays caused by the earth s ionosphere were made using electron - content models from the jet propulsion laboratory .",
    "ancillary hsa data were used to set the amplitude scale to an accuracy of about 5% , after first correcting for sampler errors .",
    "the visibility data for j1220 + 3431 were used to generate phase - referenced visibility data for ngc4395 and for the check source j1215 + 3448 , observed to assess both the differential astrometry and the coherence losses .",
    "all calibrators were phase - self - calibrated .",
    "no self - calibrations were performed on ngc4395 .",
    "no polarization calibration was performed , as only an upper limit on the linear polarization percentage of ngc4395 was sought .",
    "aips task _ imagr _ was used to image all calibrators in stokes @xmath9 and ngc4395 in stokes @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "the visibility data for ngc4395 were imaged with natural weighting , achieving the expected theoretical rms noise within the field - of - view limits set by time and bandwidth averaging .",
    "the most constraining limit follows from accepting , at the field edge , a 5% drop in the peak amplitude due to averaging over each 8 mhz baseband channel ; the resulting field - of - view diameter is about 590  mas .",
    "a region of diameter 550  mas ( 12  pc ) was searched in stokes @xmath9 to match the upper limit of the unresolved vla detection @xcite .",
    "the seyfert nucleus was easily detected above 5 @xmath8 in the cleaned image and found to be slightly extended , with an integrated flux density of 0.74@xmath30.04  mjy being recovered ( fig .  1 , left ) .",
    "there were also hints of 5 @xmath8 emission about 250  mas ( 5.2  pc ) to the west of the nucleus .",
    "nothing else was detected in stokes @xmath9 above 5 @xmath8 or a brightness temperature threshold of 250,000  k. nothing was detected in stokes @xmath10 or @xmath11 so those images were not cleaned .",
    "near the seyfert nucleus , the image of linearly polarized intensity @xmath12 revealed no emission above 5 @xmath8 , implying an upper limit of 2% in the polarization percentage .",
    "the visibility data for ngc4395 were also imaged with a `` robustness '' parameter of -0.3 for an optimal balance between resolution and sensitivity @xcite .",
    "guided by the 4 @xmath8 contours in the cleaned stokes @xmath9 image ( fig .  1",
    ", right ) , emission extends from the peak for about 15  mas ( 0.3  pc ) along a position angle ( pa ) of about 28 .",
    "analysis of the check source j1215 + 3448 , observed 0.9 from j1220 + 3431 and imaged with the same robustness , implied a correction of about 2% for residual errors in the phase calibration and a one - dimensional error of about 3 mas in the differential astrometry .",
    "ngc4395 was observed 1.5 from j1220 + 3431 , so for that still - desirable geometry these corrections are conservatively doubled to about 4% and 6 mas , respectively",
    ". a quadratic fit to the peak in the right panel of figure  1 gave a corrected value of 0.24  mjy  beam@xmath5 and a position of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , with a one - dimensional error of 6  mas ( the quadratic sum of the errors due to the signal - to - noise ratio , in the position for j1220 + 3431 , and in the differential astrometry ) .    a standard analysis of the data from the internal vla baselines yielded an integrated flux density of 1.69@xmath30.08  mjy with a deconvolved diameter of less than 2 ( 42  pc ) , plus no evidence for adjacent emission on larger scales .",
    "for comparison , @xcite reported an integrated flux density of 1.68@xmath30.09  mjy with a deconvolved diameter of less than 550  mas ( 12  pc ) on 1999 aug 29 ut , and a spectral index @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) between 1.4 and 4.9  ghz .",
    "the hsa imaging thus recovers about 0.4 of the flux density available at 1.4  ghz .",
    "the imbh that energizes the seyfert nucleus in ngc4395 has an eddington ratio of only @xmath17 @xcite . by analogy with supermassive black holes and stellar - mass black holes",
    ", such an eddington ratio suggests that this imbh is in a low / hard or quiescent state and , thus , is expected to launch a steady polar outflow @xcite .",
    "the elongated structure in figure  1 is indeed suggestive of a radio outflow on sub - parsec scales from the imbh in ngc4395 .",
    "this radio structure extends for about 15  mas ( 0.3  pc ) along a pa of about 28 . from the observed smoothness of the h@xmath18 line , @xcite",
    "suggest that the blr gas is structured as a smooth , rotationally - dominated flow , most likely in a geometrically thick configuration .",
    "this geometrically thick structure may be involved in launching the suspected radio outflow .    for perspective , 20 of the 44 low - luminosity agn ( llagn ) surveyed at mas resolution by @xcite do show structure on sub - parsec scales .",
    "six of those 20 have sub - parsec scale structures with weak or no known larger scale jets , perhaps because the jet does not propagate beyond the inner few parsecs . for ngc4395 at 1.4  ghz , the vla source lacks adjacent emission and has the same integrated flux densities for deconvolved sizes of 10 - 40  pc , whereas the hsa imaging traces a suspected outflow on sub - parsec scales . given these vla and hsa properties , ngc4395 can now be added to the subset of llagn whose emission does not extend beyond the inner few parsecs . the spectral power of the emission recovered in the left panel of figure  1 is @xmath19  w  hz@xmath5 , while that for the corrected peak in the right panel of figure  1 is @xmath20  w  hz@xmath5 .",
    "as expected , these powers bracket the value derived from the vlba discovery image @xcite .",
    "the sub - parsec scale of the suspected outflow in ngc4395 corresponds to 10@xmath21 schwarszchild radii , very different from the upper limits of 10@xmath22 to 10@xmath23 schwarszchild radii inferred for several llagn with flat radio spectra @xcite .",
    "the potential importance of outflows in mediating black - hole growth has been highlighted by @xcite , motivating an estimate of the kinetic luminosity of the suspected outflow from ngc4395 .",
    "but unless the environs of the llagn are spatially resolved , such estimates can be very model - dependent .",
    "the environs of the llagn in m51 , at a distance of 8.4  mpc , are spatially resolved in the radio , optical , and x - ray regimes @xcite .",
    "moreover , vla imaging at 1.4  ghz shows that the llagn in m51 is only eight times as powerful as the llagn in ngc4395 , and similarly compact @xcite . for m51 ,",
    "@xcite estimate that the kinetic luminosity of its jet is comparable to the bolometric luminosity of its llagn .",
    "for ngc4395 , the bolometric luminosity of its llagn is @xmath24  ergs  s@xmath5 @xcite , so by analogy with m51 , a kinetic luminosity of this order could be available within the inner few parsecs of ngc4395 . approximating the radio luminosity of ngc4395 as the product of the frequency times power ,",
    "the luminosity of the emission recovered in the left panel of figure  1 is @xmath25  ergs  s@xmath5 , while that for the corrected peak in the right panel of figure  1 is @xmath26  ergs  s@xmath5 .",
    "although these radio luminosities are about six orders of magnitude below the bolometric luminosity of the seyfert nucleus , the hsa imaging helps set a characteristic length scale for the available kinetic luminosity .    the absorption - corrected , time - averaged 2 - 10 kev luminosity of the seyfert nucleus in ngc4395 is @xmath27  ergs  s@xmath5 @xcite . combining this with the 5-ghz luminosity of @xmath28  ergs  s@xmath5 @xcite , the nucleus of ngc4395 is formally radio - quiet , with @xmath29 @xcite . similarly , the nucleus is formally radio - quiet when cast in terms of its radio - to - optical ratio @xcite .",
    "still , this seyfert nucleus seems able to support a radio outflow , suggesting that the physically defining characteristic is the eddington ratio of its energizing imbh .",
    "hence while ngc4395 can be classed as a narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy energized by an imbh , its radio properties might be expected to differ from those for a sample of similar galaxies selected to have eddington ratios near unity @xcite .",
    "the pa of the sub - parsec scale radio structure , about 28 , can be compared to the other nuclear structures in ngc4395 imaged at lower resolution with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a wfpc2 i - band image ,",
    "the seyfert nucleus is located at the photometric center of a nuclear star cluster with a half - light diameter of 380  mas ( 8.0  pc ) , an axis ratio of 0.83 , and a minor - axis pa of 9 @xcite , confirming the earlier findings in the i band by @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the galactic disk has a minor - axis pa of 54 as traced by hi @xcite and 57 as traced by starlight @xcite .",
    "the elongation pa of the sub - parsec radio structure in ngc4395 is thus closer to the minor axis of the star cluster than that of the galactic disk .",
    "but the significance of this is unclear , given the propensity of jet directions in seyfert galaxies to be uncorrelated with the minor axes of their galactic disks @xcite .    in a wfpc f502n image centered on the [ oiii ] @xmath305007 line , the nuclear structure",
    "is somewhat resolved with emission - line gas extending to the west of the seyfert nucleus @xcite . using their wfpc2 b - band and i - band images , @xcite",
    "do find evidence for two structures to the west , namely a small blue arc offset by 250  mas ( 5.2  pc ) and an extended blue plume offset by about 1 ( 21  pc ) .",
    "@xcite argue that these two blue features are probably due to [ oiii ] emission from gas within a nuclear ionization cone .",
    "the opening angle of the cone structure covers pas of 265 - 280 , whereas the sub - parsec scale radio structure defines pas of about 28/208 .",
    "the relation between these two structures is not presently understood , perhaps due to projection effects for both structures .",
    "the naturally - weighted hsa image shows hints of 5 @xmath8 emission about 250  mas ( 5.2  pc ) to the west of the nucleus , thus in the vicinity of the small blue arc reported by @xcite .",
    "the reality of this faint extranuclear emission at 1.4  ghz is , at present , far from certain .",
    "but if it is real , it has peak brightness temperatures above 250,000  k in the vicinity of probable [ oiii ] emission @xcite .",
    "as the hsa imaging of the nucleus has recovered only about forty percent of the flux density available at 1.4  ghz , the faint extranuclear emission could be providing the first clues about the location of the approximately 1  mjy still missing from the hsa image .",
    "hsa imaging with higher sensitivity could test the reality of the faint extranuclear emission and should be done . also , _ hst _",
    "spectroscopic imaging of the small blue arc and the extended blue plume discovered by @xcite should be done to test the suggestion by those authors that these blue structures trace [ oiii ] emission .",
    "the nuclear star clusters in other late - type spiral galaxies are in most respects very similar to that in ngc4395 , and within each star cluster a mixture of stellar populations of different ages is found , suggesting a prolonged formation period @xcite . for ngc4395 , few constraints on the cluster s stellar populations are available .",
    "@xcite find no uv evidence for the p cygni profiles that would be expected from winds from massive ob stars .",
    "@xcite do detect the calcium infrared triplets , indicating that red supergiants are present .",
    "the half - light diameter of the nuclear star cluster is 380  mas ( 8.0  pc ) , so the hsa imaging samples most of the cluster s volume . to further constrain the stellar populations , as well as to assist with the radio - optical registration ,",
    "the naturally - weighted hsa image was searched for cluster emitters within the half - light diameter .",
    "none were found above a peak flux density of 0.05  mjy per beam , corresponding to a brightness temperature threshold of 250,000  k and a power threshold of @xmath31  w  hz@xmath5 .",
    "for comparison , an analog to the radio counterpart to an ultraluminous x - ray source , at a distance of 4.8  mpc in ngc5408 @xcite , would emit at the 0.3-mjy level at 4.8  ghz at the distance of ngc4395 .",
    "such emission would be consistent with the vla photometry of ngc4395 at 4.9  ghz @xcite .",
    "however , given its steep - spectrum nature , such a radio analog would be boosted well above the hsa detection threshold at 1.4  ghz and , thus , can not be present within the star cluster s half - light diameter .",
    "hsa imaging with higher sensitivity would help constraint other classes of cluster emitters .",
