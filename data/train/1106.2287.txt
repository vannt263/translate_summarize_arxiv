    "thus a modification of einstein equations * ? ? ?",
    "* becomes essential to incorporate this observational fact .",
    "one can either modify the geometry ( i.e. , the left hand side of einstein equation ) or the matter itself(i.e .",
    ", the r.h.s . ) if not both .",
    "due to modification of geometry , one can introduce modified gravitytheory namely @xmath0 gravity , brane scenario etc while change in the matter part indicates inclusion of some unknown kind of matters having large negative pressure so that strong energy condition ( @xmath1 ) is violated .",
    "such an unknown matter is known as dark energy(de ) .    in literature , there are various de models to match with observational data .",
    "the simplest model representing de is the cosmological constant which was introduced by einstein himself , surprisingly many years before the starting of de craze .",
    "however , this model of de is not very popular due to many inherent drawbacks ( for example fine tuning problem ( steinhardt 1997 ) ) .",
    "the other candidates for de are variable cosmological constant ( shapiro et .",

    "2006b ) .    in the present work we study the evolution of the horizons(apparent and event ) for different de models namely ( a ) de with barotropic equationof state , ( b ) holographic de(hde ) and ( c ) a non interacting two fluid system - hde and dark matter in the form of dust .",
    "the paper is assigned as follows : basic equations are presented in the section 2 , evolution of the horizons are studied for the above three matter systems in section 3 , section 4 deals with thermodynamical analysis of the universe bounded by the horizons .",
    "the paper ends withdiscussion and concluding remarks in section 5 .",
    "for simplicity let us start with homogeneous and isotropic model of the universe ( namely friedmann - robertson - walker(frw ) model ) , having line element    @xmath2\\ ] ]    @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xmath6 is the radius of the sphere(area - radius ) , a is the scale factor and @xmath7 stands for flat , closed and open model of our universe respectively .",
    "the matter is chosen as a perfect fluid with energy momentum tensor @xmath8 so the einstein field equations are ( choosing @xmath9 ) @xmath10 @xmath11 and the energy conservation equation is @xmath12    combining ( [ 3 ] ) and ( [ 4 ] ) we get , @xmath13    the dynamical apparent horizon which is essentially the marginally trapped surface with vanishing expansion , is defined as a sphere of radius @xmath14 such that @xmath15 which on simplification gives @xmath16    the event horizon on the other hand is defined as ( davis 1998 ) @xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the usual conformal time defined as    @xmath21    note that if @xmath22 , event horizon does not exist . also the hubble horizon is given by @xmath23 the horizons are related by the following relations ( mazumder 2009 ) : @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 @xmath28",
    "the time variation of the horizon radii are given by @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31    one may note that the expression for @xmath32 given in references ( davis 1998 ) and ( mohseni sadjadi 2006 ) are true only for @xmath33 .",
    "so the theorems given in the papers of davis(1998 ) and sadjadi(2006 ) are only valid flat universe .",
    "however , in the present work from the above expression ( i.e. , equation ( 13 ) ) we see that @xmath34 is an increasing or decreasing function of time that depends only on whether @xmath35- it does not depend on the nature of the matter involved as claimed by davis and sadjadi . + we shall now study the variation of the horizons with the evaluation of the universe . due to observed accelerating phase of the universe",
    ", the matter is assumed to be in the form of the de having equation of state @xmath36 .",
    "+ * case i : @xmath37 is constant + * for simplicity , if we assume the flat model of the universe then from equation ( [ 6 ] ) we have @xmath38 with @xmath39 . hence",
    "in the quintessence era we have @xmath40 .",
    "now solving the einstein field equation ( [ 3 ] ) and the conservation equation ( [ 5 ] ) we have @xmath41 then the horizons are given by @xmath42 hence , over one hubble time @xmath43 both have the same time variation , i.e. , @xmath44 thus there are no significant changes of the two horizons over the hubble time .",
    "+ * case ii : @xmath37 is variable + * here the choice of de is holographic model .",
    "the holographic principle states that the no . of degrees of freedom for",
    "a system within a finite region should be finite and is bounded roughly by the area of its boundary . from the effective quantum field theory one obtains the holographic energy density as ( cohen et al .",
    "1999 ) @xmath45 where free dimensionless parameter c is estimated from observation and ir cut off is chosen as @xmath34 to get correct expression .    then using expression (",
    "[ 18 ] ) in the conservation equation ( [ 5 ] ) the expression for the equation of state parameter is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the density parameters corresponding to de and curvature respectively .",
    "now from equations ( [ 12 ] ) and ( [ 13 ] ) the time variation of the horizons over one hubble time are given by @xmath49 and @xmath50 so both the horizons have the same time variation over one hubble time .",
    "+ * case iii : variable @xmath37 and two fluid syatem + * here we consider a non - interacting two fluid system having one component in the form of hde and the other component as dark matter ( in the form of dust ) .",
    "so the einstein equations for flat frw model now become    @xmath51    @xmath52    as the fluids are non - interacting so the energy conservation equations are @xmath53 and @xmath54 so from the expression of the energy density for the hde(given by equation ( [ 18 ] ) ) we have as before @xmath55 where variation of the density parameter is given by @xmath56 now the change of the horizons over one hubble time are given by the expressions @xmath57 @xmath58 thus compared to between the the above two cases the changes of the horizons over one hubble time are not identical , though they do not change significantly . +",
    "here we consider the universe bounded by the event or apparent horizon as a thermodynamical system . in the previous section",
    "we have shown that neither the apparent horizon nor the event horizon change significantly over one hubble time scale so equilibrium thermodynamics can be applied here with temperature and entropy on the horizon similar to black holes .",
    "+ * case i : matter in the form of perfect fluid :* + here matter bounded by the horizon is considered to be in the perfect fluid .",
    "the total entropy change can be written as ( for details see mazumder et al 2009 ) @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the radius of the horizon(event or apparent ) , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are respectively the entropy of the matter bounded by the horizon and that of the horizon , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the energy density and the thermodynamic pressure of the inside matter and @xmath65 is the temperature of the horizon as well as of the inside matter for equilibrium thermodynamics .",
    "thus generalised second law of thermodynamics will be valid in quintessence era @xmath66 if the radius of the horizon increases with time while in phantom era @xmath67 the radius of the horizon should decrease . + * case ii : matter in the form of hde :*",
    "+ if we differentiate the expression for the energy density of the hde ( i.e. , equation ( [ 18 ] ) ) then using the energy conservation equation ( [ 5 ] ) we obtain ( after simplification ) @xmath68 as before variation of the total entropy is given by equation ( [ 30 ] ) which using ( [ 31 ] ) becomes @xmath69 for event horizon . for the apparent horizon using equation (",
    "[ 12 ] ) and the friedmann equation ( [ 4 ] ) , equation ( [ 30 ] ) simplifies to @xmath70 thus generalised second law of thermodynamics hold for both the horizons when matter is purely in the form of hde . + * case iii : non - interacting two fluid system :*   + here matter in the universe bounded by the horizon ( event or apparent ) is in the form of non - interacting two fluid system - one component is hde @xmath71 and the other is dark matter in the form of dust @xmath72 .",
    "then total entropy variation ( for details see mazumder et .",
    "al . 2010 ) is given by @xmath73 thus energy density of dark matter plays a key role for the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics particularly in phantom era .",
    "we shall now discuss the behavior of the horizons with the evolution of the universe both in quintessence and phantom eras . from the conservation equation ( 5 )",
    "we see that in quintessence era @xmath63 is monotonic decreasing which reaches a local minima at the phantom crossing and increases again with the evolution of the universe as shown in fig i. so the matter density has some short of bouncing behavior at the phantom crossing .",
    "however , if the universe starts contracting in phantom era ( i.e. , @xmath74 ) then conservation equation demands @xmath63 should still decreases in the phantom era and there is a point of inflexion at the phantom barrier as shown in fig.ii .",
    "for both the possibilities in phantom era @xmath63 has peculiar behavior when matter is exotic in nature ( i.e. , @xmath75 ) . in the first case when universe is expanding @xmath63 also increases in the phantom era indicating some matter creation phenomena ( of unknown nature ) during that epoch .",
    "on the other hand , when universe starts contraction in the phantom era , @xmath63 still decreases , indicating destruction of mass in that era .",
    "fig.iii represents variation of event horizon and the apparent horizon respectively in an expanding universe model .",
    "the dotted vertical line again denotes the phantom divide line .",
    "as the previous diagrams left side of which is denoting the quintessence era whereas the right hand side represents the phantom era .",
    "like fig.iii , fig.iv also represents two curves showing the variation of event horizon and apparent horizon .",
    "the dotted vertical line denotes the phantom divide line .",
    "the left side of which is denoting the quintessence era whereas the right hand side represents the phantom era .",
    "we shall now present a comparative study of the evolution of the horizons across the phantom barrier with the expansion of the universe for the various de matter distribution in the following tabular form + * table i : comparative study of the two horizons across phantom barrier * +   +        +   +   + thus , from the above study we see that both the evolution of the horizons as well as the matter density have some strange behavior in the phantom era , i.e. , across the phantom barrier line .",
    "therefore , for future work cosmological evolution in phantom region will be done more in details and also it will be interesting to explain the particle creation in the phantom era with the expansion of the universe and possibly the mechanism of particle creation may remove the possible future singularity .",
