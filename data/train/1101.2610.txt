    "gravitational evidences for dark matter exist from galactic to cosmological scales , but its particle nature still remains unknown  @xcite .",
    "the most popular dark matter candidate , a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) , could in principle be detected directly through its scattering on atomic nuclei , indirectly by observing traces of its annihilation products in the cosmic - ray fluxes , or by its direct production at colliders . since the stability of dark matter is by no means established , there is also the possibility to observe cosmic - ray contributions stemming from the decay of dark matter particles .",
    "however , despite lots of efforts , no unambiguous non - gravitational dark matter signal has been found so far .",
    "indirect searches for dark matter annihilation or decay products in the cosmic gamma - ray , anti - particle and neutrino fluxes are limited not only by the instrument sensitivities , but also by our understanding of the astrophysical foregrounds .",
    "one of the few dark matter signatures that would unambiguously stand out of the astrophysical foreground are the monochromatic photons potentially produced in two - body annihilation or decay of dark matter .",
    "they would appear as a line feature in the otherwise continuous gamma - ray energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "the observation of such a gamma - ray line would thus be of paramount interest for the understanding of dark matter in the universe .",
    "the production of gamma - ray lines is expected in many theoretical dark matter models .",
    "the corresponding branching ratios are often very small , but this could be compensated by the high experimental sensitivity to such signals . in the popular scenario where dark matter is the lightest neutralino @xmath2 of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )  @xcite , gamma - ray lines from @xmath3 or @xmath4 annihilations are only produced at the one - loop level  @xcite , and they would be mostly out of reach for current experiments .",
    "however , their production can be enhanced in non - minimal variations of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , a large number of viable wimp models exist , some of them predicting a sizable annihilation into monochromatic photons , _",
    "e.g. _  singlet dark matter  @xcite , hidden u(1 ) dark matter  @xcite , effective dark matter scenarios  @xcite , scenarios with strong annihilation into the higgs boson and a photon  @xcite , inert higgs doublet dark matter  @xcite , or kaluza - klein dark matter in models with universal extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "additionally , prominent spectral features in the gamma - ray flux can be generated by the internal bremsstrahlung or final state radiation potentially produced in dark matter annihilation  @xcite .",
    "an interesting example of decaying dark matter is the gravitino @xmath5 , which appears in locally supersymmetric extensions of the standard model . in scenarios where",
    "@xmath0-parity and the lepton number are slightly violated and the gravitino is the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) , thermal leptogenesis , gravitino dark matter and primordial nucleosynthesis are naturally consistent  @xcite . within this framework , the gravitino is no longer stable and decays on cosmological time scales  @xcite , thus rendering the imprints of its decay potentially observable in the cosmic - ray fluxes  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the line feature generated by the two - body decay into neutrinos and photons , @xmath6 , is prominent for a wide range of gravitino masses  @xcite , suggesting that the first observation of gravitino dark matter could happen via gamma - ray lines .    in general , dark matter lifetimes of the order of @xmath7@xmath8s , which is in the ballpark of what is accessible by cosmic - ray experiments in the gev ",
    "tev regime , are obtained when the symmetry responsible for the dark matter stability is violated by dimension six operators generated close to the grand unification scale  @xcite .",
    "a typical example , which has a large branching fraction into monochromatic photons , is the hidden su(2 ) vector dark matter  @xcite .",
    "note that even if dark matter only decays into charged leptons at tree level , like in the models designed to explain the pamela / fermi  lat  @xmath9 measurements  @xcite , gamma - ray lines produced at the one - loop level could potentially be observable  @xcite .    a dedicated search for galactic gamma - ray lines with energies between 30 and 200 gev using the fermi large area telescope ( lat )",

    "@xcite to put constraints on gamma - ray lines from cosmological dark matter annihilation  @xcite . in that case , the redshifted gamma - ray lines lead to less pronounced features in the energy spectrum than the galactic ones .",
    "the lack of spectral features in the egbg was used to put limits on the corresponding annihilation cross section .",
    "further gamma - line searches , coming from different observations , and ranging from energies of @xmath10 up to @xmath11 , were presented for annihilation in ref .",
    "@xcite and for decay in ref .",
    "general strategies for the detection of gamma - ray lines from dark matter annihilation with fermi lat and future experiments were discussed in refs .",

    "@xcite to a larger energy range of @xmath12@xmath13 , searching for significant line signals that might come from dark matter annihilating or decaying in the galactic dark matter halo , and derive conservative constraints .",
    "although highly relevant for the gravitino dark matter scenario , no dedicated search for gamma - ray lines from decaying dark matter in the whole @xmath14gev  tev@xmath15 energy regime has been performed so far .",
    "furthermore , the large statistics of the fermi lat data allows us to further probe the low energy regime , _",
    "i.e. _  energies from 1 to 10 gev , and thus strengthening the previous egret bounds on annihilating dark matter  @xcite .",
    "such energies are of particular interest in the view of the recent hints from direct dark matter detection reported by the cdms  @xcite , cogent  @xcite and dama  @xcite collaborations .",
    "second , we will discuss the impact of our results on decaying gravitino dark matter .",
    "covering previously unexplored values of the gravitino mass , we will use our limits on gamma - ray lines to constrain the size of @xmath0-parity violation , which can be translated into lower limits on the decay lengths of neutralino or stau nlsps .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we present our analysis of the fermi lat data .",
    "after briefly discussing the gamma - ray flux produced in the dark matter annihilation or decay , we present the strategy for data extraction and line searches in section 2.1 .",
    "section 2.2 is devoted to a presentation of the resulting bounds on annihilation cross section and decay rate , whereas in section 2.3 we discuss details and caveats of our analysis . in section 3",
    ", we apply our results to gravitino dark matter and discuss prospects for nlsp observations at particle colliders .",
    "we then conclude in section  4 .",
    "our line search is based on the measurements of the cosmic gamma - ray flux performed since august 2008 by the large area telescope ( lat ) , the main instrument on the fermi gamma - ray space telescope .",
    "the lat is a pair conversion detector , designed to observe gamma rays with energies ranging from 30 mev to more than 300 gev with an energy resolution of about @xmath16 .",
    "it has a large field - of - view that spans around @xmath17 of the sky , allowing an effective measurement of the all - sky diffuse fluxes . from the four event classes presented in the available public data , we only consider the recently released ` dataclean ' event class , which provides the best rejection of charged cosmic rays",
    "this is especially important when analyzing the diffuse gamma - ray flux at high energies .",
    "gamma - ray lines may find their origin in the decay or annihilation of dark matter particles @xmath18 in the galactic halo .",
    "the observed gamma - ray flux at earth is given by a line - of - sight integral depending linearly on the dark matter distribution @xmath19 when considering dark matter decays @xmath20 while in the annihilation case , it depends quadratically on @xmath19 @xmath21 here , @xmath22 is the dark matter mass , while @xmath23 and @xmath24 denote the dark matter decay width and annihilation cross section into gamma - ray lines , respectively .",
    "the coordinate @xmath25 runs along the line of sight , in a direction spanning an angle @xmath26 with respect to the galactic center direction .",
    "the distance to the galactic center @xmath27 is related to the distance to the sun @xmath25 through @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the distance of the sun to the galactic center  @xcite .",
    "we consider the navarro - frenk - white ( nfw ) profile  @xcite @xmath30^{-\\gamma } \\left [    \\frac{1+(r_0/r_s)^\\alpha}{1+(r / r_s)^\\alpha }    \\right]^{\\frac{\\beta-\\gamma}{\\alpha}}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is defined by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , as a reference for the dark matter distribution .",

    "the gamma - ray line energies are chosen such that the corresponding limits dominate in their respective energy bands in case of the halo region .",
    "furthermore , the energy ranges shown in the plots correspond to the energy windows used in the fitting procedure , and we rebinned the data for better visibility . at low energies",
    "the gamma - ray line constraints essentially come from the non - observation of a strong bending in the measured energy spectrum ( with signal - to - background ratios as small as @xmath45 ) , whereas at high energies , where the considered energy window is larger , the constraints come from the non - observation of a well defined bump .    in summary , due to the apparent presence of line - like artefacts at the few percent level in the energy spectrum of the public ` dataclean ' event class of the fermi lat , the flux limits from fig .",
    "[ fig : bounds_flux ] are expected to be too strong in some cases , especially at energies below @xmath46 . instead , the limits presented in fig .  [ fig : bounds_ddm ] , [ fig : bounds_adm ] and tab .",
    "[ tab : bounds ] should be used .",
    "further more general uncertainties and systematic effects enter our analysis  @xcite : the systematic uncertainties in the effective area are energy dependent and increase from @xmath47 at 560 mev to @xmath17 at 10100 gev in case of the ` dataclean ' event class  @xcite ( note that these uncertainties amount mainly to an overall shift in the effective area ) .",
    "uncertainties on the level of around @xmath17 are expected to continue up to energies of hundreds of gev  @xcite , but one has to keep in mind that a precise determination of the effective area at these high energies is still lacking due to limited statistics .",
    "however , even values reasonably larger than @xmath17 would only mildly affect our conclusions . over the whole considered energy range , the systematics of the lat effective area consequently translate into uncertainties for our dark matter limits that range between @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the absolute energy scale of the fermi lat is determined up to @xmath49  @xcite .",
    "this translates into an additional uncertainty on the dark matter annihilation cross section @xmath50 of @xmath51 , and on the decay width @xmath23 of @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "finally , we have also checked that when extending our analysis to @xmath52 no significant line signals at high energies are revealed , and the limits below the highest energy band presented in tab .",
    "[ tab : bounds ] are only marginally affected .",
    "considering the @xmath53@xmath13 ( @xmath54@xmath52 ) energy band , we obtain in this case @xmath55 for the halo region , and @xmath56 for the center region .",
    "however , we emphasize that energies above 300gev lie outside of the nominal energy range of the fermi lat .",
    "local extensions of the supersymmetric standard model predict the existence of the gravitino , the supersymmetric partner of the graviton . depending on the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking",
    ", it can be the lightest superparticle ( lsp ) . in this case",
    ", it provides a natural dark matter candidate  @xcite , and is an interesting alternative to the standard wimp scenario .",
    "the dominant contribution to the gravitino production in the early universe comes from the 2-to-2 qcd scatterings , which are taking place in the thermal bath at reheating .",
    "the resulting energy density is given by @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the reheating temperature , while @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the gravitino and gluino masses , respectively .",

    "] remarkably , the observed dark matter relic density @xmath63  @xcite is obtained for typical supersymmetric parameters , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and for reheating temperatures @xmath66 as required for thermal leptogenesis to generate the observed baryon asymmetry  @xcite .",
    "however , the above scenario is not free of problems : if @xmath0-parity is conserved , the decay of the next - to - lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) into gravitino and standard model particles is suppressed by the planck scale . as a consequence ,",
    "the nlsp becomes very long - lived and can dramatically affect the successful prediction of the standard big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) scenario  @xcite .",
    "several alternative scenarios have been proposed to consistently accommodate thermal leptogenesis , gravitino dark matter and bbn , like assuming sneutrino  @xcite or stop  @xcite nlsps , diluting the nlsp abundance by entropy production  @xcite , or introducing new nlsp decay channels into hidden sector states  @xcite .",
    "also , the reheating temperature can be considerably reduced by considering non - thermal leptogenesis scenarios , as for example recently proposed in mechanisms where the universe is reheated through the decay of non - relativistic right - handed neutrinos produced in false vacuum decay  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been proposed that @xmath0-parity could be mildly violated  @xcite .",
    "such a violation could be _",
    "e.g. _  produced by dynamical breaking of u(1)@xmath67 at low scales in the hidden sector  @xcite .",
    "it would lead to a rapid decay of the nlsp before the onset of bbn , thus rendering its impact on the standard cosmological picture negligible .",
    "notably , even though the gravitino is not stable anymore in such a case , it still constitutes a viable dark matter candidate because its decay into standard model particles is doubly suppressed by the small @xmath0-parity breaking parameter as well as by the planck mass  @xcite , leading to lifetimes longer than the age of the universe .",
    "this @xmath0-parity violating scenario is particularly attractive because it opens up the possibility to probe gravitino dark matter by searching for its decay products in the cosmic - ray fluxes .",
    "in addition to cosmic anti - matter  @xcite and neutrino  @xcite fluxes , the produced gamma - ray flux  @xcite is of high interest because , besides the continuous component generated by the fragmentation of the higgs and gauge bosons , the gamma - ray energy spectrum typically features an intense line , arising from the @xmath68 two - body decay already at tree level .    in the rest of this section",
    ", we will apply the above fermi lat limits on gamma - ray lines to the decaying gravitino scenario .",
    "first , we will summarize the relevant aspects of bilinear @xmath0-parity violation , which will form the theoretical framework of our analysis .",

    "this can be achieved by a supersymmetric rotation of the superfields , followed by a non - supersymmetric rotation of the scalar fields alone .",
    "besides the @xmath0-parity breaking yukawa couplings , which will become relevant for the decay of the stau nlsp below , these rotations also generate mass - mixing terms between the neutralinos and the neutrinos .",

    "] however , allowing negative @xmath86 or scalar masses much larger than @xmath87 at the gut scale would weaken this limit , and we will take @xmath92 as a lower bound for the neutralino mass subsequently . in the stau nlsp case ,",

    "together with a lower bound on the gluino mass @xmath96gev  @xcite , this implies a lower bound for the gravitino mass @xmath97gev .",

    "such lines could be produced in dark matter annihilation or decay , and they are highly relevant for dark matter searches since they provide an essentially background free signature . to calculate the significance of potential gamma - ray lines in the diffuse flux , we used a binned profile likelihood method and fitted the observed energy spectrum locally with a line signal as expected from decaying or annihilating dark matter inside the galactic halo plus a power law that resembles the astrophysical background fluxes .",
    "no gamma - ray line was found at @xmath1  confidence level , and we derived conservative upper limits on the gamma - ray line flux that comes from regions with high galactic latitudes or from the galactic center ( tab .  [",

    "we also discussed the apparent presence of several line - like features at the few percent level in the public data , which appear at energies below 20 gev with @xmath139 significance and which are most probably due to instrumental effects .    our conservative upper limits on the partial annihilation cross section of wimp dark matter into @xmath140-pairs , @xmath141 ,",

    "the previous fermi lat limits are however only slightly improved .",
    "the reason is a somewhat worse energy resolution of the public data with respect to the dedicated fermi lat analysis as well as our strategy to always quote conservative limits in certain energy bands .",
    "the lower bounds on the inverse decay widths of dark matter into monochromatic photons , @xmath147 , are at the level of @xmath148 over most of the considered energy regime ( fig .",
