    "there has been much interest recently devoted to the description of granular media .",
    "the understanding of their physical properties is important because they appear in many different phenomena taking place in our daily life as well as in various industrial processes .",
    "experiments have been devised which have permitted to focus on many different and new aspects . when subjected to injection of energy ( vibrated plates for example ) , they present many similarities with fluids : convection take place , patterns can form and time - periodicity may be observed @xcite .    for those fluidized granular media , careful investigations have permitted to test the adequacy of hydrodynamical continuum equations generalized to take into account the dissipation of energy due to the inelasticity of the collisions between the grains .",
    "those equations are usually closed with the help of an equation of state and of phenomenological laws inspired by the hard - sphere model for fluids @xcite .",
    "also , kinetic theory models have been studied obtaining good accord with computer simulations in the low density cases @xcite .    in most of these works ,",
    "granular media are described microscopically by means of the inelastic hard sphere ( ihs ) model .",
    "grains are modeled as soft hard spheres that dissipate energy at collision through a constant restitution coefficient @xmath0 .",
    "it is quite remarkable that such a simple model can already account for many peculiarities of the observed behavior @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we would like to go one step further : namely to investigate the ihs model as if it was a genuine statistical mechanical model for a granular fluid , and examine the effects of the inelasticity on the statistical properties of the fluid .",
    "one first obvious difference is the absence of any equilibrium state .",
    "let to itself , an assembly of inelastic hard spheres will evolve towards a final state with no motion .",
    "one can however achieve stationary states by allowing contact with an energy reservoir , but those states are nonequilibrium states with a permanent energy flow coming from the reservoir and dissipated at collisions into the internal elasticity of the grains ( and neglected for our purpose ) .",
    "it is our aim to describe these non equilibrium steady state ( ness ) , considering the dissipativity @xmath1 , defined as @xmath2 , as the parameter responsible for deviations from the equilibrium hard sphere system .",
    "letting a system composed of ihs grains is let to evolve freely with periodic boundary conditions , it cools down homogeneously .",
    "this homogeneous cooling state ( hcs ) has been widely studied @xcite , and because of its simplicity the hcs has been used as a reference state to build up theories for non - homogeneous states .",
    "it is the analog of the equilibrium state ( with a maxwellian distribution ) for elastic systems @xcite . among other features",
    ", it has been shown that , in this state , the velocity distribution function is not maxwellian , having a nonvanishing fourth cumulant and a long velocity tail @xcite .",
    "also , long range velocity correlations are developed , in the form of vortex fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it has been realized that , for any given value of the inelasticity , whatever small , there is always a size over which the homogeneous reference state looses its stability .",
    "the system undergoes a transition towards a state with a shear flow spontaneously developing and possibly towards an inhomogeneous clustered state @xcite . in order to characterize intrinsic properties like an equation of state",
    ", one needs to restrict to consider stable homogeneous states before any instability occurs .",
    "this means in general to consider slight inelasticities and finite system sizes where @xmath3 effects are present , @xmath4 being the number of grains .",
    "computer simulation techniques has proven very valuable in granular studies : like in molecular dynamics ( md ) , computers are used to integrate numerically the equations of motion of a few hundred to a few thousand grains whose interaction is usually limited to inelastic collisions .",
    "the computed behavior compares generally well with experiments , which give confidence in the adequacy of the inelastic hard sphere model for accounting for most of the specificities of granular fluids .",
    "we are going to use such a technique with a mechanism added in order to keep the kinetic energy of the grains constant .",
    "the essential result obtained is the characterization of short range correlations which are built in granular fluid models and which determine both the static ( equation of state ) and dynamical properties ( kinetic equation ) of the granular fluid .",
    "the pressure of the stationary state is computed from its mechanical definition and we can show that it is related to the pair correlation function at contact for precollisional configurations only .",
    "this induces an extra variable in the pair correlation function , the angle between relative distance and relative velocity at collision .",
    "second , the kinetic description of the stationary state is well described by the ( modified ) hierarchy equations . in order to write a closed equation for the one - particle distribution function , like the enskog equation for hard spheres ,",
    "some assumptions are made on the two particle distribution function . in enskog s equation , it is assumed that the particles that collide do not have velocity correlations ( or dynamical correlations ) .",
    "when two particles are at contact with approaching velocities ( precollisional state ) , it is assumed that the two particle distribution function @xmath5 can be well approximated by  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pair correlation function at contact and the heaviside function guarantees that it is a precollisional state . note that in elastic systems at equilibrium ,",
    "the previous relation is exact .",
    "we show here that this assumption is no more true for inelastic hard spheres , with an increased probability that colliding disks or spheres are parallel rather than antiparallel , at least for moderately dense fluids .",
    "such velocity correlations might also appear in elastic fluids but only under nonequilibrium regimes ( typically over macroscopic scales ) . here",
    "they appear on the shortest scales , those which correspond to molecular distances , only because of the dissipative character of the microscopic dynamics .",
    "the article is organized as follows : first , we present with some detail the simulation technique which has been used .",
    "as already mentioned , we simulate grain dynamics at constant energy : at every collision , all particle velocities are rescaled so as to keep the total kinetic energy constant .",
    "we present the technique and emphasize in particular its equivalence with a time - rescaling change .",
    "next , we analyze the pressure and the pair - correlation function in the stationary state by making time averages of observables and configurations . the analysis lead in particular to the need of considering velocity correlations which , as will be shown , are also responsible for a pressure drop .",
    "this is done in the fourth section , before the conclusions .",
    "in the hcs the system is in a non - stationary state that does not allow to make time averages of different properties . it is then necessary to inject energy to the system in order to keep is stationary .",
    "different methods have been used , mainly the injection of energy trough the walls ( vibrating or stochastic ) , by external fields ( like the flow in a pipe ) or by stochastic forces acting on the particles ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "these methods have the disadvantage of destroying the homogeneity of the fluid or , in the case of the stochastic forces , adding other dynamical effects @xcite .    in this article",
    "we use a thermalizing method that both preserves the homogeneity and the dynamical properties of the granular fluid .",
    "formally , each time two particles collide , the dissipated energy in reinjected immediately into the system by multiplying all particle velocities by the same factor .",
    "this factor is chosen each time in order to keep kinetic energy constant . as the ihs model does not have an intrinsic energy ( or time )",
    "scale the rescaling of all velocities does not change the evolution of the system , the collision sequence ( thus all physical phenomena ) is preserved but viewed at a different speed . in this sense this thermostating mechanism is the most appropriate for the hcs .    in this nonequilibrium steady state ( ness )",
    "all macroscopic quantities are stationary and can be averaged in numerical simulations . if we set the initial energy to give a temperature equal to one , then all averaged quantities correspond to computing them at this temperature . to obtain the value at another temperature",
    ", simple dimensional analysis gives the desired value .",
    "for example , if @xmath8 is the computed pressure in the ness , the actual value of the pressure at another temperature @xmath9 is @xmath10 .",
    "the ihs model is simulated using event driven molecular dynamics @xcite .",
    "a direct implementation of the thermalizing method would lead to a computational cost proportional to the total number of particles for each collision , making impossible to make long simulations .",
    "but we can take advantage of the lack of an energy scale to make it much faster . in effect , rescaling all velocities is equivalent to rescaling the time .",
    "we define a rescaled time by the relation @xmath11 with @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the total energy in the system .",
    "note that @xmath14 is a piecewise constant decreasing function .",
    "it can directly checked that if rescaled velocities are defined as @xmath15 , then the rescaled kinetic energy ( @xmath16 ) is conserved .",
    "this transformation have been successfully used to study the shearing instability  @xcite .",
    "then , the simulation is done for the cooling ihs model ( that is , no velocity rescaling is done ) but at each collision the new kinetic energy is computed and @xmath14 is evaluated using eq .",
    "[ gamma ] . in the simulation ,",
    "then , the energy and the average velocity decrease , but the rescaled velocities are computed using @xmath17 . having the rescaled velocities ,",
    "all the static properties can be computed directly .",
    "since the function @xmath14 is piecewise constant , the @xmath18-time can be integrated in the simulation ; this allows to make periodical measurements in the ness ( equally spaced in @xmath18 ) .    finally , to avoid roundoff errors , each time",
    "the kinetic energy has decreased by some orders of magnitude ( typically @xmath19 of the initial value ) a real velocity rescaling is done to put again the temperature equal to one . in this process also",
    "the center of mass velocity is subtracted because , otherwise , small errors will be amplified by the rescaling .",
    "as already mentioned the hcs becomes unstable ( shearing instability ) for certain values of dissipativity , density , and system size .",
    "given values for the dissipativity and density , the system size ( number of particles ) is constrained to be smaller than a certain value to keep the system homogeneous . in 2d for a low density and low dissipation case , it is given by @xcite @xmath20    for larger densities there are more complex expressions written in terms of the transport coefficients , but in all cases there is a maximum system size over which the system becomes unstable .",
    "this phenomenon does not allow to simulate large systems ( for example , for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) and finite size effects are obtained .",
    "to avoid these effects , simulations with different number of particles are done and then the results are extrapolated to the infinite size limit .",
    "the extrapolation is done using the standard model for any quantity that does not vanish in this limit , that is , for any quantity @xmath24 its size dependence is modeled as @xmath25    when @xmath26 is smaller than around 1000 , the effects of the shearing instability are present before the critical value as fluctuations in the @xmath27 mode of the shearing velocity @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations have both large amplitudes and long correlation times ( divergent at the critical point ) . some quantities couple strongly with this fluctuating field ( for example , the pressure ) and small system sizes must be studied to extrapolate to infinity .",
    "we present series of simulations in 2d for the ihs model in the non equilibrium steady state already described .",
    "dimensions are chosen such that the disk diameter , particle masses and initial temperature are set equal to one .",
    "the simulations are done at three different number densities ( @xmath28 ) : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath21 . in each case",
    "the dissipation coefficient takes the values @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath22 .",
    "given the small values of the dissipation coefficients , long simulations are needed to obtain good statistics in order to identify the @xmath1-dependence of the different quantities .    as the simulations are done for small dissipations ,",
    "the results are presented as series in the coefficient @xmath1 . also , when possible , the results are condensed in power expansions in the density , but these expressions must not be interpreted as assuming that these quantities are necessarily analytic in density or dissipativity .    finally , unit s are chosen such that the disk diameter @xmath35 and the particles masses are set to one .",
    "also , the temperature in the ness is fixed to one .",
    "as in granular media there is no equivalent to a free energy or an entropy , the pressure can not be defined thermodynamically but only mechanically .",
    "we use the virial expression for the pressure @xcite that is a mechanical definition valid for any isotropic system composed of particles that interact with pairwise forces .",
    "if the total volume is @xmath36 and the total kinetic energy is @xmath37 , in 2d the pressure is given by @xmath38    in the ness , kinetic energy is constant and equal to @xmath4 and the forces are impulsive ones . using the collision rule ,",
    "it is easy to check that the forces are given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the collision time for the pair @xmath41 , and the relative velocity is evaluated before the collision .",
    "then , if the average is written as a time average , the delta functions are integrated giving @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the averaging time , and it has been used that particles diameter is set to one .    in simulations we measure the quantity @xmath44 in terms of which the total pressure is given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the collision frequency .",
    "the results from the simulations , fitted linearly with @xmath1 are @xmath47    that collected can be fitted to @xmath48    the average in eq .",
    "[ pvirial1 ] can also be written also as an ensemble average    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the angle between the relative velocity and the relative position .",
    "assuming lack of velocity correlations at collisions , the two particle distribution function can be replaced by eq .",
    "[ nocorr ] . in this case",

    "does not give the most relevant result .",
    "the pair correlation function is defined in elastic systems as the probability of having two particles separated at a distance @xmath57 , with an adequate normalization .",
    "this definition does not take into account the relative motion of the two particles since it is known that in equilibrium , positions are not correlated with velocities .",
    "but , as it is shown bellow , in granular media positions and velocities are highly correlated even in the low density limit , having the pair correlation function different behavior if the two particles approach or separate .    in enskog s kinetic theory , the @xmath54 factor that appears in eq .",
    "[ nocorr ] , in the collisional term , in the virial pressure , and in the transport coefficients must be understood as the pair correlation function at contact for particles that are approaching and not for the ones that separate . in what follows",
