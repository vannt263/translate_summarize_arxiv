    "this technology can enable efficient participation of flexible loads in energy markets through leveraging carefully designed price and load information exchange schemes .",
    "given this context , efficient load scheduling and aggregation is a problem of growing importance in the area of demand response .",
    "however , the problem of scheduling large numbers of household loads , which comprise 25 - 30% of system load in advanced economies and higher elsewhere , is particularly challenging for two main reasons .",
    "first , household agents are self - interested and aim at minimizing their costs and maximizing their comfort levels , whereas the aggregator aims at decreasing peak demand and minimizing the cost of electricity purchased in a pooled wholesale market .",
    "therefore , the challenge lies in devising a coordination scheme to aggregate these households into a usable dr resource that aligns the objectives of the households with the objectives of the aggregator .",
    "second , many household electrical devices have discrete operating points that can only be represented by mixed - integer variables ( as in @xcite ) , and some household device uses are often coupled , thus giving household electricity demand a combinatorial structure @xcite .",
    "however , most energy management methods , such as those in @xcite , address only one facet of the dr problem , which is local energy and comfort management . that is , they do not address system - wide aggregation of these dr capable households ; moreover , the methods proposed in these works are either incompatible with wide - area aggregation or simply intractable in large - scale problems @xcite .",
    "the presence of mixed - integer variables results in a mixed - integer program ( mip ) that has a np - hard computational complexity .",
    "therefore , solving the dr aggregation problem centrally , as in @xcite , may spell intractability when the number of households is large . furthermore , solving this problem centrally requires sending all of the households private information to the aggregator , which entails substantial communication overhead and privacy concerns .",
    "to this end , distributed methods are emerging as a way of efficiently implementing large - scale dr .",
    "the existing literature on distributed methods for demand response is split into two main categories .",
    "the first category includes methods that treat the household energy levels as continuous @xcite , which often renders the underlying dr problem convex and therefore computationally conducive .",
    "the second category of papers includes the more realistic methods that treat the household energy levels as a mixture of discrete and continuous and account for inter - temporal device couplings @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the dr problem is decomposed in terms of devices and a waterfilling - inspired negotiation mechanism is proposed to reduce electricity generation costs , whereas @xcite proposes a method for the energy management of several prosumers in an energy district in the aim of maximizing the energy district s utility and reducing reverse energy flows . in @xcite , a suboptimal distributed algorithm based on an extended lyapunov optimization technique",
    "is used to control the switching states of hvac units in the aim of reducing the average variation of nonrenewable energy demand while ensuring user comfort .",
    "the works in @xcite and @xcite aim at flattening the load profile by minimizing the deviation of the total load in a time - slot from the mean total load over the scheduling horizon subject to the minimum cost of individual consumers .",
    "the resulting bi - level optimization problem is transformed into its equivalent single - level problem and solved in a distributed fashion .",
    "however , the focus in @xcite and @xcite is not on pricing strategies but on demand profile reshaping .",
    "moreoever , @xcite shows that the nonconvex demand response problem that results from incorporating devices with interruptible tasks has a zero duality gap if the problem is formulated over a continuous - time horizon .",
    "it also shows that , in a discrete - time horizon , the duality gap vanishes as the granularity of the discretization is increased .",
    "a conventional gradient method is used in @xcite to solve the nonconvex discrete - time dr problem . on the other hand ,",
    "an approximate greedy iterative algorithm is used in @xcite to find sub - optimal energy consumption schedules for the users .",
    "additionally , the algorithm in @xcite is guided towards convergence by introducing a penalty term that penalizes large changes between successive iterations .",
    "the dr model in @xcite , also decomposed in terms of devices , is solved in a distributed fashion using the proximal bundle method .",
    "similar to @xcite and @xcite , the dr problems in @xcite and @xcite are decomposed in terms of devices but use concepts from game theory to solve the problem . in more detail , a game theoretic approach based on a modified regret matching procedure is proposed in @xcite to solve the problem to within @xmath29 of the optimum , whereas @xcite formulates the problem as a noncooperative game and uses mechanism design to distributedly solve the problem to a near - optimal nash equilibrium .",
    "furthermore , the work in @xcite proposes a novel auction format , inspired by the clock - proxy auction in @xcite , for the on - line scheduling of large numbers of households and small- and medium - sized businesses , and shows how the mechanism improves the efficiency of on - line energy use scheduling .",
    "in contrast to @xcite and @xcite , the dr problem in this work and in our previous work @xcite is decomposed in terms of households . doing so , allows for a more expressive household model , which can incorporate the intricate couplings between storage devices , appliances and distributed energy resources . in contrast to @xcite , the method in this paper accounts for user satisfaction and comfort and engages an algorithm that terminates in substantially fewer iterations .    against this background ,",
    "this paper proposes a fast distributed gradient algorithm applied to the double smoothed dual function of the adopted dr problem and shows how to recover a near - optimal primal solution .",
    "in more detail , this paper advances the state of the art in the following ways :    * the nonconvex dr problem in this work is decomposed in terms of households , which facilitates incorporating the intricate couplings between storage devices , appliances and distributed energy resources . *",
    "the proposed distributed gradient algorithm is applied to a double smoothed dual function and is designed to terminate in @xmath2 iterations , which can be ideal for an on - line version of this problem .",
    "* numerical simulations show that , with minimal parameter tuning , the proposed algorithm exhibits a similar convergence behavior throughout all the studied systems and converges to near - optimal solutions , which corroborates its scalability .",
    "the paper also provides a deeper insight into the geometry of the dual function of the dr problem and shows that this dual function is nonsmooth .",
    "consequently , the paper demonstrates that a conventional gradient method fails to solve this problem even if the integrality constraints are relaxed and the problem is convex .",
    "taken together , these advances show that the proposed algorithm represents a feasible method for implementing large - scale demand response .",
    "the paper progresses with notation and pertinent concepts from convex optimization in section  [ sec : preliminaries ] , followed by a description of the dr model in section  [ sec : drmodel ] .",

    "in addition , sending the households private information to the aggregator requires a large communication overhead in a setting with a large number of household agents , even before privacy issues are considered .",

    "figure  [ dualplot ] also showcases the slow convergence of a conventional gradient method as delineated by the white line .",
    "therefore , in order to accelerate convergence , a double smoothing technique is introduced , which involves regularizing the dual problem in to allow applying a fast gradient method @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  [ sec : aggregationproblem ] , the dual function of the dr problem at hand is typically nonsmooth and not strongly convex .",

    "these oscillations stem from a combination of two reasons .",

    ". therefore , a change in the price signal @xmath198 can result in @xmath287 changing in discrete steps .",
    "the second reason is that the test systems are a replication of the data set of 10 distinct households .",
    "therefore all the similar households will exhibit the same best response to the price signal @xmath198 which entails that the effect of the first reason will be magnified on the collective level . by this reasoning ,",
    "this oscillatory behavior of the recovered primal iterates should not exist when all the variables are continuous and the problem is convex .",
    "indeed , figure  [ 40relaxed ] shows that the recovered primal iterates of a relaxed version of the test system with @xmath288 do not exhibit this oscillatory behavior .",
    "it is also evident from figure  [ 40relaxed ] that an optimal solution can be found within @xmath2 iterations for a relaxed version of the adopted dr problem .",
    "in fact , a close inspection of figure  [ 40relaxed ] and figure  [ 40users0storage ] shows that the modified dual function exhibits a very similar convergence behavior in both the original nonconvex problem and its convex relaxation .",
    "moreover , to see the superiority of the fast gradient algorithm ( applied to the double smoothed dual function ) over a conventional gradient method ( applied to the original nonsmooth dual function ) , figure  [ 40lr ] shows the evolution of the recovered primal and original dual objectives of the test system with @xmath288 using a conventional gradient method with a step size of @xmath289 . in this case , the dual function is nonsmooth and exhibits an oscillatory behavior for a geometric interpretation of the oscillations . ] just like the recovered primal .",
    "this has an adverse effect on the stopping criteria of the algorithm .",
    "additionally , it is clear from figure  [ 40lr ] that the duality gap ( and also the optimality gap ) does not decrease below @xmath290 .",
    "the same observation applies to all the considered test systems .",
    "finally , the computational effort of the proposed fast gradient method is distributed among the agents .",
    "the miqps solved by agents @xmath61 take less than @xmath291 seconds to solve in the worst case and the aggregator subproblem and primal recovery problems require less than @xmath292 seconds each to solve in the worst case . therefore ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ computationtimes ] , the parallel solve time of the algorithm is at most @xmath293 seconds ( neglecting communication overhead ) , which can be ideal for an on - line version of this problem . in a practical implementation , the convergence time of the algorithm is expected to align with the local energy market s operation .",
    "for example , in the australian national electricity market , supply procurement auctions are run for each @xmath294 minute period . in this case , @xmath294 minutes is ample time compared to the @xmath295 seconds required for the proposed algorithm to complete @xmath2 iterations and find a near - optimal solution .",
    "the aim of this work is to demonstrate the scalability of a fast gradient algorithm applied to the double smoothed dual function of a large - scale nonconvex dr problem comprising expressive household models and mixed - integer variables .",
    "this work demonstrates how to recover a near - optimal solution within a preset small number of iterations and minimal parameter tuning .",
    "more specifically , the solutions recovered from the algorithm are on average within @xmath296 of the optimum .",
    "additionally , the results show that the convergence of the algorithm exhibits a similar behavior across the studied test systems , which corroborates the method s scalability .",
    "the paper also provides a geometrical insight into the dual problem of the adopted nonconvex dr model and highlights the inefficacy of the conventional gradient method in solving this specific problem .",
    "the work in this paper can be extended in several directions .",
    "the formulations in this paper can be easily extended to account for reverse power flow constraints , aggregator level renewable energy resources and aggregator controlled storage .",
    "additionally , the dr problem in this paper can be extended to incorporate the nonlinear characteristics of hot - water systems , fuel cells , micro - chp and a second order thermal model of a household . in this case , the resulting dr problem is a minlp that has a nonconvex relaxation .",
    "finally , future work will involve extending the dr problem in this paper to account for the underlying power distribution network through incorporating ac power flow and system operational constraints .",
