    "a possibility to accelerate high - intensive polarized proton beam up to 70  gev at the ihep u70 accelerator , extract it from the main ring and deliver to several experimental setups was intensively studied last time in 2005 and spring of 2006 in protvino  @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we proposed to study a wealth of single- and double - spin observables in various reactions using longitudinally and transversely polarized proton beams at u70 . unfortunately the proposal stuck in the ministry of education and science in summer 2006 .",
    "but we believe that a possibility to push the proposal still exists .    the main goal of the spascharm project is to study spin structure of the proton , starting with determination of gluon contribution into spin of the proton at large bjorken @xmath2 through study of spin effects in charmonium production .",
    "high sensibility to gluon content of the interacting particles is one of the main features of charmonia production in hadronic interactions . in case of collision of two",
    "longitudinally polarized protons it is used to define gluon polarization @xmath8 in the proton . a polarized proton beam is needed to make this study .",
    "we plan to have it at the second stage of the experiment after the measurements of single - spin asymmetries already in charmonia production have been carried out .",
    "the project has a first stage when unpolarized beams will be used .",
    "the first stage is an experiment to study single - spin asymmetries @xmath9 of light resonances consisting of @xmath10- , @xmath11- and @xmath12-valence quarks .",
    "transverse single - spin asymmetries are very well known for a long time . in the standard model qcd at leading twist level",
    "all @xmath13 .",
    "but the experiments show very big @xmath9 in the confinement region .",
    "therefore @xmath9 is very sensitive to the effects outside the @xmath14 .",
    "the known theoretical approaches ( sivers and collins effects , twist-3 effect , etc . )",
    "try to reconcile theory and experiment . to discriminate the existing theoretical approaches and to stimulate to develop the new ones , a systematic study of @xmath9 for a big number of miscellaneous inclusive and exclusive reactions",
    "is needed , especially in the confinement region , which is the most unclear for theory . to make this systematic study is the main goal of the first stage of the spascharm project .",
    "the first stage will be finalized by the measurements of @xmath9 in charmonia production .",
    "this will finally prepare the experimental setup to the second stage of the project where only one new thing will be needed - namely a polarized proton beam from u70 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we will describe the second stage of the experiment dedicated to spin effects in charmonia production with the use of polarized proton beam from u70 .",
    "after that we will describe the first stage dedicated to spin effects in light resonance production .",
    "r6.5 cm    at present only 30% of the longitudinally polarized proton spin is described by quark s spin .",
    "the other 70% of the proton spin may be explained by gluon and/or orbital momentum contributions .",
    "experiments with polarized lepton beams at cern , hera , slac have been measuring mainly quark polarization over last twenty years . compass and hermes have tried to measure gluon polarization at small @xmath2 , up to 0.1 - 0.15 .",
    "the rhic experiments star and phenix have begun to measure gluon polarization at very low @xmath2 values ( about 0.01 ) whereas gluon polarization has to be measured in the whole @xmath2 range .",
    "so in spite of many years of experiments , a detailed decomposition of the spin of the proton remains elusive - new experimental data on @xmath16 , especially at large @xmath2 are badly needed .",
    "we propose to simultaneously measure the double - spin asymmetry @xmath17 for inclusive @xmath18 and @xmath19 by utilizing the 70  gev / c longitudinally polarized - proton beam on a longitudinally polarized target .",
    "our goal is to obtain besides the quark - spin information also the gluon - spin information from these three processes in order to determine what portion of the proton spin is carried by gluons .",
    "better understanding of charmonium production at u70 energies is needed  for this pion and proton beams will be used to produce charmonium .",
    "gluon contribution into the proton spin as well as strange quarks and orbital momentum contributions  worldwide studies at hermes , compass , rhic , jlab and slac .",
    "we propose a new experiment in this field ",
    "it should be complimentary to the existing experiments .",
    "it will give new data at large @xmath2 for global analysis .",
    "one can see from fig.1 that the biggest gluon polarization is anticipated near @xmath20 .",
    "spascharm will measure gluon polarization in the region of @xmath2 between 0.3 and 0.6 .",
    "r4.2 cm    information about gluon polarization might be obtained through simultaneous measurements of @xmath17 in inclusive production of @xmath21 and @xmath19 .",
    "this experiment was proposed at fermilab ( p838 ) at 200 gev as a continuation of e704  @xcite .",
    "the fermilab s pac pointed out that physics was very interesting , but an intensity of the polarized proton beam from @xmath22-hyperon decays was small ",
    "the statistics would not be enough .",
    "the experiment was not approved . in our new proposal for u70",
    "we expect to have up to @xmath23  p / min instead of @xmath24  p / min in p838 which is a factor of 15 more .",
    "-3 mm    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     the principal point for this experiment is a separation of the two charmonia states with the spins equal to 1 and 2 , namely @xmath25  ( 3510 ) and @xmath21  ( 3555 ) .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations for 70  gev have been made .",
    "the reconstructed masses of @xmath26(3410 ) , @xmath25  ( 3510 ) and @xmath21  ( 3555 ) are presented in fig.8 . the @xmath19 ( in @xmath27-decay mode ) 4-momentum is taken as a result of @xmath28-fit . for charged particles @xmath29= 0.004 at 10 gev / c . for @xmath30-quanta @xmath31",
    "was taken as @xmath32 .",
    "we can see that the two states of interest are well separated .",
    "the spascharm experiment plans to have 25000 electronic channels ( 7000 adc , 2000 tdc and 16 000 registers ) .",
    "the trigger for interaction in the target will be the only hardware trigger .",
    "information from the interaction will be digitized in each sub - detector , pre - processed and buffered for further processing .",
    "a high level trigger selection will occur in compute nodes which access the buffers via a high bandwidth network fabric .",
    "the experiment plans to operate at interaction rates of the order of 2  mhz .",
    "with pre - processing on the detector electronics for a substantial reduction of the data volume , typical event sizes are in the range of 2 to 4  kb .",
    "this amounts to total raw data rates in the order of 3  gb / s .",
    "our estimate has shown us that we expect to get a precision of @xmath33 = 0.07 for @xmath21 and 0.025 for @xmath19 at @xmath20 for 100 days of data taking .    with the use of polarized proton beam at spascharm a precision measurement of single - spin asymmetry in inclusive production of miscellaneous resonances in the transverse polarized beam fragmentation region in a wide ( @xmath34)-region will be worthwhile . also it will be possible to measure transversity in drell - yan muon ( electron ) pairs .",
    "before the polarized proton beam will be accelerated at u70 we can make single - spin measurements of miscellaneous inclusive and exclusive reactions with unpolarized beams , such as pions , kaons and protons , existing at the beam channel 14 of the protvino accelerator . why do we need to measure @xmath9 in a big variety of inclusive and exclusive reactions ? in the standard model qcd at leading twist level all @xmath9=0 .",
    "but the experiments show very big @xmath9 in the confinement region .",
    "therefore @xmath9 is very sensitive to the effects outside the @xmath14 . the known theoretical approaches ( sivers and collins effects , twist-3 effect , etc . ) try to reconcile theory and experiment . to discriminate the existing theoretical approaches and to stimulate to develop the new ones , a systematic study of @xmath9 for a big number of miscellaneous inclusive and exclusive reactions",
    "is needed , especially in the confinement region , which is the most unclear for theory . to make this systematic study is the main goal of the first stage of the spascharm project .",
    "r8.5 cm    it would be interesting to measure single - spin asymmetries in inclusive production of light resonances even in the unpolarized beam fragmentation region , but at big values of transverse momentum @xmath35 , close to the boundary of phase space . in fig.9 the single - spin asymmetry @xmath9 in the inclusive reaction @xmath36 at 40  gev / c at @xmath370.7 is presented  @xcite .",
    "we see that @xmath9 is zero at small @xmath35 and about 15% at @xmath35 near 1  gev / c and bigger .",
    "when @xmath38 goes to 1 , any inclusive reaction transfers into the proper exclusive reaction . in fig.10",
    "the single - spin asymmetry @xmath9 in the exclusive reaction @xmath39 at 40  gev / c is presented  @xcite .",
    "we see that @xmath9 is also about 15% near @xmath40 equal to 1  ( gev / c)@xmath5 , that is equivalent to @xmath35 near 1  gev / c .",
    "so asymmetries in the both inclusive and exclusive @xmath41-production at 40  gev pion beam are equal each other ( also it seems that asymmetries on polarized protons and neutrons are the same ) .",
    "it should be the case for other light resonances .",
    "for the first stage of the experiment two multi - channel threshold cherenkov counters will be added to the setup to distinguish between pions and kaons .",
    "they are of 1.5  m and 3  m long and will be placed between the end of the magnet and the calorimeter .",
    "they will be filled by freon and by air correspondingly , both at atmospheric pressure .",
    "lead tungstate in the calorimeter is not needed for the first stage , lead glass with moderate energy resolution will be enough to detect light resonances .",
    "an acceptance of the whole setup will be decreased , however it will still be significant to detect light resonances . due to very fast",
    "daq ( practically without dead time ) inclusive and exclusive reactions will be studied simultaneously .",
    "there are some advantages of the new experiment .",
    "exclusive and inclusive reactions were studied either in neutral decay modes or in charged decay modes in the previous experiments .",
    "we propose to measure the both modes simultaneously and therefore we expect a significant increase in statistics .",
    "addition of new detectors ( gem , mdc , high quality emc etc . )",
    "compare to the previous experiments might bring us to discovery of `` new channels '' ( exotic glueballs , hybrids , etc ) .",
    "extremely high - speed daq will allow to detect inclusive and exclusive reactions simultaneously .",
    "partial wave analysis of a huge statistics on polarized target will raise a robustness of the results on rare resonances .",
    "the setup has @xmath42-acceptance on azimuthal angle @xmath43 and therefore the systematic errors in single - spin asymmetries will be negligible .",
    "r9.5 cm    one can see the advantage of proposed new measurements in sense of significant increase in statistics in a couple exclusive reactions in fig.11 and fig.12 .",
    "the details are in the figure captions .    for the mc simulations ,",
    "two options of the setup were considered with two distances from the center of the polarized target to the beam downstream end of the last cherenkov counter - `` 7 meters '' and `` 4 meters '' .",
    "variant `` 4 meters '' has one cherenkov counter in the setup .",
    "@xmath44-mesons will be identified in the momentum region of 3 - 23 gev / c .",
    "acceptance for `` usual '' ( non - strange ) resonances is huge ( 3 times bigger than for `` 7 m '' ) .",
    "we request a beam time of 30 days .",
    "variant `` 7 meters '' has two cherenkov counters in the setup and allows @xmath45-separation in the momentum region of 3 - 23 gev / c .",
    "we request a beam time of 70 days .",
    "the expected accuracies of @xmath9 in several inclusive reactions for the summing 100 days at beam in the kinematical region of @xmath46 and @xmath47  gev / c are the following for different reactions : + @xmath48 = 0.3 - 3% ; + @xmath49 = 0.2 - 2.5% ; + @xmath50 = 0.3 - 4% ; + @xmath51 = 0.1 - 1% ; + @xmath52 = 3.-10.% ; + @xmath53 = 0.6 - 10% .",
    "the new polarization program spascharm is being prepared in protvino .",
    "the program has two stages . the first stage ( to be started in 2011 )",
    "is dedicated to single - spin asymmetries in the production of miscellaneous light resonances with the use of 34  gev @xmath0-beam .",
    "inclusive and exclusive reactions will be studied simultaneously .",
    "the errors in the exclusive reactions with big asymmetries are expected to be several times less than now .",
    "the brand new data for inclusive reactions will be obtained .",
    "all the new data will much better help us to understand spin dependence of strong interaction in the most difficult from the theory point of view kinematical region , namely in the quark confinement region .    the second stage ( to be started in 2015 ) is dedicated to single - spin and double - spin asymmetries in charmonium production with the use of 70  gev polarized proton beam which will allow us to understand charmonium hadronic production mechanism and make @xmath1 extraction at large @xmath2 . the results on @xmath1 at large @xmath2 will be unique and will be complementary to those which exist and might be obtained at compass , hermes , rhic and jlab at smaller @xmath2",
