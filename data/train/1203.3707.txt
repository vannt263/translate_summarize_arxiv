    "projectile - electron excitation and loss occurring in collisions of projectile - ions with atomic targets in the non - relativistic domain of impact energies and projectile charges have been extensively studied during the last few decades ( for a review see @xcite-@xcite ) . starting with pioneering articles of bates and griffing @xcite the most of the theoretical studies of these processes",
    "have been based on the first order perturbation theory in the projectile - target interaction @xcite .",
    "in contrast to nonrelativistic collisions , in the relativistic domain of collision parameters the first consistent theoretical approaches for treating projectile - electron excitation and loss was formulated relatively recently @xcite . like in the nonrelativistic domain ,",
    "the simplest description of these processes is given by the first order theory in the interaction between the projectile and the target .",
    "this theory is strictly valid provided the following conditions are fulfilled simultaneously : i ) @xmath0 and ii ) @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the atomic numbers of the projectile and target , respectively , and @xmath4 is the collision velocity ( atomic units are used throughout except where otherwise stated ) .    in the present article",
    "we shall discuss excitation of heavy hydrogen - like projectiles in collisions with very light atoms when the condition @xmath1 is very well fulfilled but the atomic number of the projectile is so high that one has @xmath5 even for collision velocities from the relativistic domain @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the speed of light .",
    "in such a case the field of the target _ per se _ represents just a weak perturbation for the electron of the projectile .",
    "nevertheless , large higher order contributions to the projectile - electron excitation may arise `` indirectly '' since the strong field of the nucleus of the projectile can substantially distort the motion of the target electrons which in turn changes the cross section for excitation .",
    "note that some aspects of projectile - electron excitation and loss in asymmetric collisions ( @xmath8 ) have been already considered in @xcite and @xcite where eikonal - like theories of these processes were formulated for the nonrelativistic @xcite and relativistic @xcite domains .",
    "those theories , however , were based on the assumption that both in the initial and final channels the motion of the electrons of the target is mainly driven by the field of the atomic nucleus while the field of the projectile just distorts somewhat this motion . in the present article ,",
    "the work on which was triggered by a recent experiment performed at gsi ( darmstadt , germany ) @xcite , we consider the opposite case which is realized in collisions characterized by very large ( on the target scale ) momentum transfers .",
    "it turns out that under such condition it is the field of the nucleus of the projectile which is the main driving force in the collision not only for the electron of the projectile but also for those of the target .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "based on the first order theory in the projectile - target interaction , we show that in collisions with large momentum transfers the electrons and the nucleus of the target atom act incoherently behaving like quasi - free particles with respect to each other . in this section",
    "we also argue that the motion of the atomic particles in such collisions is driven primarily by the field of the nucleus of the ion and , therefore , a better ( compared to the first order ) treatment of the excitation can be obtained by describing the electrons of the atom in their initial and final states as moving in the field of the nucleus of the ion . in sections 3 and 4 we present treatments for the excitation by proton and electron impacts , respectively . in section 5",
    "the theory is illustrated by calculating cross sections for excitation of bi@xmath9 ions in relativistic collisions with hydrogen .",
    "let us consider excitation of a heavy hydrogen - like ion in collisions with light atoms .",
    "for the moment we shall assume , for the sake of simplicity , that the atom consists of a nucleus with a charge @xmath3 and just one electron .    it can be shown ( see e.g. @xcite ) that within the first order approximation in the ion - atom interaction the cross section for the ion - atom collision reads @xmath10 here , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are initial and final internal energies of the ion , respectively and @xmath13 is the 3-momentum transferred to the ion ; all the quantities are given in the rest frame of the ion .",
    "we also introduce quantities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 which have similar meanings but are for the atom and given in the rest frame of the atom .",
    "the momentum transfers are defined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the two - dimensional part of the momentum transferred to the atom , which is perpendicular to the collision velocity @xmath20 , and the components of the momentum transfers along the collision velocity read @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the collisional lorentz factor",
    ". the inelastic 4-component form - factor of the ion ( in the ion frame ) and the 4-component form - factor of the atom ( in the atom frame ) are given by @xmath23 @xmath24 respectively ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "in eq.([a3 ] ) @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the initial and final internal states of the ion , @xmath28 the coordinates of the ion electron with respect to the ion nucleus and @xmath29 the dirac matrices for the electron of the ion . in eq.([a4 ] ) @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the initial and final internal states of the atom , and @xmath32 are the coordinates of the atomic electron with respect to the atomic nucleus .    if one is interested only in the electron transitions in the ion , without knowing what occurs with the atom in the collision , then one has to consider the cross section @xmath33 where the sum runs over all possible internal states of the atom including its initial state and the atomic continuum .",
    "the cross section ( [ a5 ] ) can be conveniently written as the sum of the contributions from the elastic ( @xmath34 ) and inelastic ( @xmath35 ) atomic collision modes @xmath36 where the sum over @xmath37 , which represents the contribution from the inelastic atomic mode , includes also the sum over the continuum states of the atom .    in collisions resulting in excitation of heavy hydrogen - like ions",
    "the momentum transfer to the atom @xmath38 can , under certain conditions , be much larger than the typical momentum ( @xmath39 ) of the electron bound in the atom . from the second equation in ( [ a2 ] ) one may see that this will be certainly the case when @xmath40 . taking into account that @xmath41 we obtain that provided the condition @xmath42 is fulfilled , the collision will always be characterized by momentum transfers to the atom which are very large on the scale of the latter .",
    "this enables one to greatly simplify and , as we shall see below , also to improve the description of the excitation of the ion . in what follows",
    "we shall assume that the condition ( [ a7 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "let us first consider the elastic atomic mode . in this mode ,",
    "because of the rapidly oscillating exponent @xmath43 , the atomic elastic form - factors can be approximated by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",
    "then , taking into account ( [ a1 ] ) , we obtain @xmath46 let us now turn to the inelastic atomic mode . because the momentum transferred to the atom is large , the inelastic form - factors of the atom ( [ a3 ] ) may be not small only provided the final state @xmath47 is a continuum state in which the momentum of the outgoing atomic electron @xmath48 is approximately equal to the momentum transfer @xmath49 .",
    "only then the rapidly oscillating exponent @xmath43 in the integrands of eqs .",
    "( [ a3 ] ) could be compensated by a similar factor @xmath50 which is contained in the state @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "further , since in order to `` balance '' the large @xmath49 the momentum of the emitted electron has to be as large ( and thus @xmath53 ) , its motion can be to a good approximation described by replacing the coulomb atomic wave @xmath51 by a corresponding plane wave .",
    "physically it means that the electron of the atom in the collision process can be treated as quasi - free with respect to the nucleus of the atom and that the initial bound nature of the electron is reflected in the process merely by the compton profile of the state @xmath54 , which appears in the consideration in a natural way once the state @xmath51 has been approximated by a plane wave .",
    "taking into account also the consideration of the elastic atomic mode we arrive at a rather simple picture of the collision process . in this picture , due to",
    "very large momentum transfers involved , the excitation of the ion is produced by the independent ( incoherent ) actions of the two quasi - free particles  the nucleus and the electron  constituting initially the atom .",
    "one has , however , to keep in mind the following .",
    "large momentum transfers are caused by a very large difference between the initial and final energies of the electron of the ion .",
    "this difference is in turn the consequence of a very high charge of the nucleus of the ion . because of the latter the field produced by the nucleus of the ion in the collision can be so strong that it may determine the character of the motion of the electron of the atom in the excitation process .    in order to see this",
    "let us make some simple estimates .",
    "this is convenient to do in the rest frame of the ion .",
    "the range of impact parameters @xmath55 of the incident atomic electron with respect to the nucleus of the ion , which are typical for the excitation process , can be roughly estimated by comparing the collision time @xmath56 ( @xmath57 is the velocity of the atomic electron with respect to the nucleus of the ion and @xmath58 the corresponding lorentz factor ) with the transition time @xmath59 of the electron of the ion .",
    "since for the excitation to proceed effectively one needs @xmath60 , we obtain @xmath61 . on the other hand , by comparing the force , which acts between the atomic electron and the nucleus of the atom , with the force exerted on this electron by the nucleus of the ion , we see that the latter will be the dominant one when the atomic electron enters the sphere , which is centered on the nucleus of the ion and has the radius @xmath62 ( where @xmath63 is the size of the atom ) . therefore , provided the inequality @xmath64 , which can be written in the form @xmath65 is fulfilled the motion of the atomic electron in the projectile - electron excitation process will be predominantly governed by the field of the nucleus of the ion . comparing ( [ ion - main - field ] ) and ( [ a7 ] ) and taking into account that @xmath66 ( or @xmath67 ) , we see that in collisions with momentum transfers , which are very large on the scale of the atom , the condition ( [ ion - main - field ] ) is indeed always fulfilled .    provided the condition ( [ a7 ] ) is fulfilled , the main interaction acting on the nucleus of the atom in the collision process is of course also due to the field of the nucleus of the ion .",
    "a simple estimate for the magnitude of the effect of the field of the ionic nucleus on the motion of the electrons and the nucleus of the atom in the process of excitation can be obtained in the following way .",
    "assume that there is a particle with a charge @xmath68 and mass @xmath69 which is incident with a velocity @xmath4 on the nucleus @xmath2 .",
    "the change in the momentum of this particle caused by the field of @xmath2 is roughly given by @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the impact parameter .",
    "for the problem of excitation the typical impact parameters are of the order of @xmath72 or larger .",
    "one can estimate the effect of the field by using the ratio @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the initial momentum of the incident particle and , thus , @xmath75 from this estimate it is obvious that for the impact energies of interest the field of the nucleus of the ion does not really affect the motion of the nucleus of the atom but may very strongly change the motion of the atomic electrons .",
    "the first order cross section ( [ a1 ] ) , with which we have started our current discussion , of course does not take into account the effect of the nucleus of the ion on the motion of the electrons of the atom .",
    "besides , this cross section also does not account for the exchange effect of the atomic and ionic electrons .",
    "we , however , have already seen that in very asymmetric collisions the general two - center problem of excitation can be reduced to a single - center one in which only one center of force  the nucleus of the ion  is effectively present .",
    "therefore , one can improve our description of the excitation process in collisions with large momentum transfers if , instead of regarding the atomic electrons as ( quasi- ) free , we would treat these electrons , both their initial and final states , as moving in the field of the nucleus of the ion and , besides , would take into account the exchange effect .",
    "in such an approach the cross section for the excitation of a heavy highly charged ion in collisions with an atom is given by the incoherent addition of the cross sections for excitation by the impacts of the atomic nucleus and electrons .",
    "this means that , if one would be able to compute the cross sections for the excitation by protons and electrons , one could use them ( after averaging the cross section for excitation by electron impact over the compton profile of the atomic electrons ) for evaluating excitation cross sections in collisions with atoms .",
    "therefore , in the next two sections we shall discuss excitation of heavy hydrogen - like ions in collisions with protons and electrons .",
    "let us now turn to the consideration of excitation of heavy hydrogen - like ion in collisions with protons .",
    "the charge of the proton is much smaller than that of the highly charged nucleus of the ion .",
    "this means that the interaction between the proton and the electron of the ion in the process of excitation is much weaker than the interaction between the electron and the ionic nucleus and , hence , can be treated as a weak perturbation .",
    "further , the proton mass is much heavier than that of the electron and , as was already mentioned , for collision energies of interest for the present study the influence of the field of the ionic nucleus on the proton motion can be ignored .",
    "therefore , regarding the proton as a dirac particle , one can approximate the initial and final states of the proton by ( dirac ) plane - waves .    in our consideration",
    "the nucleus of the ion will be taken as infinitely heavy representing , thus , just an external field .",
    "we shall work in the rest frame of this nucleus and choose its position as the origin .",
    "taking all the above into account the transition amplitude for the excitation of the ion by proton impact can be written according to @xmath76 here , @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) are the electromagnetic transition 4-currents generated by the electron of the ion at a space - time point @xmath80 and by the proton at a space - time point @xmath81 , respectively , and @xmath82 is the propagator of the electromagnetic field which transmits the interaction between these particles . the contravariant @xmath83 and covariant @xmath84 @xmath85-vectors",
    "are given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "the metric tensor @xmath88 of the four - dimensional space is defined by @xmath89 and @xmath90 for @xmath91 . in ( [ e1 ] )",
    "the summation over the repeated greek indices is implied .",
    "the transition currents of the electron and proton are given by @xmath92 and @xmath93 respectively , where @xmath94 are the gamma - matrices . in eq.([e3 ] ) the vector @xmath95 denotes the electron coordinates , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the initial and final states of the electron with total energies @xmath98 and @xmath99 , respectively .",
    "these states describe the motion of the electron in the field of the nucleus of the ion .",
    "further , @xmath100 are the coordinates of the proton , @xmath101 and @xmath102 are the initial and final states of the proton with corresponding total energies @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "these states describe a free proton with a given value of spin projection .    by applying the fourier transformation to the currents and the photon propagator in the integrand of ( [ e1 ] )",
    "the transition amplitude can be rewritten in a more convenient form @xmath105 where @xmath106    due to the relatively large mass of the proton the change in its initial momentum caused by the collision is much smaller than the initial momentum itself . as a result",
    ", the proton not only moves in the collision practically along a straight line but also , as one can easily show , the change in the direction of its spin is very unlikely .",
    "taking this into account , assuming for definiteness that the proton moves initially along the @xmath68-axis and using the explicit form of the dirac plane - wave states for the proton its current in eqs.([e5 ] ) can be greatly simplified resulting in @xmath107 in the above equations @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the initial and final momenta of the proton , respectively , ( @xmath110 ) and @xmath4 is the proton velocity with respect to the nucleus , which to excellent accuracy remains a constant in the collision .    using eqs .",
    "( [ e4 ] ) and ( [ e6 ] ) and the expression for the electron transition current from eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) the transition amplitude is obtained to be @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the momentum transfer to the ion , @xmath113 is the dirac matrix and the delta - function expresses the energy conservation in the collision .    using the well known procedure in order to obtain the cross section from the transition amplitude for the excitation cross section differential in the momentum transfer we get @xmath114 in the above consideration we have already used the fact that the change in the momentum of the proton caused by the collision is very small compared to its initial value . using this fact again",
    "one can show that , to an excellent accuracy , the change in the proton energy is very simply related to the @xmath68-component , @xmath115 , of the momentum transfer vector @xmath116 : @xmath117 .",
    "this enables us to integrate the cross section ( [ e8 ] ) over @xmath115 and obtain @xmath118 where @xmath119 with @xmath19 being the transverse part of the momentum transfer ( @xmath120 ) and @xmath121 is the minimum momentum transfer in the collision .",
    "it is not difficult to see that the only difference between the cross section ( [ a8 ] ) , obtained in the previous section , and the cross section ( [ e9 ] ) and is that the latter was derived by assuming @xmath122 .",
    "the initial and final bound states of the electron in ( [ e9 ] ) are given by @xmath123 and @xmath124 respectively .",
    "( [ e12 ] ) and ( [ e13 ] ) @xmath125 ( @xmath126 ) are the large ( small ) components of the radial dirac - coulomb states of the electron in the field of the nucleus with a charge @xmath2 .    if we denote @xmath127 , where @xmath128 is the fine structure constant , and @xmath129 , then the energies and the radial wave functions of the bound states are given , respectively , by ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath130^{-\\frac{1}{2 } }   \\label{e14 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath131 .",
    "\\label{e15 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the gamma function and confluent hypergeometric function @xcite , respectively , @xmath134 is the electron compton wavelength , @xmath135^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$ ] , @xmath136 is the principal quantum number and the quantity @xmath137 is related to the orbital momentum @xmath138 and the total angular momentum @xmath139 by @xmath140 further , @xmath141 are the normalized spin - angular functions ( see e.g. @xcite ) which read @xmath142 where @xmath143 are the pauli spinors and @xmath144 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "like in the case of collisions with protons , the interaction between the incident electron and the electron of the ion is comparatively very weak . therefore , this interaction can be treated as arising due to just single - photon exchange between the electrons",
    ".    however , there are in general two important differences between the excitation of a highly charged ion by proton and electron impacts .",
    "first , the mass of an electron is much lighter than that of a proton . as a result ,",
    "in contrast to the proton case , the motion of the incident ( and scattered ) electron can be very substantially distorted by its interaction with the nucleus of the ion .",
    "second , since the electrons are indistinguishable , the exchange effect has to be taken into account .",
    "the first point can be addressed by describing not only the bound but also the continuum electron as moving in the coulomb field of the nucleus of the ion .",
    "the second point leads to the necessity to include an additional first order diagram ( the so called exchange diagram ) into the theoretical treatment of electron - impact excitation .    taking all the above into account the transition amplitude for electron - impact excitation",
    "is given by @xmath145 where @xmath146 and @xmath147 are the direct and exchange contributions , respectively , to the total transition amplitude .",
    "similarly to the case of proton impact for the direct contribution one can obtain @xmath148 where @xmath149 describes the current generated by the electron in its bound - bound transition in the ion and @xmath150 represent the current generated by the incident and scattered electron with asymptotic momenta @xmath151 and @xmath152 , respectively , ( continuum - continuum transition ) .",
    "the exchange part of the transition amplitude reads @xmath153 in this expression @xmath154 describes the current generated by the electron , which was initially bound in the ion and emitted during the collision having asymptotically a momentum @xmath152 ( bound - continuum transition ) .",
    "further , @xmath155 represent the current generated by the electron , which was initially incident on the ion with an asymptotic momentum @xmath151 and become bound in the collision ( continuum - bound transition ) .    in the above expressions the form of the bound states",
    "is given , as before , by eqs .",
    "( [ e12])-([e16 ] ) .",
    "the continuum states ( the incident and scattered electron(s ) ) are described using the corresponding dirac wave function in the coulomb field of the nucleus of the ion .",
    "namely , for the incident electron which propagates initially in the positive z - axis direction @xmath156 and has spin projection @xmath157 one has @xmath158 the state of the scattered electron , which asymptotically has a momentum @xmath152 and spin projection @xmath157 , reads @xmath159    the radial wave functions @xmath160 and @xmath161 are given by @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the sommerfeld parameter , the coulomb phase shift @xmath164 is defined by the relation @xmath165 and @xmath166 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in expression ( [ continuum ] ) the notations @xmath167 and @xmath168 mean that one has to take the real or the imaginary part , respectively , of its second line .",
    "figure [ inel_mode ] shows the contribution of the inelastic target mode to the cross sections for excitation of bi@xmath169(1s ) projectiles into the @xmath170-shell occurring in collisions with atomic hydrogen : bi@xmath169(1s ) @xmath171 h(1s ) @xmath172 bi@xmath169(@xmath173 ) @xmath174 p@xmath175 + e@xmath176 .",
    "the figure contains two sets of the theoretical results .",
    "one of them , depicted by dash curves , was obtained by using the first order of perturbation theory in the projectile - target interaction .",
    "the other one , displayed by solid curves , was calculated by treating the target electron in the inelastic mode as quasi - free with respect to the target nucleus but taking into account the distortion of its motion by the field of the nucleus of the projectile and also the exchange effect between the electrons of the target and projectile ( see section 4 ) .    as it follows from figure [ inel_mode ]",
    ", there is a large difference between these two sets of the cross sections with the distorted - wave model yielding substantially higher cross sections .",
    "this is especially obvious in the case of the excitation of the @xmath177@xmath178 transition where even at an impact energy as high as @xmath179 mev / u the difference still reaches a factor of @xmath180 .",
    "the origin of this difference may lie in the strong attraction between the electron of the atom and the nucleus of the ion which increases the probability for the atomic electron to come closer to the electron of the ion .",
    "such a `` focusing '' could be especially effective namely in the excitation of the @xmath177@xmath178 transition since the latter needs small impact parameters in order to proceed .    when the impact energy increases the distortion of the motion of the incident electron in general weakens",
    ". however , according to the results shown in figure [ inel_mode ] the distortion presents a substantial factor for all energies from the range considered and the difference in the cross sections remains quite substantial .        in figure [ elect - prot ]",
    "we compare the cross sections for excitation of bi@xmath169(1s ) ions by the impact of the proton and electron which have ( initially ) equal velocities with respect to the ion .",
    "note that according to the present approach these cross sections also correspond to the contributions to the excitation by the elastic ( proton ) and inelastic ( electron ) target modes in collisions with atomic hydrogen .",
    "it is seen that in the interval of collision velocities considered in the figure the results for excitation by electrons and protons are rather different . in particular , despite the incident protons possess kinetic energy , which is by three orders of magnitude larger than that of the equivelocity electrons , it turns out that the latter ones can be more effective in exciting the @xmath177@xmath178 and @xmath177@xmath181 transitions .",
    "the `` superiority '' of the electrons in the excitation process is most substantial for the @xmath177@xmath178 transition for which the electron is more efficient by a factor of @xmath182 at the lower boundary of the velocity interval .",
    "the origin of this difference most likely lies in a very strong distortion of the motion of the incident electron by the field of the nucleus of the ion .",
    "while the heavy proton moves in the collision practically undeflected the strong attraction of the light incident electron by the field of the ion increases the probability for this electron to come closer to the location of the bound electron . since the @xmath177 @xmath178 transition , as a non - dipole one , occurs at small impact parameters , the `` focusing '' of the incident electron by the field of the nucleus may increase the chances for the excitation .",
    "we have considered excitation of highly charged hydrogen - like ions in relativistic collisions with light atoms in which the momentum transfer to the atom is very large on the typical atomic scale . in the process of excitation in such collisions",
    "the nucleus and the electrons of the atom behave as quasi - free particles with respect to each other and it is the field of the nucleus of the ion which is the main force acting on them .",
    "therefore , excitation of the ion essentially proceeds via two distinct reaction pathways , which involve the collision of the electron of the ion either with the atomic nucleus or with the atomic electrons , whose contributions add up incoherently in the cross section .",
    "since the nucleus of the atom is much heavier than the electron , its motion remains practically not distorted by the interaction with the field of the nucleus of the ion . because of that and also due to the condition @xmath8 the contribution to the excitation of the ion , caused by the interaction with the nucleus of the atom , can be evaluated already within the first order perturbation theory in the interaction between the nucleus of the atom and the projectile - ion .",
    "contrary to this , the field of the nucleus of the projectile in collisions with large momentum transfer has a crucial impact on the motion of the electrons of the atom .",
    "therefore , for a proper description of the excitation by atomic electrons one needs to take into account the distortion of their states both in the initial and final reaction channels .",
    "besides , since there is in general a noticeable overlap between the phase spaces of the electron of the ion and those of the atom the exchange effect between them has to be taken into account .",
