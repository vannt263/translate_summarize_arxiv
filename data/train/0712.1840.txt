    "this paper is an enlarged version of the three lectures we gave in july 2007 during the summer school _ higher dimensional geometry over finite fields _ , june 25 - july 06 , 2007 , mathematisches",
    "institut , georg - august - universitt gttingen .",
    "the goal of the paper is to provide to non - specialists an _ efficient , accessible , and in depth _ introduction to the theory of _ integral models _ of _ shimura varieties of hodge type_. accordingly , the paper will put a strong accent on defining the main objects of interest , on listing the main problems , on presenting the main techniques used in approaching the main problems , and on stating very explicitly the main results obtained so far .",
    "this is not an easy task , as only to be able to list the main problems one requires a good comprehension of the _ language of schemes _ , of _ reductive groups _ , of _ abelian varieties _ , of _ hodge cycles _ on abelian varieties , of",
    "_ cohomology theories _ ( including _ tale and crystalline _ ones ) , of _ deformation theories _ , of _ @xmath0-divisible groups _ , and of _",
    "@xmath1-crystals_. whenever possible , proofs are included .",
    "we begin with a motivation for the study of shimura varieties of hodge type .",
    "let @xmath2 be a connected , smooth , projective variety over @xmath3 .",
    "we recall that the _ albanese variety _ of @xmath2 is an abelian variety @xmath4 over @xmath3 equipped with a morphism @xmath5 that has the following universal property .",
    "if @xmath6 is another morphism from @xmath2 to an abelian variety @xmath7 over @xmath3 , then there exists a unique morphism @xmath8 such that the following identity @xmath9 holds .",
    "this universal property determines @xmath4 uniquely up to isomorphisms .",
    "not only @xmath4 is uniquely determined by @xmath2 , but also the image @xmath10 is uniquely determined by @xmath2 up to isomorphisms . thus to @xmath2 one associates an abelian variety @xmath4 over @xmath3 as well as a closed subvariety @xmath10 of it . if @xmath2 belongs to a good class @xmath11 of connected , smooth , projective varieties over @xmath3 , then deformations of @xmath2 would naturally give birth to deformations of the closed embedding @xmath12 .",
    "thus the study of moduli spaces of objects of the class @xmath11 is very much related to the study of moduli spaces of abelian schemes endowed with certain closed subschemes ( which naturally give birth to some polarizations ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath2 is a curve of positive genus , then @xmath13 and the morphism @xmath14 is a closed embedding ; to this embedding one associates naturally a principal polarization of @xmath15 .",
    "this implies that different moduli spaces of geometrically connected , smooth , projective curves are subspaces of different moduli spaces of principally polarized abelian schemes .    for the sake of generality and flexibility",
    ", it does not suffice to study moduli spaces of abelian schemes endowed with polarizations and with certain closed subschemes .",
    "more precisely , one is naturally led to study moduli spaces of polarized abelian schemes endowed with _",
    "families _ of _ hodge cycles_. they are called _ shimura varieties of hodge type _ ( see subsection 3.4 ) . the classical _ hodge conjecture _",
    "predicts that each hodge cycle is an _ algebraic cycle_.",
    "thus we refer to subsection 2.5 for a quick introduction to hodge cycles on abelian schemes over reduced @xmath16schemes .",
    "subsections 2.1 to 2.5 review basic properties of algebraic groups , of hodge structures , and of families of tensors .    _ shimura varieties _ can be defined abstractly via few axioms due to deligne ( see subsection 3 ) .",
    "they are in natural bijection to _ shimura pairs _ @xmath17 .",
    "here @xmath18 is a reductive group over @xmath16 and @xmath2 is a hermitian symmetric domain whose points form a @xmath19-conjugacy class of homomorphisms @xmath20 of real groups , that are subject to few axioms .",
    "initially one gets a complex shimura variety @xmath21 defined over @xmath3 ( see subsection 3.1 ) .",
    "the totally discontinuous , locally compact group @xmath22 acts naturally on @xmath21 from the right .",
    "cumulative works of shimura , taniyama , deligne , borovoi , milne , etc . , have proved that @xmath21 has a _ canonical model _ @xmath23 over a number field @xmath24 which is intrinsically associated to the shimura pair @xmath17 and which is called the",
    "_ reflex field _ of @xmath17 ( see subsection 3.2 ) .",
    "one calls @xmath23 together with the natural right action of @xmath22 on it , as the shimura variety defined by the shimura pair @xmath17 . for instance , if @xmath25 and @xmath26 is isomorphic to two copies of the upper half - plane , then @xmath23 is the _",
    "elliptic modular variety _ over @xmath16 and is the projective limit indexed by @xmath27 of the _ affine modular curves _",
    "@xmath28 .",
    "let @xmath29 be a compact , open subgroup of @xmath22 .",
    "the quotient scheme @xmath30 exists and is a normal , quasi - projective scheme over @xmath24 . if @xmath31 is a prime of @xmath24 of residue field @xmath32 and if @xmath33 is a good integral model of @xmath30 over the local ring @xmath34 of @xmath31 , then one gets a shimura variety @xmath35 over the finite field @xmath32 .",
    "the classical example of a good integral model is _ mumford moduli scheme _ @xmath36 .",
    "here @xmath37 , the @xmath38-scheme @xmath36 is the _ course moduli scheme _ of principally polarized abelian scheme of relative dimension @xmath39 , and the @xmath16scheme @xmath40 is of the form @xmath30 for @xmath17 a shimura pair that defines ( see example 3.1.2 ) a _ siegel modular variety_.    in this paper , we are mainly interested in shimura varieties of hodge type .",
    "roughly speaking , they are those shimura varieties for which one can naturally choose @xmath33 to be a finite scheme over @xmath41 . in this paper",
    "we study @xmath33 and its special fibre @xmath35 .",
    "see subsections 4.1 and 4.2 for some moduli interpretations of @xmath33 .",
    "see section 5 for different results pertaining to the uniqueness of @xmath33 . see section 6 for basic results that pertain to the smooth locus of @xmath33 .",
    "see section 7 for the list of cases in which @xmath33 is known to be ( or it is expected to be ) a projective @xmath34-scheme .",
    "section 8 presents four main stratifications of the ( smooth locus of the ) special fibre @xmath35 and their basic properties .",
    "these four stratifications are defined by ( see subsections 8.3 , 8.4 , 8.6 , and 8.7 respectively ) :    newton polygons of @xmath0-divisible groups ;    isomorphism classes of principally quasi - polarized @xmath1-isocrystals with tensors ;    inner isomorphism classes of the reductions modulo integral powers of @xmath0 of principally quasi - polarized @xmath1-crystals with tensors ;    isomorphism classes of principally quasi - polarized @xmath1-crystals with tensors .    the principally quasi - polarized @xmath1-crystals with tensors attached naturally to points of the smooth locus of @xmath35 with values in algebraically closed fields are introduced in subsection 8.1 . generalities on stratifications of reduced schemes over fields are presented in subsection 8.2 .",

    "quasi shimura @xmath0-variety of hodge type _ in the sense of [ va5 , def .",
    "subsection 8.5 is used in subsections 8.6 and 8.7 to define the last two stratifications , called the _",
