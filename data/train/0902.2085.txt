    "a number of authors have suggested a close connection between agn @xmath0-ray and radio emission , with the strong energetics of the jetted relativistic outflow being responsible for accelerating particles to the high energies needed for @xmath0-ray production ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the egret results , however , were limited by the sensitivity of the telescope and the erratic sampling of observations .",
    "this did not allow a full systematic comparison of the @xmath0-ray and radio properties for a complete sample of blazars .",
    "@xcite carried out 43  ghz very long baseline array ( vlba ) monitoring of a sample of egret blazars and concluded that @xmath0-ray events originate in parsec - scale radio knots that move down the jet at apparent superluminal speeds .",
    "@xcite supported this finding on the basis of 37  ghz total flux density single - dish monitoring observations of egret blazars .",
    "they concluded that the highest levels of @xmath0-ray emission are observed during the initial or peak stages of radio / mm - wave flares .",
    "vlba observations of a radio - selected sample of bright extragalactic sources at 15  ghz @xcite have shown that jets of egret - detected blazars are more compact , contain faster - moving knots , and are more luminous and more linearly polarized than non - egret blazars .",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) was not found .    the _ fermi gamma - ray space telescope _ ( previously known as _ glast _  )",
    "was successfully launched in june  2008 .",
    "one of the two instruments on board the space craft , the large area telescope ( lat , * ? ? ?",

    "its characteristics allow for a quasi - continuous systematic study of the whole @xmath0-ray sky with unprecedented sensitivity .",
    "the _ fermi _  lat team has recently released results of the first three months of observations ( august  october 2008 ) in the form of a bright source list @xcite . in this letter",
    "we compare the @xmath0-ray and parsec - scale radio properties of the initial ( @xmath1 ) lat agn detections that are positionally associated with bright radio - loud blazars @xcite .",
    "we call this sample throughout the paper ` elbs '  extragalactic lat bright source sample .    throughout this letter",

    "the mojave sample of 135 extragalactic radio sources was rigorously selected on the basis of the parsec - scale flux density at 15 ghz ( @xmath7  jy ) , and is part of an ongoing monitoring program with the vlba at this frequency ( for details , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the sample consists of the brightest extragalactic jets north of declination @xmath8 , and is dominated by blazars ( 101 quasars and 22 bl  lac objects ) .",
    "thirty one agn from this sample are reported by the _ fermi _",
    "lat team in the 3-month _ fermi _  lat bright @xmath0-ray source list @xcite",
    ". the mojave program also began , in late 2008 , to monitor weaker lat - detected agn ( flux density @xmath9  jy with @xmath10 ) , some of these were used for the analysis in ",
    "[ s : gr ] , where we supplement the mojave complete sample with 46 other lat - detected agn with @xmath9  jy .",
    "we emphasize that the sources plotted in figure  [ f : f_corr ] do not represent a complete sample selected on either parsec - scale radio or gamma - ray flux , but this figure does show the best available comparison at this time .",
    "we also note that many lat - detected bl  lacs @xcite are radio weak and do not enter our radio - selected sample and analysis .",
    "we have attempted to use radio data that are contemporaneous with the lat measurements , to avoid , as much as possible , effects due to variability .",
    "we use vlba observations made during may  december  2008 for most of the sources . for the remaining objects",
    "not observed then at the vlba , we use recent data from ratan-600 observations in september / october 2008 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) or the umrao observations in august  2008  january 2009 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we infer the 15 ghz parsec - scale flux density with the assumption that the total single - dish flux well represents the parsec - scale emission .",
    "we used previous ratan results together with the vlba calibrator survey ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) to confirm this assumption , following the compactness analysis by @xcite .",
    "several sources with no vlba flux density measurements but with strong kiloparsec - scale emission were not included in the analysis .",
    "if a source was observed more then once by ratan or umrao , an average value is used . note that @xcite have compared flux density scales of the three programs run at the vlba , the umrao , and ratan , and found that they agree within the errors , that typically are 5  per  cent .",
    "in addition to these quasi - simultaneous measurements of the radio flux densities , we have used in the analysis in   [ s : results ] ( i ) the results from our earlier 15 ghz flux density measurements within the 2cmvlba / mojave program presented by @xcite , and ( ii ) brightness temperature measurements of the jet cores made since 1999 @xcite and recently updated by @xcite .",
    "we did not restrict the analysis in galactic latitude , @xmath11 ; but galactic plane emission does decrease the lat detection sensitivity for @xmath12 @xcite , and this could bias our conclusions . to test this",
    "we re - did our analysis for @xmath13 , and achieved the same results at approximately the same confidence level in every single test .",
    "we also note that the two brightest radio lenses on the sky which were detected by _",
    "lat , b0218@xmath14357 and pks1830@xmath15211 , are not included in the mojave sample @xcite and are not part of the analysis in this paper .",
    "figure  [ f : f_corr ] plots the average photon flux measured by the lat @xcite in the energy range 100  mev  1  gev during three months in august ",
    "october , 2008 , against the parsec - scale radio flux density , @xmath16 , measured by the vlba at 15  ghz within several months of the lat observations , namely between may  2008 and december  2008 .",
    "this is calculated as the total flux density over the entire vlba image .",
    "vlba data points for 38 sources are supplemented by single - dish measurements for 39 objects as discussed in   [ s : obs ] .",
    "the points in figure  [ f : f_corr ] represent the agn in the elbs list ( @xmath1 lat detections ) with radio flux density greater than 0.2  jy and declination @xmath17 .",
    "this sample is about two times larger than the elbs - mojave sample .",
    "we note that the redshift distribution of the latter is not statistically different from that of the full elbs sample @xcite .",
    "the non - parametric kendall s tau test confirms a positive correlation in figure  [ f : f_corr ] at a confidence level @xmath18  per  cent for the 100  mev  1  gev energy band .",
    "the test provides the same result when restricted to only those sources measured by the vlba ( confidence 99.5  per  cent ) or when restricted to the radio brightest mojave - elbs sources ( confidence 99.1  per  cent ) or when restricted to elbs quasars only ( confidence 98.9  per  cent ) . see discussion on the possible bias by bl  lacs in @xcite .",
    "the same analysis for the second lat energy band , 1100  gev , also shows a positive correlation , but at a lower confidence level , 86  per  cent .",
    "these results indicate a direct relation between the @xmath0-ray and parsec - scale synchrotron radiation .",
    "we note that @xcite found a much less significant correlation using non - simultaneous total radio ( vla ) flux density in their @xmath0-ray selected sample . in terms of previous egret results , it is possible that a positive correlation was not found by , e.g. , @xcite in the egret vs.radio analyses because of the lack of homogeneous statistics , limited egret sensitivity and/or use of non - simultaneous measurements in the two bands . a more thorough analysis with direct implications for the emission models will be possible when the lat @xmath0-ray energy flux data become available .",
    "the correlation reported in   [ s : gr ] is further supported by the comparison of the average radio flux density of the objects detected by _ fermi _  to that of the non - detected sources for the complete mojave sample .",
    "we assume that lat non - detected objects have statistically lower photon flux and therefore should have lower radio flux .",
    "we analyzed this with 114 vlba data points and 21 single - dish measurements made in 2008 for the complete mojave sample .",
    "the @xmath16 radio flux densities of parsec - scale jets detected by _ fermi _  ( elbs sources ) are higher ( mean value 3.0  jy vs.  1.6  jy ) and have a different distribution from the non - detected ones as indicated by the kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test at a confidence level 99.9  per  cent ( figure  [ f : rflux ] ) .",
    "the mojave database contains a complete set of all calibrated vlba observations of the mojave sources since 1999 and includes data which we reduced from the public nrao archive in addition to our own observations @xcite .",
    "this provides us with an estimate of the mean flux density state of each source , @xmath19 , over the previous eight years , between january  1999 and september  2007 .",
    "we have made the same statistical test as above , flux of lat - detected vs.  lat non - detected , using @xmath19 .",
    "the general conclusion remains the same as indicated by the k - s confidence 99.5  per  cent , although the difference between elbs and non - elbs sources becomes less pronounced .",
    "the difference is also found at the 99.6  per  cent k - s confidence for distributions of the 2008 radio luminosity , @xmath20 , if compared for mojave quasars only ( figure  [ f : l08q ] ) .",
    "bl  lacs in the mojave sample have statistically lower redshifts @xcite and were excluded from the luminosity analysis .",
    "finally , an intriguing result emerges if we examine the radio activity level of the elbs sources by comparing the flux density measurements in 2008 , @xmath16 , with the respective averages over previous eight years , @xmath19 .",
    "we define the 2008 parsec - scale activity index as @xmath21 .",
    "the elbs list includes a flag that indicates whether or not the source displays significant @xmath0-ray variability during the first 3 months of lat observations @xcite . in figure",
    "[ f : rvar ] , we plot the distributions of our radio activity index @xmath22 for three classes of sources , based on their lat detection and lat variability flag .",
    "the distributions indicate that radio - selected blazars were more likely to be detected in @xmath0-rays by the lat if they were in a particularly active radio state in may  december , 2008 .",
    "the average radio activity index @xmath22 for the non - elbs mojave sources is @xmath23 . for all elbs - mojave sources",
    "it is @xmath24 , and it rises to @xmath25 if elbs - mojave sources with the lat variability flag only are selected .",
    "the k - s test confirms , at a 99.0  per  cent confidence , that the elbs and non - elbs mojave sources have different distributions of @xmath22 .",
    "the confidence level rises to 99.7  per  cent if @xmath22 distribution for confirmed @xmath0-ray variabile elbs objects are compared to non - elbs .",
    "our conclusions stay the same even if a few outliers with very high radio activity index @xmath26 are excluded from the analysis . in this case",
    ", the average @xmath22 values decrease to @xmath27 ( elbs - mojave ) and @xmath28 ( elbs - mojave with the @xmath0-ray variability flag ) . and we find the following confidence level of the k - s test for the @xmath22 distribution : 97.2  per  cent for elbs vs.  non - elbs , 99.5  per  cent for elbs confirmed variable vs.  non - elbs .",
    "the fact that the average value of @xmath22 for the entire mojave sample ( @xmath29 ) is close to zero demonstrates a lack of overall bias .",
    "it is important to note that the same @xmath30 activity analysis was performed for vlba data prior to 2008 and has shown no significant difference between elbs and non - elbs mojave sources .",
    "thus we observe a radio activity index significantly greater than zero for the elbs sources _ only _ for the time interval of vlba observations which roughly coincides with the elbs detections .",
    "this temporal coincidence suggests that the @xmath0-rays are produced in a region close to or coincident with the radio core where radio flares originate ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , more densely sampled @xmath0-ray _ fermi _  lat  radio vlbi and/or single dish monitoring is necessary to establish this robustly as the apparent time compression in relativistic jets can be quite large .",
    "the frequency dependent opacity effect which delays radio flares should also be accounted for .",
    "our conclusion is supported by the fact that we find extremely few blazars in their low radio activity state to be @xmath0-ray bright .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the elbs sources in figure  [ f : rvar ] with no variability flag ( grey shading ) span both moderate and high @xmath22 states .",
    "this suggests that agn in this category might consist of both true @xmath0-ray non - variable objects as well as moderately flaring ones .",
    "further insight into the @xmath0-ray / radio jet connection can be obtained by examining the radio core brightness temperature @xmath31 .",
    "we have calculated median values of @xmath31 for the mojave sample for the period 1999 - 2007 @xcite . in less than 20  per  cent of the cases only a lower limit could be found ; this group of sources includes two elbs objects .",
    "gehan s generalized wilcoxon test from the asurv survival analysis package @xcite indicates , at a 99.9  per  cent confidence , that the median @xmath31 values for lat - detected sources are statistically higher than those for the rest of the sample ( figure  [ f : tb ] ) .",
    "the same result is found if the maximum @xmath31 values are used in the analysis . based on earlier brightness temperature findings of @xcite ,",
    "these results suggest higher doppler factors for the lat - detected sources , although their recent work @xcite indicates that variations in the intrinsic @xmath31 among jets may also play an important role in the brightest objects .",
    "therefore , we expect that they might also have faster apparent jet speeds , which is indeed confirmed by results of the direct kinematics analysis presented by @xcite .",
    "lister et al .  have shown that lat - detected quasars in the complete mojave sample have preferentially faster jet motions than the non - detected ones .",
    "on the basis of the joint analysis of the _ fermi _",
    "@xmath0-ray lat and radio observations of parsec - scale jets in blazars we conclude the following . the @xmath0-ray and parsec - scale radio emissions are strongly related in bright @xmath0-ray objects detected by _",
    "fermi _  .",
    "at radio wavelengths , @xmath0-ray bright sources are found to be preferentially brighter and more compact , which suggests that they might have higher doppler factors than other blazars .",
    "the correlations found suggest that the prominent flares in both @xmath0-ray and radio bands are produced in the cores of parsec - scale jets , typically within an apparent time separation of up to a few months .",
    "these findings could be a consequence of relativistic beaming that boosts the jet emission in both bands .",
    "the first three months of _ fermi _",
    "observations represent a significant improvement over the earlier egret results , due to the dramatic increase in sensitivity and temporal coverage . the combination of these _ fermi _  lat measurements and the extensive vlba monitoring at 15  ghz by the mojave program has proved to be a powerful tool to study the nature of the emission processes in extragalactic jets .",
    "we found a clear connection between the beamed relativistic radio jets and the @xmath0-ray emission expected to originate in these regions , confirming and enhancing earlier results obtained by comparing radio data with the egret catalog .",
