    "chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) of graphene on metal surfaces@xcite is currently viewed as one of the most promising scalable methods for economically producing large and abundant high - quality monolayer graphene sheets .",
    "it is thus greatly important to fully understand and control the behavior of electrons on this form of graphene .",
    "cvd graphene , as any other solid grown by chemical vapor deposition , is generally a polycrystal composed by several grains with distinct crystallographic orientations .",
    "these grains are separated by grain boundaries ( gbs),@xcite which due to the @xmath0 bonding structure of carbon atoms in graphene , are typically made of pentagonal , heptagonal and octagonal rings of carbon atoms.@xcite grain boundaries generally intercept each other at random angles , being neither periodic nor perfect straight lines .    the properties of cvd graphene flakes are strongly influenced by the quantity , distribution and microscopic character of its grain boundaries.@xcite each type of grain boundary exhibits distinctive chemical,@xcite mechanical@xcite and electronic@xcite properties .",
    "this is particularly evident in what concerns the electronic transport in cvd graphene .",
    "for instance , there is abundant experimental evidence that the details of the cvd - growth recipes used to synthesize cvd graphene flakes greatly constrain its transport properties.@xcite furthermore , application of strain and chemical decoration are also expected to strongly influence cvd - graphene transport properties.@xcite in particular , as shown by several recent experiments probing the transport properties of single grain boundaries,@xcite the electron - scattering off a grain boundary is determined by the its microscopic details and the relative orientation of the grains it separates.@xcite    observation and probing of graphene grain boundaries has been constantly refined in recent years , as shown by a quick survey of the recent literature in the field.@xcite more interestingly , several promising new methods of controlling and manipulating the position , orientation and microscopic configuration of grain boundaries have been recently unveiled.@xcite some of these methods allow for the creation of periodic and straight grain boundaries,@xcite whose transport properties have been extensively investigated theoretically.@xcite this widens the prospects for the engineering of graphene - based electronic devices that take advantage of the scattering properties of these grain boundaries , to manipulate graphene electrons various degrees of freedom , such as its valley quantum number .",
    "following these recent advances , in this manuscript , we will focus our attention on the electronic properties of a particular class of periodic and linear grain boundaries that is often disregarded in the literature .",
    "namely , we will investigate grain boundaries with periodicities such that both dirac points ( on each side of the gb ) are mapped into the @xmath1 point of the projected brillouin zone  see ref .",
    "for a brief discussion of their properties . due to this mapping of the dirac points ,",
    "such grain boundaries allow for intervalley scattering of low - energy charge carriers . in what follows",
    "we will show how can we work out the low - energy electronic scattering off such gbs , and will see how the intervalley scattering depends on the system s microscopic details .    to keep things simple ,",
    "we have chosen to investigate zigzag aligned linear grain boundaries separating two grains with the same orientation ( also referred to in the literature as degenerate or zero misorientation - angle grain boundaries ) .",
    "several such gbs were proposed in the context of ab - initio works both on graphene and on boron nitride : the t7t5 grain boundary,@xcite the 7557 grain boundary@xcite and the 8484 grain boundary.@xcite",

    "as is well known , graphene s low energy charge carriers behave as massless dirac fermions .",
    "these are governed by a hamiltonian composed of two copies of the 2d dirac hamiltonian , each one of them valid around one of the two dirac points.@xcite in this limit the grain boundary essentially acts as a one - dimensional line that imposes a boundary condition on the dirac spinors living on the semi - planes above and bellow the grain boundary .",
    "such boundary condition will result in a discontinuity in the spinors across the defect and will control its scattering properties.@xcite in alternative , the grain boundary can also be thought of as a finite width strip containing a generalized potential that constrains the dynamics of the massless dirac fermions.@xcite    the specific form of the boundary condition seen by the massless dirac fermions at the 3-periodic pentagon - only grain boundary is determined by the details of its microscopic tight - binding model . in calculating it , we will follow the methodology developed for the cases of the pentagon - only , @xmath9 and @xmath10 grain boundaries.@xcite below , we show that the boundary condition obtained from the tight - binding gives rise , in the low - energy limit , to a boundary condition explicitly introducing intervalley scattering .",
