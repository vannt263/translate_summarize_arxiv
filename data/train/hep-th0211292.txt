    "consider the ads / cft duality map when the spacetime is @xmath3 .",
    "the dual theory is a 1 + 1 dimensional cft obtained from the low energy limit of the d1-d5 bound state @xcite .    more specifically ,",
    "consider ` global @xmath4 ' @xmath5 .",
    "the state of the cft dual to this geometry is the neveu - schwarz ( ns ) vaccum @xmath6 .",
    "this vacuum is the simplest state of the cft , with @xmath7 .",
    "the next simplest states are expected to be the chiral primaries of the cft , with @xmath8 .",
    "what are the metrics dual to these states of the cft ?    by the general nature of the ads / cft map we expect that the dual of a chiral primaries will be created by putting an appropriate massless particle from the supergravity multiplet into the geometry ; the particle rotates on @xmath9 with angular momentum @xmath10 and sits at the origin of @xmath4 ( so that we get ` minimum energy for given charge ' ) . in @xcite the wavefunction for such a quantum was computed ",
    "it was given by an appropriate spherical harmonic on @xmath9 and was localized around @xmath11 in @xmath4 .    in the cft , we can list chiral primaries most easily at the ` orbifold point ' . at this point in moduli space",
    "the cft is described by a @xmath12 supersymmetric sigma model with target space @xmath13 , the symmetric product of @xmath14 copies of @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "the state dual to the supergravity quantum mentioned above is given by a ` twist ' operator acting on the vacuum creates a cyclic permutation of @xmath16 copies of @xmath15 around its insertion point .",
    "the superscripts @xmath17 indicate that this chiral primary corresponds to the @xmath18 form on @xmath15 ; action of fermion zero modes can raise the indices upto @xmath19 which corresponds to the top form @xmath20 on @xmath15 .",
    "for a detailed study of these chiral primaries see @xcite . ]",
    "_ n^|0_ns the operator @xmath21 has @xmath22 .",
    "we are interested in studying the metrics dual to the chiral primaries .",
    "thus we want the backreaction of the supergravity quanta on the geometry .",
    "this backreaction will be described classically when we consider a large number of massless quanta orbiting the @xmath9 . in the cft",
    "we expect that the corresponding metric will be dual to a chiral primary _ n_1^_n_2^ ",
    "_n_k^|0_ns [ one ]    let us see what we expect to be the nature of the corresponding geometry . a priori",
    ", we are led to consider three possibilities :    \\(a ) _ conical defect metrics:_we can regard the supergravity theory as a 2 + 1 dimensional gravity theory arising from dimensional reduction on @xmath23 .",
    "a particle with angular momentum on @xmath9 appears as a particle with mass @xmath24 in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "but in 2 + 1 gravity massive particles create ` conical defect metrics ' so we may expect that the metrics dual to chiral primaries ( [ one ] ) will have such a conical defect structure in some way .",
    "\\(b ) _ aichelburg - sexl metric:_now consider the particles from the viewpoint of 5 + 1 dimensional @xmath0 spacetime .",
    "a chiral primary state has the least energy for given angular momentum .",
    "at least naively , this suggests that we must have all the massless particles rotating on a common diameter of the @xmath9 , at the origin in @xmath4 .",
    "if we go close to this diameter , we just see a uniform line of massless particles , moving at the speed of light along this line , in a spacetime that is essentially @xmath25 dimensional flat spacetime in the neighborhood of the line .",
    "the metric of a massless particle in flat space is the aichelburg - sexl metric , which is readily extended to a line of massless particles .",
    "we thus expect the metric to be this aichelburg - sexl type near the diameter , while going over to @xmath0 at infinity .",
    "but such a metric does _ not _ have a conical defect structure ; metrics in dimensions higher than 2 + 1 have power law behavior near the singularity .",
    "thus if such a solution were the correct one then it would certainly be different from ( a ) above .",
    "\\(c ) _ giant gravitons:_there is yet a third possibility for the metric that we need to consider .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that massless quanta rotating on the sphere with high angular momenta can expand to large radius objects while maintaining the condition @xmath26 .",
    "in other examples of @xmath27 spacetimes the radius of the ` giant graviton ' increases with its angular momentum @xmath28 , but for @xmath0 we have a slightly different situation .",
    "giant gravitons can exist only at certain points in the moduli space .",
    "such a special point is obtained for example in the case when @xmath29 when all the gauge fields are set to zero . at these special points a graviton can become ` giant ' whenever its angular momentum @xmath28 is a multiple of @xmath30 . at such @xmath28 the potential for the radial size of the graviton",
    "is ` flat ' so the graviton can have any diameter while maintaining @xmath26 .",
    "geometries with a classical value for total angular momentum will have @xmath31 , so we can obtain the desired angular momentum by using a large number of giant gravitons .",
    "but since these objects are extended , we expect to get a metric that differs from both the metrics suggested in ( a ) and ( b ) above .",
    "we can thus restate our basic question as : which of these three kinds of metrics correspond to chiral primaries of the cft ?",
    "it is possible to construct explicitly metrics of _ each _ of the above three types .",
    "each metric is a classical solution of the full supergravity equations , and has energy and angular momentum which translate to @xmath26 .",
    "this sharpens the above question  what is the correct dual of the chiral primaries of the cft ?      in short , what we find is the following .",
    "we can construct metrics dual to _ all _ chiral primaries of the cft using the solutions for the r sector found in @xcite .",
    "from this set we see that the ` conical defect metrics ' ( case ( a ) ) are a special case where all the @xmath32 in ( [ one ] ) are _",
    "equal_. we then find that the aichelburg - sexl type metrics ( case ( b ) ) arise from chiral primaries where a fraction of the @xmath32 in ( [ one ] ) are unity ( @xmath33 is just the identity operator ) while the rest are large numbers but not necessarily equal .",
    "both the above metrics describe chiral primaries of the d1-d5 bound state ; the two cases give in some sense two opposite limits of the general metrics dual to chiral primaries .",
    "by contrast , the giant graviton metrics turn out to describe d1-d5 systems that are ` disassociated '  some fraction of the d1 and d5 branes are pulled out from the bound state to a finite distance away from the other branes .    in more detail ,",
    "our methods and results are as follows :    ( a)we first recall the construction of @xcite that gives the metrics for general r sector ground states .",
    "we also recall the notion of @xcite that spectral flow to the ns sector is accomplished by a ` large change ' of coordinates which returns us to the same metric but with a different periodicity for the fermions .",
    "thus we obtain the metrics for general chiral primary states ; for special families of states this construction was considered in @xcite .",
    "( b)we then consider two special families of metrics : the conical defect metrics considered in @xcite and the aichelburg - sexl type metric constructed in @xcite .",
    "the chiral primary state corresponding to the conical defect metrics was constructed in @xcite , and was given by the action of twist operators on the ns vacuum with all twist operators having the same order and spin .",
    "the cft description for the aichelburg - sexl metric was not known , and we find this description here ; we map the d1-d5 state by s , t dualities to a fundamental string carrying vibrations and then , following the general analysis of @xcite , read off the orders and spins of the twist operators in the cft state from the fourier transform of the vibration profile .",
    "( c)we note that we can separate a d1 brane from the d1-d5 bound state at special values of the moduli , and displace it away from the rest of the bound state in a transverse direction .",
    "this is a static configuration , but after the coordinate change to the ns sector the separated d1 brane is seen to spin around the @xmath9 giving a giant graviton .",
    "we get a unified picture for giant gravitons on the @xmath4 and on the @xmath9 , as both arise as special limits of a giant graviton that winds on both the @xmath4 and the @xmath9 .    using this picture for giant gravitons",
    "we can construct the metric for any distribution of giant gravitons , since the classical metric produced by a set of disjoint d1-d5 systems can be written down by just superposing the harmonic functions appearing in the metric .",
    "as an example we take a particular distribution of giant gravitons and compute the metric it produces .    given this construction of giant gravitons , we suggest that giant graviton excitations do not describe chiral primary states of the d1-d5 system , since such chiral primaries should be given by configurations of the d1-d5 _ bound _ state ; the metrics for all such bound states can be obtained as in ( a ) above .",
    "( d)we return to the metrics for generic chiral primary states and analyze the large @xmath34 behavior of the first few corrections to the background @xmath0 .",
    "we note that the conical defect metrics are locally exactly @xmath0 , so all excitations save some global pure gauge fields are zero at infinity . for the aichelburg - sexl type metric",
    "we find nontrivial corrections at infinity , including the excitation of some low mass scalars and gauge fields which we study explicitly .",
    "we conjecture that the existence of these fields is related to the fact that the twist operators creating the dual cft state have a wide dispersion in their orders in the aichelburg - sexl case , while they have no dispersion in the conical defect metrics .",
    "following up on this conjecture we look at the asymptotic fields for generic chiral primary states , and find that we can relate the existence of these corrections to the presence of dispersions in the orders and spins of the twist operators creating the dual cft state .",
    "let us recall some results from @xcite . we take @xmath29 for concreteness .",
    "consider type iib string theory compactified on @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 has volume @xmath37 and is parametrized by coordinates @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath39 has radius @xmath40 and is parametrized by a coordinate @xmath41 .",
    "the noncompact directions are @xmath42 .",
    "we wrap @xmath30 d5 branes on @xmath35 and @xmath43 d1 branes on @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in the cft arising from the low energy physics of the _ bound state _ of these branes .",
    "the field theory describing this bound state has its fermions periodic around the @xmath39 and is thus in the ramond ( r ) sector .",
    "the r ground state of the cft is highly degenerate , with a degeneracy @xmath44 .",
    "one might naively think that such bound states are pointlike in the transverse space @xmath45 , and that the corresponding metrics have a pointlike singularity at the origin @xmath11 in this space . to see that such is not the case and to construct the actual metrics for the d1-d5 ground states , it is helpful to map the d1-d5 system by a set of @xmath46 dualities to the fp system : we obtain a fundamental string ( f ) wrapped @xmath30 times around @xmath39 , carrying momentum ( p ) along the @xmath39 .",
    "the fact that we are studying a _ bound _ state of these charges implies that the f string is a single ` multiwound ' string , and all the momentum p is carried by traveling waves on this string .",
    "it is possible to write down the supergravity solution for a string carrying traveling waves in one direction .",
    "the only subtlety is that we have many strands of the ` multiwound ' string , and must superpose harmonic functions arising from different strands .",
    "turns around the @xmath39 .",
    "but as long as the momentum flows along the same direction on each strand we can superpose harmonic functions , and the final configuration is a 1/4 bps solution of iib supergravity . ]",
    "such a superposition was carried out in @xcite for the case where the string profile was a uniform helix ; dualizing back to the d1-d5 system we obtained the subclass of metrics studied in @xcite .",
    "more generally , let the f string have a vibration profile in the noncompact spatial directions directions , though in principle these could be handled the same way .",
    "the restriction on vibrations corresponds , after mapping to the d1-d5 system , to using cohomology elements @xmath47 from @xmath48 .",
    "both @xmath48 and @xmath49 have the one form of each of these types ; the remaining vibrations would differentiate between these two spaces .",

    "the supergravity solution created by such a string is given in eqn .",
    "( [ chiralnull ] ) in appendix a. if we perform the chain of dualities that take us to the d1-d5 system then we get the supergravity solution [ d1d5chiral ] ds^2&=&+ dxdx + & + & dzdz + e^2&=&h(1+k),c^(2)_ti=,c^(2)_ty=- , + c^(2)_iy&=&-,c^(2)_ij = c_ij+ the functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 appearing in this solution are related to the profile @xmath56 : [ cnmprof ] h^-1=1+_0^l , k=_0^l , a_i=-_0^l and the forms @xmath57 and @xmath58 are defined by the duality relations : [ dualfields ] db=-^*da , dc=-^*dh^-1 .",

    "different profiles of the vibrating f string correspond to different r ground states of the d1-d5 system .",
    "( this relation was studied in detail in @xcite and will be reviewed below . )",
    "it is important that the f string has no longitudinal vibration mode , and must therefore necessarily bend away from the central axis in order to carry the momentum p. the corresponding metrics thus have an extended singularity rather than a pointlike singularity at @xmath11 .",
    "as mentioned above , the above metrics describe states of the r sector , since the fermions are periodic under @xmath62 .",
    "we wish to obtain metrics for the ns sector , where we have chiral primaries ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) .",
    "the operation of spectral flow maps r sector ground states in the cft to chiral primaries in the ns sector of the cft , in a 1 - 1 and onto fashion .",
    "for the special class of d1-d5 metrics studied in @xcite the description of spectral flow in the supergravity dual was discussed , and we can extend that to the general set of metrics ( [ d1d5chiral ] ) as follows .",
    "we first take the limit r(q_1q_5)^1/4a ,  |x|(q_1q_5)^1/4 , [ five ] where @xmath65 is the size of the singularity ( @xmath66 ) .",

    "but we may make the same coordinate change at infinity also for the more general class ( [ d1d5chiral ] ) , and thus obtain metrics dual to all chiral primary states of the ns sector .",
    "we recall in more detail the map @xcite between 1/4 bps states of the fp system and chiral primaries of the d1-d5 system .",
    "the traveling waves travel in only one direction along the f string , for states with supersymmetry .",

    "the reason for this is the following .",
    "the s , t dualities relate the f string carrying the vibrations @xmath91 to the d1-d5 system in the r sector .",
    "if we spectral flow the chiral primaries @xmath92 from the ns to the r sector then we find that they have @xmath88 spins j_3=2 ,  |j_3=2 and they form the @xmath93 representation of @xmath88 .",
    "the spins of the vibrations on the f string and the spins in the r sector of the d1-d5 system are immediately identified with each other , since the s , t dualities do not affect the transverse coordinates @xmath45 which give the @xmath85 .",
    "we can get a classical vibration profile for the string if we excite a large number of vibration quanta .",
    "such a state maps to a state of the form ( [ one ] ) in the ns sector of the d1-d5 system .",
    "the solutions ( [ d1d5chiral ] ) possess a singularity at the location of the f string in the fp system , which maps to a corresponding singularity in the d1-d5 system .",
    "it is important to note that this singularity is an acceptable one that will be resolved in the full string theory . in the fp system",
    "we have started with a fundamental string in flat space , and this string is a valid quantum in the full string theory . thus the metric it creates is a true solution of the full theory .",
    "the dualities we have used to go to the d1-d5 system are also true dualities since they are made along closed cycles of the @xmath48 ; thus they are not just ` solution generating techniques ' for classical supergravity solutions , which would be the case for example if we dualized along some other direction of the spacetime . in performing this duality",
    "we have ` smoothed over ' the singular locus of the f string since this string had a large number of strands ( this is explained in detail in @xcite ) ; this smoothing should generate the correct classical d1-d5 solution for the r sector .",
    "the truncation to the @xmath94 region was done by a limiting process @xmath95 and looking only at @xmath96 ; this is therefore also an allowed step in the full quantum string theory .",
    "lastly , map to the ns sector was just a change of coordinates ( [ rtons ] ) , and so does not spoil the existence of the solution .",
    "thus the metrics we make for the chiral primaries are the classical limits of exact string theory solutions , and not just classical solutions with singularity .",
    "let the f string carry a traveling wave which has all its energy only in the lowest harmonic .",
    "further , let the polarization of this wave be such that the string rotates in a helical fashion in the @xmath97 plane ( recall that @xmath45 are the four transverse direction in which we are considering vibrations ) .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that this configuration of the fp system possesses the maximal possible angular momentum for given f and p charges : under the @xmath88 this configuration has @xmath98 .",
    "the metric of this configuration was computed , and was shown to map under dualities to the ` maximally rotating ' d1-d5 bound state discussed in @xcite .    in more detail , consider a fp metric generated by a following profile : g_1=av,g_2=av , g_3=g_4=0 [ yyoneprime ] we choose = which corresponds to the f string having all its energy in the lowest harmonic ( recall that the f string has winding number @xmath30 around the @xmath41 circle , and we use @xmath81 to denote the radius of @xmath41 direction on the fp side ) .",
    "we wish to write the metric for the corresponding d1-d5 system . in terms of the parameters of the d1d5 system",
    "the profile ( [ yyoneprime ] ) becomes : f_1=av , f_2=av , f_3=f_4=0,= [ yyone ] for later use it is convenient to introduce l=2r n_5= the d1-d5 metric is given by eqn .",
    "( [ d1d5chiral ] ) , with coefficient functions @xmath99 given by ( [ cnmprof ] ) .",
    "as an example of the computation note that in @xmath67 we get the harmonic function created by a uniform circular source : h^-1&=&1+q2_0 ^ 2 d(x_1-a)^2+(x_2-a)^2+x_3 ^ 2+x_4 ^ 2 + & = & 1+q where in the last step we have used the polar coordinates ( [ etwo ] ) .",
    "the above expression simplifies if we change from @xmath100 to coordinates @xmath101 : & = & ,   = r [ ethree ] ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 remain unchanged )",
    ". then we get h^-1=1+qr^2+a^2 ^ 2    we can go to the near horizon limit ( @xmath96 ) , and then the metric of the d1d5 system becomes ( we write @xmath104 ) : ds^2&=&-(r^2 + 1)+r^2 + + & + & the charge @xmath105 is related by dualities to the momentum charge p carried by the f string , and for the profile ( [ yyone ] ) we find q_1=a^2 ^ 2q_5 , which for the profile we are considering translates into = .",
    "lastly , performing the coordinate change ( [ efour ] ) that gives spectral flow we get the metric [ esix ] ds^2&= & + & + & , which is just @xmath70 .    on the cft side , the fact that all the energy of the fp system is in the lowest harmonic implies under the map ( [ themap ] ) that all the twist operators have order unity .",
    "the choice of rotation plane ( @xmath97 ) implies that we get the operator @xmath33 for each quantum of vibration .",
    "but this is just the identity operator , with @xmath7 .",
    "thus the cft state dual to the metric under consideration is ( in the ns sector ) just @xmath83 .    in figure 1(a ) we have sketched the f string , opened up to its full length @xmath80 and carrying the vibration profile mentioned above .",
    "the dual state @xmath83 is of course the simplest chiral primary .",
    "we will use similar figures to discuss more complicated cases below .",
    "take the f string to again rotate in the @xmath97 plane but let all the energy be in the @xmath106th harmonic ( instead of the first harmonic ) .",
    "figure 1(b ) shows the f string carrying such a vibration with @xmath107 .",
    "the metric for this configuration yields @xcite , after dualization to the d1-d5 system , the general metrics discussed in @xcite . after the limit ( [ five ] ) is taken , we get a metric that is locally @xmath108 .",
    "but there is a singular circle , such that at any point along this circle we have a ` conical defect ' : a wedge is removed from the @xmath4 and the @xmath9 is glued across the cut after a suitable rotation .",
    "taking the limit ( [ five ] ) , and making the coordinate changes ( [ etwo ] ) , ( [ ethree ] ) , ( [ efour ] ) just as in case i above we get the metrics for the chiral primary @xcite : [ two ] ds^2&= & + & + & , where @xmath109 .    in the cft",
    "we find that the dual state is ( using the map ( [ themap ] ) ) [ chirprcon ] [ _ m^]^n / m|0_ns , where @xmath14 .",
    "the number @xmath110 of twist operators comes from the fact that all the @xmath111 copies of @xmath48 in the symmetric product must be involved in the permutation ( a copy not involved in the permutation gives a permutation cycle of length unity , which gives the twist @xmath112 and implies a vibration quantum in the _ first _ harmonic on the f string ) .",
    "consider the d1-d5 geometry @xmath70 ; this is the dual of the ns vacuum @xmath83 . as discussed in section 1",

    "we are interested in the metric obtained after we take the backreaction of the rotating quanta into account . to reach the classical limit we take several such massless quanta rotating along the @xmath116 circle at @xmath117 .",
    "these quanta can have different values for @xmath118 , but the overall distribution is selected to satisfy the following conditions :    ( i)we take a large number of quanta so that we can approximate the energy distribution by a continuous one along the circle @xmath117 .",

    "let us summarize our main conclusions . in most treatments of @xmath255 duality",
    "we start with the geometry @xmath148 which is dual to the vacuum of the cft .",
    "we then consider excitations over this vacuum perturbatively , for example in the computation of multipoint correlation functions of chiral primaries @xcite .",
    "for the case @xmath0 however we are able to write down exact supergravity solutions that describe arbitrary chiral primary states .",
    "these geometries are _ not _ small perturbations to @xmath0 , though they go to @xmath0 at large @xmath34 .",
    "the availability of these solutions allows us to probe questions that we can not address at present using other @xmath148 spaces .    at first",
    "it appears to be clear what a chiral primary is : we have one or more massless quanta of supergravity rotating around a diameter of @xmath9 . but",
    "a further look indicates that the problem is more complex : we can find more than one family of metrics that have @xmath26 .",
    "further , the work on giant gravitons suggests that the rotating quanta may themselves be finite size objects rather than pointlike particles , and this would create more complicated metrics after the backreaction is taken into account .",
    "we found that two special families of metrics with @xmath26  the conical defect metrics and the aichelburg - sexl type solution  were special cases of the general set of chiral primaries that can be written down using the map to the fp system developed in @xcite .",
    "but the cft states dual to these two families were characterized by rather different distributions of twist operators  in the first case all twist operators were identical while in the second case there was a wide dispersion in their orders @xmath32 .",
    "the giant graviton solutions turned out to not describe states of the bound d1-d5 system at all  the bound states map under s , t dualities to a single f string carrying vibrations , while the giant gravitons correspond to breaking this string into two or more pieces .",
    "it is noteworthy that a giant graviton type solution can be written down not only for the space @xmath0 but also for all the geometries ( [ d1d5chiral ] ) which go over at infinity to flat space .",
    "this is easy to see : in the r sector we have to break off some of the d1 and d5 branes and separate them from the rest of the d1-d5 bound state by a transverse displacement .",
    "this solution always exists classically since for vanishing moduli there is no force between the d1-d5 bound state and transversely displaced d1 or d5 branes . the coordinate change ( [ rtons ] ) to the ns sector then makes this static d1 brane rotate , and we get a d1 brane that maintains its finite size while satisfying its classical equation of motion .",
    "it is important to note that such a giant graviton , while appearing to be a supersymmetric solution at classical order , is not a supersymmetric solution in the exact theory . to see this",
    "consider for simplicity two parallel d - p branes , each wrapped on a finite torus @xmath256 of volume @xmath201 and placed a distance @xmath65 apart .",
    "classically this configuration has a mass @xmath257 where @xmath258 is the string coupling , and a charge that is related to the mass by a bps condition .",
    "but in order for the two branes to be localized at their respective positions we must make a superposition of their momentum eigenfunctions , and this adds in a ` localization energy ' of order @xmath259 . thus to get mass equaling charge",
    "we must either place the two branes in their zero momentum eigenfunctions  in which case their mean separation becomes infinity and we do not get a set of branes at finite separation @xmath65  or we take their ( unique ) bound state , where the wavefunction describing their relative separation is a very particular wavefunction and the exact solution is known to be bps .",
    "the above discussion extends to the geometry that we can create by putting @xmath111 branes at each of the locations @xmath260 .",
    "classically this geometry will appear supersymmetric , but for any finite @xmath111 it is clear that corrections of order @xmath258 will have to show us a breakdown of supersymmetry .",
    "( in a worldsheet description this breakdown should occur due to one loop open string diagrams . )",
    "similarly we can conclude that the giant graviton solutions do not represent exactly supersymmetric states and are thus not chiral primaries . since the potential is flat",
    "; such a delocalization does not happen for the bound states which are described by a single f string carrying momentum p. ] we note that the case of @xmath0 is rather special however , and this conclusion may not carry over to giant gravitons in other @xmath148 spaces .",
    "returning to the d1-d5 bound state solutions , we recall that the prescription of @xcite allowed us to compute expectation values of operators in the ns vacuum of a cft by using the dual supergravity .",
    "it appears plausible that given the solutions representing chiral primary states , there would be a way to compute expectation values of operators in such states , by a perturbative supergravity computation around these more complicated backgrounds . even without setting up such a computational scheme , it appears reasonable that the behavior of the supergravity solutions near infinity contains information about the corresponding cft state : for any supergravity mode the solution growing at @xmath187 describes operators inserted at the boundary while the solution decaying at infinity describes the ` state ' of the cft @xcite .    in view of these expectations",
    "we have examined the @xmath187 behavior of the general supergravity solution describing a chiral primary .",
    "we noted that the conical defect solutions were locally @xmath70 , so there were no excitations at infinity apart from a pure gauge term mixing the @xmath9 with the @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding cft state was created by a set of twist operators that were all identical .",
    "the aichelburg - sexl type solution did have nontrivial excitations of field at infinity , and there was a dispersion in the orders of the twist operators .",
    "we found that this was somewhat of a general pattern  we could relate the strength of several fields at infinity to some _ dispersion _ in the twist operators creating the state .",
    "it would be interesting to see if such a principle holds more generally in the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "we would like to thank sumit das , juan maldacena and inyong park for helpful discussions . the work of sdm and as was supported in part by doe grant de - fg02 - 91er-40690 .",
    "ol was supported by nsf grant phy0070928 .",
    "in this appendix we will recall the construction of @xcite which related solutions for the vibrating string with solutions describing the d1d5 system .",
    "we begin with a fundamental string which carries momentum .",
    "the general solution for such a string is given by a chiral null model @xcite : [ chiralnull ] ds^2&=&h(x,v)(-du  dv+k(x,v)dv^2 + 2a_i(x,v)dx_i dv)+ dxdx+dzdz , + b_uv&=&-g_uv = h(x,v),b_vi =- g_vi =- h(x,v)a_i(x,v ) , + & & e^-2=h^-1(x,v).[chiralsolution ] regarding @xmath261 as a gauge field we can construct the field strength @xmath262 .",
    "the functions in the chiral null model are required satisfy the equations [ nulleqn ] ^2 h^-1=0,^2 k=0,_if^ij=0 . here",
    "@xmath263 is the laplacian in the @xmath264 coordinates .",
    "note that the indices @xmath265 span the subspace @xmath266 where the metric is just @xmath216 , and thus these indices are raised and lowered by this flat metric .",
    "note that before performing the s duality relating ( p , d5 ) and ( p , ns5 ) we also perform an electric ",
    "magnetic duality ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the resulting d1d5 geometry is : [ ad1d5chiral ] ds^2&=&+ dxdx + & + & dzdz + e^2&=&h(1+k),c^(2)_ti=,c^(2)_ty=- , + c^(2)_iy&=&-,c^(2)_ij = c_ij+ the functions @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 appearing in this solution have the same values as @xmath267 , @xmath268 and @xmath261 : h(x)=h(x ) , k(x)=k(x),a_i(x)=a_i(x ) , and the forms @xmath57 and @xmath58 are defined by [ adualfields ] dc=-^*dh^-1,db=-^*da . here",
    "hodge dual is taken with respect to the four dimensional space @xmath269 with flat metric .",
    "note that due to the equations of motion for the null chiral model ( [ nulleqn ] ) : d^*dh^-1=0 , d^*da=0 the equations ( [ dualfields ] ) can be integrated to give the forms @xmath270 and @xmath60 .",
    "if we consider the metric created by a single elementary string , then the parameters of the chiral null model are not arbitrary , but they are determined in terms of the vibration profile @xmath271 : h^-1=1+_0^l , k=_0^l , a_i=-_0^l [ qqqqone ] as an example we consider the helical profile : f_1=a , f_2=a , f_3=f_4=0 . for this profile",
    "it is convenient to make a change of coordinates ( [ etwo ] ) , ( [ ethree ] ) .",
    "then in terms of the new coordinates @xmath272 we find the geometry of the d1d5 system @xcite : [ d1d5ap ] ds^2&=&-(dt^2-d y^2)+ ( + d^2)+ _",

    "here we have introduced three convenient functions : [ f0def ] f_0=r^2 + a^2 ^ 2,f_1=f_0+q_1,f_5=f_0+q_5 . and the charges are q_5=q , q_1=q()^2 in the near horizon limit ( @xmath273 ) the metric reduces to ( [ two ] ) with @xmath274 .",
