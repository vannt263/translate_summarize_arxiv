    "in the last few years , approximately 40 new galactic sources of very - high - energy ( vhe ) @xmath2-ray emission ( 100gev@xmath3100tev ) have been discovered using the high energy stereoscopic system ( hess ) cherenkov telescope array ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these are an exciting new population of sources , which give new insight into non - thermal particle acceleration in galactic objects such as neutron stars , supernova remnants , and x - ray binaries . thus far ,",
    "close to half of these sources have been established or suggested as being associated with the pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) of young pulsars , either through direct detection of a pwn or positional coincidence with a young pulsar which is presumed to have a pwn ( table  [ tab : assoc ] ) .",
    "clearly , pwne are now an important and well - established galactic source of vhe @xmath2-rays . since both young pulsars and their pwne can be very dim , many of the galactic hess sources without identified counterparts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may be pwne , potentially detectable via deep radio or x - ray observations .    in general ,",
    "radio / x - ray pwne are associated with extended hess sources , presumably tev pwne , whose peak is offset by several arcminutes from the pulsar ( table  [ tab : assoc ] ) . in some cases",
    "the offset , if any , can not be measured because the position of the pulsar is not known ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "these offsets have been explained by the hypothesis that the vhe emission is from inverse compton scattering of `` old '' electrons , which were produced during an earlier epoch in the pulsar s life , off of the ambient photon field ( e.g. , cosmic microwave background radiation , starlight , and infrared emission from dust ; see aharonian et al .",
    "2005d , de jager & djannati - ata 2008 ) .",
    "an alternative model has the @xmath2-rays produced by the decay of @xmath6 mesons , which are created by the interaction of accelerated hadrons with nuclei in the interstellar medium @xcite . in both cases , asymmetric crushing of the pulsar wind by the reverse shock of the expanding supernova remnant , in cases where",
    "the remnant has expanded into an asymmetric density distribution in the ambient medium , is then responsible for the offset between the pulsar and the peak of the vhe emission @xcite .",
    "a high pulsar proper motion may also play a role in the offset .",
    "the vhe emission could be a key into the earlier energetic history of these young pulsars as well as completing a broadband ( radio to tev @xmath2-rays ) picture of the shocked pulsar wind , whose emission would be dominated by synchrotron - emitting electrons below @xmath7gev and inverse compton emission from the scattering of these same particles above this energy .    in this letter ,",
    "we present the discovery and subsequent timing of the `` vela - like '' pulsar ( i.e. pulsars having characteristic age @xmath8kyr and spin - down luminosity @xmath9ergs s@xmath1 ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) psr j1856 + 0245  in the arecibo palfa survey of the galactic plane .",
    "this young , energetic pulsar is positionally coincident with , and energetically capable of creating , the vhe emission observed from the hitherto unidentified tev source hess j1857 + 026  @xcite .",
    "this association suggests that some of the other currently unidentified , extended hess sources in the galactic plane may also be related to faint radio pulsars , rather than some new source class .",
    "an archival _ asca _  image of the area around psr j1856 + 0245and hess j1857 + 026  shows a possible x - ray counterpart , cataloged as ax j185651 + 0245  by @xcite , at the pulsar position ; this is possibly a synchrotron counterpart to the tev pwn @xmath2-ray data , @xcite identified the source egr j1856 + 0235 , which is analogous to 3eg j1856 + 0114 in the 3rd @xmath10 catalog .",
    "psr j1856 + 0245  is well within the 95% confidence region of egr j1856 + 0235 , suggesting the pulsar and/or its pwn are also visible in the mev - gev range .",
    "we will investigate this further in a follow - up paper . ] .",
    "psr j1856 + 0245  was discovered in the arecibo palfa survey for pulsars and radio transients ( cordes et al .",
    "2006 ; see also hessels 2007 ) .",
    "palfa is using the 1.4-ghz arecibo l - band feed array ( alfa ) 7-beam receiver to survey the galactic plane at longitudes of @xmath11 and @xmath12 , out to latitudes @xmath13 .",
    "the relatively high observing frequency and unequaled raw sensitivity of the arecibo telescope make the palfa survey sensitive to distant , faint , and scattered pulsars that were missed in previous surveys .",
    "the larger goals , design , and observational setup of the palfa survey are presented in detail by @xcite .",
    "we found psr j1856 + 0245  in a 268-s survey observation made on 2006 april 16 .",
    "the pulsar was identified at a signal - to - noise ratio of 35 within a few minutes of the discovery observation itself through a `` real time '' processing pipeline , operating on data with reduced time and spectral resolution , which is automatically run on the survey data as it is being collected @xcite .",
    "psr j1856 + 0245  has a spin period of 81ms and a large dispersion measure ( dm ) , 622@xmath14 pc .",
    "we estimate that the flux density at 1400mhz is @xmath15mjy .",
    "we also note that psr j1856 + 0245  shows a significant scattering tail at 1170mhz ( @xmath16ms at this frequency , where @xmath17 is the time constant of a one - sided exponential fitted to the pulse profile ) and would be difficult to detect below @xmath18mhz because the scattering time scale would be greater than the pulse period .    immediately following the discovery of psr j1856 + 0245",
    ", we began regular timing observations with arecibo and the jodrell bank observatory s 76-m lovell telescope in order to derive a precise rotational and astrometric ephemeris .",
    "between the two telescopes , timing observations were made on 148 separate days between 2006 april 24 and 2008 april 18 . at arecibo",
    ", observations were made using both the center pixel of the alfa receiver at 1440mhz ( identical setup to the standard palfa survey mode ) and the l - wide receiver with multiple wide - band arecibo pulsar processor ( wapp ) correlators centered at 1170 , 1370 , 1470 , and 1570mhz , each with 256 lags over 100mhz of bandwidth , sampled every 256@xmath19s .",
    "the typical integration time was 3 minutes .",
    "the jodrell bank observations were made at 1402/1418mhz with a @xmath20mhz incoherent filterbank system and 202@xmath19s sampling time .",
    "the typical integration time was 20 minutes .",
    "the resulting phase - connected timing solution for psr j1856 + 0245  is presented in table  [ tab : pulsar ] and combines data from both arecibo and jodrell bank .",
    "this solution shows that psr j1856 + 0245  is a vela - like pulsar with a characteristic age of 21kyr and a spin - down luminosity of @xmath21ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the solution was obtained using the tempo pulsar timing package .",
    "the times of arrival ( toas ) can be phase - connected by fitting only for position , dm , spin period @xmath22 , period derivative @xmath23 , and period second derivative @xmath24 , though further higher - order period derivatives are required to remove all trends in the toas ( i.e. , to `` whiten '' the residuals ) .",
    "these higher - order period derivatives , including @xmath24 , are non - determinisitc and are likely the result of timing noise , which is common in young pulsars .",
    "timing noise affects the measured position of psr j1856 + 0245  at a level exceeding the formal tempo uncertainties by an order of magnitude . separately fitting the toas from the first and second years of timing gives positions which differ by @xmath25 .",
    "we take this as a rough measure of the true uncertainty on the timing - derived position of psr j1856 + 0245 .    the identification of psr j1856 + 0245  as a young",
    ", energetic pulsar raises the likelihood that it powers a radio and/or x - ray pwn ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "accordingly , we have checked source catalogs and archival , multi - wavelength data for other sources at the radio timing position of the pulsar . these searches revealed that psr j1856 + 0245  is spatially coincident with the vhe @xmath2-ray source hess j1857 + 026  and the faint x - ray source ax j185651 + 0245 .",
    "we discuss these possible associations in  3 .",
    "psr j1856 + 0245  is spatially coincident with the unidentified vhe @xmath2-ray source hess j1857 + 026  discovered by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] ) . here",
    "we show that psr j1856 + 0245  is energetically capable of powering hess j1857 + 026  and that this association has similar characteristics to the other pulsar / vhe associations in the literature ( table  [ tab : assoc ] ) .",
    "the estimated distance to psr j1856 + 0245 , based on its dm and the ne2001 electron density model of the galaxy @xcite , is @xmath26kpc .",
    "the uncertainty on this distance is not well - defined , but in some cases the model can be off by as much as a factor of @xmath27 . adopting the dm - distance of 9kpc",
    "gives a large spin - down flux of @xmath28ergs s@xmath1 kpc@xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the true distance scaled to 9kpc .",
    "@xcite find that statistically 70% of pulsars with @xmath31ergs s@xmath1 kpc@xmath29 are visible as vhe @xmath2-ray sources .",
    "psr j1856 + 0245  is very close to this limit and may exceed it if its distance is overestimated .",
    "hence , based on its energetics alone , it is likely to be visible as a vhe @xmath2-ray source .",
    "hess j1857 + 026  has a photon index @xmath32 and @xmath5tev flux @xmath33ergs cm@xmath29 s@xmath1 ( about 15% of the crab s flux in this energy range ) ; these spectral parameters are similar to those measured for the other hess sources identified with pwne .",
    "given the spin - down luminosity of psr j1856 + 0245 , this suggests an efficiency @xmath35% ( @xmath5tev ) , comparable to what is seen in other proposed associations ( table  [ tab : assoc ] ) .",
    "psr j1856 + 0245  is offset from the centroid of hess j1857 + 026 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( j2000 , there is a @xmath38 statistical uncertainty on this position ) , by @xmath39 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] ) .",
    "as discussed in  1 , this is most likely explained by asymmetric confinement of the pulsar wind .",
    "this interpretation is supported by psr j1856 + 0245 s offset location on the side of hess j1857 + 026  that appears somewhat compressed ( i.e. , there is a steep gradient in the @xmath2-rays ) compared with the rest of the nebula .",
    "if , however , the offset of the vhe emission is due primarily to the proper motion of psr j1856 + 0245 , then the direction and rough magnitude of this motion are predictable . based on its characteristic age and",
    "offset from the centroid of hess j1857 + 026 , psr j1856 + 0245 s proper motion should be roughly 23mas yr@xmath1 ( transverse velocity @xmath40 km s@xmath1 ) , to the north - west , assuming that the centroid of hess j1857 + 026  marks the birthplace of the pulsar .",
    "the velocity is very large , but not unprecedented for a pulsar @xcite . of course",
    ", the velocity will be smaller if the distance to the source is overestimated , or if the offset is at least partially due to an asymmetrically confined pulsar wind .",
    "detecting this proper motion via timing or interferometry would elucidate this further and may be possible in the coming years , though timing noise and the low flux of the pulsar will make this difficult .",
    "psr j1856 + 0245  and hess j1857 + 026  are also coincident with the faint _ asca_x - ray source ax j185651 + 0245  reported by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see fig .",
    "[ fig : xray ] ) .",
    "ax j185651 + 0245  was found @xmath38 off axis in observations from 1998 april 6 ( sequence number 56003000 ) .",
    "it was detected only in the hard band ( @xmath41kev ) of the gas imaging spectrometers ( giss ) , with a count rate of 2.6ks@xmath1 gis@xmath1 and a significance of 4.3@xmath42 .",
    "the exposure was @xmath43ks for each of gis2 and gis3 .",
    "psr j1856 + 0245  and ax j185651 + 0245  ( j2000 position : @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) are spatially coincident to within the @xmath46 positional uncertainty of sources in the @xcite catalog .",
    "although the signal - to - noise ratio of the detection of ax j185651 + 0245  is modest , its exact spatial coincidence with a young pulsar of relatively high spin - down flux argues that this source is real .",
    "most of the previously established associations of hess sources with young pulsars also have known x - ray synchrotron pwne .",
    "+ 0245could be an x - ray pwn created by psr j1856 + 0245 . using cxcpimms , with an",
    "assumed absorbed power law spectrum with column density @xmath47cm@xmath29 ( roughly the total galactic contribution in this direction ) and photon index @xmath48 ( typical for x - ray pwne ) , we find that ax j185651 + 0245  has an unabsorbed flux ( @xmath41kev ) of @xmath49ergs s@xmath1 cm@xmath29 .",
    "this corresponds to an efficiency for the conversion of spin - down energy into x - rays @xmath50% ( @xmath41kev ) that falls into the observed range for vela - like pulsars @xcite .",
    "there are two additional nearby sources detected by @xcite : ax j185721 + 0247 and axj185750 + 0240 .",
    "it is possible that these are part of some extended x - ray emission related with hess j1857 + 026 , though deeper x - ray observations are needed to investigate this ( see below ) .",
    "there are four short _ swift",
    "_  observations of the region containing psr j1856 + 0245 , including two observations specifically targeting ax j185651 + 0245 .",
    "the deepest of these , from 2007 march 13 ( observation i d 36183002 ) , is a 4.1-ks on - axis exposure with the _ swift _  x - ray telescope ( xrt ) .",
    "this observation does not show any significant emission at the pulsar position ; within a circular extraction region of radius @xmath46 around the pulsar , the background subtracted number of counts is @xmath51 . using the aforementioned count rate of ax j185651 + 0245 , along with the same assumed spectrum , the predicted @xmath52kev count rate for xrt from cxcpimms is @xmath53counts / ks .",
    "thus , in 4.1ks , there should have been @xmath54counts , consistent with the 2-@xmath42 upper limit derived from the data .",
    "thus , if ax j185651 + 0245  is predominantly a point source , it was only at the limit of detectability in this observation .",
    "if it is predominantly an extended nebula , then it would not have been detectable in such a short exposure .",
    "clearly , future , deeper observations , like those that recently discovered a likely x - ray pwn associated with hess j1718@xmath3385/psr j1718@xmath33825 @xcite , will be needed to determine the nature of this candidate x - ray pwn .",
