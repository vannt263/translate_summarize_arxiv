    "within the past years , an immense effort has been put into revealing the nature and properties of deconfined strongly interacting matter both theoretically and experimentally in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the aim is to understand characteristics of qcd matter such as its equation of state ( eos ) , collective behaviour or transport properties which have a wide range of implications in cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "while the equation of state describes the system in thermal equilibrium , the transport coefficients , such as viscosities , characterize the system s ability to relax from nonequilibrium towards equilibrium .",
    "the success of perfect fluid hydrodynamic calculations in describing the collective flow observed in heavy - ion collisions  @xcite suggests small viscosities of the created medium which has also lead to viewing it as being strongly coupled  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , in particular the shear viscosity can not be arbitrarily small due to unitarity  @xcite . besides , in weak coupling certain relations hold among different transport coefficients , cf .",
    "e.  g.  @xcite .",
    "apart from the first - principle calculations of bulk ( @xmath0 ) and shear ( @xmath1 ) viscosities by means of lattice qcd  @xcite a variety of other approaches was proposed . among these the rigorous perturbative calculations starting either from the boltzmann equation  @xcite or from the kubo formalism  @xcite have to be mentioned .",
    "besides , considerations employing different spectral functions  @xcite or numerical transport calculations of the boltzmann equation  @xcite have been made .    here , we adress viscosities by viewing the gluon - plasma as composed of quasiparticle excitations . the underlying quasiparticle model ( qpm )",

    "obey dispersion relations , where the entering self - energies @xmath2 , in general , depend on temperature @xmath3 and chemical potential @xmath4 both explicitly and also implicitly via a phenomenological effective coupling @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "we extend this picture to nonequilibrium systems by means of an effective kinetic theory for gluon quasiparticles , i.  e.  @xmath6 in the following .",
    "for a system in nonequilibrium , the gluon quasiparticle dispersion relation no longer depends on an uniquely defined temperature but becomes space - time dependent , @xmath7 . in this case , the space - time dependence of the distribution function @xmath8 is governed by the boltzmann equation @xmath9 \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 $ ] is the collision term . the force @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12 such that the spatial gradient of the self - energy acts as an external force changing the momenta of the quasiparticles between collisions .",
    "the scattering interaction conserves locally energy and momentum which results in a vanishing collision term when multiplied by @xmath13 and integrated over three - momentum @xmath14 .",
    "hence , an energy - momentum tensor @xmath15 can be defined which , as a consequence of the boltzmann equation , obeys energy - momentum conservation @xmath16 under the condition @xmath17 for the mean field @xmath18 . here",
    ", @xmath19 is an auxiliary field  @xcite , @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the number of degrees of freedom . as a result of eq .",
    "( [ equ:3 ] ) , the space - time dependence of the self - energy is determined by the auxiliary field .",
    "thus , the liouville operator @xmath22 on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( [ equ:1 ] ) is a functional of the distribution function @xmath8 itself .    in thermal equilibrium ,",
    "characterized by a local distribution function @xmath23 , where the fluid four - velocity @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 , one has to demand that @xmath26 to recover equilibrium results from the energy - momentum tensor  ( [ equ:2 ] ) .",
    "in fact , by comparing eq .",
    "( [ equ:2 ] ) evaluated for @xmath27 in the local rest frame with @xmath28 , the quasiparticle model expressions for energy density @xmath29 and pressure @xmath30 are recovered , cf .",
    "moreover , eq .  ( [ equ:3 ] ) represents the nonequilibrium generalization of the stationarity condition ensuring thermodynamic self - consistency and also implying that the principles of statistical mechanics assure the physical meaning of @xmath27  @xcite . in this way , @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ equ:2 ] ) represents the general form for an isotropic fluid composed of quasiparticle excitations including only @xmath32 and @xmath33 which , in addition , satisfies thermodynamic self - consistency in equilibrium .",
    "the calculation of transport coefficients from @xmath31 as the first - order corrections to thermal equilibrium is straightforward .",
    "assuming small deviations from equilibrium , @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath31 can be decomposed into @xmath36+\\delta t^{\\mu\\nu}[\\delta b]$ ] . expanding @xmath37 in terms of small deviations from its equilibrium value and approximating @xmath38 to lowest order by @xmath39 , @xmath40 to lowest order in @xmath41",
