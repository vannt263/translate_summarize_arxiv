    "if supersymmetry ( susy ) exists at the electroweak scale , then gluinos and squarks will be copiously produced in pairs at the lhc and will decay via cascades involving other susy particles to the lightest susy particle ( lsp ) , the @xmath4 . in most models",
    "the @xmath4 is stable , must be neutral and therefore escapes the detector .",
    "it should then be easy to observe deviations from the standard model such as an excess of events with multiple jets plus missing energy @xmath5 or with like - sign dileptons @xmath6 plus @xmath5@xcite .",
    "determining susy masses is more difficult because each susy event contains two lsp s , and there are not enough kinematic constraints to determine the momenta of these .",
    "the strategy developed in ref.@xcite and in this paper involves three steps .",
    "first , we use a simple inclusive analysis to establish a deviation from the standard model .",
    "we select events with at least four jets and large missing energy and plot the distribution of @xmath7 typically , this is dominated by standard model processes at low @xmath8 but is a factor of 510 larger than the standard model prediction for large @xmath8 . the value of @xmath8 at which the signal exceeds that standard model backgrounds provides a first estimate of the susy masses .",
    "the second step in the strategy is to identify characteristic signatures of particles occurring near the end of the susy decay cascades and to use these as the starting point for further analysis .",
    "this is best explained by an example .",
    "suppose that gluinos are slightly heavier than squarks and that @xmath9 is kinematically allowed",
    ". then one can have the following decay chain : @xmath10 such an event typically contains two hard jets from the @xmath11 decays , two @xmath12 jets from the @xmath13 decay , large @xmath5 , and soft jets from the gluino decays and from gluon radiation . in this case , one can reconstruct @xmath14 as a peak in the @xmath15 mass distribution and measure its mass@xcite . then the @xmath13 can be combined with either of the two hard jets .",
    "the smaller of these two masses must be less than the squark mass and so has a sharp edge that measures a known function of the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 masses .",
    "in many cases several such measurements can be made to determine several combinations of masses more or less precisely .",
    "given actual data , the third step would be to make a global fit of a susy model to all available measurements , including both the precision measurements just described and more inclusive ones such as the jet , lepton , and @xmath12-jet multiplicities and @xmath19 distributions .",
    "such an analysis involves simulating large numbers of signal samples and is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "instead , we try to determine the susy parameters using just the precision measurements of combinations of masses . in some cases",
    "this almost completely determines the susy model , while in others it significantly constrains it .",
    ".sugra parameters for the five lhc points.[params ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     if @xmath20 is near its kinematic limit , then the velocity difference between the @xmath21 pair and the @xmath4 is minimized in the rest frame of @xmath22 .",
    "having both leptons hard requires @xmath23 . assuming this and @xmath24 implies that the endpoint in figure  [ c5_mll ] is equal to the @xmath4 mass .",
    "an improved estimate could be made by detailed fitting of all the kinematic distributions .",
    "events were selected with @xmath25 , and the @xmath4 momentum was calculated using this crude @xmath4 mass and @xmath26 the invariant mass @xmath27 of the @xmath21 , the highest @xmath19 jet , and the @xmath4 was then calculated and is shown in figure  [ c5_mlljh ] .",
    "a broad peak is seen near the light squark masses , 660@xmath28 .",
    "this peak contains complementary information to that obtained from figure  [ c5_mbbj ] and more information about the masses could be obtained by performing a combined fit .",
    "a detailed analysis of the dilepton mass spectrum would require varying @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and the @xmath32 distribution and fitting the distributions of @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 . rather than do this ,",
    "a sample of 50k events with @xmath37 but otherwise the same parameters was generated .",
    "a comparison of some of the relevant masses is shown in table  [ masses ] ; the slepton mass changes by @xmath38 , and the rest are essentially identical .",
    "the @xmath33 mass distribution near the edge is shown in figure  [ c5p20_mll ] .",
    "there is a shift in the location of the edge by about @xmath39 , which should be observable .",
    "there is not much change in the @xmath19 distribution of the @xmath40 pair , figure  [ c5p20_ptll ] .",
    "the most sensitive distribution is @xmath36 , where by definition @xmath41 .",
    "there is a clear change in the shape , as one would expect . for fixed values of the other parameters , one ought to be able to determine @xmath42 to @xmath43 ,",
    "although careful subtraction of standard model backgrounds will be necessary .",
    "gluino decays at lhc point  5 have a sizable branching ratio to @xmath44 .",
    "we have attempted to isolate such a sample by searching for top decays . in order to reduce the background from standard model top production ,",
    "the cut on @xmath8 has been raised to @xmath45 for this analysis .",
    "the event selection is as follows :    * @xmath46 ; * @xmath47 jets with @xmath48 , @xmath49 ; * transverse sphericity @xmath50 ; * @xmath51 ; * @xmath52 .",
    "* exactly two b - jets with @xmath53 .",
    "if the invariant mass of the two-@xmath12 system is within @xmath54 gev of the higgs mass , the event is rejected . to search for @xmath55",
    ", we calculate the invariant mass of all dijet combinations with both jets having @xmath56 gev and with neither jet being tagged as a b. combinations with @xmath57 mass are considered w candidates .",
    "combinations where @xmath58 are used to model the shape of the background ; we will refer to these events as the @xmath59 sideband region .",
    "the @xmath60 distribution is shown in figure  [ c5-w - for - top ] where a clear @xmath59 peak is visible .",
    "the average jet multiplicity in these events is @xmath61 and hence there is a large combinatorial background in this figure .",
    "dijets in the @xmath59 mass and @xmath59 sideband regions are then combined with each of the two @xmath12 jets , giving two combinations for each @xmath59 .",
    "results of this reconstruction for the @xmath59 signal and sideband regions are shown in figure  [ c5-marjietopu ] .",
    "subtraction of the sideband distribution from the signal yields figure  [ c5-marjietop ] . a clear top signal is seen .",
    "there is a small background of standard model production of top quarks , shown as the hatched histogram on this figure .",
    "the dominant decay chain giving rise to this signal is @xmath62 the kinematics of the decay @xmath63 , @xmath64 restricts the @xmath65 invariant mass distribution to be between 203 and 356  gev .",
    "there is some evidence in figure  [ c5-marjietop ] for an excess of events in this region .",
    "unfortunately , other possible combinations and decays such as @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , which has a smaller combined branching fraction , make the exact interpretation difficult .",
    "thus , when discussing the determination of susy parameters in section  [ sec : scan-5 ] , we assume that top decays in susy events can be seen at point 5 ( indicating that the @xmath69 channel is open ) , but we will not assume that the @xmath70 mass can be determined .",
    "lhc points 1 and 2 have gluino masses of about 1  tev and squark masses about 50  gev lighter .",
    "these are close to the upper limit of the expected range if susy is to be relevant to electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "the cross sections are quite small , so more than @xmath73 is needed for precision studies . only a few results will be presented here .",
    "this analysis is very similar to the one for lhc point  5 , but since the signal cross sections are smaller , harder cuts are needed :    * @xmath46 ; * @xmath47 jets with @xmath75 , @xmath76 @xmath77 ; * transverse sphericity @xmath50 ; * @xmath51 ; * @xmath52 .",
    "events with exactly two tagged @xmath12 jets were then selected .",
    "figures  [ c1_mbb ] and [ c2_mbb ] show the @xmath15 mass distributions for points 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "the light higgs would be discovered in this mode at either point with @xmath73 or less , although @xmath78 would still be needed to provide the most precise mass determination .",
    "events passing these cuts and having a @xmath79 mass within @xmath80 of the peak were then selected .",
    "these events were also required to have two and only two additional jets with @xmath81 .",
    "this cut is quite inefficient , but attempts to improve its efficiency produced more background .",
    "each of the two jets was combined with the @xmath79 pair .",
    "the smaller of the two masses was selected for each event and plotted in figures.[c1_mbbj ] and [ c2_mbbj ] .",
    "the endpoints for the decay sequence @xmath82 are 739  gev and 751  gev respectively .",
    "measurement of this edge will be limited by statistics to @xmath83 for @xmath73 .",
    "sleptons are quite heavy for lhc points 1 and 2 , so there is no edge in the dilepton mass spectrum as for point  5",
    ". there is , however , a @xmath85 signal that can be used to distinguish these otherwise rather similar points .",
    "the basic selection cuts given at the beginning of the previous subsection were applied .",
    "in addition , the events were required to have two opposite - sign , same - flavor leptons with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 in a cone @xmath89 .",
    "the mass of the two highest @xmath19 such leptons is shown in figure  [ c1_mll ] and figure  [ c2_mll ] for lhc points 1 and 2 respectively .",
    "the @xmath90 peak is questionable for point  1 but rather clear for point  2 , which has larger @xmath91 and hence more mixing of gauginos and higgsinos . even for point  2",
    ", however , the statistical error on the number of @xmath90 s is @xmath92 .",
    "clearly this is a measurement that needs higher luminosity .",
    "there are also observable signals in the like - sign and in the opposite - sign , opposite - flavor dilepton channels",
    ". these would certainly be useful in a global fit , but they do not seem to provide the sort of precise measurements being considered in this paper .",
    "once a number of quantities have been measured , we can attempt to determine the particular susy model and the values of the parameters",
    ". the strategy will be to attempt to perform a global fit to the model parameters using all of the available data , much as the standard model is tested using the @xmath59 and @xmath90 masses and the many quantities precisely measured by lep / slc .",
    "such a fit is beyond the scope of our work , and we adopt a simpler procedure .",
    "we assume that from measurements of global parameters such as those discussed in section  [ sec : meff ] we know the approximate scale of the superpartner masses and have some idea that we might be in a sugra model .",
    "the object is then to determine the parameters of that model and check its consistency .",
    "we must therefore determine the parameters @xmath42 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath91 and @xmath95 . as we will see @xmath94 is difficult to determine .",
    "its value is given at the unification scale , and the value that is relevant for the phenomenology is the one evolved down to the electroweak scale .",
    "many choices of @xmath94 evolve to the same ( fixed point ) value , so there is reduced sensitivity to its value at the unification scale .",
    "in addition it always appears scaled by the yukawa coupling for the relevant quark or lepton .",
    "hence its effect on lepton masses and on the quarks of the first two generations is very small .",
    "its effect is significant for top squarks and at large @xmath91 for bottom squarks .",
    "our strategy for determining the parameters is as follows .",
    "we choose a point randomly in parameter space and compute the spectrum .",
    "we assign a probability to this point determined from how well it agrees with our `` measured quantities '' using our estimates of the errors on those quantities .",
    "the process is repeated for many points and the probabilities used to determine the central values of the parameters , their errors and their correlations .",
    "the probability distribution functions are not always gaussian ; the @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) errors quoted below are such that 15.87% of this distribution is below ( above ) the quoted value .",
    "thus , 68.27% of the probability falls within our definition of @xmath98 .      at lhc point  3 ( @xmath99 gev , @xmath100 gev ) , lep will discover @xmath13 and measure its mass .",
    "the relevant error is that from theoretical calculations of the mass in the supergravity model which is likely to dominate the error from the lep measurement .",
    "we will assume an error of @xmath101 .",
    "using the results presented in section  [ sec : lhc3 ] , we assume the following measurements and errors :    * @xmath102  gev , * @xmath103  gev , * @xmath104  gev .    as described above the mass difference @xmath105 is insensitive to the mass assumed for @xmath18 .    using the strategy outlined above we get the following constraint on the parameters :    * @xmath106  gev , * @xmath107  gev , * @xmath108 , * the sign of @xmath109 is determined to be @xmath110 , * @xmath94 is constrained to be greater than @xmath111  gev .",
    "there are no clear correlations between the parameters .",
    "the additional constraint that the average value of the light squark mass is within @xmath54 gev provides no additional restriction on the parameters .",
    "the relevant phenomenological parameter is the value of @xmath112 evolved down to the the electroweak scale .",
    "the relevant values are those for the third generation , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "information on these can only come directly from data on bottom and top squarks . in this case",
    "@xmath113 is not well constrained ; it is allowed to range from @xmath116 to @xmath117 gev . over this",
    "range the mass of the two stop eigenstates varies only slightly from 270 and 320 gev at one end to 260 and 330 gev at the other .",
    "constraining @xmath113 is very challenging as it appears scaled by the small factor of the bottom quark yukawa coupling",
    ".    the degree of precision may be surprising .",
    "over most of the sugra parameter space @xmath17 and @xmath4 are gauginos ( _ i.e. _ , they have no higgsino components ) , @xmath118 then determines @xmath93 . @xmath119 and @xmath120 are then predicted and a consistency check of the model made by the measurement of @xmath121 . information on @xmath42 , is then obtained from @xmath122 and the value of @xmath123 is sufficient to constrain @xmath91 .    the other measurements available at this point are now used to provide powerful consistency checks of the model .",
    "the measurement of the bottom squark and other squark masses and the event rates for isolated leptons without jets discussed in section  [ sec : lhc3 ] are examples .",
    "another example is the branching ratio for @xmath124 .",
    "figure  [ branchfig ] shows this branching fraction for a selection of sugra models that have parameters in the slightly larger range @xmath125 gev , @xmath126 gev , @xmath127 . at point 3",
    "this branching ratio can be constrained using the method described in section  [ sub : br];.      at lhc point  5 ( @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 ) , @xmath13 will be discovered at lhc in its decay to @xmath132 from its production in the decays of supersymmetric particles , and its mass will be measured precisely from its decay to @xmath133 . using the results presented in section  [ sec : lhc5 ] , we assume the following set of measurements :    * @xmath134  gev , * the decay @xmath135 is allowed , * the end point of the spectrum in figure  [ c5_mbbj ] is @xmath136 gev , * @xmath137 gev .",
    "these results correspond to two possible solutions :    * @xmath138 gev , * @xmath139 gev , * @xmath140 , * @xmath141 ;    and    * @xmath142 gev , * @xmath143 gev , * @xmath144 , * @xmath145 .",
    "both of these solutions provide good fits to the `` data '' . while there is no constraint on @xmath112 ,",
    "the values of @xmath114 and @xmath113 are constrained : @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) gev and @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) gev for @xmath109 positive ( negative ) .",
    "the main differences between the mass spectra for these two solutions are in the masses of @xmath150 , @xmath151 , @xmath152 , and @xmath153 and the masses of the heavier higgs bosons ; they are significantly larger in the positive @xmath109 case .",
    "the claimed sensitivity to the lepton decay spectrum ( see figure  [ c5p20_pt2pt1 ] ) of @xmath154 gev implies that this parameter s range can be narrowed somewhat .",
    "we have not investigated the sensitivity of this spectrum to the sign of @xmath109 . at this point",
    "the errors used ( except for the one on @xmath123 ) are limited by statistics , so additional luminosity will cause the errors to drop . using 0.6 gev for the error on the dilepton endpoint and 23 gev for the error on the endpoint of figure  [ c5_mbbj ] reduces the errors on @xmath93 and @xmath42 to @xmath155 and @xmath156 ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) respectively for positive ( negative ) @xmath109 ; the error on @xmath91 is not reduced .    as well as the differences in the masses of the heavier higgs and gauginos noted above",
    ", the negative sign solution has larger stop masses and hence a smaller branching ratio for @xmath159 .",
    "we have investigated the sensitivity of the top quark signal discussed in section [ subsec : top ] to the sign of @xmath109 .",
    "the parameters @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath145 , and @xmath163 gev have the opposite sign of @xmath109 from point  5 but give an excellent fit to the `` data '' used for fitting at this point . a sample of 100k events was generated for this parameter set , and the analysis leading to figure  [ c5-marjietop ] was repeated .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ c51-marjietop ] ; note that the bins in this figure are twice as wide as those in figure  [ c5-marjietop ] .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the amount of reconstructed top in susy events is reduced relative to that at point  5 and that this fact can be used to eliminate this alternative solution .",
    "in addition , the solutions with @xmath145 have smaller branching ratios of @xmath164 so the observed number of higgs events should be able to severely constrain this case .      at lhc point  4 ( @xmath165 , @xmath166 , @xmath167 ) , determination of the parameters",
    "can not be done by the simple method already described . here",
    "only two masses can be measured in a straightforward manner ; the light higgs mass from its decay to @xmath133 and the @xmath168 mass difference from the endpoint in the dilepton mass distribution .",
    "we use these two measurements and the determination of the susy scale from the @xmath8 analysis of section  [ sec : meff ] :    * @xmath169 , * @xmath170  gev , * @xmath171 gev from the @xmath8 analysis .",
    "these constraints restrict the parameter space to two regions :    * @xmath172  gev , * @xmath173 gev , * @xmath174 , * @xmath112 is not constrained , * @xmath141 , * @xmath175 gev and @xmath176 gev ;    or    * @xmath177 , * @xmath178 , * @xmath179 gev , * @xmath112 is not constrained , * @xmath145 * @xmath180 gev and @xmath181gev .    the uncertainty on @xmath182 is limited by statistics at low luminosity .",
    "a reduction in its error would reduce the error on @xmath93 .    in order to constrain parameters further , models whose parameters are consistent with these values",
    "would need to be generated and their predictions for the distributions shown in figures  [ c4_mllm0 ] , [ c4_mllemu ] , and [ c4_mllemudif ] calculated .",
    "those which are inconsistent with the `` observed '' distribution can then be rejected .",
    "this exercise is beyond the scope of this paper .      at lhc point  1 and 2 ( @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath72 ) , event rates are low and precision measurements difficult at low luminosity .",
    "we use the following constraints .",
    "* @xmath185  gev for point  1 , or * @xmath186  gev for point  2 , * @xmath187 gev from the @xmath8 , * the end point of the spectrum in figure  [ c5_mbbj ] is @xmath188  gev .    in the case of point  1",

    "the lack of a constraint on @xmath42 at these points is alarming but can be explained .",
    "@xmath93 is large and the renormalization group scaling from the gut scale forces the squark masses to be comparable to the gluino mass almost independent of the input value of @xmath42 . in cases of this type one needs to measure slepton masses which are less affected since their renormalization group scaling is controlled by @xmath200 rather than @xmath201 . since",
    "the slepton masses are of order 500 gev , this is a difficult task .",
    "even a lower bound on the masses would constrain @xmath42 .    if we reduce the error on the end point of the spectrum in figure  [ c5_mbbj ] to 20 gev which might be achievable with high luminosity running at lhc , the uncertainty on @xmath93 reduces to @xmath202 gev . as in the case of point  5 ,",
    "the decay @xmath203 is allowed .",

    "the difference in branching ratios is even greater , again enabling elimination of the @xmath145 solution .",
    "in this paper we have outlined a strategy that can be used to systematically explore supersymmetry assuming that it is discovered at the lhc .",
    "we have given an example of a global variable ( @xmath8 ) that can be used to determine the mass scale of susy if nature has chosen the sugra model .",
    "such global variables will be used to give the first indication of a signal independent of the type of susy model .",
    "the production of heavy mass states virtually guarantees that events with very energetic jets will exist .",
    "other susy models such as those with @xmath208parity violation @xcite may have no missing @xmath209 if the lsp decays within the detector .",
    "if the lsp decays to leptons , then all susy events will have leptons and they can be used in a global variable .",
    "if the lsp decays to hadrons , the jet multiplicity will rise and a variable similar to @xmath8 should be effective .",
    "more detailed exploration will depend on the particular susy model . in the sugra models",
    ", there is a general feature , namely that the second lightest neutralino almost always decays to @xmath210 if the channel is open and to @xmath211 with a substantial branching fraction if it is not . in the former case",
    ", this will be the dominant source of @xmath13 and it will be discovered in this process via its decay to @xmath212 if it has not been seen at lep . in the latter case",
    "the measurement of the position of the end point in the @xmath21 mass distribution provides a very precise measurement of the mass difference between two of the sparticles .",
    "after first observing one of these signals , one will move up the decay chain to determine other quantities .",
    "we have then illustrated , using specific examples , some techniques that can be used to determine masses and branching ratios of sparticles .",
    "some of these quantities were then used to determine the fundamental parameters of the sugra model some of which can be determined with great precision .",
    "the ultimate goal of such studies would be to use very many measurements to make an overconstrained fit to the model , rather in the same way that current data are used to test the standard model @xcite      this work was begun during the summer study organized by the division of particles and fields of the american physical society .",
