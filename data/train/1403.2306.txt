    "turbulence is ubiquitous in space and astrophysical plasmas . in the heliosphere ,",
    "it plays a critical role in plasma heating and the scattering of cosmic rays and energetic solar particles .",
    "given the availability of detailed _ in situ _ measurements from a broad range of heliophysics missions , the near - earth solar wind is an ideal environment in which to study the fundamental nature of plasma turbulence . in the solar wind , the primary focus is the transport of energy from large scale turbulent motions to the small length scales at which the turbulence may be dissipated and the energy ultimately converted to plasma heat .",
    "key questions at the forefront of solar wind turbulence investigations are : ( i ) what are the characteristics of the turbulent fluctuations ? ; ( ii ) what are the properties of the nonlinear interactions that drive the turbulent cascade of energy ? ; and ( iii ) what are the physical dissipation mechanisms that damp the turbulence and ultimately lead to plasma heating ?",
    "the answers to each of these questions are interdependent .",
    "in particular , the nature of the electromagnetic and plasma fluctuations underlying the turbulence constrains the possible dissipation mechanisms .",
    "the definitive determination of the characteristics of the turbulent fluctuations , however , is made difficult due to the fact that the bulk of current _ in situ _ solar wind observations are single point measurements .",
    "the taylor hypothesis @xcite is typically invoked , because of the super - alfvnic velocity of the solar wind near 1 au , to transform from the observed frequency of the advected turbulent fluctuations to a length scale of the fluctuations . for low frequency fluctuations with @xmath1 and with the exception of a small number of studies of solar wind turbulence employing analyses based on multi - spacecraft measurements",
    ", we have no knowledge of the frequency of the fluctuations in the rest frame of the solar wind plasma .",
    "this limitation drives the quest to exploit alternative means to illuminate the character of the turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind . a wide range of characteristics , including polarizations , helicities , and other transport ratios",
    "have previously been used to decipher the dynamics of space plasmas @xcite . here",
    "we employ the magnetic helicity as a sensitive probe for turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind .",
    "the _ fluctuating magnetic helicity _ , defined as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the fluctuations of the vector potential and magnetic field , was first proposed as a useful metric for studying turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind by @xcite .",
    "the _ reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity _ , @xmath5 @xcite ,",
    "is related to @xmath6 but is derivable from single - point spacecraft measurements and is a function of spacecraft - frame frequency @xmath7 , @xcite : @xmath8}{\\omega_{sc}/v_{sw}}\\\\ & \\times \\delta[\\omega_{sc}- ( { \\mathbf{k}}\\cdot { \\mathbf{v_{sw } } } + \\omega ) ] , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the solar wind velocity .",
    "normalizing @xmath10 by the trace power @xmath11 yields the _ normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity _ , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the projection of the wavevector along the direction of the solar wind .",
    "the normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity is bound between @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for simplicity , throughout this paper the simplified term  magnetic helicity \" is used instead of the more cumbersome ",
    "normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity \" .",
    "spacecraft measurements of @xmath16 in the near - earth solar wind at low spacecraft - frame frequencies , @xmath17 , typically give values that fluctuate about zero , which was originally interpreted as an admixture of waves with left - handed @xmath18 and right - handed @xmath19 magnetic helicities @xcite .",
    "based on the eigenfunctions of the linear vlasov - maxwell dispersion relation , @xcite later showed that , at large - scales @xmath20 , the linear waves have very small intrinsic magnetic helicity , @xmath21 , which eliminated the need for an explanation in terms of a mixture of waves with left- and right - handed helicities . at higher spacecraft - frame frequencies , @xmath22 , _ in situ _",
    "measurements of the magnetic field fluctuations produced an identifiably nonzero value of @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this was initially interpreted as evidence of the damping of left - hand polarized ion cyclotron waves ( icws ) and the persistence of right - hand polarized whistler waves .",
    "subsequently , it was shown that an anisotropic turbulent spectrum of alfvn waves and kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) naturally reproduces both the low and high frequency measurements @xcite .",
    "as kaws have preferentially perpendicular wavevectors , @xmath23 , and icws and whistler waves require sufficiently large parallel wavevectors , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 refer to orientation with respect to the _ local _ mean magnetic field @xmath27 , the kaw model has the added benefit of being compatible with the predominately perpendicular cascade of energy expected from anisotropic magnetized turbulence theories @xcite .",
    "two recent studies @xcite , analyzed the magnetic helicity of solar wind fluctuations as a function of the wave period @xmath28 in the spacecraft frame and the angle @xmath29 between the solar wind velocity @xmath30 and @xmath27 , and discovered two distinct signatures at angles perpendicular and parallel to @xmath27 at spacecraft - frame frequencies @xmath31 hz .",
    "these observations have been interpreted as two separate populations of fluctuations at kinetic scales with wavevectors oriented parallel and perpendicular to the local mean magnetic field @xcite .",
    "we here explore the properties of a model for solar wind turbulence that reproduces the observed behavior of the magnetic helicity . in particular , we show that the properties of the model are tightly constrained by spacecraft observations of the magnetic helicity plotted as a function of period and angle .",
    "this study employs the _ synthetic spacecraft data method _ @xcite , in which synthetic time series measurements of the magnetic field  measurements that may be directly compared to spacecraft observations  are generated by sampling along a trajectory through the model plasma volume .",
    "the turbulent fluctuations in this model are derived from a distribution of linear wave modes with random phases , where the particular distribution of wave power is guided by modern plasma turbulence theory , and where the physical properties of the wave modes are derived from linear kinetic plasma physics .",
    "the model s ability to reproduce the observed magnetic helicity structure is used to constrain the underlying parameters describing the distribution of turbulent wave power , shedding light on the nature of the turbulent fluctuations in the weakly collisional solar wind plasma .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : mag_hel ] provides background on the germane aspects of recent _ in situ _",
    "magnetic helicity measurements as well as a discussion of the underlying linear kinetic plasma theory .",
    "a description of and justification for the underlying turbulence model is given in section [ sec : turbulence ] .",
    "the general method used to generate the synthetic data and the particular results are found in section [ sec : synth ] .",
    "discussion of these results and a conclusion follow in sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : summary ] respectively .",
    "in this section , we review the observations of magnetic helicity in solar wind turbulence and outline the linear kinetic physics that determines the magnetic helicity of each of the characteristic linear wave modes .       computed from observations by the _ ulysses _ spacecraft , plotted as a function of period and angle for interval i. previous studies have suggested that the perpendicular signature is due to kinetic alfvn waves ( kaws ) and the parallel signature is due to either whistler or ion cyclotron waves ( icws ) @xcite .",
    "the horizontal dashed line indicates the period approximately corresponding to @xmath32.,width=292 ]    although magnetic helicity has long been used to investigate the nature of turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind @xcite , only recently has it been shown by plotting the magnetic helicity of the turbulent fluctuations as a function of period and angle that there exist two distinct signatures of the magnetic helicity at scales near @xmath32 @xcite . employing a wavelet analysis of _ in situ _ magnetic field measurements ,",
    "both studies calculated @xmath16 as a function of the wave period @xmath28 in the spacecraft frame and the angle @xmath29 between the solar wind velocity @xmath9 and _ local _ mean magnetic field @xmath33 .",
    "this method showed that , in a majority of the measurements , there appear two distinct signatures : ( i ) a broad feature with positive magnetic helicity at large angles centered around @xmath34 , and ( ii ) a more narrow feature with negative magnetic helicity at small angles @xmath35 .",
    "we denote these distinct features as the _ perpendicular _ and _ parallel signature _ , respectively .",
    "these features are clearly visible in figure  [ fig : sept17 ] , a plot of the magnetic helicity @xmath16 as a function of period @xmath28 and angle @xmath29 , computed from one of the same _ ulysses _ spacecraft data intervals as analyzed by @xcite .",
    "we note that if the measurements are summed over all angles @xmath29 to obtain a frequency spectrum of the magnetic helicity @xmath36 , the signature of the negative magnetic helicity at small angles @xmath35 is completely masked by the positive helicity at large angles @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "an important difference in the results of @xcite and @xcite is the magnitude of the maximum value of the parallel magnetic helicity signature . in @xcite ,",
    "the observed maximum value of @xmath37 for the parallel signature is approximately @xmath38 while @xcite found a maximum value that is consistently near @xmath39 .",
    "this difference persists even when analyzing essentially the same interval of stereo data .",
    "the different results may be due to subtle differences between the analysis techniques employed in the two studies ; further work is needed to identify the cause of these differences . all analysis undertaken and results presented in this study are based upon the observations found in @xcite .",
    "several hypotheses have been proposed to account for the qualitative features of the magnetic helicity plot seen in figure  [ fig : sept17 ] .",
    "the perpendicular signature was suggested to arise from an anisotropic distribution of kaws with @xmath40 @xcite or from a spectrum of whistler waves @xcite .",
    "the parallel signature was proposed to arise from icws propagating along the magnetic field away from the sun @xcite or whistler waves propagating along the magnetic field toward to the sun @xcite .",
    "temperature anisotropy instabilities , such as the electromagnetic ion cyclotron instability and the parallel firehose instability , have been proposed to generate these parallel propagating waves @xcite .",
    "the maximum growth rate of these instabilities occurs at length scales near the ion inertial length , @xmath41 @xcite , as shown in figure  [ fig : unstable ] , which may explain why the parallel signature is localized near periods @xmath42 .    [ cols=\"^,<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a comparison between plots of @xmath16 as a function of angle @xmath29 and period @xmath28 derived from observational data ( left column ) and from synthetic spacecraft data using either parallel icws ( center column ) or parallel whistler waves ( right column ) is shown in figure  [ fig : grid ] for the three intervals .",
    "the values yielding the best fit for each of the parameters are presented in table  [ tab : fit_icw ] for models using parallel icws and in table  [ tab : fit_whistler ] for models using parallel whistler waves .",
    "an important inclusion in these tables is the range of variation of each of these values within which the fit did not degrade noticeably .    for each interval ,",
    "the five adjustable parameters , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , were varied to obtain the best correspondence by eye between the observed and synthetic magnetic helicity plots .",
    "the value of @xmath48 was chosen to be unidirectional , @xmath49 to yield the maximum amplitude signal for the parallel signature .",
    "the values of @xmath46 and @xmath47 where chosen to match the maximum and minimum periods of the dominant parallel signature .",
    "the value of @xmath50 was varied to match the angular extent of the perpendicular signature with the spacecraft measurements while still allowing a parallel structure with @xmath51 .",
    "the value of @xmath44 was adjusted so that the amplitude of the perpendicular signature would match that of the _ in situ _ measurement .",
    "the correspondence between both our models , using either icws or whistlers as the parallel component , and the _ in situ _ measurements is quite good for all three intervals .    the stringent constraints on the parameters of the turbulence model , particularly the power ratio @xmath43 , provides important information about the nature of turbulence in the solar wind .",
    "[ t ]    it is worthwhile demonstrating the sensitivity of the synthetic magnetic helicity plot to variations in the five adjustable parameters : @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath52 , and @xmath47 .",
    "variation in each of these parameters produces a unique effect on the @xmath16 plot , allowing these five parameters to be rather strictly constrained without significant problems of degeneracy .",
    "the variations of the five parameters in this section are performed about the best fit values for interval * i * for combinations of kaw and whistler waves .",
    "qualitatively similar results are found when combining kaw and icws .",
    "the fiducial values for the parameters , shown in table  [ tab : fit_whistler ] , are @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the angular extent of the parallel and perpendicular signatures on the observed magnetic helicity plot strongly constrains the relative power between the parallel and perpendicular waves , @xmath43 . in the top row of figure",
    "[ fig : sens ] , we plot the result of variations in @xmath43 for interval * i * over the range @xmath58 for a combination of parallel whistler waves and perpendicular kaws .",
    "similar results are obtained if one chooses icws instead of whistler waves for the parallel component of the turbulence model . the results in figure  [ fig : sens ]",
    "demonstrate that , for @xmath59 , the parallel signature of @xmath16 is too extended and the perpendicular signature is too limited in angular range to match the observations .",
    "for the three intervals studied here , @xmath43 varies from @xmath60 to @xmath61 ( see tables  [ tab : fit_icw ] and  [ tab : fit_whistler ] for the best fit values and their acceptable ranges ) , but in all cases a majority of the total power is found in the perpendicular wave modes , with only a small fraction of the total wave energy attributed to the parallel wave modes .",
    "the sign and amplitude of @xmath16 for the perpendicular signature determines the allowable range of values for @xmath44 .",
    "the sign of @xmath44 is simply given by the sign of @xmath16 .",
    "the amplitude of @xmath16 for the perpendicular signature allows one to determine the balance of the wave energy fluxes along the local mean magnetic field . specifying a population of unidirectional kaws with @xmath62 yields a magnitude of @xmath16 that is too large , while for a balanced case with @xmath63 , the perpendicular signature disappears .",
    "these cases are clearly demonstrated by comparing the best fit plots in figure  [ fig : grid ] .",
    "the top and bottom rows are rather imbalanced , with @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "the middle row demonstrates a very important feature of the magnetic helicity plot . in this case , the kaw component of the turbulence is much more balanced , with @xmath66 .",
    "although the perpendicular signature has vanished , the angular extent of parallel signature is still restricted to small @xmath29 . in the case",
    "where there is no perpendicular wave energy at all , as shown in the pure parallel cases highlighted in figure  [ fig : single ] , the parallel signature extends to large angles .",
    "therefore , the absence of a perpendicular signature in the magnetic helicity plot does not indicate the absence of a perpendicular kaw turbulent cascade , but rather a case of nearly balanced kaw turbulence .",
    "a brief discussion in @xcite commented on the possibility that the symmetry of the magnetic helicity signature about @xmath67 observed in the solar wind could be indicative of a balanced population of kaws .",
    "as a balanced population of kaws would produce a magnetic helicity of zero , they suggested other mechanisms may be needed to account for the observed nonzero magnetic helicity signature near @xmath67 .",
    "however , the concerns raised by @xcite are invalid . in the appendix",
    ", we prove that the magnetic helicity map is symmetric about @xmath67 .",
    "this proof differs from the one presented by @xcite .",
    "our work with the synthetic time series shows that an imbalanced population of kaws generates a normalized helicity signature that is symmetric about @xmath67 and is consistent with solar wind observations .",
    "this minor comment by @xcite is erroneous and we feel obliged to correct that mistake in this paper .",
    "analogous to the manner in which the perpendicular magnetic helicity signature diminishes as the wave energy fluxes of kaws become more balanced , @xmath68 , the amplitude of the parallel @xmath16 signature diminishes as @xmath69 is reduced from @xmath15 to @xmath70 .",
    "this reduction is shown in the center row of figure [ fig : sens ] , where @xmath48 for a population of whistler waves increases from @xmath14 through @xmath71 to @xmath72 .",
    "as stated in previous studies @xcite , the parallel component must be nearly unidirectional to match the observed amplitude of the parallel signature in @xmath16 .",
    "finally , the region of wavevector space filled by the parallel population of waves is directly constrained by the observed minimum and maximum period of the parallel signature on the magnetic helicity plot .",
    "the maximum period @xmath73 is directly controlled by our model parameter @xmath46 , and the minimum period @xmath74 is directly controlled by @xmath47 .",
    "the observed maximum period of the parallel signature  s. the signal of this largest peak is clearly significant , but it is not clear if the smaller peaks that sometimes appear at @xmath75  s are significant . ] for intervals * i**iii * , as seen in the first column in figure  [ fig : grid ] , has a range of values 6  s @xmath76  s. these values are matched in the turbulence models in figure  [ fig : grid]both icw ( center column ) and whistler ( right column ) models  by setting values of the the minimum parallel wavenumber @xmath77 . likewise , to see the effect of @xmath47 on the observed @xmath74 of the parallel magnetic helicity signature , in the bottom row of figure  [ fig : sens ] , we plot @xmath78 it is clear the increasing @xmath47 has the effect of decreasing @xmath74 of the parallel signature . further discussion of the effect of aliasing on the @xmath74 limit of the parallel signature for the @xmath79 case is presented in section  [ sec : alias ] .",
    "[ t ]    [ t ]    a salient feature of the observed plots of magnetic helicity as a function of angle , @xmath29 , and period in the spacecraft frame , @xmath28 , is that the perpendicular signature drops to zero magnetic helicity , @xmath21 , at the shortest periods , or highest frequencies .",
    "this has previously been interpreted as indicating that the anti - sunward and sunward energy fluxes of the waves responsible for the perpendicular signature are gradually becoming more balanced at smaller scales @xcite . in stark contrast to this interpretation",
    ", we hypothesize here that the observed drop of the perpendicular signature to @xmath21 at the highest frequencies is simply an artifact of aliasing , and we here present evidence in support of this hypothesis .",
    "the sampling interval for the _ ulysses _ measurements presented in figure  [ fig : grid ] is @xmath80  s , leading to a nyquist frequency of @xmath81  hz .",
    "the turbulent magnetic field fluctuations measured in the solar wind certainly contain power at frequencies @xmath82 , so it is inevitable that aliasing will affect the fourier transforms of the measured magnetic field , and this may alter the determination of the magnetic helicity of the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "we explore here how such aliasing impacts the appearance of the plot of magnetic helicity as a function of angle and period .",
    "let us consider how aliasing impacts the magnetic helicity determination for interval * i*. assuming the taylor hypothesis @xcite , the maximum frequency @xmath83 of the magnetic field in our synthetic plasma volume occurs when the probe samples directly along one of the coordinate directions , @xmath84 .",
    "for @xmath85 and @xmath86  s , we obtain @xmath87  hz . note that since we do not sample exactly along the coordinate directions ( @xmath88 or @xmath89 ) , the maximum frequency that we obtain is @xmath90  hz , avoiding the marginally aliased case when sampling at a time resolution of @xmath91  s. therefore , generating synthetic time series with a time resolution of @xmath91  s is sufficient to capture completely all information in the signal without aliasing , since the nyquist frequency for this sampling rate is @xmath92  hz and therefore @xmath93 . constructing a magnetic helicity plot using these @xmath91  s synthetic measurements",
    "leads to the unaliased result plotted in the upper left panel of figure  [ fig : alias ] .",
    "if the synthetic data is instead downsampled to a time resolution of @xmath80  s ( equivalent to simply eliminating every other data point from the @xmath91  s time series ) , the resulting nyquist frequency is @xmath81  hz , and therefore all power at frequencies @xmath82 will be folded back into the frequency range @xmath94 .",
    "this aliasing is illustrated schematically in figure  [ fig : alias2 ] , where the fourier transform of an arbitrary component of the magnetic field , @xmath95 , is plotted not as a function of frequency @xmath96 , but as a function of period @xmath97 , to make more direct connection to the magnetic helicity plot .",
    "the nyquist frequency @xmath81  hz ( long dashed ) therefore corresponds to a nyquist period of @xmath98  s. in this figure , the original turbulent magnetic field signal ( short dashed ) contains power below the nyquist period , @xmath99 .",
    "this power is folded back ( dotted ) , with a 180@xmath100 phase shift , into the range @xmath101 .",
    "this folded power combines with the original signal , leading to the aliased fourier transform , @xmath102 ( solid ) .",
    "note that the scaling of the original signal as a function of period in the diagram in figure  [ fig : alias2 ] corresponds to our turbulence model as described in section  [ sec : parameters ] .",
    "this model yields a magnetic energy frequency spectrum that scales as @xmath103 at @xmath104 and as @xmath105 at @xmath106 .",
    "it is important that a realistic frequency scaling is used to construct the schematic diagram in figure  [ fig : alias2 ] , because the scaling of the amplitude of the signal as a function of frequency , or alternatively as a function of period , determines quantitatively how much of an impact aliasing will have on the final result .    in figure",
    "[ fig : alias2 ] , the difference between the aliased signal ( solid ) and the original signal ( dashed ) as a function of period @xmath28 provides useful guidance to develop intuition about the range of @xmath28 in which aliasing significantly alters the resulting signal . in this case",
    ", the difference between the original and aliased signal at the nyquist period @xmath98  s is the same magnitude as the original signal , indicating that aliasing is likely to have a large effect at this shortest measured period .",
    "the difference remains significant for periods @xmath107  s , suggesting that aliasing will likely affect the resulting magnetic helicity plot for all periods shorter than @xmath108  s , supporting our hypothesis .",
    "we confirm the hypothesis that aliasing leads to the reduction of the magnetic helicity signal at the lowest measured periods using the synthetic data method , as shown in figure  [ fig : alias ] . in the upper right - hand panel ,",
    "the magnetic helicity is plotted for the downsampled @xmath80  s data . here",
    "we expect the magnetic helicity to be affected significantly by aliasing for all periods @xmath109  s , as indicated schematically in figure  [ fig : alias2 ] .",
    "one can clearly see in the upper right - hand panel of figure  [ fig : alias ] that the magnetic helicity of the perpendicular signature indeed drops to @xmath21 at the lowest periods , in qualitative agreement with the observed data for interval * i * plotted in the lower right - hand panel , but starkly different from the unaliased data in the upper left - hand panel .",
    "the effect of aliasing can be eliminated if the original time series is first passed through a low - pass filter to remove all power at frequencies @xmath110 before the measurements are fourier transformed to convert from a time series to a frequency spectrum . in this case ,",
    "a low - pass filter was applied to zero out any frequencies in the range @xmath111  hz .",
    "this filtering was accomplished by the following procedure : ( i ) the @xmath91  s time series is fourier transformed to frequency ; ( ii ) all fourier coefficients for @xmath112 hz are set to zero ; ( iii ) the resulting truncated fourier frequency spectrum is transformed back to a time series ; and ( iv ) the resulting @xmath91  s time series is downsampled to a @xmath80  s time series by eliminating every other data point .",
    "the magnetic helicity plot is then constructed from the resulting dealiased time series , producing the result plotted in the lower left - hand panel of figure  [ fig : alias ] .",
    "a comparison of the four panels plotted in figure  [ fig : alias ] strongly supports our hypothesis that aliasing is responsible for the drop in the magnetic helicity of the perpendicular signal at the lowest periods .",
    "the unaliased magnetic helicity plot is presented in the upper left , created by choosing a sampling time that is short enough to avoid aliasing , @xmath91  s in this case .",
    "the observed magnetic helicity plot ( lower right ) closely resembles the aliased magnetic helicity plot ( upper right ) that was constructed from the downsampled @xmath80  s time series . the dealiased magnetic helicity plot ( lower left ) , constructed by low - pass filtering the data before downsampling , looks significantly different from the observations ( lower right ) , but is identical to the unaliased result ( upper left ) at all periods .",
    "this comparison strongly supports our hypothesis that aliasing significantly affects the appearance of the magnetic helicity plot at the lowest measured periods .",
    "the lesson here is that caution must be exercised not to over - interpret the apparent return of @xmath16 to zero at the lowest periods .",
    "magnetic helicity plots generated from the _ stereo _ mission , presented in figure  4 of @xcite , further support this result .",
    "the sampling time of _ stereo a _",
    "magnetic field measurements is @xmath113  s , yielding a nyquist frequency @xmath114  hz .",
    "although the plasma parameters for this measured interval are not significantly different from the _ ulysses _ measurements presented here , the non - zero @xmath16 of the perpendicular signature extends to much lower periods , @xmath115 .",
    "in addition , the perpendicular signature of the _ stereo _ measurements again drops to @xmath21 at @xmath116  s , as our intuition about the effect of aliasing from figure  [ fig : alias2 ] suggests .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that , for the _ stereo _ measurements above , the low - period cutoff of the parallel signature is a @xmath117  s , a significantly longer period than the nyquist period , @xmath118  s. therefore , these measurements suggest that the parallel signature cutoff is not due to aliasing , in contrast to the case for the perpendicular signature .",
    "the magnetic helicity of the turbulent fluctuations , plotted as a function of period and angle , provides a new avenue for exploring the nature of turbulence in the solar wind .",
    "we have applied the synthetic spacecraft data method to model _ in situ _ magnetic helicity observations and thereby obtained new insights into the nature of the underlying plasma dynamics . using a turbulence model inspired by the current theory for anisotropic alfvnic turbulence and by linear kinetic plasma physics ,",
    "we directly compare synthetic magnetic helicity plots to those obtained from three time intervals measured _ in situ _ by the _",

    "here we explain how the findings in this study provide support for , or conflict with , the results of previous related studies .",
    "this work is motivated by two groundbreaking observational studies of the magnetic helicity of fluctuations in the solar wind .",
    "@xcite were the first to use a wavelet analysis technique to construct the magnetic helicity of the turbulent fluctuations as a function of both the period in the spacecraft frame and the angle between the solar wind flow velocity and the local mean magnetic field .",
    "this investigation used magnetic field measurements in the ecliptic from the _ stereo _ spacecraft .",
    "for an outward magnetic sector , this study found a dominant negative magnetic helicity at small angles @xmath119 , and a broad region of dominantly positive magnetic helicity at @xmath120 . in this work ,",
    "we label the narrow feature with negative magnetic helicity at @xmath121 as the _ parallel signature _ and the broad feature with positive magnetic helicity at @xmath122 as the _",
    "perpendicular signature_. their interpretation was that the parallel signature arises from icws and that the perpendicular signature is caused by kaws or whistler waves .",
    "they speculated that a parallel turbulent cascade of alfvn - cyclotron waves may be responsible for the parallel signature , and that the drop to zero magnetic helicity in the dissipation range was due to the effect of pinning , in which the energy fluxes of sunward and anti - sunward waves gradually become more balanced at smaller scales .    a complementary study by @xcite employed _ ulysses _ measurements at high heliographic latitudes to obtain magnetic helicity results in accord with the earlier ecliptic observations @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the results by @xcite , however , differed substantially from that of @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested that the perpendicular signature was most naturally associated with the anisotropic alfvnic turbulent cascade @xcite , consisting of alfvn waves at mhd scales @xmath20 and kaws at kinetic scales @xmath123 .",
    "in stark contrast to the interpretation of the @xcite , @xcite proposed that the parallel signature is not the result of a parallel turbulent cascade , but rather that it arises from waves driven by kinetic temperature anisotropy instabilities in the solar wind .    in a subsequent detailed study , @xcite argued that , due to the large magnitude of the normalized magnetic helicity associated with the parallel signature , @xmath124 , the waves responsible must propagate nearly unidirectionally .",
    "for outward magnetic sectors , the negative magnetic helicity of the parallel signature could be alternatively explained either by ( i ) icws propagating away from the sun along the interplanetary magnetic field or by ( ii ) whistler waves propagating toward the sun along the interplanetary magnetic field .",
    "they went on to show , in the presence of a significant differential alpha - proton flow along the magnetic field @xmath125 ( where the field - aligned drift velocity @xmath126 ) , two quantitative results that could explain the observations : ( i ) for a temperature anisotropy of the sense @xmath127 , the electromagnetic ion cyclotron ( emic ) instability preferentially generates anti - sunward propagating icws ; and ( ii ) for a temperature anisotropy of the sense @xmath128 , the parallel firehose instability preferentially generates sunward propagating whistler waves .    finally , @xcite employed a simplified analytical model of the turbulent fluctuations , similar to the approach introduced by @xcite , to explore whether a two - component model of parallel ( slab ) and perpendicular ( critically balanced ) alfvnic fluctuations could explain the qualitative and quantitative features of the observed magnetic helicity plot .",
    "this model included a distribution of power in wavevector space with both a distribution of slab ( parallel ) icws and a critically balanced distribution of nearly perpendicular alfvn waves and kaws .",
    "in addition , the model included a prescribed `` imbalance '' function that defined the gradual balancing of anti - sunward and sunward alfvn wave energy fluxes , inspired by the concept of pinning of elsasser power spectra at the dissipation scales .",
    "their study concluded that this two - component , slab plus critical balance model of the turbulence could qualitatively reproduce the parallel and perpendicular signatures of the observed magnetic helicity plots .",
    "in addition , with appropriate tuning of the imbalance function , the reduction of the magnetic helicity to @xmath129 at short periods was also reproduced by the model .",
    "now we turn our attention to how the method and results of the present study compare to those of these previous investigations , focusing initially on the results and interpretation of the perpendicular signature .",
    "one of the questions posed by @xcite was why the perpendicular signature was so broad , extending over roughly the angular range @xmath122 , even though multi - spacecraft measurements of the turbulent fluctuations at these scales @xcite show fluctuations with nearly perpendicular wavevectors , @xmath130 ?",
    "the answer found through application of the synthetic spacecraft data method is that _ the angular width of the perpendicular ( and the parallel ) signatures is controlled by the relative power between perpendicular and parallel wave distributions at the scales associated with spacecraft - frame periods _",
    "@xmath131  s. surprisingly , for a critically balanced distribution of alfvn and kinetic alfvn waves , if they are the only waves present , the perpendicular signature would extend to even smaller angles than observed , as shown in panel ( c ) of figure  [ fig : single ] .",
    "similarly , if only a parallel distribution of whistler waves or icws is present , their parallel signature can extend all the way out to angles near @xmath34 , as shown by panels ( a ) and ( b ) of the same figure .",
    "the limitation of the angular range of both the perpendicular and the parallel signatures is controlled by the relative power between the perpendicular and parallel waves , as demonstrated by the top row of figure  [ fig : sens ] .",
    "the commonly observed transition at @xmath132 requires that the perpendicular waves contain more than 90% of the power in the wavenumber band @xmath133 .",
    "for the three _ ulysses _ intervals that we examined , we obtained values of @xmath43 from 92% to 97% , as presented in tables  [ tab : fit_icw ] and  [ tab : fit_whistler ] .",
    "this contrasts significantly with the model used by @xcite , in which the parallel component had 30% of the total power .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that , due to the statistical averaging of spacecraft measurements over long time intervals ( from one to a few days ) , the waves responsible for the parallel signature may indeed have a much higher relative power , but be spatially intermittent , compared to the anisotropic alfvnic turbulent cascade leading to the perpendicular signature , which is likely to be space - filling .",
    "but , in terms of the total power of magnetic field fluctuations in the solar wind , our results suggest that the parallel waves constitute on average about 5% of the power at scales near @xmath134 .",
    "the magnitude of the magnetic helicity of the perpendicular signature directly provides information about the balance of anti - sunward and sunward alfvn wave energy fluxes , parametrized by the normalized parallel poynting flux , @xmath44 .",
    "the synthetic spacecraft data method enables a determination of the imbalance of wave energy fluxes by adjusting parallel poynting flux until the magnitude of the perpendicular signature from the synthetic plots matches that of the observed plots .",
    "this imbalance may vary significantly between different solar wind intervals , as demonstrated by the three _ ulysses _ investigated here , which yield values for @xmath44 of 0.5 , 0.2 , and @xmath135 , as presented in tables  [ tab : fit_icw ] and  [ tab : fit_whistler ] .",
    "another difference between our study and previous works is the explanation for the observed drop of the magnetic helicity of the perpendicular signature to @xmath21 at the shortest measured periods . @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggest that this is due to a gradual balancing of the anti - sunward and sunward wave energy fluxes , such that @xmath136 decreases in magnitude with decreasing length scale .",
    "we disagree with this interpretation , and show evidence that this decrease of @xmath16 is merely an artifact of aliasing , as shown in figures  [ fig : alias ] and  [ fig : alias2 ] .",
    "therefore , the observations do not necessarily imply that pinning occurs at kinetic scales .",
    "the possibility that the kinetic turbulence becomes balanced at some point in the energy cascade has not been incorporated into our model which assumes that the imbalance in the energy spectrum is scale independent .    turning our attention to the parallel signature of the magnetic helicity plot , we present evidence in support of the idea that the waves responsible for this feature are driven by temperature anisotropy instabilities @xcite , as opposed to the suggestion that a parallel turbulent cascade is responsible for these modes @xcite . in particular ,",
    "when a field - aligned differential alpha - proton velocity occurs , the electromagnetic ion cyclotron ( emic ) instability can drive preferentially anti - sunward icws or the parallel firehose instability can drive preferentially sunward whistler waves @xcite .",
    "the growth rate for these instabilities peaks at scales @xmath41 , as shown in figure  [ fig : unstable ] , so these waves are generated at the kinetic scales associated with the timescale where the parallel signature is observed and therefore , no parallel cascade is necessary .",
    "our synthetic spacecraft data models indeed reproduce the features of the observed magnetic helicity plots when the normalized parallel poynting flux is unidirectional , @xmath137 , and the waves are localized at parallel wavenumbers in the range @xmath138 .",
    "we show from a variation of our model parameters that a unidirectional , or nearly unidirectional , parallel population of waves produces a magnetic helicity plot which most closely fits with observational results ; we do not assume unidirectionallity based upon the theories presented in @xcite .",
    "although @xcite demonstrate that anisotropy instabilities , in the presence of differential alpha - proton drift , can drive either anti - sunward icws or sunward whistlers , they do not attempt to distinguish between these two alternatives based on solar wind data . here",
    "we propose several observational means to address this issue .",
    "first , the parallel firehose instability occurs only for @xmath139 , whereas the emic instability has no such restriction .",
    "note that , due to the super - alfvnic velocities of the solar wind , the waves measured by a spacecraft , whether they are anti - sunward or sunward propagating , will necessarily have been swept past the spacecraft in the anti - sunward direction .",
    "therefore , the waves measured by a spacecraft must have been generated in the solar wind plasma at smaller heliocentric radius . combining this property with the characteristic that the parallel proton plasma beta , @xmath140 , in the solar wind generally increases with heliocentric radius , any waves measured in a plasma with @xmath141 will almost certainly have been generated in a plasma with @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , if an interval of solar wind plasma with @xmath142 contains a parallel magnetic helicity signature , the parallel firehose instability can not have been responsible for the parallel waves . in this case , one would have strong evidence that the emic instability is generating anti - sunward icws in the solar wind .",
    "one can not , on this basis , rule out a contribution from the parallel firehose instability when @xmath139 .    a second way to identify",
    "which wave mode is playing a role in the parallel signature , if the waves are generated locally ( in other words , the waves were generated in the same plasma volume in which they are measured ) , is to measure the proton temperature anisotropy of the plasma .",
    "if the temperature anisotropy is of the sense @xmath127 , then we expect to find anti - sunward propagating icws caused by the emic instability . on the other hand , if the temperature anisotropy is of the sense @xmath143 , then we expect to find sunward propagating whistler waves caused by the parallel firehose instability .",
    "studies based on measured distribution functions have shown that the emic instability driven by the proton temperature anisotropy is likely to operate in high speed streams @xcite .",
    "models of the fast solar wind relevant to the _ ulysses _ measurements presented here @xcite would favor @xmath128 , resulting from perpendicular adiabatic cooling of the protons , but direct _ in situ _ spacecraft measurements demonstrate that the solar wind plasma has intervals with both @xmath128 and @xmath144 @xcite , although in the ecliptic plane at 1 au the condition @xmath128 is observed more often than @xmath144 .",
    "a third way to distinguish anti - sunward icws from sunward whistlers , if electric field measurements are available , is to use electric field measurements to compute the field - aligned poynting flux associated with the parallel signature , @xmath145 . the convection electric field caused by the flow of the magnetized plasma past the electric field probes @xcite",
    "complicates any effort to compute the poynting flux , but , in principle , this approach could conclusively determine which of these two wave modes is responsible .",
    "it should be mentioned that the two instabilities are not necessarily exclusive and that the solar wind magnetic helicity data is consistent with the simultaneous existence of both outward propagating icws and inward propagating whistlers .",
    "the three observational tests described above may prove useful in determining if either one of these instabilities is solely responsible for the quasi - parallel signature or if both instabilities play a role in its creation .    to conclude the discussion of the waves responsible for the parallel signature",
    ", we consider whether these parallel fluctuations are indeed turbulent themselves ( do they transfer energy nonlinearly to small scales ? ) , or do they merely persist in the turbulent environment caused by the anisotropic alfvnic fluctuations responsible for the perpendicular signature .",
    "two properties of the parallel waves argue against them driving an active turbulent cascade .",
    "first , the amplitudes of the parallel fluctuations are small ( since @xmath146 ) , so they may not have sufficient amplitudes for strong nonlinear interactions to occur . if the parallel waves have larger amplitude but are very intermittent , they still may not interact frequently enough for nonlinear interactions to play an important role .",
    "second , the waves are propagating unidirectionally , and in the case of incompressible mhd , alfvn waves traveling in one direction only do not interact nonlinearly @xcite .",
    "since the linear kinetic waves are dispersive at @xmath147 , however , this may enable even unidirectionally propagating waves to interact nonlinearly .",
    "the position that the parallel waves do not cascade ( at least to smaller parallel scales ) is consistent with the observed short period cutoff of the parallel signature , especially for the higher frequency _ stereo _ measurements @xcite . if the parallel waves are icws , this cutoff may be due to the efficient damping of the ion cyclotron resonance .",
    "however , if the parallel population is comprised of whistler waves , the cutoff would likely not be the result of some linear damping mechanism .",
    "this cutoff appears not to be due to aliasing , but actually represents the small parallel scale limit of the parallel waves .",
    "the hypothesis that we propose here is that the parallel waves are indeed not turbulent , but instead persist alongside the anisotropic alfvnic turbulence .",
    "therefore , the parallel magnetic helicity signature is a probe of a kinetic plasma physics mechanisms that operate separately from the turbulent cascade of energy from large to small scales .",
    "motivated by recent novel measurements of the normalized reduced fluctuating magnetic helicity in the solar wind , we undertook in this paper to illuminate the nature of the underlying turbulence through careful comparison of _ in situ _ and synthetic time series .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular signatures which are seen when solar wind observations of magnetic helicity are segregated by period and angle between the local mean magnetic field and solar wind velocity are replicated by synthetic time series derived from physically motivated models of turbulence .",
    "the hypothesis upon which the model is based is that the two signatures result from two distinct wavemode populations in wavevector space , namely a quasi - perpendicular collection of turbulent alfvn / kinetic alfvn fluctuations and a quasi - parallel collection of either whistler or ion cyclotron waves .    in comparing the _ in situ _ and synthetic magnetic helicity plots , we have been able to constrain the model s five free parameters , including the ratio of power contained in quasi - parallel versus quasi - perpendicular modes as well as the power ratio of sunward to anti - sunward modes for each of these two populations . from these comparisons , we conjecture that the parallel signature is not due to a cascade of energy to smaller parallel scales but is more likely due to a local injection of parallel energy from temperature anisotropy instabilities .",
    "these parallel modes may not be turbulent , existing along side and having little or no interaction with the cascade of energy to smaller perpendicular scales .",
    "magnetic helicity alone is not sufficient to determine the nature of the parallel fluctuations , but we make several suggestions for a future determination of their nature . we discuss the effects of aliasing and show that the reduction of magnetic helicity amplitude to zero at small periods , which has been interpreted as evidence for an increasingly balanced turbulent cascade at smaller scales , is likely caused by aliasing and is not a physical effect . in conclusion ,",
    "careful comparisons between magnetic helicity measurements and synthetic spacecraft data is capable of providing useful insight into the underlying nature of solar wind turbulence .",

    "in this appendix we show that , for angles in the range @xmath149 , the magnetic helicity map derived from synthetic spacecraft data is symmetric about the angle @xmath150 .",
    "consider a spacecraft ( or observer ) moving with uniform velocity @xmath151 along a line oriented at an angle @xmath152 with respect to the direction of the constant background field @xmath33 , where @xmath153 .",
    "as described in section 4.1 , the magnetic helicity spectrum @xmath154 is computed using equations 4 and 5 from the magnetic field data @xmath155 taken as the spacecraft moves along that line from point @xmath156 to point @xmath157 .",
    "suppose , instead , that the spacecraft moves along the same line but in the opposite direction from point @xmath157 to point @xmath156 with velocity @xmath158 . in that case , the observations yield the magnetic helicity spectrum at an angle @xmath159 .",
    "thus , the magnetic helicity observed at the angle @xmath160 is based on those same observations taken at angle @xmath161 but in the reverse order : @xmath162 .",
    "the only other difference is that the system of basis vectors will be different . if @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 are the right - handed system of unit vectors employed along the trajectory from @xmath156 to point @xmath157 , then along the opposite trajectory from @xmath157 to @xmath156 we may use the right - handed system of unit vectors @xmath166 , @xmath164 , @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , the calculation of the discrete fourier transform @xmath168 in equation 5 for @xmath161 , @xmath169 becomes , along the opposite trajectory for @xmath160 , @xmath170 where the minus sign on the right - hand side is used for the components @xmath171 and @xmath172 , and the plus sign is used for the component @xmath173 .",
    "we can rewrite equation  [ eqn : theta1 ] as @xmath174 or , equivalently , @xmath175^*,\\ ] ] where the asterisk denotes the complex conjugate .",
