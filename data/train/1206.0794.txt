    "as exotic natures of unstable nuclei such as the new magic numbers and the neutron halos are disclosed by experiments , microscopic studies based on the nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath4 ) interaction become even more desired in nuclear structure physics . while the fully microscopic @xmath4 ( and @xmath5 ) interaction is still too complicated to cover large volume of nuclei in the periodic table despite significant progress  @xcite , the semi - realistic @xmath4 interactions have been developed  @xcite by modifying the michigan 3-range yukawa ( m3y ) interaction  @xcite , which was originated from brueckner s @xmath6-matrix at the nuclear surface and expressed by the yukawa functions .",
    "the modification has been made so that the saturation and the spin - orbit ( @xmath7 ) splitting should be reproduced within the mean - field approximation ( mfa ) .",
    "owing to the recently developed numerical methods  @xcite , self - consistent calculations in the mfa  @xcite and in the random - phase approximation ( rpa )  @xcite have been implemented using the semi - realistic interactions . among the advantages of the m3y - type semi - realistic interactions",
    "is that they contain realistic tensor channels as well as correct longest - range central channels originating from the one - pion exchange , which have been pointed out to play significant roles in @xmath8- or @xmath9-dependence of the shell structure  @xcite .",
    "the semi - realistic interactions are suitable to investigate effects of these channels within the self - consistent mfa and rpa  @xcite .    while the parameter - sets of the m3y - type interactions in refs .",
    "@xcite were adjusted to the data on the nuclear structure , some of them have been applied to the nuclear reactions  @xcite and to the neutron stars  @xcite as well . in studying structure of the neutron stars ,",
    "density - dependence of the symmetry energy is crucially important  @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the symmetry energy at low density is significant in nuclear reactions : _",
    "e.g. _ the charge - exchange reactions  @xcite and the multi - fragmentation processes  @xcite",
    ". the symmetry energy at low density may also affect the so - called pygmy dipole resonance in neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite . however , the symmetry energy , particularly its density - dependence , was not sufficiently reliable in the previous parameter - sets in refs .",
    "@xcite as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , giving rise to instability of the symmetric nuclear matter at the density @xmath10 , which is not consistent with microscopic calculations  @xcite . in this article",
    ", we shall propose new parameter - sets of the m3y - type semi - realistic @xmath4 interaction .",
    "as far as the energy of the symmetric nuclear matter is fixed , the symmetry energy at each density is well connected to the energy of the neutron matter .",
    "the new parameters are determined by fitting the neutron - matter energy to microscopic result in ref .",
    "@xcite ( fp ) or @xcite ( apr ) .",
    "moreover , we additionally take into consideration the binding energy of @xmath0sn .",
    "as argued later , the symmetry energy at the saturation point tends to be fixed with good precision by fitting the parameters both to @xmath0sn and @xmath11sn .",
    "the symmetry energy is thus constrained to good degree in the new parameter - sets .",
    "corresponding to the microscopic results on the neutron - matter energy , we obtain two parameter - sets ` m3y - p6 ' ( fitted to fp ) and ` m3y - p7 ' ( to apr ) .",
    "although the parameters are determined from a limited number of data , they will be useful for investigating various aspects of nuclear properties , as will be illustrated by separation energies of the proton- and neutron - magic nuclei and by @xmath8- or @xmath9-dependence of shell structure .",
    "we take a non - relativistic isoscalar nuclear hamiltonian of @xmath12 with @xmath13 and @xmath14 representing the indices of individual nucleons .",
    "we set @xmath15 throughout this paper , where @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) is the mass of a proton ( a neutron )  @xcite . for the effective @xmath4 interaction @xmath18 , the following form is considered , @xmath19^{\\alpha^{(\\mathrm{se } ) } }   + t_\\rho^{(\\mathrm{te } ) } p_\\mathrm{te}\\cdot   [ \\rho(\\mathbf{r}_i)]^{\\alpha^{(\\mathrm{te})}}\\big )   \\,\\delta(\\mathbf{r}_{ij})\\ , , \\label{eq : effint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 is the spin operator of the @xmath13-th nucleon , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 denotes the nucleon density .",
    "the tensor operator is defined by @xmath26 $ ] with @xmath27 .",
    "the projection operators on the singlet - even ( se ) , triplet - even ( te ) , singlet - odd ( so ) and triplet - odd ( to ) two - particle states are @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) expresses the spin ( isospin ) exchange operator .",
    "the yukawa function @xmath31 is assumed for all channels except @xmath32 .",
    "the density - dependent contact term @xmath32 is added in order to reproduce the saturation properties .",
    "physically , @xmath32 may carry effects of the @xmath5 interaction and of the density - dependence that is dropped in the original m3y interaction .",
    "we start from the m3y - paris interaction  @xcite , which will be denoted by m3y - p0 in this article as in ref .",
    "the range parameters @xmath33 of m3y - p0 are maintained in any of @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 . as in m3y - p0 ,",
    "the longest - range part in @xmath34 is kept identical to the central channels of the one - pion exchange potential ( opep ) , @xmath37 .",
    "although the @xmath7 splitting plays a significant role in the nuclear shell structure , the @xmath6-matrix is known to underestimate the @xmath7 splitting .",
    "even though effects beyond the mfa may cure this problem  @xcite , we introduce an overall enhancement factor to @xmath35 in order to describe the shell structure within the mfa .",
    "effects of the tensor force on the single - particle ( s.p . )",
    "levels could be relevant to the new magic numbers in unstable nuclei  @xcite .",
    "we keep @xmath36 without any modification from m3y - p0 . because of this @xmath36 having realistic nature , the present m3y - type interactions are useful to investigate the tensor - force effects within the mfa and rpa , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite with the previous parameter - sets .",
    "the parameters in m3y - p6 and p7 are tabulated in table  [ tab : param_m3y ] , together with m3y - p0 .",
    ".parameters of m3y - type interactions .",
    "[ tab : param_m3y ] [ cols=\"^,^,>,<,>,<,>,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have developed new parameter - sets of the semi - realistic effective interactions to describe low energy phenomena of nuclei .",
    "they are obtained by phenomenologically modifying several parameters in the m3y - paris interaction , while the tensor force and the opep part in the central force are not changed , as before . unlike the previous parameters ,",
    "the new sets m3y - p6 and p7 are adjusted also to the microscopic ( fp and apr ) results of the neutron - matter energies and to the binding energy of @xmath0sn .",
    "we therefore attain improvement on the symmetry energy , up to its density - dependence .",
    "in contrast to instability of the spin - saturated symmetric nuclear matter in the sly5 , d1s and d1 m results , neither of m3y - p6 nor p7 predicts such phase transition in the density range of @xmath3 .",
    "the new parameter - sets m3y - p6 and p7 have been applied to the doubly magic nuclei in the spherical hf calculations , and to the proton- or neutron - magic nuclei in the spherical hfb calculations .",
    "fair agreement with experimental data has been demonstrated for the binding energies of the doubly magic nuclei and for the nucleon separation energies of the proton- or neutron - magic nuclei .",
    "owing to the realistic tensor force and the opep central force , the @xmath8- or @xmath9-dependence of the shell structure is well described with m3y - p6 and p7 , as with the previous set m3y - p5 .",
    "the isotope shifts of the pb nuclei have also been argued .",
    "future study includes application of the semi - realistic interactions to the excitations in the rpa , as well as to deformed nuclei .",
    "moreover , extensive applications to nuclear reactions and to the neutron stars may be within the reach , which give further test of the effective interactions and a step toward unified description of nuclear structure , reactions and neutron stars .",
