    "it is well established that cuprates possess a superconducting phase with an order parameter that has d - wave symmetry,@xcite and for hole - doped materials , this phase exists over a range of doping above 5% .",
    "it is also well established that at very low dopings , the material is an antiferromagetic mott insulator .",
    "connecting these two states is an unusual phase known as the pseudogap , the nature of which is still being debated.@xcite it is felt by many that the proper identification of this phase will have a major impact on the ultimate ` mechanism ' for pairing in cuprate superconductors .    angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) reveals the presence of a truncated fermi surface in the pseudogap phase.@xcite in a study of the pseudogap versus temperature,@xcite this truncated fermi surface was denoted as a ` fermi arc ' .",
    "the arc was shown to be intermediate between the d - wave node of the superconductor and the complete fermi surface of the normal state . moreover , the arc appears to form by a closing of the energy gap of the superconducting state as the temperature is raised above t@xmath0 . off the arc ,",
    "in the ` pseudogapped ' ( antinodal ) region of the brillouin zone , the spectral gap appears instead to fill in with temperature .",
    "this filling in effect is also seen in c - axis conductivity data @xcite and is consistent with the thermal evolution of the specific heat.@xcite this ` dual ' nature of the energy gap is suggestive of a ` two gap ' scenario where a ` superconducting ' gap resides on the arc and a ` pseudogap ' resides off the arc .",
    "such a two gap picture was proposed by deutscher,@xcite and recent raman,@xcite arpes,@xcite and stm @xcite data have been offered in its support . on the other hand , even for underdoped samples , the gap function below t@xmath0 seems to be more or less d - wave like.@xcite this conundrum of having a single gap below t@xmath0 transforming into a dual gap above t@xmath0 was stressed sometime ago.@xcite    recently , a very detailed temperature and doping study of the energy gap above t@xmath0 was done by kanigel _",
    "et al._@xcite they found that the length of the arc scales as t / t * , where t * , the temperature at which the spectral gap ` fills up ' in the antinodal region of the zone , strongly increases with underdoping.@xcite as a consequence , the angular anisotropy of the pseudogap looks more and more like a d - wave gap as the temperature is lowered relative to t*. this finding is supported by thermal conductivity data , which indicates that the d - wave dispersion of the superconducting state at low temperatures survives when the doping is reduced into the pseudogap state.@xcite it is also consistent with recent arpes and stm data on the stripe ordered phase of la@xmath1ba@xmath2cuo@xmath3 , which indicates a d - wave like gap anisotropy at low temperatures ( but above t@xmath0).@xcite more recently , the study of kanigel _ et al . _",
    "has been extended to below t@xmath0,@xcite where it was found that the arc collapses to a node within the resistive width of the transition , with a simple d - wave like gap below t@xmath0 .",
    "these recent studies bring into question the ` two gap ' picture .    primarily motivated by the arpes data , a wide range of models",
    "have been proposed to explain the fermi arc .",
    "basically , these models can be grouped into two categories . in the first",
    ", the pseudogap is associated with a q=0 instability .",
    "most of the models in this category have the pseudogap as a precursor to the superconducting gap , and involve pair formation with the absence of long range phase order.@xcite these models have been extended to describe the arc by explicitly invoking vortex - like excitations @xcite as revealed by measurements of the nernst effect.@xcite the node of the d - wave dispersion is broadened into an arc by a combination of lifetime broadening as well as doppler shifts of the single particle states due to the vortices .",
    "there are , though , q=0 theories which do not involve superconductivity .",
    "one example is the model of varma and zhu,@xcite which involves circulating currents within a cuo@xmath4 plaquette ( and thus has the same periodicity as the unit cell ) . in this case",
    ", the gap function has a ` d@xmath5 ' anisotropy .",
    "another example is the ` nodal nematic ' phase of kim _",
    "et al._,@xcite where the node is displaced by a nematic order parameter rather than a vortex doppler shift .",
    "the final example we mention is the model of wen and lee @xcite where the node is displaced in energy due to staggered flux phase correlations .",
    "in fact , a rich variety of behavior has been predicted within the general context of resonating valence bond ( rvb ) theories.@xcite    the second category involves a non - zero q vector .",
    "this category ranges from models based on a precursor spin density wave,@xcite charge density wave,@xcite stripes,@xcite flux phases,@xcite or orbital currents.@xcite in the case of fluctuating order,@xcite the non - zero q vector is not as obvious in the excitation spectrum .",
    "those scenarios involving a @xmath6 wavevector possess small hole pockets centered at @xmath7 where the intensity is reduced on one side of the pocket due to the amplitude factors which mix the states differing by q. related models are those where the luttinger surface ( surface of zeros of the single particle greens function ) differs from the fermi surface.@xcite in this case , the fermi surface is truncated where it crosses the luttinger surface . in a more general 2k@xmath8 context , the flat parts of the fermi surface which reside in the antinodal region of the zone can be eliminated by nesting,@xcite leaving a residual arc .    in this paper , some of these scenarios will be addressed in the context of the arpes data . in section ii ,",
    "several non - zero q scenarios , where for simplicity long range order is assumed , will be analyzed .",
    "these scenarios typically lead to ( a ) fermi arcs whose length is t independent , ( b ) deviations of the arcs from the underlying fermi surface , ( c ) energy gaps which are not centered symmetrically about the fermi energy , and ( d ) shadow bands .",
    "we argue that there is no evidence for these effects in arpes and tunneling data , at least in the mildly underdoped region . in section iii",
    ", we turn to the q=0 solutions .",
    "we find that the scenario most consistent with the data is one where the node remains along the zone diagonal and at the fermi energy .",
    "the temperature evolution of the arc above t@xmath0 is consistent with lifetime broadening of the node , though the data also indicate a distortion of the d - wave gap anisotropy with temperature . in section iv",
    ", we offer some conclusions , and suggest future arpes experiments that could further differentiate between the various models for the fermi arc .",
    "these scenarios assume a q vector of @xmath6 with an energy gap that is either isotropic , or has d - wave symmetry.@xcite the secular matrix is of 2 by 2 form , and the greens function associated with the wavevector k in the presence of simple elastic broadening , @xmath9 , can be written as : @xmath10 where @xmath11 we have looked at several cases , with various dispersions , @xmath12 , including some with bilayer splitting , and several different forms for @xmath13 . for brevity ,",
    "we present results using for @xmath12 the tight binding dispersion of norman _",
    "et al._@xcite and a d - density wave gap @xcite @xmath14 .    , and ( b ) versus energy for @xmath15 for several @xmath16 , for the d - density wave model.@xcite the black curve in ( a ) is the normal state fermi surface .",
    "zone dimensions for all figures are in @xmath17 units , and energies are in mev .",
    "for all figures ( unless otherwise noted ) , @xmath18=50 mev and @xmath9=25 mev.,width=326 ]    in fig .",
    "1a , we present the intensity plot of the spectral function ( imaginary part of @xmath19 ) in the 2d zone for @xmath20 . at the simplest level ,",
    "one indeed finds an arc .",
    "but there are several details worth pointing out .",
    "first , the ends of the arc turn away from the underlying fermi surface of the normal state .",
    "this is due to the fact that the zero energy contour traces out a pocket centered at @xmath7 , the back side of which is suppressed by the coherence factors ( the prefactor of each term in eq .  1 ) .",
    "second , there is a strong suppression of the intensity at the ` hot spots ' - the points where the normal state fermi surface ( @xmath21 ) crosses its @xmath6 displaced image .",
    "this can be related to the ` luttinger surface ' effect mentioned in the introduction . to see this",
    ", we note that the greens function in this model can be rewritten as : @xmath22 the ` gap ' self - energy ( the last term of this equation ) diverges when @xmath23 in the absence of broadening ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "thus the @xmath6 translated image of the normal state fermi surface ( @xmath25 ) is the luttinger surface , and therefore the zero energy intensity is suppressed when the normal state fermi surface crosses this surface .",
    "finally , there is weaker intensity centered around the @xmath26 points which will be suppressed as @xmath18 increases . to investigate this further , in fig .  1b",
    ", we show the spectral function for several k points along the @xmath27 direction .",
    "one clearly sees that the spectral function has a minimum value that sits at negative energy . at @xmath28 ,",
    "it is obvious from eq .",
    "2 that this minimum value occurs at @xmath29 , which is -34 mev for this dispersion .",
    "this asymmetry in energy is obviously enhanced for dispersions where @xmath30 is deeper in energy .",
    "sr@xmath4cacu@xmath4o@xmath31 ( bi2212 ) around the underlying fermi surface in the pseudogap phase ( t=140k ) divided by a resolution broadened fermi function .",
    "the bottom curve is at the node and the top curve at the antinode .",
    "the data set is the same as in fig .",

    "( b ) zero energy intensity from ( a ) as a function of the fermi surface angle , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 corresponds to the antinode and @xmath34 to the node .",
    "( c ) zero energy intensity versus @xmath35 ( the data were reflected relative to @xmath36 ) . for ( b ) , the intensities were obtained by subtracting a background edc ( obtained from an unoccupied k ) , then normalizing this subtracted intensity by its energy integrated weight .",
    "this was designed to minimize the effect of the photoemission matrix elements .",
    "this was not done in ( c ) in order to demonstrate that the raw data show no indication for any deviation of the arc from the underlying fermi surface ( black curve).,width=326 ]    in relation to the experimental data , we note the following issues with this model , which are generic to models based on a finite q order parameter . first , there is no natural way to generate an arc whose length is proportional to the temperature .",
    "second , there is no evidence from arpes for a ` turn in ' of the ends of the arc away from the underlying normal state fermi surface ( fig .",
    "third , arpes is consistent with spectral functions which either have a maximum ( arc ) or minimum ( antinodal region ) at zero energy along the underlying fermi surface .",
    "we demonstrate this in fig .",
    "2a , where data in the pseudogap phase along the underlying fermi surface is plotted .",
    "these data are the same as used to construct fig .",
    "1b of ref .  ,",
    "but instead of ` symmetrizing ' the raw data as was done there ( which implicitly assumes a maximum or minimum at zero energy ) , we divide the data by a resolution broadened fermi function .",
    "the clear maxima at zero energy along the arc , and the minima at zero energy away from the arc , are quite evident .",
    "this is consistent with tunneling data as well @xcite where the minimum in the tunneling conductance is at zero bias , even in the pseudogap phase .",
    "these scenarios @xcite are related to the ones just discussed .",
    "for discussion purposes , we look at the recently proposed model of yang , rice , and zhang.@xcite in this case , the greens function is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is just the near neighbor term of the tight binding dispersion ( @xmath13 has the same form as the d density - wave case ) . note that if @xmath12 only had a near neighbor term , then at half filling , this model would be equivalent to the d density - wave model .",
    "the similarity of these two models can be seen in fig .",
    "3 , where we show the zero energy intensity plot in the 2d zone , as well as the intensity versus @xmath39 for k along @xmath27 .",
    "again , note the pronounced suppression of the intensity at the ` hot spots ' in fig .",
    "3a , which is not evident in the data ( a plot of the experimental zero energy intensity around the fermi energy is shown in fig .",
    "2b ) , as well as the pronounced asymmetry of the energy gap relative to the fermi energy in fig .  3b . and ,",
    "as with the d density - wave model , there is no obvious mechanism to obtain an arc proportional to t.    , and ( b ) versus energy and @xmath16 for @xmath15 , for the model of yang _",
    "et al._@xcite , width=326 ]      these scenarios assume a q vector which nests the antinodal points of the 2d fermi surface .",
    "two approximations were analyzed . in the first , a single q vector along @xmath40 , @xmath41 ,",
    "was used in the first octant ( bounded by @xmath42 ) of the square lattice zone ( a 2 by 2 secular equation ) , the result of which was then reflected to the other octant .",
    "the orientation of q was designed so as to connect the antinode at @xmath43 with the one at @xmath44 .",
    "the equation for the greens function is the same as in eqs .  1 and 2 , except that @xmath13 in this case",
    "was taken to be isotropic .    in the second approximation , a 3 by 3 secular equation",
    "is separately solved for q vectors oriented respectively along @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and along @xmath40 , @xmath48 and @xmath41 , in the first quadrant of the zone , and then the two results are averaged ( representing averaging over two domains ) .",
    "the unaveraged @xmath19 is given by @xmath49 where by @xmath50 and @xmath51 we mean modulo 3 .",
    "the @xmath52 are given by solving the appropriate cubic equation and can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54    in fig .  4 , we show the zero energy intensity in the 2d zone for the two approximations .",
    "again , a clear arc is seen , with extra structure that can be attributed to the reduced intensity ( due again to the coherence factors ) of the ` shadow ' bands .",
    "this is particularly true in 4b where more shadow bands occur .",
    "a similar situation would occur if one had ` checkerboard ' order ( this would be obtained by solving a 5 by 5 secular matrix associated with a ` double q ' structure ) .     for ( a ) the 2 by 2 secular equation and ( b ) the 3 by 3 secular equation approximations , for the antinodal nesting model with @xmath55.,width=326 ]    a significant difference from the previous cases is the origin of the arc . in the previous cases ,",
    "the arc is due to the fermi energy cutting across the lower of the two energy bands .",
    "in essence , the energy gap is centered above the fermi energy for k vectors from the node to the ` hot spots ' , and it is centered below the fermi energy for k vectors from the ` hot spots ' to the antinode .",
    "but in this ` antinodal ' nesting case , it is the reverse situation . in the 2 by 2 approximation",
    ", the arc is formed from the fermi energy cutting across the upper of the two bands .",
    "this is particularly evident near the arc tip , as shown in fig .",
    "5 . in essence",
    ", the energy gap is centered below the fermi energy for k along the arc .",
    "for momenta near the arc tip , one would find a minimum in the spectral function at a negative energy ( as in fig .",
    "this effect is not evident , though , in the arpes data . and",
    "again , as the arc tip is associated with where the underlying normal state fermi surface intersects the density wave zone boundary ( in the first octant , this would correspond to @xmath56 ) , there is no natural mechanism for an arc proportional to temperature .",
    "as discussed by mcelroy,@xcite this would require a ` two gap ' scenario , where the density wave gap would wipe out the antinodal parts of the fermi surface , and then a second gap would wipe out the remaining arc with reducing temperature . despite the attractiveness of such scenarios in regards to some experimental data,@xcite a definitive signature of this density wave gap would be to observe the shadow bands evident in fig .  4 and the asymmetry of the gap relative to the fermi energy evident in fig .",
    "so far , we have found no evidence for either of these effects.@xcite     near the arc tip ( @xmath57 ) for ( a ) the 2 by 2 secular equation and ( b ) the 3 by 3 secular equation approximations , for the antinodal nesting model with @xmath55.,width=326 ]",
    "the rvb model of wen and lee @xcite is based on incorporating both the effect of a d - wave gap in the particle - particle channel and a staggered flux phase gap in the particle - hole channel .",
    "an ansatz for the greens function in this model that makes it of the same form as the earlier cases we studied is @xmath58 the effect of @xmath59 is to move the d - wave node off the fermi energy , and the sign of @xmath59 is chosen to be negative so that the node is above the fermi energy .",
    "the result is an arc at zero energy that is tied to the underlying fermi surface ( fig .",
    "this is a positive feature of this model .",
    "if @xmath60 were proportional to t for some ( unknown ) reason , this could also account for the temperature evolution of the arc .",
    "the major problem with this model , though , is that as one goes to positive energy , the arc would shrink in size , and as one goes to negative energy , the arc would expand in size .",
    "this effect is not evident in the arpes data in the pseudogap phase , though , which seems to be more or less consistent with arcs which are independent of energy up to energy scales of order @xmath18.@xcite and in this model , the energy gap is always centered at an energy above the fermi energy for all momentum cuts in the zone , an effect not visible in fig .",
    ".     for the model of wen and lee with @xmath59=-50mev.@xcite , width=326 ]      the simplest model in this class is equivalent to the one just described with @xmath61 @xmath62 the spectral function for finite @xmath9 traces out an ` arc ' , as shown in fig .",
    "7a . and the energy gap is centered at the fermi energy , as shown in fig",
    "that is , the gap is tied to the fermi energy and the fermi surface , consistent with experiment . in fig .  8a , we plot the evolution of the spectral function on the fermi surface ( @xmath21 ) for this model , and in fig",

    "8a ) are obviously controlled by the sign of the second derivative of the spectral function with respect to @xmath39 at @xmath20 .",
    "the condition that this second derivative is zero is @xmath63 . assuming a simple d - wave gap of the form @xmath64 where @xmath32 is the fermi surface angle measured relative to the antinode , one then obtains for the position of the arc tip @xmath65 .",
    "t * would then be the condition that @xmath66 .    in fig .  9a",
    ", we show the variation of the arc length with @xmath9 .",
    "this variation is consistent with experiment , as shown in fig .  9a ,",
    "if one assumes that @xmath67 and @xmath18 is a constant in @xmath68 ( similar plots are shown in refs .  ) .",
    "this linear variation of the arc length with @xmath9 is a natural consequence of the linear variation of @xmath13 with @xmath32 around the node .",
    "the upturn of the arc length at larger @xmath9 is due to the quadratic dependence of the energy gap with @xmath32 about the antinode .",
    "for a d - wave gap and a @xmath69 gap ( data from ref .  ) .",
    "( b ) experimental spectral intensity at zero energy versus fermi surface angle ( as in fig .",
    "2b ) versus fits that assume either a d - wave gap ( @xmath70 ) or a @xmath69 gap ( @xmath71 ) .",
    ", width=326 ]    the theory of varma and zhu @xcite is similar except that @xmath13 is taken to be the square of the d - wave gap .",
    "as they point out , this fits the angular anisotropy of the parameter @xmath13 in the pseudogap phase @xcite better than the simple d - wave model , as can be seen in fig .",
    "9b . on the other hand ,",
    "the arc length variation with @xmath68 is more consistent with the simple d - wave form , as shown in fig .  9a , though we remark that varma and zhu were able to obtain a much better fit to the arc length by allowing a self - energy with a more sophisticated frequency and temperature dependence.@xcite",
    "in regards to the ` non zero q ' scenarios , there are several ways that experiment could address this question .",
    "definitive evidence would be finding a departure of the arc from the underlying normal state fermi surface , evidence for an energy gap which is asymmetric in energy relative to the chemical potential , or the existence of shadow bands ( i.e. , bands displaced from the main band by the wavevector q ) .",
    "other evidence would be the existence of intensity suppression at ` hot spots ' ( where the fermi surface would cross the luttinger surface ) , as has been observed by arpes in electron doped cuprates.@xcite    in regards to the ` zero q ' scenarios , the simplest theory consistent with the data appears to be a d - wave gap with an inverse lifetime that is proportional to @xmath68 .",
    "there are , though , some limitations of this model . the data of ref .",
    "were actually fit with a form more general than that of eq .",
    "9 @xcite @xmath72 this ` two lifetime ' model has the advantage of being able to describe a broad spectral function ( @xmath73 ) but with a sharp leading edge gap ( @xmath74 ) as indicated by arpes data in the pseudogap phase.@xcite it has since been extended to include a more general frequency dependence for the self - energy.@xcite the presence of two lifetimes may seem unusual , as this does not occur , for instance , in the standard eliashberg treatment of strong coupling superconductors.@xcite the motivation in ref .   was that @xmath73 denotes the interaction in the particle - hole channel , whereas @xmath74 denotes that in the particle - particle channel . if the dispersion of the single particle states is ignored , a calculation of fermions interacting with pair fluctuations leads to @xmath74 proportional to @xmath75.@xcite in contrast , in two dimensions , a dependence proportional to @xmath76 is obtained.@xcite consideration of vortex excitations @xcite leads instead to linear @xmath68 behavior at high @xmath68 . in general , one would expect linear @xmath68 behavior at high temperatures , since this occurs for any model of fermions interacting with bosons,@xcite but with a collapse to zero at @xmath77 since the inverse pair lifetime should vanish in the ordered state .",
    "this general @xmath68 dependence not only naturally describes the linear @xmath68 variation of the arc length,@xcite it can also account for the ` filling up ' of the gap in the antinodal region.@xcite it also explains why the arc length collapses to zero within the resistive width of the transition.@xcite regardless , our experience has been that two lifetimes are necessary to properly model the data.@xcite a complete description of modeling based on eq .",
    "10 in regards to the arpes data is beyond the scope of the present paper and will be left for a future study .",
    "the fits presented in ref",
    ".   also indicated that the gap anisotropy changed with temperature , and that this effect could not be described by lifetime broadening of the zero temperature gap , though it should be remarked that the actual value of @xmath13 is difficult to extract once the broadening significantly exceeds @xmath13 .",
    "whether such changes in anisotropy ( and in particular , a region around the node where @xmath13 is identically zero as indicated by these fits ) can be described by pair breaking within a strong - coupling eliashberg context remains to be seen .",
    "certainly , careful measurements of the gap anisotropy at different temperatures and dopings would help to better differentiate models based on a d - wave gap from more novel ones , such as that of varma and zhu,@xcite that have a fundamentally different gap anisotropy .    in conclusion ,",
    "we believe that a model of a d - wave gap with a temperature dependent lifetime consistent with fluctuating pairs gives the simplest description of arpes data in the pseudogap phase . future experimental work should be aimed at further differentiating between various proposed models for the fermi arc , as well as using this information to address other data , such as transport .",
