    "the problem of finding the radical ideal @xmath14 seems to be much better understood than that of finding the real radical ideal @xmath1 ; see below for a brief recap on existing literature . in this paper",
    ", we provide a new characterization of the real radical ideal @xmath1 of an ideal @xmath17 $ ] , assuming @xmath2 is given by generators @xmath18}$ ] and @xmath3 is finite ( while @xmath19 needs not be finite ) .",
    "in addition , from this characterization , we also define a numerical algorithm based on semidefinite programming to compute the points of the ( finite ) variety @xmath3 as well as a set of generators of the real radical ideal @xmath1 . more generally , our results extend to the case of the so - called @xmath20-radical ideal @xmath21 where @xmath22 is defined by finitely many polynomial inequalities , assuming that @xmath23 is finite .",
    "it turns out that a similar algorithm also works for computing @xmath24 and the radical ideal @xmath25 ( assuming now @xmath24 finite ) although very good methods already exist for this latter case . in the remainder of the introduction , after recalling some motivation and related literature on the problem of finding the ( real ) radical ideal , we sketch the main ingredients of our method .",
    "we already introduce some definitions but refer to sections [ secprelideal ] and [ secprelmom ] for additional definitions about polynomials and moment matrices .    * _ motivation .",

    "indeed , to the best of our knowledge , most basic methods for computing the real variety @xmath3 first compute the complex variety @xmath24 ; for this they require as basic ingredients a grbner basis of @xmath2 and a linear basis of the vector space @xmath26/i$ ] and thus they work under the assumption that @xmath24 is finite . even if @xmath24 is finite but has many more complex elements than real ones",
    ", this may produce a large computational overhead .",
    "this is particularly important as the numbers of complex and real solutions may differ significantly as supported by the fewnomial theory of khovanski @xcite ; see also the discussion in bihan et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . in other words , this problem of real algebraic geometry is solved via algebraic methods that do not take into account right from the beginning the real algebraic aspect of the problem .",
    "in contrast , our characterization and our algorithm do not need knowledge of a grbner basis of @xmath2 and are real algebraic in nature , as we never compute any complex zero .    *",

    "* there is a large literature on the problem of finding the radical ideal @xmath15 of an ideal @xmath2 ; see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . for",
    "the general ( positive - dimensional ) case , krick and logar @xcite propose an efficient algorithm based on splitting and reduction to the zero - dimensional case , which is implemented e.g. in the computer algebra package singular @xcite .",
    "in the zero - dimensional case the problem is considered to be well - solved , e.g. , via the following method of seidenberg  @xcite : @xmath27 , the ideal generated by @xmath2 and the @xmath28 s , where @xmath28 is the square - free part of the monic generator @xmath29 of @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "finding @xmath29 is easy once a linear basis @xmath31 of @xmath4}/i$ ] is known .",
    "namely , find the smallest integer @xmath32 for which @xmath33 is linearly dependent in @xmath4}/i$ ] ; then this smallest linear dependence gives the polynomial @xmath29 .",
    "next , the polynomial @xmath28 can be found taking derivatives and gcd - computations as @xmath34 .",
    "so finding @xmath25 is easy if we have a basis of @xmath4}/i$ ] .",
    "a classical method for finding such a basis @xmath31 is to compute a grbner basis of @xmath2 and the corresponding set @xmath31 of standard monomials .",
    "the results in the present paper show that one may alternatively find such a basis @xmath31 from a suitable moment matrix .    on the other hand , the problem of computing the real radical ideal is considered to be much more difficult .",
    "for instance , in their paper which is one of the first classical references on this problem , becker and neuhaus @xcite write that _ the computation of @xmath35-real parts _ ( thus , the real radical ideal ) _ is much more difficult _ ( than that of the ordinary radical ) .",

    "finally , let us mention that excellent algorithms and software packages exist for computing the complex variety @xmath24 of a zero - dimensional ideal @xmath2 , e.g. , by verschelde @xcite , rouillier @xcite ; see also related work by mourrain et al .",
    "@xcite and e.g. the monograph @xcite . for instance , verschelde @xcite proposes symbolic - numeric algorithms via homotopy continuation methods ( cf . also @xcite ) whereas rouillier @xcite solves a zero - dimensional system of polynomials by giving a rational univariate representation ( rur ) for its solutions , of the form @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 $ ] are univariate polynomials .",
    "the computation of the rur relies in an essential way on the multiplication matrices in the quotient algebra @xmath4}/i$ ] which thus requires the knowledge of a corresponding linear basis .",
    "* _ our contribution .",
    "_ * given an ideal @xmath42 $ ] ( @xmath43 ) defined by a set of generators and satisfying @xmath44 , we provide a method for computing @xmath45 as well as a border basis and a grbner basis of the ideal @xmath46 .",
    "our approach is based on a semidefinite programming characterization of @xmath46 with the following distinguished feature .",
    "remarkably , all information needed to compute the above objects is contained in the so - called moment matrix ( whose entries depend on the polynomials generating the ideal @xmath2 ) and the geometry behind it when this matrix is required to be positive semidefinite with maximum rank .",
    "the latter property is achieved by standard semidefinite programming algorithms .",
    "for the task of computing the real roots and the real radical ideal @xmath1 , the method is real algebraic in nature , as we do not compute ( implicitly or explicitly ) any complex element of @xmath24 .",
    "lasserre @xcite already recognized that moment matrices can be used for approximating the minimum of a polynomial over a basic closed semi - algebraic set and sometimes extracting global minimizers ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . the present paper builds on this approach and shows how it can be applied to finding the real radical of a zero - dimensional ideal .",
    "moreover there are links between moment matrices and the hermite quadratic forms used in @xcite for computing the number of real roots , that were pointed out in @xcite .",
    "our approach with its specificity is best illustrated on the task of computing the real radical ideal @xmath1 that we now briefly describe .    given a sequence @xmath47 ,",
    "consider the _ moment matrix _",
    "@xmath48 ( later we will also introduce complex moment matrices @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) .",
    "one may think that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are indexed by the set @xmath53 of monomials .",

    "let us say that @xmath57 lies in the kernel of @xmath52 when @xmath58 does , which enables us to view @xmath59 as a subset of @xmath60}$ ] .",

    "( in ( [ prop0 ] ) the notation `` @xmath67 '' stands for positive semidefinite . )",
    "this semidefinite characterization leads directly to an algorithm for computing @xmath1 , by considering _",
    "truncated _ moment matrices in place of the full ( infinite ) moment matrix @xmath52 .",
    "namely , given an integer @xmath68 , let @xmath69 denote the principal submatrix of @xmath52 whose rows and columns are indexed by the set @xmath70 and set @xmath71 fix @xmath72 and assume @xmath69 is a maximum rank matrix satisfying @xmath73 we will show that if , moreover , @xmath74 for some @xmath75 , then @xmath1 coincides with the ideal generated by @xmath76 .",
    "the same conclusion holds if @xmath77 for some @xmath78 .",
    "moreover , from the semidefinite characterizations ( [ mat0])-([rank1 ] ) , the following algebraic objects can be obtained directly from the matrix @xmath69 :    ( i ) : :    let @xmath79 be a set    indexing a maximum nonsingular principal submatrix of    @xmath80 . then @xmath31 is a    linear basis of the quotient vector space    @xmath60}/i(v_{\\mathbb r}(i))$ ] ( see section    [ secflat ] ) .",

    "( iii ) : :    when the set @xmath31 ( as in ( i ) ) is an order ideal    ( i.e. , is stable under division ) , the matrices of the multiplication    operators by @xmath81 give directly a border basis    of the ideal @xmath1 ( see section    [ secborder ] ) .",
    "( iv ) : :    given a graded lexicographic monomial ordering , we can find a set    @xmath31 ( as in ( i ) ) which is precisely the set of    standard monomials ; the associated reduced grbner basis of    @xmath1 can then be recovered , since it is    contained in the border basis .",
    "in fact our method also applies to an    arbitrary monomial ordering ( see section [ secgrobner ] ) .",
    "( v ) : :    finally the method can also detect whether the real variety    @xmath3 is empty .",

    "( see remark [ remdetect ] . )    * _ further discussion .",
    "_ * an independence oracle in @xmath60}/i(v_{\\mathbb r}(i))$ ] is needed for our algorithm in ( iv ) above .",

    "( iv ) , a grbner basis can easily be derived _ afterwards _ in contrast with classical methods which compute the set of standard monomials from the grbner basis .    realizing the above tasks relies only on numerical linear algebraic operations on @xmath69 like evaluating the rank of certain principal submatrices .",
    "finding a matrix satisfying ( [ mat0 ] ) is an instance of semidefinite programming .",
    "moreover , it is a property of most interior - point algorithms for semidefinite programming that they do find such a matrix having maximum rank ( see section  [ rem::sdp ] for details ) .",
    "the method is iterative .",
    "namely , if the maximum rank matrix satisfying ( [ mat0 ] ) does not satisfy ( [ rankd ] ) or ( [ rank1 ] ) , then we iterate with @xmath86 in place of @xmath68 .",
    "the method eventually terminates since we will show that ( [ rankd ] ) holds for @xmath68 large enough .",
    "the following two small examples illustrate",
    "how positive semidefiniteness of the matrix @xmath69 allows the elimination of all complex ( nonreal ) roots , whose number can be much larger than the number of real roots or even infinite .",

    "one may argue that the ideal @xmath2 is already described by a grbner basis .",
    "but the same conclusion also holds under the change of variables @xmath106 with @xmath107 being a nonsingular matrix , in which case other methods would require a grbner basis computation .",
    "[ ex2 ] let @xmath108 $ ] be generated by @xmath109 .",

    "hence the maximum rank of @xmath115 is equal to 1 and @xmath105 is spanned by @xmath116 , the generators of @xmath1 .",
    "the method sometimes ( partially ) applies even if none of the rank conditions ( [ rankd ] ) , ( [ rank1 ] ) holds , namely when @xmath69 contains sufficient information for the construction of the ( formal ) multiplication matrices .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath69 be a maximum rank matrix satisfying ( [ mat0 ] ) , let @xmath117 index a maximum nonsingular principal submatrix of @xmath69 , set @xmath118 , and assume that the two principal submatrices of @xmath69 indexed by @xmath31 and by @xmath119 have the same rank .",
    "then , by the results of kehrein , kreuzer and robbiano  ( * ? ? ?",

    "it turns out that , for most examples we have tested , @xmath124 holds and we are again able to find @xmath125 together with a border basis generating this ideal .",

    "in the sequel of this section we give more details about these different tasks .",
    "this first task can be cast as the problem of finding a feasible solution of a semidefinite program , that has maximum rank . for details on the theory and applications of semidefinite programming the interested reader",
    "is referred , e.g. , to @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is a known geometric property of semidefinite programs that a feasible solution has maximum rank if and only if it lies in the relative interior of the feasible region and that such point can be found with interior - point algorithms using self - dual embedding ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let us give some details .",
    "consider a general instance of semidefinite program @xmath915 and its dual semidefinite program @xmath916 here , @xmath917 are hermitian matrices , @xmath918 , @xmath919 , @xmath51 are the variables . obviously , @xmath920 ( weak duality ) .",
    "there is no duality gap ( i.e. , @xmath921 ) , e.g. , when ( [ p ] ) is strictly feasible ( i.e. , @xmath922 with @xmath923 ) or when ( [ d ] ) is strictly feasible ( i.e. , @xmath924 feasible for ( [ d ] ) ) .",
    "when ( [ d ] ) is strictly feasible and @xmath925 , then ( [ p ] ) attains its minimum , i.e. , the set of optimal solutions is nonempty .",
    "the feasible region to ( [ p ] ) is the convex set @xmath926 therefore , for @xmath927 , @xmath51 lies in the relative interior of @xmath928 if and only if @xmath929 for all @xmath930 or , equivalently , if @xmath931 has maximum possible rank ( same argument as for lemma  [ lemkerr ] ) .",
    "semidefinite programs can be solved in polynomial time to an arbitrary precision using , e.g. , the ellipsoid method , whose running time is however prohibitively high in practice .",
    "interior - point methods are now the method of choice for solving semidefinite programs . assuming strict feasibility of ( [ p ] ) and ( [ d ] ) , interior - point algorithms construct sequences of points on the so - called central path , which has the property of converging to an optimum solution of maximum rank @xcite .",
    "one can also find a maximum rank optimum solution under the weaker assumption that ( [ p ] ) , ( [ d ] ) are feasible ( but not necessarily strictly feasible ) , if @xmath932 is attained , and @xmath933 .",
    "indeed one can then construct the so - called extended self - dual embedding which is a strictly feasible semidefinite program with the property that a maximum rank optimum solution to it yields a maximum rank optimum solution to the original problem ( [ p ] ) ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  4 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  5 ) ) .    for our problem of finding @xmath811 maximizing @xmath934 , consider the semidefinite program @xmath935 where we add the condition ( [ relher ] ) in the complex case .",
    "one can interpret ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) the dual of ( [ p0 ] ) as @xmath936 where ` @xmath333 is s.o.s . '",
    "means that @xmath333 can be written as a sum of squares , i.e. , @xmath937 for some polynomials @xmath938}$ ] or @xmath599 $ ] .",
    "obviously , ( [ p0 ] ) is feasible if @xmath939 .",
    "moreover , ( [ d0 ] ) is feasible ( e.g. with @xmath940 , @xmath941 as feasible solution ) and , if @xmath942 , then @xmath943 is attained by the whole set @xmath905 and @xmath944 .",
    "hence an interior - point algorithm implementing the self - dual embedding technique applied to problem ( [ p0 ] ) is guaranteed to return the following information ) is infeasible , since any @xmath811 together with the solution @xmath940 , @xmath941 to ( [ d0 ] ) makes a complementary pair . ] : either ( i ) @xmath811 maximizing @xmath934 , or ( ii ) a certificate that ( [ p0 ] ) is infeasible thus implying @xmath945 . for our computations",
    "we use the semidefinite programming solver sedumi-1.05 @xcite which has this feature .",
    "practically , this means that the solution returned by the algorithm is very close to a maximum rank optimum solution .",
    "when using a semidefinite programming solver without the maximum rank property , one can recover a maximum rank solution to ( [ p0 ] ) from a feasible solution @xmath946 to ( [ p0 ] ) , using the following simple iterative algorithm .",
    "let @xmath947 be a set of vectors that span @xmath948 , set @xmath949 , and consider the semidefinite program : @xmath950 subject to @xmath51 satisfying the constraints of ( [ p0 ] ) .",
    "if the optimum value is equal to 0 , then @xmath946 is in fact a solution of maximum rank .",
    "otherwise , let @xmath951 be the optimum solution returned by the solver ; then @xmath952 .",
    "then , @xmath953 is feasible for ( [ p0 ] ) and @xmath954 .",
    "hence we have found a feasible solution @xmath955 to ( [ p0 ] ) for which the rank of @xmath956 is larger than that @xmath957 .",

    "once a maximum rank matrix @xmath906 is found , one has to check if for some @xmath656 the conditions of proposition [ propborder ] ( i)-(iii ) hold , or if ( [ flati ] ) ( resp . ( [ flatic ] ) ) holds , or if ( [ flatii ] ) ( resp . ( [ flatiic ] ) ) holds",

    "the choice of this basis will have an influence on the numerical stability of the extracted set @xmath121 of solutions and on the properties of the basis for @xmath361 as well .",

    "the diagonal entries of @xmath965 are the singular values of @xmath962 ( i.e. , the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath966 ) ; the number of nonzero diagonal entries of @xmath965 is thus equal to @xmath967 .",
    "then the set @xmath968 of columns of @xmath969 corresponding to the nonzero diagonal entries of @xmath965 forms an orthonormal basis of the column space of @xmath962 . as we already did perform a svd to determine the rank of the matrix @xmath970",
