    "in the next generation of @xmath8 colliders , multiple vector - boson production will provide a crucial test of the gauge structure of the standard model ( sm ) , since it will allow the study of the triple and quartic vector - boson couplings .",
    "these vertices are strictly constrained by the @xmath9 gauge invariance and any small deviation from the sm predictions spoils the precise cancellation of the high - energy behavior between the various diagrams , giving rise to an anomalous growth of the cross section with energy .",
    "therefore , the careful study of multiple vector - boson production , and consequently of vector - boson self - interactions , can give important clues about the existence of new particles and/or interactions beyond the sm .",
    "the reaction @xmath10 will be accessible at lep ii and some information about the @xmath11 and @xmath12 vertices will be available in the near future @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will have to wait for colliders with higher center  of  mass energies in order to produce a final state with three or more gauge bosons and to test the quartic gauge  boson interaction .",
    "this will be accomplished at the next linear @xmath3 collider ( nlc ) @xcite , which will reach an energy between 500 and 2000 gev with an yearly integrated luminosity of at least @xmath13 fb@xmath14 .",
    "an interesting feature of these new machines is the possibility of transforming an electron beam into a photon one through the laser backscattering mechanism @xcite .",
    "this process will allow the nlc to operate in three different modes , @xmath3 , @xmath15 , and @xmath4 , opening up the opportunity for a wider search for new physics .",
    "however , it is important to point out that the collider can operate in only one of its three modes at a given time , therefore , it is essential to study comparatively the different features of each of these setups .    the triple and quartic gauge ",
    "boson vertices , in the framework of gauge theories , have a common origin , and consequently , a universal strength dictated by the gauge symmetry of the model .",
    "notwithstanding , in a more general context , anomalous quartic couplings can arise as the low  energy limit of heavy state exchange , whereas trilinear couplings are modified by integrating out heavy fields . in this sense , it is possible to conceive extensions of the sm where the trilinear couplings remain unchanged , while the quartic vertices receive new contributions .",
    "for instance , the introduction of a new heavy scalar singlet , that interacts strongly with the higgs sector of the sm , enhances the four vector - boson interaction without affecting either the triple vector - boson couplings or the sm predictions for the @xmath16 parameter @xcite .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the three  vector",
    " boson production cross section can provide further non  trivial tests of the sm that are complementary to the analysis of the production of vector  boson pairs .",
    "the cross section for the production of multiple gauge bosons , in the context of the sm , has already been evaluated for @xmath3 colliders operating in the @xmath8 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , and @xmath4 @xcite modes .",
    "there has also been some studies of anomalous quartic vertices through the reactions @xmath17 @xcite , @xmath18 @xcite , and @xmath19 @xcite , where @xmath20 @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath7 and @xmath23 @xmath24 or @xmath25 . in this work ,",
    "we analyze the effect of some genuinely anomalous quartic operators , _",
    "i.e. _ operators which do not modify the trilinear vertices and can not be bounded by the lep ii measurements . furthermore , since we are interested in probing these anomalous couplings in a @xmath26 collider , we concentrate our analyses on operators that involve at least one photon .",
    "we studied the production of three vector bosons in @xmath4 collisions through the reactions @xmath27 @xmath28 in order to impose bounds on the vertices @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 .",
    "these processes involve only interactions between the gauge bosons , making more evident any deviation from the sm predictions .",
    "moreover , there is no tree ",
    "level contribution involving the higgs boson which evades all the uncertainties coming from the scalar sector , like the higgs boson mass .",
    "our results show that the constraint on the anomalous couplings @xmath29 , coming from the reaction [ z ] , is as restrictive as the one obtained in @xmath15 colliders @xcite and a factor of 5 better than the one coming from @xmath3 colliders @xcite . on the other hand , the bounds in the vertices @xmath30 and",
    "@xmath32 , stemming from the processes [ g ] and [ z ] , are a factor from 2 to 5 better than the ones that can be obtained in an @xmath33 collider , however , they are worse than the ones coming from the direct reaction @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "the next section contains the effective operators that we analyzed and the calculational method employed in this paper .",
    "our results and discussions are presented in sec .",
    "in order to construct effective operators associated to exclusively quartic anomalous couplings we employed the formalism of ref .  @xcite .",
    "we required the existence of a custodial @xmath35 symmetry , which avoids any contribution to the @xmath16 parameter , and we also demanded that the phenomenological lagrangians are invariant under local @xmath36 symmetry .",
    "the lowest order operators that comply with the above requirements , involving at least one photon , are of dimension six @xcite : there are two independent @xmath37 and @xmath38 conserving operators involving two photons @xcite @xmath39 and one operator exhibiting just one photon @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the @xmath35 triplet and @xmath42 is the electromagnetic field strength . in terms of the physical fields @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath21 , the effective lagrangians ( [ lag:0 ] ) and ( [ lag : c ] ) give rise to anomalous @xmath1 and @xmath2 couplings , while ( [ lag : new ] ) generates a new @xmath45 vertex .",
    "we should notice that the @xmath2 vertex is particularly interesting since it is completely absent in the sm .",
    "moreover , we note that the effective operators ( [ lag:0 ] ) and ( [ lag : new ] ) can parametrize the exchange of a neutral scalar particle while the operator ( [ lag : c ] ) corresponds to the exchange of a charged particle .",
    "therefore , we expect that the characteristic scale of the above interactions is set by the masses of the exchanged states . in the limit of very heavy scalars ,",
    "the expected values of the coefficients @xmath46 ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 ) should be in the range of @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "for the sake of definiteness , our results are presented assuming that @xmath52",
    ".    an interesting feature of the above effective lagrangians is that they will not be directly constrained by lep ii since they do not contribute to triple gauge  boson vertices . in order to obtain some bounds on these couplings at low energies",
    ", we must rely on their contribution to one - loop processes . from the analysis of oblique radiative corrections to the @xmath21 physics @xcite",
    ", we estimated that @xmath53 and @xmath54 at @xmath55 level , while the coupling @xmath56 is not constrained at all .    in order to evaluate the triple  vector  boson production at nlc",
    ", we assumed that this machine will reach a center  of  mass energy of @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) gev with a yearly integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath14 .",
    "the most promising mechanism to generate hard photon beams in an @xmath8 linear collider is laser backscattering .",
    "assuming unpolarized electron and laser beams , the backscattered photon distribution function @xcite is @xmath59 \\ ; , \\label{f : l}\\ ] ] with @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the compton cross section , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 are the electron mass and energy respectively , and @xmath65 is the laser - photon energy .",
    "the quantity @xmath66 represents the ratio between the scattered photon and initial electron energy and its maximum value is @xmath67 in what follows , we assumed that the laser frequency is such that @xmath68 , which leads to the hardest possible spectrum of photons with a large luminosity .",
    "the cross section for the triple  vector  boson production via @xmath4 fusion can be obtained by folding the elementary cross section for the subprocesses @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) with the photon - photon luminosity ( @xmath71 ) , _ i.e. _ , @xmath72 where @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) is the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) center - of - mass energy , @xmath75 , and the photon - photon luminosity is @xmath76    the analytical calculation of the cross section for the subprocess @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) is very lengthy and tedious despite being straightforward . in order to perform these calculations in an efficient and reliable way",
    ", we evaluated numerically the helicity amplitudes using the techniques outlined in ref .",
    "the phase space integrations were performed numerically using the monte carlo routine vegas @xcite . as a check of our results",
    ", we explicitly verified that the amplitudes were lorentz and @xmath36 invariant and that the kinematic distributions for @xmath43 and @xmath44 coincided .",
    "the total cross sections for the processes [ g ] and [ z ] are quadratic functions of the anomalous couplings @xmath46 , _ i.e. _ @xmath79 where @xmath80 stands for the sm cross section @xcite and @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) is the interference ( pure anomalous ) contribution .",
    "we evaluated the cross sections involved in eq.([base ] ) , imposing that the polar angles of the produced vector bosons with the beam pipe are larger than @xmath83 and assuming @xmath84 . for the process [ g ]",
    ", we also introduced a cut on the photon transverse momentum , @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) gev , not only to guarantee that our results are free of infrared divergences but also to mimic the performance of a typical electromagnetic calorimeter . in table",
    "[ sigmas : z ] , we present our results assuming in each case that only one anomalous coupling is nonvanishing .    in order to quantify the effect of the new couplings , we defined the statistical significance @xmath87 of the anomalous signal @xmath88 which can be easily evaluated using the parametrization ( [ base ] ) with the coefficients given in table [ sigmas : z ] .",
    "we list in table [ const ] the values of the anomalous couplings that correspond to a @xmath89 effect in the total cross section for the different processes , assuming an integrated luminosity @xmath90 fb@xmath14 for the correspondent @xmath3 collider .",
    "it is interesting to point out that the most restringent bounds come from the process [ g ] and that our results are quite insensitive to different choices of the angular and @xmath91 cuts , as we can learn from table [ const ] .",
    "we can see from table [ const ] that our @xmath89 limits for the coupling @xmath56 are a factor of @xmath92 better than the limits obtained in @xmath3 collisions @xcite , while they are of the same order of the ones originating from an @xmath15 machine @xcite .",
    "the @xmath4 mode of the nlc is more efficient for studying this anomalous quartic coupling since it leads to cross sections for the production of three vector bosons that is more than one order of magnitude larger than the ones for a conventional @xmath3 collider with @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the limits on the anomalous coupling @xmath94 that can be established through the triple gauge  boson production are one order of magnitude better than the ones coming from the @xmath8 mode and are comparable to the constraints that can be obtained in the @xmath15 mode .",
    "however , the bounds shown in table [ const ] are a factor of 2 weaker than the ones obtained from the direct reaction @xmath34 ( @xmath95 ) , since the triple gauge  boson production is a higher order process in @xmath96 .",
    "our limits on the coupling @xmath97 are slightly better than the ones arising from the @xmath8 mode , while they are almost one order of magnitude worse than the ones obtained in @xmath15 @xcite or direct @xmath98 ( @xmath95 ) @xcite collisions .",
    "the kinematical distributions of the final state particles can be used , at least in principle , to increase the sensitivity of the @xmath4 reactions to the anomalous couplings , improving consequently the bounds on the new interactions .",
    "more than that , they could furnish further information that would allow us to distinguish among the different anomalous interactions . in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] to [ fig:4 ] , we exhibit some representative distributions for the processes [ g ] and [ z ] , adopting the values of the anomalous coupling constants that lead to a @xmath89 deviation in the total cross section .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the normalized @xmath99 distribution for the production of @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is polar angle of the vector boson with respect to the beam pipe . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the anomalous @xmath102 distributions differ from the sm one .",
    "for instance , we can identify the cases with negative values of @xmath97 and @xmath94 , but we can not discriminate between the positive values of these anomalous couplings .",
    "moreover , it is interesting to notice that the anomalous couplings enhance the production of @xmath22 in the central region of the detector , where they can be more easily reconstructed .",
    "figure [ fig:2 ] contains the normalized distribution for the invariant mass ( @xmath103 ) of vector  boson pairs @xmath104 for the process [ g ] . here",
    "we can observe that the presence of the anomalous interactions increases the invariant mass of the @xmath104 pairs since the new couplings are proportional to the photon momentum .",
    "furthermore , this distribution allows us to separate the negative @xmath97 and @xmath94 couplings , while the positive values of the anomalous couplings lead to distributions similar to the sm ones .",
    "we notice in our analyses that the distributions involving photons are less sensitive to the anomalous couplings than the @xmath22 ones .",
    "although the process @xmath105 has a lower sensitivity , when compared with the @xmath100 production , it exhibits some interesting features , as can be seen from figs.[fig:3 ] and [ fig:4 ] .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] the normalized @xmath21 transverse momentum distributions for the process [ z ] using the @xmath97 , @xmath94 , and @xmath56 anomalous couplings .",
    "we can learn from this figure that the anomalous couplings favor the @xmath21 s to have a higher @xmath106 since the momentum dependence of the anomalous vertices enhances their contribution at higher energies .",
    "once again , we can distinguish between the different anomalous interactions provided the couplings @xmath97 and @xmath94 are negative , since these couplings lead to larger purely anomalous contributions .",
    "it is interesting to remark that our analyses show that the @xmath107 distribution does not allow us to separate clearly the different anomalous interactions .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , we show the @xmath22 rapidity distributions for the process [ z ] .",
    "the anomalous interactions lead to a more copious production of @xmath22 in the central region and it is also possible to have an indication of which effective interaction is responsible for the departure from the sm predictions .",
    "we found out that , as happened in @xmath100 process , it is not possible to distinguish between the anomalous interactions through the rapidity distribution of the neutral vector bosons .",
    "the bottom line of this work is that the study of the production of @xmath100 and @xmath108 in a @xmath4 collider will be able to increase the potential of @xmath3 machines to search for anomalous four  gauge  boson interactions .",
    "furthermore , the kinematical distributions of the final state particle can also help to distinguish between some of these interactions .",
    "we collect in this appendix the expressions for anomalous contributions to the the amplitudes of the processes @xmath5 , with @xmath6 or @xmath7 .",
    "the standard model expressions can be found in ref .",
    "the momenta and polarizations of the initial photons were denoted by ( @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) and [ @xmath111 , @xmath112 , while the momenta and polarizations of the final state @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath113 are given by ( @xmath114 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 ) and [ @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 respectively .",
