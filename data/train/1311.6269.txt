    "nickel chromite has recently received considerable interest because of its classification into dynamically spin frustrated systems , based upon the realization of resonance like magnetic excitation observed in neutron scattering experiment @xcite . however , despite the presence of pyrochlore lattice which is formed by @xmath12 ion , the occurrence of jahn - teller distortion nullify the possibility of @xmath0 to be considered as geometrically frustrated magnet .",
    "a number of potential application ( light or heat sensitive micromechanical device , catalytic materials , gas sensors ) has provided technological recognition to this material @xcite .",
    "single crystals of @xmath0 has been extensively studied from the perspective of neutron scattering @xcite , heat capacity @xcite , magnetodielectric @xcite and magnetic @xcite measurements .",
    "however , magnetic studies of nanoparticles of this compound have not been reported so far . below a critical physical dimension ( in nanometer range )",
    "magnetic nanoparticles become single domain as compared to the normal multi - domain structure of the bulk counterpart .",
    "these single domain nanoparticle are quite interesting owing to unusual phenomenon they exhibit like superparamagnetism @xcite , quantum tunnelling of magnetization @xcite and large coercivities @xcite .",
    "the magnetic studies investigated have shown the occurrence of two transition temperatures @xmath13 and @xmath14 , corresponding to the onset of ferrimagnetic ( longitudinal ) component and spiral ( transverse ) antiferromagnetic component .",

    "the decrease in magnetization values in the magnetic nanoparticle system in comparison with its bulk phase is well known but still the subject matter of debate .",
    "this could be seen in the present study .",
    "the reason for this reduction in magnetization could be associated with canted spin arrangement or spin disorder on the surface or finite size effect @xcite .",
    "the result of these phenomenon leads to superparamagnetism or spin - glass phases .",

    "@xmath0 bulk was prepared by decomposition of @xmath0 obtained by reacting @xmath16 with @xmath17 . in a typical preparation ,",

    "the bulk powder sample was kept in an 80 ml agate bowl with 10 mm agate ball in 1 : 8 sample and ball weight ratio and milled up to different milling time .",
    "all the nano size samples were annealed at 400c for 4 hours and cooled very slowly to room temperature ( 40c / h ) to reduce the possible existing strain in the nano size sample .",
    "the phase purity and crystal structure ( from 320 k to 10 k ) of all the powder samples were studied by using rigaku s smartlab x - ray diffractometer using cu k lines in parallel beam geometry mode .    the x - ray diffraction",

    "these low temperature measurements were performed at osaka , japan .",

    "[ fig1 ] can be seen as an indication of cubic tetragonal structure and is because of jahn - teller distortion .",

    "the dominant peak at nearly 36 [ ( 211)d plane ] is taken under consideration for particle size determination using standard debye - scherrer equation .",
    "the average particle size of 33h and 75h ball milled samples was 14.5 and 22.15 nm respectively . to confirm these particle sizes ,",
    "the 75h sample were subjected to tem study as shown in fig .",
    "distinctly visible lattice fringes confirms the high quality of the sample as is usually observed in single crystalline nanostructures .",
    "fc - zfc measurement of bulk and nanoparticle samples were performed at different applied magnetic field ( 0.005 , 0.01 , 0.1 and 2 t ) . for",
    "0.005 t applied magnetic field , in case of bulk sample , the observed transitions at 67k and 29k corresponding to @xmath20 and @xmath21 is well reproducible and is close to the reported results in this system @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "we have zeroed the magnetic field of the superconducting magnet of mpms by following a standard zeroing protocol to ensure that the field was zero at the time of cooling .",
    "interestingly , the zfc measurement at 0.005 t of this system has shown a new transition at 90k ( named as @xmath22 here ) as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "zfc measurement at 0.005 t has not been reported so far in the literature for this system .",
    "we argue that there is development of a weak magnetic phase in the system at this transition temperature , however , the real nature of interaction might be more complex .",
    "study performed by ishibashi et .",
    "al . , has shown that the high temperature magnetic transition is occurring simultaneously with the structural transition from tetragonal to orthorhombic at @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the temperature dependent xrd measurement ( not shown here ) performed over bulk sample did not revealed any structural transition happening at 90k .",
    "hence , we verified that this new transition at @xmath22 is solely magnetic .",
    "the variation of temperature dependent magnetic behaviour at 0.005 t applied magnetic field for all the samples is shown in fig .",
    "the decrease in magnetization at @xmath20 is observed , with decrease in particle size .",
    "this softening of @xmath20 indicates the breaking of spin - lattice coupling owing to particle size reduction .",
    "the presence of spin - lattice coupling is common among chromium based spinels .",
    "the weakening of spin - lattice coupling is also supported by a shift in of spiral afm ordering at @xmath21 in our samples towards lower temperature , as the particle size decreases and can be seen in the insets of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] @xcite .",
    "the decrease in particle size destroys the long range afm correlation , resulting in a shift in @xmath14 towards lower temperatures @xcite . as the particle size decreases , a reduction in the magnetization value is observed .",
    "lowering of magnetization can be explained through increased surface spin canting , spin disorder or finite size effect at nanoparticle surface @xcite .",
    "all the samples were also investigated at 0.01 t magnetic field as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1k ] . apart from increase in magnetization value no significant effect of magnetic field is observed .",
    "however , the new transition @xmath1 could not be observed distinctly .",
    "this could be due to the formation of ferrimagnetic spin clusters which is overcome by the application of higher fields causing a disappearance of @xmath1 at higher fields .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath1 is clearly visible in the nanoparticle samples .",
    "the exchange coupling between magnetic ions ( @xmath23 and @xmath12 ) is directly proportional to curie - weiss temperature ( @xmath24 ) and can be expressed by relation ,        @xmath25    where , @xmath26 , @xmath27 is the boltzmann constant , z is the number of nearest neighbour interaction and s is the total spin .",
    "the high temperature region ( @xmath28 ) of zfc magnetization data at 0.005 and 0.01 t was fitted with the curie - weiss law and subsequently @xmath24 value was calculated for both bulk and nanoparticles . for 0.005 t field value , the @xmath24 for bulk , 33 hrs and 75h samples are found to be @xmath29 and @xmath30k respectively .",
    "however , for 0.01 t field value , it varies as @xmath31 and @xmath32k .",
    "the negative value of @xmath24 indicates the presence of antiferromagnetic correlation interaction .",
    "one can see that for both 0.005 and 0.01 t field , @xmath24 decreases with decrease in particle size .",
    "now , according to eq .",
    "[ cw ] , with decrease in @xmath24 , the exchange interaction among magnetic ions decreases and this signifies the weakening of @xmath13 in our nanoparticle samples . according to mean field theory",
    "the frustration parameter is defined as f = @xmath33 . for bulk , ` f ' is nearly 20 and for 75h nanoparticle sample it is 23.6 .",

    "all the three transitions can be clearly seen.,width=321 ]    to investigate the low temperature behaviour of @xmath14 , magnetization measurement down to 0.4k at different applied dc magnetic fields were carried out as shown in fig .",
    "[ fighe_rrr ] . with increase in",
    "applied dc magnetic field , the peak temperature ( @xmath14 ) is found to be shifted to lower temperatures which is a characteristic feature of a spin - glass . in such a situation , the peak temperature ( @xmath14 ) is identified as the freezing temperature represented as @xmath34 in the ensuing analysis .",
    "the small kinks seen in the main panel of fig .",
    "[ fighe_rrr ] , in low temperature region ( @xmath35 ) are may be due to experimental errors .",
    "we fit the observed freezing temperature to the power law relation which is well known as de almeida  thouless ( at ) equation @xcite , given by    @xmath36    and is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fighe_rrr ] . here , @xmath37 is the width of the distribution of exchange interaction and @xmath3 is the freezing temperature at zero magnetic field .",
    "the fitting parameter we used is @xmath3 .",
    "the zero field freezing point was obtained by extrapolating the at line to the temperature axis and is found to be @xmath3=10.1k as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fighe_rrr ] .",
    "the error in determining freezing temperatures is very small ( barely visible ) and is evaluated by the temperature step size for the measurement of @xmath38 0.2k .",
    "it can be seen that the freezing temperature @xmath34 , corresponding to which the magnetization value @xmath39 becomes non - zero ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig1k ] ) indicating the onset of freezing temperature , decreases ( low temperature shift ) with increase in applied dc magnetic field ( h ) .",
    "it shows a @xmath40 dependence , which reflects 2d surface like spin - glass behaviour .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that , in bulk the system reflects 3d ferrimagnetic behaviour and in nanoparticle regime it reflects a 2d spin - glass like behaviour with @xmath41 .",
    "this 2d spin - glass like nature is associated with the surface spin character of the @xmath42 nanoparticles . however , core of the nanoparticle is still ferrimagnetic in nature . in this regard , the temperature dependent response of magnetization from bulk to nanoparticle could be more informative ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig1k ] ) .",
    "the weakening of ferrimagnetic transitions ( @xmath13 ) and strengthening of low temperature peak ( @xmath43 ) could be seen from bulk to nanoparticle regime with the evolution of a new peak ( @xmath44 ) towards higher temperature side . obviously , the surface ( shell ) spins have dominating role / effect compared to bulk ( core ) spins in the nanoparticles which leads to the conclusion that ferrimagnetically ordered spins are quite less in number in comparasion to the surface spins .",
    "the origin and nature of the @xmath1 will be discussed latter in the letter .",
    "sample in 0.1 t cooling field .",
    "inset shows the zfc of respective samples .",
    "all the three transitions can be clearly seen.,width=321 ]    the presence of spin - glass like phase in the reported system might be due to superparamagnetism and at line analysis alone is not sufficient . hence it is necessary to implement another experimental evidence to establish the claim of spin - glass phase in our system .",
    "thus , the frequency dependent ac susceptibility analysis was done to establish this claim .",
    "[ chi ] , shows the real part of the ac susceptibility ( @xmath45 ) as a function of temperature measured at frequencies 7 , 73 , and 143 hz . for this measurement ,",
    "the sample was first cooled down to 4k from 300k .",
    "then a probing ac magnetic field of amplitude 1 oe was applied for the ac susceptibility measurement .",
    "the dc biasing field was set to zero during data accusation . the freezing temperature ( @xmath34 ) is identified as the peak in the curve and found to be shifted towards high temperature with increase in frequency .",
    "it is believed that superparamagnetism ( spm ) can also give rise to peaks in ac ` @xmath46 ' measurements accompanied by frequency dependent shift in peak ( blocking temperature in spm ) positions can be seen , similar to the results shown in fig .",
    "the two magnetic phases ( spm and spin - glass ) can be distinguished by the empirical quantity @xmath47 $ ] , with values varying from 0.004 - 0.018 for spin - glass to as large as 0.3 for spm @xcite . here ,",
    "@xmath48 , is the shift in freezing temperature for spin - glass phase from @xmath3 . for 75h sample ,",
    "the value of the empirical quantity is found to be 0.05 which is close to the spin - glass phase . to understand the dynamical behaviour of the spin glass phase near freezing temperature ,",
    "two different theoretical approaches have been adopted .",
    "the first approach assumes that a phase transition takes place at the freezing temperature in the vicinity of which a critical behaviour in the temperature dependence of relaxation time ( @xmath49 ) is expected .",
    "this is known as critical slowing down model . in this model ,",
    "the critical relaxation time , defined as @xmath50 , near the transition point is related to the correlation length ( @xmath51 ) of the spins and is expressed in the form of a power law as given below @xcite .",
    "the freezing temperatures obtained from fig . [ chi ] were fitted with the power law equation , @xmath52 where , @xmath49=@xmath53 , f is the frequency of the ac @xmath46 measurement , @xmath4 is the relaxation time constant normally lying in the range of @xmath54 to @xmath55 sec and @xmath56 is the critical exponent . the fitting shown in the inset ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ chi ] , has yielded parameter values as @xmath57 , @xmath58 = 8.66k and @xmath56=11.1 .     and [ vf law].,width=321 ]    here , the value of relaxation time constant @xmath57 is larger at least by a factor of @xmath59 than the normal value for spin glass phase .",
    "the reason for this is not understood .",
    "however , the value of @xmath60 is close to the @xmath58 value 10.1k obtained from at line analysis .",
    "the obtained value of critical exponent ` @xmath56 ' ( 11.1k ) matches well with the typical value of ` @xmath56 ' for spin - glass system ranging from 4 to 12 @xcite , suggesting a spin - glass ground state in @xmath42 nanoparticles .",
    "the second approach assumes that the freezing phase transition is a non - equilibrium phenomenon and the dynamical properties of spin glass phase can be explored by vogel - fulcher law .",
    "this law takes into account the interacting property of spin - glass clusters .",
    "the vogel - fulcher law is expressed as ,    @xmath61 , \\label{vf law}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath62 represents the energy barrier or activation energy and @xmath63 is the phenomenological parameter describing interaction between clusters .",
    "the plot of @xmath34 vs. ln(1/f ) is plotted together with the fitted curve given in eq . [ vf law ] and is shown in the inset ( b ) of fig .",
    "the fitted parameters are @xmath64 = 58.9k , @xmath9 and @xmath63 = 8.03k .",
    "the non - negative value of @xmath63 = @xmath65k indicates the presence of interacting spin - glass clusters .",
    "moreover , for @xmath66 , eq . [ vf law ]",
    "reduces to arrhenius law given by @xmath67 . in this situation ,",
    "the inter - cluster interaction is negligible . in view of this relation ,",
    "the fitted data give unreasonably low value of @xmath4 ( @xmath68sec ) , which seems much faster than the atomic relaxation of spins ( @xmath69sec ) which is physically not possible .",
    "now our basic concern is to understand the mechanism responsible for the generation of spin glass like phase in @xmath0 nanoparticle which shows a different behaviour as compared to its bulk counterpart .",
    "the 2d nature of the spin glass phase established using at - line fitting indicates a surface effect .",
    "this may be associated with either spin canting or surface spin disorder .",
    "spin canting exists due to two competing magnetic exchanges ( one is isotropic and the other is asymmetric in nature ) . the marginal weakening of ferrimagnetic transition in 75h sample is an indication of weakening of isotropic exchange .",
    "further , the bulk @xmath0 does not show glassy feature in our measurements confirming existing reports to the best of our knowledge .",
    "therefore , we ruled out spin canting as the reason for existing surface effect in @xmath0 nanoparticle .",
    "actually , surface effects result from the lack of translational symmetry at the boundaries of the particle because of the lower coordination number there and the existence of broken magnetic exchange bond which leads to surface spin disorder and frustration @xcite .",
    "another important effect is the finite size effect which is observed in nanoparticle sample .",
    "this effect originates from the cut off of some characteristic length due to the purely geometric constraint on finite volume .",
    "it results in superparamagnetic behaviour , which is not present in our sample ( already pointed out in earlier discussion ) .",
    "finally , it is observed that nanoparticle sample has higher value of mean field frustration parameter ` f ' ( 23.6 ) as compare to its bulk sample ( f=20 ) .",
    "also , weakening of @xmath13 in nanoparticle sample indicates absence of long range ferrimagnetic ordering and in fact exhibits spin - glass behaviour .",
    "this fulfils the general condition for the system to be geometrically frustrated magnet ( gfm ) .",
    "hence , the @xmath0 nanoparticle sample might be retaining geometrical frustration .",
    "from the entire study , the following points can be concluded : 1 .",
    "the nanoparticle of @xmath0 shows 2d spin glass like character at low temperature with @xmath34= 10.1k .",
    "vogel - fulcher law analysis confirms the existence of interacting spin clusters .",
    "the surface spin disorder seems to be the reason for the existence of 2d spin glass feature .",
    "the decrease in magnetization value of @xmath0 nanoparticle compared to its bulk counterpart may be due to the surface spin disorder .",
    "the existence of new transition ( @xmath1 ) may be due to the presence of weak ferrimagnetic spin clusters .",
    "+ 5 . the @xmath0 nanoparticles may be considered as a gfm due to higher value of ` f ' parameter , absence of long range ordering and the presence of spin glass ground state .",

    "<S> in this report , the magnetic behaviour of @xmath0 bulk and nanoparticle samples under different applied magnetic field has been investigated extensively . </S>",
    "<S> nanoparticles of @xmath0 were obtained by mechanical milling of polycrystalline powder prepared by polyol method . </S>",
    "<S> fc - zfc measurement of bulk at different applied magnetic field has revealed the existence of a ferrimagnetic transition around 66k followed by an antiferromagnetic transition close to 30k . </S>",
    "<S> however , its nano counterpart has shown remarkable change in magnetic properties - a suppression of ferrimagnetic transition accompanied by strengthening low temperature magnetic phase and observation of a new transition at 90k ( @xmath1 ) , which is weakly magnetic in nature . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency dependent ac susceptibility data of nanoparticle have been fitted to the well known de almedia - thouless equation and a @xmath2 dependence of the low temperature peak is observed with a resulting zero field freezing temperature ( @xmath3 ) equal to 10.1k . </S>",
    "<S> further , the dynamical behaviour near freezing temperature has been analysed in terms of critical behaviour and the obtained fitted parameters values being as @xmath4(relaxation time constant ) = @xmath5 , @xmath6k and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , vogel - fulcher law has been used to understand the nature of freezing transition and the parameter after fitting are obtained as @xmath8k , @xmath9 and @xmath10k . finally , the spin - glass phase is concluded . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in contrast to bulk , the @xmath2 dependence of freezing temperature of nanoparticle sample ( 75h ) does support the 2d surface like spin glass nature .    </S>",
