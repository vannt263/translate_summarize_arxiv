    "weak boson fusion ( wbf ) process involves promising results in the context of current researches , mainly centered in the standard model ( sm ) examination @xcite .",
    "wbf consists in the generation of a higgs particle from a weak boson in association with two hard ( in the present case , fermion ) jets in the forward and backward regions of the detector .",
    "it is an important channel in the search for the higgs boson and a relevant source of data in the measure of its mass , in the study of cp properties and the couplings to the top quark , tau lepton and weak gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been pointed as a relevant channel in the study of the @xmath0 yukawa cupling @xcite and the frontiers of new high energy physics @xcite .    on - shell recursive formulations based on the helicity spinor formalism",
    "have proved to be powerful tools in phenomenology with a far reach .",
    "britto - cachazo - feng - witten ( bcfw ) @xcite approach conduces to fast computations of multi - leg partial color - ordered amplitudes that become the essential gauge - invariant constituents of complete amplitudes as a consequence of the basic polar behavior and analyticity properties of the @xmath1 matrix .",
    "discrete symmetries and the introduction of adequate reference structures based in gauge invariance increase the effectiveness of the scheme making amplitude computation more efficient .",
    "further schemes had already introduced the characterization of both massive fermions and bosons in this formalism , the expansion to one and two loops calculations in some processes @xcite and also its use in numerical schemes . nevertheless , there are still some features in the path of exploration at tree level with desirable potential in amplitudes estimation . in this context , the study of inverse soft limit process as a solely scheme for amplitudes construction is particularly relevant @xcite as it is the study of collinear momenta limits .    in previous investigations @xcite , it has been stated the relevance of qcd corrections to wbf process , particularly , additional gluon emissions . in this same spirit ,",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the convenience of introducing the bcfw recursion scheme in this particular context .",
    "the objective was to obtain tree level amplitudes with the sm couplings , up to second order in qcd and at first order in wbf higgs production process .",
    "it was considered the limit of massless fermions and the amplitudes were obtained with every external particle as a final state .",
    "there were considered up to two gluon emissions and the results agreed with the associated feynman diagrams in all the cases . in this particular process , while more conventional approaches had been taken into account , the bcfw approach discussed in this paper is original and has not been observed in the literature .    after stating in a explicit way the convention chosen for helicity spinors , polarization vectors and amplitudes ( section [ conventions ] ) ,",
    "the fundamentals of bcfw scheme at tree level are discussed in section [ bcfwformalism ] ( specific known results and properties of helicity spinor formalism are presented in appendix [ results ] ) .",
    "once this formalism is introduced , the details of its application in the wbf process are shown in section [ wbfandhiggsproduction ] , in which the essential blocks needed for the computation and the way symmetries relate these amplitudes are also discussed .",
    "the relevant tree level amplitudes related to wbf process and the studied qcd corrections ( 1 and 2 gluon emissions ) are written explicitly and a final discussion is presented in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "the essential tool of the formalism , the helicity spinor , has been introduced with several conventions . despite the fact that they are all equivalent , it is easy to get messy",

    "only the @xmath57 or @xmath98 factors from the vertices and propagators are carried in the partial amplitudes . also ,",
    "since the amplitudes are color - ordered , the qcd vertices come from the color - ordered feynman rules , which are readily obtained from the usual couplings .",

    "it is possible to show that one must demand @xmath107 .",
    "expressions like @xmath108 may be treated as @xmath109 ; this may be considered an extension of the process of analytic continuation made from the positive energy case to introduce negative energy spinors @xcite . additionally , according to the possible phases , in the boson propagator case one",
    "may eliminate the minus signs in the momenta of the spinors and insert a minus sign for each pair of these spinors of the same kind ( angle or square ) in a product ( if it is a quotient , it is clear that the phases vanish and no minus is introduced ) .    from the operational definition proposed for left and right spinors",
    ", it may be expected one phase , ( @xmath110 or @xmath111 ) to be the opposite of the other one .",
    "however , as pointed out in @xcite , for complex momenta , angle and square spinors are not in general complex conjugates of each other .",
    "observe that if @xmath112 , then @xmath113 in particular , this permits to introduce nonsingular tree level amplitudes for 3 legs vertices in which all momentum invariants vanish @xcite .",
    "it is also necessary to make a correction when dealing with fermion propagators .",
    "observe that in the bcfw recursion formula the direction in the momentum on the propagator was fixed .",
    "as is seen in figure  [ bcfw ] , @xmath80 is shown as an incoming momentum in the left sub - amplitude ( and as an outgoing momentum in the right one ) and the signs in ( [ bcfwform ] ) are stated according to this choice ( in order to preserve the prescription of outgoing momenta in partial amplitudes ) .",
    "because of this , additional multiplicative phases must be introduced according to the real sign in the slash factor that would be expected for the propagator in a feynman amplitude .    in order to understand how these phases are introduced ,",
    "there are some important observations to be made .",
    "first , it can be shown that , in general , an intermediate fermion state appears with a factorization of amplitudes in which the left one has the angle or square ket with momentum @xmath114 an odd number of times .",
    "this can be seen as a consequence of the bcfw process since elaborate amplitudes are worked out from simpler ones and they are all constructed from a set of basic blocks which come directly from the feynman vertices ( see section [ basic ] ) . in those blocks , the kets or bras associated with boson particles appear an even number of times while the fermion particles appear an odd number of times . as the bcfw scheme is applied ,",
    "these characteristics are preserved in more complex amplitudes in a inductive process .",
    "the denominator of a propagator will always provide an even number of spinors of each particle involved since it is related with the square of the intermediate momentum .",
    "the spinors with the intermediate shifted momentum ( @xmath114 or @xmath80 ) will always appear an even number of times when counting both the left and right amplitudes ; these are always replaced and written in terms of the known momenta .",
    "the expression for @xmath115 guarantees that @xmath116 always introduces an even number of spinors of each involved momentum .",
    "then , the number of spinors remains odd for fermions and even for bosons after the process is done to construct more complex amplitudes .",
    "then , in the case of a fermion propagator , after transforming the @xmath114 kets in the left amplitude by pairs with the prescription stated before , there will be a remaining ket ( since there are an odd number of them ) for which the phase is introduced according to the momentum flow in the propagator .",
    "consider the case in which the remaining ket is in the numerator of the amplitude .",
    "then , if the fermion arrow goes in the direction of @xmath80 , a common feynman amplitude would demand the introduction of a @xmath117\\left\\langle { \\left .",
    "\\hat p \\right| } \\right .",
    "\\hat p \\right\\rangle \\left .",
    "{ \\left [ \\hat p \\right . }",
    "\\right|$ ] , so the ket is replaced with no phase , @xmath103 } \\right.,\\left| { - \\hat p } \\right\\rangle   \\to \\left| { \\left . {",
    "\\hat p } \\right ] } \\right.,\\left| { \\hat p } \\right\\rangle $ ] .",
    "if the fermion arrow goes in the opposite direction , it would be associated with a @xmath118 , so one makes the replacement with a minus , @xmath103 } \\right.,\\left| { - \\hat p } \\right\\rangle   \\to   - \\left| { \\left . { \\hat p } \\right ] } \\right .",
    ", - \\left| { \\hat p } \\right\\rangle $ ] .",
    "the case in which the remaining ket is in the denominator results in a minus when the arrow and the momentum directions match , and no phase in the opposite case .    in a computational perspective , this set of prescriptions may be implemented in a more simple and equivalent way by introducing a @xmath57 factor for each angle or square ket with momentum @xmath114 and , in the case of fermion propagators , introducing an additional @xmath98 factor if the arrow and the momentum directions match , and a @xmath57 in the opposite case .",
    "the sum over the intermediate particle states is more often done over the helicities , following the original scheme . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed as an alternative the sum over spin states , particularly when dealing with massive intermediate particles . in our case of interest , for instance ,",
    "this scheme was used when dealing with vector boson propagators and is of special effectiveness when it is possible to use any form of the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the number of required amplitudes is reduced by a couple of factors .",
    "the first one is a number of symmetries that relate amplitudes with different sets of helicities , improving the effectiveness of the helicity approach .",
    "some of these will be discussed in the next sections . in second place",
    ", the freedom in the polarization vectors and the forms that vector contractions take ( see appendix [ resultspolvec ] ) guarantees that a lot of qcd amplitudes vanish when the number of gluons with the same helicity is too high .",
    "the argument is simple and is treated in several references like @xcite .",
    "this is the origin of the designation of the maximally helicity violating or mhv amplitudes ; those that hold the maximum number of helicities of the same kind without vanishing .",
    "these two features also lead to an even faster application of bcfw formula as the needed blocks became manifest by considering these aspects .    as a final observation",
    ", it is well known that in the amplitudes simplifications it is useful to form complete operators with the structures @xmath119 and @xmath120 } \\right.\\left\\langle { \\hat p } \\right|$ ] .",
    "this tends to simplify the algebra by contracting with the appropriate factors and reminding that @xmath121 .",
    "the relevant processes in which higgs particles are expected at the proton - proton lhc collider are gluon fusions ( @xmath122 ) , wbf ( @xmath123 ) , higgs - strahlung ( @xmath124 ) and higgs bremsstrahlung off a top quark ( @xmath125 ) @xcite . despite the fact that gluon fusion process has a higher total cross - section than wbf",
    ", it plays an important role in the determination of higgs couplings and even bounds on non - standard couplings @xcite .    at tree level ,",
    "wbf process is a pure electroweak ( ew ) process , in which the main contributions come from _",
    "t _ and _ u _ types of channels as some strong interactions process are suppressed @xcite .",
    "nlo qcd corrections are relevant in order to obtain more reliable predictions in order to reduce substantial theoretical uncertainties @xcite .",
    "it has been found @xcite that these corrections to integrated cross sections are small but a suppression of virtual gluon corrections observed at one loop is an interesting feature to be examined at higher orders .",
    "recursion schemes may provide a useful approach in this research .",
    "the following computations are obtained with the aid of the helicity spinor formalism and the bcfw tree level recursion scheme with a parallel presentation of the feynman associated amplitudes . in order to do that , we first introduce some basic blocks . with the sm couplings and up to second order in qcd and at first order in wbf higgs production process , we obtain tree level amplitudes up to two gluon emissions .",
    "thus , they will be obtained up to second order in weak boson couplings with fermions and up to first order in weak boson couplings with the higgs scalar . as it was stated before",
    ", this bcfw approach has not been observed in the literature for this particular process .",
    "the main blocks needed in the process and its qcd corrections are those corresponding to the vertex between a vector boson and fermions , and the three legs qcd vertices .",
    "these blocks are obtained by contracting the vertices with the associated on - shell external legs . as a benefit of the use of the bcfw and due to the non abelian ward identity",
    ", the four gluons vertex of qcd is not necessary as a basic block .",
    "these basic blocks are obtained directly from their associated color - ordered feynman rules with the prescriptions chosen for the partial amplitudes pointed out in the previous section . as the matter of fact , it was found that with the right @xmath57 and @xmath64 choices , the three gluons vertex was not necessary in the amplitudes we wanted to find .",

    "as can be seen , there are some symmetries that relate these basic blocks . in the spirit of reducing the number of amplitudes , mixing several symmetries",
    "is also a valuable tool .",
    "for instance , parity transformation changes each helicity into its opposite . in a partial amplitude",
    "all the coupling factors that may express the lack of this symmetry are already stripped out .",
    "then , it can be expected that a partial amplitude has the same norm that the one with opposite helicities . the specific relation between these ones",
    "is shown by the basic blocks from the previous section ; observe that ( treating with care the @xmath57 factors on both sides of the expressions ) they are the complex conjugate of each other . clearly , in more elaborated amplitudes",
    ", this conjugation ( often known as parity conjugation ) does not change those terms that are not affected by parity transformation and , in consequence , under parity conjugation are not replaced by their conjugates ( like the complex width terms in the propagators of massive bosons ) .",
    "then , in general obtaining the parity conjugate of an amplitude tends to be a simple task taking into account the behavior of spinor products under complex conjugation in the chosen convention ( see ( [ conjug1 ] ) , ( [ conjug2 ] ) and ( [ conjug3 ] ) ) .",
    "line reversal symmetry or reflection symmetry @xcite relates a partial amplitude for the production of a set of particles in a specific order with the one for the production of the reversed order with quarks being replaced by antiquarks .",
    "this may be written as @xmath143 in which the specific phase factor @xmath144 that states this relation is given by the basic blocks used in the construction of the amplitudes and depends on the kind of particles involved ( also , it may be different in other spinor conventions ) .",
    "for instance , consider how the amplitudes for the blocks @xmath126 or @xmath127 are related between each other ( ( [ qvqbar1 ] ) and ( [ qvqbar2 ] ) ) ; as can be seen , the reversed order of particles is obtained with no additional phase .",
    "the phases for line reversal in qcd partial amplitudes are well known . in our convention ,",
    "qcd blocks come with @xmath145 and @xmath146 in the @xmath147 and @xmath148 amplitudes respectively , with @xmath149 the number of quarks and antiquarks and @xmath150 the number of gluons ( see the basic qcd blocks in the previous section )",
    ". these phases will provide the adequate factors in order to take into account this symmetry in more elaborated amplitudes .",
    "for instance , one of interest in the kind of processes we are treating is the associated with the production of one vector boson , a number @xmath149 of quarks and antiquarks , and a number @xmath150 of gluons . the phase that relates this amplitude with the reversed one is ( in our convention ) @xmath151 @xcite .    as the matter of fact",
    ", line reversal is seen even in subamplitudes as will be shown in the following computations .",
    "this is a particularly useful feature of this symmetry .",
    "in fact , the blocks @xmath126 or @xmath127 and @xmath130 display the effect of charge conjugation transformation .",
    "for instance , consider the amplitude in which a single fermion pair coupled to a gauge boson is produced and the amplitude for the production of the reversed ( in the sense stated before ) fermion pair .",
    "according to the phases stated before , it can be obtained one from the other by just interchanging the corresponding fermion labels in the known amplitude ; in this particular case , the reversed line is just the pair quark - antiquark coupled to the boson @xcite .",
    "we must mention also cyclic reordering .",
    "the use of this relation is particularly important when working on unpolarized cross sections , in which all the helicities configurations must be taken into account . often , the only difference between two amplitudes is just a cyclic reordering in the set of colored particles . as can be expected , this amounts effectively to a reordering of particle labels so different amplitudes may be obtained by the adequate renaming of spinors and momenta ( cyclic character obeys the structure of color ordered amplitudes ) .",
    "for instance , in the basic blocks for three gluons ( ( [ blockggg1 ] ) and ( [ blockggg2 ] ) ) the remaining non - vanishing amplitudes may be obtained as cyclic reorderings of the shown amplitudes .      , are assumed to have no coupling with a higgs boson , not even by an intermediate state of the sub - amplitude , except for a vector boson leg to which the scalar is coupled.,scaledwidth=32.0% ]    consider now a number of particles , @xmath62 , that are assumed to have no coupling with a higgs boson , as shown in figure  [ higgslegs ] .",

    "hence , when constructing the amplitude with this scheme , the bcfw diagrams contributing are the same than the higgs - less case but with the higgs leg inserted always in the side where the vector boson is attached .",
    "observe that the momentum in the vector boson propagator before the higgs coupling remains as @xmath156 regardless of the shifts ( neither the higgs nor the vector boson momenta are going to be shifted ) and that the momentum in the propagator of the bcfw factorization can be written in terms of the momenta of the factorized ( left or right ) amplitude with no vector boson ( writing the momentum of the propagator in terms of momenta with no spinorial form , like massive bosons momenta , is discouraged since that term will be computed with other spinor products ) . in consequence , the result is the introduction of the higgs vertex and the vector boson propagator in each diagram .",

    "hence , except for special cases like the one treated with the higgs particle , the algebra of this terms combined with the spinor algebra gets tedious .",
    "then , the easiest solution is to find scenarios in which it is not necessary to operate with them , simply because the value of the momenta in the propagators is the expected one ( not a possible shifted value ) .",

    "the effectiveness of the helicity spinor formalism is more evident as the number of external legs grows .",
    "this is particularly manifest in the kind of processes we are considering .",

    "in fact , they only differ in the position on the higgs particle , as the case we discussed in the previous section .",
    "furthermore , a little of algebra proves that the contractions of the amplitudes in the numerator are independent of the shift in all the possible sets of helicities .",

    "this is done by introducing specific helicities for external particles in ( [ feynampnogluon ] ) .",
    "it is relevant to point out an important warning concerning the selection of the bcfw diagrams that contribute .",

    "notwithstanding , these last diagrams do not contribute to the amplitude we are trying to find and there are two fundamental reasons .",
    "as can be seen , these diagrams are based in crossings of particles . in first place , in the following amplitudes we ll be dealing with gluon emissions and this kind of crossings introduces a modification in the color factor dependence ; the quark indices associated with the su(3 ) generators would be shifted . in second place , these crossings are forbidden when dealing with a w boson ; the crossed diagrams are possible only with a z boson interaction . these contributions ,",
    "as it was pointed out before , will be considered as reorderings written in terms of the basic amplitudes we are looking for with the bcfw scheme . in the following computations no further comments will be made concerning this point but it should be kept in mind .",
    "the kind of qcd tree level corrections studied were the emissions of 1 and 2 gluons .           with one gluon emission",
    "the number of diagrams is still reduced . since color - ordered amplitudes are related to specific color structures , it is essential to identify all the color factors involved in a particular amplitude",
    ". it is also a useful practice that leads to summarized expressions .",
    "the feynman diagrams contributing with a specific order can be seen in figure  [ feynman1gluon ] .",
    "these provide an amplitude which is a function of the labeled particles .",
    "then , by inserting the order of the remaining 2 feynman diagrams ( the gluon being emitted by the 4 and 5 fermion legs ) , it is possible to write the full amplitude in terms of these basic structures .",
    "this is the natural scheme in which the bcfw formula will provide complete amplitudes ; after identifying the basic constituents ( which share the same color dependence ) , the complete amplitude is obtained as the appropriate sum of them .",
    "the amplitude according to the feynman diagrams is @xmath180 with @xmath181 @xmath182 @xmath183 and @xmath184 as defined before .",
    "when considering all the channels , one finds the amplitudes @xmath185 and @xmath186    with the bcfw formula , there are more possible choices for the @xmath169 pair in this case . for the computation of the amplitude we considered two possible approaches .         in the spirit of the wbf tree level amplitude with no gluons",
    ", one can select the particles in a way that guarantees the appearance of the bcfw diagrams with an intermediate state of a vector boson , and , therefore , of the higgs blocks properties that we identified in the previous sections .",
    "then one may study the possibility of choosing again the two quarks as the @xmath57 and @xmath64 particles .",
    "the bcfw diagrams then are those shown in figure  [ bcfw1gluon_1 ] .",
    "as can be seen , the number seems to be relatively high and , despite that some conditions facilitate their computation , the effort seems excessive",
    ".    nevertheless , if one proceeds with this @xmath169 choice , there are some new blocks to be found before making the computation .",
    "the ones that were already found are the basic @xmath130 and @xmath126 or @xmath127 blocks , and the wbf amplitudes we found before .",
    "those that remain are the addition of a higgs particle to the @xmath126 or @xmath127 blocks ( which is done according to the prescription we introduced before ) and the addition of a gluon to the same diagrams .",
    "these last ones are part of a set of amplitudes that were already found with the bcfw formula in @xcite .",
    "their construction follows the same scheme , and the diagram needed is shown in figure  [ glover1gluon ] , choosing as @xmath57 and @xmath64 particles the quark and the adjacent gluon .",
