    "supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite provides a natural solution to several unsolved problems in the standard model ( sm ) , such as the gauge hierarchy problem , gauge coupling unification and dark matter candidates .",
    "since supersymmetric particles ( sparticles ) have not been discovered yet , susy must be broken to give them heavy masses escaping the current experimental limit . to avoid light sparticles in the supersymmetric standard model ( ssm ) ,",
    "susy must be broken in a hidden sector , and then the susy breaking effects are mediated to the observable ssm sector by a messenger sector , giving sparticle mass spectrum and coupling constants which may be examined at the lhc or other future experiments .",
    "there are three competitive mediation mechanisms : gravity mediation , gauge mediation , and anomaly mediation .",
    "we are focusing on gauge mediation models  @xcite in this work .    following the discussion of the nelson - seiberg theorem  @xcite which summarizes earlier observations in wess - zumino and dynamical susy breaking models  @xcite ,",
    "r - symmetries are required to build a generic susy breaking model . from phenomenology point of view",
    ", the r - symmetry needs to be broken spontaneously in order to allow for the majorana gaugino mass .",
    "the r - symmetry is usually broken by the susy breaking pseudomodulus  @xcite which gets a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) at loop level through the coleman - weinberg potential  @xcite , or through the inclusion of d - terms  @xcite .",
    "there are also models with tree level r - symmetry breaking from tree level vevs of fields other than the pseudomodulus  @xcite .",
    "these models usually involve many fields with specific r - charges , and the gaugino mass is often generated from multiple vevs of fields at both loop level and tree level in such complicated models  @xcite . a wide class of tree - level susy and r - symmetry breaking models with classically stable pseudomoduli spaces",
    "have been shown to give zero gaugino masses at one loop level @xcite .",
    "nevertheness , it still remains unclear whether in principle the gaugino mass could be generated just from tree level r - symmetry breaking .    in gauge mediation models ,",
    "the susy breaking fields are coupled to messengers which are charged under the sm gauge symmetry .",
    "susy breaking is mediated to the ssm sector through gauge interactions , and soft terms such as the gaugino mass emerge at low energy . for loop level r -",
    "symmetry breaking , the susy breaking pseudomodulus field @xmath0 also breaks the r - symmetry at loop level .",
    "it has the vev @xmath1 the resulting gaugino mass is @xmath2 for a tree level r - symmetry breaking model , we have two fields which breaks susy and r - symmetry respectively .",
    "they have vevs @xmath3 the naive guess for the gaugino mass would be @xmath4 but as we are to show , after a close look at the corresponding loop diagrams , the gaugino mass at one loop turns out to be exactly zero , unless @xmath0 and @xmath5 fields have identical r - charges which make the condition non - generic .",
    "thus tree - level r - symmetry breaking fails its original purpose to generate the gaugino mass , and we obtain the no - go statement .",
    "we will review some result of gauge mediation and set up the notations for our following analysis . since we are concerning how gauginos acquire masses after susy and r - symmetry breaking ,",
    "we ignore the detail of the susy breaking sector , and assume a spurion field @xmath0 as specified in .",
    "@xmath0 couples to the messenger sector through yukawa couplings @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are messengers which are conjugate to each other in sm gauge symmetry .",
    "the non - zero vev of @xmath0 gives a susy breaking spectrum to messenger fields , which is seen from expanding the susy lagrangian in component fields : @xmath9_{\\theta \\theta } + \\text{c.c . }",

    "similar terms also exist for @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding vertexes are shown in figure [ fg:1 ] .",
    "the gauginos obtain masses from the one loop feymann diagram shown in figure [ fg:2 ] , which can be calculated by wave - function renormalization method  @xcite .",

    "the corresponding superpotential is @xmath13 the gaugino mass turns out to be @xmath14 as a consequence of the r - symmetry , the messenger matrix has the identity @xmath15 so we have the gaugino mass @xmath16 which is similar to the result .",
    "the factor @xmath17 in is responsible to the vanishing of gaugino masses in a wide class of tree level susy and r - symmetry breaking models , because a classically stable pseudomoduli spaces require @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "one may relax the classically stabilization condition and build a more general tree level r - symmetry breaking model .",
    "although the obstacle can be avoided , the expression only involves @xmath19 and @xmath20 which are vevs of components of the same superfield @xmath0 .",
    "thus the susy breaking pseudomodulus and the r - symmetry breaking field are identical , and is actually a result of loop level r symmetry breaking . to properly study the effect of tree level r - symmetry breaking , one should refine the model to exclude influence from other effects , as we are to do in the next section .",
    "the essential concept of tree level r - symmetry breaking is the misalignment between the susy breaking pseudomodulus and the r - symmetry breaking field  @xcite .",
    "the r - symmetry breaking field can be decomposed to a component parallel to the pseudomodulus which is actually loop level r - symmetry breaking , and a transverse component which really counts for tree level r - symmetry breaking . based on this decomposition ,",
    "we suppose there are two separated fields @xmath0 and @xmath5 which respectively break susy and the r - symmetry . at the vacuum we have @xmath21 which is just in the form of component fields .",

    "the contact terms of messengers and gauginos are @xmath23_{\\theta \\theta \\bar \\theta \\bar \\theta } = - \\sqrt{2 } g_a ( \\phi_i^ * t^a \\psi_i)\\lambda^a + \\text{c.c . }",
    "+ \\dotsb , \\ ] ] where a minimal khler potential is taken to keep the r - symmetry .",
    "the corresponding vertexes are shown in figure [ fg:3 ] .",
    "fg3    ( 100 , 35 )    ( 100 , 35 )     +    ( 100 , 35 )    ( 100 , 35 )     +    ( 100 , 70 )    ( 100 , 70 )    at first glance , the possible diagrams which could generate gaugino mass can be drawn as in figure [ fg:4 ] , and a similar calculation seems to give the gaugino mass as in .",
    "but after checking the r - charge conservation for each vertex in the loop , it is found that the loop diagram in figure [ fg:4 ] is valid only if @xmath24",
    ". then the r - symmetry allows @xmath0 to have all the coupling which @xmath5 has with messengers , and vise versa .",
    "there is no clear distinction between @xmath0 and @xmath5 fields and the separation becomes non - generic .",
    "fg4    ( 150,100 )    in generic models with @xmath24 , all the four vevs in are non - zero .",
    "if we make a linear combination of them aligned with the f - term , the combination field generically has non - zero vev .",
    "thus tree level r - symmetry breaking , if existing in this type of models , is accompanied with same magnitude of loop level r - symmetry breaking contributing to gaugino masses . for models with @xmath25 , @xmath0 and @xmath5 fields",
    "is clearly separated , can be generically satisfied and tree - level r - symmetry is well defined without interference from loop level r - symmetry breaking . but as we have shown , there is no one - loop diagram for gaugino masses in this case .",
    "we have shown that in generic models with tree level r - symmetry breaking , the gaugino mass either becomes zero at one loop or gets contribution from loop level r - symmetry breaking .",
    "so tree level r - symmetry breaking either fails for its original purpose to generate the gaugino mass , or becomes unnecessary because of the existence of loop level r - symmetry breaking .",
    "thus tree level r - symmetry breaking is proved to be either no - go or redundant for phenomenology model building .",
    "one may try to insert more spurion vertexes into the loop , as shown in figure [ fg:5 ] . noticing the arrow direction of propagators ,",
    "the feynman rules require that either the fermion line or the boson line has odd number of vertexes inserted . checking",
    "the r - symmetry conservation condition turns out that @xmath24 is still required to ensure the existence of the diagram .",
    "so we get the same conclusion as discussed before .",
    "fg5    ( 280,200 )    the essential assumption we made in our proof is the separation of susy and r - symmetry breaking fields as in .",
    "so our analysis covers a wider range of models than just the tree level r - symmetry breaking case , such as in the goldstini senario  @xcite .",
    "whenever there are separate susy breaking sector and r - symmetry breaking sector , all the proof can be followed and we have a similar no - go statement . for simplicity , it is well enough to obtain the gaugino mass from loop level r - symmetry breaking from a single spurion , unless other phenomenology features require a more complicated model .",
    "it should be addressed that our work deals with the majorana gaugino mass which is one of the motivations of r - symmetry breaking .",
    "there are alternative models proposing dirac gaugino mass terms , the dirac mass can be generated from either d - terms or r - symmetric f - terms @xcite .",
    "plus the well - studied majorana gaugino mass from loop level r - symmetry breaking , there are various models and features outside our no - go region for one to explore .",
