    "<S> this phenomenon have led to important insights in non - equilibrium dynamics observed in various active scientific fields , ranging from pattern formation in physical and chemical systems , to self - assembly problems in biology . yet , very few models currently succeed in reproducing the diversity of snowflake forms in three dimensions , and the link between model parameters and thermodynamic quantities is not established . here , we report a modified phase field model that describes the subtlety of the ice vapour phase transition , through anisotropic water molecules attachment and condensation , surface diffusion , and strong anisotropic surface tension , that guarantee the anisotropy , faceting and dendritic growth of snowflakes . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that this model reproduces the growth dynamics of the most challenging morphologies of snowflakes from the nakaya diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the growth dynamics of snow crystals matches the selection theory , consistently with previous experimental observations .    </S>",
    "<S> snowflake growth in supersaturated atmosphere is one of the most familiar , and at the same time scientifically challenging physical phenomena @xcite . beyond aesthetic fascination for their symmetric shape , </S>",
    "<S> snow crystals provide us with a unique example of self - patterning systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> early experiments on artificial snow crystals in cold chamber led by nakaya @xcite , revealed this fundamental phase transition resulted in a wide manifold of patterns , exclusively determined by supersaturation and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this dependency was later formalized in the meteorological classification of magono @xcite , and the snow crystals morphology diagram of nakaya @xcite .    despite this clear experimental picture , the underlying physical rules remain thoroughly debatable @xcite , as evidenced by the numerous models proposed to understand the variety of snowflake shapes , such as the surface diffusion model of mason et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the quasi - liquid layer approach of lacmann et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and the layer nucleation rates theory by nelson @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , many simulation methods were developed to reproduce the growth dynamics of snowflakes . </S>",
    "<S> first step toward the comprehension of ice crystal growth was provided by molecular dynamics simulations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , such simulations are still confined to space and time scales by several orders inferior to snowflake characteristic scales @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> significant results were also achieved using the mesoscopic approach , such as the cellular automata model of gravner and griffeath @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> though this model remarkably describes the morphology of snowflakes , the numerous parameters of this model can hardly be related to physical quantities .    from this perspective </S>",
    "<S> , a 3d sharp interface model was developed by barrett et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> different snowflake morphologies were simulated . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the side branching @xcite , surface markings @xcite , and coalescence @xcite of ice crystals could not be reproduced in this framework . </S>",
    "<S> besides , only small supersaturations were prospected . consequently , only the bottom of the nakaya diagram was explored . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation comes from the laplacian approximation framework , and the numerical cost of interface parametrization @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase field model has the decisive advantage to overcome explicit tracking of the sharp interface , by spreading it out over a small layer @xcite . as a matter of fact </S>",
    "<S> , it has become standard to simulate the dendritic growth in alloy solidification @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , despite a prototype attempt by barret et al . in @xcite , the phase field approach was never used to simulate snow crystal growth in three dimensions . indeed , until recently , it was assumed that the phase field approach was unable to reproduce facet formation and destabilization @xcite . yet , debierre and karma suggested in @xcite , that phase field could mimic faceting using highly anisotropic surface tension .    in this paper , we report the simulations of snow crystals growth in three dimensions , using a modified phase field model . a new surface tension anisotropy function accounting for the 6-fold horizontal and 2-fold vertical symmetry of snowflakes was derived . </S>",
    "<S> a supplementary anisotropy function , and anisotropic diffusion terms were also included to simulate the vertical anisotropy of snowflakes @xcite . to mimic faceting in snowflakes , the 2d regularization algorithm of eggleston et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite was extended to three dimensions . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the model reproduces the growth of the main snowflake morphologies of the nakaya diagram , varying only four phenomenological parameters . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that these parameters can be related to physical quantities . </S>",
    "<S> simulated snowflakes show excellent agreement with experimental observations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their growth satisfies the microscopic solvability theory @xcite , consistently with experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> snowflake growth in supersaturated water vapour was simulated using a phase field approach in three dimensions , based on a methodology developed in @xcite . in this model , </S>",
    "<S> two coupled variables @xmath0 and @xmath1 are considered . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is an order parameter referring to the ice ( @xmath2 ) and vapour ( @xmath3 ) phases . </S>",
    "<S> the ice / vapour interface is described by a continuous variation of @xmath0 , connecting @xmath3 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath4 is the reduced supersaturation of water vapour , where @xmath5 is the saturation number density of vapour above ice , at temperature @xmath6 . </S>",

    "<S> the double well potential @xmath10 is the free energy density of the ice / vapour system , at temperature @xmath6 , and saturation concentration @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> the second term in equation accounts for the coupling between @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and promotes ice phase growth in supersaturated atmosphere , where @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> formally , it corresponds to the first order term in the taylor expansion of the bulk potential , for @xmath13 in the neighbourhood of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant @xmath15 can thus be computed by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the free energy barrier between vapor and solid phases . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath18 is an interpolation function introduced in @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . its form allows to keep the bulk potential minima at @xmath19 for any @xmath1 . to describe the strong anisotropy of snowflake growth along the vertical axis @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we propose to introduce the anisotropy function @xmath20 . here , @xmath21 is the unit normal vector of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath22 governs the preference between horizontal and vertical growth , called the primary habit of snowflakes . </S>",
    "<S> it can be empirically related to the temperature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the addition of the first two terms in equation corresponds to the anisotropic thermodynamic driving force .    </S>",
    "<S> the last two terms in equation describe the ice / vapour interface formation and propagation @xcite , where @xmath23 is the surface tension anisotropy function . in this work , a new expression of the anisotropy function was derived : @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the polar and azimuthal angles respectively . </S>",
    "<S> it accounts for both the horizontal 6-fold symmetry , and the vertical planar symmetry of snowflakes . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are anisotropy constants .    </S>",
    "<S> the equation describes the one - sided diffusion of water molecules in vapour , and vapour condensation on ice . </S>",
    "<S> diffusion is controlled by two quantities : the function @xmath29 , which prohibits diffusion within ice , and the reduced diffusion coefficient @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the diffusion coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> the second term in equation accounts for conversion of vapour into ice . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 can thus be interpreted as the rate of water depletion in vapour , via molecule attachment at the interface . in this study , @xmath32 was treated as a numerical parameter , and its setting was conditioned by the choice of @xmath15 . here , @xmath33 , to allow a sufficiently fast crystal growth . obviously , attachment kinetics limited growth enabling snowflake faceting is lost . </S>",
    "<S> faceting is yet recovered through the highly anisotropic interface , as suggested by debierre and karma in @xcite . to account for the anisotropy of the water molecule attachment kinetics on snow crystals @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , the anisotropy function @xmath34 is introduced in the second term of equation as well . </S>",
    "<S> the vertical / horizontal growth preference is also considered through anisotropic diffusion @xcite , @xmath35 .    constants @xmath15 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath36 are entangled by the asymptotic analysis mapping the phase field model to stefan sharp interface model , as shown in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this sets @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the isotropic capillarity length . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : table ] compiles equilibrium shapes of simulated snowflakes , using the parameters in table [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> an achievement of our model is to recover the principal snowflake morphologies of the nakaya diagram @xcite , depending exclusively on four parameters : @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath32 and @xmath50 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first parameter @xmath48 fully determines the primary habit in our model . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest this parameter may be fitted on the yield between prismatic and basal attachment coefficients @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this yield accounts for the alternation of dominating growth mechanisms with the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> two theories are proposed to explain this alternation of growth preference : surface nucleation for low temperatures @xcite , and quasi - liquid layer growth causing surface roughening @xcite near the melting point @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> then , hertz - knudsen relation for facet normal velocity @xcite makes supersaturation @xmath49 the priming parameter in facet instability and growth velocity @xcite . in the phase field model </S>",
    "<S> , the impact of @xmath49 is reinterpreted as the thermodynamic driving force , and higher values also favour branching instability and faster growth @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath32 controls the compactness of branching for non faceted growth @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , low values foster branching instability , while raising @xmath32 drives the system toward quasistatic diffusion , and fosters a stronger faceting . as for the parameter @xmath50 </S>",
    "<S> , it mainly influences the formation of surface patterns for horizontal growth .    </S>",
    "<S> especially interesting are two model examples . </S>",
    "<S> first , the double plate [ sandwich ] ( p. 75 in @xcite ) , results from the _ sandwich instability _ of a flat snowflake , and the twelve arms star [ 12star ] was simulated by the aggregation of two simple stars , with a @xmath51 tilt @xcite .    finally , simulated snowflake morphology depends on temperature and density excess over vapour / water equilibrium @xmath52 ( g.m@xmath53 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is quantitatively consistent with the nakaya diagram ( see @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> using @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the vapour / ice equilibrium density , and fitting @xmath48 on @xcite , our simulations predict plate formation near @xmath56 and @xmath57 , versus @xmath58 , @xmath57 , but also @xmath59 in the nakaya diagram . </S>",
    "<S> simulated dendrites occur near @xmath60 , versus @xmath61 and @xmath62 for experiments . </S>",
    "<S> finally , hollow columns are formed at @xmath63 in our simulations , versus @xmath63 and @xmath64 in the nakaya diagram . however , small supersaturations @xmath65 are beyond reach for our model . </S>",
    "<S> this shortcoming is complementary to the model of barrett et al </S>",
    "<S> . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the latter is bound to @xmath66 or @xmath67c , due to the laplacian approximation for small supersaturations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our model on the contrary requires larger values for @xmath32 , and greater computational resources are needed to reach such supersaturations .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the proposed modified phase field model is able to reproduce the complex dynamics of snowflake growth . </S>",
    "<S> benefiting from the modularity and versatility of the phase field model , this approach can be extended to describe the growth of snowflakes in the real atmospheric conditions . </S>",
    "<S> it can notably be equipped with stochastic effects , for the asymmetric growth of more exotic morphologies of snowflakes in the nakaya diagram . </S>",
    "<S> continuum fluid dynamics can also be easily introduced in the kinetics equation equation and equation , to simulate the air flow around the snowflake during its fall from clouds @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> besides , this approach is not restricted to snowflake growth . the developed approach opens a new way to answer numerous outstanding questions concerning dendritic growth in wide range of materials . </S>",
    "<S> we can cite , for instance , the faceted dendritic growth observed in pure isotactic polystyrene films , or the snowflake - like growth of graphene monocrystal @xcite . </S>"
