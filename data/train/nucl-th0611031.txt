    "self - consistent mean - field models are one of the standard approaches in nuclear structure theory , see ref.@xcite for a recent review . for heavy nuclei , they are the only microscopic method that can be systematically applied on a large scale .    over the last few years , we were involved in the development of a method , that adds long - range correlations to self - consistent mean - field by projection after variation and variational configuration mixing within the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) . a pedagogical introduction to our method",
    "is given in ref.@xcite , we will sketch some of our recent work on those aspects of this method that concern the treatment of pairing correlations .",
    "for an introduction into the treatment of pairing correlations in a hfb framework , see for example@xcite and references given therein . we will give only those details that are relevant for the further discussion .",
    "all results given below were obtained with the effective skyrme interaction sly4@xcite and a density - dependent pairing interaction with a soft cutoff at 5 mev above and below the fermi energy as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the hfb equations are solved using the two - basis method introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "all we need to know about an hfb state in what follows is that in its canonical basis it is given by @xmath0 in terms of occupation probabilities and creation and annihilation operators .",
    "hfb states are not eigenstates of the particle - number operator . in condensed matter ,",
    "for which hfb theory was originally designed , this is not much of a problem , as the number of particles is usually huge . in nuclear physics , where the particle number is quite small , this causes two problems : on the one hand , the standard hfb treatment artificially breaks down when the density of single - particle levels around the fermi energy is below a critical value , leading to a hf state without pairing correlations . on the other hand , a hfb state mixes the wave functions of different nuclei as it is spread in particle - number space , with a width that is proportional to the dispersion of the particle number@xcite .",
    "variation after projection ( vap)@xcite provides a rigorous solution to both problems . for various mainly technical reasons , however , this approach is not yet widely used ( see@xcite for an exception ) .",
    "we use a different approach instead , that was first outlined in ref.@xcite . in a first step , we complement the hfb equation with the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) method , that provides a numerically simple approximation to projection before variation , see ref.@xcite and references given therein for details . the ln procedure enforces the presence of pairing correlations also in the weak pairing regime at small level density . the ln method gives a correction to the total energy whose quality has been repeatedly questioned .",
    "we do not make use of the correction term , but project in a second step on exact eigenstates of the particle - number operator @xmath1 , with eigenvalue @xmath2 , applying the particle - number projection operator @xmath3 the operator @xmath4 rotates the hfb state in a @xmath5 gauge space @xmath6 while @xmath7 is a weight function . for states with",
    "even particle number @xmath2 the integration interval can be reduced to @xmath8 $ ] .",
    "we discretize the integrals over the gauge angle with a simple @xmath9-point trapezoidal formula @xmath10 as was shown by fomenko@xcite , this simple scheme eliminates exactly all components from an hfb state which differ from the desired particle number @xmath2 by up to @xmath11 particles .",
    "although the spread of the near - gaussian distribution of particle numbers is large in comparison with respect to the constrained value , it is small enough that already small values of @xmath9 , ranging from 5 in light nuclei to 13 in heavy ones , are sufficient for the numerical convergence of the integrals over @xmath12 .    in practice , we constrain the hfb states in the mean - field calculations to the same ( integer ) particle number that we project on afterwards .",
    "this is , however , not a necessary condition . in a projection - before - variation",
    "approach , the particle number of the intrinsic state has no physical meaning , and will usually take a non - integer value close to , but not identical with , the particle number projected on@xcite .",
    "we address here only hfb states with pairing correlations among particles of the same isospin . in this case ,",
    "the nuclear hfb state is the direct product of separate hfb states for protons and neutrons , respectively , which are separately projected afterwards on the number of the respective particle species .      in a mean - field calculation",
    ", one often encounters a situation where the total binding energy ( mean field or projected ) varies only slowly with a collective degree of freedom .",
    "in such a case , it can be expected that the nuclear wave function is widely spread around the mean - field minimum , which is beyond the scope of ( projected ) mean - field theory .",
    "these fluctuations around a single state can be incorporated within the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "the mixed projected many - body state is set - up as a coherent superposition of projected mean - field states @xmath13 which differ in one or several collective coordinates @xmath14 @xmath15 the weight function @xmath16 is determined from the stationarity of the gcm ground state , which leads to the hill - wheeler - griffin equation@xcite @xmath17 \\ ; f_{k } ( q ' )   = 0 , \\ ] ] that gives a correlated ground state , and , in addition , a spectrum of excited states from orthogonalization to the ground state .",
    "the weight functions @xmath16 are not orthonormal .",
    "a set of orthonormal collective wave functions in the basis of the states @xmath13 is obtained from a transformation involving the square root of the norm kernel@xcite .",
    "it has to be noted that projection is in fact a special case of the gcm , where degenerate states are mixed .",
    "the generators of the group involved define the collective path , and the weight functions are determined by the restored symmetry .    for a state which would result from the mixing of different unprojected mean - field states",
    ", the mean particle number will not not be equal to the particle number of the original mean - field states anymore .",
    "projection on particle - number , as done here , eliminates this problem , otherwise a constraint on the particle number has to be added to the hill - wheeler - griffin equation ( [ eq : hwg ] ) , see , for example , ref.@xcite .",
    "the technical challenges of a configuration - mixing calculation come from the non - diagonal kernels of different mean - field states , which are evaluated with a generalized wick theorem@xcite .",
    "we represent the single - particle states on a 3-dimensional mesh in coordinate space using a lagrange mesh technique@xcite . as a consequence , the two sets of single - particle states representing the intrinsic hfb states entering the kernels are usually not equivalent , which has to be carefully taken into account@xcite .",
    "we usually combine the techniques presented above with a projection on angular momentum@xcite that will not be discussed here .",
    "applications are published in refs.@xcite .",
    "similar methods , but without particle - number projection , have been set up using the gogny force@xcite and relativistic lagrangians@xcite .    for the sake of simple notation , we have introduced the gcm using a many - body hamiltonian @xmath18 .",
    "all the methods just mentioned , however , have in common that they are not based on a hamiltonian , but an energy functional to calculate the binding energy .",
    "the necessary generalization will be sketched in section [ sect : divergence ] below .",
    "there is fundamental problem with projection after variation as performed here : it can not be expected that the projection of the mean - field ground state ( after variation ) gives the minimum of the energy hyper - surface that is obtained by the projection of all possible mean - field states ( which would be found by projection before variation ) .",
    "when projecting deformed mean - field states on angular - momentum , the intrinsic deformation of the mean - field ground state will indeed usually be different from the intrinsic deformation of the state giving the minimum of the projected energy curve , with the the exception of well - deformed heavy nuclei in the rare - earth , actinide , and transactinide regions .    in the context of angular - momentum projection",
    ", we overcome this problem to some extend by a minimization after projection ( map ) , where we generate an energy curve of projected mean - field states with different intrinsic quadrupole deformation , whose minimum provides a first order approximation to projection before variation .",
    "when performing a gcm calculation of projected states , the spacing of points along this deformation energy curve does not need to be very dense , it even does not have to contain the actual minimum , as the variational projected gcm calculation of two ( non - orthogonal ) projected states around a minimum has the ability to ( implicitely ) construct this minimum , as the projected state representing the minimum has a non - zero overlap with the actually used states . as the projected gcm ground state also describes the energy gain from fluctuations around this minimum , its energy will be even below that of the minimum of the projected energy curve .",
    "it has to be stressed that the correlations from fluctuations around the projected state are outside the scope of projection before variation . as a consequence ,",
    "projection before variation does not _",
    "per se _ give a better description of correlations beyond the mean field than a gcm of states projected after variation .",
    "while this is a standard procedure in the context of angular - momentum projection , where a map is performed with respect to quadrupole deformation , it has been rarely addressed in connection with particle - number projection .",
    "the most obvious degree of freedom to search for a minimum of a particle - number projected energy curve is the amount of pairing correlations contained in the ( unprojected ) intrinsic state .",
    "using this degree of freedom in a projected gcm calculation is equivalent to including the ground - state correlations from pairing vibrations ( see refs.@xcite for an overview and refs.@xcite for early gcm calculations using schematic models ) .",
    "exploratory studies along these lines within the context of realistic mean - field models are presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "they do , however , not involve projection on angular momentum .",
    "we will present here a similar study of the role of dynamical pairing correlations in @xmath19sn .",
    "first of all , we have to note that finding a suitable constraint on pairing correlations is not an easy task .",
    "the obvious choice in schematic models is the pairing gap obtained from a pairing force with constant matrix elements .",
    "this coordinate was , in fact , also used in refs.@xcite .",
    "it has , however , some serious drawbacks as this pairing force leads to unrealistic asymptotics of the hfb state at large distances from the nucleus@xcite .",
    "constraints on other observables that measure pairing correlations pose similar problems even when used with a realistic pairing interaction , or they introduce ambiguities on how to put them into the variational equations@xcite .",
    "the situation is similar to a constraint on a multipole moment of the density distribution of order @xmath20 used to generate an energy surface as a function of deformation .",
    "such a constraint has always to be damped at large distances from the nucleus , as it introduces along some direction a contribution to the constrained single - particle potential that diverges as @xmath21 .",
    "hfb and hfb - ln mean - field energy curves , the latter with and without the ln correction term in the energy , and particle - number projected energy curves as a function of the `` generating pairing strength '' @xmath22 for a spherical mean - field state in @xmath19sn .",
    "the dots with horizontal bars represent the energy of the projected gcm ground state plotted at its average `` generating pairing strength '' .",
    "the energy scale on the left is normalized with respect to the hf ground state , while the scale to the right gives the total binding energy . ]",
    "a not completely satisfactory , but well working constraint on the amount of pairing correlations is provided by the strength of the pairing force .",
    "a calculation is done in two steps : first , the hfb or hfb - ln equations are solved using a `` generating pairing strength '' @xmath22 .",
    "then , in a second step , the energy of each hfb state is re - calculated without iterating the hfb equations using the realistic pairing strength @xmath23 mev @xmath24 , either with or without projection . in a third step",
    ", the projected hfb states can be mixed within the gcm .",
    "only the pairing strength of the neutrons is changed . for protons",
    ", we always use @xmath23 mev @xmath24 , and the same method as for the decription of the neutrons ; in the case of pure hfb this means that the proton pairing breaks down .",
    "an example of such a calculation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sn120 ] . the most remarkable findings are    \\1 ) the hfb equations without ln corrections break down to hf at values of the pairing strength around @xmath25 mev @xmath24 . for those states",
    ", our formalism can not introduce pairing correlations beyond the mean - field . just above the transition from an unpaired to a paired system ,",
    "the energy gain from projection rises very rapidly up to about the @xmath22 corresponding to the minimum of the energy curve ( which differes on the order of 10 @xmath26 from @xmath27 ) , and decreases more slowly afterwards .",
    "this is analogue to what is found in the angular - momentum projection of quadrupole deformed states around a spherical configuration .",
    "\\2 ) there are obvious differences between hfb and hfb - ln energy curves , both on the mean - field level and projected , for small generating pairing strength @xmath28 mev @xmath24 , which is indeed in the regime of the physical pairing strength . in the strong pairing regime at larger values of @xmath22 , the energy curves obtained from projection of the hfb and hfb - ln states are nearly identical .",
    "the remaining difference might be attributed to the presence of proton pairing correlations in the hfb - ln case , while they are absent for hfb .",
    "\\3 ) the ln correction overestimates the energy gain from projection at small generating pairing strength , and underestimates it in the strong pairing regime .",
    "\\4 ) the additional energy gain from the gcm of projected states is quite small , around 100 kev when starting with hfb - ln states , and about 200 kev for pure hfb states .",
    "the unphysical breakdown of hfb in the weak pairing regime leads to a smaller binding energy at the minimum of the projected energy curve , and gives a potential energy surface that is stiffer than the hfb - ln one for small @xmath22 .",
    "this leads to a gcm ground state from projected hfb that is less bound than the gcm gound state from projected hfb - ln .",
    "this also pushes the gcm ground state wave function from projected hfb to larger values of @xmath22 than the one from projected hfb - ln , as seen from the larger average generating pairing strength @xmath29 in the projected hfb case .",
    "this calculation , of course , scratches only on the surface of the importance of dynamical pairing correlations .",
    "the question of better constraints on pairing correlations , systematics , excited states , and the coupling with deformation modes will be addressed elsewhere .",

    "it has been noticed for a long time that the particle - number projected energy might exhibit divergences@xcite when a single - particle level crosses the fermi energy and has the occupation .",
    "more recently , it was pointed out by stoitsov _ et al._@xcite , that in addition to the divergence there appears a finite step in the projected energy when passing this situation as a function of a constraint .",
    "an example is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : o18:sly4 ] , where two clear divergences appear when a fine discretization of the integral over gauge angles , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fomenko ] ) , is used .",
    "the steps are also hinted , with the binding energy changing on both sides from a lower curve around sphericity to a higher lying curve when passing the divergence .",
    "first of all , it has to be stressed that the binding energy is the only observable that shows an anomaly when a single - particle level crosses the fermi energy .",
    "neither the overlap , nor any observable calculated from any @xmath34-body operator shows an unusual behaviour .",
    "this is examplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : o18:sly4 ] by the dispersion of the particle number , a two - body operator that also provides a measure for the numerical quality of projection . for a small system like @xmath30o ,",
    "the integrals over gauge angles are already numerically converged for discretization points .",
    "the only exception is the binding energy .",
    "however , an extremely huge number of discretization points is needed to see the divergence develop in @xmath30o ( and even more for heavier nuclei ) , which is one of the reasons why the divergence often remains undetected .",
    "the other reason is that it is very unlikely that one of the discrete points used to calculate a potential energy surface hits the narrow region where the divergence appears .",
    "this is different when performing projection before variation , where the variation will detect the divergences more easily@xcite .",
    "the appearance of a divergence for the binding energy , but no other observable is related to the the particular definition of the binding energy in our method : the energy is calculated from an energy density functional , while everything else is , for the moment at least , calculated as the expectation value of an operator .",
    "to understand the origin of the divergence , we have to look into the definition and evaluation of the energy functional . for the sake of simple notation and a transparent argument",

    "when evaluating the hamiltonian kernel ( [ eq : eproj : h ] ) by commutating the creation and annihilation operators of the hamiltonian with those setting up the hfb states until they hit the vacuum , it becomes clear that each pair of conjugated particles @xmath64 can be multiplied with one @xmath65 factor stemming from the rotated state to the right only , and that the possible combinations of @xmath61 and @xmath66 for a given @xmath67 will always be bilinear . only when the wick theorem is applied , one obtains terms which are of 4th order in @xmath61 and @xmath66 and quadratic in @xmath65 .",
    "the reason is that multiple contributions from the same particle or pair of particles are not excluded from the sum as the wick theorem implicitely assumes that the matrix elements these terms multiply are zero or sum up to zero , so that they will not contribute anyway . in an edf",
    "these matrix elements are not zero anymore , but the wick theorem is still used .    one rigorous way to remove the spurious terms from an energy functional would be to remove all possible self - interactions in the total energy by excluding that the same summation index appears more than once in a contribution to eq .",

    "this leads , however , to enourmous complications in the variational equations , particularly when extended to density - dependent interactions .      as pointed out by stoitsov _",

    "the two additional contributions to the projected energy are huge ( on the order of several hundered mev for @xmath30o ) , but of opposite sign and nearly , but not exactly , canceling each other .",
    "the step appears when one of the poles at @xmath69 enters or leaves the integration contour when the single - particle energy of the corresponding particle crosses the fermi energy .",
    "density - dependent terms add further complications to the divergence , which we will not address here in detail .",
    "let us just comment that , first , in a projected theory , the evaluation of a density - dependent term with non - integer power requires the evaluation of a ( multivalued ) root of a complex number , which leaves the riemann sheet for choice .",

    "the particle - hole and particle - particle channel of the effective interaction sum up different classes of diagrams@xcite , which inevitably leads to different expressions for the effective interaction in both channels .",
    "short - range correlations are resummed into the functional providing the two channels with different density - dependent forms . on the other hand ,",
    "the long - range correlations from large - amplitude fluctuations around the mean - field states are either neglected in a pure mean - field approach when they are assumed to be small , or otherwise described explicitely by projection and gcm - type configuration mixing .",
    "a correction that removes the divergent part and the finite step from the projected energy can be set - up when identifying the terms with an unphysical dependence on the gauge angle comparing the expressions obtained from the standard and generalized wick theorem@xcite .",
    "while particle - number projection is the prominent example for the appearance of a divergence , similar divergences can be expected in any gcm calculation or projection on any other quantum number . as in these cases",
    "the mixed states have different canonical bases , the transition density matrix is usually not diagonal and the analysis is less obvious .",
    "the widely used collective schrdinger equation and bohr hamiltonian that are set - up through a series of approximations ( at some points including improvements ) from exact configuration mixing can not be expected to be free of problems stemming from the divergence either , although there they will be more difficult to identify .",
    "first , we have examined for the example of @xmath19sn the effect of a minimization after particle - number projection and of gcm ground state correlations from pairing vibrations . for @xmath19sn ,",
    "the effect is visible , but not enormous , and clearly smaller than the current uncertainties from the parameterization of the effective pairing interaction .",
    "this might be , however , different for other nuclei .",
    "second , we have examined the divergence that appears in particle - number projected edf .",
    "as its origin we identify the spurious self - pairing contribution contained in all common energy functionals for self - consistent mean - field models .",
    "on the mean - field level , the self - pairing as such adds a small spurious contribution to the total binding energy , that is similar to , but smaller , than the usual spurious centre - of - mass or rotational energies from broken symmetries ( in fact , together with the self - energy it is the spurious energy from violating the pauli principle in approximate edf approaches ) .",
    "when generalizing the edf to particle number projection via the generalized wick theorem , the self - pairing provides the hamiltonian kernels with an unphysical dependence on the gauge angle , which ultimately leads to divergences and steps .",
