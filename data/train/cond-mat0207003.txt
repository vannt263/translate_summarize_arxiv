    "the interstitial order was found to disappear at 317  k.    the interstitial order lowers the symmetry of the lattice , and provides a modulated potential that can pin charge stripes.@xcite the absence of a clear disordering transition for the charge stripes is consistent with order induced by a symmetry - breaking field , as occurs in the case of a ferromagnet warmed in an applied magnetic field to temperatures above its curie point .",

    "of course , the mir peak is still present when the putative gap goes to zero , and the system never becomes a truly metallic conductor , so it is difficult to see how a conventional cdw picture could be applied .",
    "any self - consistent interpretation of the mir peak must take into account the fact that the doped holes tend to order as stripes .",
    "furthermore , the stripe solid melts into a stripe liquid above the charge - ordering temperature,@xcite and so should still have observable effects on the charge excitations at higher temperatures .",

    "[ fg : dos](b ) ] , the lattice does not have time to relax . as a result , the required excitation energy must be increased beyond the minimum electronic energy by twice the lattice - relaxation energy : once in removing the electron from the antiferromagnetic region and again in adding the electron to a charge stripe .",
    "this increase in the excitation energy is known as the franck - condon effect .",
    "we would expect this `` polaronic '' energy to appear as a shift of the excitations in the ordered state relative to that in the stripe - liquid state .",

    "thermal excitations of charge carriers into the mid - gap states would be limited by this minimum gap ; excitations at the mir peak frequency are not relevant for thermal processes .",
    "if a gap of order @xmath66 is present at low temperature in @xmath67 , it is masked by the phonon conductivity ; nevertheless , the drude conductivity and the dc resistivity should be sensitive to such a gap .    the drude conductivity is shown in fig .  [ fg:2](b ) .",

    "this is consistent with our argument that the shift @xmath74 results from the franck - condon effect . but",
    "how does the temperature dependence of the energy shift compare with the actual lattice displacements ?    the intensity of a charge - order superlattice peak measured by neutron diffraction is proportional to the square of the lattice displacement . in fig .",
    "[ fg:2](c ) we have plotted the square - root of such an intensity measurement.@xcite ( the choice of taking the square - root was made to enhance the signal at higher temperatures . ) the gradual decrease in the shift energy above the 110-k transition is qualitatively consistent with the decay in magnitude of the lattice displacements . the contrasting behavior observed by katsufuji _ et al._@xcite in la@xmath9sr@xmath10nio@xmath5 , where the energy - shift was found to exhibit a bcs - like temperature dependence , corresponds with the critical behavior observed in the superlattice intensities by diffraction studies on that compound.@xcite    the feature in fig .  [ fg:2 ] that , on first glance , seems inconsistent is the jump in superlattice intensity at the 110-k spin ordering transition ",
    "it is certainly not reflected in the optical energy shift .",
    "the discrepancy becomes less significant when one realizes that local lattice displacements are not the only factor involved in stabilizing the charge stripes . at the first - order 110-k transition",
    ", there is a jump in the ordering wave vector at the transition ; the charge stripes are commensurate with the interstitial lattice above the transition , but become effectively incommensurate below.@xcite in the commensurate phase , the stripes are stabilized by alignment with the coulomb potential of the interstitials , in addition to the local lattice relaxation . in the incommensurate phase at lower temperatures , the coulomb stabilization is lost , but the incommensurate phase is favored by the reduction in energy from the ordering of the magnetic moments . in terms of screening the charge stripes , the loss of the interstitial coulomb energy is balanced by the increase in lattice displacements .",
    "thus , it seems reasonable that the energy shift of the mir peak is insensitive to the transition at 110  k.    the magnitude of the mir peak shift we observe is comparable to that found in  with @xmath47 ( ref .  ) and @xmath76 ( ref .  ) , where the stripe order is incommensurate.@xcite in contrast , the shift is larger ( 0.26 ev ) for the @xmath42 composition , where the order is commensurate.@xcite in the commensurate case , it seems likely that the lattice displacements and the coulomb energy work together , resulting in an enhanced franck - condon energy .",
    "finally , we note that the electronic dynamical conductivity along the @xmath12 axis ( see inset of fig .  [ fg : reflc ] ) remains negligible at all temperatures .",
    "this result provides credibility to our assumption that the electronic excitations probed with @xmath77 are confined within the two - dimensional nio@xmath0 planes .",
    "the insulating behavior along the @xmath12-axis together with finite conductivity within the planes is reminiscent of cuprate superconductors in the pseudogap regime.@xcite",
    "we have presented a study of the optical conductivity in la@xmath0nio@xmath19 . while the data are qualitatively similar to those reported for , we have introduced a new interpretation of the electronic conductivity . in particular , we have shown that @xmath78 can be decomposed into the mir peak , a contribution that is always gapped , and a drude component that appears at higher temperatures .",

    "the charge stripes are mid - gap states that , in the case of nickelates , are empty at low temperature .",

    "the temperature - dependent frequency shift of the mir peak is consistent with a franck - condon effect that is dependent on the degree of stripe order .",
    "the electronic structure associated with stripes is inhomogeneous in real space .",

    "the connection between stripe fluctuations and conductivity ( or hole motion ) has been explored in a number of theoretical studies of stripe models relevant to the cuprates.@xcite for the insulating stripes in the nickelates , finite conductivity correlates with disordering of the stripes .",
    "the charge stripes in cuprates are partially filled with electrons , so that drude - like conduction should be possible even when the stripes are ordered .",
