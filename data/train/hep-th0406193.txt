    "studies of interactions between d - branes and closed strings are quite important from various points of view . the interactions play a crucial role in finding non - trivial relationships between open strings and closed strings such as ads / cft @xcite and recently - proposed open - closed dualities @xcite , for example .",
    "studies of the interactions are also important to analyze the dynamics of the systems of multiple d - branes .",
    "however , almost all analyses of the interactions have been carried out by considering static d - branes , and it is a long - standing problem to describe the back reaction of the d - branes .",
    "a d - brane in the worldsheet description is just a boundary of the worldsheet with dirichlet boundary condition , and the d - brane is treated as an infinitely heavy classical source of closed strings ; the position , or the collective coordinate , of the d - brane is fixed at a point in the target space in the dirichlet direction .",
    "there are several attempts to describe the back reaction of d - branes .",
    "some of them are based on the conformal field theory on the worldsheet @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the disk amplitude for the scattering of closed string states from a d - particle is computed in the bosonic string theory in which the collective coordinate of the d - particle is quantized .",
    "the current conservation condition of the d - particle is obtained by demanding the conformal invariance of the amplitude in that work .",
    "momentum conservation condition between the closed strings and the d - particle is described by using the zero - mode integral in the path integral of the trajectory of the d - particle .",
    "attempts to obtain the momentum conservation condition between closed strings and a d - brane from the viewpoint of conformal invariance can be found in refs .",
    "an annulus amplitude for the scattering of the closed strings from the d - brane is considered and a variant of the fischler - susskind mechanism is proposed there ; the infrared ( ir ) divergence in the open string channel of the annulus amplitude is canceled by adding an appropriate operator to the boundary of the worldsheet .",
    "the momentum conservation condition between the closed strings and the d - particle is explicitly obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite by demanding the conformal invariance of the total amplitude . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ir divergence is canceled by adding a logarithmic operator @xcite that represents the recoil of the d - particle @xcite .",
    "however , it is also pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that the divergence does not exist in the case of d@xmath0-brane with @xmath1 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the energy conservation condition is also obtained as well as the momentum conservation condition in the case of d - particle , explicitly . however , there is still room to clarify how to define the initial momentum of the d - particle there .",
    "further investigation along the ideas of refs .",
    "@xcite is still important for deeper understanding of recoil of d - branes .",
    "some applications of d - brane recoil to other topics , and related works are found in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a target - space theory that handles second - quantized closed strings with dynamical d - branes may provide us a description of back reaction of d - branes .",
    "some arguments on back reaction and recoil of d - branes along this approach is found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we propose an alternative method to describe the scattering process between a d - brane and closed strings together with the back reaction of the d - brane in the bosonic string theory .",
    "the impact of the closed strings in this method is represented by a source term of the low - energy effective worldvolume theory of the d - brane , and the initial and the final velocity of the d - brane are described by the time derivative of the expectation values of the massless scalar fields of the worldvolume theory .",
    "we utilize the following approximations to justify our approach :    1 .",
    "field theory limit , namely @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the typical momentum of the open strings on the d - brane .",
    "elastic limit , namely the momenta of the closed strings are small enough and no massive open - string mode is excited on the d - brane .",
    "we also assume that the closed strings do not lose their total momentum in the worldvolume directions of the d - brane , and no internal field on the d - brane gets momentum from the closed strings .",
    "non - relativistic limit , namely the velocity of the d - brane is very small .",
    "tree level approximation in the string theory , namely the string coupling is very small .    the above conditions 3 and 4 means that the tension of the d - brane is very large .",
    "this is also consistent with the condition 1 .",
    "a nontrivial problem is how to represent the source term of the worldvolume theory in terms of the quantities of the closed strings .",
    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "we consider a scattering process between the d - brane and the closed strings that creates @xmath4 massless scalar particles on the worldvolume of the d - brane .",
    "we calculate the probability of the creation of the @xmath4 massless scalar particles in the two different frameworks : one of them is the worldvolume theory of the d - brane with the source term and the other is the perturbative string theory . by comparing the two results , we obtain the relationship between the source term and the momenta of the closed strings , and we obtain the momentum conservation condition between the closed strings and the d - brane up to the relative sign of the momentum of the d - brane .",
    "one of the distinction between the present work and those in refs .",
    "@xcite is that all the diagrams we consider in the string theory are disk diagrams and we need not annulus diagrams .",
    "the organization of this article is as follows .",
    "we consider bosonic strings , and we start by considering a recoiling d - particle for simplicity . in section 2 , we consider the worldvolume theory of the d - particle and review some basic facts necessary for the later discussions .",
    "we calculate the amplitude of the creation of the @xmath4 massless particles explicitly . in section 3",
    ", we consider the scattering process between the d - particle and the closed strings and calculate the amplitude of the process that creates @xmath4 massless open string modes on the d - particle in the framework of the string theory . in section 4",
    ", we compare the results obtained in section 2 with those in section 3 .",
    "we show that the absolute value of the total momentum transfer from the closed strings is exactly equal to the absolute value of the change of the d - particle s momentum , within the above approximations",
    ". we also comment on the distribution of the probability of the @xmath4 massless particle creation .",
    "we see that the expectation value of the total energy of the created particles gives the kinetic energy of the d - particle , correctly . in section 5",
    ", we generalize the results obtained for the d - particle to the case of higher dimensional d - branes .",
    "we compactify the worldvolume of the d - brane to make its mass finite , and we obtain the momentum conservation condition between the closed strings and the d - brane up to the relative sign of the momentum of the d - brane , again .",
    "we provide conclusion , several open problems and discussions in the last section .",
    "we begin with the dirac - born - infelt ( dbi ) action of a d - particle .",
    "it is just an ordinary action for a point particle : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the tension of the d - particle , and @xmath7 denotes the time derivative of the space coordinate @xmath8 of the d - particle .",
    "we consider a _ non - relativistic _ d - particle in this work .",
    "then @xmath9 and the dbi action is written as @xmath10 where we have dropped the constant term and the @xmath11 contributions .",
    "next , we consider a scattering process between the d - particle and closed strings .",
    "we attempt to include the effects of the closed strings in the above action .",
    "a simple conjecture is that a source term may effectively represent the impact of the closed strings .",
    "therefore , we consider the following effective action @xmath12 and let us examine how this action represents the nature of the recoiling d - particle . here , @xmath13 is an ir cut - off that should be sent to zero finally , and we assume that @xmath14 includes relevant effects of the closed strings .      let us calculate the time dependence of the expectation value of @xmath8 at the classical level .",
    "we choose the target space coordinate so that the initial momentum of the d - particle is equal to zero and its final momentum is in the @xmath15 direction .",
    "we assume that the source term is switched on only for the duration @xmath16 .",
    "the expectation value of the field @xmath17 is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the retarded green s function which satisfies @xmath20 and @xmath21 satisfies the equation of motion without the source term , @xmath22 @xmath23 is the initial velocity of the d - particle and @xmath24 , in fact . substituting the explicit form of the retarded green s function , @xmath25 where we should take the limit @xmath26 .",

    "@xmath32 the limit @xmath26 should be taken before we take the limit @xmath33 .",
    "note that @xmath34 is real .",
    "@xmath35 should be regarded as the duration of that the closed strings affect the d - particle in the scattering process .",
    "we assume that the effects of the closed strings disappear at the infinitely far future and we define the final velocity of the d - particle @xmath36 in this region ( @xmath31 ) . in the same way",
    ", we assume that the effects of the closed strings disappears at the infinitely past and the initial velocity of the d - particle @xmath37 should be defined in the region of @xmath38 .",
    "then , the change of the velocity of the d - particle is given by @xmath39 , and the problem we should consider is how to rewrite @xmath34 in terms of the quantities of the closed strings .",
    "we will come back to this problem in section [ conservation - section ] .",
    "we calculate the @xmath4 particle creation amplitude with the source term in order to compare it with the corresponding amplitude in the string theory .",
    "we treat the source term as a perturbation .",
    "the action without the source term is @xmath40 we consider only @xmath17 and we define a dimension - less field @xmath41 as @xmath42 .",

    "@xmath55 is a real number defined in ( [ theta ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath56 gives a poisson distribution where @xmath57 , and the final state is a coherent state .",
    "the detailed calculation to obtain ( [ a - field ] ) is reviewed in appendix [ n - parti - amp ] .",
    "in this section , we calculate the amplitude of the creation of the @xmath4 massless scalar open strings on the d - particle from @xmath58 closed strings , at the tree level .",
    "we choose the spacetime coordinate so that the d - particle recoils in the @xmath15 direction as we did in section [ field ] , and the massless open strings we consider here correspond to the zero mode of the d - particle in the @xmath15 direction . direction .",

    "the amplitude consists of several disk diagrams as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] , for example .",
    "we calculate a single disk amplitude to begin with , and we consider the full diagrams by using the results on the single disk amplitude .",
    "we calculate a disk amplitude @xmath59 of @xmath58 closed strings and @xmath4 massless scalar open strings on the d - particle .",
    "we consider a unit disk @xmath60 with neumann boundary condition @xmath61 and dirichlet boundary conditions @xmath62 for @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the complex coordinate on the unit disk .",
    "we explicitly calculate for the case that all the closed strings are closed - string tachyons , for simplicity , however the results should be easily generalized to the cases of arbitrary closed strings .",
    "the open strings can not carry momenta in the dirichlet directions and thus their momenta in the space directions are zero .",
    "the energy of the massless open string is also zero due to the on - shell condition .",
    "therefore , the massless open string labeled by @xmath65 is represented by the vertex operator @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the polarization vector which satisfies @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",

    "note that the momentum conservation condition among the strings appears due to the zero - mode integral .",
    "we do not have the momentum conservation condition among the strings in the dirichlet directions due to lack of the zero - mode integral and thus @xmath103 is allowed .      in this case",

    "we will fix the position of the open - string vertex labeled by @xmath105 as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is a fixed value .",

    "this corresponds to divide the amplitude by @xmath112 .",
    "now we have fixed the position of the closed string vertex and the @xmath81-coordinate of the marked point on the disk .",
    "thus the faddeev - popov determinant is the same as the case we have more than one vertex ; it is @xmath114 . as a result , we obtain ( [ identif ] ) .",

    "all the closed - string vertices we have used in the calculations are closed - string tachyon vertices , however we can easily find that ( [ fact - amp - pre ] ) holds for arbitrary closed strings if we regard @xmath59 as the disk amplitude of the corresponding @xmath58 closed strings and the @xmath4 massless open strings .",
    "now we can calculate the total amplitude of the creation of the @xmath4 massless scalar open strings by using the results obtained in the previous subsection .",
    "we define the total amplitude as @xmath116 . for simplicity , we demonstrate the calculation of the amplitude in the case of @xmath117 and @xmath118 that is given schematically in fig .",

    "for example , the exact momentum conservation condition for a d - particle , @xmath188 fixes the relative phase between the amplitudes in the field theory and those in the string theory as @xmath189 in our notation . we can also obtain a similar condition between the amplitudes for a d@xmath0-brane .",
    "the new relationship between the amplitudes like ( [ abs - amp - comp ] ) can be a starting point of solving the open problems .",
    "we hope that the present work can be a step to the deeper understanding of the interactions between d - branes and closed strings .    *",
