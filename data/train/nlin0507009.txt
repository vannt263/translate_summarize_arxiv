    "the macroscopic pattern exhibited by a bacterial colony and its dependence on certain environmental parameters can give us some clues about the coordinated colonization strategy followed by the community of cells .",
    "the biological interest in this interdisciplinary area is in pointing out under controlled laboratory conditions the cooperative mechanisms ( intercellular interactions , motility and communications ) that these bacteria , which are traditionally considered as solitary life forms , may have developed to adapt to changing environments .",
    "it is an extremely fertile and interesting area for close collaboration between physicists and biologists because it helps both to understand the transition from individual ( uni - cellular , a bacteria ) to collective ( multi - cellular , a colony ) behavior @xcite .",
    "bacterial colony pattern formation on semi - solid agar surfaces has been studied extensively by microbiologists and physicists @xcite . through these works undertaken with colonies arising from different species and strains of bacteria ,",
    "the following common features have been described : bacteria can swim in liquid medium without difficulty but in environments with adverse conditions for the swimming motility , they need to develop mechanisms to become more motile . on semi - solid agar medium , where the viscosity is high and the motility of short swimmer cells very low , some may differentiate into very elongated , multinucleated and profusely flagellated swarm cells that can move easier @xcite .",
    "the initiation of swarm differentiation seems to be strictly correlated with physico - chemical factors such as surface contact and quorum sensing response ( cell density sensing mechanism ) @xcite .",
    "swarming cells have the ability to extract water from the agar and produce a lubrication fluid ( slime ) .",
    "the flagellum driven motility of swarmer cells together with the extracellular slime helps to overcome the surface friction @xcite . after some time migrating swarmer cells",
    "have been observed to cease movement , septate and produce groups of swimmer cells ( de - differentiation process ) @xcite .",
    "the chemotaxis system is essential for swarming motility in _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite . with the chemotaxis mechanism bacteria can orient their motion in response to a gradient ( positive or negative ) of a certain chemical field ( a nutrient or a field produced by the bacterial cells such as chemical signals or a ph change ) @xcite .",
    "based on these experimental observations great effort has been devoted to model the cooperative behavior of a cell community @xcite .",
    "here we describe the new pattern and pattern transitions observed in a swarming colony of _",
    "@xcite , a laboratory domesticated wild type strain that produces a lubricating fluid or slime : when the colonial motility is limited this colony expands irregularly with few relatively thick , dense , branches and very rare secondary branches , whereas for conditions of improved colonial motility the pattern is compact and round with structures of higher cell densities . to study the coordinated , self - organized , colonization scheme of this colony and based on experimental microscopic observations , we will define a mathematical model of the cooperative behavior of this colony which is able to predict the pattern transitions when certain control parameters are changed .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in section [ exper ] we will introduce the experimental results and their implications for the non - expert reader . then in section",
    "[ model ] , our hypothesis for the collective dynamics will be explained , followed by a mathematical formulation .",
    "results of the computer simulation in comparisons with experiments will be posed and discussed in section [ val ] .",
    "the summary and conclusions are given in section [ conclu ] .",
    "the development of an _ e. coli _ mg1655 colony on a semi - solid surface ( @xmath1 `` difco '' agar ) under certain nutritional ( 1@xmath2 `` difco '' tryptone , 0.5@xmath2 `` difco '' yeast extract , 0.5@xmath2 nacl and @xmath1 d-(+)-glucose ) and environmental ( at @xmath3c and on average @xmath4 relative humidity ) conditions has been studied in detail with round and square laboratory plates of @xmath5 and @xmath6 cm respectively .",
    "we inoculated a @xmath7 liquid drop of stationary phase bacteria cultivated overnight ( in lb , @xcite , at @xmath3c ) .",
    "the following experimental observations were made :    * the colony expands on the surface in a compact and round shape with few ( typically 6 to 8) wide branches .",
    "the colonization of the plate takes place very rapidly : at @xmath8c a plate of 9 cm diameter is colonized in roughly one day , see fig .",
    "[ ecoliflor](a ) . *",
    "it was observed that the fronts of two colonies inoculated on the same plate never merge unless they meet tangentially .",
    "branches do not simply grow radially from their inoculation point , but avoid this intercolonial demarcation region , see fig .",
    "[ ecoliflor](b ) . *",
    "the term `` swarming '' is used in the literature to describe the active , flagellar - dependent surface motility of bacteria @xcite . to confirm the relevance of flagella in the mechanisms of surface translocation of this colony we have constructed by p1 transduction @xcite a flagellar - defective mutant , mg1655 _ flhd_::kan @xcite",
    ". the _ flhdc _",
    "operon encodes a key master regulator of the hierarchical system controlling the synthesis of the bacterial flagellum in _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite . having this operon inactivated the strain mg1655 _ flhd_::kan",
    "can thus not synthesize the bacterial flagella .",
    "the wild type and the flagellar - defective mutant were inoculated simultaneously .",
    "after one day the mutant had initiated expansion over the surface , due to the combined influence of the expansive forces of bacterial growth ( population pressure ) and the fluid production .",
    "but , in contrast with the wild type mg1655 , it failed to continue the rapid surface colonization , see fig .",
    "[ ecoliflor](c ) .",
    "the slow passive form of surface translocation displayed by the mutant is called `` spreading '' @xcite .",
    "the same pattern was also observed when the flagellar - defective mutant was inoculated alone on a plate and for lower agar concentration ( data not shown ) .",
    "notice also the existence of a clear asymmetric intercolonial demarcation region which has been avoided by the fast expanding wild type colony mg1655 .",
    "this experiment shows thus that flagellar motility is essential for the surface motility of mg1655 and that we are dealing with an active process of flagellar - dependent swarming motility that is able to _ avoid _ a region .",
    "* the macroscopic characteristics of the experimental patterns are extremely sensitive to humidity which in turn limits the fluid production .",
    "when the fluid production is high the pattern is almost compact with circular envelope and has few wide branches with cells deposits and channels structures within .",
    "whereas when the fluid production is limited the colony expands irregularly , with long , relatively thick branches with high cell densities ( see fig .",
    "[ ecoliflor](d ) ) , very few secondary branches and greater gaps ( see fig .  [ results](b)(d ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "* there is a transparent surrounding envelope of slime produced by the colony , see the lower arrow in fig .",
    "[ otros_ecoliflor](a ) , and channel - like structures within the colony surface , see the upper arrow in fig .",
    "[ otros_ecoliflor](a ) . * along the edge in contact with the slime , one can observe a thin layer of quiescent cells apparently packed in an ordered way .",
    "see the lighter line of packed swarmer cells in fig .",
    "[ otros_ecoliflor](b ) , pushed by the turbulent collective motion of groups of swarmer cells in the interior region . *   in this swarming pattern we found , both in the center and the periphery of the pattern , mononucleated active cells , see fig .",
    "[ cells](a ) , from @xmath9 to @xmath10 m and also with 4 to 6 flagella , see fig .",
    "[ cells](b ) .",
    "the swimmer cells of _ e. coli _ mg1655 found in other patterns with interstitial submerging are roughly @xmath11 m long with 4 to 6 flagella ( data not shown ) . therefore , under these experimental conditions the swarmer cells of _ e. coli _ mg1655 do not seem to undergo a significant change in their cellular characteristics for surface translocation .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     although the simple pattern analogy is not sufficient to conclude that the model is correct , predicting the behavior when several control parameters are changed is a good tool to validate it . under the circumstances reported here",
    "the parameter that had the strongest impact on the emerging pattern was indeed the humidity .",
    "but under different experimental conditions other factors , such as local cell densities and quorum sensing or type and quantity of nutrient supply required for the flagellar synthesis and activation , may be considered as essential .",
    "branching is due to the sensitivity of the system to local irregularities whose small perturbing effect is enlarged due to the non - linearity of the diffusion term describing the cooperative spreading of the colony .",
    "branching patterns have also been seen in other bacteria such as _ b. subtilis _ , @xcite , and in _",
    "p. dendritiformis _ var .",
    "_ dendron _ ( genera paenibacillus of _ b. subtilis _ ) , @xcite . in these colonies , when the motility of the colony is strongly limited , the advancing front is extremely sensitive to local irregularities and shows very frequent tip splitting leading to very ramified , thin branches . in some cases ( like the so - called dense branching morphology )",
    "the distribution of branch lengths is even exponential , suggesting that the tip - splitting of branches takes place at random @xcite .",
    "in our study case when the motility is reduced , the density of motile lubricating cells in the advancing front is incremented , the fluid level increases also and the advancing branches are thick , with low branching rate .",
    "this mechanism of response of the colony to adverse conditions has been implemented mathematically as follows : a thresholding condition on the fluid level launches the production of lubricating swarming cells v and the reproduction rate is increased in fluid rich regions . since the collective colonial motility expressed by the diffusion term shows a strong dependence on the density of motile cells @xmath12 , the very dense branches are less sensitive to local irregularities and show thus a lower branching rate .",
    "studies such as this one are aimed at understanding the principles underlying self - organized pattern formation processes and establishing a systematic correspondence between the observed macroscopic colonial patterns and the putative microscopic collective physics .",
    "the new biological pattern has indeed given us some hints about the underlying collective physical principles or colonial strategy .",
    "this strategy , or part of it , may be common to other bacterial patterns .",
    "for instance branching patterns have been reported recently on a colony of _ b. subtilis _ where potassium ions were shown to increase the production of lubricating fluid with surfactin and thus increment the motility substantially without formation of flagella ( not swarming)@xcite .",
    "when the motility is reduced due to a low fluid production the colony shows also thick branches with relatively low branching rate .",
    "a fluid preceding each dendritic finger of growth can be seen . from analysis of this information alone",
    ", we conjecture that a similar mechanism may take place in this case : under adverse conditions the production of lubricating cells would be increased , reproduction may also be more effective in fluid rich regions and in turn these branches would have higher density showing again a low sensitivity to local irregularities and low branching rate .",
    "the population pressure would also induce here a negative gradient term .",
    "swarming in _ e. coli _ has been previously reported on other strains that swarm due to a differentiation from the swimming state to a swarming - adapted strongly hyperflagellated , multinucleated state @xcite .",
    "this present work reports on the swarming ability of another _ e. coli _ strain , the wild type mg1655 , that shows a greater variety of patterns . instead of cell hyperflagellation , the strategy chosen for colonization is a strong fluid production and incremented density of motile cells , the result is a fast advancing colony with low branching rate . since _",
    "e. coli _ is a genetically well characterized organism , the experiments reported here can be used for further studies of the genetic expression associated to the collective , self - organized , swarming pattern formation process .",
