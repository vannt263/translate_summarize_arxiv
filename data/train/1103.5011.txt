    "mixing of scalar fields is a problem that is crucial to several environmental issues as well as engineering applications . in many situations",
    "the underlying flow is spatially smooth and divergence - free while molecular diffusion is usually much weaker than the stirring strength of the flow ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "notwithstanding the apparent simplicity of the flow , its effect on the scalar field can be rather complex : a simple time - dependence is often sufficient for the flow to be chaotically mixing in which case the gradients of the scalar fields are greatly amplified ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite recognized that this amplification is responsible for the rapid dissipation of any initial scalar inhomogeneity and thus the efficiency at which a scalar is mixed .    in the continual presence of sources and sinks ,",
    "a statistical equilibrium is attained in which the rate of injection of scalar variance balances the rate of its dissipation . in this case , the most basic way to measure the flow s mixing efficiency is to consider the equilibrium variance of the scalar : the lower its value , the better mixed is the scalar field . @xcite",
    "derived a rigorous lower bound for the scalar variance that was further enhanced by @xcite using the scalar dissipation rate as a constraint . @xcite and @xcite derived bounds for the small- and large - scale scalar variance ( ) . this set of bounds",
    "have successfully captured some of the key parameters in the flow and source - sink distribution that control the scalar variances .",
    "their general applicability means that they can be used to test theoretical predictions of scalar mixing for various flow and source - sink configurations .",
    "this is especially useful for high - pclet flows ( @xmath1 ) for which analytical solutions are difficult to obtain while high - resolution numerical simulations can become prohibitively expensive .",
    "however , the bounds on the variance of the scalar and its gradient do not depend on the gradients of the velocity field and in many cases , can be realized by uniform flows .",
    "they therefore do not capture the effect of stirring .",
    "these bounds are then relevant when the mixing of a scalar is mainly controlled by the process of transport from the sources to the sinks .    motivated by the apparent lack of control of the stirring process",
    ", we here focus on the characteristic lengthscale , @xmath6 , at which the scalar variance is dissipated , or equivalently its inverse , the dissipation wavenumber , @xmath7 . its value , should , within a suitable range of parameters , be directly related to the batchelor lengthscale , @xmath8 .",
    "the latter lengthscale , obtained in @xcite , describes the effect of stirring on the spatial structure of the scalar field .",
    "we here examine the behaviour of @xmath0 for different values of the control parameters , @xmath2 and @xmath9 , where @xmath9 denotes the ratio of the characteristic lengthscale of the velocity , @xmath4 , and that of the source field , @xmath5 . after formulating the problem in section [ sec : formulation ] ,",
    "we next seek a set of upper bounds for @xmath0 ( section [ sec : bounds ] ) . in section [ sec : regimes ] , we investigate the behaviour of these bounds as @xmath9 varies .",
    "we find that , in the high - pclet limit , the behaviour of @xmath0 is characterized by four distinct regimes , one of which corresponds to the batchelor regime .",
    "the use of homogenization theory implies a fifth regime for @xmath0 . in section [ sec : numerics ] ,",
    "we examine the relevance of the bounds by performing a set of numerical simulations for a renewing type of flow .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the temporal and spatial evolution of the concentration , @xmath10 , of a passive scalar , continually replenished by a source - sink distribution , is given by the forced advection - diffusion equation .",
    "its general form , expressed in terms of dimensional variables , is given by [ ad - nd ] _",
    "t(,t)+(/_u , t)(,t)= ( , t)+ s(/_s ) , where @xmath11 is the molecular diffusivity , @xmath12 is an incompressible velocity field ( i.e. @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 is a steady source field .",
    "they are prescribed within a domain , @xmath15 , that we take to be a @xmath16-dimensional box of size @xmath17 on which we apply either periodic or no - flux boundary conditions .",
    "this way , the boundaries can not generate any additional variability in the scalar field .",
    "the amplitude of the velocity and source field is respectively measured by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents a space - time average such that [ eqn : spacetime ] f _ t_0^tdt_d",
    "f(,t ) , and @xmath21 denotes the volume of the domain . without loss of generality , we can assume that the spatial averages of @xmath22 and @xmath23 are both zero ( where negative values of @xmath24 correspond to sinks for @xmath25 ) so that @xmath10 eventually attains a statistical equilibrium with @xmath26 .",
    "the first parameter is the pclet number , @xmath2 , defined as    u _",
    "u/ , which describes the strength of stirring relative to molecular diffusion .",
    "the second parameter is the ratio , @xmath9 , of the velocity lengthscale , @xmath4 , to the source lengthscale , @xmath5 , defined as _",
    "there are many ways to quantify mixing .",
    "the simplest perhaps measure is given by the long - time spatial average of the scalar variance , which for @xmath26 , reads ^2 ^ 2 .",
    "a scalar field is well - mixed when its distribution is nearly homogeneous i.e. has a value of @xmath27 that is small .",
    "conversely , a badly - mixed scalar distribution is one that is inhomogeneous i.e. has a large value of @xmath27 .",
    "the large - scale scalar variance introduced by the source at @xmath5 is transferred into small - scales where it is dissipated by molecular diffusion .",
    "this transfer is greatly enhanced by the amplification of the scalar gradients induced by a stirring flow",
    ". the average rate at which the scalar variance is dissipated is given by @xmath28 where : [ chi_def ] ||^2 .",
    "we can now define the _ dissipation lengthscale _",
    ", @xmath6 , as the average lengthscale at which the scalar variance is dissipated .",
    "let the _ dissipation wavenumber _ , @xmath0 , denote the inverse of @xmath6 .",
    "then , @xmath6 and @xmath0 are given by [ kd ] k_d^2 _ d^-2 = . by construction ,",
    "the dissipation scales ( [ kd ] ) characterize the spatial variation of the scalar field and as such , provide an alternative way to quantify mixing .",
    "the dissipation wavenumber is related ( although it is not always equal ) to the diffusive cut - off scale of the @xmath25-spectrum . for a freely decaying scalar ( i.e. @xmath29 ) ,",
    "@xcite estimated this cut - off lengthscale to be independent of the initial configuration of the scalar field with [ batchelor ] _ _ b = , where @xmath8 stands for batchelor s lengthscale .",
    "being independent of the source properties , @xmath8 can be used as a reference to which the value of @xmath0 can be compared for varying values of @xmath9 and @xmath2 .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ ad - nd ] ) by @xmath25 and taking the space - time average ( [ eqn : spacetime ] ) gives the following integral constraint for @xmath30 : [ constraint1 ] = s .",
    "thus , the average rate at which scalar variance is injected by the source at @xmath5 is equal to the average rate at which scalar variance is dissipated by molecular diffusion at small scales . using the integral constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) , it is then straightforward to show that @xmath31 and @xmath27 are intimately related .",
    "in particular , @xmath32 @xmath33 expresses the correlation between the scalar and source fields and takes the values between @xmath34 . for fixed values of @xmath35 and @xmath11 ,",
    "there exist two ways to reduce the variance of the scalar : the first one relies on minimizing the correlation @xmath33 while the second one relies on maximizing the value of @xmath0 . minimizing the correlation @xmath33",
    "can be achieved by choosing a flow that rapidly transports fluid parcels from a source region ( @xmath36 ) to a sink ( @xmath37 ) . in this configuration ,",
    "the flow is not necessarily a stirring flow ; a uniform flow can be just as efficient in reducing @xmath33 ( see @xcite where the importance of efficient scalar transport from the sources to the sinks is highlighted for optimal mixing ) . the flow process that suppresses the scalar variance is in this case the process of _ transport_. the second way to reduce the scalar variance is to increase the value of @xmath0 .",
    "this increase can be achieved by choosing a flow that rapidly stretches fluid parcels so that the magnitude of the scalar gradients are greatly amplified .",
    "the flow process that suppresses the scalar variance is in this case the process of _",
    "stirring_. thus , information about either @xmath33 or @xmath0 can provide us with some insight on the mechanisms involved in the reduction of @xmath27 .    in the next session we focus on bounding the value of @xmath0 .",
    "proper manipulation of the forced advection - diffusion equation ( [ ad - nd ] ) leads to a number of constraints that can be employed to deduce a set of upper and lower bounds for the mixing measures under consideration .",
    "a first integral constraint is given by equation ( [ constraint1 ] ) .",
    "following @xcite , a second integral constraint can be obtained by multiplying equation ( [ ad - nd ] ) by an arbitrary , spatially smooth ` test field ' , @xmath38 , that satisfies the same boundary conditions as @xmath39 .",
    "space - time averaging and integrating by parts leads to [ constraint2 ] + = - s. choosing @xmath40 we first apply the cauchy - schwartz inequality on equation ( [ constraint2 ] ) to isolate @xmath27 .",
    "we then use hlder s inequality which leads to the following lower bound for the variance @xmath27 :    [ bnd_sigma ] @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are non - dimensional numbers that only depend on the ` shape ' of the source field and not on its amplitude or characteristic lengthscale .",
    "explicitly they are given by [ c1 ] c_1= c_2= , where the hat symbol signifies differentiation with respect to @xmath44 .",
    "using expressions ( [ measures ] ) and ( [ bnd_sigma](b ) ) , we obtain the following upper bound for @xmath31 : @xmath45 both bounds ( [ bnd_sigma ] ) and ( [ bnd_a ] ) were first derived in @xcite .",
    "a new upper bound for @xmath31 can be obtained by considering the spatial and temporal evolution of the gradient of @xmath25 , [ grad ] _",
    "t+ ( ) = -()^+ s , the average rate at which the variance of the scalar gradient is dissipated is @xmath46 where @xmath47 is defined by ||^2 .",
    "multiplying equation ( [ grad ] ) by @xmath48 and taking the space - time average ( [ eqn : spacetime ] ) gives the following integral constraint for @xmath47 : [ constraint3 ] = - ( ) ^ + s , where the tensor @xmath49 $ ] is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient tensor[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "using hlder s inequality , the first term in ( [ constraint3 ] ) is bounded by :    [ step1 ] |()^ | _ , t , | ( ) ^ | ||^2 , where @xmath50 is a unit vector so that @xmath51 . integrating by parts the second term in ( [ constraint3 ] ) and using the cauchy - schwartz inequality results in : [ step2 ] |s | |s|^2 ^ [ step ]    combining the two bounds in ( [ step ] ) leads to the following upper bound for the dissipation rate of the variance of the scalar gradient : [ bnd_eta ] c_3 + c_2 , where @xmath43 and @xmath52 are non - dimensional numbers that depend on the shapes of the source and velocity field , respectively .",
    "@xmath43 was previously defined in equation ( [ c1 ] ) and @xmath52 is defined by [ c3 ] c_3= _ , t , | ( u)^ | , where the tilde symbol signifies derivation with respect to @xmath53 . the upper bound for @xmath47 in equation ( [ bnd_eta ] ) can serve to bound @xmath0 by observing the following inequality that relates @xmath30 , @xmath27 and @xmath47 : [ useful_ineq ] = || , obtained by partial integration and application of the cauchy - schwartz inequality on the definition of @xmath30 in equation ( [ chi_def ] ) . using the definition ( [ kd ] ) of @xmath0 and the square of ( [ useful_ineq ] ) we then have    [ bnd_kd_2 ] @xmath54 where the bounds ( [ bnd_eta ] ) on @xmath47 and ( [ bnd_sigma ] ) on @xmath27 were employed in order to deduce the last inequality .",
    "the above quadratic inequality in @xmath31 yields the following upper bound for @xmath31 : [ bnd_b ] k_d^2__b^2 c_3 + , where as before , @xmath31 is normalized by the batchelor lengthscale ( [ batchelor ] )",
    ".    bound ( [ bnd_eta ] ) can further be improved for the particular case of a monochromatic source i.e. , a source that satisfies the helmholtz equation : [ harmonic ] s = -c_2 k_s^2 s. it follows that @xmath55 , where the latter is directly obtained using the integral constraint ( [ constraint1 ] ) .",
    "substituting in equation ( [ constraint3 ] ) , bound ( [ bnd_eta ] ) becomes [ bnd_eta2 ] ( c_3 + c_2 ) . from constraint",
    "( [ constraint1 ] ) , @xmath56 and thus equation ( [ bnd_eta2 ] ) provides a better bound for @xmath47 than equation ( [ bnd_eta ] ) . using this inequality , equation ( [ useful_ineq ] )",
    "leads to [ bnd_b2 ] k_d^2__b^2c_3 + c_2 ^ 2 ^ -1 .",
    "figure [ fig_1 ] shows the behaviour of the two bounds , given by eqs .",
    "( [ bnd_a ] ) and ( [ bnd_b ] ) , for various pclet numbers , as a function of @xmath9 . for small pclet number ( @xmath57 ) ,",
    "bound ( [ bnd_b ] ) does not improve bound ( [ bnd_a ] ) since for all values of @xmath9 it is either greater or similar to bound ( [ bnd_a ] ) . however , as the pclet number increases beyond @xmath58 values , the process of stirring becomes increasingly important and expression ( [ bnd_b ] ) can significantly improve the upper bound for @xmath59 .",
    "this improvement depends on the value of @xmath9 .",
    "it is only for values of @xmath60 that bound ( [ bnd_b ] ) becomes smaller than bound ( [ bnd_a ] ) and thus a better upper bound for @xmath59 .",
    "thus , in the high - pclet limit ( @xmath61 ) , the two bounds capture different regimes of mixing that we now describe .",
    "we first focus on @xmath60 .",
    "the three terms inside the square root in equation ( [ bnd_b ] ) give rise to three different power - law regimes for the behaviour of the upper bound of @xmath59 .      for @xmath62 , the last term inside the square root in equation ( [ bnd_b ] ) dominates .",

    "it is the second term inside the square root in equation ( [ bnd_b ] ) that dominates . in this case ,",
    "@xmath66 and thus the following applies for @xmath0 : k_d ( c_1c_2 ) ^ , ^ [ bnd_rg2 ] where sub - dominant terms have been dropped .",
    "this scaling is likely to be related to the formation of boundary layers within which the scalar variance is large .",
    "their generation is associated with regions in which the continual injection of scalar variance can not be suppressed by sweeping across the sources and sinks . @xcite",
    "examined the case of a steady , uni - directional shear flow and a monochromatic source from where they obtained that for @xmath1 , @xmath67 .",
    "nevertheless , we here find that regime ii is absent in the case of a monochromatic source . whether the scaling suggested by bound ( [ bnd_rg2 ] ) is realized by more complex flows and source functions than the one in @xcite or if bound ( [ bnd_b ] )",
    "can be improved remains an open question .",
    "the third regime appears for @xmath68 . in this case",
    ", the first term inside the square root in equation ( [ bnd_b ] ) dominates and bound ( [ bnd_b ] ) becomes @xmath69 .",
    "thus , in this regime , the bound for @xmath70 implies that @xmath0 and @xmath8 are inversely proportional to each other .",
    "this relation corresponds to the prediction made in @xcite .",
    "it follows that k_d , o(1 ) ^ , [ bnd_rg3 ] where sub - dominant terms have been dropped .",
    "note the dependence of equation ( [ bnd_rg3 ] ) on the stirring timescale , @xmath71 .",
    "it is therefore clear that in this regime , the dissipation wavenumber is governed by the balance between the processes of diffusion and stirring .",
    "note that for a monochromatic source , this regime appears for @xmath72 .",
    "when @xmath73 , the characteristic lengthscale of the source becomes larger than that of the velocity field and bound ( [ bnd_a ] ) becomes relevant . in this case ,",
    "@xmath74 and thus k_d , o(1 ) .",
    "[ bnd_rg4 ] thus , in this regime , both the processes of transport between the sources and sinks and diffusion control the behaviour of the dissipation wavenumber .      although not captured by the two bounds , a fifth regime is expected to appear when the characteristic lengthscale of the flow is much smaller than that of the source ( @xmath75 ) . in this case , the large - scale solution to equation ( [ ad - nd ] ) is well - approximated by @xmath76 that satisfies the following equation : [ eqn : thetabar ] _",
    "t | = | + s , where an effective diffusion operator has replaced the advective term in equation ( [ ad - nd ] ) .",

    "it thus follows that for this range of values of @xmath9 , the dissipation wavenumber can be approximated by k_d^2= , 1 .",
    "this approximation is obtained using @xmath80 , @xmath81 and multiplying equation ( [ eqn : thetabar ] ) by @xmath82 and space - time averaging to estimate @xmath83 .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath79 can be rigorously obtained within the framework of _ homogenization theory _ in which multi - scale asymptotic methods are employed in order to derive the large - scale effect of the small - scale velocity field ( for derivation see review by @xcite and also @xcite in which the case of a continuously replenished scalar is examined ) . in general , the coefficients of @xmath79 depend on the value of @xmath2 with @xmath84 , where the exponent @xmath85 depends on the type of flow under consideration .",
    "for shear flows ( taylor transport ) , @xmath86 ; for globally mixing chaotic advection flows , @xmath87 ; for cellular flows with closed field lines , @xmath88 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "the above scaling increases faster in @xmath9 than the bound for @xmath70 in regime iv .",
    "it follows that the validity of the asymptotic result ( [ homo ] ) is constrained by the upper bound ( [ bnd_a ] ) . for sufficiently high pclet values",
    ", this is the case when @xmath89 .",
    "based on this argument , the scalings ( [ homo1 ] ) and ( [ homo ] ) are expected to be valid at most when [ rangehomo ] \\{1,^1-}. in general , the range of validity of the homogenization theory is limited to @xmath90 ( see @xcite ) . the relevance of @xmath91 was shown to be true for the mixing measures of @xcite , calculated for a particular class of steady flows ( with @xmath86 ) in @xcite and for a family of steady flows of various values for @xmath85 in @xcite . for chaotic flows",
    "however ( @xmath87 ) the predictions of homogenization theory have been shown in @xcite to be surprisingly accurate even for @xmath92 .",

    "the scalar variance is , in the bulk of the domain , controlled by the process of sweeping between the sources and the sinks and thus its value is small .",
    "the only exception is a small number of isolated thin , boundary layers within which the scalar field is highly varying .",
    "these thin layers are formed in regions where the background flow is nearly stagnant so that the continual injection of scalar variance can not be suppressed by the process of sweeping . for our particular flow ( [ eqn : v ] ) the regions of zero velocity are lines that , depending on time , are either vertical or horizontal .",

    "these layers are similar to those obtained in @xcite for a steady , sine flow .",
    "the ( horizontal / vertical ) thin layers that are formed in the first half of the period are then stretched in the second half at the same time as new ( vertical / horizontal ) thin layers are formed .",
    "the formation of these highly - varying , thin layers yields two power - law scalings for the variance spectrum : for small wavenumbers ( @xmath122 ) , the spectrum has a positive , power - law behaviour , given by @xmath123 .",
    "this behaviour can be deduced by noting that , for scales much larger than the source lengthscale , these structures are `` @xmath124-like '' .",
    "conversely , for large wavenumbers - albeit smaller than the batchelor wavenumber ( @xmath125 ) , the batchelor spectrum is recovered .",
    "in this work we obtained a set of upper bounds for the dissipation wavenumber , @xmath0 , of a continuously forced scalar field that is stirred by a spatially smooth velocity field .",
    "we focused on the dissipation wavenumber because it provides a measure for the enhancement of mixing due to the process of stirring . unlike the freely decaying case in which stirring is the only mechanism for efficient mixing , in the forced case , transport can be as effective as stirring .",
    "this is clear from equation ( [ measures ] ) in which it is easy to see that the scalar variance can be reduced either by increasing the dissipation wavenumber or by decreasing the correlation between the scalar and source fields .",
    "previous investigations have considered a number of mixing measures for which a set of bounds were derived ( see @xcite ) . however , these bounds do not always distinguish between the processes of stirring and transport .",
    "in particular , the bounds on the average variance of the scalar @xmath126 and its gradient @xmath127 do not explicitly depend on the velocity gradients .",
    "thus , the effect of stirring is not captured . as a result , the bound for @xmath0 does not follow the scaling predicted in @xcite .    with the aid of an additional constraint , we here derived a new upper bound for @xmath0 which , within a range of values of @xmath2 and @xmath9 , is , up to a constant , equal to the inverse of the batchelor lengthscale , @xmath128 . the process of stirring is thus reflected in this bound . for large pclet values , both the previous and the new bound become important , with the new bound significantly improving the previous bound for @xmath129 .",
    "the scalings associated with these bounds suggest four different regimes for @xmath0 .",
    "the use of homogenization theory implies a fifth regime .",
    "the most interesting , perhaps , behaviour occurs for @xmath130 . for these range of values of @xmath9 , the scaling suggested by the upper bounds for @xmath0 transitions from a behaviour controlled by transport to a behaviour controlled by stirring .",
    "we tested the relevance of our theoretical predictions for the particular example of the `` alternating sine flow '' and a monochromatic source .",
    "we considered a large range of values for @xmath9 , covering more than three orders of magnitude : from @xmath75 ( in which case homogenization theory becomes relevant ) to @xmath131 ( in which case diffusion starts to dominate ) .",
    "the theoretical results were shown in figure [ fig_2 ] to give a qualitatively good description of the non - trivial dependence of @xmath0 on @xmath9 .",
    "we now discuss the relation of our results with a particular set of mixing measures , the so - called _ mixing efficiencies _ , @xmath132 .",
    "these were defined in @xcite and @xcite in terms of @xmath133 , for @xmath134 , and the same variances obtained for @xmath135 satisfying ( [ ad - nd ] ) in the absence of a flow ( @xmath136 ) : [ mixeffs ] e_p .",
    "@xmath132 are commonly larger than unity . in the high - pclet limit and for spatially",
    "smooth source fields , they were shown to satisfy @xmath137 , for @xmath138 . using @xmath139 and equation ( [ measures ] ) into the definition for @xmath140",
    ", we obtain that [ eqn : meas1 ] e_0 = c_4 , where @xmath141 is a non - dimensional number defined as @xmath142 ( the hat symbol denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath44 ) .",
    "similarly , using equation ( [ kd ] ) , [ eqn : meas2 ] e_1 = c_5 , where @xmath143 is a non - dimensional number defined as @xmath144 .",
    "thus , neither @xmath140 nor @xmath145 include separate information about @xmath0 or @xmath146 .",
    "since we have no control over the value of @xmath33 , we can not directly compare the bounds for @xmath0 with those for @xmath140 or @xmath145 .",
    "instead , the two sets of bounds provide complementary information . we note that from equations ( [ eqn : meas1 ] ) and",
    "( [ eqn : meas2 ] ) , we expect that if the suppression of variance is solely due to the suppression of @xmath33 ( the case of a uniform flow ) , the two efficiencies @xmath140 and @xmath145 should scale similarly with @xmath2 . if however the suppression of the variance is due to an increase in @xmath0 , @xmath140 and @xmath145 are expected to scale differently .",
    "the case of rough velocity fields is also very important because of its relevance to turbulent flows .",
    "although in this case bound ( [ bnd_b ] ) can not be defined , it is still worth examining the implications of our results using simple scaling arguments at the cost of losing some of the mathematical rigor . in three - dimensional turbulent flows , the most energetic scales , @xmath147 ,",
    "are large and control the transport between the sources and the sinks .",
    "conversely , the smallest eddies have the largest shearing rate and control the stirring . a transition in the behaviour of @xmath0 is thus expected when bound ( [ bnd_a ] ) ( that is still valid for rough velocity fields )",
    "intersects the batchelor scaling , @xmath148 . in terms of the reynolds number , @xmath149 ( where @xmath150 is the kinematic viscosity )",
    ", the batchelor scale reads , [ batch2 ] _ _",
    "b^2 ~ ^- , where we assume that @xmath151 . comparing ( [ batch2 ] ) with",
    "bound ( [ bnd_a ] ) , we obtain that a transition occurs when @xmath152 . for @xmath153 ,",
    "the scaling @xmath154 holds while for @xmath155 , bound ( [ bnd_a ] ) becomes smaller than @xmath128 and the scaling induced from ( [ bnd_rg4 ] ) is expected .",
