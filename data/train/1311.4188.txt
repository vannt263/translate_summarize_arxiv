    "the discovery of surface enhanced raman scattering has reinforced the interest in the study of the optical properties of rough metallic surfaces , in particular the understanding of near - field features .",
    "we consider the reflection of an electromagnetic wave on the grating described on figure [ fig.geom ] .",
    "this grating is supposed to be infinite in the @xmath0-direction and periodic in the @xmath1-direction , with period @xmath2 .",
    "the grating consists of grooves of width @xmath3 and depth @xmath4 .",
    "the width @xmath3 ( and in practice the period @xmath2 , see @xcite and physical parameters , section [ sec.param ] ) is supposed to be smaller than the wavelength .",
    "the dimensions of this grating give rise to two effects when exposed to tm - polarized light .",
    "first , since its period is of the order of the optical wavelength , experiments show extinctions of the specular reflectivity at specific incident angles .",
    "these extinctions stem from the transfer of energy to surface plasmons , which are very intense and propagate along the surface . besides the studied gratings have also a depth of the order of the wavelength and this yields resonances inside the cavity .",
    "given a monochromatic incident wave with a wave vector of modulus @xmath5 , we want to compute the reflected modes in the domain ( i ) and the cavity modes in the cavities ( ii ) , such that the resulting magnetic field @xmath6 is solution to the helmholtz equation @xmath7    we apply here the modal development method @xcite , which consists in writing the field in ( i ) and ( ii ) as a sum of modes and using continuity properties to link both expansions .",
    "this method has the advantage to lead to very simple and efficient computations .",
    "other more elaborate methods have also been successfully applied to diffraction gratings , such as integral methods , coupling of finite elements and rayleigh expansion ,   ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this computation requires a choice for the treatment of the surface which is covered with gold .",
    "modal computations can be easily made treating all the gold surfaces with a perfectly conducting boundary condition ( perfect metal ) . in @xcite , walls ( vertical surfaces ) are treated with such a condition and horizontal surfaces with a surface impedance condition ( real metal ) .",
    "our aim here is to compare these computations with full real - metal ones and to analyze the impact of the surface condition choice on the computed mode coefficients .    in section [ sec.setting ]",
    "we describe the modal development and the different boundary conditions addressed .",
    "we give the general outline of the modal method and the physical parameters used for the simulations which reproduce experiments . in section [ sec.modes ] , we explain how to find the cavity modes , perform an asymptotic expansion of the @xmath8th modal wave number in terms of @xmath8 and of the surface impedance , and study cavity mode energies .",
    "we also show that these modes span the functional space of interest , which justifies _ a posteriori _ the use of the modal method , even for real - metal surface conditions . in section [ sec.num ] ,",
    "we give hints on how to tune numerical parameters to obtain qualitatively good results compared to specular reflectance experimental measures . on the way",

    "indeed we do not want to model the electromagnetic wave which penetrates in the metal within the skin depth , but replace it by the condition @xmath24 where @xmath8 is the exterior normal of the metallic surface and @xmath25 ( for the usual determination of the square root ) is the relative surface impedance , computed from the relative dielectric constants @xmath26 and @xmath27 of the dielectric medium and the metal respectively . here",

    "they appear even sooner as figure [ fig.energy_pos ] would induce , which means that we should take into account the first evanescent modes even in the range where the monomode assumption is supposed to be valid .",
    "we see that the second cavity mode can be predominant over the fundamental mode for some wavenumber .",
    "this means that we can `` switch on '' almost pure second cavity modes for precise experimental settings .",
    "we have investigated the role of the choice of boundary conditions on the description of reflected and cavity modes in sub - wavelength gratings . as one could expect",
    "we have shown that a better agreement with experiments can be achieved by considering real - metal conditions on all boundaries .",
    "using asymptotic expansions , we have found a mean to produce numerical simulations in this full metal case which are not much more intricate that the mixed case previously used in the literature . on the way we have studied the role of the numerical parameters used to solve the theoretical infinite dimensional systems , the need to keep a certain number of evanescent modes , and a way to perform computations without being perturbed by conditioning issues .",
