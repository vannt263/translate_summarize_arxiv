    "the idea that stars in globular clusters ( gcs ) are a coeval population has been a long disputed topic with significant discussion devoted to the presence ( or lack thereof ) of multiple main sequences and subgiant branches ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) .",
    "however , recent observational evidence has demonstrated that these multiple stellar populations ( msps ) are not only ubiquitous but also make up a sizable fraction ( @xmath140 - 60% ) of the total stellar mass @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic observations of msps in gcs have also unveiled differences in their light element abundances ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these anomalies can only be produced if these msps were formed from material processed at temperatures @xmath2k @xcite .",
    "to explain the presence of msps with the observed abundance anomalies the following timeline has been identified @xcite : after the first generation of stars is formed and intracluster gas is expelled by supernovae , matter processed in the interiors of agb stars is returned to the ism through winds and after several 100 myrs a second generation of stars is formed from a mixture of stellar - processed material and captured ism gas .",
    "some of the issues at the forefront of attention include the type and age of stars able to process gas at the required internal temperatures while at the same time efficiently returning material into gcs to form a sizable mass fraction of new stars .",
    "we address both of these issues here .",
    "the effective retention of stellar wind material to create msps of comparable mass presents a challenge to the current understanding of gc formation @xcite .",
    "accounting for the inflow and mixing of pristine ism material slightly lowers the retained mass requirements , however the original gcs still need to be significantly more massive than those currently observed @xcite . despite their relevance ,",
    "stellar wind gas retention has so far only been studied for a very restricted number of systems @xcite . here",
    "we expand upon these studies with hydrodynamical simulations which explore the possible combinations of cluster mass , compactness and stellar age to determine the optimum parameter space for maximal gas retention .",
    "to examine the ability of clusters to effectively retain the winds emanating from their evolving stellar members , we simulate mass and energy injection in isolated core potentials under the assumption of spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "the one - dimensional hydrodynamical equations are solved using flash , a parallel , adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamical code @xcite .",
    "the winds from the closely packed stellar members are assumed to shock and thermalize such that density and energy contributions can be treated as source terms in the hydrodynamical equations . in spherical symmetry ,",
    "these equations can be written as @xcite :    @xmath3    @xmath4    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the gas density , pressure , radial velocity and internal energy density , respectively . here , @xmath10 is the cooling rate for gas with ion and electron number densities @xmath11 and @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the cooling function for gas at temperature @xmath14 and metallicity @xmath15 .",
    "we use @xmath13 from @xcite for @xmath16 and @xcite for @xmath17 .    the @xmath18 and @xmath19 terms in equations ( [ eq : masscons])-([eq : energy ] )",
    "are used here to mediate the total rate of mass and energy injection . for @xmath20 stars each with average mass loss rate @xmath21 and wind energy injection rate @xmath22 we have @xmath23 and @xmath24 , such that @xmath25 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the effects of mass segregation and assume @xmath26 .",
    "we also neglect the effects of external mass accumulation , which can be an important source of gas when clusters reside in cool , dense ism gas @xcite .",
    "while specific heating sources such as photoionization or supernova are not explicitly included , the overall effects of additional energy injection in the cluster are discussed in ",

    "the stellar cluster gravitational potentials are modeled as plummer models @xcite @xmath27^{1/2}}\\ ] ] for a given total mass , @xmath28 , and velocity dispersion , @xmath29 .",
    "in addition to following the dynamics of the gas under the influence of @xmath30 , the self gravity of the gas is computed using flash s multipole gravity module .    in cases where catastrophic cooling occurs , a sub - grid model for star formation",
    "is implemented to prevent premature collapse .",
    "our cooling prescription is modified following @xcite by turning off energy losses and allowing the gas to evolve adiabatically when the jean s length of the collapsing gas structure is comparable ( or smaller than ) to the cell size of our simulation .",
    "such a method approximates the transition of an isothermally collapsing cloud to an optically thick , adiabatically evolving protostellar cluster while forgoing the computationally expensive three dimensional radiative transfer calculations required to treat this problem accurately . because we do not include an explicit star formation prescription , we allow such unstable regions to evolve for a few sound crossing times before halting the simulation .      to estimate the net mass loss and mean thermal velocities of the colliding winds , we first follow the formalism developed by @xcite where the integrated wind kinetic energy and mass loss of the stellar population s turn off star",
    "is used as a proxy for the average wind velocity and mass loss rate : @xmath31 @xmath32 here @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the kinetic energy and mass loss input rates integrated over the lifetime of the turn - off stars , @xmath35 .",
    "the effects of the additional input of mass and kinetic energy by stars with @xmath36 , which are neglected in the formalism we just outlined , can be included by convolving the above definitions of the average mass loss rate and wind velocity with an initial mass function ( imf ) and a star formation history .",
    "following @xcite , the average number of stars in a mass interval @xmath37 $ ] evolving between @xmath38 $ ] is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the imf , which we assume is accurately described by the @xcite imf , and @xmath41 is the normalized star formation history . for a non - evolving imf , @xmath42 , with a mass distribution extending from @xmath43 to @xmath44 , the normalized star formation history can be written as @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the lifetime of a star of a given @xmath47 .",
    "examples of @xmath41 include a constant star formation rate , @xmath48 , or a coeval population , @xmath49 , with all stars formed at @xmath50 .",
    "the average mass @xmath51 and kinetic energy @xmath52 injected into the cluster environment at a time @xmath53 , by a population of stars with @xmath54 $ ] and whose birth rate is regulated by @xmath41 , are then given by @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively .",
    "stars that have lifetimes @xmath57 forsake the stellar population unless they were born during the most recent star formation time interval @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "for this reason , @xmath50 is set to @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "this formalism allows for equations ( [ eq : vto ] ) and ( [ eq : mdotto ] ) to be cast into a more general form @xmath60 and @xmath61 in what follows , we assume the stellar population initially residing in star clusters is coeval such that @xmath62 , which provides an accurate description for clusters with @xmath63  myrs .    to compute the individual mass loss rates @xmath64 and wind velocities @xmath65 we use the mesa stellar evolution models @xcite .",
    "we use this code to follow the evolution of a grid of stellar models with @xmath66 - @xmath67 from zams to either the white dwarf stage , end of the agb phase , or compact object creation .",
    "the mass loss rates during the crucial agb phase are estimated here using the wind prescription of @xcite with a normalization of @xmath68 consistent with lmc measurements @xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath69 for most models although the effects of changing the metallicity are discussed in ",
    "[ section : discussion ] .",
    "the mass injection properties , characterized here by the mass loss rates and wind velocities emanating from a coeval population of stars , change dramatically as the population evolves .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the evolution of the average stellar wind parameters . as the wind velocities and stellar mass loss rates change , so does the ability of a cluster potential to retain the shocked stellar wind gas . note that the differences between the turn off mass and population averaged prescriptions manifests itself predominately in the values of the wind velocity .    a young star cluster , corresponding to time _ a _ in figure [ fig : fig1 ] , with its high average wind velocity",
    "can not retain gas effectively if @xmath70 .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure [ fig : fig2 ] which shows the properties of the shocked stellar wind gas confined to a cluster potential characterized by @xmath71 and @xmath72 for both turn off mass and population averaged prescriptions ( _ red _ curves ) .",
    "the flow in this case was evolved for @xmath73 .",
    "a young cluster is thus only likely to retain a small quantity of high temperature gas in its inner region , while further away gas is blown out of the system in a wind .",
    "as the cluster members evolve , a dramatic decrease in the average wind velocity occurs due to the dominant contribution of the slow , dense agb winds to the overall mass injection , corresponding to time _",
    "b _ in figure [ fig : fig1 ] . for the star cluster , here assumed to be characterized by a non - evolving gravitational potential , the agb contribution results in stellar wind injection parameters that favor significant mass retention , as shown in figure [ fig : fig1 ] ( _ black _ curves ) . as the stellar wind gas shocks and cools",
    ", mass is efficiently accumulated until the central region becomes jeans unstable , thus triggering star formation . in this case",
    ", the gas flow within the cluster is evolved until @xmath74 , defined here as the sound crossing time within the ( adequately resolved ) jeans unstable region . as the cluster ages ,",
    "remaining stars no longer pass through an extended thermally pulsing agb phase .",
    "this results in a dramatic increase in average wind velocity and decrease in average mass loss rates as seen at time _",
    "c_. as a result , the cluster potential is unable to effectively retain the emanating gas and the wind material flows out of the cluster almost unrestrained .",
    "the ability for a star cluster to retain wind ejecta depends not only on the evolutionary stage of its members but also on their spatial distribution . to illustrate this , in figure [ fig : fig3 ]",
    "we show the properties of the shocked stellar wind gas confined to a shallow potential characterized by @xmath75 and @xmath76 , parameters thought to accurately represent the current stellar mass distribution in m15 @xcite .",
    "a shallow gravitational potential is thus unable to retain a significant amount of stellar wind material , even during the agb phase .",
    "the observational constraint on the allowed gas density in m15 @xcite is consistent with our predictions for the present state of the gas in this system .",
    "the dramatic difference observed in figures [ fig : fig2 ] and [ fig : fig3 ] between the stellar wind mass accumulated in cluster potentials of varying properties motivates our study to compare results obtained with different velocity dispersions and cluster masses . to facilitate comparisons , we first systematically vary the cluster velocity dispersion for a fixed total mass @xmath72 , assuming the turn off mass wind velocity and mass loss rate are representative of the entire population .",
    "the left panel of figure [ fig : fig4 ] gives the amount of accumulated stellar wind mass in units of @xmath28 for a range of cluster velocity dispersions and different evolutionary stages ( @xmath53 ) of the stellar members . by looking at the shaded regions in figure [ fig : fig4 ] ,",
    "the reader can identify the cluster velocity dispersion and mass combinations for which favorable conditions for star formation are satisfied at a given cluster age .",
    "cluster potentials with @xmath77 are not effective at retaining gas in their cores , and gas is blown out of the cluster at all times . as the velocity dispersion increases above @xmath78 , the cluster core is able to retain the shocked and efficiently cooled stellar wind gas , making the central region jeans unstable before ( i.e. @xmath79 ) a significant amount of mass is accumulated into the cluster .",
    "the largest fraction of mass retained takes place for star clusters with @xmath80 . in this case , the potential is steep enough to retain the shocked and subsequently cooled wind material , but shallow enough to force the cold gas to collapse only until a significant amount of mass has been accumulated .",
    "the contours in the left panel of figure [ fig : fig4 ] show that potentials with @xmath81 can endure multiple episodes of star formation albeit involving less retained gas , while potentials with @xmath82 can have only short but more intense star formation periods .",
    "the largest mass accumulation for a single star formation episode occurs for @xmath83 between the ages of @xmath84  gyrs , with a mass retention fraction of @xmath85 .",
    "this value is lower than the @xmath8610% estimated by previous studies @xcite , owing to the fact that we used the time averaged values of the wind velocity which results in about five times larger kinetic energy injection rates than using the instantaneous values .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : fig4 ] , in conjunction with the left panel , allows us to estimate the amount of stellar wind material retained by a star cluster of a given age , mass and velocity dispersion .",
    "the conclusions drawn are based upon the assumption that the cluster potential properties , whose evolution causes are poorly known , remain relatively unaltered for @xmath87 $ ] .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : fig4 ] is self - explanatory - heavier star clusters at a fixed velocity dispersion retain more gas .",
    "the mass retention fraction is observed to increase slightly with augmenting cluster mass as a result of less efficient cooling , which in turn delays the triggering of star formation as mass continues to accumulate .",
    "using the average wind velocity and mass loss rate of the turn off mass star to represent the properties of the entire population underestimates the kinetic energy input arising from the more numerous , lighter stars ( figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "this gives an optimistic value of the wind retention and star formation efficiencies .",
    "the effects of using the total kinetic energy input from the star cluster to calculate effective mass retention are shown in figure [ fig : fig5 ] . direct comparison with figure [ fig : fig4 ]",
    "shows that although the overall mass accumulation is rather similar , in the population - averaged prescription star formation is triggered over a narrower range of velocity dispersions .",
    "not only are higher velocity dispersions required to produce efficient star forming models , but the additional kinetic energy inhibits star formation in the largest mass accumulation regions .",
    "this is because the larger wind velocities keep the gas at higher temperatures , thus quenching star formation .",
    "this mass is subsequently blown out of the cluster at later times when the mass loss rates decrease and the accompanying wind velocities increase .",
    "these results clearly indicate that care must be taken when attempting to estimate the amount of new stars that can be subsequently formed in star clusters as this strongly depends on the assumed mass loss prescriptions , which are uncertain .",
    "while the assumed wind prescription can alter the total amount of gas retained which can create new stars , the contours in figures [ fig : fig4 ] and [ fig : fig5 ] suggest that a stellar cluster with favorable potential parameters , @xmath88 $ ] , can trigger star formation over a large span of time . in reality ,",
    "an episode of star formation will trigger subsequent supernova outbursts which can drive gas away from the central regions of the cluster , deterring further star formation .",
    "we simulate the effects of supernova explosions on gas retention by adding thermal energy to the central region of a typical cluster once star formation has been triggered . to maximize the effects of feedback in our cluster",
    ", we assume a * large * star formation efficiency of 90% , creating @xmath89 in second generation stars for a model from the left panel of figure [ fig : fig4 ] with a @xmath90 retention rate . following the method of @xcite ,",
    "we add in @xmath91 in the central regions of our simulation at a rate of @xmath92 .",
    "this has been scaled from their supernova type ia rate of @xmath93 for a @xmath72 population @xcite . after a period of 100  myrs",
    "the supernova energy injection is halted and the gas is once again allowed accumulate in the central regions of the cluster , starting the cycle over .",
    "figure [ fig : fig6 ] shows this cycle of mass accumulation , star formation and supernova feedback for a simulation at @xmath94 for a model with @xmath72 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . here , it takes approximately 2000  myrs for the cluster to re - trigger star formation once gas has been removed by 100  myrs of type ia supernova feedback .",
    "throughout this work , we have used simplified models to determine how effective a star cluster of a particular age is at retaining gas emanating from its stellar members , under the assumption that its potential remains unaltered during the simulated phase .",
    "we have further assumed a single metallicity for all clusters and have disregarded any heating sources besides supernova feedback and the stellar winds themselves . in this section we relax both of these assumptions .",
    "cluster to cluster variations in light element abundances are commonly observed @xcite .",
    "these variations may cause changes in the mass loss histories of the individual stellar members and the cooling properties of the shocked gas . as the stellar mass loss prescription are mostly independent of metallicity during the evolutionary time periods that are conducive to star formation ( @xmath97 ) @xcite",
    ", we account for the effects of varying metallicity solely in the cooling function .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the effects of changing metallicity for a typical star forming cluster , described here by @xmath72 , @xmath71 , and @xmath98 . as the metallicity is decreased , the cooling becomes less efficient and more material is allowed to flow into the center of the cluster before catastrophic cooling occurs .",
    "this enables relatively more massive star forming episodes to be triggered .",
    "interestingly , when metallicity is decreased beyond @xmath99 , the cooling becomes weak enough to prevent catastrophic cooling at times @xmath100 .",
    "these results suggest that the range of cluster parameters over which large central densities will persist before catastrophic cooling takes place ( figure [ fig : fig4 ] ) will depend on the metallicity of the emanating stellar winds , though , as illustrated in figure [ fig : fig7 ] , the differences are not marked .",
    "in addition to altering the cooling curves , the inclusion of additional cluster heating sources may prevent effective gas retention in our simulations .",
    "we address this problem here by artificially increasing the energy input rate : @xmath101 . under this assumption",
    ", the additional heating sources follow the potential s stellar distribution .",
    "figure [ fig : heating ] shows the effects of the additional heat input in one of our otherwise star forming simulations . for @xmath102",
    ", the gas in the simulation still collapses , triggering star formation . for larger values , on the other hand , the cluster is unable to effectively retain the gas and , as a result , star formation never ensues . by integrating @xmath103 over the cluster s core for @xmath104",
    ", we derive the total energy input rate required to overturn the central mass build up , which for this simulation is about @xmath105 .    in many cases",
    ", the additional energy injection sources might not follow the stellar distribution . as an example , let s compare the heat distribution expected from accreting neutron stars under the assumption that the accretion feedback is proportional to the bondi accretion rate : @xmath106 @xcite . using the volume - averaged density and temperature in the cluster core , @xmath107 and @xmath108k , we derive the average luminosity of a single , accreting neutron star : @xmath109 .",
    "this implies that @xmath110 100 accreting neutron stars are required to reside in the cluster s core in order to significantly offset its cooling properties .",
    "however , to accurately test this phenomena a multi - dimensional approach would be required as feedback would not necessarily act as a simple heating prescription .    in this work ,",
    "we have also tried to minimize the effect of external mass inflow by considering star clusters in isolation .",
    "this is certainly not the case for clusters moving through cold , dense environments , as they can potentially amass a significant amount of gas from their surroundings @xcite .",
    "the stellar winds and exterior inflows in such clusters could combine to create even larger central density enhancements @xcite .",
    "a self consistent treatment of both interior and exterior gas accumulation in multi - dimensional simulations , which includes the effects of compact object accretion , tidal stripping , photoionization , and pulsar heating will be presented elsewhere .",
    "while previous work has estimated the ability of star clusters to retain stellar winds @xcite , calculations have so far been restricted to a small range of cluster properties and stellar ages .",
    "motivated by this , we have calculated gas retention in star clusters of various ages , stellar mass and compactness . in agreement with previous studies",
    "we find that before star formation is triggered about @xmath11110% of the total cluster mass is comprised of retained stellar wind gas , naively implying that the original proto - gcs had to be more massive than what is observed today @xcite .",
    "however , we show that multiple episodes of star formation can in fact take place during the lifetime of a cluster in particular between @xmath112 and @xmath113  gyrs , thus suggesting a sizable enhancement in star formation .",
    "the overlap of this time range with the agb phase further strengthens the case for stellar wind retention as a critical component in the formation of subsequent generations of stars in gcs .",
