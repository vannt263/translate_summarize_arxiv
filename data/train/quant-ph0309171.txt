    "the coherent interaction of atoms with electromagnetic fields has attracted increasing attention recently in studies of nonlinear and quantum optics as well as spectroscopy and precision metrology . under the combined action of several resonant laser fields ,",
    "atoms are optically pumped into a coherent superposition of the ground - state ( hyperfine or magnetic sublevels ) which is decoupled from the original electromagnetic fields .",
    "that is , the atoms are in a so - called `` dark '' state .",
    "such a medium possesses some unique optical properties , for example , coherent population trapping ( cpt )  @xcite , cancellation of absorption due to electromagetically induced transparency ( eit )  @xcite , and steep nonlinear dispersion  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic spectral width of features occurring due to these nonlinear effects is determined by the inverse lifetime of an atom in the coherent superposition of ground states .",
    "since radiative transitions are usually forbidden between these states , the coherence can be preserved for a long time , and in atomic cells its lifetime is usually determined by the interaction time of the atom with the laser beams  @xcite .",
    "the addition of a buffer gas ( inert gases , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , etc . )  to the atomic vapor is a common method for obtaining narrow eit resonances . because of the extremely low spin - exchange cross - section",
    ", the collisions between rubidium and buffer gas atoms or molecules do not destroy the quantum coherence of the internal states of the atoms , but effectively prolong the time they stay inside the laser beam(s ) .",
    "the processes of decoherence and redistribution of atomic population have been extensively studied in optical pumping experiments  @xcite .",
    "substantial narrowing of the dark resonance linewidth is reported in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the transformation of the transmission peaks corresponding to eit into enhanced absorption peaks for proper laser detuning .",
    "we present an extensive experimental and theoretical analysis of this effect , previously reported in  @xcite .",
    "we observe narrow enhanced absorption resonances in two experimental arrangements : in a bi - chrimatic configuration , where strong and weak laser fields form a @xmath0 scheme on two ground - state hyperfine sublevels ( fig .",
    "[ levels.fig]a ) , and in the degenerate hanle configuration ( fig .",
    "[ levels.fig]b ) .",
    "in both situation the eit resonance is observed for the laser field(s ) tuned to the atomic transition(s ) due to formation of a non - interacting ground - state atomic coherence ; in both cases the lineshape of this transmission peak persists for any value of the one - photon detuning unless a buffer gas is added to the rb vapor .",
    "rb atoms : the long - lived coherence is created on hyperfine ground - state sublevels with strong driving field @xmath5 and weak probe ( anti - stokes ) field @xmath6 ; the probe and stokes field @xmath7 are generated by electro - optic modulation .",
    "( b ) hanle configuration : the ground - state coherence is created on magnetic sublevels with two circularly polarized components @xmath8 of a monochromatic linearly polarized laser field . in both cases @xmath9 is the one - photon detuning of the laser(s ) from atomic resonance , and @xmath10 is the two - photon detuning due to frequency mismatch in case ( a ) or an external magnetic field in case ( b ) .",
    "[ levels.fig ] ]    before proceeding into the details of the experiment let us highlight the distinctions between the effect described below , and similarly looking coherent effects :    \\(i ) a transformation of enhanced transmission to enhanced absorption cpt resonance has been reported by affolderbach _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in their experiments with a bichromatic standing wave in hot atomic vapor .",
    "because of large doppler broadening , moving atoms effectively interact with a double-@xmath0 level configuration , which may result in either suppression or enhancement of absorption , depending on the relative phases of the driving fields .",
    "this explanation , however , can not be applied to the present experimental data , since our experiments are carried out with running waves .",
    "\\(ii ) narrow absorption resonances in alkali vapors are also the manifestation of electromagnetically induced absorption ( eia )  @xcite , or closely related enhanced absorption hanle effect  @xcite . in those experiments",
    ", a narrow absorption peak appears for two laser fields of close frequencies interacting with a quasi - degenerate two - level system .",
    "however , it is a general requirement in both cases that the degeneracy of the ground state must be lower than that of the excited state , i.e. @xmath11 , which prohibits any dark state formation .",
    "narrow eia resonances in this case are due to the spontaneous coherence transfer from the excited states of the atoms  @xcite . in addition , the experimental arrangements for traditional eia experiments involve laser fields resonant with the corresponding atomic transitions , whereas the narrow absorption resonances discussed in this paper appear for far - detuned laser fields .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , the effect described below can not be attributed to pressure induced extra resonances ( pier)(for a review of the collision - induced coherent effects see  @xcite ) . in pier",
    "the extra resonance is connected to a dressed state population that is non - vanishing only in the presence of collisions . a relatively low buffer gas pressure used in our experiment",
    "does not allow the realization of peir .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the experimental apparatus and measurement technique . in section",
    "iii we present the experimental study of these resonances in the three - level @xmath0 scheme based on the hyperfine coherence in atomic cells with different amounts of a buffer gas .",
    "theoretical analysis in given in section iv .",
    "resonant four - wave mixing and the lineshape of the associated resonances in a stokes field are discussed in section v. a brief analysis of the coherent resonances width is given in section vi . in section vii , we present the experimental results on the enhanced absorption resonances observed in the hanle - configuration , together with a qualitative discussion of the their origin .",
    "a brief summary of the work appears in the final section .",
    "a schematic of the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "[ simple_setup ] .",
    "an external cavity diode laser is tuned to the @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) transition of @xmath1rb .",
    "a probe field @xmath14 ( and an additional stokes field @xmath15 ) are produced by an electro - optic modulator ( eom ) driven by a stable narrow - band tunable microwave generator operating at 6.835  ghz to match the @xmath1rb ground - state hyperfine transition frequency .",
    "the probe and stokes fields have equal intensities of approximately @xmath16 of that of the drive field .",
    "after the eom , all fields pass through a single - mode optical fiber to create a clean spatial mode with a gaussian radial intensity distribution and to increase the diameter of the output beam to 7  mm .",
    "the fields are circularly polarized with a quarter - wave plate placed after the fiber .",
    "in this experiment we use several glass cells filled with isotopically enhanced @xmath1rb and various pressures and types ( ne , kr ) of a buffer gas .",
    "each cell is placed inside a 3-layer magnetic shield to screen the laboratory magnetic field from the system and is heated to @xmath17 c to increase the density of the @xmath1rb vapor to approximately @xmath18 . after traversing the cell , all three fields",
    "are mixed on a fast photodiode with an additional field shifted by 60  mhz with respect to the driving field .",
    "the resulting photo - current is measured with a spectrum analyzer to separate the transmission signals of the probe and stokes components ( see fig .",
    "[ simple_setup ] ) .",
    "this detection scheme has been described in  @xcite .    for our studies in the hanle configuration , the electro - optical modulator",
    "is removed so that there is only one linearly polarized monochromatic electromagnetic field propagating through the cell .",
    "the transmitted intensity is recorded directly from a photodetector .",
    "a longitudinal magnetic field for shifting the zeeman sublevels is created by a solenoid mounted inside the inner magnetic shield .     ]",
    "we start with the drive field resonant with @xmath19 transition ; simultaneously , the probe field couples the ground - state @xmath20 level to the same excited state . in that resonant @xmath0 system",
    "we observe expected narrow eit resonance in the probe field transmission due to efficient optical pumping into non - interacting dark state .",
    "the bottom row of fig .",
    "[ eit_shape_example ] shows the observed resonances for the cells with different amount of a buffer gas .",
    "it is easy to see that all eit peaks are nearly symmetric , which is in agreement with theoretical predictions  @xcite and our numerical simulations .",
    "the main difference between different cells is the narrowing the eit width resulting from the increased interaction time for higher buffer gas pressure .    as we tune the laser away from the atomic transition ( while maintaining near - zero two photon detuning ) the shape of the transmission resonance changes depending on the presence of a buffer gas in a cell .",
    "for the vacuum cell ( the rightmost column in fig .  [ eit_shape_example ] ) the resonance stays symmetric while its width increases rapidly with one - photon detuning @xmath9 due to less efficient density narrowing .    however , the behavior is very different in cells with a buffer gas . as @xmath9 increases ,",
    "the eit resonance becomes asymmetric , and then gradually transforms into a narrow _ absorption _ resonance .",
    "let us emphasize here some of the important properties of these resonances .",
    "for example , the cell with @xmath21  torr of ne ( fig .",
    "[ eit_shape_example ] ) shows that the amplitude of the enhanced absorption peak observed for large detuning ( @xmath22    2  ghz ) is comparable to , and sometimes larger than , the amplitude of the eit peak at @xmath23 , and its width is narrower .",
    "second , these narrow absorption resonances are observed for the laser detuning exceeding the doppler - broadened one - photon resonant absorption width ( @xmath24  ghz ) .",
    "thus , the enhanced absorption peaks appears on top of @xmath25 transmission of the probe field .",
    "the asymmetry in the eit resonances for nonzero one - photon detuning of the laser fields has been observed by levi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in maser emission in the cpt process as well as by knappe _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . however , the reported modification of the resonance lineshape is significantly weaker .",
    "et al . _ also suggested an empirical expression for the resonance line - shape : @xmath26 here @xmath10 is a two - photon ( raman ) detuning , @xmath27 is an effective width of the coherent resonance , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are fitting parameters which are functions of the one - photon detuning @xmath9 .",
    "we introduce a shift @xmath31 of the resonance position from the exact raman condition to reproduce the experimental data .",
    "one can see that this expression consists of symmetric and anti - symmetric lorentzian functions of @xmath10 with amplitudes @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively .",
    "parameter @xmath30 reflects the residual absorption of the electromagnetic field determined by incoherent processes .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite derived the analytical expressions for these coefficients in the limit of weak interaction fields ( perturbation approach ) .",
    "the case of the strong ( drive ) field is discussed in the next section .",
    "it is convenient to write the coefficients a and b in the following form : @xmath32 so that the eq .",
    "( [ res_shape_fit ] ) can be written as : @xmath33 in this case , the parameter @xmath34 characterizes the amplitude of the resonance , and the angle @xmath35 expresses the ratio between the symmetric and anti - symmetric components in eq .",
    "( [ res_shape_fit ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath36 represents a symmetric peak of enhanced transmission , @xmath37 corresponds to a symmetric peak of enhanced absorption , and @xmath38 corresponds to a pure dispersion - like lineshape .",
    "these parameters are shown as functions of one - photon detuning in different cells in figs .",
    "[ angle_as.fig ] and  [ amplit_as.fig ] .",
    "we note that no deviation from the symmetric lorentzian form is observed for the eit resonance in a vacuum cell ( @xmath36 for all detunings ) . however , buffered cells show the change from a symmetric transmission resonance ( for @xmath23 ) to almost symmetric absorption resonance for @xmath39  mhz for @xmath40  torr buffer gas pressure and @xmath41  ghz for @xmath21  torr buffer gas pressure . after reaching its maximum ,",
    "the angle starts to decline again , although we never observe the recovery of the symmetric eit peak for larger detunings .",
    "let us first give a brief pictorial explanation of the effect .",
    "the observation of the narrow absorption resonance for large laser detunings may be qualitatively understood by using dressed - state picture .",
    "it is known that the interaction of the drive field with the transition between levels @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be described as a splitting of the excited state  @xcite .",
    "[ dressedst.fig ] shows the interaction scheme for the probe beam in the case of the far - detuned drive field ( @xmath44 ) .    for that conditions the transition between one of the dressed states ( @xmath45 in our notation ) and level @xmath46 corresponds to a regular resonant absorption , and the transition between another dressed state @xmath47 and level @xmath46 corresponds to a two - photon raman transition .",
    "the destructive interference of two dressed states occurs only in case of zero two - photon detuning between probe and drive fields and corresponds to the frequency with zero absorption ( eit ) . for the ideal case of @xmath48 ( no ground state relaxation ) and assuming that all population is in level @xmath46 , the magnitudes of absorption and raman transition are the same while their widths are different : the width of the former is determined by the relaxation rate of optical coherence @xmath49 , while the width of the raman transition is given by @xmath50 and can be small for large @xmath9 .",
    "however , if spin relaxation is not zero , the amplitude of resonance dramatically decreases once the absorption resonance is narrower than this relaxation , and for @xmath51 the line disappears .",
    "the addition of a buffer gas , therefore , improves the conditions for the observation of that narrow resonance : higher buffer gas pressure produces additional pressure broadening of the excited state ( i.e. makes @xmath49 bigger ) and at the same time restricts the diffusion of rb atoms through the interaction region ( i.e. makes @xmath52 smaller ) ..    the dressed state picture provides a general idea about origin of the narrow absorption resonances .",
    "note , that the asymmetric lineshapes observed in the experiment can not be fitted by the combination of two symmetric lorentzian peaks  one positive due to coherent population trapping in the dark state and one negative due to the enhanced absorption by the bright state .",
    "the interference between two dressed state has to be taken into account for proper description of the coherent effects  @xcite .    for more rigorous analysis",
    "we derive an expression for the absorption coefficient of a weak probe field in rb atoms .",
    "it has been shown that a closed three - level @xmath0-scheme as shown in fig .",
    "[ levels-theory.fig ] provides satisfactory description of coherent effects in alkali atoms  @xcite .",
    "the propagation equations for the density matrix elements are well - known ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) and are the following : @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the rabi frequencies of the drive and probe fields .",
    "the generalized decay rates are defined as : @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the polarization decay rate , @xmath58  mhz is the radiative decay rate of the excited state , @xmath59 is the dephasing rate of the optical transition due to non - radiative effects ( @xmath60  mhz / torr  @xcite ) ; @xmath52 is the inverse lifetime of the coherence between ground states @xmath46 and @xmath43 , which is determined by the diffusion time of rb atoms through the interaction region and nonhomogeneity of the magnetic field due to imperfect screening .",
    "the presence of the buffer gas affects values of both @xmath52 and @xmath49 . on one hand",
    ", it allows for a longer ground - state coherence lifetime . on the other hand",
    "it broadens the optical transition , since @xmath59 grows linearly with buffer gas pressure  @xcite .    solving eqs.([rho_eit_eq_bia])-([rho_lambda_last_eq_bia ] ) in a steady state regime and assuming @xmath61 , we obtain the following expression for the linear susceptibility of the probe field : @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 is the @xmath1rb density and @xmath65 is the wavelength of the probe field .    the atomic population differences in the approximation of strong driving field ( @xmath66 )",

    "coefficient @xmath28 , which describes the symmetric component of the resonant lineshape is a symmetric function of the one - photon detuning .",
    "its sign changes as @xmath9 gets larger : @xmath28 is positive for small detunings , then it becomes negative at @xmath79 ( i.e. the resonance becomes absorptive ) .",

    "[ abc-comp.fig ] .",
    "one can immediately see that the theoretical formulae qualitatively describe the dependence of the coefficients as functions of one - photon detuning , although they are not accurate enough for a quantitative analysis .",
    "there are several reasons for this . on one hand",
    ", we will show below that the thermal velocity distribution of rb atoms is very important and has to be taken into account .",
    "on the other hand , we assumed for simplicity that the medium is optically thin which is not the case .",
    "one of the consequences of using optically thick medium is density narrowing of the eit resonances which will be discussed in the following section .",
    "we perform a numerical simulation of the interaction of the drive and probe field with the three - level @xmath0 system considered above .",
    "our model takes into account attenuation of both drive and probe fields as they propagate through rb vapor .",
    "the thermal motion of atoms also implies that atoms with different velocities `` see '' the electromagnetic fields at shifted frequencies , and the final susceptibility has to be averaged over the maxwell velocity distribution : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the drive field wave - vector , and @xmath82 is the most probable thermal speed ( here @xmath83 is the temperature of the vapor , @xmath84 is the mass of rb atom and @xmath85 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "the residual doppler broadening of the ground - state transition ( @xmath86 ) may be neglected due to lamb - dicke effect  @xcite .",
    "we can reproduce experimental spectra very accurately ( compare the experimental spectra presented in fig .",
    "[ eit_shape_example ] with the the results of numerical simulations in fig .",
    "[ eit_shape_calc ] ) except for the case of cells with small amount of a buffer gas ( @xmath87  torr ) .",
    "this limit corresponds to the regime where the mean free path of rb atoms is comparable with the size of the interaction region . under these conditions",
    "the motion of rb atoms in and out of the laser beam has to be taken into account when calculating the ground state coherence lifetime .",
    "unfortunately , this mechanism is beyond the theoretical model used in our numeric simulations .",
    "for that reason we do not show any calculated transmission spectra for the cell with @xmath40  torr of kr .",
    "the results of the numerical simulation for the parameters @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are shown in fig .",
    "[ abc-comp.fig]c .",
    "the calculated values of the resonance amplitude @xmath34 and the ratio @xmath35 are shown in figs .",
    "[ buf_vac_signal_theor ] and [ buf_vac_angle_theor ] .",
    "these demonstrate that the inversion of the eit resonance occurs in the cell with a buffer gas , whereas no absorption resonances ever appear in the cell without buffer gas .",
    "although a noticeable asymmetry of the resonance is expected for large laser detuning ( @xmath88 ) , the amplitude of the resonances is very small and hardly detectable .",
    "it is also easy to see in fig .",
    "[ eit_shape_example ] that for non - zero detuning @xmath9 the centers of both eit and buffer - gas induced absorption resonances are shifted from zero two - photon detuning .",
    "one of the reasons for this effect is light shifts of the atomic levels , as shown by eq .",
    "( [ delta0 ] ) .",
    "however , this expression fails to describe the behavior of the resonance shift measured experimentally ( fig .",
    "[ res_shift.fig ] ) . a more realistic resonance shift as a function of laser detuning is obtained by numerical simulation if doppler averaging is performed ( fig .",
    "[ res_shift.fig ] , inset ) .",
    "we note that both the prediction of the theoretical model and the result of the numerical simulations provide only qualitative agreement with the experimental results .",
    "there are several major effects which are not considered here .",
    "for example , neither hyperfine structure of the excited state nor zeeman substructure of all states are taken into consideration , although this may have a profound effect on the coherent interaction .",
    "in addition , no influence of the four - wave mixing processes is taken into account .",
    "for the better understanding of the conditions for which the enhanced absorption resonance occurs , we numerically compare the resonance lineshape at a large one - photon detuning ( @xmath89 ) for the cases of a cell with and without a buffer gas .",
    "we see that the absorption resonances appear only for large enough drive laser power @xmath90 in the cell with a buffer gas .",
    "in the cell without any buffer gas the resonance remains dispersion - like ( @xmath91 ) and vanishingly weak .",
    "so far we have completely ignored the presence of a stokes field @xmath15 in the medium .",
    "many previous publications  @xcite have shown that dense coherent media contribute to significant enhancement of nonlinear processes . in our experiment",
    "the strong drive field applied to the @xmath92 level is scattered by the ground - state coherence , which leads to the appearance of narrow resonances in the stokes field transmission with the width determined by the ground - state coherence relaxation rate . for near resonant probe and drive fields (",
    "@xmath93)the @xmath0 system formed by the stokes and the drive field applied to @xmath92 ground state level is far detuned ( see fig .",
    "[ levels.fig]a ) , and the effects of the associated ground - state coherence on the probe field are negligible .",
    "however , all four fields have to be taken into account in the case of large laser detuning , comparable with the ground state hyperfine splitting .",
    "the amplitude and the angle @xmath35 for the stokes field transmission resonance in the cell with @xmath21  torr of ne are shown in fig .",
    "[ angle_and_amplit_s ] .",
    "please note that for @xmath23 we observe a dispersion - like lineshape ( @xmath94 ) , which is different from the previously published experimental results for the stokes field generation initiated by spontaneous photons  @xcite . as the laser detuning @xmath9 increases the lineshape of the stokes field transmission changes , and the resonance",

    "the measured widths of the two - photon resonance @xmath96 as functions of the one - photon detuning @xmath9 are shown in fig .",
    "[ res_width ] for cells with different buffer gas pressure .",
    "again we see the difference between cells with and without a buffer gas : in the latter case the width of the eit resonance increases significantly with one - photon detuning .",
    "however , for the buffered cells the resonance is broadened only near atomic resonance , but for larger detuning its width actually decreases with @xmath9 .",
    "[ buf_vac_width_theor ] demonstrate that we may be able observe the narrowing of resonances for large detuning even in a vacuum cell . however according to fig .",
    "[ buf_vac_signal_theor ] at the point when narrowing takes place ( @xmath97 ) the amplitude of the resonance is so small that it is extremely hard to detect in the experiment .",
    "narrow resonances with good signal - to - noise ratio are important for many applications .",
    "for example , narrow eit resonances are used for precision metrology  @xcite and atomic clocks  @xcite .",
    "our experiments demonstrate that the coherent absorption resonances , observed for the far - detuned @xmath0 system , may have more attractive characteristics in terms of the resonance width and amplitude than the eit resonances observed for the zero detuning .",
    "for example , in the cell with @xmath21  torr of ne the amplitude of the absorption resonance for @xmath98@xmath99  ghz is larger than that of the eit resonance , while its width is narrower ( for example , @xmath100ghz@xmath101 ) .    according to eq .",
    "( [ width - theory ] ) in the strong laser field limit ( @xmath66 ) the width of the eit resonance for small @xmath9 does not depend on the ground - state coherence decay rate and is determined by power broadening : @xmath102 , as in previous studies  @xcite .",
    "the resonance width decreases with one - photon detuning , and for @xmath103 it drops as @xmath104 .",
    "ultimately for @xmath105 , the width of the resonance is determined by the coherence decay rate @xmath52 .    to describe the resonance width more carefully we again have to take into account the velocity distribution of rb atoms in the cell .",
    "also the variation of the laser fields intensities as they propagate through the optically dense rb vapor becomes important ; for example , the resonance width is reduced due to the density narrowing  @xcite .",
    "we note that both effects are not very important for the far - detuned optical fields ( @xmath106 ) since the absorption of the medium is small , and the parameters describing the resonance lineshape do not change noticeably within the doppler contour .",
    "thus , for large detuning the dependence of the resonance width predicted by eq .",
    "( [ width - theory ] ) is in good agreement with the experimental points , as shown in fig .",
    "[ res_width_both ] .    to describe how the resonance width changes for small @xmath9 we should take both propagation and doppler averaging into account . since it is virtually impossible to do that exactly",
    ", we make a few simplifications that allow us to roughly predict the dependence of the resonance width on one - photon detuning .",
    "first , we assume that the main contribution to the observed resonance comes from the velocity subgroup for which @xmath107 , i.e. the coupling fields are resonant with the atomic transitions",
    ". then the main consequence of the laser detuning is the reduction of the number of atoms in this velocity group : @xmath108 under these conditions the output intensity @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 in this expression the first term represents the residual absorption under eit conditions , and the second one describes the shape of the peak as a function of two - photon detuning .",
    "it is easy to see that the width of the resonance in this case is inversely proportional to the atomic density @xcite : @xmath111 substituting the density of the resonant atoms given by eq .",
    "( [ density ] ) we obtain the resonance width : @xmath112 fig .",
    "[ res_width_both ] shows that this formula works only for a small frequency region in the vicinity of one - photon resonance where the resonance is nearly symmetric and deviates for larger @xmath9 , which is consistent with the assumptions we made .    the width of the stokes field resonance is also shown in fig .",
    "[ res_width_both ] .",
    "it has approximately the same shape as the curve for the probe field , but it is worth mentioning that its width can be narrower than that of the probe field while having a similar resonance amplitude .",
    "let us now consider another kind of coherence effect originating from coherent population trapping , namely nonlinear magneto - optical polarization rotation . an extensive review of this effect is given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this case , the long - lived coherence is created among ground - state zeeman sublevels by a single electromagnetic field ( in general elliptically polarized but usually taken as linear in most experiments and analyses ) where the @xmath0 link(s ) are formed by the two opposite circularly polarized components @xmath113 of the input field ( fig .",

    "the ground state coherence is unperturbed and we denote the transmission as @xmath121 . dashed line : transmission at large magnetic field ( @xmath122 ) . in this case",
    "the coherence is destroyed , and we denote the transmission as @xmath123 . _ right column _ : the peak contrast in transmission as a function of magnetic field ( two - photon detuning ) for fixed laser frequency ( shown as a dotted line on the previous graphs ) for the same cells .",
    "the normalization of the output signal is @xmath124 .",
    "thus @xmath125 is a manifestation of eit shown in part ( d ) , and @xmath126 indicates enhanced absorption as seen in ( e ) and ( f ) . because of the difference in geometrical sizes of the cells , the atomic density is adjusted for each case so that @xmath127 .",
    "laser power is @xmath99  mw . [ zeeman.fig ] ]    the transmission spectrum of @xmath1rb @xmath128 consists of two transitions , partially resolved within the doppler contour as shown in fig .",
    "[ levels.fig]b .",
    "zeeman coherence can be created on both transitions so that linear absorption is suppressed for a linearly polarized electromagnetic field even if the laser frequency differs somewhat from the exact atomic transition frequency .",
    "for example , if the laser is tuned exactly between the two transitions ( @xmath129  mhz ) , the transmission is still enhanced by @xmath130 .",
    "this is true , however , only if there is no buffer gas present in the cell .",
    "the transmission spectra for different pressures of ne buffer gas are shown in fig .",
    "[ zeeman.fig]a , b , and c. one can easily see that the effect of eit deteriorates at higher buffer gas pressures",
    ". moreover , the enhanced absorption appears for the frequency region between the two transitions .",
    "when magnetic field is varied the width of the observed resonances is similar to that of eit peak as shown in fig .",
    "[ zeeman.fig]d , e , and f , which indicates that this effect is due to the ground - state coherence .",
    "similar resonances have been observed in the cells with anti - relaxation wall coating    here we should emphasize that the reason for the enhanced absorption resonances described in this section is quite different from the effects described in the previous sections , despite of their similarities ( both effects are observed only in buffered rb cells and for nonzero one - photon detunings ) . in the case of zeeman coherence , the nonlinear enhanced absorption may be explained by the interplay of the matrix elements of the transitions involved in the @xmath0 links . as the laser frequency changes , dark states can be created for both @xmath131 and @xmath132 transitions .",
    "however , because of the difference in relative sign in the transition matrix elements  @xcite , these dark states are orthogonal : @xmath133 strictly speaking , because of this difference perfect cpt is not possible in this double-@xmath0 system .",
    "however , the natural width of both transitions ( @xmath134  mhz ) is much smaller than their hyperfine splitting , and for the laser resonant with one transition , the disturbance introduced by the other transition may be neglected .",
    "for the cell without buffer gas or anti - relaxation coating , atoms do not change their velocity while moving through the laser beam and interact with the same atomic transition .",
    "therefore we observe two gaussian - shaped transmission peaks as the laser frequency is swept across the @xmath135 transitions .    in the presence of a buffer gas",
    "the situation is different .",
    "since the hyperfine structure of the excited level is not completely resolved under doppler broadening , there is a finite probability that an atom , optically pumped into the dark state on one transition , may later change its velocity and become resonant with the other transition .",
    "because of the sign difference , the previously prepared dark state becomes a bright state for that transition , and an atom absorbs light more readily than the one without coherence .",
    "thus , for the symmetric scheme as shown in fig .",
    "[ levels.fig]b , we would expect complete destruction of coherence for the laser tuned exactly between two atomic transitions , so that the probabilities of an atom interacting with either of them are equal .",
    "in reality , however , the @xmath136 transition is stronger then the @xmath137 transition , and this imbalance results in the enhanced absorption for a small region of laser frequencies .",
    "we have demonstrated significant changes of the eit resonance in warm rb vapor with a buffer gas .",
    "we showed that the resonance lineshape changes from symmetric transparency peak to a dispersion - like signal and then to nearly symmetric absorption peak as one - photon detuning of the laser fields from atomic transition increases .",
    "we also found that for large enough detuning , the resonance width was limited by the ground level coherence decay rate ( @xmath52 ) , and there is a region of laser frequencies with higher resonance contranst than for zero one - photon detuning , while the width of the resonance is narrower .",
    "observation of this absorption - like resonance is power dependent and takes place only for high enough drive power .",
    "we have also developed a simple theory and performed the numerical stimulations that qualitatively describe the observations , and we have accounted for the origin of the discrepancies between those and the experimental data .",
    "we compared the behavior of the probe and stokes field for large one - photon detuning , and showed that the resonance width of these two fields behaves similarly , while the shapes of the resonances are different .",
    "we have also shown that an induced absorption resonance appears with one - photon detuning in the hanle configuration , although its origin differes from the bichromatic case . in the hanle configuration , the enhanced absorption results from the destructive interference between the dark states created via different excited states in the presence of velocity changing collisions .",
    "the effects reported here differ from previously observed electromagnetically induced absorption resonances and the absorption hanle effect .",
    "both of those cases have strict requirements on selection rules that are not required or met for our observations .",
