    "a legal vertex coloring of a graph @xmath6 is an assignment of colors to its vertices such that no two adjacent vertices receive the same color .",
    "equivalently , a legal coloring of @xmath7 by @xmath0 colors is a partition of its vertices into @xmath0 independent sets .",
    "the minimum number of colors needed for such a coloring is called the chromatic number of @xmath7 , and is usually denoted by @xmath8 . determining the chromatic number of a graph",
    "is known to be np - hard ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    besides its theoretical significance as a canonical np - hard problem ,",
    "graph coloring arises naturally in a variety of applications such as register allocation  @xcite and timetable / examination scheduling  @xcite . in many applications that can be formulated as graph coloring problems , it suffices to find an _ approximately optimum _ graph coloring  a coloring of the graph with a small though non - optimum number of colors .",
    "this along with the apparent impossibility of an exact solution has led to some interest in the problem of approximate graph coloring .",
    "the analysis of approximation algorithms for graph coloring started with the work of johnson @xcite who shows that a version of the greedy algorithm gives an @xmath9-approximation algorithm for @xmath0-coloring .",
    "wigderson  @xcite improved this bound by giving an elegant algorithm that uses @xmath10 colors to legally color a @xmath0-colorable graph .",
    "subsequently , other polynomial time algorithms were provided by blum  @xcite that use @xmath11 colors to legally color an @xmath1-vertex 3-colorable graph .",
    "this result generalizes to coloring a @xmath0-colorable graph with @xmath12 colors .",
    "the best known performance guarantee for general graphs is due to halldrsson  @xcite who provided a polynomial time algorithm using a number of colors that is within a factor of @xmath13 of the optimum .",
    "recent results in the hardness of approximations indicate that it may be not possible to substantially improve the results described above .",
    "lund and yannakakis  @xcite used the results of arora , lund , motwani , sudan , and szegedy  @xcite and feige , goldwasser , lovsz , safra , and szegedy  @xcite to show that there exists a ( small ) constant @xmath14 such that no polynomial time algorithm can approximate the chromatic number of a graph to within a ratio of @xmath15 unless p @xmath16 np .",
    "the current hardness result for the approximation of the chromatic number is due to feige and kilian @xcite and hstad @xcite , who show that approximating it to within @xmath17 , for any @xmath18 , would imply np = rp ( rp is the class of probabilistic polynomial time algorithms making one - sided error ) .",
    "however , none of these hardness results apply to the special case of the problem where the input graph is guaranteed to be @xmath0-colorable for some small @xmath0 .",
    "the best hardness result in this direction is due to khanna , linial , and safra  @xcite who show that it is not possible to color a 3-colorable graph with 4 colors in polynomial time unless p @xmath16 np .    in this paper",
    "we present improvements on the result of blum .",
    "in particular , we provide a randomized polynomial time algorithm that colors a 3-colorable graph of maximum degree @xmath3 with @xmath19 colors ; moreover , this can be generalized to @xmath0-colorable graphs to obtain a coloring using @xmath20 or @xmath21 colors .",
    "besides giving the best known approximations in terms of @xmath1 , our results are the first non - trivial approximations given in terms of @xmath3 .",
    "our results are based on the recent work of goemans and williamson  @xcite who used an algorithm for _ semidefinite optimization problems _ ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to obtain improved approximations for the max cut and max 2-sat problems .",
    "we follow their basic paradigm of using algorithms for semidefinite programming to obtain an optimum solution to a relaxed version of the problem , and a randomized strategy for `` rounding '' this solution to a feasible but approximate solution to the original problem .",
    "motwani and naor  @xcite have shown that the approximate graph coloring problem is closely related to the problem of finding a cut cover of the edges of a graph .",
    "our results can be viewed as generalizing the max cut approximation algorithm of goemans and williamson to the problem of finding an approximate cut cover .",
    "in fact , our techniques also lead to improved approximations for the max @xmath0-cut problem  @xcite .",
    "we also establish a duality relationship between the value of the optimum solution to our semidefinite program and the lovsz @xmath5-function  @xcite .",
    "we show lower bounds on the gap between the optimum solution of our semidefinite program and the actual chromatic number ; by duality this also demonstrates interesting new facts about the @xmath5-function .",
    "alon and kahale  @xcite use related techniques to devise a polynomial time algorithm for 3-coloring random graphs drawn from a `` hard '' distribution on the space of all 3-colorable graphs .",
    "recently , frieze and jerrum  @xcite have used a semidefinite programming formulation and randomized rounding strategy essentially the same as ours to obtain improved approximations for the max @xmath0-cut problem with large values of @xmath0 .",
    "their results required a more sophisticated version of our analysis , but for the coloring problem our results are tight up to poly - logarithmic factors and their analysis does not help to improve our bounds .",
    "semidefinite programming relaxations are an extension of the linear programming relaxation approach to approximately solving np - complete problems .",
    "we thus present our work in the style of the classical lp - relaxation approach .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : relaxation ] by defining a relaxed version of the coloring problem . since we use a more complex relaxation than standard linear programming",
    ", we must show that the relaxed problem can be solved ; this is done in section  [ sec : solution ] .",
    "we then show relationships between the relaxation and the original problem . in section  [ sec : bound ] , we show that ( in a sense to be defined later ) the value of the relaxation bounds the value of the original problem .",
    "then , in sections  [ sec : semicoloring ] ,  [ sec : plane ] ,  and  [ sec : rounding ] , we show how a solution to the relaxation can be `` rounded '' to make it a solution to the original problem . combining the last two arguments",
    "shows that we can find a good approximation .",
    "section  [ sec : solution ] , section  [ sec : bound ] , and sections  [ sec : semicoloring][sec : rounding ] are in fact independent and can be read in any order after the definitions in section  [ sec : relaxation ] . in section  [ sec : duality ] , we investigate the relationship between our fractional relaxations and the lovsz @xmath5-function , showing that they are in fact dual to one another .",
    "we investigate the approximation error inherent in our formulation of the chromatic number via semi - definite programming in section  [ sec : tightness ] .",
    "in this section , we describe the relaxed coloring problem whose solution is in turn used to approximate the solution to the coloring problem . instead of assigning colors to the vertices of a graph",
    ", we consider assigning ( @xmath1-dimensional ) unit _ vectors _ to the vertices . to capture the property of a coloring",
    ", we aim for the vectors of adjacent vertices to be `` different '' in a natural way .",
    "the _ vector @xmath0-coloring _ that we define plays the role that a hypothetical `` fractional @xmath0-coloring '' would play in a classical linear - programming relaxation approach to the problem .",
    "our relaxation is related to the concept of an orthonormal representation of a graph  @xcite .    given a graph @xmath22 on @xmath1 vertices , and a real number @xmath23 , a _ vector @xmath0-coloring _ of @xmath7 is an assignment of unit vectors @xmath24 from the space @xmath25 to each vertex @xmath26 , such that for any two adjacent vertices @xmath27 and @xmath28 the dot product of their vectors satisfies the inequality @xmath29    the definition of an _ orthonormal representation _",
    "@xcite requires that the given dot products be equal to zero , a weaker requirement than the one above .",
    "in this section we show how the vector coloring relaxation can be solved using semidefinite programming .",
    "the methods in this section closely mimic those of goemans and williamson  @xcite .",
    "to solve the problem , we need the following auxiliary definition .    given a graph @xmath30 on @xmath1 vertices , a _ matrix @xmath0-coloring _ of the graph is an @xmath31 symmetric positive semidefinite matrix @xmath32 , with @xmath33 and @xmath34 if @xmath35 .",
    "we now observe that matrix and vector @xmath0-colorings are in fact equivalent ( cf .",

    "moreover , a vector @xmath36-coloring can be constructed from a matrix @xmath0-coloring in time polynomial in @xmath1 and @xmath37 .",
    "note that an exact solution can not be found , as some of the values in it may be irrational .    given a vector @xmath0-coloring @xmath38 ,",
    "the matrix @xmath0-coloring is defined by @xmath39 . for the other direction",
    ", it is well known that for every symmetric positive definite matrix @xmath32 there exists a square matrix @xmath40 such that @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the transpose of @xmath40 ) .",

    "in this section , we show that our vector coloring problem is a useful relaxation because the solution to it is related to the solution of the original problem . in order to understand the quality of the relaxed solution , we need the following geometric lemma :    [ kcolourable ] for all positive integers @xmath0 and @xmath1 such that @xmath66 , there exist @xmath0 unit vectors in @xmath25 such that the dot product of any distinct pair is @xmath67 .    clearly it suffices to prove the lemma for @xmath68 .",

    "note , however , that the dot product of each vector with the all-1 s vector is 0 .",
    "this shows that all k of the vectors are actually in a ( k-1)-dimensional hyperplane of the k - dimensional space .",

    "this implies that the scaling factor for @xmath98 is at least @xmath103 .",
    "thus , @xmath104    a simple induction using the above lemma shows that any graph containing a @xmath105-clique is not @xmath0-vector colorable .",
    "thus the `` vector chromatic number '' lies between between the clique and chromatic number .",
    "this also shows that the analysis of lemma  [ kcolourable ] is tight in that @xmath52 is the minimum possible value of the maximum of the dot - products of @xmath0 vectors .    in the next few sections we prove the harder part ,",

    "given the solution to the relaxed problem , our next step is to show how to `` round '' the solution to the relaxed problem in order to get a solution to the original problem . both of the rounding techniques we present in the following sections produce the coloring by working through an almost legal _ semicoloring _ of the graph , as defined below .",

    "@xmath194      we are now ready to complete the specification of the coloring algorithm . recall that our goal is to repeatedly strip away large independent sets from the graph",
    "we actually set an easier intermediate goal : find an induced subgraph with a large number @xmath168 of vertices and a number @xmath195 of edges .",
    "given such a graph , we can delete one endpoint of each edge to leave an independent set on @xmath196 vertices that can be colored and removed .    as discussed above , to find this sparse graph , we choose a random vector @xmath135 and take all vertices whose dot product with @xmath135 exceeds a certain value @xmath197 .",

    "in such a set , at least @xmath205 of the vertices have no incident edges , and thus form an independent set .",
    "we would like this independent set to be large .",
    "clearly , we need to make @xmath200 small enough to ensure @xmath206 , meaning @xmath207 .",
