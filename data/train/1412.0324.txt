    "one of the fundamental distance determination methods within the milky way galaxy is the method of main sequence fitting .",
    "after several decades of work by hundreds ( or thousands ) of astronomers , we believe we know the absolute magnitudes of single stars of a given age and metallicity . since some stars in clusters are actually unresolved binaries , we can account for a `` leakage '' of stars in a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) to brighter values .",
    "still , if we know which objects are bona fide members of a cluster , there should be a sharper blue edge to the main sequence .",
    "blue stragglers and stars along the same line of sight at other distances contribute to some raggedness of the blue edge .",
    "the bottom line is that we can determine the distances of clusters relative to the hyades , whose distance we know from the moving cluster method @xcite or , better still , from hipparcos parallaxes @xcite .",
    "thus , we can determine the distances to the clusters using broad band photometry .",
    "as always , reddening can be problematic .",
    "it is our assumption that stars in a cluster are born at about the same time and all have about the same composition .",
    "we are therefore intrigued by the recent finding that some _ globular _ clusters show evidence of two , or even three , main sequences @xcite . to our knowledge",
    "there is no known open cluster that shows clear evidence of multiple stages of star formation .    since the publication of the catalogue of open clusters of @xcite and its supplements , the number of clusters has risen from 945 to more than 2000 @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that fewer than 10 percent of 2174 catalogued open clusters have their metallicity determined in the literature .    in this paper",
    "we present johnson @xmath0 photometry and photometry using filters of the sloan digital sky survey @xcite .",
    "we have selected six clusters that have been poorly studied and one that , to our knowledge , has no published optical or near - ir photometry .",
    "we apply to the data the cross - entropy technique , first introduced by @xcite , with the objective of estimating probabilities of rare events in complex stochastic networks , as previously done by @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "the analysis uses a weighted likelihood criterion to define the goodness of fit and global optimization ( i.e. cross - entropy ) to find the best fit isochrones . for each cluster",
    "we derive the distance , age , @xmath5 color excess , and metallicity . for four clusters with moderate color excess",
    "we also derive r@xmath6 = a@xmath6/e(@xmath5 ) , which we set as a free parameter .",
    "the clusters studied make a relevant contribution towards the establishement of a large sample of objects that have fundamental parameters , if not the observational data itself , determined in a homogenous way .",
    "such a sample can be important in studies of galactic structure and evolution .    in this paper",
    "we adopt a solar metallicity of z = 0.019 , the value adopted for the set of isochrones of @xcite , which we use .",
    "the isochrone set of @xcite was chosen because of its widespread use in the literature as well as its ease of use and implementation in our code .",
    "we refer the reader to that work for details and dicussion of the assumptions made by the authors .",
    "the distance of the sun from the galactic center is taken to be 8.0 kpc @xcite .",
    "basic information for the clusters observed is given in table [ clusters ] .",
    "details of the images used for this paper are given in table [ exptimes ] , in the appendix .",
    "the appendix also gives transformation equations from instrumental magnitudes and colors to standardized values , and the reduction coefficients assumed and derived .",
    "ngc 2482 ( originally designated h vii 10 ) was discovered by william herschel on 20 november 1784 with his 19-inch diameter reflector of 20-ft focal length ( * ? ? ? * on p. 496 ) .",
    "he described it as , `` a very large cluster of scattered stars extremely rich and compressed , more than 15@xmath7 in diameter . ''",
    "according to @xcite ngc 2482 has an _ apparent _ distance modulus of 10.93 mag ( meaning that extinction has not been taken into account ) , a distance of 1343 pc , a color excess e(@xmath5 ) = 0.093 mag , an age of 400 myr , and an iron abundance of [ fe / h ] = + 0.12 dex .",
    "this abundance value is based on cmt@xmath8t@xmath9 washington broad - band photometry of three giant stars by @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite determined the metallicity of one of those stars , star 9 in the list of ( * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite provide @xmath11 magnitudes , @xmath5 and @xmath12 colors of 41 stars in the direction of ngc 2482 .",
    "seventeen of the stars are designated non - members of the cluster .",
    "five of the 41 stars are considerably to the west ( up to 15@xmath7 ) of the center of the cluster , near bx puppis ; one of these has photometry consistent with it being a cluster member .",
    "most of the stars are distributed over a triangular region about 14@xmath7 by 11@xmath7 by 12@xmath7 in angular size .    according to @xcite , `` the [ color - magnitude diagram ] of @xcite is too ill - defined to permit a reliable distance determination . using the ddo modulus adjusted for the hyades distance ,",

    "ruprecht 42 , 51 , 153 and 154 are listed by @xcite .",
    "references cited in that work provide more information . prior to our observations and analysis presented here , we were aware of no published photographic photometry , photoelectric photometry , or ccd photometry of these five clusters .",
    "the data presented in this paper were obtained by one of us ( kk ) at las campanas observatory ( lco ) using the 1-m henrietta swope telescope .",
    "three second exposures of ngc 2482 were obtained in @xmath14 on 6 january 2012 ( ut ) , along with a 24 second @xmath15-band exposure .",
    "longer @xmath0 exposures of 150 and 120 seconds , respectively , were taken on 21 december 2012 ( ut ) .",
    "for the ngc 2482 images we used the central 1201 @xmath16 1201 pixels of the ccd chip then in use .",
    "the pixel scale is 0.435 arc seconds ; the field size is 8.7 by 8.7 arc minutes .",
    "the other clusters were observed from 31 december 2013 to 4 january 2014 ( ut ) using a new ccd camera having four 2k by 2k chips .",
    "we observed all targets with chip number 3 , offsetting 300 arcsec north and east of the center of the four chip array .",
    "we found after the fact that the point spread function ( psf ) is good for chip 3 for x and y ranging from about 600 to 2048 pixels .",
    "along the left and bottom of chip 3 , furthest from the center of the camera field of view , the psf contours can significantly deviate from circularity .",
    "this is particularly the case for @xmath17-band images .",
    "we derived positions and magnitudes for stars over the whole of chip 3 , but for the analysis of the clusters we restricted ourselves to a subset of the area covered . given the angular size of the clusters ,",
    "this feature of the psf actually did not come into play in a significant way .",
    "the pixel scale is the same , so these images are 14.8 by 14.8 arc minutes in size .    for these five clusters we typically took one exposure per filter at or near the limit of the shortest exposure possible ( 5 seconds ) , and one or two exposures that were much longer ( up to 120 sec ) .",
    "this minimizes the number of saturated stars and expands the dynamic range of the photometry .",
    "the data presented here were all obtained on photometric nights , though on some occasions the seeing was worse at the start of the night .",
    "we observed standards of @xcite and @xcite on five or six occasions each night .",
    "= 9 mm      not only is ngc 2482 a good candidate for modern analysis , but its brightest stars did not reach the non - linear response level or saturation level of the shortest exposures possible with the ccd camera installed on the las campanas 1-m swope telescope through 2012 .",
    "this cluster was previously studied by @xcite using single channel photoelectric photometry .",
    "our psf photometry , obtained from images of 6 january 2012 , is given in table [ photometry ] .",
    "we give @xmath11 and @xmath18 magnitudes and four photometric colors .",
    "the coordinates of the ngc 2482 stars in table [ photometry ] were determined using ccmap and cctran in the imcoords package of iraf .",
    "we used the x - y pixel coordinates of 10 stars distributed over the whole field and the right ascensions and declinations from a digital sky survey image displayed with ds9 to obtain the transformation solution .    in table",
    "[ ids ] we show the correspondence of our i d s and those of @xcite .",
    "there are 17 single stars in common . with `` @xmath19 '' in the sense `` our aperture photometry _ minus _ that of @xcite '' , we find @xmath20 ( @xmath11)@xmath21 = + 0.024 mag , with a standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath10 0.035 .",

    "11 of our 114 stars are obvious non - cluster members .",
    "they are presumably red giants at other distances .",
    "the brightest star in the field ( our star 166 ) is a bona fide giant in the cluster .",
    "as noted above , the other five clusters were observed with a new ccd camera using a larger chip , but with the same plate scale .",
    "for these clusters we obtained photometry of a total of 3871 stars that satisfied the s / n criteria .",
    "the coordinates of the stars ( in decimal degrees , and pixel coordinates ) and the derived @xmath23 photometry can be obtained by the reader via this link : people.physics.tamu/krisciunas/clusters.tar , which also contains data for 114 stars of ngc 2482 derived from psf photometry . in the final column of each of these files",
    "we flag the stars most likely to be cluster members ( normalized probability greater than 50 percent ) .",
    "the coordinates given in the files are basically for the purpose of identification , not for astrometric studies requiring extreme accuracy .",
    "it is customary in star cluster studies to rely primarily on psf photometry .",
    "this makes sense , as most open clusters are found at low galactic latitude .",
    "there can be thousands of stars in the field , resulting in severe challenges for aperture photometry . to obtain the instrumental psf magnitudes of our stars",
    ", we used a stand alone version of daophot @xcite and allstar .",
    "it is straightforward to keep track of the pixel coordinates and instrumental magnitudes , and adjust those magnitudes to the equivalent values for a 1.0 second exposure .",
    "however , instead of using daomatch and daomaster , we wrote our own fortran software to cross - correlate the frames taken in different filters .",
    "we used the following selection criteria .",
    "we were interested in stars observed in _ all _ filters , 18-@xmath24 ( or more ) above the sky level in the @xmath15-band , and 30-@xmath24 ( or more ) above the sky level in the other filters .",
    "these selection criteria had the effect of eliminating many stars that are very red in @xmath25 and much redder than the main sequence of each cluster studied .    we should mention that one particular advantage of psf photometry is that we can exploit our knowledge of the psf to obtain a higher signal to noise ratio ( s / n ) for faint stars .",
    "we can dig deeper into the image .",
    "this is not too relevant to this paper however , since we wanted photometry accurate to 0.06 mag or better , so we limited ourselves to relatively bright stars , where the turnoff point of an open cluster typically lies .",
    "aperture photometry has its own advantages . providing that the software aperture radius is sufficiently large ( for the lco 1-m we find this to be typically 8 pixels )",
    ", accurate photometry can be ensured on photometric nights even if the psf is considerably non - circular .",
    "the iraf package apphot subtracts the sky level using a settable annulus , and if one uses the _",
    "counts in that annulus , cosmic ray hits or the presence of other stars in the annulus have no effect on the results .",
    "we typically used a sky annulus ranging from 12 to 20 pixels .",
    "thus , aperture photometry _ can _ be used in moderately crowded fields .    using the ccdred package in iraf we bias - corrected our images using a nightly master bias frame , flattened and trimmed them .",
    "the quality of each night was evaluated with observations of standards of @xcite and @xcite . for this",
    "we used the photcal package in iraf .",
    "this gave us photometric zero points and color terms .",
    "( see appendix a and table [ transform_params ] . )",
    "if the standards were observed over a sufficiently wide range of air mass , we also derived the atmospheric extinction and reddening terms .",
    "we did this for each night using the instrumental magnitudes of the standards derived from aperture photometry _ and _ from psf photometry .",
    "not surprisingly , the color terms and atmospheric terms were the same , within the errors , using the two methods .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes from psf photometry ( adjusted to a 1 second exposure time ) are typically 0.02 to 0.04 mag brighter than the instrumental magnitudes from aperture photometry using an 8 pixel radius aperture .",
    "the psf magnitudes include light most or all of the wings of the profile .",
    "and so the photometric zero points for transformations like eqn .",
    "1 are different by such an amount .",
    "one would have to use a very large software aperture to include `` all '' of the flux for the aperture magnitudes , and this greatly increases the chances of including other stars in the aperture .",
    "our motivation here was to have the most robust reduction parameters to convert the psf magnitudes and colors to standardized values using simple awk scripts operating on our text files of raw psf data .    in fig .",
    "[ finder ] we show a finder chart of 114 stars of ngc 2482 that were brighter than 18-@xmath24 above the sky level in the @xmath15-band , and 30-@xmath24 above the sky level in the other filters .",
    "given the field size in pixels , this amounts to one `` bright '' star , on average , for every 112 by 112 pixel square of the image .",
    "surely , by avoiding obvious close pairs , the results of aperture photometry and psf photometry should be comparable .",
    "a comparison of photometry done with the two methods is shown in fig .",
    "[ pm_comp ] .",
    "aperture photometry of stars fainter than @xmath26 13.2 was obtained on 21 december 2012 .",
    "all psf photometry comes from 6 january 2012 .",
    "we have also accounted for a systematic error of 78 msec in the shutter time of the older camera at the lco 1-m telescope ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix a ) .",
    "[ pm_comp ] shows that there are no significant trends in the differences of aperture and psf photometry of ngc 2482 down to @xmath26 15.7 .",
    "the scatter of the individual differences increases , as expected , at fainter magnitudes , but the data are consistent to 0.06 mag or better .",
    "we note that if one s ultimate goal is to produce color - magnitude diagrams , the internal errors are smaller for the colors if one sets up the data reduction to produce one magnitude and multiple colors using transformations specified in the configuration file ( e.g in fitparams in iraf ) . in our experience at cerro tololo and lco we find that the rms scatter of the photometry of the standards on a photometric night is typically @xmath100.025 mag in @xmath11 , and @xmath100.015 to 0.020 mag for @xmath5 colors .",
    "( these uncertainties should be added in quadrature to the internal random errors of the program objects . )",
    "if one configures fitparams and evalfit to produce @xmath17-band magnitudes directly , the rms error might be @xmath100.025 mag or more .",
    "if one _ then _ obtains the @xmath5 colors by subtracting @xmath11 magnitudes from @xmath17 magnitudes , simple statistics stipulates that we would obtain uncertainties of @xmath100.035 mag or more , roughly twice the rms scatter for the colors obtained the other way using the same instrumental magnitudes .",
    "this is not a critical issue for stellar photometry , but it is something one should consider .",
    "the cross - entropy technique applied to the isochrone fits done in this work is described in detail in a series of papers . see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it eliminates much of the subjectivity inherent in open cluster fitting . using @xmath23 photometry",
    ", it simultaneously solves for the reddening , distance , age , and metallicity of a cluster using an estimation of membership likelihood as described by @xcite .",
    "a new feature of the program implemented in this work is that if the color excess of a cluster is greater than some settable value ( we chose 0.1 mag ) , a value of r@xmath6 = a@xmath6/e(@xmath5 ) is also derived .",
    "otherwise , r@xmath6 = 3.1 is assumed .",
    "the multi - parameter space considered is as follows : 1 ) log ( age in years ) from 6.60 to 10.15 in steps of 0.05 ; 2 ) 1 to 10,000 pc in distance ; 3 ) e(@xmath5 ) from 0.0 to 3.0 mag ; 4 ) metallicity from 0.0001 to 0.03 in steps of 0.05 in log z ; and 5 ) r@xmath6 from 2.0 to 6.0 . from a detailed analysis of nine well studied open clusters @xcite show that their technique works well .",
    "since the determination of the age of the cluster depends most critically on the hottest main sequence stars , those just past the turnoff point , and the red giants of the cluster , the lower main sequence stars are not critical but do help in constraining the general shape of the main sequence , especially with the @xmath27-band data . as a result , we may either set a limit on the faintest stars to consider , or let the program eliminate from consideration the stars fainter than the maximum of a histogram of the @xmath11-band magnitudes , so as to have a sample reasonably complete to some brightness level .",
    "an extra piece of information we have on each star is its angular distance from the cluster center . if the images are sufficiently big to cover the whole extent of the cluster , the program can derive the most likely location of the center from the peak of a density map obtained with a gaussian kernel of predefined width .",
    "one of the few arbitrary ( but settable ) parameters is the assumed fraction of unresolved binaries . with one exception we adopted 50 percent for this fraction .",
    "for ngc 2482 we adopted 40 percent for this fraction , as we found that it slightly improved the likelihood measure of our solution .",
    "then , using a @xcite mass function , we performed monte carlo simulations to pick at random the particulars of the companions .",
    "carrying out a number of runs ( typically 50 ) gives us the uncertainties of our derived parameters .",
    "which stars are assigned binary status varies from run to run .",
    "finally , in crowded fields with many giant star interlopers , some additional cuts by hand might be necessary on the basis of angular distance from the cluster center , the colors of the stars in the field and other data .    concerning the reality of our targets being bona fide clusters , two of our targets ( ruprecht 153 and 154 ) were problematic , owing in part to the distribution of non - cluster stars in the field .",
    "this is a limitation of our method . for very crowded fields our procedure may fail to assign low weights to non - member stars solely on the basis of photometric data . in fig .",
    "[ density ] we show a comparison of the density maps of the six clusters . for ruprecht 153 we used a gaussian kernel with @xmath28 . for the other clusters we used a kernal of 1 .    for ruprecht 154 we ran 100 iterations of the bootstrap procedure in order to sample better the distribution of solutions .",
    "the results show a clear double peaked distribution for the ages and non - gaussian distributions for distance and reddening .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ rup154-hists ] , where we also present a 2d histogram in age versus distance showing that in this parameter space there are two well defined solutions with distinct ages and slightly different distances .",
    "the solution of lower age and distance seems to be the most probable , which is what we adopt .",
    "however , the results can be alternatively interpreted as two superimposed populations . due to the small number of stars that have high likelihood of being cluster members , the results seem to be inconclusive for ruprecht 154 , since we can not rule out the possibility of chance alignment in the plane of the sky .",
    "a visual inspection of the proper motion vectors for the fields of both ruprect 153 and ruprecht 154 seem consistent with the latter hypothesis . given all these considerations we believe that ruprecht 153 and 154 warrant further study , including detailed analysis using proper motions , to better define their fundamental parameters or even their open cluster status .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "results for the clusters observed are to be found in table [ results ] .",

    "this of course is not the case for real clusters where we have no `` true '' value to compare the fit results to . in this context",
    "our error estimates can be said to be precise , given the size of the errors relative to the parameters determined . however , this is completely dependent on the characteristics of the data used .",
    "so for a dataset that has many stars with low contamination , or contamination that can be removed easily , we will have very precise results , that is , with small error .",
    "the errors we quote are related to the precision of the _ fit_. in other words , for a given dataset and likelihood function , weights , and isochrone grid assumptions used , the errors quoted are the standard deviations of the distribution of solutions obtained from the bootstrap procedure .    as we were finishing this paper we learned of the catalogue of 3006 bona fide objects of @xcite , which contains entries for five of our six clusters : ngc 2482 , ruprecht 42 , 51 , 153 , and 154 .",
    "their parameters for ngc 2482 are in agreement with our results thanks to previously published optical data by @xcite , but their parameters for the four ruprecht clusters differ considerably from ours . for example , their entry for ruprecht 154 gives a color excess e(@xmath5 ) = 0.781 mag and an age of 14 myr , while we obtain 0.087 mag and 2.2 gyr , respectively , for the same cluster !",

    "an attempt by us to fit the near - ir data of ruprecht 154 also yielded no scientific fruit .",

    "since @xcite have based some of their catalogue entries on 2mass data , without the use of optical photometry , the reader should treat some of the individual entries of their catalogue with caution .",
    "we have presented broad band photometry of six galactic open clusters , four of which were poorly studied ( no optical ccd photometry ) and one that has never been studied before . using the cross - entropy method applied to the fitting of theoretical isochrones to photometric data as detailed by @xcite , for each cluster we have derived the age , distance , reddening , and metallicity , with robust error bars .",
    "four of our six clusters , those less than 1.3 kpc beyond the sun s distance from the galactic center , have metallicity slightly greater than that of the sun ( @xmath36z@xmath21 = 0.022 @xmath10 0.002 ) , while two of our clusters beyond this distance have lower than solar metallicity ( @xmath36z@xmath21 = 0.012 @xmath10 0.003 ) .",
    "the individual values , converted to [ fe / h ] in the usual way , are consistent with the step function found by @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "as mentioned by @xcite , only about 10 percent of 2174 catalogued open clusters have published values of metallicity .",
    "many of these are obtained from spectroscopy , which is the preferred method .",
    "however , observationaly , this is a costly endeavor and alternatives that allow for the determination of the metallicity for a large number of clusters are desirable . in this context , values determined from photometry as done in this work can have an important impact in the research fields that use metallicity as a tool .",
    "efforts to complete the catalog may lie far in the future and may require a large scale galactic plane survey , something that may soon be possible using modern instruments and techniques . the tools and procedures such as those used in this work will surely be important in that scenario .",
    "we suggest three worthwhile follow up endeavors : 1 ) obtain high resolution spectra of several stars brighter than @xmath26 14 in ngc 2482 that are @xmath37 0.3 mag redder or bluer than the median colors of other presumed main sequence stars of comparable brightness .",
    "this will shed light on the issue of unresolved binaries .",
    "2 ) a much bigger project is to obtain accurate proper motions of our six clusters in order to eliminate obvious non - cluster stars .",
    "since the mean proper motions of these clusters are only a few milliarcsec per year , this will be a challenge .",
    "3 ) carry out a detailed analysis of the spatial and kinematical structure of the galaxy .",
