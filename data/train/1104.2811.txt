    "<S> it is informative to draw a phase diagram , indicating the region in parameter space where the ground state is of the polaron variety . </S>",
    "<S> there are two conditions that have to be met . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , as we have discussed above , the coupling constant must be large enough , i.e. @xmath109 </S>",
    "<S> . there is however another condition : the deflection @xmath110 of the tube s free tip must be much smaller than the length @xmath16 of the suspended section . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath111 , the tube will likely come into contact with one of the surrounding elements of the setup , for instance the supporting substrate at @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> owing to van der waals forces the tube will adhere to whatever it comes in contact with . </S>",
    "<S> when this happens , the coupling between electron motion and tube profile is destroyed . </S>",
    "<S> of course , when this condition is not met , the small deflection approximation , on which our analysis relied , also breaks down . </S>",
    "<S> appendix  [ app5 ] provides more detail . in figure [ f4 ] </S>",
    "<S> we show three cuts through the phase diagram in the @xmath87@xmath16 plane , for @xmath113 and @xmath106 nm respectively . in each case </S>",
    "<S> the polaron phase is indicated by a shaded region . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the value of the largest allowed electric field is always several orders of magnitude larger than the smallest allowed electric field .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we found that the coupling between the electron and the tube is controlled by a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath47 . at strong coupling ( large @xmath53 ) </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the system is a polaron , i.e. the electron is trapped in the deformation of the cantilever that it itself produces . </S>",
    "<S> as the coupling is decreased beyond the critical value of @xmath83 , a first order phase transition occurs . below the transition point </S>",
    "<S> , the ground state consists of an undeformed tube and an extended electron wave function . for realistic values </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 @xmath1 m for the length of the suspended tube and @xmath6 nm for the tube radius , an electric field of @xmath7 v/@xmath1 m is required to realize the polaron phase and the critical tip displacement is @xmath8 nm . the magnitude of the threshold electric field is the same as that produced by an image charge in a metallic substrate @xmath9 @xmath1 m below the cantelever .    in future work </S>",
    "<S> we plan to study the nonlinear dynamics of a single polaron as well as the interaction between polarons in the same or adjacent suspended tubes . </S>",
    "<S> the eventual aim is to exploit the coupling between mechanical and electrical degrees of freedom for the coherent manipulation of the quantum state of the polaron . </S>"
