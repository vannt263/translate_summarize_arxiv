    "because of their proximity and comparatively well - known distances , the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc , respectively ) are the ideal places to study stellar evolution . to search for the gravitational lensing events , several projects are now underway monitoring the sky toward the magellanic clouds and also the galactic bulge , where there are a large number of background stars that are potential targets for microlensing . as the natural by - products of these surveys , many variable stars were newly found .",
    "the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) project is one of such surveys and its @xmath2 band time - series data in the magellanic clouds ( @xcite ) obtained during four years of ogle - ii run ( @xcite ; january 1997 - november 2000 ) is now available over the internet ( ogle homepage ; http://sirius.astrouw.edu.pl/@xmath3ogle/ ) .    to detect dust - enshrouded variables that have possibly escaped from the ongoing / previous optical projects , we started the @xmath0 monitoring survey toward the large and small magellanic clouds using the infrared survey facility ( irsf ) at the south african astronomical observatory sutherland station .",
    "the irsf consists of a dedicated 1.4 m telescope to which is attached a near infrared ( nir ) camera sirius , which can observe the sky in the three wave bands ( @xmath4 ) simultaneously .",
    "the filter characteristics are shown in table  [ filter ] .",
    "the field of view of this system is about 7.7@xmath5@xmath67.7@xmath5 with a scale of 0.453@xmath7/pixel .",
    "details of the instrument are found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this campaign was initiated in december 2000 , and so far , many dust - enshrouded variables were found and their light variation data has been steadily accumulating ( see @xcite for the first results ) .",

    "i , we classified variable stars into nine ( lmc ) and eight ( smc ) prominent groups based on their locations on the period-@xmath8 magnitude plane .",
    "refer to paper i for the details of the grouping . for the easier reading and completeness of this paper",
    ", we show the period-@xmath8 magnitude diagram with classification boxes in figure  [ plk ] , and also for conciseness , we tabulated the colour mapping chart in table  [ colourmap ] .",
    "stars outside the classification boxes are represented by black tiny dots . throughout this paper",
    ", we use the same labels and colours for each group . in the lmc",
    ", there is a clump of variables around @xmath9 @xmath100.1 and @xmath11 15.0 .",
    "this is a group of rr lyrae variables , which we do not analyze in this paper .",
    "roughly speaking , five types of variable stars constitute the majority of the catalog ; cepheids , miras , semi - regulars , irregular variables and eclipsing binaries .",
    "however , telling semi - regulars from mira variables is rather difficult and there are not necessarily deep physical criteria . several authors ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite )",
    "use a simple criterion that is based on a certain limiting pulsation amplitude to separate semi - regulars and miras .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite showed that there is a good correlation between the amplitude and mode of pulsation . in this paper , we do not separate semi - regulars and miras explicitly . instead , we distinguish `` regularly pulsating variables , ( @xmath12 0.55 ) '' from `` less regularly pulsating variables , ( @xmath13 ) '' relying on the parameter `` @xmath14 '' . in figures  [ largetheta ] and [ smalltheta ] , we show the representative light curves of two variable stars on sequence @xmath15 , having similar periods ( @xmath16109 and @xmath16126 days ) and the same amplitudes ( @xmath170.490 mag ) but different @xmath14s .",

    "@xmath20 stars in the lmc ( smc ) have these properties .",
    "a possible explanation for these red stars in the group @xmath20 is that , these stars could in fact be very dusty agb stars that are subjected to severe circumstellar extinctions , even in the @xmath8 band .",
    "@xcite studied obscured variables in the lmc and showed that the @xmath8 magnitudes of obscured stars cover a wide range at a given pulsation period .",
    "for instance , their data indicates that the difference can be more than two magnitudes in the case of the carbon - rich stars .",
    "it is interesting to note that their red stars ( those with long periods and @xmath8 magnitudes fainter than @xmath1611 mag ) clearly locate the brighter part of sequence @xmath20 on the period-@xmath8 magnitude plane .",

    "although the fundamental ( group @xmath25 ) and first overtone ( group @xmath26 ) cepheids are clearly separated in the period-@xmath8 magnitude plane , we do nt see any significant difference between them in this diagram .",
    "this means , if we compare the fundamental and first overtone cepheids with the same pulsation periods , the stellar radii of first overtone cepheids should be larger than those of fundamental cepheids because their stellar temperatures are nearly the same but the first overtone cepheids are brighter than the fundamental ones .",
    "theories predict exactly the same conclusion ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and if the stellar radius of the cepheid variables could be measured accurately , it will help to identify the pulsation modes .",
    "the less regularly pulsating red giants ( group @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) also follow a tight sequence on the period-@xmath1 colour plane .",
    "the thick solid lines in the figure indicate the least - square fit of a linear relation to the stars from the four groups , whose @xmath1 colours and periods are within the ranges , 0.7 @xmath31 1.3 and 1.2 @xmath32 2.1 .",

    "it is obvious that most of the @xmath15 and @xmath33 stars in the lmc , and also some @xmath34 stars and most of @xmath15 stars in the smc do not follow the extension of these relations . in paper",
    "i , we confirmed the conclusion of @xcite and suggested that stars on sequences @xmath15 and @xmath33 are mira variables pulsating in the fundamental and first overtone mode respectively , by comparing their model calculations with our observational data .",
    "figure  [ periodcolor ] clearly shows that @xmath15 and @xmath33 stars behave very similarly on the period-@xmath1 colour plane .",
    "this corroborates the idea that the @xmath15 and @xmath33 stars are the same type of stars ( i.e. , miras ) , but only different in the pulsation modes . also , it is likely that the `` some @xmath34 stars '' in the smc are the counterparts of the @xmath33 stars in the lmc .",
    "in earlier work , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite obtained period-@xmath1 colour relations of mira variables in the lmc , sgr i baade window of the galactic bulge and solar neighborhood , respectively .",
    "these relations are all based on the saao system .",
    "the atmospheres of mira variables are rather complex , making their quantitative comparisons difficult between different filter systems .",
    "thus here we make only qualitative discussions .",
    "just to get a rough idea , we indicated in the upper panel of figure  [ periodcolor ] the period-@xmath1 colour relations obtained by @xcite for carbon- ( labeled i ) and oxygen - rich ( labeled ii ) miras and by @xcite ( labeled iii ) after referring to the lco system by assuming @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "of course we can not tell exactly which of our stars are carbon- or oxygen - rich , but it is statistically fair to say that stars with @xmath1 colours redder than 1.4 are primarily carbon - rich stars ( @xcite ) . in this point of view",
    ", we confirmed the result of @xcite that oxygen- and carbon - rich miras follow different period-@xmath1 colour relations .",
    "now that we see the @xmath15 and @xmath33 stars separate on the period-@xmath1 colour plane , it will be interesting to search for the galactic counterpart of the first overtone miras ( @xmath33 stars ) by using this tool .",
    "then we can redetermine their distances using their exclusive period-@xmath8 magnitude relation , which we obtained in paper i. it will help to understand the differences between the fundamental and first overtone miras through more detailed studies that are technically difficult in the magellanic clouds ( i.e. , spectroscopic work and mid - infrared observations etc . ) . because not only @xmath15 and @xmath33 stars but also the other variables separate on the period-@xmath1 colour plane , the same argument is true for them , such as @xmath20 stars .",
    "however , before applying this tool to different environments , we should know whether it depends on chemical abundance .",
    "@xcite showed that small amplitude red giant variables in the galactic bar can be separated into two groups , and they follow different period - colour relations . also , they suggest that their @xmath36 and @xmath37 stars correspond to type @xmath18 and @xmath19 variables , respectively of paper i. the insets of the figure  [ periodcolor ] clearly confirm their result , showing that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are well separated on the period-@xmath1 color plane .",
    "this infers that the period-@xmath1 relations we derived in equations  [ pclmc ] and [ pcsmc ] are merely the general trends of the variable red giants , and in fact there are exclusive period - colour relations for each population .",
    "@xcite studied infrared properties of long period variables in cen a. although they did not mention it , it is likely that there are two groups in their period - colour diagrams ( see their figure 10 ) .",
    "we suggest that their short - period ( @xmath38 ) and long - period ( @xmath39 ) groups could correspond to type @xmath33 and @xmath15 stars in the lmc , respectively .",
    "these facts strengthen the idea that , period - colour diagram is a good and universal tool , at least to tell the type of variable stars within a system .",
    "diagram of ogle variables in the lmc ( upper panel ) and the smc ( lower panel ) . ]",
    "@xcite studied the agaperos / denis variables in the lmc and showed that so - called semi - regular variables follow a period - colour relation but the `` regular '' variables do not ( see their figure 12 ) . to see the regularity of the light variation quantitatively",
    ", we show the relationship between the statistic parameter @xmath14 and period in figure  [ p - t ] .",
    "the figure clearly confirmed the lebzelter s suggestion and shows that stars that follow period-@xmath1 relation ( @xmath40 and @xmath41 stars with @xmath9 2.1 ) are less regularly pulsating , and those that do nt ( @xmath34 stars with @xmath42 , @xmath33 and @xmath15 stars ) are regularly pulsating .      figure  [ p - a ] is a plot to show the relationship between the pulsation period and amplitude ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the pulsation amplitude is determined from the ogle s @xmath2 band data , given as @xmath44 .",

    "the figure shows that the fundamental cepheids show larger amplitude variations than the first overtone cepheids .",
    "also , the upper envelope of cepheid amplitude goes down with increasing period .",
    "this trend contrasts markedly with that of red giants , because their pulsation amplitudes generally go up with increasing period .",
    "variables stars with @xmath8 magnitudes below the trgb ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 stars ) pulsate with very small amplitude . with a few exceptions ,",
    "most of the stars from @xmath20 group also pulsate with relatively small amplitude .",
    "the large amplitude pulsation ( @xmath45 0.9 ) seems to occur only among the long - period ( @xmath46 2.3 ) variables .",
    "if one had to separate semi - regular from mira variables based on pulsation amplitudes , the threshold would be about @xmath47 0.9 , because one can see a discernible gap around there .    )",

    "figure  [ c - a ] shows the relationship between the @xmath1 colour and pulsation amplitude ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the variable red giants show the clear trend that the amplitude gets larger with increasing colour . according to @xcite ,",
    "obscured carbon - rich agb stars have the @xmath1 colours redder than about 2.0 mag .",
    "almost all of such dusty carbon - rich stars in the magellanic clouds have large pulsation amplitudes .",
    "some of the relatively blue stars ( 0.8 @xmath48 1.2 ) on the sequence @xmath15 also show large amplitude pulsation .",
    "judging from their @xmath1 colour and being on the sequence @xmath15 , they are likely to be oxygen - rich mira variables .",
    "it is remarkable that the carbon - rich miras tend to have greater @xmath2-band amplitudes at redder @xmath1 colour , but the amplitudes of oxygen - rich miras are almost independent of the colour .",
    "this might reflect the difference in the molecular opacities at @xmath2-band between the two groups .      in a large sense , variable stars in the magellanic clouds",
    "behave similarly in the figures we discussed so far .",
    "however , on closer view , there are differences between variable stars in the two galaxies . in the colour - amplitude diagram ( figure  [ c - a ] ) , we see smaller number of oxygen - rich large amplitude mira variables in the smc ( counterpart of lmc miras with @xmath1 colours bluer than 1.4 ) compared to the lmc .",
    "this is probably because the difference in average chemical abundance and/or in age between the two galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we presented the data of 8,852 and 2,927 variable stars in the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "based on these data , we discussed the infrared properties of the variable stars .",
    "we showed that period-@xmath1 colour diagram is a good tool to tell the pulsation modes of the mira variables . a follow - up campaign searching for the galactic counterpart of the first overtone mode miras would tell us the difference between them and fundamental mode miras .",
