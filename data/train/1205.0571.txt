    "type ib / c supernovae ( sne ) are among the few astronomical objects that do not show h in their spectra .",
    "it is therefore believed that they are the explosions of stars that have shed their outer h envelope ( sne  ib ) , or even ( most of ) their he envelope ( sne  ic ) .",
    "for this reason , they are known as _ stripped _ sne . to date",
    ", there has been no direct progenitor detection of a sn  ib / c in pre - explosion images ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smartt 2009 ) ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is widely believed that stripped sne are the explosions of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars , exactly because these stars appear to be h - free .",
    "depending on their spectroscopic appearance , wr stars can be broadly divided into nitrogen - rich ( wn ) and carbon - rich ( wc ) stars .",
    "a comprehensive review of wr stars , their sub - classes , and their properties is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crowther ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "wn stars are expected to die as sne  ib , while wc stars as sne  ic , although variations to this general picture might exist , depending on the progenitor metallicity and initial mass ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* georgy et  al . 2009 ) ) .",
    "even if the connection of sne  ib / c to wr stars seems like the only plausible scenario , it is important to stress that it awaits confirmation , especially in its details .",
    "another fundamental question concerning stripped sne and their progenitors is the _ way _ that they lose their h envelopes .",
    "massive stars lose mass through stellar winds and this is one of the main theoretical channels leading to a sn  ib / c . for single stars to reach the wr phase",
    "it is estimated that they need to start their lives with an initial mass @xmath0  25  m@xmath1 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crowther 2007 ) ) .",
    "another way for a star to lose its h envelope , is through evolution in a binary system ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* podsiadlowski et  al . 1992 ) ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the outer layers of the primary star are expelled through interaction with its binary companion ( roche - lobe overflow or common envelope evolution ) .",
    "it is important to note that through the binary channel , it is possible to obtain stripped stars from initial masses substantially lower than from the single progenitor channel .",
    "direct searches for sn progenitors have not yielded any results yet and , even in the best case , are not expected to give more than a handful of detections during the next decade .",
    "studies of the sn properties themselves ( light - curves , spectra , etc ) are informative , but they suffer from small numbers and the difficulty of acquiring suitable homogeneous datasets .",
    "another powerful means of probing the nature of these explosions is by studying their environments .",
    "although indirect , ` environmental ' methods have statistical power ( as large samples can be constructed ) and can be used in complementary manner to direct methods in order to attack the same problem from different angles . here , we concentrate on some of these methods as they have been applied to stripped sne : in section  [ sec : wr ] we compare the locations of sne  ib / c ( and long grbs ) within their host galaxy with those of wr stars , while in section  [ sec : spec ] we describe direct spectroscopic observations of the birthplaces of sne  ib / c , with the purpose of studying their metallicity and stellar population ages .",
    "the main driver motivating this comparison is the following : _ if wr stars are the progenitors of stripped sne and long grbs , they must also be found in similar locations within their hosts_. the distribution of long grbs with respect to their host galaxy light was studied by ( * ? ? ? * fruchter et  al . ( 2006 ) ) , while those of different sn sub - types by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kelly et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) .",
    "the statistical diagnostic used is the _ fractional flux _ , which describes the fraction of light in host locations fainter than the explosion locations , over the integrated galaxy light .",
    "simply put , a fractional flux value of 0 means that the explosion took place in a location without flux , while a value of 1 means that the explosion took place in the brightest location of the host .",
    "a similar statistic was used by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* anderson & james ( 2008 ) ) , while other authors ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* larsson et  al . 2007 ) ) have used this notion in theoretical studies .",
    "* fruchter et  al . ( 2006 ) ) showed that grbs showed a strong preference for occurring in the brightest locations of their host .",
    "* kelly et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) , studying a more nearby sample of sn hosts drawn from sdss , showed that sne  ii , ib , and ic occur in progressively brighter locations , with the distribution of sne  ic being broadly consistent with the one of grbs .    in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* leloudas et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) , hereafter l10 , we extended this analysis to compare with the locations of wr stars within their host galaxies .",
    "for this purpose , we used the work of crowther and collaborators , who in the recent years have mapped the population of wr stars in a number of nearby galaxies .",
    "what makes these papers very attractive for this kind of study is that a detailed estimate of the _ completion level _ of the surveys is given .",
    "we have excluded from our study many galaxies whose information on the wr population is known , but suffer from some kind of incompleteness . at the time of publication of l10 , this analysis was possible for two galaxies : m  83 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hadfield et  al . 2005 ) ) and ngc  1313 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hadfield & crowther 2007 ) ) .",
    "at present , suitable data are available for two more galaxies : ngc  7793 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bibby & crowther 2010 ) ) and ngc  5068 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bibby & crowther 2012 ) ) . in this proceeding",
    ", we extend our analysis to include these new data .",
    "it should thus be regarded as a continuation and complementary to the original paper ( l10 ) .",
    "a conceptual difference between our approach and the one of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* fruchter et  al .",
    "( 2006 ) ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kelly et  al .",
    "( 2008 ) ) , is that these studies examine many host galaxies with one explosion per galaxy , while we only examine a few galaxies with many potential explosion progenitors .",
    "it is therefore important to take into account the general properties of these individual galaxies during the comparison , to make sure that they are not radically different .",
    "metallicity is a particularly important factor , as both the total number of wr stars and the ratio of wc to wn stars strongly depend on it . in l10",
    ", we showed that m  83 ( a galaxy with super - solar metallicity ) is a very typical representative of the sn  ib / c host sample , while ngc  1313 is both fainter and more metal poor .",
    "the two new galaxies have somewhat intermediate properties between these two .",
    "as discussed by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bibby & crowther ( 2010 , 2012 ) ) , they both demonstrate important metallicity gradients encompassing both solar and lmc values .",
    "another important difference is that these galaxies are more nearby . to enable the comparison , it is necessary to resample them and make them appear as if they were at the median redshift of the sn host sample ( l10 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] contains a comparison of the wn and the wc distributions of these 4 galaxies ( panels a and b ) .",
    "the wn distributions are not identical : in the case of ngc  1313 , it almost follows the host galaxy light , while the others move progressively toward brighter locations . as a matter of fact , this appears to be happening as a function of host metallicity . at this stage , we just point this out as an interesting finding , although it might disappear with a larger sample , and it is not straightforward to explain .",
    "our favorite explanation is that at the low metal content of ngc  1313 , it is more difficult for wr stars to lose all their h , and that wn stars might retain enough h to appear spectroscopically as a sn  ii ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* georgy et  al . 2009 ) ) . in the case of the wc distributions , the one that stands out",
    "is ngc  5068 .",
    "this is the only galaxy in this sample , for which the wc distribution is not skewed to brighter pixels than the wn , as also pointed out by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bibby & crowther ( 2012 ) ) .",
    "one of the main conclusions of l10 was that wc stars are found on average in brighter locations ( and therefore closer to star - forming regions ) of their hosts than wn stars .",
    "this statement is therefore now true for 3 out of 4 galaxies",
    ". it will be interesting to see how this will evolve in the future with a larger sample .",
    "it is possible to combine the distributions from the different galaxies , although this approach has weaknesses because all distributions have particularities ( both physical and related to the observation methods ) . especially m  83 stands out from the rest of the sample : ( i ) it has a super - solar metallicity that is very different from the average metallicities of the other 3 galaxies ( that ignoring metallicity gradients are not that different ) ; ( ii ) it has a wr population far greater than all the others added together ( and therefore any combined sample would be heavily weighted towards m  83 ) . for this reason",
    ", it was decided to only combine the distributions from the other 3 galaxies .",
    "these are presented in panel c of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , while m  83 is shown separately in panel d. in addition , for m  83 , comparisons are made after the removal of the bulge light ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* kelly et  al . 2008 ) ) , since the wr survey is incomplete in this region of the galaxy ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hadfield et  al . 2005 ) ) .",
    "the results for m  83 were discussed in l10 .",
    "briefly , wc stars are found ( on average ) in brighter locations than wn stars and both distributions are statistically compatible with sne  ib / c .",
    "they are incompatible with sne  ii , while wc stars are marginally compatible with grbs . in the combined sample , which now contains over 100 wn and wc stars including the most secure photometric candidates , we observe again that the average wc distribution appears in brighter pixels than the average wn distribution . a ks test between the two yields @xmath2% .",
    "the wn distribution is highly compatible with sne  ib ( @xmath3% ) while it is highly incompatible with sne  ii , sne  ic and grbs ( p - values of 0.1% , 0.7% and 0% respectively ) .",
    "the wc distribution is again mostly compatible with sne  ib ( @xmath4% ) , but also with sne  ic ( @xmath5% ) .",
    "it is marginally compatible with grbs ( @xmath6% ) , while the association with sne  ii is excluded ( @xmath7% ) .",
    "we believe that these results are in nice agreement with the theoretical expectations and with the idea that wc stars originate from more massive progenitors than wn stars .",
    "wn stars sometimes evolve to become wc stars , depending on the initial mass and metallicity . in a monte carlo simulation we allowed a fraction of wn stars to be included to the wc fractional flux distribution . for the combined sample",
    ", we estimate that this fraction is of the order of 20% ( see l10 for details ) .",
    "the simulation showed that this effect does not alter our general conclusions , although the specific p - values change .",
    "similar simulations were executed by l10 for m  83 as well as for the effect of photometric candidates and the wr number errors .",
    "there are a number of predictions that are related to the single progenitor scenario , and that could be used to test it .",
    "first , mass stripping must be the result of stellar winds .",
    "stellar winds are driven by metals and their strength increases with metallicity ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vink & de koter 2005 ) ) .",
    "it is therefore anticipated that sne  ic will be found , on average , in more metal - rich environments than sne  ib , if they result from massive stars .",
    "second , massive stars have short lifetimes . therefore ,",
    "if sne  ib / c come from single massive stars , they must be found close to areas of recent star formation .    .",
    "the role of metallicity at the locations of sne , has been examined by many authors . until recently",
    ", however , most studies were either restricted to special events ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sollerman et  al . 2005 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* modjaz et  al . 2008 ) ) , or were based on abundances measured at the host galaxy nucleus ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* prieto et  al .",

    "these numbers are given in the n2 scale of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) ) and include the systematic uncertainty related to the calibration of this relation .",
    "the contamination from stellar continuum was removed by fitting ( * ? ? ?",
    "* bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) ) models , but this procedure did not significantly affect our results . we conclude that there might be hints that sne  ic are found in more metal - rich environments than sne  ib , but this difference is far from being statistically significant . a ks test between the two distributions gives the non - decisive p - value of 17% .",
    "the other two studies did not yield consistent results : ( * ? ? ?",

    "* anderson et  al .",
    "( 2010 ) ) and similar to the one of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* modjaz et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) ) , comprises sne in both targeted and non - targeted surveys ( in almost equal ratios ) and there is evidence that the latter are found in lower metallicity than the former ( ( * ? ? ? * leloudas et  al . 2011 ) ) .    even in the last two studies",
    ", however , it is true that this bias is not properly quantified .",
    "in addition , the difference between sne  ib and ic , if it exists , appears to be small and comparable to the systematic errors affecting the metallicity calibrators .",
    "for this reason , if a significant difference is to be sought , a large and well - controlled sample will be needed ( see also talk by m.  modjaz ; this volume ) . in any case",

    "* leitherer et  al .",

    "* leloudas et  al . 2011 ) ) , to constrain the ages of the local stellar populations in the vicinity of the sn explosions .",
    "it is not important for our purposes that this method is only sensitive to the youngest , ionizing , stellar populations probed by our slit , exactly because what we want is to place a _",
