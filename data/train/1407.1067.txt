    "these divergences have various desirable mathematical properties ; they are strictly positive , non - increasing under stochastic maps , and jointly convex for @xmath5 and jointly quasi - convex for @xmath6 . for fixed @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath9 is a monotone increasing function of @xmath0 , and the limit @xmath10 yields the relative entropy ( a.k.a .",
    "kullback - leibler divergence ) , probably the single most important quantity in information theory .",
    "even more importantly , the rnyi divergences have great operational significance , as quantifiers of the trade - off between the relevant operational quantities in many information theoretic tasks , including hypothesis testing , source compression , and information transmission through noisy channels @xcite . a direct operational interpretation of the rnyi divergences as",
    "generalized cutoff rates has been shown in @xcite .    in the view of the above ,",
    "it is natural to look for an extension of the rnyi divergences for pairs of quantum states .",
    "one such extension has been known in quantum information theory for quite some time , defined for states @xmath11 and @xmath12 as @xcite @xmath13 these divergences also form a monotone increasing family , with the umegaki relative entropy @xmath14 as their limit at @xmath10 .",
    "they are also strictly positive ; however , monotonicity under stochastic ( i.e. , completely positive and trace - preserving ) maps only holds for @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "recently , a new quantum rnyi divergence has been introduced in @xcite , defined as @xmath16 again , these new divergences yield the umegaki relative entropy in the limit @xmath10 , and monotonicity only holds on a restricted domain , in this case for @xmath17 .    operational interpretation has been found for both definitions in the setting of binary hypothesis testing for different and matching domains of @xmath0 .",
    "the goal in hypothesis testing is to decide between two candidates , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , for the true state of a quantum system , based on a measurement on many identical copies of the system .",
    "the quantum stein s lemma @xcite states that it is possible to make the probability of erroneously choosing @xmath11 ( type ii error ) to vanish exponentially fast in the number of copies , with the exponent being the relative entropy @xmath18 , while the probability of erroneously choosing @xmath12 ( type i error ) goes to zero asymptotically .",
    "if the type ii error is required to vanish with a suboptimal exponent @xmath19 ( this is called the direct domain ) then the type i error can also be made to vanish exponentially fast , with the optimal exponent being the hoeffding divergence @xmath20 $ ] @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath21 with @xmath5 quantify the trade - off between the rates of the type i and the type ii error probabilities in the direct domain .",
    "based on this trade - off relation , a more direct operational interpretation was obtained in @xcite as generalized cutoff rates in the sense of csiszr @xcite . on the other hand , if the type ii error is required to vanish with an exponent @xmath22 ( this is called the strong converse domain ) then the type i error goes to @xmath23 exponentially fast , with the optimal exponent being the converse hoeffding divergence @xmath24 $ ] @xcite .",
    "thus , the @xmath25 with @xmath6 quantify the trade - off between the rates of the type i success probability and the type ii error probability in the strong converse region . based on this ,",
    "a direct operational interpretation of the @xmath25 as generalized cutoff rates was also given in @xcite for @xmath6 .",
    "in the view of the above results , it seems that the old and the new definitions provide the operationally relevant quantum extension of rnyi s divergences in different domains : for @xmath5 , the operationally relevant definition seems to be the old one , corresponding to the direct domain of hypothesis testing , whereas for @xmath6 , the operationally relevant definition seems to be the new one , corresponding to the strong converse domain of hypothesis testing .",
    "this is the picture at least when one wants to describe the full trade - off curve ; most of the time , however , one is interested in one single point of this curve , corresponding to @xmath26 , where the transition from exponentially vanishing error probability to exponentially vanishing success probability happens .",
    "it is known that using the `` wrong '' divergence can be beneficial to obtaining coding theorems at this point .",
    "indeed , the strong converse property for hypothesis testing and classical - quantum channel coding has been proved using @xmath21 for @xmath6 in @xcite ( `` wrong '' divergence with the `` right '' values of @xmath0 ) , while a proof for the direct part of these problems was obtained recently in @xcite , using @xmath27 (  ` wrong' divergence with a `` wrong '' value of @xmath0 ) .",
    "further examples of coding theorems based on the `` wrong '' rnyi divergence were given in @xcite , where it was shown that a certain concavity property of the new rnyi divergences , which the old ones do nt have , make them a very convenient tool to prove the direct part of various coding theorems in composite / compound settings .",
    "this was demonstrated by giving short and simple proofs for the direct part of stein s lemma with composite null - hypothesis and for classical - quantum channel coding with compound channels .",
    "although the optimal rates for these problems have already been known @xcite , the proofs in @xcite are different from the previous ones , and offer considerable simplifications .",
    "the general approach is the following :    1 .",
    "we start with a single - shot coding theorem that gives a trade - off relation between the relevant quantities of the problem in terms of rnyi divergences . for stein",
    "s lemma , this is audenaert s trace inequality @xcite , while for channel coding we use the hayashi - nagaoka random coding theorem from @xcite .",
    "we then use general properties of the rnyi divergences to decouple the upper bounds from multiple to a single null - hypothesis / channel and to derive the asymptotics .",
    "the main advantage of this approach is that the second step only relies on universal properties of the rnyi divergences and is largely independent of the concrete problem at hand . in particular ,",
    "the coding theorems for the composite / compound settings can be obtained with the same amount of effort as for a simple null - hypothesis / single channel .    in this paper",
    "we present a variant for the proof of stein s lemma with composite null - hypothesis . while in @xcite exponential bounds on the error probabilities",
    "were given , here we study the asymptotics of the optimal type ii error probability for a given threshold @xmath28 on the type i error probability .",
    "building on results from @xcite and @xcite , we derive finite - size bounds on the deviation of the optimal type ii error from its asymptotic value .",
    "such bounds are of practical importance , since in real - life scenarios one always works with finitely many copies .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec : not ] is a summary of notations . in section [ sec : renyi ]",
    "we review some properties of the quantum rnyi divergences , including two inequalities from @xcite : lemma [ lemma : old - new bounds ] , which gives quantitative bounds between the old and the new definitions of the quantum rnyi divergences , and corollary [ cor : new renyi superadd ] , which shows that the convexity of the new rnyi divergence in its first argument can be complemented in the form of a weak quasi - concavity inquality . for readers convenience ,",
