    "graphene is a new material experimentally discovered about three years ago @xcite .",
    "this is a monolayer of carbon atoms packed in a dense two - dimensional ( 2d ) honeycomb lattice , figure [ latt ] , left panel .",
    "the spectrum of electrons in graphene e_*k*l=(-1)^l |e^i*k**b*_1 + e^i*k**b*_2 + e^i*k**b*_3|/3 ,  l=1,2 , [ sp ] can be calculated in the tight - binding approximation taking into account the symmetry of the lattice ( here @xmath0 is the electron wavevector ; the vectors @xmath1 are defined in the caption of figure [ latt ] ) .",
    "it consists of two bands ( @xmath2 and 2 ) which touch each other at the six corners of the hexagon shaped brillouin zone , figure [ latt ] , right panel . in uniform and undoped",
    "graphene at zero temperature , the lower band @xmath3 is fully occupied while the upper band @xmath4 is empty , and the fermi level goes through these six , so called dirac points @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "near the dirac points the electron dispersion is linear , e_*k*l=(-1)^l v|*k*| ,  = * k*- * q*_i ,  ||a1 ,  v10 ^ 6  m / s,[spectrum ] and the behavior of electrons can be described by the dirac equation with the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 are pauli matrices ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "only two of the six dirac cones are physically inequivalent which is accounted for by the valley degeneracy factor @xmath10 .",
    "the linear ( massless ) dispersion of graphene electrons near the fermi level leads to a number of interesting linear and non - linear electrodynamic phenomena , which are briefly discussed in this paper .",
    "some of these effects are very promising for microwave and terahertz applications of graphene .",
    "using the standard self - consistent linear - response theory and starting from the dirac hamiltonian @xmath11 one can calculate the frequency dependent conductivity of graphene @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it consists of two contributions .",
    "the _ intra_-band conductivity _ intra ( ) = ( e^/2t+e^-/2 t ) [ sigma - intra ] has the drude form and is similar to the conductivity of conventional 2d electron systems .",
    "inter_-band conductivity has the form _",
    "inter()&= & -_0^ dx , [ sigma - inter ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the temperature , the chemical potential and the momentum scattering rate respectively , and @xmath16 is the spin degeneracy .",
    "figure [ cond]a shows the total graphene conductivity @xmath17 as a function of @xmath18 at several typical values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . at high frequencies , @xmath21 , @xmath17 tends to a universal value @xmath22 dependent only on the fundamental physical constants .",
    "the behaviour of @xmath17 shown in figure [ cond]a has been experimentally confirmed in ref .",
    "@xcite .      the experimentally measurable transmission @xmath23 , reflection @xmath24 and absorption @xmath25 spectra are determined by the conductivity @xmath17 , since the transmission amplitude @xmath26 is @xmath27^{-1}$ ] . at high frequencies the transmission and absorption coefficients",
    "are universal , t=1-a=(1+/2)^-21- ,  \\{t,},[transm ] where @xmath28 .",
    "figure [ cond]b illustrates the @xmath29 dependence @xcite .",
    "the universal transmission ( [ transm ] ) has been observed in @xcite .",
    "the plasma waves in graphene have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite . in the long - wavelength limit @xmath30",
    "the 2d plasmons in graphene have a square - root dispersion ( @xmath31 is the fermi wave - vector ) ^2_p = g_sg_ve^2q/2 ^ 2q.[2dp ] the density ( @xmath32 ) dependence of the 2d plasmon frequency in graphene @xmath33 differs from that of the conventional 2d plasmons ( @xmath34 ) . at larger wavevectors ( @xmath35 , but",
    "still @xmath36 ) the 2d plasmons acquire an additional damping due to the inter - band absorption @xcite .    at even larger wavevectors @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) the 2d plasmon spectrum should be calculated taking into account the full energy spectrum of graphene electrons ( [ sp ] ) and the local field effects @xcite .",
    "such calculations @xcite reveal a new type of low - frequency plasmons ",
    "the _ inter - valley plasmons _  with the linear dispersion @xmath39 , where @xmath6 and @xmath40 .",
    "the 2d plasmons ( [ 2dp ] ) are the transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes .",
    "the transverse electric ( te ) electromagnetic modes do not exist in conventional 2d electron systems .",
    "it was shown however @xcite that in graphene the te modes should exist at @xmath41 , where the imaginary part of the dynamical conductivity @xmath42 is negative , figure [ cond]b .",
    "if a particle with the linear dispersion ( [ spectrum ] ) is placed in the external electric field @xmath43 , its momentum @xmath44 will be proportional to @xmath45 and the velocity @xmath46  to @xmath47 .",
    "as the function ( t)=4(t + 133t+155t+  ) [ sgnsin ] contains all odd fourier harmonics , irradiation of graphene by a wave with the frequency @xmath48 should lead ( in contrast to the conventional electron systems ) to the emission at higher harmonics at frequencies @xmath49 with @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "a more accurate theory @xcite takes into account the distribution of electrons over quantum states in the energy bands and the self - consistent field effects .",
    "if @xmath51 , the higher harmonics generation depends on two parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the ( linear - response ) radiative decay rate @xcite ( here @xmath28 ) .",
    "our calculations show ( figure [ mult ] ) that the system efficiently generates higher harmonics if @xmath55 , i.e. at e_0=c300n_s(10 ^ 11/cm^2).[estim33 ] the estimate ( [ estim33 ] ) does not depend on the frequency of radiation ( it is assumed however that the dimensions of the sample exceed the wavelength of radiation and that @xmath56 ) .      electromagnetic response of graphene to a strong pulse excitation @xmath57 also differs from that of conventional 2d electron systems ( here @xmath58 and @xmath59 are the amplitude and the duration of the pulse ) . the momentum relaxation in graphene after the strong pulse excitation is _ linear _ in time @xcite , in contrast to the exponential relaxation in conventional systems .",
    "the characteristic response time in the non - linear regime is @xmath60 .      to describe the influence of a magnetic field @xmath61 on the non - linear electromagnetic response of graphene we solve",
    "the system of quasi - classical non - linear equations of motion for @xmath62 dirac quasi - particles = ib - e- ,  j=1n _ k=1^n.[bf ] here @xmath63 is the complex momentum of the @xmath64-th particle , normalized to the fermi momentum @xmath65 , @xmath66 is the current , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the term @xmath69 in ( [ bf ] ) results from the self - consistent - field effects and describes the radiative decay .",
    "figure [ bfield]a shows the time dependence of the ac electric current in the regime of the strong ac electric @xmath70 and weak magnetic fields @xmath71 . apart from the current @xmath72 with the time dependence close to ( [ sgnsin ] ) the system generates the hall current @xmath73 with the higher frequency harmonics . in the regime of weak electric fields @xmath74 the frequency transformation effects",
    "become even more complicated , figure [ bfield]b . the regular particle dynamics becomes chaotic and the system generates both lower and a lot of higher harmonics .",
    "this is a consequence of the singular motion of graphene electrons in the vicinity of the dirac point where the cyclotron frequency @xmath75 of individual particles diverges at @xmath76 .",
    "the transition to the chaotic dynamics should be observed at @xmath77 .",
    "due to the linear energy dispersion ( [ spectrum ] ) , graphene is a strongly non - linear material from the viewpoint of its electrodynamic properties .",
    "the frequency multiplication effect falls down very slowly with the harmonics index @xmath78 and should be seen in moderate electric fields . in weak magnetic fields it should be possible to observe the transition from the regular to chaotic particle dynamics dependent on the amplitudes of the @xmath79 and @xmath80 fields .",
    "the predicted non - linear electrodynamic phenomena open up new interesting opportunities for studying the fundamental physics of dirac quasi - particles as well as for building innovative devices for microwave and terahertz optoelectronics .",
