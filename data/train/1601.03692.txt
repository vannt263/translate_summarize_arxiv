    "recent years has seen a tremendous progress in the ability to study the physics of atoms trapped in confined optical lattices .",
    "a significant development has been the tuning of the interactions ( scattering lengths ) between the particles via feshbach resonances.@xcite a further important achievement is the ability to confine just a few atoms in a potential well or trap.@xcite the situation of a few particles confined in this fashion is also encountered in other areas of physics",
    ". one old problem in nuclear physics is for example that of two or more nucleons outside a closed shell .",
    "the recent experimental research in atomic physics that enables a control of interacions as well as the environment represented by the trap has stimulated theoretical studies of this basic quantum - mechanical problem : two or more particles interacting while trapped in some specified potential well .    in this paper the investigation is restricted to two particles in either a 3-dimensional h.o .",
    "trap or in a spherical square - well trap . of particular interest in a study of this kind",
    "is of course the two - body interaction between the particles .",
    "it can be represented by some potential model e.g. psudo - potential @xcite or chiral effective field theory potential@xcite .",
    "it is however found that the interactions , under specific asumptions , can be related to scattering data and this is the route taken in this report .",
    "an expression first derived by busch et al @xcite relates the _ energy - spectrum of two point - like particles , interacting in a 3-d harmonic oscillator ( h.o . ) well , to scattering phase - shifts .",
    "the derived formula is restricted to point - like particles , meaning that the range of the interaction has to be short compared to the size of the trap and is then the solution of an exactly solvable model .",
    "the pointlike interaction implies that the relative angular momentum @xmath8 . the formula has been extended to @xmath9 assuming that the range of the interaction is still small .",
    "@xcite _    in the present work , restricted to @xmath8 , the expression for the two - particle energy spectrum as derived in ref .",
    "@xcite is used to find the _ shifts in energy - levels from the non - interacting to the interacting spectrum .",
    "it is shown that these shifts converge to the phase - shift approximation for large h.o .",
    "quantum - numbers @xmath1 and for small as well as large scattering lengths .",
    "calculations , shown in sect .",
    "2 , moreover show that the phase - shift approximation and the exact result for the two - body spectrum obtained by busch et al . give practically indistinguishable results . _    the good agreemnet with the phase - shift approximation for the two - body spectrum may be unique to the h.o . trap .    for comparison , in the similar case of two particles interacting in a spherical square well the calculations presented in sect .",
    "3 shows that the phase - shift approximation is viable only in the limit of small ( in units of box - radius ) scattering lengths and large @xmath1-values and it is in general a much worse an approximation than it is for the h.o .      if the trap is a spherical square - well ( or box ) the shift in energy spectrum due to the two particle s mutual interaction can , as shown below in sect .",
    "3 , easily be obtained without reference to a potential model.@xcite in the limit of a large size of the box this shift is @xmath10 , the scattering phase - shift at momentum @xmath11 .",
    "( only angular momentum @xmath8 is considered here although most results are also valid for all values of @xmath12 . )",
    "a more elaborate but instructive method of obtaining the energy - shift was used in early attempts of developping a many - body theory of nuclei .",
    "brueckner initially assumed the in - medium ( effective ) two - body interaction to be @xmath13 .",
    "@xcite the initial problem studied was that of an infinite system of nuclear matter for the purpose of calculating binding energy and saturation properties of this system .",
    "the @xmath14 approximation came from the assumption that the reactance matrix @xcite , could be used as an approximation for the in - medium interaction in the many - body problem .",
    "( the diagonal part of this matrix is @xmath13 ) .",
    "the definition of the reactance matrix involves a principal value integration over a _ continuous spectrum .",
    "it was assumed that the numerical summation over the closely spaced level - spectrum of nucleons in a very large ( infinite ) box would give an equivalent result .",
    "this assumption was substantiated by reifman and dewitt@xcite .",
    "it was however soon realized to be incorrect .",
    "several authors ( one of them dewitt ) showed that the correct limit for two particles in a big box would yield an in - medium interaction @xmath10 rather than @xmath14 . @xcite and at low density this might not make any difference but with @xmath15 ( large scattering length ) , a situation often discussed in recent works , it obviously does . ]",
    "_    the reactance matrix is part of scattering theory .",
    "the nuclear matter problem assumes a box , although large but still finite with boundary conditions different from that of scattering theory .",
    "the proofs in the papers refered to above differ , but the essential point is that the integration over the continuous spectrum vs the summation over the discrete spectrum of particles in a box differ , even though the level - spacing in a big box goes towards zero as the box - size increases .",
    "the principal value integration relates to the scattering problem with boundary conditions different from that for a box where the wave - functions are zero at the edge of the box even in the limit of the box being infinitely large .",
    "the exact statement of the results in the referenced papers is that the energy - shift @xmath16 due to the interaction of two - particles confined in a spherical box in the limit when the size of the box approaches infinity is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the spacing between the levels of the unperturbed spectrum and @xmath19    this energy shift implies that the _ diagonal part of the effective interaction in a big box is given by @xmath20 _    in nuclear matter studies ( implying an infinite box ) this has been referred to as the phase - shift approximation a term adopted here .",
    "it was for example used in early calculations on the neutron - gas@xcite .",
    "many - body calculations do in general also require _ off - diagonal elements of the interaction , as in the calculation of the brueckner reaction - matrix . in some early nuclear matter studies ,",
