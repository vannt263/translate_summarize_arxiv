    "as a consequence of einstein s theory of relativity , it is predicted that the violent nonradial pulsations excited immediately after the birth of a rotating proto - neutron star result in the emission of significant amounts of gravitational radiation .",
    "in addition , it has been discovered by chandrasekhar @xcite and friedman & schutz @xcite that certain pulsation modes of rotating relativistic stars may grow exponentially due to gravitational radiation backreaction , especially if the proto - neutron star is rapidly rotating ; this is the so - called cfs instability .",
    "the exact amount of energy emitted by the stable oscillations of neutron stars in the form of gravitational waves is actually unknown and depends uniquely on the initial conditions .",
    "the stable stellar pulsations will emit gravitational waves which are detectable only if the neutron star is in our galaxy or in the most optimal case in the nearby ones @xcite .",
    "thus , the cases in which these oscillations become unstable are of special interest for gravitational wave astronomy , since the corresponding gravitational waves will be detectable even for sources in the nearby galactic clusters .",
    "it has been suggested that the detection of gravitational waves from pulsating neutron stars will allow the study of their interior , see @xcite .",
    "it is expected that the identification of specific pulsation frequencies in the observational data will reveal the properties of matter at densities that currently can not be probed by any other experiment .",
    "the study of the dynamics of fast rotating neutron stars in a general relativistic framework was practically impossible until recently .",
    "the main reason why linear theory failed is the form and the size of the relevant perturbation equations .",
    "thus , it is not surprising that the first results for the oscillations of fast rotating stars were derived by using evolutions of the nonlinear equations , see @xcite .",
    "still most of these studies were purely axisymmetric and thus there was a significant influence of rotation on the oscillation spectra only for very high rotation rates .",
    "the cfs instability on the other hand is active only for nonaxisymmetric perturbations . in the last two years",
    "there was a significant progress in the study of nonaxisymmetric perturbations , for the first time in a general relativistic framework , using both perturbation theory @xcite and nonlinear evolutions of coupled hydrodynamic and einstein equations @xcite .",
    "for the case of @xmath3  modes , the cfs instability is active for any rotation rate @xcite . in practice",
    "the unstable @xmath3 modes will be excited even for slowly rotating stars if they are hot enough ( @xmath4 ) , so that the instability growth time is shorter than the shear viscosity damping time .",
    "initially it was considered as a prime source for gravitational waves , but later more detailed studies on the effect of the magnetic field on the instability @xcite , or the presence of hyperons in the core @xcite , seriously questioned the potential of the instability .",
    "detailed studies suggested that the @xmath3  mode is limited to very small amplitudes due to energy transfer to a large number of other inertial modes , in the form of a cascade , leading to an equilibrium distribution of mode amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the small saturation values for the amplitude are supported by recent nonlinear estimations @xcite based on the drift , induced by the @xmath3  modes , causing differential rotation . on the other hand ,",
    "hydrodynamical simulations of limited resolution showed that an @xmath3  mode of large initial amplitude does not decay appreciably over several dynamical timescales @xcite , but on a longer timescale a catastrophic decay occurs @xcite ; this indicates a transfer of energy to other modes due to nonlinear mode couplings , and suggests that a hydrodynamical instability may be operating .",
    "a specific resonant 3-mode coupling was identified in @xcite as the cause of the instability and a perturbative analysis of the decay rate suggests a maximum dimensionless saturation amplitude @xmath5 .",
    "a new computation using second - order perturbation theory finds that the catastrophic decay seen in the hydrodynamical simulations @xcite can indeed be explained by a parametric instability operating in 3-mode couplings between the @xmath3  mode and two other inertial modes @xcite .",
    "the cfs instability of the @xmath1  modes ( nonradial modes with no radial nodes , restored by pressure ) can potentially be the strongest source for gravitational waves from isolated neutron stars .",
    "although it was the first to be studied , already 30-years ago , it was forgotten because at that time it was nearly impossible to study rapidly rotating neutron stars in a general relativistic framework .",
    "studies using newtonian theory came to the disappointing conclusion that ( in newtonian theory ) the @xmath0 @xmath1  mode is stable for rotation rates below the kepler limit .",
    "the @xmath6 @xmath1  mode does become unstable , but the growth time is so long that viscosity severely limits the amplitudes , rendering the process unimportant for gravitational wave astronomy . only in the late 90s ,",
    "stergioulas & friedman @xcite showed that for certain eos the @xmath0 @xmath1  mode can become unstable in full gr ( general relativity ) .",
    "still , this study was left aside since no proper linear or nonlinear codes were available to deal with the perturbations of rapidly rotating neutron stars in gr .",
    "if such an instability sets in , the star will emit copious amounts of gravitational radiation .",
    "first studies suggest that the signal may be detectable from distances as far as @xmath7 for the current sensitivity of virgo & ligo , and from distances greater than @xmath8 for the sensitivities of advanced virgo & ligos @xcite . in the latter case the event rate of supernovas resulting in the creation of a proto - neutron star",
    "can be quite high , i.e. more than thousand per year .",
    "however , it should be noted that it is not clear what will be the initial rotation period of the collapsing core ; it seems to depend strongly on the profile of the angular momentum distribution , the initial mass and angular momentum of the collapsing star , and also the strength of the magnetic field , which can slow down the newly born compact object quite efficiently .",
    "the hope is that still a number of supernova events , maybe 10% , will produce rapidly rotating cores which can be subject to the cfs instability of the @xmath1  modes . in any case , the next generation of gravitational wave detectors , such as einstein telescope ( et ) @xcite will be ideal for the detection of this type of instability @xcite .",
    "the two most recent hydrodynamical simulations @xcite ( in the newtonian limit and using an artificially increased post - newtonian radiation - reaction potential ) essentially confirm this picture . in @xcite",
    "a differentially rotating , @xmath9 polytropic model with a large @xmath10 was chosen as the initial equilibrium state ( @xmath11 is the rotational kinetic energy and @xmath12 the gravitational binding energy ) .",
    "the main difference of this simulation compared to the ellipsoidal approximation @xcite lies in the choice of the eos . for @xmath9 newtonian polytropes it was argued that the secular evolution can not lead to a stationary dedekind - like state .",
    "instead , the @xmath1-mode instability will continue to be active until all nonaxisymmetries are radiated away and an axisymmetric shape is reached . in another recent simulation @xcite",
    ", the initial state was chosen to be a uniformly rotating , @xmath13 polytropic model with @xmath14 .",
    "again , the main conclusions reached in @xcite were confirmed , however the assumption of uniform initial rotation limits the available angular momentum that can be radiated away , leading to a detectable signal only out to about @xmath15 .",
    "the star appears to be driven towards a dedekind - like state , but after about 10 dynamical periods , the shape is disrupted by growing short - wavelength motions , which are explained by a shearing type instability such as the elliptic flow instability @xcite .",
    "the recent progress @xcite , demonstrates that the problem can be handled properly , which should allow to answer the following questions : first , has the unstable mode any chance to be excited ?",
    "second , what is the instability window of the mode ?",
    "third , what are the exact rotation rates at the onset of the instability for the various eos ? and finally , what is the maximum amplitude that the mode may reach before saturated by nonlinear phenomena , e.g. mode coupling , mass loss , or shock formation ? in this work we try to answer the last question . in particular , we investigate nonlinear effects active at oscillation amplitudes sufficiently large to allow a detection of sources at distances greater than @xmath16 . since our methods are not restricted to a certain mode , we map out nonlinear effects occurring for axisymmetric modes as well .",
    "the latter also serves as a numerically less expensive test case to calibrate our code .",
    "the question about the saturation amplitude of the @xmath1-mode instability is a major one that has to be answered since it may completely eliminate the importance of this instability . in this article",
    "we present a systematic study of nonlinear damping effects for different amplitudes , rotation rates , and equations of state . for this",
    ", we use a nonlinear general relativistic evolution code named pizza  @xcite . up to now",
    "it has been successfully tested on small amplitude stable oscillations of rapidly rotating neutron stars and self - gravitating tori .",
    "after a number of improvements the code is well suited to follow even large amplitude oscillations of rotating stars , such as those excited during the saturation phase of the @xmath1-mode instability .",
    "a similar study has been performed for the @xmath3-mode instability in @xcite , where an artificially excited @xmath3  mode was left to evolve .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath3  mode seemed initially to decrease slowly but then it decayed catastrophically .",
    "the decay time was found to be amplitude dependent and the effect attributed to three mode coupling .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows .",
    "first we describe the numerical methods in sec .",
    "[ sec_meth ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec_models ] , we introduce the stellar models and physical problems we studied .",
    "the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec_results ] .",
    "the main results on the damping and detectability of the cfs - unstable @xmath1  mode can be found in sec .",
    "[ sec_damp_m2 ] and [ sec_detect ] , and a summary is given in sec .",
    "[ sec_summary ] .    throughout the paper we use geometrical units @xmath17 .",
    "greek indices run from @xmath18 , latin indices from @xmath19 .",
    "we denote the lowest order quasi radial mode by @xmath20 , the axisymmetric fundamental pressure modes ( @xmath1  modes ) by @xmath21 , and nonaxisymmetric ones by @xmath22 , where @xmath23 refers to the counter - rotating modes .",
    "for our simulations , we use the pizza  code described in @xcite .",
    "it evolves the general relativistic nonlinear hydrodynamic evolution equations for an ideal fluid without magnetic fields , while keeping the spacetime metric fixed ( cowling approximation ) .",
    "the hydrodynamic equations in covariant form are @xmath24 the stress energy tensor @xmath25 of an ideal fluid is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are the rest mass density , relativistic specific enthalpy , and 4-velocity of the fluid ; @xmath30 is the metric tensor of signature @xmath31 .",
    "the covariant equations can be written as a first order system of hyperbolic evolution equations in conservation form with source terms : @xmath32 for our study , it is important to use a conservative formulation , because it ensures correct shock wave propagation speeds when evolved by means of a finite volume scheme .",
    "the evolved hydrodynamic variables are @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the determinant of the 3-metric , @xmath35 the 3-velocity , and @xmath36 the corresponding lorentz factor . in the newtonian limit",
    "using cartesian coordinates , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 reduce to mass density , energy density , and momentum density .",
    "the flux terms @xmath40 are given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the coordinate velocity of the fluid and @xmath43 the lapse function .",
    "the evolution equations need to be completed by an equation of state ( eos ) to compute the pressure .",
    "we choose a polytropic eos defined by @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant density scale , and the constant @xmath46 is the polytropic exponent .    when assuming a one - parametric eos , the evolution equations ( [ eq_qconslaw ] ) are over - determined .",
    "therefore , we do not evolve the energy density @xmath38 , but recompute it from the remaining variables and the eos .",
    "the physical implications will be discussed in the next subsection .",
    "the above formulation is used by many modern relativistic codes . for a review",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "like most codes , the pizza  code is based on a hrsc ( high resolution shock capturing ) scheme , which was however optimized for quasistationary simulations .",
    "the difference to standard hrsc schemes is that source and flux terms are treated more consistently , making use of a special formulation of the source terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq_qconslaw ] ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the code is able to preserve a stationary star to high accuracy . for details ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one of the weak points of current relativistic hydrodynamic schemes is the treatment of the stellar surface , where the numerical schemes designed for the interior would break down without further measures .",
    "the most common remedy is to enforce an artificial atmosphere of low density .",
    "the original pizza  code described in @xcite used a different workaround , which works perfectly for low amplitude oscillations .",
    "unfortunately , we found that it yields unsatisfactory results for high amplitude oscillations in conjunction with a stiff eos .",
    "for the results in this article , we used yet another method of treating the surface . in short ,",
    "it is based on a smooth transition of the numerical flux , between the formally correct expression at and above a certain density , and a flux which causes no acceleration at zero density .",
    "the local density scale for the beginning of the transition is computed from the local gravity , using an expression which corresponds to the average density gradient of the stationary model near the stellar surface times the grid spacing .",
    "no artificial atmosphere is used . to prevent negative densities ,",
    "the flux is limited .",
    "the details of the scheme will be described in a forthcoming publication .",
    "we just note that the evolution below the aforementioned density scale is still plain wrong , like it is the case with other common schemes . due to the low densities involved ,",
    "the huge local errors at the surface have only limited impact on the global evolution .",
    "nevertheless , the surface is an important source of numerical errors for this study , in particular with regard to the numerical damping .",
    "the code has been tested on shock tube problems , linear oscillations of neutron stars , see @xcite , and recently with self - gravitating relativistic tori . on the timescales of the simulations presented here ,",
    "the code is able to evolve the stationary background model without significant changes in density or rotation profile .",
    "in contrast to codes using artificial atmospheres , our code exactly conserves the total mass .",
    "we use cartesian grids for three - dimensional simulations , cylindrical coordinates for two - dimensional ones , and spherical coordinates for one - dimensional problems .",
    "the rigidly rotating models are evolved in the corotating frame . to save computation time , we further assume equatorial symmetry . finally , we apply vacuum outer boundary conditions , such that any material hitting the outer boundary is lost , and monitor the total mass to detect this case .      for some of our results",
    ", shock formation plays an important role .",
    "the use of a polytropic eos then becomes one of the main limitations , as will be explained in the following .",
    "for any ideal fluid system with a two - parametric eos , the physically correct solution evolves adiabatically as long as there are no shock waves present . for initial data which is isentropic ,",
    "the evolution in the absence of shocks is thus the same as for an one - parametric eos corresponding to a curve of constant specific entropy of the two - parametric eos .",
    "the polytropic eos used in our simulations are the curves of constant specific entropy of the ideal gas eos given by @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the specific internal energy and @xmath46 matches the polytropic exponent",
    ". our simulations are therefore equivalent to the case of an ideal gas eos with isentropic initial data , until shock waves form .",
    "hence we can accurately predict the onset of shock formation .",
    "after the shocks form , using the polytropic eos becomes unphysical .",
    "formally , the reduced system of evolution equations for the polytropic case admits solutions with discontinuities .",
    "however those differ from realistic shock waves in two aspects : there is no entropy production , i.e. shock heating , and the local conservation of energy is violated",
    ".    nevertheless , we also present results based on the evolution after shock formation . for this",
    ", we make the assumption that the main difference between shock solutions for hot and cold eos is that the kinetic energy converted into heat for the correct solution is simply lost when using the cold eos , while the evolution of the density profile remains similar .",
    "although this is clearly a strong simplification , the results may serve as a first estimate .",
    "the reason why we do not simply use the ideal gas eos is purely technical : the version of our code which is capable of evolving two - parametric eoss is using a method of treating the surface which is not well suited for high amplitude oscillations .",
    "fortunately , the only results depending on evolutions beyond shock formation are the damping times of axisymmetric oscillations , but not the critical amplitudes for the onset of shock formation ; for the nonaxisymmetric oscillations , no significant shocks occur , and hence the use of the polytropic eos is perfectly valid there .",
    "to extract gravitational waves , we use the multipole formalism for newtonian sources , as described in @xcite . in this formalism",
    ", the radiation field at distance @xmath3 far away from the source is expanded in terms of spin tensor harmonics @xmath49 , \\label{eq_gwstrain}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] and the total gravitational luminosity is given by @xmath50 in the newtonian limit , the coefficients of the radiation field multipole expansion can be expressed in terms of the mass- and current - multipoles of the source @xmath51 with the multipole moments given by @xmath52 the above integrals are defined in the inertial frame , and @xmath53 denotes the vector spherical harmonics of magnetic type .    the error induced by using the above formulas for sources as relativistic as neutron stars is difficult to estimate analytically . in @xcite , results using the quadrupole formula are compared with direct wave extraction methods for the case of a pulsating neutron star model , finding an error around 10 - 20% in the strain amplitude .",
    "however , this error does not directly carry over to our results .",
    "the reason is that besides neglecting relativistic corrections , another error arises from the ambiguity of choosing a coordinate system for strongly curved spacetimes .",
    "this depends not only on the model , but also on the gauge choices made when computing the initial data . to get a rough estimate for the deviation from euclidean geometry , we compute @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the equatorial and polar coordinate radius , while @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 are the proper equatorial radius , proper polar radius , and equatorial circumferential radius .    from this",
    "average quantities we estimate the error of the multipole moments by assuming that the radius @xmath3 in eq .",
    "( [ eq_mass_mult ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq_curr_mult ] ) is wrong by a constant factor @xmath60 , in the sense that the correct value is in the range @xmath61 $ ] , and that the volume element @xmath62 is wrong by a factor of @xmath63 .",
    "we further set @xmath60 to the maximum over @xmath64 and the reciprocal values .    in consequence , the strain amplitude ( which is mainly due to the @xmath65 mass multipoles )",
    "would be wrong by a factor @xmath66 .",
    "while for most of our models , @xmath67 is in the range 1.22 , it is as big as 13 in one case .",
    "this shows how dangerous it is to generalize error bounds for the quadrupole formula computed for a `` typical '' neutron star model .",
    "our estimate does not take into account the possibility that large cancellations occur in the integrals for the multipole moments . in this study",
    ", this affects the quasiradial @xmath20-mode oscillations , in particular for slowly rotating stars . for those",
    ", we do not compute the error ; to obtain robust results , fully relativistic studies are needed .    to implement the above formalism",
    ", we compute the multipole moments in the corotating frame used in our simulations . for the current multipoles ,",
    "we nevertheless use the inertial frame velocity in the integrals .",
    "it is straightforward to show that the multipole moments in the inertial frame are given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the multipole moments computed in the corotating frame defined by @xmath71 , with @xmath72 being the angular velocity of the star .",
    "the multipole moments are computed during the evolution with a sampling rate of @xmath73 .",
    "when evaluating time derivatives of 2nd order or higher , special care has to be taken to avoid amplification of high frequency numerical noise . for this",
    ", we first apply numerical smoothing by convolution of the time series with a blackman window function .",
    "derivatives up to 3rd order are then computed using cubic splines . for derivatives of 4th and 5th order , we first compute the 3rd derivative and than apply the whole scheme again .",
    "we computed the frequency response function of the resulting scheme , which effectively cuts off contributions to the gravitational wave ( gw ) signal above @xmath74 . in the frequency range of the actual signal ,",
    "the loss of strain amplitude due to the smoothing stays below 15% .",
    "although only the @xmath65 mass multipoles are important for our problems , we generally compute all mass multipole moments up to @xmath75 , and the current multipoles with @xmath76 ,    the second important error for the strain , beside the use of the multipole formula , is due to the cowling approximation , which is known to cause a significant error in the oscillation frequencies . given an estimate for the inertial frame frequency @xmath77 of a harmonic oscillation in full gr , one can approximate the strain amplitude @xmath78 by @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are frequency and strain amplitude in the cowling approximation .      in order to measure the damping of oscillations , we monitor the evolution of an average corotating velocity defined by @xmath82 where @xmath43 and @xmath83 are lapse function and shift vector . since we are working in the corotating frame",
    ", @xmath84 is a corotating velocity .",
    "this measure is zero if and only if the fluid velocity is everywhere the same as for the unperturbed stationary star . for the nonrotating case in the newtonian limit , @xmath85 is also directly related to the total kinetic energy .",
    "as long as there is only one dominant oscillation mode , the decay of @xmath85 is a measure for the decay of the mode amplitude . on the other hand , it is not sensitive to energy transfer from one oscillation mode to another .    from the evolution ,",
    "we extract three quantities .    * the initial amplitude @xmath86 . * the final amplitude .",
    "since @xmath85 is oscillating , we use the maximum amplitude during the last oscillation cycle , @xmath87 where @xmath88 is the time over which we evolved the system and @xmath89 is the period of the oscillation mode used to perturb the system . *",
    "the timescale @xmath90 of the initial decay of @xmath85 , which we define as @xmath91 where @xmath89 is the oscillation period of the mode used for perturbation , and @xmath92 .    to detect the presence of shocks ,",
    "we make use of the fact that there exists a conserved energy when using the cowling approximation , given by @xmath93 more precisely , @xmath94 is conserved for smooth and weak solutions of eq .",
    "( [ eq_div_tmunu ] ) . as mentioned",
    ", shock solutions of the reduced system of equations used with a one - parametric eos violate the local energy conservation , and thus the conservation of @xmath94 .",
    "thus , any change of @xmath94 points to the existence of shock waves .      to extract eigenfunctions",
    ", we use the mode recycling method described in @xcite .",
    "in short , we perturb the star using a generic perturbation to excite different modes and extract their frequencies using fourier analysis . then we extract a first guess of the eigenfunction by evaluating at each point of the numerical grid the fourier integral of specific energy and velocity perturbations at the frequency of the desired mode .",
    "the estimate of the eigenfunction obtained in this way is in general still contaminated with other modes , due to the finite evolution time .",
    "therefore , additional simulations are performed , using the eigenfunction obtained in the previous step as initial perturbation , until only the desired oscillation mode is present in the evolution .",
    "we further improved this scheme by making use of the fact that for any axisymmetric star , the eigenfunctions of @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 can be written in the form @xmath98 the two - dimensional eigenfunction @xmath99 is real - valued and has a well defined @xmath100-parity .",

    "errors due to the presence of unwanted modes with different @xmath105-dependency are strongly suppressed during the computation of @xmath106 .",
    "this step is absolutely necessary to separate co- and counter - rotating modes for slowly rotating stars , since their frequencies approach each other .",
    "it seems plausible to take the real or imaginary part of @xmath106 as estimate for the eigenfunction .",
    "however , this is a bad idea since the phase is arbitrary , which can lead to strong suppression of the actual eigenfunction with respect to numerical errors .",

    "this only depends on the detector and the computational resources for data analysis .",
    "if we assume at least a few hundred cycles , the @xmath124  mode at the onset of strong damping is detectable with advanced ligo at a distance of 10@xmath151 . under the assumption that the saturation amplitude of the cfs instability of the @xmath124  mode is only limited by the strong damping effects investigated in this work",
    ", it would be possible to detect sources as far away as the virgo galaxy cluster . to compute the actual saturation amplitude however ,",
    "perturbative studies at lower amplitudes are needed .",
    "the numbers above are valid for model ma65 , which is an extreme case .",

    "the reason is that the strain scales with the square of the mode frequency in the inertial frame , which for the @xmath124  modes crosses zero when the rotation rate falls below the neutral point . keeping mass , eos , and mode amplitude @xmath85 fixed",

    "further , it is safe to assume that the amplitude marking the onset of nonlinearity behaves smooth near the neutral point , since the rotation rate influences the dissipation effects mainly via the centrifugal force , and the inertial modes participating in mode coupling depend on the coriolis force ; both forces depend on the absolute rotation rate .    for frequencies in the range 0.12",
    "times the @xmath124-mode frequency of model ma65 , the sensitivity curve of advanced ligo is quite flat . in this range ,",
    "the _ upper limit _ we find for the distance at which we can observe the @xmath124  mode roughly scales with @xmath156 .    since model ma65 is close to the kepler limit , the strain can not be increased significantly by increasing the rotation rate ; on the contrary , we expect that nonlinear effects set in much earlier when approaching the kepler limit further , as observed for model mc65 .",
    "further , we doubt that one can construct models where the frequency of the cfs - unstable @xmath124  modes is more than three times higher without resorting to extremely unrealistic eoss . on the other hand , this statement only applies to uniformly rotating stars ; it might be fruitful to investigate differentially rotating models as well .",
    "another restriction for detection of continuous signals is currently given by the limited computing resources for data analysis , which prevents to search the whole parameter space for signals .",
    "in particular , searches @xcite for continuous signals in early data from the 5th science run of ligo assumed a maximum time derivative of the signal frequency .",
    "those searches where targeted to signals from spinning nonaxisymmetric neutron stars , based on estimates on the maximum sustainable ellipticity .",
    "the luminosity produced by such sources is orders of magnitude below the upper limit we computed for the cfs - unstable @xmath124  mode of model ma65 .",
    "accordingly , our models spin down much faster . assuming that the mode frequency @xmath117 in the corotating frame stays constant",
    ", the decrease of the signal frequency , i.e. the mode frequency in the inertial frame , is @xmath157 , provided that @xmath158 .",
    "the spin - down rate can be computed from the expressions for the angular momentum lost by gravitational waves given in @xcite and the moment of inertia computed by the initial data code .",
    "for the @xmath124  mode of model ma65 at the upper limit , we compute a signal frequency decrease of @xmath159 , which is orders of magnitude outside the ranges searched in @xcite . for models closer to the neutral point",
    ", luminosity and spin - down rate would be smaller .",

    "it is beyond the scope of this article to estimate the amplitude of oscillations excited by such events .",
    "we investigate the detectability for a given amplitude , assuming no further excitation . in that case ,",
    "the amplitude starts decaying due to strong nonlinear damping , until it reaches a threshold where only slow damping occurs .    in order to detect such an event",
    ", one could either search in short segments of the detector data for the initial strong signal , or search for the tail by investigating long time intervals .",
    "since any long tail has an amplitude below the onset of strong damping , we already know the maximum strain amplitudes , which are given in figure  [ fig_detect_onset ] and [ fig_detect_onset_axi ] . the big unknown is the number of available cycles , which depends on the residual damping timescale of the tail , and thus can not be computed by nonlinear evolution .    to estimate the detectability of the initial peak , we neglect the tail , assume a pure exponential decay , and limit the integration time to @xmath165 .",

    "the results are plotted in figure  [ fig_eff_strain ] .",
    "as one can see , the increase in amplitude after the onset of nonlinearity competes with the rapid decrease in signal duration , and in most cases the latter wins .",

    "for this , we used a relativistic evolution code , but kept the spacetime fixed .",
    "our neutron star models are rigidly rotating ideal fluid configurations with polytropic eoss of different stiffness , and typical neutron star masses in the range 1.41.9 solar masses .",
    "the oscillation modes we considered are the axisymmetric @xmath20and @xmath123  modes , the corotating @xmath125  mode , and the counter - rotating @xmath124  mode .",
    "our main interest is the @xmath124  mode of one model ( ma65 ) , which can be excited by the cfs instability in full gr , and which is therefore a candidate for detectable gravitational waves from rapidly rotating neutron stars .",
    "we found different damping mechanisms for axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric modes .",
    "axisymmetric oscillations of high initial amplitude are rapidly damped by formation of shocks in the outer layers of the star , until the amplitude falls below a certain threshold .",
    "below the threshold we observed no further energy dissipation on the timescales of our evolutions .",
    "although we are using a one - parametric eos , our results accurately determine the onset of shock formation , and provide a first estimate for the magnitude of energy dissipation by shocks .",
    "we find that the damping timescale decreases with increasing amplitude , down to a few oscillation cycles .",
    "the damping timescale and the threshold vary by one order of magnitude for the different eoss we investigated .",
    "the stiffer the eos , the higher amplitudes are possible before shocks form , and also the damping observed at the highest amplitudes is faster for stiffer eoss .    with increasing rotation rate ,",
    "nonlinear effects start at lower amplitudes . however , the influence of rotation on the damping of axisymmetric modes is relatively weak until close to the kepler limit , where the damping threshold decreases to zero . at the kepler",
    "limit , damping by mass shedding occurs .",
    "we explain this behavior by the fact that the material at the equator is bound less strongly for faster rotation .    for the nonaxisymmetric oscillations ,",
    "damping is mainly caused by wave breaking and nonlinear mode coupling effects , while shock formation only occurs in low density regions at the stellar surface .",
    "as for axisymmetric modes , nonlinear damping sets in at lower amplitudes when increasing the rotation rate or decreasing the stiffness of the eos .    since wave breaking is a surface effect , we feel that an accurate description of the damping at high amplitudes requires an improved numerical treatment of the surface and probably a better physical model as well , considering e.g. a hot envelope for a proto - neutron star , a solid crust for a cold star ( although in that case , one would also have to add superfluidity ) , and the influence of the magnetic field .",
    "significant mode coupling was only observed for rapidly rotating models , where the main mechanism seems to be a 1:2 resonance with high order @xmath169 inertial modes . for cfs - unstable models ,",
    "such a resonance is always possible .",
    "further , the coupling is most probably active already at lower amplitudes , but on timescales too long for nonlinear study .",
    "since the growth time of cfs - unstable modes is longer as well , it will be necessary to investigate the coupling at lower amplitudes perturbatively to determine the saturation amplitudes .",
    "nevertheless , we were able to provide upper limits .",
    "next , we computed the gravitational wave strain and luminosity of several modes in the linear regime .",
    "the cfs - unstable @xmath124  mode was found to be a weak emitter ; at the same amplitude , the strain is thirty times lower than for the axisymmetric @xmath123  mode .",
    "this is mainly due to the low frequency of the @xmath124  mode in the inertial frame . to construct models",
    "for which this mode is more luminous , one needs to further separate the kepler limit from the neutral point ( where the @xmath124  mode has zero inertial frame frequency ) .",
    "this can either be done by increasing the stiffness of the eos , or probably by introducing differential rotation .",
    "since our cfs - unstable model already has a relatively stiff eos ( @xmath170 ) , we consider the latter more realistic .",
    "we also found that the quasiradial @xmath20  modes of rapidly rotating models emit gravitational waves almost as efficient as the @xmath123  modes .",
    "for the cfs - unstable model ma65 , the @xmath20  mode emits stronger gravitational waves than the @xmath124  mode at the same amplitude .",
    "the reason is that the eigenfunction of the @xmath20  mode has a considerable quadrupole moment due to the oblateness of the star , as well as the high oscillation frequency .",
    "further we investigated the gravitational waves produced by oscillations in the nonlinear regime .",
    "the maximum strain we observed usually agrees with the values extrapolated from the linear regime up to a factor of 3 ( 2 for the axisymmetric modes ) . for the cfs - unstable @xmath124  mode",
    "however , we found that the signal is dominated by secondary modes .",
    "we consider those as a feature of our particular setup ; their amplitudes most likely depends on the exact way the main mode was excited . to compute the strain for the case of",
    "a @xmath124  mode grown to high amplitude by the cfs instability , it will be necessary to model carefully the growth of secondary modes , especially at higher frequencies .",
    "secondary modes dominate the strain only for the cfs - unstable @xmath124  mode , because it is the weakest emitter . for models where it has a higher frequency , secondary modes are probably less important .    finally , we combined the results on strong damping and luminosity to establish upper limits on the gw detectability of various modes .",
    "there are two astrophysically relevant cases : a continuous emission by cfs - unstable @xmath124  modes at saturation amplitude , and stable modes excited by some violent event .    from the upper limit for the saturation amplitude of the cfs instability",
    ", we obtain an upper limit on corresponding gravitational strain .",
    "the detectability of a continuous signal depends on the integration time .",
    "if we consider searches using time windows containing at least a few hundred cycles , the @xmath124  mode ( of model ma65 ) oscillating at the upper limit will be detectable at distances around @xmath2 with advanced ligo .",
    "this distance scales approximately quadratically with the mode frequency in the inertial frame .",
    "current searches for continuous signals in the 5th ligo science run are not sensitive to the above source since they exclude the high spindown rates caused by gravitational waves of such strength .",
    "we stress again that the actual saturation amplitude may be considerably lower than the upper limits we provided .",
    "we also note that we did not take into account the secondary excited modes ; a careful study of the couplings during the growth phase might reveal an enhanced detectability .    for stable modes excited by a sudden violent event",
    ", we find that the detectability does not significantly increase for amplitudes above the onset of strong damping , since the oscillation is quickly damped below the threshold and stays there .",
    "the detectability thus depends on the effective number of wave cycles in the tail , and thus on the residual slow damping at amplitudes near the threshold .",
    "if this information becomes available for a given mode , e.g. using perturbative techniques , the detectability can be computed from the luminosities we provided .",
    "however , we find that the @xmath123  modes oscillating near the strong damping threshold are detectable with advanced ligo at least up to distances of @xmath171 .",
    "the strong damping effects thus impose only weak limits on the detectability of those ; for most processes , the important factor will probably be the strength of the excitation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that although some of the questions we rise can only be computed with perturbation theory , only a nonlinear study like ours can provide the necessary limits for the amplitudes at which perturbation theory can be safely applied .",
