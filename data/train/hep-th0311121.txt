    "the idea that we live in more than the observed @xmath0 dimensions has been of huge interest ever since it was first suggested by kaluza and klein in the 1920s @xcite .",
    "they studied a five - dimensional gravitational theory in a model with an extra _ compact _ dimension .",
    "the effective four dimensional theory then contains @xmath0 dimensional gravity as well as the electromagnetic fields and a scalar field . in a similar way , ( super)string theories contain extra _ compact _ dimensions @xcite ( superstring theories have @xmath1 extra compact dimensions ) with size of the order of the planck length @xmath2 .",
    "an example is the calabi - yau space in heterotic string theory whose properties determine the low energy effective field theory .",
    "other models , which were discussed extensively in recent years are so - called brane world scenarios @xcite which assume that the standard model ( sm ) fields are confined to a @xmath3-brane ( a @xmath4 dimensional submanifold ) which is embedded in a higher dimensional space - time .",
    "the extra dimensions now are _ non - compact_. since gravity is a property of space - time itself , a model which describes appropriately the well - tested newton s law should localise gravity well enough to the @xmath3-brane .",
    "this was achieved in @xcite by placing a @xmath3-brane into @xmath5 dimensions with the @xmath5th dimension being infinite . for the localisation of gravity in this model",
    ", the brane tension has to be fine - tuned to the negative bulk cosmological constant .",
    "recently , the localisation of gravity on different topological defects has been discussed @xcite .",
    "this includes domain walls @xcite , nielsen - olesen strings @xcite , and magnetic monopoles @xcite in @xmath5 , @xmath1 and @xmath6 space - time dimensions , respectively .",
    "it was found @xcite that gravity - localising ( so - called `` warped '' ) solutions are possible if certain relations between the defect s tensions hold . while in the case of domain walls and strings , gravity can only be localised when the bulk cosmological constant is negative , for magnetic monopoles the gravity - localisation is possible for both signs of the cosmological constant .",
    "originally introduced to remove singularities associated with point - like charges in electrodynamics @xcite , the generalisation of the born - infeld ( bi ) action to non - abelian gauge fields has gained a lot of interest in topics related to string theory @xcite .",
    "it became apparent that when studying low energy effective actions of string theory , the part of the lagrangian containing the abelian maxwell field strength tensor and its non - abelian counterpart in yang - mills theories has to be replaced by a corresponding ( resp .",
    "abelian and non - abelian ) bi term .",
    "that s why it seems interesting to generalise the brane world scenario for 6-dimensional nielsen - olesen strings recently proposed by giovannini , meyer and shaposhnikov ( gms ) @xcite to born - infeld actions .",
    "our paper is organised as follows : in section ii , we present the 6 dimensional einstein - born - infeld - abelian - higgs ( ebiah ) model , we give the equations of motion and especially present our analytic argument that no solutions , which localise gravity exist in the ebiah model . in section iii , we present our numerical results for both the ebiah model , namely , we present so - called `` anti - warped '' solutions , as well as for the limit of the einstein - abelian - higgs ( eah ) model . in this latter case , we put the emphasis on the connection between the gms solutions and the four types of solutions available in the eah model , namely the string branch , the inverted string branch , the melvin branch and the kasner branch @xcite . especially , we show that the `` warped '' solutions found in @xcite are the - by the cosmological constant - deformed inverted string solutions .",
    "we give our conclusions in section iv .",
    "we have the following @xmath1-dimensional action @xcite : @xmath7 where the standard gravity action reads @xmath8 @xmath9 is the bulk cosmological constant , @xmath10 is the fundamental gravity scale with @xmath11 and @xmath12 the determinant of the @xmath1-dimensional metric .",
    "the action @xmath13 for the einstein - born - infeld - abelian - higgs ( ebiah ) string is given by @xcite :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 with the covariant derivative @xmath16 and the field strength @xmath17 of the u(1 ) gauge potential @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is the vacuum expectation value of the complex valued higgs field @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the self - coupling constant of the higgs field .",
    "the ansatz for the @xmath1-dimensional metric reads @xcite : @xmath22 for the gauge and higgs field , we have @xcite : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the vorticity of the string .",
    "introducing the following dimensionless coordinate @xmath25 and the dimensionless function @xmath26 : @xmath27 the set of equations depends only on the following dimensionless coupling constants : @xmath28 the gravitational equations then read : @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    where @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 the euler - lagrange equations for the matter fields read : @xmath35 and @xmath36 the prime denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath25 .",
    "for @xmath37 these equations reduce to those studied in @xcite .",
    "the equations ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) can be combined to obtain the following two differential equations for the two unknown metric functions : @xmath38 which then gives : @xmath39 and @xmath40 which then reads : @xmath41      we require regularity at the origin @xmath42 which leads to the boundary conditions : @xmath43 the requirement for finiteness of the energy leads to : @xmath44      the string tensions are defined as follows : @xmath45 the relation between the tensions @xmath46 and @xmath47 can then be evaluated . using ( [ t0 ] ) and ( [ ttheta ] ) ,",
    "we find : @xmath48 and using ( [ eqp ] ) , we find : @xmath49 for warped solutions , the infinity term should vanish , while for @xmath42 , we use the boundary conditions ( [ bcx0 ] ) .",
    "thus : @xmath50 now , from @xcite , we know that @xmath51 in order to have solutions which localise gravity . however , since the rhs of ( [ rho ] ) is always negative , this relation can never be fulfilled , which leads us to the hypothesis that warped solutions do nt exist in the einstein - born - infeld model .",
    "before to discuss our numerical results for the ebiah model , let us explain the pattern of solutions in the @xmath52 case i.e. in the einstein - abelian - higgs ( eah ) model .",
    "since it was stated in @xcite that no attempt to classify the solutions is done , the following discussion can be seen as such a classification .",
    "we first discuss the solutions in the case @xmath53 .",
    "the pattern of solution in the 6-dimensional eah model is very similar to the one in the 4-dimensional eah model @xcite  : for generic values of @xmath54 , @xmath55 there are two branches of solutions : a branch for which @xmath56 and @xmath57 , where the parameters @xmath58 , @xmath59 depend on the coupling constants . for @xmath60 , the nielsen - olesen string solutions",
    "@xcite are recovered , this is why this branch of solutions is referred to as the _ string branch_.    for @xmath61 the nielsen - olesen string",
    "is slightly deformed by gravity and @xmath62 , @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath55 is increased ( with @xmath54 being fixed ) the parameter @xmath58 varies slowly while the parameter @xmath59 decreases linearly with @xmath55 such that it becomes negative at some critical value of @xmath55 , say @xmath64 .",
    "for @xmath65 the solutions continue to exist but , since the function @xmath66 possesses a zero , the solution is not regular on the full interval of the radial coordinate .",
    "the solutions for @xmath65 are called _ inverted string _ solutions .",
    "we have constructed solutions for the self - dual limit ( @xmath67 ) and for @xmath53 .",
    "we find that in complete agreement with the four dimensional case , the critical value @xmath68 and that in addition @xmath69 , while @xmath70 ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus for @xmath71 , @xmath66 is zero at some @xmath72 , @xmath73 .",
    "note that the function @xmath74 stays finite at @xmath75 .",
    "for the same values of the coupling constants a second branch of solutions , the so - called _ melvin branch _ , exists . in @xmath76 , the solutions on this branch behave like @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",
    "the constants @xmath79 and @xmath80 depend on the coupling constants of the model .",
    "there exist also solutions , the so - called _ kasner solutions _ , for @xmath65 .",
    "for these strongly coupled gravitating solution the function @xmath74 develops a node at some finite value of @xmath81 with @xmath82 , while at the same time the function @xmath83 . for @xmath67 , we present the dependence of the values @xmath79 and @xmath80 on the gravitational coupling @xmath55 in fig .  1 .",
    "we find that like in the case of the string branch @xmath68 .",
    "for @xmath84 , @xmath79 tends to zero , while @xmath80 tends to infinity .    from the discussion of the solutions in the @xmath53 limit",
    ", we note that the main feature is the existence of a critical value of @xmath55 , say @xmath85 , which clearly separates the classical solution into two distinguished domains ; string branch and melvin branch exist for @xmath86 , inverted string branch and kasner branch for @xmath87 .",
    "however , as was noted in @xcite , the domain of existence of the kasner solutions is limited .",
    "for the 4-dimensional kasner solutions , it was found that for fixed @xmath88 and varying @xmath89 , the value @xmath90 tends to infinity at @xmath91 .",
    "thus , we expect that in analogy in @xmath76 , the kasner solutions will exits only for small @xmath54 when @xmath53 .",
    "especially , for @xmath92 ( which is the value of @xmath54 mainly considered in this paper ) , we expect to find no kasner solutions for @xmath53 , @xmath93 .",
    "this is confirmed by our numerical results .",
    "we will now discuss , how this pattern evolves when the cosmological constant is negative and construct the domain of existence of solutions in the @xmath55-@xmath94-plane ( with @xmath54 fixed and @xmath95 , @xmath96 ) .",
    "our result are summarised in fig .  2 for @xmath67 , but we expect that the results are similar for generic values of @xmath54 .",
    "considering first the part of the plane for which @xmath97 , our numerical results indicate that both string branch and melvin branch exist up to a critical value @xmath98 ( or equivalently @xmath99 ) . in the limit @xmath100",
    ", the two solutions converge to a common solution indicated by the dashed line in fig .",
    "2 . this phenomenon persists also for @xmath101 finite and will thus be discussed in more detail in the next section . in order to make the connection with @xcite ,",
    "let us mention that the so - called `` anti - warped '' solutions in fig.s 15 and 17 of @xcite belong , respectively , to the string and melvin branch .",
    "let us now discuss the part of the @xmath55-@xmath94-plane with @xmath93 . as indicated in fig",
    ".  2 , below a critical line ( solid ) , which we denote @xmath102 , only inverted string solutions exist , while above this line only kasner solutions exist .",
    "the critical phenomenon which limits the domain of existence of the inverted string solutions is related to the occurence of a zero @xmath75 of the function @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , the numerical study of @xmath103 for @xmath54 , @xmath55 fixed and varying @xmath94 , reveals that @xmath103 is shifted to infinity for a finite value of @xmath94 , which coincides with the critical value of @xmath94 , @xmath102 , mentioned above .",
    "this phenomenon is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 for two pairs of values ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) such that @xmath104 .",
    "we plot the quantity @xmath103 in dependence on the bulk cosmological constant @xmath94 .",
    "clearly at some @xmath105 @xmath103 tends to infinity and it can be checked that the functions @xmath66 and @xmath74 become exponentially decaying .",
    "we find that @xmath106 and @xmath107 , which is in perfect agreement with the results of @xcite .",
    "stated in another way , the crucial point about the construction in @xcite is that the cosmological constant has to be fine tuned in such a way that the zero of the function @xmath66 is pushed to infinity and consequently the metric functions become exponentially decaying : @xmath108      classifying the solutions of the full ebiah equations is a vast task because of the occurence of four parameters to be varied .",
    "first , we therefore limited our investigation to the case @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "along with the case @xmath52 discussed above , we orientated first our numerical construction to small value of @xmath55 . in this case",
    ", the string and melvin branches continue to exist and the phenomenon that these two branches converge to a common solution for a @xmath94-depending critical value of @xmath55 is recovered .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  4 , where we plot the metric functions @xmath66 and @xmath74 of the `` anti - warped '' solutions corresponding to the string and melvin branches for @xmath112 .",
    "in this case , the critical value of @xmath55 is @xmath113 .    with this information",
    ", we constructed the domain of existence of solutions in the @xmath55-@xmath94-plane for @xmath67 and @xmath114 .",
    "first , we determined the critical value of @xmath55 , @xmath115 , for which the string and melvin solutions turn into closed solutions .",
    "we find that @xmath116 which differs only little from the value in the @xmath52 limit .",
    "for @xmath117 , we find -as mentioned before- that the domain of existence of the string and melvin solutions is restricted by a curve @xmath118 ( or @xmath119 ) , at which the two solutions converge to a common solution ( dashed line in fig .  5 ) .",
    "this is in complete analogy to the @xmath52 limit .",
    "in this part of the @xmath55-@xmath94-plane , however , the domain of existence of the melvin solutions is restricted by another phenomenon . at some @xmath120 ( or @xmath121 , dotted - dashed line in fig .",
    "5 ) with @xmath122 , the value of the magnetic field at the origin tends to infinity .",
    "this phenomenon was previously noted for the @xmath123 , @xmath53 case in @xcite .",
    "thus , melvin solutions exist only in a small part of the @xmath55-@xmath94-plane , namely for @xmath124 .    now turning to solutions for @xmath65 , again",
    ", we find no kasner solutions for @xmath53 since @xmath67 is too large .",
    "we were only able to construct inverted string solutions for @xmath67 , @xmath114 and @xmath53 .",
    "the inverted string solutions exist up to a critical value @xmath125 ( or @xmath126 ) , solid line in fig .  5 ) .",
    "for @xmath127 only kasner solutions exist .",
    "following our analytic argument in section ii.d .",
    "no `` warped solutions '' exist such that the solid line in fig .",
    "5 now represents a line where no solutions at all exist .",
    "thus our numerical results confirm the analytic argument that no gravitation - localising solutions exist in a born - infeld brane world scenario .",
    "in this paper , we have studied a 6-dimensional einstein - born - infeld - abelian - higgs model in a brane world scenario recently suggested by @xcite . in the @xmath52 limit",
    ", our model reduces to that of @xcite . as a cross - check of our model",
    ", we reconsidered the solutions found in this paper , and managed to determine the domain of the @xmath55-@xmath94-plane in which solutions of this model exist .",
    "especially , we identify the four different types of branches that exist for @xmath53 , namely the string , melvin , inverted string and kasner branches and put the emphasis on the extention of these branches in the @xmath128 case .",
    "we identified the warped solution of @xcite as the solution sitting on the limit of the domain of existence of the inverted string solution ( decreasing @xmath94 and keeping the other parameters fixed ) .",
    "we also considered the influence of the born - infeld interaction on the solutions and recovered the existence of the four types of solutions in this case .",
    "we construct the domain of existence of solutions in the @xmath55-@xmath94-plane for @xmath67 and @xmath114 . especially , we find that in agreement with our analytic argument , which uses the reasoning based on the string tensions of @xcite , no `` warped solutions '' exist in the born - infeld case .",
    "let us remark that we have only taken into account the born - infeld terms of the effective action of string theory and have neglected higher derivative corrections in this paper . these arise naturally in the effective action of open string theory and",
    "are related to the essential non - locality of string field theory .",
    "these terms could , of course , influence the `` no - go '' result of this paper .",
