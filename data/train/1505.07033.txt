    "in this paper , we describe a low - cost , open - access , cubesat - based calibration instrument called calsat that is designed to support ground - based and sub - orbital experiments searching for various polarization signals in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "the cmb is a bath of photons that permeates all of space and carries an image of the universe as it was 380,000 years after the big bang .",
    "this image spans the entire sky , but it is not visible to the human eye because the frequency spectrum of the cmb peaks in the millimeter - wave region of the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "physical processes that operated in the universe when the cmb formed left an imprint that can be detected today .",
    "this imprint is observed as angular intensity and linear polarization anisotropies .",
    "these primordial cmb anisotropies have proven to be a treasure trove of cosmological information .",
    "for example , the precise characterization of the intensity ( or temperature ) anisotropy of the cmb has helped reveal that spacetime is flat , the universe is 13.8 billion years old , and the energy content of the universe is dominated by cold dark matter and dark energy  ( see for example , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the density inhomogeneities that produced the detected temperature anisotropies theoretically should generate , through thomson scattering during the epoch of recombination , a curl - free polarization signal known as `` e - mode '' polarization .",
    "this companion signal has also been observed at the theoretically expected level providing further confidence in the @xmath0cdm cosmological model  ( see for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .     and a non - primordial b - mode signal that is produced when large - scale structure converts e - modes to b - modes via gravitational lensing ( dash - dot ) . for comparison ,",
    "igw signal curves for @xmath1 are also plotted . the te , tb and eb power spectra",
    "are plotted on the right .",
    "the details of the experiment simulation , which shows the effect of instrument - induced polarization rotation , are discussed in section  [ sec : polarimeter_calibration ] .",
    "the green circles and diamonds show the spurious bb signal for 2.0  deg and 0.2  deg of polarization rotation , respectively.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the inflationary cosmological paradigm posits that a burst of exponential spacetime expansion , called inflation , took place during the first fraction of a second after the big bang .",
    "observational evidence to date supports this paradigm and has given it a strong footing , though the precise physical mechanism that caused inflation is unknown .",
    "inflation should have produced a stochastic background of gravitational waves .",
    "these gravitational waves would have produced polarization signals separable from e - modes by their divergence - free `` b - mode '' signature  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of this inflationary gravitational wave ( igw ) b - mode signal is proportional to the energy scale at which inflation occurred . see for example , the dashed curves in figure  [ fig : ps ] and note that the igw signal amplitude is commonly parameterized as @xmath2 , the so - called tensor - to - scalar ratio , which is related to the energy scale of inflation is related to the energy scale of inflation as @xmath3  [ gev ] . ]",
    "@xcite . if the igw signal ultimately is discovered , then the energy scale of inflation would be experimentally ascertained .",
    "this measurement would place a tight constraint on the theoretical models that describe the inflation mechanism , and this constraint would be a breakthrough for both astrophysics and particle physics because there is no way to create inflation - like conditions in a laboratory or particle accelerator .",
    "the igw signal is currently the primary focus of cmb research , and we will discuss the status of current measurements at the end of section  [ sec : polarimeter_calibration ] .",
    "in addition to the igw signal , other cmb polarization signals promise to deliver valuable cosmological information .",
    "non - primordial b - modes are generated when e - modes are gravitationally lensed by large - scale structures in the universe ( see the dash - dot curve in figure  [ fig : ps ] ) .",
    "this lensing b - mode signal is sensitive to physical parameters such as the sum of the neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "b - mode polarization can also be used to probe physics outside the standard cosmological picture .",
    "temperature to b - mode correlations ( tb ) and e - mode and b - mode correlations ( eb ) are expected to vanish in the standard model .",
    "therefore , these estimators are sensitive probes for physics outside the standard model if the correlation signals are found to be non - zero . a variety of candidate non - standard - model physical mechanisms that produce cosmological polarization rotation ( cpr ) already have been identified .",
    "parity violation in the electromagnetic sector via a chern - simons coupling can produce tb and eb correlations  @xcite .",
    "a coupling of a pseudo - scalar field to electromagnetism would violate the einstein equivalence principle and would result in tb and eb correlations  @xcite .",
    "tb and eb correlations can also be used to test chiral gravity models  @xcite and to search for primordial magnetic fields  @xcite .    .",
    "a comparison between calsat and tau  a measurements from planck , wmap and the iram telescope .",
    "the polarization angle uncertainty requirement from the weiss report is 0.2  deg  @xcite .",
    "the available measurements of tau  a do not meet this specification because the smallest systematic error to date is 0.5  deg .",
    "also , the high - resolution  @xcite measurement shows that the polarization intensity morphology of tau  a is complicated . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     , @xmath4 and the brightness temperature is 155  k for the 40  ghz spectral band and 173  k for the other spectral bands  @xcite .",
    "the calsat curves are discussed in section  [ sec : detectability ] .",
    "an additional comparison between calsat and tau  a is given in table  [ table : tau_a ] .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]",
    "for calsat to be useful , the detected calibration signal needs to be large when compared with the noise level of the calibration measurement .",
    "it is difficult to forecast the precise characteristics of every instrument that might observe calsat .",
    "therefore , to assess the detectability , three primary assumptions were made .",
    "first , we assumed the aperture diameter of any instrument observing calsat is between 0.3 and 10  m , which is the current range for cmb experiments .",
    "second , we assumed a@xmath5 and @xmath4 . here",
    ", @xmath6 is the aperture area , @xmath7 is the solid angle of the cmb telescope beam , and @xmath8 is the frequency of the incoming radiation with @xmath9 being the center frequency of the spectral band of the polarimeter .",
    "third , we assumed the noise in the calibration measurement is dominated by photon noise from the cmb for balloon - borne measurements and the atmosphere for ground - based measurements .    to estimate the photon noise ,",
    "spectral radiance curves were computed using the publicly available _ am _ atmospheric modeling software packagespaine / am/ ] .",
    "am _ version 8.0 , which implements o@xmath10 line mixing and non - resonant absorption near 60  ghz .",
    "earlier versions of _ am _ did not model these effects , so these earlier versions had accuracy issues , which do not affect our calculations . the atmospheric profiles for the following six observatories were used in these simulations : south pole , chajnantor , summit station in greenland , mauna  kea , and balloon - borne observatories near ft .",
    "sumner , new mexico , and mcmurdo in antarctica .",
    "for all sites , the zenith angle for observations was set to 45  deg .",
    "the altitude of the balloon - borne observatories was assumed to be 30  km .",
    "for the south pole , chajnantor , greenland , and mauna  kea observatories , the ambient temperature and pwv was assumed to be 230 , 275 , 248 and 275  k , and 1 , 1 , 1 and 4  mm , respectively .",
    "given these conservative assumptions , the background power in the telescope beam and the associated photon noise equivalent power ( nep ) were computed .",
    "the background power in the telescope beam was computed using @xmath11,~~\\mbox{where}~~q(\\nu ) = \\alpha~{\\cal t}(\\nu)~a \\omega~{\\cal b}(\\nu ) .",
    "\\label{eq : power}\\ ] ] and the photon nep was computed using @xmath12 .",
    "\\label{eq : nep}\\ ] ] these equations are commonly used and their derivation can be found in the literature @xcite . for our calculations , @xmath13 is the spectral radiance computed by _ am _ , @xmath14 is the spectral band - pass filter , which is a top - hat with a width equal to @xmath15 and a@xmath5 .",
    "we assumed observations are made with detectors that are sensitive to a single - polarization , so @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : loading_nep ] and table  [ table : signal_to_noise ] . the expected millimeter - wave power from calsat at the telescope aperture",
    "was computed using the following equation : @xmath18,~~\\mbox{where}~~\\omega = \\pi \\left ( \\tan^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{d}{2d } \\right ) \\right)^2 .",
    "\\label{eq : omega}\\ ] ] here , @xmath19 is the millimeter - wave power from the source , @xmath20 is the horn gain in dbi , @xmath21 is the aperture diameter of the telescope , and @xmath22 is the distance between calsat and the telescope ; @xmath7 is the solid angle subtended by the telescope aperture as viewed from calsat , and it is schematically shown in figure  [ fig : operation ] .",
    "the power arriving in the telescope aperture from calsat is plotted versus telescope aperture diameter in figure  [ fig : calsat_and_jupiter ] . for comparison , the power arriving in the telescope aperture from jupiter , which is a bright and commonly used _",
    "unpolarized _ calibrator , was also computed and plotted alongside the calsat curves in this figure .",
    "this analysis shows that ( i ) the brightness of calsat is similar to the brightness of the background , ( ii ) the brightness of calsat is comparable to jupiter , and ( iii ) the signal - to - noise ratio for one second of integration is typically between 1,000 and 100,000 .",
    "these are all characteristics of an ideal calibration source .",
    "if calsat were significantly brighter than the background then the signal would likely saturate the detectors ( assuming tes bolometers are being used , which is the current standard at these frequencies ) .        the calsat instrument configuration presented in this paper",
    "was designed to support the following ongoing experiments and any associated follow - up experiments from these collaborations : act  @xcite , bicep / keck  @xcite , class  @xcite , groundbird  @xcite , ebex  @xcite , piper  @xcite , polarbear  @xcite , quijote  @xcite , spider  @xcite , and sptpol  @xcite .",
    "additional experiments that could use calsat are being designed : glp  @xcite , skip  @xcite , and qubic  @xcite . and the planned cmb - s4  @xcite program would benefit from calsat because it could be used to both accurately calibrate deep observations and combine results from different observatories .",
    "though calsat is designed for cmb polarization experiments , it could also straightforwardly be used to calibrate other observatories such as alma and the vla .",
    "as a narrow - band source , calsat is not designed to characterize the broad - band spectral properties of cmb polarimeters .",
    "instead it is designed to provide the critical relationship between the coordinate system of the polarimeter in the instrument frame and the coordinate system on the sky that defines the astrophysical @xmath23 and @xmath24 stokes parameters .",
    "the spectral bands in cmb polarimeters are typically broad , and some polarimeter technologies , such as the achromatic half - wave plate and the sinuous antenna multi - chroic pixel , have frequency dependent performance . therefore polarimeter calibration",
    "must be performed over the full spectral bandwidth for experiments using these technologies .",
    "cmb experiment teams must characterize the spectral properties of their instruments in the laboratory before deployment and then use the clean and simple calsat signals together with their lab - based instrument transfer functions during their calibration analyses .",
    "for example figure  [ fig : hwp_axis ] shows simulated modulation efficiency and polarimeter axis angle curves for an achromatic half - wave plate polarimeter .",
    "the 80.0 , 140 and 249  ghz calsat tones could be used to verify that the modulation efficiency is very close to unity at these frequencies and the polarimeter axis varies as expected as a function of frequency .",
    "calsat is programmed to listen for the ground station each orbit .",
    "if the radio uplink from the ground station fails , then the on - board computer turns the calsat tones off and wait for the link to be restored .",
    "this mode of operation guards against out - of - control behavior .",
    "if this program malfunctions and the tones stay on , then the batteries will drain and the instrument will shutdown because the power budget can not support continuous operation .",
    "therefore , the most likely failure mode is calsat would turn off within 24 hours and then de - orbit 16 years later .",
    "the selected tones match the amateur satellite service bands as stated in the text .",
    "we chose to use these bands because there is already an international agreement in place that allows instruments like calsat to broadcast in these bands .",
    "it is possible to request permission to broadcast using other frequencies for a limited time by applying for an `` experimental '' license from the fcc .",
    "we avoided using this approach as a baseline plan because there is some risk involved .",
    "projects using experimental licenses can not cause interference and they can not request protection from interference .",
    "the aforementioned table of frequency allocations shows that below 300  ghz , all frequencies are already allocated , so interference is possible .",
    "nevertheless , if calsat moves forward , every effort will be made to maximize the utility of the instrument by adjusting the frequencies so they accommodate all possible users .",
    "all experiments trying to extract cosmological information from the tb , eb and b - mode signals need a robust polarimeter calibration program that will allow the effect of instrument - induced errors to be mitigated during data analysis . a robust mitigation strategy for ipr , which is one of the most critical systematic errors ,",
    "has not yet been identified because a suitable celestial calibration source does not exist and ground - based solutions are challenging .",
    "moreover , the commonly used self - calibration technique , that uses the tb and eb spectra to remove any spurious b - mode signals , prohibits b - mode measurements from constraining the aforementioned isotropic departures from the standard model .",
    "calsat was designed to be a low - cost , open - access solution to the ipr calibration problem for the cmb community , and its global visibility makes calsat the only source that can be observed by all terrestrial and sub - orbital experiments .",
    "this global visibility makes calsat a powerful universal standard that permits comparison between experiments from different observatories using appreciably different measurement approaches .",
    "johnson , keating and kaufman acknowledge support from winning a buchalter cosmology prize ( second prize ) in 2014 for their paper entitled `` precision tests of parity violation over cosmological distances ''  @xcite .",
    "this paper explores the idea of using tb and eb spectra to study new physics via cpr , and these kinds of measurements rely on precise calibration enhancements ; calsat was used as an example of an enhanced calibration technique in this paper .",
    "we would like to thank ari buchalter and the buchalter cosmology prize advisory board and judging panel for acknowledging our work with this prize ."
