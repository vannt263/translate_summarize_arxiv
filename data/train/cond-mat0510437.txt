    "phase transitions do not generally occur in one - dimensional systems .",
    "their absence has been codified under a variety of conditions .",
    "van hove @xcite showed that , for particle systems with pair interactions of sufficiently short range , the free energy does not have any singularities .",
    "landau @xcite argued that a bistable system with finite interface energy will achieve an entropic gain by breaking up into a macroscopic number of domains , making macroscopic phase coexistence at any positive temperature impossible .",
    "his argument explains the absence of a phase transition in a large class of one - dimensional systems , which includes the short - range @xmath1 ising model , the @xmath2 model , etc .    how does theory cope with the exceptions from the broad rule ?",
    "proofs of the van hove type are in essence proofs of analyticity . in principle",
    "they can be extended , refined and thus provide sharper criteria for the _ absence _ of a phase transition@xcite . nonetheless , it is not straightforward to make a positive statement about a system where a phase transition actually occurs . on the other hand ,",
    "landau s approach turns out to be more potent , because it can be inverted to describe the exact pathology which is necessary to produce macroscopic phase coexistence . instead of setting out to prove that a finite interface energy will lead to a macroscopic number of domains because of the entropic gain invoved , it is possible to look at a single , possibly pathological interface , or domain wall ( dw ) , and examine under which conditions the entropic gain might lead to its spontaneous formation .",
    "the question at hand is whether the conditions for spontaneous formation of a single interface are the same as those for a thermodynamic instability of the low - temperature phase , or , equivalently , for macroscopic phase coexistence .",
    "if the conditions are the same , i.e. if ( i ) spontaneous dw formation occurs at some temperature @xmath3 , ( ii ) a macroscopic instability / phase transition is known by independent means to occur at a temperature @xmath4 , and ( iii ) @xmath5 , then it is not unreasonable to argue that the transition is driven by the formation of the dw .    in this paper",
    "i will review how this can be done in two representative cases : ( a ) models of one - dimensional thermodynamic instabilities ( interfacial wetting , dna denaturation ) , ( b ) the @xmath1 ferromagnetic ising model with inverse - square interaction .",
    "case ( a ) will be illustrated by the peyrard - bishop @xcite hamiltonian ( continuum and discrete ) - although this should be regarded as representative of a much broader class of on - site potentials with a repulsive core , a stable minimum and a flat top .",
    "a proper understanding of how dw formation governs one - dimensional phase transitions includes a discussion of symmetric on - site potentials , where the pathology is accidentally lifted and a phase transition does not occur . in a sense this represents a special case of ( a ) and will be treated accordingly .",
    "case ( b ) has been recognized for a long time as a key representative of marginal pathology ; in particular , thouless @xcite has used a landau - type of argument to predict the occurrence of long - range order at low temperatures ; his argument however does not lead to an estimate of the critical temperature .",
    "it turns out that a literal application of the single - dw criterion ( spontaneous dw formation ) , which has been successful in the case of thermodynamic instabilities , yields an estimate of the critical temperature which agrees with state - of - the - art monte carlo calculations@xcite .",
    "this simple result is apparently new ; it motivates the question stated in the title of the paper . in view of the pivotal role played by serge aubry in making our community aware of the relevance of nonlinear excitations ( domain walls , solitons etc . ) to statics and dynamics of phase transitions @xcite , i believe this is a most appropriate place to discuss it .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii briefly restates the original landau argument and a variant which will be useful here .",
    "the next two sections deal with cases ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "conclusions are summarized and discussed in the final section .",
    "given a bistable system with @xmath6 sites and an interface energy @xmath7 separating phases @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the number of interfaces @xmath10 is such as to minimize the total free energy @xmath11 where @xmath12 \\approx \\ln \\left (   \\frac{ne}{m } \\right )   \\label{eq : lans}\\ ] ] is the entropy ; the second expression in ( [ eq : lans ] ) involves use of stirling s formula .",
    "minimization of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath10 yields the most probable value of @xmath10 @xmath14 at any @xmath15 the system breaks up into a macroscopic number of domains ; in other words , phase coexistence can not occur at a macroscopic scale .",
    "an obvious way to circumvent the prohibition ( [ eq : lanm ] ) is an interface ( domain wall ( dw ) ) energy which grows logarithmically with the system size .",
    "if @xmath16 , the number of domains is macroscopic only for @xmath17 . at @xmath18 macroscopic phase coexistence",
    "can occur .",
    "unfortunately , such a dependence of @xmath7 on @xmath6 is usually accompanied by edge effects , i.e. the energy of the dw is no more independent of its position . in order to deal with such cases , it is more convenient to focus on a single dw , situated at position @xmath19 , and examine its thermal properties .",
    "the dw partition function is given by @xmath20 i will make explicit use of this in the context of case ( b ) below .",
    "for the moment , note that this formulation recovers the original landau result if @xmath21 ; in that case @xmath22 , and the dw free energy is @xmath23 it follows directly from ( [ eq : dwfeu ] ) that a dw will form spontaneously at a temperature @xmath24 , i.e. , as long as @xmath7 is finite , no phase coexistence at any nonzero temperature is possible in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "moreover , if @xmath16 , the dw free energy will vanish - and phase coexistence can occur - at @xmath25 , just as predicted by ( [ eq : lanm ] ) .",
    "the vanishing of the dw free energy at a nonzero temperature provides an alternative , positive criterion for phase coexistence .",

    "this scenario does not hold for the morse potential - or any other potential of its class ( cf . above ) - which leads to a non - hilbert - schmidt kernel @xcite .",

    "if the coupling constant is small , @xmath43 , the harmonic coupling in ( [ eq : pbham ] ) is strong .",
    "it is possible to make a continuum aproximation @xmath44 . to leading order ,",
    "this procedure in effect approximates the integral equation ( [ eq : ti ] ) by the schroedinger - like equation @xmath45 \\phi _ { \\nu } ( y )   =    \\epsilon _ { \\nu } \\phi _ { \\nu } ( y ) \\quad .",

    "these solutions have the property that they vanish as @xmath52 and become linearly unbounded as @xmath53 .",
    "they can be regarded as interpolations from the bound to the unbound phase , i.e. they represent _ bona fide _ dws . for any given transverse displacement of the boundary atom @xmath54 , @xmath55 ,",
    "the excess energy of the dw , compared to the minimum of the morse potential , is equal to @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the number of unbound sites ( not necessarily an integer , but this is not important for the present argument in the continuum limit ) .",

    "the dw excess free energy , @xmath59 \\nu \\label{eq : fmorsedw}\\ ] ] vanishes at @xmath60 , i.e. at the critical temperature ( [ eq : tcr ] ) .",
    "the above argument has been generalized @xcite for dws of the highly discrete ( @xmath61 ) version of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : pbham ] ) ; the numerical agreement between @xmath3 and @xmath48 is better than @xmath62 .",
    "it is well known that schroedinger - like equations of the type ( [ eq : tischr ] ) with symmetric on - site potentials which are bounded from above will support bound states for any value of the control parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the average value of the displacement @xmath63 vanishes identically , since the ground state is of even parity .",
    "the system remains bound at all temperatures .",
    "the dw picture provides a straightforward explanation why such an on - site potential can not generate a phase transition : in addition to the dw solutions ( [ eq : dweq ] ) interpolating from the stable minimum to @xmath64 , there is a symmetric pair of solutions interpolating from the stable minimum to @xmath65 .",
    "thus , although a particular dw solution can become entropically stable , an open system will always have an equal chance of creating the symmetric dw ; the average displacement will vanish at all temperatures .",
