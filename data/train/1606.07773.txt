    "it is well known that discrete symmetries , such as charge inversion ( c ) , parity ( p ) and time reversal ( t ) , are useful in understanding elementary particle interactions . these symmetries are preserved in strong and electromagnetic processes  @xcite , but violated in weak interactions as it has been proved since the discovery of cp violation in neutral kaon decays in 1964  @xcite .",
    "the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak physics is an su(2)@xmath2 u(1)@xmath3 gauge theory coupled to quarks , leptons and one complex hypercharge - one , su(2)@xmath4 doublet of scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "as it is known in the sm there are three quark families , as first proposed in the theory of cp violation by m. kobayashi and t. maskawa  @xcite , based on phases in the coupling constants describing the weak charge - changing transitions of quarks , cp - violating effects arise when there are at least three quark families . for three quark families these couplings are described by the unitary @xmath5 cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix  @xcite . with three quark families , one can not make a phase redefinition of quarks so that all the couplings are real . to return to the ckm matrix",
    ", we have that a unitary @xmath6 matrix can be parameterized with three mixing angles @xmath7 and one cp violating phase @xmath8 in the standard parameterization as suggested by m. kobayashi and t. maskawa  @xcite ; with @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath8 is the phase responsible for all cp - violating phenomena in flavor - changing processes in the sm .",
    "the angles @xmath7 can be chosen to lie in the first quadrant , so @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the unitarity of the ckm matrix , @xmath13 , is the modern way to search for physics beyond the sm . in case of this requirement",
    "is violated , it is an indication of the existence of a fourth quark family .",
    "the origin of magnitudes and phases in the ckm matrix is intimately connected with the origin of the quark masses themselves and family replication , in the sm ; the physics for the quark masses is related to the yukawa interactions and the higgs mechanism . in the basis where the sm lagrangian is gauge invariant , the charged currents are diagonal and after the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) the quarks , leptons , higgs fields and gauge bosons acquire mass , but the mass matrices are not diagonal .",
    "rotating the up and down quark mass matrices to its diagonal form , rotates and mixes the quark fields , and we obtain the corresponding mass eigenvalues ; in this basis the charged currents are not diagonal , we obtain the ckm matrix instead .",
    "lee noticed that cp violation effects may arise after the ewsb in a model with more than one higgs .",
    "one should keep in mind , in particular , the possibility that there may be a close link between the higgs sector and cp violation , and one should be open to the possible appearance of su(2 ) higgs doublets of non - standard representations such as singlets and doublets under a flavor symmetry group .",
    "revealing in this way that the full details of the underlying mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking may be considerably more complex than in the standard model .    in the sm due to the form of the scalar potential ,",
    "one component of the complex scalar field acquires a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , and the su(2)@xmath2 u(1)@xmath3 electroweak symmetry is spontaneously broken down to the u(1)@xmath14 gauge symmetry of electromagnetism .",
    "hermiticity of the lagrangian requires real sm scalar potential parameter , and the bosonic sector of the electroweak theory is cp - conserving .",
    "as we know , the sm with only one higgs , provides an extremely successful description of the observed electroweak phenomena . nevertheless , there are a number of motivations to extend the higgs sector of this model by adding a second and third complex su(2 ) doublet of scalar fields .",
    "the theoretical structure of the standard model is constrained by the flavor group @xmath0 ( @xmath0sm ) .",
    "this model contains three - higgs doublet fields , leading to numerous relations among higgs masses and couplings .",
    "in particular , as in the case of the sm , in the normal minimum the tree - level @xmath0sm higgs sector is cp - conserving  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0sm lagrangian contains twelve real scalar fields .",
    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , three goldstone bosons ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) are removed from the spectrum and provide the longitudinal modes of the massive @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "nine physical higgs particles remain : two charged higgs pairs ( @xmath19 ) and five neutral higgs . if experimental data reveals the existence of a higgs sector beyond that of the sm , it will be crucial to test whether the observed scalar spectrum is consistent with an @xmath0sm interpretation .    in order to be general within this framework , one should allow for cp - violating arising from @xmath0sm when confronting the data .",
    "any observed relations among the @xmath0sm parameters would surely contribute to the search for a deeper theoretical understanding of the origin of cp arising from the electroweak symmetry breaking .    in this work",
    "we perform a detailed study of the spontaneous cp breaking conditions of @xmath0sm .",
    "this model has been previously used to calculate the higgs masses spectrum and mixings as well as trilinear higgs self - couplings  @xcite , quark and lepton mixing  @xcite , and flavour changing neutral currents ( fcnc )  @xcite with success .",
    "the model has three @xmath0 flavoured higgs fields , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath1 , which upon acquiring vev s break the electroweak symmetry . here",
    ", we examine the cp breaking minimization conditions , without explicitly breaking the flavour symmetry , although it might be spontaneously broken .",
    "@xmath0sm has tree different stationary points , which can be classified as normal , charge breaking ( cb ) and charge parity breaking ( cpb ) minima , according to the vacuum expectation value of the three higgs fields  @xcite .",
    "we describe the cpb scenarios of the model and give expressions for the higgs mass matrix in one cpb scenario .",
    "a numerical computation of the trilinear self - couplings @xmath22 allows us to find out @xmath23 , which is the higgs candidate like to the sm one .",
    "in writing the higgs potential , we have implicitly chosen a basis in the three - dimensional flavor space of scalar fields .",
    "after ewsb , in the cp minimum , the @xmath0sm scalar potential depends on real parameters and six higgs vev s , for a total of sixteen degrees of freedom .",
    "the @xmath0sm is governed by the choice of the higgs potential and the yukawa couplings of the three scalar to the three generations of quarks and leptons . in the gauge basis @xmath24 , @xmath25 and",

    "<S> we present how the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking , coming from three @xmath0 higgs fields , gives an interesting scenario with nine physical higgs and three goldstone bosons , when spontaneous cp violation arises from the higgs field @xmath0 singlet @xmath1 .    </S>",
