    "a cap @xmath10 in @xmath0 is a set of points no three of which are collinear .",
    "a cap @xmath10 is complete if it is not contained in a larger cap or , equivalently , if every point of @xmath11 is collinear with two points of @xmath10 .",
    "caps in @xmath12 are also called arcs and they have been widely studied by many authors in the past decades . in particular , we refer to the surveys and the results in the works @xcite ( see also the references therein ) for the known constructions and bounds on the size of complete arcs in projective planes . if @xmath13 only few constructions and bounds are known .",
    "caps and in particular arcs have been intensively studied for their connection with coding theory . a linear @xmath3-ary code with length @xmath14 , dimension @xmath15 , and minimum distance  @xmath16",
    "is denoted by @xmath17_{q}$ ] .",
    "if a parity - check matrix of a linear @xmath3-ary code is obtained by taking as columns the homogeneous coordinates of the points of a cap in @xmath0 , then the code has minimum distance @xmath18 ( with the exceptions of the complete 5-cap in @xmath19 giving rise to the @xmath20_{2}$ ] code and the complete 11-cap in @xmath21 corresponding to the golay @xmath22_{3}$ ] code ) .",
    "in particular , complete caps of size @xmath14 in @xmath0 correspond to non - extendable @xmath23_{q}$ ] codes . in the case",
    "@xmath24 these codes are mds , that is they attain the singleton bound , whereas if @xmath1 they are almost mds , since their singleton defect is equal to @xmath25",
    ".    another important parameter concerning linear codes is the covering radius .",
    "the covering radius of an @xmath17_{q}$ ] code @xmath26 is the minimum integer @xmath27 such that any vector of @xmath28 has distance at most @xmath29 from @xmath26 .",
    "complete caps correspond to quasi - perfect linear codes , that is codes with @xmath30 , since they have minimum distance @xmath18 and covering radius @xmath31 ; see also @xcite .",
    "the covering density @xmath32 , introduced in @xcite , is one of the parameters characterizing the covering quality of an @xmath33$]-code @xmath26 and it is defined by @xmath34    note also that caps are connected with quantum codes ; see e.g. @xcite .    in general ,",
    "a central problem concerning caps is to determine the spectrum of the possible sizes of complete caps in a given space ; see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "of particular interest for applications to coding theory is the lower part of the spectrum ; in fact , small complete caps in projective galois spaces correspond to quasi - perfect linear codes with minimum distance 4 and small density ; see for example @xcite .",
    "let @xmath5 be _ the minimum size of a complete cap in @xmath0_.    the exact values of @xmath5 are known only for small @xmath3 . for instance , @xmath35 is known only for @xmath36 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "whereas the trivial lower bound for @xmath5 is @xmath37 , general constructions of complete caps whose size is close to this lower bound are only known for @xmath3 even ; see @xcite . according to the survey paper @xcite , the smallest known complete caps in @xmath38 , with @xmath3 arbitrary large , have size approximately @xmath39 and",

    "computer assisted results on small complete caps in @xmath0 and @xmath42 are given in @xcite . here and further , @xmath42 is the @xmath8-dimensional affine space over the field @xmath9 .    in this paper",
    "we obtain by computer searches results concerning _ upper bounds _ on the functions @xmath35 and @xmath43 .",
    "these searches requested a huge amount of memory and execution time .",
    "in particular , we constructed small complete caps in @xmath38 and @xmath44 using two different approaches : the algorithm with fixed order of points ( fop ) , for @xmath45 in @xmath38 and @xmath46 in @xmath44 , and randomized greedy algorithms , for @xmath47 in @xmath38 and @xmath48 in @xmath44 , where @xmath49    note that such relatively wide regions of @xmath3 values are not considered in literature for @xmath38 and @xmath44 .    using the data obtained by the computer searches we present different functions which approximate the values @xmath35 and @xmath43 , as done in @xcite for the minimum size of complete arcs in projective planes @xmath12 .",

    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ algorithms ] , we describe the main features of the algorithms used in our searches . in section",
    "[ types of bounds ] , some types of upper bounds on @xmath5 are discussed . in section [ sec_content ] , we shortly give the content of tables collecting sizes of small complete caps obtained with the help of the algorithms of section [ algorithms ] ( the tables are placed in appendix ) . in sections",
    "[ pg3q ] and [ pg4q ] , we analyze the results presented in the tables and illustrated the analysis by graphics . in section [ sect_conclus ] , we do some conclusions from the present work .    some results of this paper were briefly presented in @xcite .",
    "in this section we describe two different algorithms used to construct small complete caps in @xmath38 and @xmath44 .",
    "first of all note that the number of points of @xmath0 is of order @xmath62 and for instance , if @xmath63 then @xmath64 : this represents a strong constraint for any algorithm which investigates subsets of points in projective spaces .      this algorithm is a particular type of random algorithm .",
    "some variants of the algorithm fop for @xmath12 and @xmath38 are given in @xcite . in this work",
    "we describe the algorithm fop for the arbitrary space @xmath0 .",
    "firstly we fix a particular order on the points of @xmath0 .",
    "the algorithm builds a complete cap step by step adding a new point at each step , until a complete cap is obtained .",
    "let @xmath65 be the cap obtained at the @xmath66-th step . among the points not lying on bisecants of @xmath65 , the first point in the fixed order",
    "is added to @xmath65 to obtain @xmath67 .",
    "suppose that the points of @xmath0 are ordered as @xmath68 .",
    "consider the empty set as root of the search and let @xmath69 be the partial solution obtained in the @xmath70-th step , as extension of the root .",
    "we put @xmath71\\notag\\\\ & m(j)=\\min \\big\\ { i \\in \\left[m(j-1)+1,\\frac{q^{n+1}-1}{q-1}\\right]\\ : \\big| \\ : \\nexists \\;p , q \\in k^{(j ) }   : \\ ,",
    "a_{i},p , q \\textrm { are collinear}\\big\\},\\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] i.e. @xmath72 is the minimum subscript @xmath73 such that the corresponding point @xmath74 does not lie on a bisecant of @xmath69 .",
    "the process ends when a complete cap is obtained , that is no other points can be added .",
    "we decided to choose a particular order on the points of @xmath0 .",
    "for seek of simplicity , we considered only @xmath3 prime .",
    "let the elements of the field @xmath75 be treated as integers modulo @xmath3 .",
    "let the points @xmath74 of @xmath0 be represented in homogenous coordinates so that @xmath76 where the leftmost non - zero element is 1 .",
    "the points of @xmath0 are sorted according to the lexicographic order on the @xmath77-tuples of their coordinates .",
    "this order is called a _ lexicographical order of points_. we call _ lexicap _ a cap obtained by the algorithm fop with the lexicographical order of points .",
    "we denote by @xmath78 the size of a complete lexicap in @xmath0 .",
    "it is important that for such a lexicographical order for prime @xmath3 , _ the size @xmath78 of a complete lexicap and its set of points depend on @xmath8 and @xmath3 only . _    from a geometrical point of view",
    "the lexicographical order of points is a random order .",
    "clearly , different orders on the points of @xmath0 can determine different size of the complete cap obtained by the algorithm .",
    "due to our experiences in similar types of search ( see @xcite ) we can conjecture that the choice of the order determines only a small perturbation on the size of the complete caps obtained .",
    "for instance , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "11 ) , sizes of complete arcs in @xmath12 obtained by the algorithm fop with the lexicographical and the so - called singer orders of points are compared .",
    "the percentage difference between the sizes is approximately in the interval [ -4% , + 4% ] for @xmath79 .",
    "connections of the algorithm fop with algorithms of coding theory are noted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.1 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 2.1 ) .      a different approach can be used to obtain small complete caps in @xmath0 . in general , small complete caps in @xmath0 obtained using randomized greedy algorithms have size smaller than those obtained with programs of type fop as described in the previous subsection ; see @xcite .",
    "the main difference between the two types of algorithm is that at every step a randomized greedy algorithm maximizes an objective function @xmath80 and only some steps are executed in a random manner .",
    "the number of these steps , their ordinal numbers , and some other parameters of the algorithm have been taken intuitively .",
    "also , if the same maximum of @xmath80 can be obtained in distinct ways , one way is chosen randomly .",
    "we start constructing a complete cap by using a starting point set @xmath81 . in the @xmath73-th step one point",
    "is added to the set @xmath82 and we obtain a point set @xmath83 . as the value of the objective function @xmath80 we consider the number of covered points in @xmath84 that is , points that lie on bisecants of @xmath83 .    on every random @xmath73-th step we take",
    "@xmath85 randomly chosen points of@xmath0 not covered by @xmath86 and compute the objective function @xmath80 adding each of these @xmath87 points to @xmath82 .",
    "the point providing the maximum of @xmath80 is included into  @xmath88 on every non - random @xmath70-th step we consider all points not covered by @xmath89 and add to @xmath89 the point providing the maximum of @xmath90    as @xmath91 we can use a subset of points of an arc obtained in previous stages of the search .",
    "a generator of random numbers is used for random choices . to obtain caps with distinct sizes , starting conditions of the generator",
    "are changed for the same set @xmath91 . in this way",
    "the algorithm works in a convenient limited region of the search space to obtain examples improving the size of the cap from which the fixed points have been taken .    in order to obtain arcs with new sizes ,",
    "sufficiently many attempts should be made with randomized greedy algorithms .",
    "`` predicted '' sizes could be useful for understanding if a good result has been obtained .",
    "if the result is not close to the predicted size , the attempts are continued .",
    "we obtain small complete caps in @xmath0 in two stages .    at the 1-st stage , we take the frame as @xmath91 and create a starting complete cap @xmath92 using in the beginning of the process @xmath93 random steps with distinct @xmath94 all the subsequent steps are non - random .    at the 2-nd stage",
    "we execute @xmath95 attempts to get a complete cap . for every attempt ,",
    "the starting conditions of the random generator are different from the previous ones , whereas the set @xmath91 is the same .",
    "two or three among the first five steps of every attempt are random , the rest of them are non - random .",
    "the values @xmath96 , @xmath93 , and @xmath95 are given intuitively depending on @xmath3 and ( for @xmath97 on @xmath98 and on the stage of the process .",
    "of course , cpu performance affects the algorithm parameters choice .",
    "cap sizes obtained by the randomized greedy algorithms depend on many factors , but in general the results are better than the ones obtained by the algorithm fop .",
    "unfortunately , this approach requires a huge amount of execution time and therefore this type of search has been executed only for a relatively small region of values of @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath5 be the size of the smallest complete cap in @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we propose different types of bounds for these values , generalizing the approach proposed for estimates on @xmath99 in @xcite .",
    "also , let @xmath100 denote the smallest size of a complete cap in @xmath0 obtained using greedy algorithms .",
    "finally , remind that @xmath78 is the size of the complete lexicap in @xmath0 obtained by the algorithm fop with the lexicographical order of points .",
    "let @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and @xmath103 be some functions of @xmath3 defined as follows : @xmath104    from we obtain @xmath105 \\\\",

    "a. _ upper bounds with the constant multiplier @xmath52_. for this type , we consider upper bounds on @xmath101 equal to a value dependent on @xmath8 but independent of @xmath3 .",
    "b. _ upper bounds with a decreasing multiplier @xmath54_. for this type , we find upper bounds on @xmath101 as a decreasing function of @xmath3 denoted by @xmath110 .",
    "this function looks like @xmath111 where @xmath112 is a value dependent on @xmath8 but independent of @xmath3 , whereas @xmath113 are constants independent of @xmath8 and @xmath3 .",

    "the sizes @xmath133 depend not only on @xmath3 and @xmath8 but also on parameters @xmath96 , @xmath93 , @xmath95 of greedy algorithms , see section [ subsection : randomizedgreedyalgorithms ] .",
    "these parameters are not always chosen optimal due to restrictions of the computer time .    at the same time , the sizes @xmath149 depend on @xmath3 and @xmath8 only .",
    "therefore the behavior of the curves @xmath103 obtained from @xmath149 allows to understand the order of value and effectively estimate the smallest sizes @xmath175 of complete caps for @xmath4 in the considered regions of @xmath3 , see figures [ fig_3q4q_3 ] , [ fig_3q4q_4 ]",
    ".    moreover , the decreasing trend of the curves @xmath103 , see figures [ fig_3q4q_3 ] , [ fig_3q4q_4 ] , allow us to conjecture that the upper bounds on @xmath35 and @xmath43 we obtained , especially the bounds with constant multiplier @xmath52 , hold for any @xmath3 prime power .",
