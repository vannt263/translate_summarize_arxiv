    "hierarchical cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology has been largely successful in establishing the paradigm of structure formation and evolution on spatial scales of @xmath8  kpc , corresponding to individual halos , and beyond ( e.g. , cole et al . 2000 ; steinmetz & navarro 2002 ; spergel et al .",
    "however , on smaller scales , a number of fundamental issues related to the origin of luminous galactic components and their structural parameters remain unresolved because of our limited understanding of dynamical processes , such as mass and angular momentum redistribution , star formation ( sf ) and the energy and momentum feedback from the stellar evolution onto the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "specifically , no concensus exists at present on formation of galactic disks , bulges , bars and supermassive black holes ( sbhs , e.g. , white & rees 1978 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ; white 1996 ; ellis 2000 ) . because these structures are made from the baryonic matter",

    "we investigate how various dissipative processes , including the sf and the feedback from stellar evolution onto the ism , affect the galactic disk and bulge formation and evolution . for this purpose",
    "we follow a monolithic collapse of an initial perturbation in the dm and baryons within the hubble flow .",
    "when exactly did the disks and other structural elements of disk galaxies , like bulges , bars and central sbhs , assemble ?",
    "how much evolution has occured since ? both orbital and ground - based telescopes have began to tighten the constraints on these issues , but essential details still missing and controversies are abound .",
    "first , within the hierarchical merging scenario , the so - called ` angular momentum catastrophe '  the angular momentum ( @xmath0 ) distribution of the collapsing baryonic matter does not match that of the observed disks in nearby universe ( e.g. , sommer - larsen , gotz & portinari 2002 ; maller & dekel 2002 ; van den bosch 2002b ; burkert & donghia 2004 ) .",
    "this distribution is characterized by low and high @xmath0 tails which result both in the over - extended disks and very massive bulges .",
    "in addition , gravitational torques between the collapsing baryons and the dm halos lead to disks with radial scalelengths substantially smaller than those observed . under the assumption of @xmath0 conservation during the collapse ,",
    "the specific @xmath0 generated by the random work in the expanding universe is too small to explain the formation of bulgeless disks in the late type galaxies ( van den bosch , burkert & swaters 2001 ; van den bosch 2002a ) .",
    "the second issue is that of the ` core catastrophe ' ( e.g. , moore et al .",
    "1999 ) and relates to the dm central density distribution .",
    "the numerical simulations of dm halo formation have shown that these attain a universal density profile which can be nicely fitted by a two - parameter family ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 , hereafter nfw ) .",
    "however , observations of disk galaxies and galaxy clusters indicate that the dm halos have flat density cores rather than nfw cusps ( e.g. , flores & primack 1994 ; moore 1994 ; burkert 1995 ; kravtsov et al . 1998 ; salucci & burkert 2000 ; boriello & salucci 2001 ; de blok & bosma 2002 ; sand et al .",
    "the standard picture of slow adiabatic collapse of a smooth baryonic component in the centers of such halos can only lead to a larger central concentration , making matters worse .",
    "el - zant , shlosman & hoffman ( 2001 ) and el - zant et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have shown that a flattening of the central density cusps can be a natural outcome of energy deposition by the accreted clumpy baryons via a dynamical friction both in galaxies and in clusters of galaxies .",
    "alternatively , weinberg & katz ( 2002 ) and holley - bockelmann , weinberg , katz ( 2005 ) have claimed that the cusps can be leveled through the action of the stellar bars , but this was strongly disputed by sellwood ( 2003 ) and mcmillan & dehnen ( 2005 ) .",
    "third , abraham et al . (",
    "1999 ) and van den bergh et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have claimed that the fraction of stellar bars sharply decreases above the redshifts of @xmath12 , while the analysis of gems survey ( rix et al .",

    "the initial conditions have been produced by means of the constrained realizations algorithm of hoffman & ribak ( 1991 ) .",
    "the halo prolateness was found to be washed out within the disk radius , and the halo flatness to decrease substantially .",

    "these clumps spiral in to the galactic center and merge there to produce a strong starburst , as also shown by shlosman & noguchi ( 1993 ) , leaving a central object which resembles a classical bulge .",
    "the disk growth was simulated in a fixed spherically - symmetric external potential of the dm halo by adding the gas directly to the disk .",
    "alternatively , samland & gerhard ( 2003 ) have modeled a disk and the associated dm halo growth by adopting the mass inflow rate from _ separate _ cosmological simulations , while preserving the spherical symmetry of the halo , using a chemo - dynamical code .",
    "a number of issues have been investigated , among them the stellar population of the bulge .",
    "a possibility of forming bars from baryonic spheroids immersed in triaxial dm halos was considered by gadotti & de souza ( 2003 ; see also el - zant et al .",

    "sommer - larsen , gtz & portinari ( 2003 ) analyzed the formation history of two galaxies with circular velocities comparable to the milky way ( mw ) and found gas accretion rates , and hence x - ray halo luminosities , at @xmath13 , 67 times larger than at @xmath6 for these objects .",
    "more generally , it is found that the gas infall rates onto these disks are nearly exponentially declining with time , both for the total disk and for the `` solar cylinder . ''",

    "an extended stellar disk forms inside the mw - sized halo immediately after the first merger .",
    "the combination of the uv background and supernova ( sn ) feedback drastically reduces the number of visible satellites orbiting within this halo , bringing it in a fair agreement with observations .",

( 2007a ) , examining the possibility that high @xmath23 elements - to - iron abundance ratios detected in the thick - disk component of the milky way can be explained by sf during the gas - rich mergers .",
    "all the above studies have brought a very useful insight into the formation of disk galaxies and have contributed to a better understanding of specific aspects of the problem . yet , as already mentioned , the problem is very complex and much more remains to be investigated , in particular regarding the dynamics of forming disks , the interaction between the various morphological components and subcomponents , as well as their origin and properties .",

    "we also performed a relatively large number of simulations , so as to gain insight on how the sf and energy feedback affect the structural properties of the galaxy components and subcomponents .",
    "we use cosmological initial conditions and follow the hubble expansion and the subsequent collapse of a single perturbation in the gas and the dm in order to analyze the role of different processes in the formation of disk and bulge components .",

    "the numerical simulations have been performed with an updated version of the ftm-4.4 hybrid code which evolves the collisionless ( @xmath22-body ) and gaseous ( smooth particle hydrodynamics , sph ) components ( heller & shlosman 1994 ; heller 1995 ) , with @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , a number of models have been evolved using the parallel version , ftm-4.5 , of the code .",
    "the gravitational forces were computed using the public version of the routine falcon ( dehnen 2002 ) , which is about ten times faster than optimally coded barnes & hut ( 1986 ) tree code .",
    "the tolerance parameter @xmath26 is fixed at 0.55 .",
    "the energy equation describing the internal state of the sph particles have been used to evolve a multiphase ism by calculating its heating and cooling rates and iterating for the temperature .",
    "star formation was used to convert sph particles into collisionless particles which exert an energy feedback onto the surrounding gas .",
    "the gravitational softening for the collisionless dm and stellar particles is @xmath27  pc , except for two models specified in table  1 . for the sph particles we use two options to soften the gravity",
    " constant softening of @xmath28  pc or 250  pc , and a dynamic softening ( heller & shlosman 1994 ) with the minimum of @xmath29  pc .",
    "a large number of tests has been performed to check the sensitivity of the results to the algorithm and its parameters .",
    "a typical run with the dm only conserved the energy to within 1% and @xmath0 to within 0.1% .",
    "we anticipate that the sf processes and the associated feedback from stellar evolution coupled with an overall dissipative and collisionless dynamics within the forming galaxy determine its evolutionary path .",
    "strictly speaking , because the smallest spatial scales resolved here are substantially larger than scales which are relevant for an ` individual ' sf event , the underlying collapse should be treated witin the context of the two - fluid jeans instability ( zeldovich & novikov 1975 ) in a sheared medium .",
    "we adopt the modified prescription for the sf from heller & shlosman ( 1994 ) that required the gas to be jeans unstable and subject to the feedback from ob stellar winds and supernovae ( sn ) , and introduced a number of statistical elements .",
    "our main assumption is that the sf takes place in regions which are contracting , i.e. , @xmath30 and are jeans unstable , i.e. , @xmath31 which assures that the collapse would continue unhindered down to the smallest resolved spatial scales . under this condition",
    ", the pressure gradients ( which are established over the sound crossing time @xmath32 ) will not be able to build up during the collapse time @xmath33 .",

    "( 2 ) , which , for simplicity , can be replaced by @xmath35 for temperatures in excess of @xmath36  k ( e.g. , navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "this happens because the cooling function @xmath37 has a minimum at @xmath38  k.    for larger densities than @xmath39 , the short cooling time @xmath40 will be guaranteed if the neutral ( cold ) gas will be at least moderately self - gravitating in the background density @xmath41 , @xmath42 here @xmath43 corresponds for the neutral gas ( i.e. , hi and hei ) , and @xmath44 combines the mass of the ionized ( hot ) gas , stars and dm , with @xmath45 being the fudge factor . for the standard model , @xmath46 ( see table  1 ) .",

    "the quantity @xmath62 is not allowed to be less than unity , in which case we set @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and the gas particle is removed from the simulation .",

    "the largest bulge is found in models with the smallest @xmath7 , among the triplet and doublet parameter sequences given above , i.e. , in n23 ( fig .  14 ) and n24 .",
    "the smallest bulges are found in n3 , n22 . such a bulge",
    "is also expected in n21 . however , as can be seen in fig .",
    "14 , the bulge of n25 is smaller than that of n21 .",
    "the reason for this behavior lies in that n21 develops a strong late bar , while n25 exhibits only an oval distortion after the first 5  gyr .",
    "n23 lacks a late bar totally .",
    "stellar bars are known to heat up the central disk regions and inflate them vertically by increasing their velocity dispersions , both dynamically and secularly ( e.g. , athanassoula & misiriotis 2002 ; berentzen et al .",
    "additional heating exerted by the bar in n21 contributes to the appearance of a more prominent bulge there .",
    "we infer that two processes , at least , emerge as being responsible for the bulge and stellar bar evolution in our simulations  both of these processes are ` guided ' by @xmath7 , the stellar evolution feedback onto the gas .",
    "we observe that a decrease in @xmath7 alleviates the clumpiness in the gas , which in turn heats up the stellar component in the disk , therefore , delaying or damping the bar instability there .",
    "this explains why n21 bulge does not ` fit ' in the sequence shown in fig .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that by the end of the simulations there is a clear anti - correlation between the bulge prominence and @xmath7 .",
    "we look for the effect of the critical gas density for the sf by comparing n14 ( @xmath217 ) with n27 ( 0.05 ) , and n15 ( 0.5 ) with n16 ( 0.25 ) .",
    "the main difference observed along this sequence is the delayed evolution in n27 , where @xmath3  kpc bar develops much later compared to n3 and n14 , after @xmath196  gyr only .",
    "it can be also seen in the sf colors .",
    "the dominant sf in the central kpc of this model also appears very late , after @xmath171  gyr , and spreads out in @xmath117 and in @xmath11 ( low surface and volume densities in the gas ) .",
    "it picks up , however , after @xmath139  gyr , and remains much higher than in other models .",
    "the stellar disk is clearly much hotter and puffy in n27 .",
    "the bulge develops late but becomes more pronounced than in n14 .",
    "+    on the other hand , using a low value @xmath101 in n27 produces the smallest @xmath218  kpc disk with a very high surface density , enveloped in a low density stellar and gas material ( fig .",
    "the sf is concentrated in the disk mid - plane . a bar - like stellar and gas response to the halo prolateness",
    "is evident initially within the central @xmath3  kpc , but decays after 3  gyr .",
    "this response forms at a fixed , nearly normal angle with the dm major axis .",
    "hence , using a low density threshold for sf , in the presence of a substantial feedback , heats up the stellar and gas components in the growing disk .",
    "n27 is probably the only model where the sf is distributed and is triggered at all radii @xmath219  kpc in the disk  this disk does _ not _ appear to grow from inside out .",
    "it produces a substantial bulge but the smallest stellar disk .",
    "a number of models have a much shorter timescale for sf , @xmath221 instead of 10 ( see table  1 )  we compare n3 ( @xmath222 ) with n14 @xmath223 , n8 ( 10 ) with n16 ( 1 ) , and n17 ( 10 ) with n15 ( 1 ) .",
    "early enough , by @xmath224  gyr , the sf in n14 is less concentrated toward the midplane and the stellar and gas disks are visibly thicker than in n3 .",
    "the sf is also more profound in the n14 bars .",
    "the gas surrounding the disk in n14 is more noticeable , to the extent that the gas disk flares beyond 5  kpc .",
    "by @xmath225  gyr , a 3  kpc disk of higher surface density emerges in n14  while the vertical thickness of the disk is now comparable to n3 , the radial size of n14 disk is smaller . by @xmath226",
    "gyr the bulge of n3 seems more pronounced , while toward the end the n14 bar is more gas - rich than in n3 .",
    "n15 shows earlier and higher rate of sf and has an initial stellar , gas ( and sf ) bar .",
    "this bar weakens and strengthens occasionally but after @xmath139  gyr grows monotonically . for a comparison",
    ", n16 develops such a large - scale bar by 7  gyr .",
    "the disk in n15 is more puffed up than in n17 and the grand - design spiral arms are much less visible .",
    "grand - design spiral structure is strong between @xmath227  gyr  apparently when the bar / disk are aligned at certain angles to the dm halo major axis .",
    "the sf , which delineates the arms , follows them , while it is more diffuse in n17 .",
    "the disk is thick and concave at this time , much more than in n17 .",
    "compact gas clumps are present thereafter . by 3.5  gyr ,",
    "the sf in n15 has subsided more than in n17 , the disk seems to be somewhat smaller and the bulge is more compact as well .",
    "it also has less gas in the central kpc .",
    "the gas layer starts to thin first in this model compared to n17 . towards the end of the simulations it is clear that the disk in n15 is overall thicker , and the bulge is standing out with respect to the face - on disk more than in n17",
    "this bulge has an oval / barlike shape .",
    "overall , models with smaller @xmath220 form somewhat smaller in size but more puffed up stellar disks .      to enforce the halo axial symmetry during a continuous infall of material",
    ", we have randomized the azimuths of 5% dm particles , every timestep .",
    "therefore , no initial bars are either triggered or driven by the halo prolateness .",
    "furthermore , this should lower the ability of the halo particles to be in resonance with the nonaxisymmetric features in the disk .",
    "this , in turn , should decrease the efficiency of angular momentum flow from the disk to the halo and change the stellar bar evolution .",
    "indeed , in model n4 , the initial collapse proceeds without the ` cat s cradle ' phase and no dm filaments are present .",
    "consequently , the gas does not form the massive clumps .",
    "the disk remains nearly axisymmetric at all times and no substantial spiral structure is visible in the outer part , unlike in in all other models .",
    "some stronger oval distortion develops inside 12  kpc after @xmath196  gyr for some time and decays thereafter .",
    "the gas bars are visible from time to time in this region .",
    "this evolution is in a sharp contrast with n3 which displays an early and late bar activity on various spatial scales .",
    "the sf and spiral morphology in n4 also differ substantialy .",
    "+    models n18 and n19 have larger gravitational softening in gas and in stars  @xmath229  pc instead of 150  pc in other models .",
    "we first compare n18 with n3 .",
    "the general evolution of n3 and n18 is similar but it differs in some details .",
    "first , the former model shows sharper features ( shocks , spiral arms , sf regions ) .",
    "second , the gas there is somewhat more clumpy and is able to concentrate more towards the center and the disk mid - plane .",
    "already during the first gyr , n3 gas shows a larger surface density in the central kpc .",
    "third , the bars that form in this model are less strong than in n18 ( figs .  6 , 16 ) .",
    "while the n3 nuclear bar is gas poor ( efficiently channeling it to the center ) , the n18 bar remains gas - rich for a few gyrs .",
    "two factors may reduce the bar strength here : larger gas and stellar concentration to the center and more clumpy gas that scatters bar stars .",
    "this latter feature can also prevent the bar orbits to lock in the resonance with the dm halo orbits , thus resulting in a weaker bar . finally , the stellar bulge in n3 is less prominent than in n18 but is more centrally concentrated .",
    "next , we compare n21 with n19 .",
    "the stellar softening is the same but the gas softening is 150  pc in n21 instead of 250  pc in n19 . as in the previous pair ,",
    "the morphological features are more detailed in n21 .",
    "this is noticeable in the distribution of sf and gas in the strong spiral arms  both are more clumpy , but not in stars .",
    "as before , n21 develops a more massive gas concentration in the center , but the difference between the models is not as obvious , apparently because the stellar components have identical softening .",
    "the nuclear rings appear ( vertically ) thinner in n21 and are much more long - lived . occasionally , they collapse to the center . in the long run ,",
    "the difference emerges also in the stellar distribution as well  the bulge is visibly larger in n19 and less centrally concentrated .",
    "the bars in n19 are also more gas rich , but periodically this property is inverted between the models . on the other hand , the bars in n19 appear stronger .",
    "hence , the gravitational softening emerges as an important parameter which drives the evolution in our models . especially in gas",
    ", this parameter reflects the overall smoothness of the gas and can be related to a number of intrinsic processes in the ism , heating / cooling and the topology of the magnetic fields  those affect the gas clumpiness .",
    "we have simulated the formation of a two - component galactic disk within an assembling dm halo , including the accompanying sf and the stellar feedback onto the ism . for this purpose ,",
    "we have followed the collapse of an isolated cosmological density perturbation with the spin parameter @xmath121 , from its linear regime at @xmath230 and up to @xmath6 .",
    "our approach has several advantages .",
    "we have improved the sf criterion , accounting not only for the contraction and the critical density of the sf region , but also for the background density .",
    "each gaseous particle can make up to four generations of stars , with different metallicities , while an additional parameter allows to consider a delayed collapse of the molecular clouds due to mhd turbulence .",
    "we consider the energy feedback both from stellar winds and from sn , and we are particularly careful in the way this energy is deposited in the gas .    we have employed a reasonably high number of particles , allowing us to resolve a number of important features . in particular , our simulations are fully self - consistent , in order to avoid artifacts that could be introduced , e.g. , by a rigid halo ( e.g. , athanassoula 2002 ) .",
    "this enabled us to study interesting dynamics linked to the halo shape .",
    "we have voluntarily refrained from using a yet higher number of particles , in order to be able to run a large number of simulations , much more than is usual in similar studies . with our @xmath160 models",
    ", we tried to gain insight on how the various parameters , and particularly the sf and the energy feedback , affect the structural properties of the bulge , the disk and its components , like bars and spirals .",
    "of course , the available parameter space is very large and much further work and many more simulations are necessary before any thorough understanding is reached . yet , even with the number of simulations we have at our disposal , several clear trends emerge .    in all models",
    "the disk forms over a period of time of @xmath231  gyr , i.e. , it reaches 50% of its final mass over this time , although its equatorial plane is established very early .",
    "the dm halo develops a characteristic triaxial shape , i.e. , prolate in the plane perpendicular to the original angular momentum , and flattened along the rotation axis . for pure dm models , the axial ratios of the inner ( @xmath232  kpc ) halos lie between @xmath233 and @xmath234 , and of the outer ( @xmath235  kpc ) halos between @xmath236 and @xmath237 . at the same time , we find that the halo figure tumbles very slowly , @xmath238 over the hubble time . _",
    "the dm collapse pumps most of the angular momentum into the internal circulation within the halo , while the baryonic collapse is stopped by the centrifugal barrier in a flat disk .",
    "_ thus the baryons , due to dissipation , collapse much more profoundly .    the halo triaxiality decreases with time during the disk growth .",
    "two processes contribute to this  ( 1 ) the increasing central mass concentration in the model and the appearance of of numerous scattering centers ( blobs ) in the halo , and ( 2 ) the out - of phase response of the baryons in the disk to the halo shape .",
    "the first effect reduces somewhat both the flatness and prolateness of the halo , even in the absence of a baryonic component , much more so in the presence of baryons .",
    "the second effect results from the negligible tumbling of the halo figure  under these circumstances the inner ilr ( if it exists ) and the outer ilr are pushed to the center and to large radii , respectively , and the disk acquires an elongation perpendicular to the major axis of the halo , thus diluting its potential in the equatorial plane .",
    "this effect is model independent and is unrelated to dissipation .",
    "the angular momentum ( @xmath0 ) flow within the evolving models has been always directed outwards  the inner disk is losing @xmath0 to the outer disk and to the surrounding dm halo .",
    "overall , the baryons lose their @xmath0 while the dm increases it in the process of evolution . on the average ,",
    "the dm halo acquires about 2.5%3% of @xmath0 while the baryons lose about 25%30% of their original momentum .",
    "the total @xmath0 is conserved to less than 0.5% even in the models with sf . the specific angular momentum ( @xmath199 )",
    "behaves in a more complicated manner  for the dm it is almost constant over the hubble time . for baryons",
    ", @xmath199 decreases with time but each of the components separately , the gas and stars , increase their @xmath199 substantially over the time .",
    "this happens because the first stars form in the center with a minimal @xmath199 , and the first gas consumed by the sf has small @xmath199 as well .",
    "the disk evolution can be roughly divided into two stages : in the early stage , the baryons flow towards the forming small and amorphous disk along a number of radial string patterns  this characteristic configuration forms in all models and resembles the cat s cradle .",
    "it survives for about 1  gyr .",
    "in the second stage , the disk periodically changes its shape from less to more oval and frequently develops a pair of grand - design spiral arms .",
    "the disk shape and the strength of these arms depends on their relative angle with the major axis of the dm halo . in nearly all models , the disk grows from inside out and is gas - dominated initially .",
    "about 1/3 to 1/2 of the original baryons remains outside the sf region of the disk or in the halo in form of hot gas at the end of the simulation ( see also sommer - larsen 2006 )",
    ".    the star formation ( sf ) is typically strongly concentrated toward the disk midplane .",
    "the gaseous component in the disk is puffed up by the feedback from the stellar evolution .",
    "we find that the gas layer narrows substantially when the sf rate there drops below @xmath4  which typically happens after the first 5  gyr .",
    "the sf delineates various morphological features  like early bars , spiral arms and nuclear rings .",
    "late bars appear gas - poor and do not show much sf .",
    "we find that parameters which characterize the disk morphology fit the observations of galactic disks in the nearby universe , e.g. , their radial and vertical scalelengths , shape parameters , bulge - to - disk ratios , etc .",
    "the typical radial scalelength in the disk increases by a factor of 2 over the hubble time , ending within the range of @xmath239  kpc . during this time the disk grows by more than a factor of 10 in mass .",
    "a caution should be taken when tackling the evolution of a collisionless component ( stars ) within the central few 100  pc , specifically the formation of bulges in disk galaxies .",
    "insufficient timestep resolution can lead to being unable to resolve the orbits of individual stars  this leads to energy non - conservation and overall heating in the region .",
    "such heating has been detected in the central few 100  pc of our models .",
    "it did not affect the large - scale evolution but could , in principle , modify the nuclear bar strength as well as increase the dispersion velocities in the disky component of the bulge .",
    "we , therefore , postpone the discussion of the bulge formation , the bulge - disk decomposition and the evolution of characteristic scalelengths in our models to a separate publication where high - resolution timestep models are presented .    essentially , the disks obtained in our simulations range from being bulge - dominated to nearly bulgeless",
    ". models with larger feedback from the stellar evolution form _ smaller _ bulges and vice versa .",
    "models with shorter timescale for sf formed ` fatter ' disks but not necessary more massive bulges .",
    "moreover , reducing the critical density for sf has led to a distributed sf activity over the inner 15  kpc , as opposed to the inside out disk growth in other models , and to ` fat ' short ( small radial scalelength ) disks .",
    "all models are characterized by an extensive bar - forming activity within the central few kpc .",
    "this is especially true for the initial few gyr of the disk formation .",
    "the early bar axial ratios vary in tandem with the mutual bar - halo orientation .",
    "these bars appear to be gas - rich , channel their gas contents towards the central kpc and weaken substantially over this time . in some cases their strength was observed to revive , even after a prolonged period of time . in other cases , small nuclear bars developed in addition to the primary bars .",
    "dynamically , we find that these nuclear bars either corotate or tumble differently than the large bars .",
    "in all the latter cases , we find that this was preceded by a gas inflow to the region and that nuclear bars tumble substantially faster than their large - scale counterparts .",
    "some of the nuclear bars appear not to have visible stellar components  they quickly collapse to the center .",
    "nuclear rings and spirals appear frequently over the hubble time and the former ones are robust features in the disk .",
    "some models show large inflow rates of the gas into the central few kpc leading to the jeans instability in the gas and the formation of massive clumps .",
    "these clumps experience dynamical friction within the disk and spiral in before being consumed by the sf process .",
    "such a regime has been investigated by shlosman & noguchi ( 1993 ) who found that the bar growth is suppressed due to the disk being heated by the clumps ( see also immeli et al .",
    "2004 ) . here",
    "we confirm that indeed the bars have been substantially weakened by these clumps , or did not form in the extreme cases .",
    "our main results indicate that it is possible to form disks which are in agreement with those in the local universe , e.g. , with observed sizes , scalelengths , shapes , mass distributions , etc .",
    "furthermore , we obtain rotation curves that are flat and with the disk / halo contributions as observed ( e.g. , bosma , 2004 ) . the so - called angular momentum ` catastrophe ' discussed in section  1 is naturally avoided in this approach .",
    "the baryons lose only about 25% of their angular momentum because both the original @xmath0 present and the feedback from the stellar evolution reduce their accretion rate onto the disk where most of the @xmath0 is lost .",
    "we find that in all models the total angular momentum of baryons ( stars@xmath96gas ) within the disk region closely follows that of the dm there .",
    "after the initial @xmath3  gyr , the baryons rapidly lose their @xmath0 that flows to the dm until ` equipartition . '",
    "moreover , a full range of bulge - dominated to nearly bulgeless disks have been obtained as a result of the evolution over the hubble time .",
    "the disks formed in our numerical simulations do not appear to suffer from being too compact and having small radial or large vertical scalelengths .",
    "_ the growth of the disk can not be modeled realiably without resolving its radial scalelength _  an issue which is difficult to address at present in cosmological simulations and which is resolved in our approach . the problem of over - cooling  when the gas radiates away the energy deposited by feedback from the stellar evolution ( ob stellar radiation - driven winds and sn ) , is also addressed here ( see section  2 ) .",
    "bars provide the strongest impetus for an internal evolution in disk galaxies by imposing gravitational torques which trigger the mass and angular momentum redistributions within the central @xmath147  kpc . while prolate dm halos appear to be incompatible with large - scale stellar bars ( el - zant & shlosman 2002 ; berentzen et al .",
    "2006 ) , the growth of disks acts to wash out the equatorial prolateness within , at least , the inner halos ( berentzen & shlosman 2006 ) .",
    "the present work confirms this trend  we observe a decrease in the halo flatness even well outside the disk , and elimination of its prolateness within the inner ( @xmath232  kpc ) halo and reduction in the outer halo . the disk shape and morphology",
    "are affected by the halo shape during the first few gyr  the disks appear oval in contradiction of those observed in the local universe ( e.g. , rix & zaritsky 1995 ) .",
    "the interaction between the ovally - shaped disks and prolate halos provide for the spiral driving which clearly depends on the mutual disk - halo orientations .    in summary",
    ", we have explored different aspects of disk galaxy formation in the framework of the collapse of an isolated density pertubation embedded in the hubble flow .",
    "this allows us to focus on specific processes normally unresolved in the cosmological simulations . on the other hand",
    ", we lose the effect of the substructure on the model .",
    "specifically , we have aimed at understanding the imprint of various feedback parameters describing the star formation on the basic charateristics of the disk - halo system .",
    "one should consider this effort as an exploratory one , which requires a full implementation of realitic initial conditions in tandem with a higher numerical resolution .",
