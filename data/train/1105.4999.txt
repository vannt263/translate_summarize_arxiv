    "energy - constrained wireless networks , such as sensor networks , are typically powered by batteries that have limited operation time .",
    "although replacing or recharging the batteries can prolong the lifetime of the network to a certain extent , it usually incurs high costs and is inconvenient , hazardous ( say , in toxic environments ) , or even impossible ( e.g. , for sensors embedded in building structures or inside human bodies ) .",
    "a more convenient , safer , as well as `` greener '' alternative is thus to harvest energy from the environment , which virtually provides perpetual energy supplies to wireless devices .",
    "in addition to other commonly used energy sources such as solar and wind , ambient radio - frequency ( rf ) signals can be a viable new source for energy scavenging .",
    "it is worth noting that rf - based energy harvesting is typically suitable for low - power applications ( e.g. , sensor networks ) , but also can be applied for scenarios with more substantial power consumptions if dedicated wireless power transmission is implemented .    on the other hand , since rf signals that carry energy can at the same time be used as a vehicle for transporting information , _ simultaneous wireless information and power transfer _ ( swipt ) becomes an interesting new area of research that attracts increasing attention .",
    "although a unified study on this topic is still in the infancy stage , there have been notable results reported in the literature @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "varshney first proposed a _ capacity - energy _ function to characterize the fundamental tradeoffs in simultaneous information and energy transfer .",
    "for the single - antenna or siso ( single - input single - output ) awgn ( additive white gaussian noise ) channel with amplitude - constrained inputs , it was shown in @xcite that there exist nontrivial tradeoffs in maximizing information rate versus ( vs. ) power transfer by optimizing the input distribution . however ,",
    "if the average transmit - power constraint is considered instead , the above two goals can be shown to be aligned for the siso awgn channel with gaussian input signals , and thus there is no nontrivial tradeoff . in @xcite ,",
    "grover and sahai extended @xcite to frequency - selective single - antenna awgn channels with the average power constraint , by showing that a non - trivial tradeoff exists in frequency - domain power allocation for maximal information vs. energy transfer .",
    "as a matter of fact , _ wireless power transfer _ ( wpt ) or in short _ wireless power _ , which generally refers to the transmissions of electrical energy from a power source to one or more electrical loads without any interconnecting wires , has been investigated and implemented with a long history .",
    "generally speaking , wpt is carried out using either the `` near - field '' electromagnetic ( em ) induction ( e.g. , inductive coupling , capacitive coupling ) for short - distance ( say , less than a meter ) applications such as passive radio - frequency identification ( rfid ) @xcite , or the `` far - field '' em radiation in the form of microwaves or lasers for long - range ( up to a few kilometers ) applications such as the transmissions of energy from orbiting solar power satellites to earth or spacecrafts @xcite .",
    "however , prior research on em radiation based wpt , in particular over the rf band , has been pursued independently from that on wireless information transfer ( wit ) or radio communication .",
    "this is non - surprising since these two lines of work in general have very different research goals : wit is to maximize the _ information transmission capacity _ of wireless channels subject to channel impairments such as the fading and receiver noise , while wpt is to maximize the _ energy transmission efficiency _",
    "( defined as the ratio of the energy harvested and stored at the receiver to that consumed by the transmitter ) over a wireless medium .",
    "nevertheless , it is worth noting that the design objectives for wpt and wit systems can be aligned , since given a transmitter energy budget , maximizing the signal power received ( for wpt ) is also beneficial in maximizing the channel capacity ( for wit ) against the receiver noise .",
    "hence , in this paper we attempt to pursue a unified study on wit and wpt for emerging wireless applications with such a dual usage .",
    "an example of such wireless dual networks is envisaged in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model new ] , where a fixed access point ( ap ) coordinates the two - way communications to / from a set of distributed user terminals ( uts ) .",
    "however , unlike the conventional wireless network in which both the ap and uts draw energy from constant power supplies ( by e.g. connecting to the grid or a battery ) , in our model , only the ap is assumed to have a constant power source , while all uts need to replenish energy from the received signals sent by the ap via the far - field rf - based wpt .",
    "consequently , the ap needs to coordinate the wireless information and energy transfer to uts in the downlink , in addition to the information transfer from uts in the uplink .",
    "wireless networks with such a dual information and power transfer feature have not yet been studied in the literature to our best knowledge , although some of their interesting applications have already appeared in , e.g. , the body sensor networks @xcite with the out - body local processing units ( lpus ) powered by battery communicating and at the same time sending wireless power to in - body sensors that have no embedded power supplies . however , how to characterize the fundamental information - energy transmission tradeoff in such dual networks is still an open problem .    in this paper",
    ", we focus our study on the downlink case with simultaneous wit and wpt from the ap to uts . in the generic system model depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model new ] , each ut can in general harvest energy and decode information at the same time ( by e.g. applying the power splitting scheme introduced later in this paper ) .",
    "however , from an implementation viewpoint , one particular design whereby each ut operates as either an information receiver or an energy receiver at any given time may be desirable , which is referred to as _",
    "switching_. this scheme is practically appealing since state - of - the - art wireless information and energy receivers are typically designed to operate separately with very different power sensitivities ( e.g. , @xmath0dbm for information receivers vs. @xmath1dbm for energy receivers ) . as a result , if time switching is employed at each ut jointly with the `` near - far '' based transmission scheduling at the ap , i.e. , uts that are close to the ap and thus receive high power from the ap are scheduled for wet , whereas those that are more distant from the ap and thus receive lower power are scheduled for wit , then swipt systems can be efficiently implemented with existing information and energy receivers and the additional time - switching device at each receiver .",
    "for an initial study on swipt , this paper considers the simplified scenarios with only one or two active uts in the network at any given time . for the case of two uts ,",
    "we assume time switching , i.e. , the two uts take turns to receive energy or ( independent ) information from the ap over different time blocks . as a result ,",
    "when one ut receives information from the ap , the other ut can opportunistically harvest energy from the same signal broadcast by the ap , and vice versa .",
    "hence , at each block , one ut operates as an information decoding ( i d ) receiver , and the other ut as an energy harvesting ( eh ) receiver .",
    "we thus refer to this case as _ separated eh and i d receivers_. on the other hand , for the case with only one single ut to be active at one time ( while all other uts are assumed to be in the off / sleep mode ) , the active ut needs to harvest energy as well as decode information from the same signal sent by the ap , i.e. , the same set of receiving antennas are shared by both eh and i d receivers residing in the same ut .",
    "thus , this case is referred to as _ co - located eh and i d receivers_. surprisingly , as we will show later in this paper , the optimal information - energy tradeoff for the case of co - located receivers is more challenging to characterize than that for the case of separated receivers , due to a potential limitation that practical eh receiver circuits are not yet able to decode the information directly and vice versa .",
    "note that similar to the case of separated receives , time switching can also be applied in the case of co - located receivers to orthogonalize the information and energy transmissions at each receiving antenna ; however , this scheme is in general suboptimal for the achievable rate - energy tradeoffs in the case of co - located receivers , as will be shown later in this paper .",
    "some further assumptions are made in this paper for the purpose of exposition .",
    "firstly , this paper considers a quasi - static fading environment where the wireless channel between the ap and each ut is assumed to be constant over a sufficiently long period of time during which the number of transmitted symbols can be approximately regarded as being infinitely large . under this assumption",
    ", we further assume that it is feasible for each ut to estimate the downlink channel from the ap and then send it back to the ap via the uplink , since the time overhead for such channel estimation and feedback is a negligible portion of the total transmission time due to quasi - static fading .",
    "we will address the more general case of fading channels with imperfect / partial channel knowledge at the transmitter in our future work .",
    "secondly , we assume that the system under our study typically operates at the high signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) regime for the i d receiver in the case of co - located receivers .",
    "this is to be compatible with the high - power operating requirement for the eh receiver of practical interest as previously mentioned .",
    "thirdly , without loss of generality , we assume a multi - antenna or mimo ( multiple - input multiple - output ) system , in which the ap is equipped with multiple antennas , and each ut is equipped with one or more antennas , for enabling both the high - performance wireless energy and information transmissions ( as it is well known that for wit only , mimo systems can achieve folded array / capacity gains over siso systems by spatial beamforming / multiplexing @xcite ) .    under the above assumptions ,",
    "a three - node mimo broadcast system is considered in this paper , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : system model ] , wherein the eh and i d receivers harvest energy and decode information separately from the signal sent by a common transmitter .",
    "note that this system model refers to the case of separated eh and i d receivers in general , but includes the co - located receivers as a special case when the mimo channels from the transmitter to both receivers become identical . assuming this model , the main results of this paper are summarized as follows :    * for the case of",
    "separated eh and i d receivers , we design the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs between maximal information rate vs. energy transfer , which are characterized by the boundary of a so - called _ rate - energy _ ( r - e ) region .",
    "we derive a semi - closed - form expression for the optimal transmit covariance matrix ( for the joint precoding and power allocation ) to achieve different rate - energy pairs on the boundary of the r - e region .",
    "note that the r - e region is a multiuser extension of the single - user capacity - energy function in @xcite .",
    "also note that the multi - antenna broadcast channel ( bc ) has been investigated in e.g. @xcite@xcite for information transfer solely by unicasting or multicasting .",
    "however , mimo - bc for swipt as considered in this paper is new and has not yet been studied by any prior work .",
    "* for the case of co - located eh and i d receivers , we show that the proposed solution for the case of separated receivers is also applicable with the identical mimo channel from the transmitter to both i d and eh receivers . furthermore , we consider a potential practical constraint that eh receiver circuits can not directly decode the information ( i.e. , any information embedded in received signals sent to the eh receiver is lost during the eh process ) . under this constraint , we show that the r - e region with the optimal transmit covariance ( obtained without such a constraint ) in general only serves as a performance outer bound for the co - located receiver case . *",
    "hence , we investigate two practical receiver designs , namely _ time switching _ and _ power splitting _ , for the case of co - located receivers . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : practical schemes ] , for time switching , each receiving antenna periodically switches between the eh receiver and i d receiver , whereas for power splitting , the received signal at each antenna is split into two separate signal streams with different power levels , one sent to the eh receiver and the other to the i d receiver .",
    "note that time switching has also been proposed in @xcite for the siso awgn channel .",
    "furthermore , note that the _ antenna switching _ scheme whereby the receiving antennas are divided into two groups with one group switched to information decoding and the other group to energy harvesting can be regarded as a special case of power splitting with only binary splitting power ratios at each receiving antenna . for these practical receiver designs ,",
    "we derive their achievable r - e regions as compared to the r - e region outer bound , and characterize the conditions under which their performance gaps can be closed .",
    "for example , we show that the power splitting scheme approaches the tradeoff upper bound asymptotically when the rf - band antenna noise at the receiver becomes more dominant over the baseband processing noise ( more details are given in section iv - c ) .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows :",

    "in addition , it is assumed that the transmitter and both receivers operate over the same frequency band . assuming a narrow - band transmission over quasi - static fading channels , the baseband equivalent channels from the transmitter to the eh receiver and i d receiver can be modeled by matrices @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",

    "it is worth noting that the eh receiver does not need to convert the received signal from the rf band to the baseband in order to harvest the carried energy .",
    "nevertheless , thanks to the law of energy conservation , it can be assumed that the total harvested rf - band power ( energy normalized by the baseband symbol period ) , denoted by @xmath42 , from all receiving antennas at the eh receiver is proportional to that of the received baseband signal , i.e. , @xmath43\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a constant that accounts for the loss in the energy transducer for converting the harvested energy to electrical energy to be stored ; for the convenience of analysis , it is assumed that @xmath45 in this paper unless stated otherwise .",

    "note that for simplicity , we assumed in ( [ eq : power ] ) that the harvested energy due to the background noise at the eh receiver is negligible and thus can be ignored .",
    "on the other hand , the baseband transmission from the transmitter to the i d receiver can be modeled by @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the received signal at the @xmath47th symbol interval , and @xmath50 denotes the receiver noise vector .",

    "in addition , we assume that there is an average power constraint at the transmitter across all transmitting antennas denoted by @xmath55=\\mathtt{tr}({\\mbox{\\boldmath{$ s $ } } } ) \\leq p$ ] . in the following ,",
    "we examine the optimal transmit covariance @xmath2 to maximize the transported energy efficiency and information rate to the eh and i d receivers , respectively .",
    "consider first the mimo link from the transmitter to the eh receiver when the i d receiver is not present . in this case , the design objective for @xmath2 is to maximize the power @xmath42 received at the eh receiver .",
    "since from ( [ eq : power ] ) it follows that @xmath56 with @xmath45 , the aforementioned design problem can be formulated as @xmath57 let @xmath58 and the ( reduced ) singular value decomposition ( svd ) of @xmath39 be denoted by @xmath59 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 , each of which consists of orthogonal columns with unit norm , and @xmath62 with @xmath63 .",
    "furthermore , let @xmath64 denote the first column of @xmath65 .",
    "then , we have the following proposition .    [",
    "proposition : opt s eh ] the optimal solution to ( p1 ) is @xmath66 .",
    "see appendix [ appendix : proof opt s eh ] .",
    "given @xmath67 , it follows that the maximum harvested power at the eh receiver is given by @xmath68 .",
    "it is worth noting that since @xmath69 is a rank - one matrix , the maximum harvested power is achieved by _ beamforming _ at the transmitter , which aligns with the strongest eigenmode of the matrix @xmath70 , i.e. , the transmitted signal can be written as @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is an arbitrary random signal over @xmath47 with zero mean and unit variance , and @xmath64 is the transmit beamforming vector . for convenience ,",
    "we name the above transmit beamforming scheme to maximize the efficiency of wpt as `` energy beamforming '' .",
    "next , consider the mimo link from the transmitter to the i d receiver without the presence of any eh receiver . assuming the optimal gaussian codebook at the transmitter ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath73 , the transmit covariance @xmath2 to maximize the transmission rate over this mimo channel can be obtained by solving the following problem @xcite : @xmath74 the optimal solution to the above problem is known to have the following form @xcite : @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is obtained from the ( reduced ) svd of @xmath40 expressed by @xmath77 , with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 with the diagonal elements obtained from the standard `` water - filling ( wf ) '' power allocation solution @xcite : @xmath83 with @xmath84 being the so - called ( constant ) water - level that makes @xmath85 .",
    "the corresponding maximum transmission rate is then given by @xmath86 .",
    "the maximum rate is achieved in general by _ spatial multiplexing _ @xcite over up to @xmath87 spatially decoupled awgn channels , together with the gaussian codebook , i.e. , the transmitted signal can be expressed as @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a gaussian random vector @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 denote the precoding matrix and the ( diagonal ) power allocation matrix , respectively .    [",
    "remark : power rate relationship ] it is worth noting that in problem ( p1 ) , it is assumed that the transmitter sends to the eh receiver continuously .",
    "now suppose that the transmitter only transmits a fraction of the total time denoted by @xmath93 with @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , assume that the transmit power level can be adjusted flexibly provided that the consumed average power is bounded by @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath96 or @xmath97 .",
    "in this case , it can be easily shown that the transmit covariance @xmath98 also achieves the maximum harvested power @xmath68 for any @xmath94 , which suggests that the maximum power delivered is independent of transmission time . however , unlike the case of maximum power transfer , the maximum information rate reliably transmitted to the i d receiver requires that the transmitter send signals continuously , i.e. , @xmath99 , as assumed in problem ( p2 ) .",
    "this can be easily verified by observing that for any @xmath94 and @xmath7 , latexmath:[$\\alpha \\log|{\\mbox{\\boldmath{$ i $ } } } + { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$ h $ } } } ( { \\mbox{\\boldmath{$ s $ } } } /\\alpha){\\mbox{\\boldmath{$ h $ } } } ^h    where the equality holds only when @xmath99 , since @xmath101 is a nonlinear concave function of @xmath2 .",
    "thus , to maximize both power and rate transfer at the same time , the transmitter should broadcast to the eh and i d receivers all the time .",
    "furthermore , note that the assumed gaussian distribution for transmitted signals is necessary for achieving the maximum rate transfer , but not necessary for the maximum power transfer .",
    "in fact , for any arbitrary complex number @xmath102 that satisfies @xmath103 , even a deterministic transmitted signal @xmath104 , achieves the maximum transferred power @xmath105 in problem ( p1 ) .",
    "however , to maximize simultaneous power and information transfer with the same transmitted signal , the gaussian input distribution is sufficient as well as necessary .",
    "now , consider the case where both the eh and i d receivers are present . from the above results",
    ", it is seen that the optimal transmission strategies for maximal power transfer and information transfer are in general different , which are energy beamforming and information spatial multiplexing , respectively .",
    "it thus motivates our investigation of the following question : what is the optimal broadcasting strategy for simultaneous wireless power and information transfer ? to answer this question , we propose to use the _ rate - energy _",
    "( r - e ) region ( defined below ) to characterize all the achievable rate ( in bits / sec / hz or bps for information transfer ) and energy ( in joule / sec or watt for power transfer ) pairs under a given transmit power constraint . without loss of generality , assuming that the transmitter sends gaussian signals continuously ( cf .",
    "remark [ remark : power rate relationship ] ) , the r - e region is defined as @xmath106    in fig .",
    "[ fig : re region mimo ] , an example of the above defined r - e region ( see section [ sec : separated receivers ] for the algorithm to compute the boundary of this region ) is shown for a practical mimo broadcast system with separated eh and i d receivers ( i.e. , @xmath107 ) .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath108 .",
    "the transmitter power is assumed to be @xmath109 watt(w ) or @xmath110dbm .",
    "the distances from the transmitter to the eh and i d receivers are assumed to be @xmath111 meter and @xmath112 meters , respectively ; thus , we can exploit the near - far based energy and information transmission scheduling , which may correspond to , e.g. , a dedicated energy transfer system ( to `` near '' users ) with opportunistic information transmission ( to `` far '' users ) , or vice versa . assuming a carrier frequency of @xmath113mhz and the power pathloss exponent to be 4 , the distance - dependent signal attenuation from the ap to eh / id receiver can be estimated as 40db and 80db , respectively .",
    "accordingly , the average signal power at the eh / id receiver is thus 30dbm@xmath114db@xmath115dbm and 30dbm@xmath116db@xmath117dbm , respectively .",
    "it is further assumed that in addition to signal pathloss , rayleigh fading is present , as such each element of channel matrices @xmath39 and @xmath40 is independently drawn from the cscg distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath1dbm ( for eh receiver ) and @xmath0dbm for ( for i d receiver ) , respectively ( to be consistent with the signal pathloss previously assumed ) .",
    "furthermore , the bandwidth of the transmitted signal is assumed to be 10mhz , while the receiver noise is assumed to be white gaussian with power spectral density @xmath118dbm / hz ( which is dominated by the receiver processing noise rather than the background thermal noise ) or average power @xmath119dbm over the bandwidth of 10mhz . as a result , considering all of transmit power , signal attenuation , fading and receiver noise , the per - antenna average snr at the i d receiver is equal to @xmath120db , which corresponds to @xmath121 in the equivalent signal model for the i d receiver given in ( [ eq : signal model ] ) with unit - norm noise .",

    "[ fig : practical schemes](a ) , we consider the _ time switching _ ( ts ) scheme , with which each transmission block is divided into two orthogonal time slots , one for transferring power and the other for transmitting data . the co - located eh and i d receiver switches its operations periodically between harvesting energy and decoding information between the two time slots .",
    "it is assumed that time synchronization has been perfectly established between the transmitter and the receiver , and thus the receiver can synchronize its function switching with the transmitter . with orthogonal transmissions ,",
    "the transmitted signals for the eh receiver and i d receiver can be designed separately , but subject to a total transmit power constraint .",
    "let @xmath93 with @xmath217 denote the percentage of transmission time allocated to the eh time slot .",
    "we then consider the following two types of power constraints at the transmitter :    * _ fixed power constraint _ : the transmitted signals to the i d and eh receivers have the same fixed power constraint given by @xmath218 , and @xmath219 , where @xmath220 and @xmath221 denote the transmit covariance matrices for the i d and eh transmission time slots , respectively . * _ flexible power constraint _ : the transmitted signals to the i d and eh receivers can have different power constraints provided that their average consumed power is below @xmath95 , i.e. , @xmath222 .",
    "note that the ts scheme under the fixed power constraint has been considered in @xcite for the single - antenna awgn channel .",
    "the achievable r - e regions for the ts scheme with the fixed ( referred to as @xmath223 ) vs. flexible ( referred to as @xmath224 ) power constraints are then given as follows : @xmath225 @xmath226    it is worth noting that @xmath227 must be true since any pair of @xmath228 and @xmath229 that satisfy the fixed power constraint will satisfy the flexible power constraint , but not vice versa .",
    "the optimal transmit covariance matrices @xmath220 and @xmath221 to achieve the boundary of @xmath230 with the fixed power constraint are given in section [ sec : system model ] ( assuming @xmath146 ) .",

    "[ fig : re region co - located receiver 1 ] ) by sweeping @xmath93 from 0 to 1 .    similarly , for the case of flexible power constraint , the transmit covariance solutions for @xmath220 and @xmath221 to achieve any boundary point of @xmath232 can be shown to have the same set of eigenvectors as those given in section [ sec : system model ] ( assuming @xmath146 ) , respectively ; however , the corresponding time allocation for @xmath93 and power allocation for @xmath220 and @xmath221 remain unknown .",
    "we thus have the following proposition .",

    "proposition [ proposition : ts zero alpha ] suggests that to achieve any boundary point @xmath236 of @xmath232 with @xmath237 and @xmath238 , the portion of transmission time @xmath93 allocated to power transfer in each block should asymptotically go to zero when @xmath239 , where @xmath47 denotes the number of transmitted symbols in each block . for example , by allocating @xmath240 symbols per block for power transfer and the remaining symbols for information transmission yields @xmath241 as @xmath239 , which satisfies the optimality condition given in proposition [ proposition : ts zero alpha ] .",
    "it is worth noting that the boundary of @xmath234 in the flexible power constraint case is achieved under the assumption that the transmitter and receiver can both operate in the regime of infinite power in the eh time slot due to @xmath233 , which can not be implemented with practical power amplifiers .",
    "hence , a more feasible region for @xmath232 is obtained by adding peak transmit power constraints in ( [ eq : re region time switching 2 ] ) as @xmath242 and @xmath243 , with @xmath244 . similar to proposition [ proposition : ts zero alpha ] , it can be shown that the boundary of the achievable r - e region in this case , denoted by @xmath245 , is achieved by @xmath246 .",

    "next , we propose an alternative receiver design called _ power splitting _ ( ps ) , whereby the power and information transfer to the co - located eh and i d receivers are simultaneously achieved via a set of power splitting devices , one device for each receiving antenna , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : practical schemes](b ) . in order to gain more insight into the ps scheme ,",

    "[ fig : ps](b ) .    the receiver operations in fig .",
    "[ fig : ps](a ) are explained as follows : the received signal from the antenna is first corrupted by a gaussian noise denoted by @xmath249 at the rf - band , which is assumed to have zero mean and equivalent baseband power @xmath250 .",

    "after the power splitter , the portion of signal power split to the eh receiver is denoted by @xmath198 , and that to the i d receiver by @xmath251 .",
    "the signal split to the i d receiver then goes through a sequence of standard operations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) to be converted from the rf band to baseband . during this process",
    ", the signal is additionally corrupted by another noise @xmath252 , which is independent of @xmath249 and assumed to be gaussian and have zero mean and variance @xmath253 . to be consistent to the case with solely the i d receiver ,",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the antenna noise @xmath249 and processing noise @xmath252 have the same distributions in both figs .",
    "[ fig : ps](a ) and [ fig : ps](b ) .",
    "it is further assumed that @xmath254 to be consistent with the system model introduced in section [ sec : system model ] .    for this simple siso awgn channel ,",
    "we denote the transmit power constraint by @xmath95 and the channel power gain by @xmath255 .",
    "it is then easy to compute the r - e region outer bound @xmath134 for this channel with co - located i d and eh receivers , which is simply a box specified by three vertices @xmath215 , @xmath214 and @xmath256 , with @xmath257 and @xmath258 .",
    "interestingly , we will show next that under certain conditions , the ps scheme can in fact achieve all the rate - energy pairs in this r - e region outer bound ; without loss of generality , it suffices to show that the vertex point @xmath259 is achievable .",
    "with reference to fig .",
    "[ fig : ps](a ) , we discuss the ps scheme in the following three regimes with different values of antenna and processing noise power .",
    "* @xmath260 ( case i ) : in this ideal case with perfect receiving antenna , the antenna noise can be ignored and thus we have @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "accordingly , it is easy to show that the snr , denoted by @xmath263 , at the i d receiver in fig . [ fig : ps](a ) is @xmath264 .",
    "the achievable r - e region in this case is then given by @xmath265 .",
    "this region can be shown to coincide with the r - e region for the ts scheme with the flexible power constraint given by ( [ eq : re region time switching 2 new ] ) for the siso case . *",
    "@xmath266 ( case ii ) : this is the most practically valid case . since @xmath267",
    ", we can show that @xmath263 in this case is given by @xmath268 .",
    "accordingly , the achievable r - e region in this case is given by @xmath269 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath270 enlarges strictly as @xmath250 increases from 0 to 1 . *",
    "@xmath271 ( case iii ) : in this ideal case with perfect rf - to - baseband signal conversion , the processing noise can be ignored and thus we have @xmath272 and @xmath273 . in this case , the snr for the i d receiver is given by @xmath274 , regardless of the value of @xmath198 . thus , to maximize the power transfer ,",
    "ideally we should set @xmath275 , i.e. , splitting infinitesimally small power to the i d receiver since both the signal and antenna noise are scaled identically by the power splitter and there is no additional processing noise induced after the power splitting . with @xmath276 , the achievable r - e region in this case",
    "is given by @xmath277 , which becomes identical to the r - e region outer bound @xmath134 ( which is a box as defined earlier ) .",
    "therefore , we know from the above discussions that only for the case of noise - free rf - band to baseband processing ( i.e. , case iii ) , the ps scheme achieves the r - e region outer bound and is thus optimal .",
    "however , in practice , such a condition can never be met perfectly , and thus the r - e region outer bound @xmath134 is in general still non - achievable with practical ps receivers . in the following",
    ", we will study further the achievable r - e region by the ps scheme for the more general case of mimo channels .",
    "it is not difficult to show that if each receiving antenna satisfies the condition in case iii , the r - e region outer bound @xmath216 defined in ( [ eq : re region ] ) with @xmath146 is achievable for the mimo case by the ps scheme ( with each receiving antenna to set @xmath276 ) . for a more practical purpose ,",
    "we consider in the rest of this section the `` worst '' case performance of the ps scheme ( i.e. , case i in the above ) , when the noiseless antenna is assumed ( which leads to the smallest r - e region for the siso awgn channel case ) .",
    "the obtained r - e region will thus provide the performance lower bound for the ps scheme with practical receiver circuits . in this case , since there is no antenna noise and the processing noise is added after the power splitting , it is equivalent to assume that the aggregated receiver noise power remains unchanged with a power splitter at each receiving antenna .",
    "let @xmath278 with @xmath279 denote the portion of power split to the eh receiver at the @xmath280th receiving antenna , @xmath281 .",
    "the achievable r - e region for the ps scheme ( in the worst case ) is thus given by @xmath282 where @xmath283 , and @xmath284 .",
