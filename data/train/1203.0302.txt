    "galaxy clustering has proven to be invaluable in assembling our current picture of a universe with a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbations @xcite .",
    "the principle tool in clustering studies has been the two - point correlation function , or in fourier space the power spectrum , determined under the assumption of statistical isotropy ( si ) . with the advent of new generations of galaxy surveys , as well as longer - term prospects for measuring the primordial mass distribution with 21-cm surveys of the epoch of reionization @xcite and/or dark ages @xcite , it is worthwhile to think about what can be further done with these measurements .",
    "many inflationary models introduce new fields that may couple to the inflaton responsible for generating curvature perturbations .",
    "the effects of these fields may then appear as local departures from si , or as non - gaussianity , in the curvature perturbation .",
    "for example , models with an additional scalar field introduce a nontrivial four - point correlation function ( or trispectrum , in fourier space ) @xcite , which we below will describe as local departures from statistical isotropy ; apart from this correlation , the scalar field may leave no visible trace .",
    "there may also be vector ( spin-1 ) fields @xmath0 @xcite  or vector spacetime - metric perturbations brought to life in alternative - gravity theories @xcite  that , if coupled to the inflaton @xmath1 ( e.g. , through a term @xmath2 ) may leave an imprint on the primordial mass distribution without leaving any other observable trace .",
    "similar correlations with a tensor ( i.e. , spin-2 ) field @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xmath4 ) can be envisioned . even in the absence of new fields , there are tensor metric perturbations ( gravitational waves ) that may be correlated with the primordial curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "tensor distortions to the two - point correlation function ( `` metric shear '' ) may also be introduced at late times @xcite , and late - time nonlinear effects may induce scalar - like distortions to the two - point function @xcite .    here",
    "we describe how the fossils of primordial tensor , vector , and scalar fields are imprinted on the mass distribution in the universe today .",
    "we express these relics in terms of two - point correlations that depart locally from si or off - diagonal correlations of the density - field fourier components .",
    "this formalism allows the correlations to be decomposed geometrically into scalar , vector , and tensor components .",
    "we write down the optimal estimators for these scalar , vector , and tensor correlations and quantify the amplitudes that can be detected if these perturbations have ( as may be expected in inflationary models ) nearly scale - invariant spectra .",
    "we begin with the null hypothesis that primordial density perturbations are statistically isotropic and gaussian .",
    "this implies that the fourier modes @xmath5 of the density perturbation @xmath6 ( at some fixed time ) have covariances , @xmath7 , where the kronecker ( dirac ) delta on the right - hand side is zero unless @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the matter power spectrum , and @xmath10 is the volume of the survey . in other words ,",
    "the different fourier modes of the density field are uncorrelated under the null hypothesis .",
    "coupling of the inflaton to some other field produces non - gaussianity in the mass distribution that appears as off - diagonal ( i.e. , @xmath11 ) correlations of the density - field fourier components in the presence of a given realization of the new field .",
    "global si requires that a given fourier mode @xmath12 of wavevector @xmath13 and polarization @xmath14 ( about which we will say more below ) of the new field induces a correlation , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is shorthand for a kronecker delta that sets @xmath17 .",
    "note that @xmath12 here are the new - field fourier components during inflation when their effect on primordial perturbations is imprinted .",
    "the function @xmath18 is related to the density - density  new - field bispectrum @xmath19 and new - field power spectrum @xmath20 through @xmath21 .",
    "global si requires that @xmath18 be a function only of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 labels the polarization state of the new field and @xmath25 its polarization tensor , a symmetric @xmath26 tensor .",
    "the most general such tensor can be decomposed into 6 orthogonal polarization states @xcite , which we label @xmath27 , that satisfy @xmath28 .",
    "these states can be taken to be two scalar modes @xmath29 and @xmath30 , two vector modes @xmath31 with @xmath32 , and two transverse traceless modes ( the `` tensor '' modes ) @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "if @xmath13 is taken to be in the @xmath35 direction , then the @xmath36 polarization of the tensor mode has @xmath37 with all other components zero , and the @xmath38 polarization has @xmath39 with all other components zero .",
    "these two tensor modes are thus characterized by a @xmath40 or @xmath41 dependence , for @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively , on the azimuthal angle about the @xmath13 direction of the tensor mode .",
    "the first two columns in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture ] show the distortions induced to an otherwise isotropic two - point correlation function by correlation of the density field with a @xmath36 and @xmath38 polarized tensor mode .",
    "shown there is a quadrupolar distortion in the @xmath44-@xmath45 plane that then oscillates in phase as we move along the direction @xmath35 of the fourier mode .",
    "the first scalar mode has @xmath46 and as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture ] represents an isotropic modulation of the correlation function as we move along the direction @xmath35 of the fourier wavevector .",
    "the other scalar ( or longitudinal - vector ) mode has @xmath47 which represents a stretching and compression along @xmath35 .",
    "both scalar modes represent local distortions of the two - point function that have azimuthal symmetry about @xmath13 .",
    "finally , the two transverse - vector modes have @xmath48 with all other components zero , and @xmath49 with all other components zero .",
    "these two modes represent stretching in the @xmath50 and @xmath51 directions , respectively , as shown in the last @xmath52 and @xmath53 columns in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture ] .",
    "these two transverse - vector modes have @xmath54 and @xmath55 dependences on the azimuthal angle @xmath56 about the direction of the fourier mode .",
    "the specific functional form of @xmath18 depends on the coupling of the new field ( scalar , vector , or tensor ) to the inflaton .",
    "global si requires , though , that @xmath18 will be the same for the two tensor polarizations and the same for the two vector polarizations ; i.e. , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",
    "the same is not necessarily true for the scalar perturbations .",
    "in fact , the polar - angle dependence that distinguishes the 0 and @xmath59 polarizations can be absorbed into @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "thus , in practice , one can describe the most general scalar distortions to clustering in terms of either the 0 or the @xmath59 polarization by appropriate definition of @xmath60 or @xmath61 .",
    "( this is the mixing between a scalar mode and a longitudinal - vector mode . )",
    "we thus below merge these two polarizations into a single polarization which we label with a subscript @xmath62 .",
    "suppose now that a correlation such as that in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : offdiagonal ] ) , for either a scalar , vector , or tensor distortion , is hypothesized .",
    "how would we go about measuring it ? according to eq .",
    "( [ eqn : offdiagonal ] ) , each pair @xmath63 and @xmath64 of density modes with @xmath65 ( note that we have re - defined the sign of @xmath13 here ) provides an estimator , @xmath66^{-1},\\ ] ] for the fourier - polarization amplitude @xmath12 . since @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the measured matter power spectrum , including the signal @xmath9 and noise @xmath69 , the variance of this estimator is @xmath70 the minimum - variance estimator for @xmath12 is then obtained by summing over all these individual @xmath71 pairs with inverse - variance weighting : @xmath72 where the noise power spectrum , @xmath73^{-1 } , \\label{eqn : noisepowerspectrum}\\ ] ] is the variance with which @xmath74 is measured .",
    "this @xmath75 is a function only of the magnitude @xmath76 ( not its orientation ) as a consequence of global si , and for the same reason , @xmath77 , for both the signal and noise power spectra , and similarly @xmath78 .    in general , the amplitudes @xmath12",
    "arise as realizations of random fields with power spectra @xmath79 , for @xmath80 , which we write in terms of amplitudes @xmath81 and fiducial power spectra @xmath82 .",
    "we now proceed to write the optimal estimator for the amplitudes @xmath81 .",
    "each fourier - mode estimator @xmath74 for the appropriate polarizations ( @xmath62 for scalar , @xmath44 and @xmath45 for vector , and @xmath36 and @xmath38 for tensor ) provides an estimator , @xmath83^{-1 }       \\left[{v}^{-1 } \\left|\\widehat { h_p(\\veck ) } \\right|^2 -       p_p^{n}(k ) \\right ] , \\label{eqn : individualestimator}\\ ] ] for the appropriate power - spectrum amplitude .",
    "here we have subtracted out the noise contribution to unbias the estimator .",
    "if @xmath74 is estimated from a large number of @xmath63-@xmath64 pairs , then it is close to being a gaussian variable .",
    "if so , then the variance of the estimator in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : individualestimator ] ) is , under the null hypothesis , @xmath84^{-2 }      \\left [ p_p^{n}(k)\\right]^2.\\ ] ] adding the estimators from each fourier mode with inverse - variance weighting leads us to the optimal estimator , @xmath85 ^ 2       } { 2\\left[p_p^{n}(k ) \\right]^2 }       \\left ( v^{-1 } \\left|\\widehat { { h}_p(\\veck ) }       \\right|^2 - p_p^{n}(k ) \\right ) ,   \\label{eqn : tensorestimator}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 ^ 2 / 2 \\left[p_p^{n}(k ) \\right]^2 .",
    "\\label{eqn : noise}\\ ] ] for the vector - power - spectrum amplitude @xmath87 we sum over @xmath88 and for the tensor - power - spectrum amplitude @xmath89 over @xmath90 . following",
    "the discussion above , the sum on @xmath14 is only for @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "the estimator in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tensorestimator ] ) , along with the quadratic minimum - variance estimator in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : minimvariance ] ) , demonstrates that the correlation of density perturbations with an unseen scalar , vector , or tensor perturbation appears in the density field as a nontrivial four - point correlation function , or trispectrum .",
    "the dependence of the trispectrum on the azimuthal angle about the diagonal of the fourier - space quadrilateral distinguishes the shape dependences of the trispectra for scalar , vector , and tensor modes . to specify this trispectrum more precisely , though , requires inclusion of the additional contribution induced by modes @xmath13 that involve the other two diagonals of the quadrilateral .",
    "likewise , if a signal is detected  i.e .",
    ", if the null - hypothesis estimators above are found to depart at @xmath93 from the null hypothesis  then the optimal measurement and characterization of the trispectrum requires modification of the null - hypothesis estimators in a manner analogous to weak - lensing estimators @xcite .",
    "we now evaluate the smallest amplitudes @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 that can be detected with a given survey . to do so , we take for our fiducial models nearly scale - invariant spectra @xmath97 , with @xmath98 .",
    "we moreover take the density - density  new - field bispectrum to be of the form in ref .",
    "we then find that the integrand ( using @xmath99 ) in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : noisepowerspectrum ] ) is dominated by the squeezed limit ( @xmath100 ) where @xmath101 .",
    "we then approximate @xmath102 for @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the largest wavenumber for which the power spectrum can be measured with high signal to noise , and @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "this then yields a noise power spectrum @xmath107 and @xmath108 . evaluating the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : noise ] ) , we find the scalar , vector , and tensor amplitudes detectable at @xmath109 ( for @xmath110 ) to be @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "the smallest detectable power - spectra amplitudes are thus inversely proportional to the number of fourier modes in the survey .",
    "we show the projected detection sensitivities for surveys with volumes of @xmath114 ^ 3 $ ] and @xmath115 ^ 3 $ ] in fig .",
    "[ fig : ston ] .    , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , respectively , detectable at the 3@xmath116 level as a function of the maximum wavenumber @xmath104 of the survey . shown",
    "are results for survey volumes of @xmath115 ^ 3 $ ] and @xmath114 ^ 3 $ ] , or minimum wavenumbers @xmath117 $ ] and @xmath118 $ ] , respectively .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]    for example , if we apply this estimate to a tensor field and assume this tensor field to be primordial gravitational waves , then a sensitivity to a tensor amplitude @xmath119 near the current upper limit requires @xmath120 .",
    "such a dynamic range is probably beyond the reach of galaxy surveys , but it may be within reach of the 21-cm probes of neutral hydrogen during the dark ages envisioned in refs .  @xcite . of course , the signal could be larger if the inflaton is correlated with a scalar , vector , or tensor field that leaves no other trace .",
    "finally , several new tests for parity - violating early - universe physics can be developed from simple modification of the estimators above .",
    "to do so , we substitute the @xmath44 and @xmath45 polarizations , and @xmath36 and @xmath38 polarizations , with circular - polarization tensors @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "the two right - most patterns shown in fig .  [ fig : picture ] are the circular polarization patterns for tensor and vector modes .",
    "it may then be tested whether the power spectra for right- and left - circular polarizations are equal .",
    "for example , chiral - gravity models @xcite may predict such parity - violating signatures in primordial gravitational waves , and similar models with parity - violating vector perturbations are easily imaginable .",
    "of course , `` real - world '' effects like redshift - space distortions , biasing , and nonlinear evolution , must be taken into account before the estimators written above can be implemented , but there are well - developed techniques to deal with these issues @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the most general two - point correlation functions for the cosmological mass distribution can be decomposed into scalar , vector , and tensor distortions .",
    "we have presented straightforward recipes for measuring these distortions .",
    "such effects may arise if the inflaton is coupled to some new field during inflation .",
    "we have avoided discussion of specific models , but the introduction of new fields during inflation is quite generic to inflationary models .",
    "we therefore advocate measurement of these correlations with galaxy surveys , and in the future with 21-cm surveys , as a simple and general probe of new inflationary physics .",
