    "the magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the departures from this idealized situation are usually parametrized according to the reynolds @xmath0 and magnetic reynolds @xmath1 numbers , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 stand for the relevant characteristic velocity and lengthscale and @xmath4 and @xmath5 stand for the kinematic viscosity and resistivity .",
    "the ideal mhd regime is then formally identified with the limit @xmath6 .",
    "there are many situations of interest in which the effects of dissipation need to be considered .    from the astrophysical point of view ,",
    "accretion disks around young stellar objects constitute one of the most compelling reasons for investigating the mri beyond the ideal limit . in particular , there is great interest in understanding to what extent can mhd turbulence driven by the mri enable efficient angular momentum transport in cool , poorly conducting , protoplanetary disks ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "most of the studies addressing the effects of dissipation in non - ideal mri have usually focused in inviscid , resistive plasmas .",
    "however , accretion disks are characterized by a wide range of magnetic prandtl numbers , with @xmath7 varying by several orders of magnitude across the entire disk ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in order to understand the behavior of the mri under these conditions it is necessary to relax the assumption of an inviscid plasma .    a large fraction of the shearing box simulations addressing the non - linear regime of the mri have been carried out in the ideal mhd limit , i.e. , without including explicit dissipation in the codes ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , even in the absence of explicit viscosity and resistivity , finite difference discretization leads to numerical diffusion / dissipation . therefore , even in this type of simulations , it is necessary to understand the impact of these numerical artifacts that lead to departures from the ideal mhd regime and how similar they are when compared with physical ( resolved ) dissipation .",
    "a handful of numerical studies with explicit resistivity but zero physical viscosity have been carried out in order to understand the effects of ohmic dissipation in the saturation of mri - driven turbulence ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in particular , @xcite have shown that the saturation level of the stresses increases with increasing magnetic reynolds number and seem to converge to an asymptotic value for magnetic reynolds numbers larger than unity .",
    "recent work has pointed out problems with convergence in zero - net - flux numerical simulations of ideal mhd driven by the mri @xcite implying the necessity of incorporating explicit dissipation in the codes .",
    "numerical studies with both resistivity and viscosity , in the presence of a mean vertical magnetic field @xcite and in the case of zero net flux @xcite , have begun to uncover how the characteristics of fully developed mri - driven turbulence depends on the reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers . even though the ranges in reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers that can be currently addressed is still limited , the results obtained from the simulations suggest that the magnetic and kinetic energies contained in turbulent motions in the saturated regime depend on the values of the microphysical viscosity and resistivity .",
    "in particular , the mean angular momentum transport in the turbulent state increases with increasing magnetic prandtl number .    from the experimental perspective , understanding the effects of non - vanishing resistivity and viscosity in the behavior of the mri seems imperative , since the physical conditions achievable in the laboratory depart significantly from the ideal mhd regime @xcite .",
    "liquid metals ( such as sodium , gallium , and mercury ) are often characterized by rather low magnetic prandtl numbers ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) . although the regime of reynolds numbers involved is still orders of magnitude smaller than any astrophysical system with similar magnetic prandtl numbers ,",
    "mri experiments offer one of the few prospects of studying anything close to mhd astrophysical processes in the laboratory .    a number of analyses addressing some aspects of the impact of viscosity and resistivity on the mri in various dissipative limits appear scattered throughout the literature on theoretical , numerical , and experimental mri .",
    "more recently , @xcite have found particular solutions of the viscous , resistive mhd equations ( including even a cooling term ) in the shearing box approximation .",
    "however , we are unaware of any comprehensive , systematic study addressing how the mri behaves in viscous , resistive , differentially rotating magnetized plasmas for arbitrary combinations of the reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers .",
    "the aim of this work is to carry out this analysis in detail .",

    "sec : mri_modes ] , we address the unexplored physical structure of mri modes for finite reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers and derive simple analytical expressions that describe these modes in various asymptotic regimes . in ",
    "[ sec : stresses_energies ] , we calculate the correlations between magnetic and velocity mri - driven perturbations that are related to angular momentum transport and energy densities . we find that some key results previously shown to hold in the ideal mhd limit @xcite are also valid in the non - ideal regime . in particular , we show that even though the effectiveness with which the mri disrupts the laminar flow depends on the reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers , the instability always transports angular momentum outwards .",
    "we also find that magnetic perturbations dominate both the energetics and the transport of angular momentum for any combination of the reynolds and magnetic reynolds numbers . in   [ sec : discussion ] we summarize our findings and discuss the implications of our study .",

    "this has a series of important implications , in particular , there is always a range of wavenumbers for which the discriminant in equation ( [ eq : eigenvalues_sigma ] ) is positive , i.e. , @xmath105 .",
    "it can also be seen that the last two terms between parentheses in equation ( [ eq : eigenvalues_sigma ] ) are always positive , i.e. , @xmath106 , and thus they always produce damping .",

    "these growth rates are more sensitive to changes in the resistivity than to changes in the viscosity . a qualitative understanding of this behavior can be obtained by realizing that viscosity tends to quench the instability , without altering the large scale magnetic field .",

    "mathematically , the asymmetric response of the growth rate to changes in the viscosity @xmath4 or the resistivity @xmath5 originates in the different functional form of the terms that contribute to produce damping , i.e. , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , in the exponential growth characterized by @xmath110 in equation ( [ eq : eigenvalues_gamma_pm ] ) .",

    "the fact that this same behavior is indeed seen when the stresses are due to viscous , resistive mri modes ( see figure  [ fig : txy_rmpm ] ) rises the question of how strong is the influence of long - lived , channel - like modes on the fully developed turbulent state reached in shearing box simulations with net magnetic flux through the vertical boundaries .",

    "the effects of varying the reynolds number at fixed magnetic prandtl number on the saturation of mri - driven turbulence are currently rather uncertain ( see , in particular , the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "the global trends exhibited by the available simulations suggest that the stresses at saturation increase with increasing reynolds number for magnetic prandtl numbers smaller than unity while the opposite behavior is observed for magnetic prandtl numbers larger than unity .",

    "the comparison between the late time behavior of the viscous , resistive mri modes and fully developed mhd turbulence with dissipation will shed light into the mechanisms that lead to the saturation of the mri in different dissipative regimes .",
    "finally , most current numerical algorithms employ finite difference methods ( with constrained transport for the evolution of the magnetic field ) .",
    "the leading order errors in first - order upwind methods behave like diffusion , however , in second - order central difference methods , the leading order errors are dispersive ( artificial viscosities are usually employed to damp unphysical oscillations near shocks ) .",
    "the comparison between numerical solutions from different algorithms can provide estimates of these errors .",
