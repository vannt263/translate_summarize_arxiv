    "many scientists considered that large trans - neptunian objects ( tnos ) and asteroids were formed by accumulation of smaller ( e.g. , 1-km ) planetesimals .",
    "such process of accumulation of tnos needs small ( @xmath00.001 ) eccentricities and a massive belt which probably could not exist during the time needed for such accumulation .",
    "therefore ipatov ( 2001 ) considered that large tnos and some main - belt asteroids could be formed directly from dust rarefied condensations .",
    "it is assumed by many authors that a lot of dust condensations were formed from a dust disk around the forming sun .",
    "these initial condensations coagulated under collisions and formed larger condensations , which compressed and formed solid planetesimals . to our opinion , during the time needed for compression of condensations into planetesimals , some largest final condensations could reach such masses that they formed initial planetesimals with diameter equal to several hundreds kilometers . as in the case of accumulation of planetesimals , there could be a `` run - away '' accretion of condensations . some smaller objects ( tnos , planetesimals , asteroids ) could be debris of larger objects , and other such objects could be formed directly by compression of condensations .    a small portion of planetesimals from the feeding zone of the giant planets that entered into the trans - neptunian region could be left in eccentrical orbits beyond neptune and became so called  scattered disk objects  ( sdos ) .",
    "the end of the bombardment of the terrestrial planets could be caused mainly by those planetesimals that had become sdos .",
    "our estimates ( ipatov 1995 , 2001 ) showed that collisional lifetimes of 1-km tnos and asteroids are about 1 gyr .",
    "typical tnos can be even more often destroyed by sdos than by other tnos .",
    "mutual gravitational interactions of tnos can play a larger role in variations of their orbital elements than collisions .",
    "the motion of tnos to jupiter s orbit was investigated by several authors ( e.g. , levison & duncan 1997 ) .",
    "proceeding from the total of @xmath1 1-km tnos within 30@xmath2@xmath3@xmath250 au , assuming the mean time @xmath4@xmath50.13 myr for a body to move in a jupiter - crossing orbit , and using the same formulas and other estimates as those in ( ipatov 2001 ) , we obtain that about @xmath6 of former 1-km tnos now are jupiter - crossers . in the present paper",
    "we pay the main attention to the migration of jupiter - crossing objects ( jcos ) .",
    "our present investigations are based on our runs of the orbital evolution of thousands jcos under gravitational influence of all planets , except for mercury and pluto , for intervals @xmath7@xmath810 myr ( for comet 2p we also considered mercury ) .",
    "the integration package by levison & duncan ( 1994 ) was used .",
    "below we present the results obtained only by the method by bulirsh and stoer ( bulsto code ) , though we also considered the evolution of thousands of objects using a symplectic method . in some cases in our runs (",
    "especially , when objects can get close to the sun ) we obtained a considerable difference between the results obtained by bulsto and a symplectic method .",
    "for bulsto the relative error per integration step was taken ( depending on the run ) to be less than @xmath9 which was @xmath10 , @xmath11 , or some intermediate value .    in the first series of runs ( denoted as @xmath12 ) we investigated the orbital evolution of @xmath13=1900 jcos moving in initial orbits close to those of 20 real jcos with period 5@xmath2@xmath14@xmath29 yr . in each of other series of runs we considered initial orbits close to that of one comet ( 2p , 9p , 10p , 22p , 28p , or 39p ) .",
    "we also studied the evolution of asteroids initially moving in the resonances 3:1 and 5:2 with jupiter .",
    "approximate values of initial semi - major axes @xmath3 , eccentricities @xmath15 and inclinations @xmath16 of considered objects are presented in table 1 .",
    "for jcos we varied only initial mean anomaly , and for asteroids we varied also initial value of the longitude of the ascending node .",
    "examples of time variations in orbital elements are presented in figs . 1 - 2 .",
    "as these two objects have large probabilities of collisions with the terrestrial planets , they are not included in the table . in fig .",
    "3 we present the time in myr during which 7852 former jcos had semi - major axes in the interval with a width of 0.005 au ( left ) or 0.1 au ( right ) .",
    "we did not simulate collisions of objects with planets , but basing on orbital elements obtained with a step 500 yr , for all @xmath13 objects we calculated the total impacting probability @xmath17 and the total time interval @xmath18 to reach perihelion distance @xmath19 less than a semi - major axis of a planet , and then impact probabilities per one object @xmath20=@xmath21=@xmath22 and @xmath23=@xmath24 during @xmath7 were estimated .",
    "@xmath25v@xmath26v@xmath26e@xmath26e@xmath26m@xmath26m@xmath272p@xmath289p@xmath2910p@xmath3022p@xmath3128p@xmath3239p@xmath33total@xmath34    in table 1 we also present the ratio @xmath35 of time spent in apollo orbits ( @xmath3@xmath361 au , @xmath19=@xmath37@xmath21.017 au ) at @xmath15@xmath20.999 to that in amor orbits ( 1.017@xmath2@xmath19@xmath21.33 au ) .",
    "one object initially moving in orbit close to that of comet 10p after having aten - type orbit ( @xmath3@xmath21 au , @xmath38=@xmath39@xmath360.983 au ) during 3 myr ( the probability of its collision with the earth was 0.34 ) got orbits with aphelion distance @xmath38@xmath20.983 au ( fig .",
    "the probability of its collision with venus during @xmath40@xmath4150 myr was @xmath53 , so more probable that it collided venus at @xmath40@xmath515 myr .",
    "specific mass of the matter delivered by jcos to an inner planet ( normalized to its mass ) turns out to be nearly the same for earth and venus though greater for mars . the total collisional probability with the inner planets was mainly caused by a small ( @xmath00.01 - 0.001 ) fraction of bodies residing in orbits deep inside jupiter s orbit for more than 1 myr .",
    "fifteen considered objects with initial orbits close to those of 10p and 2p moved in earth - crossing orbits with 1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath22 au during more than 0.5 myr each . at @xmath12 , objects moved with periods @xmath14@xmath210 and 10@xmath2@xmath14@xmath220 yr during 11% and 21% of @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "more details of the runs can be found in our papers in htpp://arxiv.org / archive / astro - ph .",
    "in total , 6852 considered jcos moved during more than 160 , 470 , 65 , 140 , and 10 myr in amor , apollo , and aten orbits , orbits with 1@xmath2@xmath3@xmath22 au and @xmath19@xmath21 au , and orbits with @xmath38@xmath20.983 , respectively .",
    "so , if we consider @xmath6 former 1-km tnos now moving in jupiter - crosing orbits , then for @xmath4=0.13 myr their number for the above five types of orbits is about 1600 , 4700 , 650 , 1400 , and 100 , respectively . as we simulated mainly orbits with large probabilities of collisions with the earth",
    ", the above numbers can be smaller by a factor of several .",
    "mean eccentricities of such orbits are larger and the probabilities of collisions with the terrestrial planets are smaller than those of the observed neos . probably , most of such former tnos ( extinct comets ) are not yet observed , as most of the time they move relatively far from the earth .",
    "it is considered that about 750 of 1-km bodies are located in the earth - crossing orbits ( half of them are in orbits with @xmath3@xmath22 au ) , although this number does not include those in high eccentric orbits .",
    "our estimates show that , in principle , the trans - neptunian belt can provide a considerable portion of earth - crossing objects , at least many of those with @xmath3@xmath362 au , but , of course , some neos came from the main asteroid belt .",
    "it may be possible to explore former tnos near the earth s orbit without sending spacecrafts beyond neptune .",
    "based on the estimated collision probability @xmath20=@xmath42 ( this value is a little larger than that for @xmath12 , but is smaller by an order of magnitude than @xmath20=@xmath43 obtained for 7852 jcos ) and assuming the total mass of planetesimals that ever crossed jupiter s orbit is @xmath0100@xmath44 ( @xmath44 is mass of the earth ) , we found that the total mass of bodies impacted on the earth is @xmath45 .",
    "if ices composed only a half of this mass , then the total mass of ices that were delivered to the earth from the feeding zone of the giant planets turns out by the factor of 1.5 greater than the mass of the earth oceans .",
    "ancient oceans on mars and venus could be also large ."
