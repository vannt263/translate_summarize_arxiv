    "supersymmetric yang - mills theories are interesting both as playgrounds for understanding quantum field theory and as gauge theories which are conjectured to be dual to certain string theories @xcite .",
    "typically these dualities between string and gauge theory require that the gauge theory be taken at strong coupling .",
    "this requirement motivates defining the theory on a lattice which would allow for strong coupling expansions and monte carlo simulation .",
    "perhaps the simplest of these gauge - gravity dualties is exhibited by the conjectured equivalence of the type iia string theory containing @xmath4 @xmath5-branes and super yang - mills quantum mechanics with gauge group @xmath6 .",
    "more specifically the large @xmath4 limit of the gauge model at low temperature @xmath7 or strong ",
    "t hooft coupling is thought to provide a description of the black hole that arises in the low energy supergravity limit of the string theory .",
    "initial investigations of this and related models have been reported in the literature @xcite .",
    "the numerical work so far has employed actions that do not possess an exact supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this work is to derive lattice actions which retain an exact supersymmetry at non - zero lattice spacing which could be used in similar monte carlo studies .",
    "unfortunately , conventional discretizations of supersymmetric theories break supersymmetry completely and the resultant lattice theories typically require a great deal of fine tuning in order that supersymmetry is recovered in the continuum limit @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that in theories with a multiple of @xmath8 supercharges , where @xmath9 is the total number of spacetime dimensions , one or more supersymmetries can be retained provided the discretization scheme is chosen carefully .",
    "two approaches have been successfully pursued based on either orbifolding a supersymmetric matrix model @xcite or direct discretization of a reformulation of the continuum supersymmetric theory in terms of so - called _ twisted _ variables @xcite .",
    "recently , these two approaches have been shown to be equivalent @xcite .",
    "the idea of twisting goes back to the seminal paper of witten in which the twisted formulation was used to construct a topological field theory @xcite .",
    "the process naturally exposes a nilpotent scalar supersymmetry with the topological sector of the twisted theory corresponding to operators invariant under the action of this scalar supersymmetry . in the context of creating supersymmetric lattice theories",
    "this projection to the @xmath10-invariant subspace is dropped and the twisting ( in flat space ) is simply regarded as a convenient change of variables - one more suitable for discretization .",
    "indeed , the fermionic content is then encoded by a series of antisymmetric tensor fields which can be embedded as components of one or more khler - dirac fields @xcite . as was shown by rabin @xcite",
    ", theories involving khler - dirac fields may be discretized without inducing fermion doubling problems and indeed at the level of free field theory the resultant lattice theories are equivalent to staggered fermions @xcite .",
    "in addition to a geometrical treatment of the fermions the twisted formulation has the merit of allowing the action to be written in @xmath10-exact form .",
    "thus the problem of translating the @xmath10-invariance of the continuum theory to the lattice is replaced by the simpler requirement of keeping the scalar supercharge nilpotent when acting on the lattice fields .",
    "typically this is a much simpler proposition and is the one adopted by all discretizations of the twisted theories considered so far @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we start from the twisted forms of the gauge theories in two , three and four dimensions which possess @xmath0 and @xmath1 supersymmetries and dimensionally reduce them to one ( euclidean ) dimension .",
    "the resultant continuum theories can be written in terms of multiples of the basic khler - dirac field which in one dimension which contains one scalar and one vector field .",
    "we show also that each new scalar fermion is associated with an additional scalar supersymmetry which is inherited from the dimensional reduction .",
    "discretization then proceeds using a prescription due to sugino @xcite .",
