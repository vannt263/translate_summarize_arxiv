    "during the impulsive phase of a solar flare , accelerated electrons propogate along closed magnetic field lines to the dense , underlying chromosphere , where they lose their energy via coloumb collisions and heat the local plasma .",
    "the resulting expansion of this plasma is known as `` chromospheric evaporation '' . from the hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite , and more recently @xcite , the solar atmosphere",
    "is predicted to respond in one of two ways , depending on the flux of accelerated nonthermal electrons .        for electron fluxes",
    "@xmath610@xmath7  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath4 , the evaporated plasma flows upwards at several tens of kilometers per second , with no associated downflows .",
    "this process is termed ` gentle ' evaporation .",
    "gentle evaporation may also occur during the decay phase , when the upflows are driven by thermal conduction rather than electron beam heating ( @xcite ) .",
    "many studies have reported evidence for conduction driven evaporation during the decay phase of solar flares ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in each of these studies",
    "it was concluded that the late phase evaporation was caused by heat conduction along field lines connecting the chromosphere to the corona .",
    "evidence for gentle evaporation was also presented by @xcite during flare precursor events , but the mechanism responsible could not be verified . to date , there has been no direct evidence for gentle evaporation due to nonthermal electrons during the impulsive phase of a solar flare .    at high nonthermal electron fluxes ( @xmath83@xmath110@xmath7  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ) , the chromosphere is unable to radiate at a sufficient rate and",
    "consequently expands rapidly .",
    "the heated chromospheric plasma ( @xmath910@xmath10  k ) expands upwards at hundreds of kilometers per second in a process known as ` explosive ' evaporation .",
    "the overpressure of the flare plasma relative to the underlying chromosphere also causes cooler , more dense material to expand downwards at tens of kilometers per second .",
    "this process is known as ` chromospheric condensation ' . a strong case for explosive evaporation",
    "was presented by @xcite , who reported oppositely directed flows using the coronal diagnostic spectrometer ( cds ; @xcite ) on board the _ solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) _ during a hard x - ray ( hxr ) burst . a more recent study by milligan et al .",
    "( 2006 ; hereafter referred to as paper i ) also found these flows patterns , but critically , were able to derive the properties of the driving electron beam using simultaneous hxr imaging and spectroscopy from the _ reuven ramaty high - energy solar spectroscopic imager _ ( _ rhessi _ ; @xcite ) .    in this _",
    "we present the first observational evidence for gentle chromospheric evaporation due to nonthermal electrons during the impulsive phase of a solar flare .",
    "a brief overview of the instruments and data analysis is given in ",
    "[ obs ] ( a more detailed description can be found in paper i ) .",
    "our results are then presented in   [ results ] , while a discussion and conclusions are given in   [ disc ] .",
    "our study focuses on a compact goes c9.1 flare , which began at 11:40:08  ut on 2002 july 15 .",
    "the flare occured close to the solar meridian ( -40@xmath11 , 232@xmath11 ) during a joint observing plan between _ rhessi _ and other ground- and space - based observatories .",
    "unfortunately , there were no complimentary euv images available from either the euv imaging telescope ( eit ) or the _ transition region and coronal explorer _ during the event .",
    "the cds observations reported here were aquired with the _ flare_ar _ observing sequence ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "images taken during the impulsive phase in the ( 584.33   ) , ( 629.73   ) , and ( 592.23   ) emission lines are shown in figure  [ hsi_cds ] .",
    "spectra from each cds pixel were fitted with a broadened gaussian profile @xcite , for each of the spectral windows .",
    "velocities were found by measuring doppler shifts relative to quiet - sun spectra , which were assumed to be emitted by stationary plasma .",
    "a heliographic correction was also applied assuming purely radial flows .",
    "_ rhessi _ is an imaging spectrometer capable of observing x- and @xmath12-ray emission over a wide range of energies ( @xmath93  kev17  mev ) .",
    "the thin attenuators on _ rhessi _ were in place during part of the impulsive phase of this event , thus limiting the energy range to @xmath86  kev .",
    "flare emission was not observed above @xmath950  kev .",
    "the observing summary data for the energy ranges 612 , 1225 , and 2550  kev , are shown in the top panel of figure  [ hsi_ltc_spec ] . as _ rhessi _ went into eclipse at @xmath911:49:00  ut , the goes lightcurve for this event has been overplotted for completeness .",
    "both the _ rhessi _ images and spectra were obtained over a 76 second period from 11:43:3611:44:52  ut to coincide with the time range over which cds observed blueshifts in the line .",
    "this time interval is indicated by two vertical dotted lines in the top panel of figure  [ hsi_ltc_spec ] and includes the impulsive 2550  kev hxr burst .",
    "_ rhessi _ images in two energy bands ( 616 and 1650  kev ) were reconstructed using the _ pixon _ algorithm @xcite .",
    "contours at 5% and 10% of the peak intensity , respectively , in each band are overlayed on each euv image in figure  [ hsi_cds ] .",
    "the _ rhessi _",
    "spectrum was fitted assuming an isothermal distribution at low energies and thick - target emission at higher energies ( bottom panel of figure  [ hsi_ltc_spec ] ) .",
    "the thick - target model solution consistant with the _ rhessi _ photon spectrum produced an electron distribution with a low - energy cutoff ( @xmath13 ) of @xmath9  20  kev , and a power - law index ( @xmath14 ) of @xmath9  5.2 ; a break energy of @xmath920  kev in the electron spectrum corresponds to a break energy of @xmath916  kev for the associated photon spectrum . from the properties of the inferred electron spectrum ,",
    "the total power of nonthermal electrons was found to be @xmath98@xmath110@xmath15  ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "the reconstructed 1650  kev image yielded an upper limit to the hxr source size of @xmath91.8@xmath110@xmath16  @xmath17 , and the resulting flux of nonthermal electrons was therefore found to be @xmath05@xmath110@xmath2  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath4 .",

    "rhessi_. moderately strong upflows of 110@xmath558  km  s@xmath4 were observed in the map by averaging over the same area .",

    "simultaneous x - ray and euv observations of gentle chromospheric evaporation during the impulsive phase of a c9.1 solar flare are presented using data from _ rhessi _ and _ soho_/cds . until now",
    ", studies that reported evidence for gentle evaporation were entirely focused on low - velocity ( @xmath18  80  km  s@xmath4 ) mass motions observed during the decay phase of solar flares ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in each of these cases ,",
    "the mechanism responsible was believed to be thermal conduction caused by the steep temperature gradients between the high - temperature flare plasma and the cool , underlying chromosphere @xcite .",
    "this was also motiviated by the fact that power - law spectra are not observed during the decay phase of the majority of solar flares .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the first observational evidence for gentle evaporation due to nonthermal electrons during the impulsive phase of a solar flare as predicted by current theoretical models",
    ". upflows of 13@xmath516 , 16@xmath517 , and 110@xmath558  km  s@xmath4 as seen in the , , and lines , respectively , result from a beam of non - thermal electrons with a flux value of @xmath05@xmath110@xmath2  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath4 . from paper",
    "i , we reported that an order of magnitude higher flux ( @xmath04@xmath110@xmath7  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath4 ) gives rise to downflows of @xmath935 and @xmath945  km  s@xmath4 in the and lines , and upflows of @xmath9270  km  s@xmath4 in the line .",
    "as a consequence , the findings reported here and in paper i support the theoretical models which predict that the response of the solar chromosphere is sensitively dependent on the flux of accelerated nonthermal electrons .",
    "our results also support the prediction that there exists a threshold value for the nonthermal electron flux above which the chromosphere can not efficiently radiate the deposited energy .",
    "@xcite proposed that this threshold value is @xmath93@xmath110@xmath7  ergs  @xmath3  s@xmath4 . above this value ,",
    "electron fluxes were shown to begin to drive chromospheric condensation , a process resulting from the high pressures reached by the rapidly expanding evaporated material .",
    "the combination of the results presented here and in paper i also lend very strong evidence to support this principle .",
    "the recent hydrodynamic simulations of @xcite and @xcite have been developed to include more realistic electron beam parameters and a non - lte treatment of the solar atmosphere .",
    "these more detailed calculations still provide the distinction between gentle and explosive evaporation for differing nonthermal electron fluxes .",
    "these models will be further developed to include higher temperature plasmas that will be observed by the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis ) on board _ solar - b _ , due for launch in late 2006 . by combining eis observations with _",
