    "while random graph theory and scale - free network research know a set of standard measures to quantify their properties , the question of _ complexity _ of a graph still is in its infancies . a ` blind ' application of other complexity measures ( as for binary sequences or computer programs ) does not account for the special properties shared by graphs and especially scale - free graphs .",
    "moreover , some known complexity measures themselves have a high computational complexity . + since a series of seminal papers ( watts & strogatz @xcite , barabasi & albert @xcite @xcite , newman @xcite , dorogovtsev & mendes @xcite ) since 1999 ( see also @xcite for an overview ) , small - world and scale - free networks are a hot topic of investigation in a broad range of systems and disciplines .",
    "metabolic and other biological networks , collaboration networks , www , internet , etc .",
    ", have in common that the distribution of link degrees follows a power law , thus has no inherent scale .",
    "such networks are termed ` scale - free networks ' .",
    "compared to random graphs , which have a poisson link distribution and thus a characteristic scale , they share a lot of different properties , especially a high clustering coefficient , and a short average path length .",
    "+ mathematically , a graph ( or synonymously in this context , a network ) is defined by a ( nonempty ) set of nodes , a set of edges ( or links ) , and a map that assigns two nodes ( the `` end nodes '' of a link ) to each link . in a computer , a graph may be represented either by a list of links , represented by the pairs of nodes , or equivalently , by its adjacency matrix @xmath0 whose entries are 1 ( 0 ) if nodes @xmath1 are connected ( disconnected ) .",
    "useful generalizations are weighted graphs , where the restriction of @xmath0 is relaxed from binary values to ( unsually nonnegative ) integer or real values ( e.g.  resistor values , travel distances , interaction coupling ) , and directed graphs , where @xmath0 no longer needs to be symmetric , and the link from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and the link from @xmath3 to @xmath2 can exist independently ( e.g.  links between webpages , or scientific citations ) . + here",
    "the discussion will be kept limited to binary undirected graphs , like an acquaintancy network or a railway network as shown below . in the following sections the link ( degree ) distribution and the next order cross - distribution",
    "are investigated and taken as a basis for a complexity measure .",
    "for text strings ( as computer programs , or dna ) there are common complexity measures in theoretical computer science , as _ kolmogorov complexity _",
    "( and the related _ lempel - ziv complexity _ and _ algorithmic information content _ aic ) @xcite . e.g. , aic is defined by the length of the shortest program generating the string . for random structures , thus also for random graphs , they indicate high complexity .",
    "a distinction of complex structured ( but still partly random ) structures from completely random ones usually is prohibitive for this class of measures . for this reason , measures of _ effective complexity _ @xcite have been discussed ; usually these are defined as an entropy ( or description length ) of `` a concise description of a set of the entity s regularities '' @xcite .",
    "here we are mainly interested in this second class , and straightforwardly one would try to apply existing measures , e.g. , to the link list or to the adjacency matrix . however , mathematically it is not straightforward to apply these text string based measures to graphs , as there is no unique way to map a graph onto a text string . for the case of hierarchical structures , which can be represented by trees , ceccatto and huberman",
    "quantified complexity from the diversity of the subtrees @xcite .",
    "as natural networks typically exhibit an occurrence triangles and higher oder loops in a nonneglectable way , other approaches have to be chosen for networks in general .",
    "thus one desires to use complexity measures that are defined directly for graphs .",
    "two classical measures are known from graph theory , _ graph thickness _ and _ coloring number _ have a low `` resolution '' ( typically integer values up to 4 ) , and their relevance for real networks is not clear .",
    "two new complexity measures recently have been proposed for graphs , _ medium articulation _",
    "@xcite for weighted graphs ( as they appear in foodwebs ) and a measure for directed graphs by meyer - ortmanns @xcite based on the _ network motif _ concept @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the latter two complexity measures are computationally quite costly .",
    "a computational complexity approach has been defined by machta and machta @xcite as _ computational depth _ of an _ ensemble of graphs _ ( e.g.  small - world , scalefree , lattice ) .",
    "it is defined as the number of processing time steps a large parallel computer ( with unlimited number of processors ) would need to generate a _ representative _ member of that graph ensemble .",
    "unlike other approaches , it does not assign single complexity values to each graph , and again is nontrivial to compute .",
    "following @xcite , an especially desired property of a complexity measure should be the ability to distinguish nonrandom complex structures from both pure randomness and regular structures as lattices . in this instance , the effective complexity and the machta approach fulfill this prerequisites perfectly , but up to today no simple method is available to compute them .",
    "hence , a _ simpler estimator _ of graph complexity is desired , and one possible approach , the offdiagonal complexity , is proposed here .",
    "it is motivated by a striking observation on the node - node link correlation matrices of complex networks @xcite , namely that entries are more evenly spread among the offdiagonals , compared to both regular lattices and random graphs ( see figs .",
    "[ fignoncomplex ] and [ figcomplex ] for a comparison ) .",
    "this can be used to a complexity measure , for undirected graphs @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_motivationodc ] the approach is motivated from link entropies and node - node correlations . in sec .",
    "[ sec_odcdef ] odc is defined .",
    "section [ sec_helico ] investigates the application of odc to a protein interaction network , compared with randomized surrogates .",
    "a straightforward mathematical approach to study node - node link correlations , i.e.  correlations between degrees of pairs of nodes , is to use rank correlation methods @xcite from classical statistics to analyze the link distributions .",
    "two common rank correlation methods can be described as follows .",
    "one considers a list of _ rank numbers _ of link numbers ( node degrees ) . for each of the two graphs ( a and b ) to be compared",
    ", there is a ( ordered ) list of link numbers @xmath4 , and one assigns a rank number to each link , @xmath5 ( 1 2.5 2.5 5 5 5 ) .",
    "hereby the identical second and third ranks are replaced by the ( noninteger ) average value ; as node degrees are highly degenerate , this will occur frequently .",
    "then the kendall tau coefficient is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 , if pairs of elements @xmath8 are ranked in both lists equally ( resp .",
    "non equally ) , + @xmath9 .",
    "its apparent drawbacks within this context are the required costly computations ( @xmath10 ) , and it seems to be analytically not easy to handle , as one must have the nodes sorted by their degree , for each member of ( e.g. ) an ensemble average .    the second main rank correlation method is spearman s rho , defined by @xmath11 where @xmath12  some of its properties are : + @xmath13   for _ identical _ rank lists    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      +",
    "let @xmath14 be the adjacency matrix of a graph with @xmath15 nodes , i.e. , @xmath16 if nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 are connected , else @xmath17 .",
    "then odc is defined as follows @xcite .",
    "+ ( i ) for each node @xmath2 , let @xmath18 be the node degree , i.e.  the number of edges ( links ) , + @xmath19 + ( ii ) let @xmath20 be the number of edges between al pairs of nodes @xmath2 and @xmath3 , with node degrees @xmath21 , @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( ordered pairs ) , i.e. , + @xmath24 + here @xmath25 is the kronecker symbol and @xmath26 for @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 . due to the pair odering , the matrix @xmath20 has entries only on the main diagonal and above .",
    "thus , @xmath20 is a ( not normalized ) node - node link correlation matrix .",
    "+ ( iii ) summation over the minor diagonals , or offdiagonals , i.  e.   all pairs with same @xmath30 up to @xmath31 , and normalization , @xmath32 + ( iv ) then odc is defined as an entropy measure on this normalized distributions ( here it is understood that @xmath33 ) , + @xmath34    odc is an approximative complexity estimator that takes as values zero for a regular lattice ( an orthogonal @xmath35-dimensional lattice with periodic boundaries consists of bulk nodes with @xmath36 neighbors . thus @xmath37 is the only entry ; for this regular structure odc vanishes . also a 2-dimensional hexagonal lattice has only one entry ) , zero for a fully connected graph , low values for a random graph , and higher values for ` apparently complex ' structures .",
    "one main advantage is that it does not involve costly ( high - order or np - complete ) computations .",
    "to demonstrate that odc can distinguish between random graphs and complex networks , the helicobacter pylori protein interaction graph @xcite has been chosen . for different rewiring probabilities",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 realizations each , the links have been reshuffled , ending up with a random graph for @xmath40 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ helico ] , rewiring in any case lowers the offdiagonal complexity .",
    "a new complexity measure for graphs and networks has been proposed .",
    "the motivation of its definition is twofold : one observation is that the binning of link distributions is problematic for small networks .",
    "herefrom the second observation is that if one uses instead of the ( plain ) entropy of link distribution , which is unsignificant for scale - free networks , a `` biased link entropy '' , it has an extremum where the exponent of the power law is met .",
    "+ the central idea of odc is to apply an entropy measure to the degree correlation matrix , after summation over the offdiagonals .",
    "this allows for a quantitative , yet still approximative , measure of complexity .",
    "odc roughly is ` hierarchy sensitive ' and has the main advantage of being computationally not costly ."
