    "muon spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) technique [ 1 - 3 ] has made significant contributions to studies of high-@xmath2 superconductors ( htsc ) .",
    "measurements in transverse - fields ( tf-@xmath0sr ) provide a reliable way to determine the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath1 of type - ii superconductors and to infer details of the flux vortex lattice , while measurements in zero - filed ( zf-@xmath0sr ) allow studies of static magnetism , leading to determination of the phase diagrams , local spin structures , and volume fraction of static magnetism . in this article",
    ", we provide a perspective view on development of these measurements in htsc systems and their implications on condensation mechanisms , heterogeneity and phase diagrams , focusing on the behavior of @xmath3 ( superconducting carrier density / effective mass ) .",
    "since the parameter @xmath3 in htsc systems plays a role similar to the superfluid density in superfluid he systems , we refer to it as `` superfluid density '' in the title and the text of this paper .    in the following section , section ii , we start with the results of the penetration depth measurements of hole - doped cuprate systems , which exhibit universal correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we discuss these correlations in terms of energy scales of superconducting carriers .",
    "then , we look into the cases involving heterogeneity , i.e. , ( cu , zn ) substitution and overdoping in section iii , and systems with coexisting superconductivity and static magnetism , with the formation of magnetic nano - islands , in section iv . in all these cases ,",
    "the superfluid density has a trade - off with the volume of non - superconducting regions created by perturbation and/or phase separation .",
    "we shall see that the universal correlations between @xmath2 and the superfluid density @xmath3 are followed not only by the simple hole doped cuprates but also by these htsc systems with microscopic phase separation .",
    "thin films of superfluid @xmath4he and @xmath4he/@xmath5he mixtures represent another set of systems where the superfluid transition temperature @xmath2 is strongly correlated with the superfluid density . in section",
    "v , we compare the results of htsc systems with superfluid he films in normal and porous media .    based on the correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the pseudogap phenomena in the underdoped region , some models / conjectures have been presented in terms of the condensation mechanisms of htsc systems . to elucidate these models , in section",
    "vi , we will first consider differences and similarities among bose - einstein ( be ) condensation , bcs condensation and kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition .",
    "then , we will compare models of be - bcs crossover and phase fluctuations , taking into account relevance to the kt transition and distinction between pair - formation and dynamic superconductivity in the pseudo - gap regime .",
    "we will also introduce a phase diagram involving phase separation in the overdoped region in section vii , followed by a summary in section viii .",
    "in type - ii superconductors , the external magnetic field , between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , forms a lattice of flux vortices , resulting in inhomogeneous internal field distributions .",
    "the width of this distribution is proportional to the muon spin relaxation rate @xmath13 in tf-@xmath0sr , which is related to the penetration depth @xmath1 and @xmath3 as @xmath14 \\times   [ 1/(1+\\xi/{\\it l\\/})]\\eqno{(1)},\\ ] ] as given by the london equation . in superconducting systems in the clean limit , where the coherence length @xmath15 is much shorter than the mean free path _",
    "l _ , the relaxation rate @xmath13 is proportional to @xmath3 .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the internal field is due to partial screening of the external field by the supercurrent .",
    "so , it is quite natural that the field width and @xmath13 are proportional to the `` supercurrent density '' @xmath3 , in the same sense as the conductivity of normal metals is proportional to @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the normal state carrier density",
    ".    generally , tf-@xmath0sr studies in type - ii superconductors provide information on : ( a ) the temperature dependence of @xmath1 ; ( b ) absolute values of @xmath1 at @xmath18 ; ( c ) the coherence length @xmath15 via analyses of local field distribution ; and ( d ) vortex lattice properties . among these , use of single crystal specimens is essential in ( a ) , ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "for example , early @xmath0sr results of @xmath1 on ceramic samples of htsc systems mostly exhibited behavior consistent with isotropic energy gap , and it is only after studies of high - quality single crystal specimens that the d - wave nature was confirmed in temperature dependence of @xmath1 . for details of ( a ) , ( c ) and",
    "( d ) , readers are referred to refs .",
    "[ 3 - 4 ] .",
    "in contrast , the results on ceramic specimens have been very useful in comparing absolute values of @xmath3 in different systems .",
    "ceramic specimens provide advantages over single crystal specimens in homogeneity of doped hole concentrations and in being less affected by crossover from the 3-d to 2-d vortex lattice . in this article",
    ", we shall focus on the system and doping dependence of the superfluid density , i.e. , ( b ) . in htsc systems with a large anisotropy , the relaxation rate @xmath13 measured in ceramic specimens",
    "is determined predominantly by the supercurrent flowing in the conducting ab - planes [ 5 ] .",
    "thus , the results of @xmath13 from ceramic specimens should be regarded as reflecting the in - plane penetration depth @xmath19 and the in - plane effective mass @xmath20 .",
    "figure 1 shows a plot of @xmath21 versus @xmath2 of various different htsc systems [ 6 - 11 ] . in this figure ,",
    "results from simple hole - doped htsc systems [ 6,7 ] are shown with open symbols .",
    "with increasing hole concentration , @xmath2 increases linearly with @xmath3 in the underdoped region , and then shows a saturation .",
    "the slope of this linear relationship in the underdoped region is common to various different series of htsc systems .",
    "these results have also been confirmed in several other @xmath0sr measurements [ 12 - 16 ] .",
    "this observation alone already implies that @xmath3 can be an important determining factor for @xmath2 in htsc systems .",
    "we also find in fig .",
    "1 that the ratios of @xmath2 versus @xmath3 for some other superconductors [ 17,18 ] are not quite far from the value for htsc systems .",
    "if an independent estimate for the effective mass @xmath22 is available , the @xmath0sr measurements give the superconducting carrier density @xmath23 .",
    "then , one can calculate the number of carries existing in a region of coherence length squared on the conducting plane . for typical bcs superconductors , such as sn or pb , one finds more than 10,000 pairs overlapping with one another in the @xmath24 area .",
    "for superfluid he , which is the well - known case for bose - einstein condensation , we find that each boson exist without overlapping with each other : i.e. , one pair per @xmath24 .",
    "the systems following the linear relationship in fig . 1 have 3 to 6 pairs overlapping within the @xmath24 area , as illustrated in fig .",
    "2 . this feature encourages us to consider htsc and some novel superconductors in a crossover from be to bcs condensation .    by knowing the average distance @xmath25 between the conducting cuo@xmath26 planes , one can obtain @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the 2-dimensional carrier density .",
    "we remind here that the fermi energy @xmath29 of 2-dimensional electron gas is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "thus , we can consider @xmath27 as a parameter representing kinetic energy for translational motion of superconducting carries .",
    "for 3-d systems without phase separation , in which @xmath31 , one can combine the muon relaxation rate @xmath32 with the sommerfeld constant @xmath33 , or pauli susceptibility @xmath34 , to deduce @xmath35 .",
    "the `` effective '' fermi energy @xmath29 obtained in this way does not necessarily correspond to the real fermi energy in band structure calculations . since @xmath36 corresponds to the drude spectral weight in optical conductivity which condenses into a delta function at @xmath37 below @xmath2 , @xmath29",
    "might also be called as a drude energy scale .",
    "figure 3 shows a plot of @xmath2 versus @xmath38 thus obtained from the results of @xmath3 [ 7 ] . for a@xmath9c@xmath10 where a reliable value of _ l _ is not available",
    ", we used the clean - limit value of @xmath3 without corrections regarding @xmath15/_l _ [ 17,18 ] .",
    "we find that htsc , organic bedt [ 19 ] , and some other systems [ 17 - 20 ] have very high and nearly equal ratios of @xmath39 .",
    "the @xmath40 line in this figure shows the bose - einstein condensation temperature for a non - interacting 3-d bose gas having the boson density @xmath41 and mass @xmath42 .",
    "compared to @xmath40 , the actual transition temperatures @xmath2 of htsc systems are reduced by a factor of 4 to 5 .",
    "this reduction is natural in view of overlapping pairs which would reduce @xmath2 , and in view of 2-dimensional character of htsc systems .",
    "however the parallel behavior of @xmath40 and the observed results of @xmath2 suggests that the origin of the linear relationship between @xmath2 and @xmath3 could be deeply related to be condensation .",
    "figure 3 serves as an empirical way to classify various superconductors in a crossover from be to bcs condensation .",
    "when a very small amount of zn is substituted for cu on the cuo@xmath26 planes of htsc systems , @xmath2 is reduced .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the reduction of @xmath21 as a function of zn concentration @xmath43 substituting in - plane cu . the superfluid density @xmath3 decreases with increasing @xmath43 .",
    "to account for this reduction , we proposed `` swiss cheese model '' [ 9 ] where each zn is assumed to destroy superconductivity in the surrounding region with the area @xmath44 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "4(a ) , which represent predictions of this model , are obtained just from @xmath43 and @xmath45 deduced from the upper critical field @xmath12 , _ without any fitting _ to the data .",
    "sufficiently good agreement between these lines and the observed results indicate that carriers within the @xmath44 area around each zn no longer contribute to the superfluid density @xmath3 .",
    "subsequently , this picture was directly confirmed by pan et al . [ 21 ] in scanning tunneling microscopy studies , where the local density of states around zn showed features characteristic to normal regions , as shown in fig .",
    "these @xmath0sr and stm results are consistent with the non - zero @xmath46 term of the specific heat , which increases with increasing zn concentration [ 22 ] . in the plot of @xmath13 versus @xmath2 in fig .",
    "1 , the results of zn - doped systems ( closed triangle and star symbols ) follow the trajectory of simple hole doped htsc systems ( open symbols )",
    ".      tl@xmath26ba@xmath26cuo@xmath47 ( tl2201 ) systems have been extensively studied by various experimental methods as a prototype of overdoped htsc systems .",
    "tl2201 compounds have very small residual resistivity , which assures that the system lies well within the clean limit . to our surprise , with increasing overdoping from the nearly optimal @xmath2 = 85 k sample , the relaxation rate @xmath21 in tf-@xmath0sr decreased [ 8,15 ] as shown by the closed circle symbols in fig .",
    "this behavior is also shown in a plot of @xmath21 versus doping factor @xmath48 in fig .",
    "in view of no anomaly in @xmath22 , the different behaviors of the normal state carriers @xmath17 and the superfluid density @xmath3 suggest that carriers are spontaneously separated into those which are involved in superconductivity and those which remain unpaired fermions , as illustrated in fig .",
    "5(a ) .    by defining the `` gapped '' and `` ungapped '' responses in the specific heat measurements ,",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "5(a ) , we plotted the @xmath48 dependence of the gapped response obtained from the data of loram _ et al .",
    "_ [ 22 ] in tl2201 in fig .",
    "the good agreement between the @xmath0sr superfluid density @xmath21 ( closed circles ) and the `` gapped '' response in specific heat ( open symbols ) provides a support to our view [ 8,23 ] with spontaneous phase separation between superconducting and normal regions in overdoped htsc systems .",
    "the volume fraction of the superconducting region can also be estimated from the `` specific heat jump '' @xmath49 . in bcs superconductors",
    "@xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the normal - state specific heat , and @xmath52 stands for the sommerfeld constant derived in the normal state . then , in the plot of @xmath53 versus @xmath54 as in the inset of fig .",
    "5(a ) , one would expect that the specific heat jump @xmath55 should be independent of @xmath2 , for systems having a common @xmath52 value . in loram s specific heat results of tl2201 [ 22 ] ,",
    "@xmath52 does not depend on doping , while the jump @xmath55 decreases with increasing doping .",
    "this observation further supports decreasing superfluid volume fraction with increasing doping ( decreasing @xmath2 ) in tl2201 .",
    "residual normal response in the overdoped cuprate was also found in measurements of optical conductivity [ 24 ] .",
    "furthermore , we calculated an expected doping dependence of @xmath3 based on a simple model assuming phase separation [ 23 ] ( as described in section vii ) , and obtained a good agreement with the observed results in ( y , ca)ba@xmath26cu@xmath9o@xmath56 [ 25 ] , as shown in fig .",
    "so far , there is no direct observation reported regarding the size of these phase - separated regions in overdoped htsc .",
    "magnetic order of the parent compound la@xmath26cuo@xmath57 of the 214 cuprates was first confirmed by zf-@xmath0sr measurements [ 26 ] .",
    "figure 6(a ) shows the time spectra obtained in the zf measurements of antiferromagnetic la@xmath26cuo@xmath57 ( af - lco ) which has the n/eel temperature @xmath58 k. as in most other magnetic systems , we find that muon spin precession sets in below @xmath59 , with the precession amplitude independent of temperature , while the frequency increasing with decreasing temperature as the sub - lattice magnetization builds up . in the la214 systems with the hole concentration near 1/8 per cu ,",
    "incommensurate static spin correlations have been found by neutron scattering [ 27 ] .",

    "in this case , we find a bessel function line shape characteristic of zf-@xmath0sr in incommensurate magnetic systems [ 29,30 ] , such as the one observed in ( tmtsf)@xmath26pf@xmath62 [ 29 ] .",
    "la@xmath26cuo@xmath63 ( lco:4.11 ) is a system with oxygen intercalated in a stage-4 structure .",
    "this system is superconducting with @xmath2 = 42 k , which is the highest among the la214 family , while also exhibiting static incommensurate magnetism below @xmath59 = 42 k [ 31 ] this incommensurate modulation has a very long correlation length ( @xmath64  ) , as determined from a very sharp satellite magnetic bragg peak in neutron scattering results .",
    "zf-@xmath0sr spectra of this system [ 10,32 ] , shown in fig .",
    "6(c ) , has a bessel - function line shape , as expected for an incommensurate spin structure .",
    "the amplitude of this precession , however , increases gradually below @xmath59 with decreasing temperature , while the frequency is almost independent of temperature below @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , the amplitude of precessing signal at @xmath65 is less than half of that in lbco:0.125 ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) , which indicates that the static magnetism exists in less than a half of the total volume .    in fig .",
    "7(a ) and ( b ) , we show temperature dependences of the volume fraction @xmath66 of muons in the region with static magnetic freezing , derived from the precession amplitude , and the frequency @xmath67 observed in lco:4.11 , ( la@xmath68sr@xmath69)cuo@xmath57 ( lsco:0.12 ) , lbco:0.125 and ( la@xmath70nd@xmath71sr@xmath61)cuo@xmath57 ( lnsco:0.125 ) [ 33 ] . in lco:4.11 and lsco:0.12 , where superconductivity coexists with static magnetism ,",
    "the static magnetism is confined to a partial volume fraction . as shown in fig .",
    "7(c ) , the temperature dependence of the neutron bragg intensity in lco:4.11 is consistent with the behavior of @xmath72 . unlike usual magnetic systems , however , the @xmath54 dependence is mostly due to the change of the volume fraction @xmath66 .",
    "the internal field at the muon site in htsc systems is due to dipolar field from neighbouring static cu spins .",
    "depending on the range of this field , the volume fraction of muons @xmath66 subject to static field is somewhat larger than the volume fraction @xmath73 of frozen cu spins . figure 8(a ) shows our simulation results for the relationship between @xmath73 and @xmath66 for cases with incommensurate static magnetism in island regions having a radius @xmath74 [ 10 ] . here",
    "we see that about 70 - 80%  population of static cu spins is enough to create observable static fields at the sites of all the muons .",

    "although the relationship between @xmath66 and @xmath73 is nearly independent of the radius @xmath74 of static sdw islands , the damping rate @xmath79 of the bessel oscillation depends on @xmath74 , as shown in fig .",
    "8(b ) . by converting observed @xmath66 into @xmath73 using fig .",
    "8(a ) , and then plotting observed @xmath79 in fig .",

    "this model of `` static sdw nano islands '' can be reconciled with the long range spin correlations found by neutron bragg peaks , if we consider percolation of these islands via a help of interplaner correlations , as proposed in [ 10 ] .    to study the relationship between the magnetic volume fraction @xmath73 and the superfluid density @xmath3 , we performed @xmath0sr measurements in ( la@xmath81eu@xmath56sr@xmath76)cuo@xmath57 ( lesco ) [ 11,34 ] where the concentration of doped hole carriers is fixed to 0.15 per cu , while the magnetic volume changes with increasing eu concentration @xmath82 .",
    "the volume fraction with static magnetism was determined by the zf-@xmath0sr , while @xmath3 was measured in tf-@xmath0sr .",
    "the results shown in fig . 9 clearly demonstrate a trade - off between @xmath73 and the superfluid density @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that superconductivity does not exist in the volume which has static magnetism .    in the plot of @xmath21 versus @xmath2 in fig .",
    "1 , the results of these systems with static stripe magnetism , shown by the striped square symbols , follow the trajectory of simple hole - doped and zn - doped systems .",
    "this indicates that @xmath3 is again a determining factor of @xmath2 in htsc systems where superconductivity and magnetism coexist .",
    "we also note that the results in overdoped tl2201 can be viewed as following a monotonic relationship between @xmath2 and the superfluid density , with the slope roughly comparable to cuprates with / without other types of perturbations .",

    "the results on mylar films show linear relationship , consistent with the behavior expected for the kt transition [ 40 ] ( see next section for details ) as indicated by the solid line . with the lowest level of perturbation",
    ", this case corresponds to simple hole - doped htsc systems in comparison between the cuprates and he films .",
    "the results on vycor glass is analogous to the zn - doped cuprates : in both cases some normal regions are formed as a `` healing region / layer '' , while @xmath2 is still strongly correlated with the superfluid density despite non - trivial geometry of the superfluid .",

    ", the mixture undergoes macroscopic phase separation into @xmath4he - rich superfluid and @xmath5he - rich normal fluid , the heavier superfluid existing underneath the lighter normal fluid in a container .",
    "this phase separation can be confined into a microscopic length scale by adsorbing the mixture onto porous media or fine powders [ 39,41 ] , where superfluidity remains up to a large @xmath5he fraction .",

    "1 [ 6 ] . by combining this phenomenon with the pseudogap behavior then observed by nmr and conductivity , we proposed a picture of be to bcs crossover in 1993 - 94 [ 47,48 ] , as illustrated in fig .",
    "14(a ) [ 42,47,48 ] .",
    "general concept of the be - bcs crossover has been considered earlier by several scientists [ 49 ] , including randeria and co - workers [ 50 ] who adopted this concept to the interpretation of the susceptibility / nmr results for the pseudo gap . within our knowledge , however , our proposal was the first to combine the results of superfluid density with the pseudogap behavior in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "14(a ) , we regarded the pseudogap temperature @xmath6 as the pair formation temperature @xmath84 .",
    "the reduction of the c - axis dc conductivity below @xmath6 can be interpreted as resulting from reduced interplaner tunneling probability for paired bosonic carriers having 2e charges , while reduction of magnetic susceptibility can be attributed to the formation of a spin singlet bosonic ( pairing ) state in this picture .    in 1995 ,",
    "emery and kivelson ( ek ) [ 51 ] proposed a model based on phase fluctuations , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the be - bcs model and the phase fluctuation model share many features in common .",
    "however , there are several important differences",
    ". based on the linear relationship between @xmath2 and the superfluid density at @xmath65 , ek presented arguments basically parallel to that for the kt transition in 2-d systems .",
    "they pointed out that @xmath2 of the underdoped cuprates is determined by the energy scale for the phase fluctuations . in their picture , the entire region of pseudogap below @xmath6 is characterized by phase fluctuations .",
    "they argued that the 2-dimensional aspect is essential for obtaining high @xmath2 .    in order to calculate @xmath112 which denotes the energy scale for phase fluctuations to destroy superconductivity , ek multiplied @xmath113 to the interplaner distance @xmath25 for htsc and some other 2-d systems .",
    "this is equivalent of obtaining @xmath114 in 2-d . for 3-d systems ,",
    "ek multiplied @xmath3 and the coherence length @xmath15 , which leads to an energy scale much higher than @xmath115 .",
    "this energy scale is unrealistically high , and irrelevant to condensation arguments .",
    "if one substitutes the interparticle distance @xmath116 instead of @xmath15 , we recover @xmath115 for 3-d systems .",
    "then , table 1 in ref [ 51 ] by ek becomes essentially equivalent to fig .",
    "3 of our 1991 paper [ 7 ] , shown as a part of fig . 3 of this article , where we plotted @xmath2 versus @xmath115 .",
    "we consider that the distinction between 2-d and 3-d systems by ek is an artefact resulting from the overestimate of @xmath112 in 3-d systems . in general , the 2-dimensional aspect does not help increasing @xmath2 of any superconductor , as can be found in fig . 13 .",
    "figure 15 shows the current estimates of @xmath6 from various methods as plotted versus hole concentration .",
    "if the entire region below @xmath6 is supposed to have superconducting phase fluctuations , as conjectured by ek , the situation is rather similar to a thin - film bcs superconductor shown in fig .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath6 is solely representing the pair formation , as proposed in our be - bcs crossover picture , and if there is a 2-dimensional aspect remaining in htsc systems , there should be two different energy scales above @xmath2 , as we discussed in ref [ 35 ] .",
    "they are the temperature @xmath8 at which the phase coherence of bosons completely disappear and dynamic superconductivity vanishes , in addition to the temperature @xmath84 at which pairs are dissolved into fermions .",
    "this situation is similar to the case of he films shown in fig .",
    "one of important differences between be - bcs and ek conjectures lies in this point .",
    "since high-@xmath2 cuprates have a highly 2-dimensional electronic structure , several experiments have detected the `` dynamic superconductivity '' existing above @xmath2 : ( 1 ) in ybco - pbco films with a thick pbco layers separating a single layer ybco , @xmath2 is reduced to 15 - 20 k. between this temperature and the @xmath117 k of the bulk ybco , one observes reduction of the normal state conductivity , which follows the predictions of the kosterlitz - thouless theory [ 52 ] .",
    "( 2 ) corson _ et al . _",
    "[ 53 ] measured dynamic superfluid response in underdoped bi2212 , and found that the response depends on the measuring frequency @xmath118 above a certain `` branch - off '' temperature @xmath119 , as shown in fig .",
    "furthermore , the superfluid density @xmath3 at @xmath120 agrees well with the universal value @xmath121 expected for the kt transition .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath2 , at which @xmath122 , increases with increasing @xmath118 , suggesting that this phenomenon corresponds to the `` dynamic superfluidity '' expected above @xmath123 and below @xmath8 . it should be noted , however , that @xmath8 for the measuring frequency of 600 ghz is limited to @xmath124 k.    these results indicate that certain cuprate systems with high anisotropy , such as underdoped bi2212 and single - layer ybco film , exhibit dynamic superconductivity as expected from the kt theory .",
    "however , these results do not necessarily provide explanation to the origin of the pseudo gap at @xmath125 , since @xmath8 observed in bi2212 is significantly lower than the pseudo - gap temperature @xmath6 .",
    "namely , the phase fluctuations alone can not explain the entire pseudo - gap phenomena .",
    "dependence to an external magnetic field should be quite different if these two distinct energy scales above @xmath2 correspond respectively to pairing and dynamic superconductivity .",
    "the former would not depend much on external fields , while the latter should be very sensitive to the field .",
    "indeed , the pseudo gap below @xmath6 was found to be insensitive to the applied field in tunneling measurements [ 54 ] .",
    "recently , lavrov _ et al . _",
    "[ 55 ] found that c - axis conductivity shows negative magneto - resistance upon cooling at a temperature well below @xmath6 but above @xmath2 .",
    "this negative magneto - resistance may be due to the onset of dynamic superconductivity below @xmath8 .",
    "the results of the nernst effect [ 56 ] , which appear in the underdoped region of la214 systems above @xmath2 but well below @xmath6 can also be interpreted as possible evidence for dynamic superconductivity below @xmath8 .",
    "other phenomena potentially related to this energy scale include : ( a ) superfluid response of the arpes coherence peak [ 57 ] ; and ( b ) 41 mev neutron resonance mode [ 58 ] .    based on these considerations ,",
    "we propose a new phase diagram , with two distinct lines of @xmath6 and @xmath8 in the underdoped region as shown in fig .",
    "note that the pair formation at @xmath6 is necessary for superconductivity in cuprates , but is not enough to support any phase coherence .",
    "it is only when the thermal energy scale becomes less than the energy scale representing the number density of bosons that the phase coherence can set in .",
    "the onset temperature @xmath8 of dynamic superfluidity represents this energy scale . in highly 2-dimensional cases ,",
    "one should further cool down below @xmath8 before achieving long - range phase coherence at @xmath2 .",
    "in bcs superconductors in the clean limit , all the carriers in the fermi sphere contribute to superfluid . there should be no normal carriers remaining at @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , neither the be - bcs nor the phase fluctuation pictures can explain the reduction of @xmath23 with increasing hole doping observed in several overdoped cuprate systems [ 8,15,25 ] described in section iii - b .",
    "tallon , loram and co - workers [ 59 ] have noticed that the @xmath6 line may be heading towards @xmath126 at a `` critical hole concentration '' around @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath0sr studies of panagopoulos _ et al .",
    "_ [ 60 ] show that static magnetism , either spontaneously existing or induced by zn doping , disappears at @xmath128 .",
    "generally , increasing hole doping would tend to destroy magnetic interactions in the cuprates .",
    "let us make the following three assumptions : ( a ) the paring in htsc systems is due to a magnetic interaction ; ( b ) the @xmath6 line represents the pair formation , and ( c ) the @xmath6 line disappears at @xmath129 .",
    "then , no genuine superconducting pairing exists in the overdoped region at @xmath128 .",
    "however , if the energy loss for charge disproportionation is overcome by the gain of pairing and condensation energies , the system can spontaneously phase separate into a `` hole - poor '' superfluid with the local hole concentration @xmath130 and a `` hole - rich '' normal fermion region with @xmath131 .",
    "if this phase separation remains microscopic with the length scale comparable to @xmath45 , we can expect superconductivity in the overdoped region , similarly to the case of @xmath4he/@xmath5he mixture .",
    "the energy loss of charge disproportionation can be estimated following coulomb blockade type calculation and/or formation of nano - islands serving as capacitor allays .",
    "our crude estimate [ 23 ] shows that this energy becomes comparable to paring / condensation energy gain in the cuprates .",
    "based on these considerations , we proposed a phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "17 , with phase separation in the overdoped region . as shown in fig .",
    "5(b ) , the doping evolution of the superfluid density @xmath23 , calculated using this model [ 23 ] , shows a good qualitative agreement with the observed results .",
    "we also note that this model can reproduce a very sharp temperature dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath12 at @xmath65 found in the heavily overdoped region of tl2201 [ 8,15,61 ] .",
    "tallon and loram [ 59 ] presented a view that the existence of superconductivity in the overdoped cuprates at @xmath128 , where the @xmath6 line does not exist , implies that the magnetic interaction below the @xmath6 line is not required for superconductivity but rather is a competing factor which weakens superconductivity .",
    "the present model with phase separation provides an alternative view where the pseudogap phenomena , as a necessary factor ( pair formation ) for superconductivity , can be compatible with superconductivity in the overdoped cuprates .      in htsc cuprates , as well as in 2-d organic ( bedt - ttf)@xmath26-x and 3-d a@xmath9c@xmath10 superconductors , superconductivity appears in the vicinity of the insulator to metal transition .",
    "superconductivity is taken over by a presumably fermi - liquid metallic state by increasing carrier doping in cuprates , or by application of chemical and/or external pressure in bedt and a@xmath9c@xmath10 .",
    "in all these cases , we expect that the normal state spectral density ( or drude weight ) @xmath16 to increase in the process towards a simple fermi liquid .",
    "we showed that the superconducting spectral weight _ decreases _ in this process for the case of cuprates .",
    "we performed magnetization measurements of the in - plane penetration depth in ( bedt - ttf)@xmath26cu(ncs)@xmath26 under applied pressure [ 62 ] , and found that @xmath3 decreases with increasing pressure as shown in fig .",
    "18(a ) , contrary to the behavior of @xmath16 found in quantum oscillation measurements [ 63 ] .",
    "this system is known to be well in the clean limit .",
    "these results indicate that not only in cuprates but also in bedt , the crossover from superconducting to metallic ground state is associated with anomalous reduction of the superfluid spectral weight .    similar behavior is also seen in a@xmath9c@xmath10 systems . as shown in fig . 1 and fig .",
    "18(b ) , the muon relaxation rate @xmath132 measured in a@xmath9c@xmath10 decreases with decreasing lattice constant [ 17,18 ] , in the approach towards a simple metallic state . in view of rather large residual resistivity in the normal state , the results for these fullerides might be subject to correction related to the mean free path .",
    "however , the un - corrected raw data indicate that @xmath36 again shows anomalous reduction when the system approaches presumably a simple metallic ground state .",
    "these three systems exhibit similar phase diagrams : superconductivity appears in the evolution from magnetic and insulating ground state to presumably simple fermi liquid state ; in bedt systems , a pseudo - gap like behavior near the magnetic phase was found in susceptibility .",
    "these features suggest a possibility that the anomalous results in the overdoped cuprates may be a generic behavior shared by a wider range of superconductors based on correlated electron systems .",
    "we note that all these systems follow the universal linear relationship in the plot of @xmath2 versus @xmath3 , with approximately the same slope as shown in fig . 1 and in ref .",
    "in this paper , we showed that @xmath2 in htsc cuprate systems exhibits universal correlations with the superfluid spectral weight @xmath3 , for the cases of simple hole doping , as well as for more complicated cases with zn - doping , overdoping and static sdw nano island formation , where the system undergoes spontaneous phase separation between superconducting and normal regions with the length scale comparable to the in - plane coherence length .",
    "robustness of this relation for the case with / without perturbation is analogous to the case of superfluid @xmath4he and @xmath4he/@xmath5he mixture films in non - porous and porous media . in all these cases ,",
    "the superfluid density is the determining factor for @xmath2 .",
    "this is the basic feature of be condensation .    by slightly revising the",
    "be - bcs crossover picture , we have proposed a new phase diagram for the cuprates which has ( a ) two separate lines of @xmath6 and @xmath8 above @xmath2 in the pseudogap state in the underdoped region , ( b ) disappearance of the @xmath6 line at the critical hole concentration @xmath133 , and ( c ) phase separation in the overdoped region . in this model ,",
    "the @xmath6 line represents pair formation , whereas the @xmath8 line corresponds to the onset of dynamic superconductivity .",
    "low dimensionality prevents formation of long - range phase coherence between @xmath8 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also noted anomalous reduction of the superfluid spectral weight @xmath3 in the overdoped cuprates as well as in the 2-d organic bedt and 3-d fulleride superconductors , when the system approach simple metallic ground state .",

    "<S> extensive muon spin relaxation ( @xmath0sr ) measurements have been performed to determine the magnetic field penetration depth @xmath1 in high @xmath2 cuprate superconductors with simple hole doping , zn - doping , overdoping , and formation of static sdw nano islands . </S>",
    "<S> system dependence of @xmath3 ( superconducting carrier density / effective mass ) reveals universal correlations between @xmath2 and @xmath3 in all these cases with / without perturbation . </S>",
    "<S> evidence for spontaneous and microscopic phase separation into normal and superconducting regions was obtained in the cases with strong perturbation , i.e. , zn - doping ( swiss cheese model ) , overdoping , and coexisting magnetic and superconducting states ( sdw nano islands ) . the length scale of this heterogeneity is shown to be comparable to the in - plane coherence length . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss implication of these results on condensation mechanisms of htsc systems , resorting to an analogy with pure @xmath4he and @xmath4he/@xmath5he mixture films on regular and porous media , reminding essential features of bose - einstein , bcs and kosterlitz - thouless condensation / transition in 3-d and 2-d systems , and comparing models of be - bcs crossover and phase fluctuations . combining the @xmath0sr results on @xmath3 and the pseudo - gap behavior , </S>",
    "<S> we propose a new phase diagram for htsc , characterized by : ( 1 ) the @xmath6 line that represents pair formation ; ( 2 ) disappearance of this line above the critical hole concentration @xmath7 ; ( 3 ) in the underdoped region between @xmath2 and @xmath6 , there exists another line @xmath8 which corresponds to the onset of dynamic superconductivity with superconducting phase fluctuations ; and ( 4 ) the overdoped region being phase separated between hole - poor superfluid and hole - rich normal fermion metal regions . finally , we elucidate anomalous reduction of superfluid spectral weight in the crossover from superconducting to metallic ground states found not only in overdoped htsc cuprates but also in pressurized organic bedt and a@xmath9c@xmath10 fulleride superconductors .    * superfluid density of high-@xmath2 cuprate systems : implication on condensation mechanisms , heterogeneity and phase diagram * </S>"
