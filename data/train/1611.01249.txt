    "numerical simulations of the formation of milky way - like galaxies based on this scenario ( e.g. , tissera et al .",
    "2014 , and references therein ) predict that the halo of our milky way is expected to comprise at least two diffuse stellar components with differing spatial distributions , chemistry , and kinematics , along with a number of individual over - densities and stellar debris streams . a large body of recent observations of the milky way and external galaxies provide evidence supporting this model . in particular , the milky way s stellar halo has been found to be far from homogeneous ( belokurov et al .",
    "2009 ) , with a metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) that differs between the inner- and outer - halo regions ( carollo et al .",

    "analyses of relatively local samples of halo stars with photometric metallicity determinations ( e.g. , an et al . 2013 , 2015 ) , combined with available proper motions , have also indicated the presence of significant numbers of stars from the outer - halo population at distances within @xmath11 10 kpc of the sun .",

    "2010 ; nissen @xmath12 schuster 2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "since the @xmath8-elements and fe are primarily produced by different stellar progenitors , their relative abundances can provide constraints on the nature of the previous generations of stellar populations , such as the initial mass function ( imf ) , the star formation rate ( sfr ) , and the efficiency of star formation in different environments , all of which affect the production and ejection of these elements to the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "in particular , the @xmath8-elements are synthesized and expelled mainly by massive stars in the pre - supernova and supernova stages ( type ii supernovae , sneii ) , and fe is largely produced and driven out by binaries involving low- and intermediate - mass stars during their last stages of evolution ( type ia supernova , sneia ) .",

    "finally , we summarise our main conlusions in section  6 .",
    "our analysis was performed making use of the dr12 data products for apogee observations taken between september 2011 and july 2014 ( eisenstein et al . 2011 ; nidever et al . 2015",

    ", v , mn , fe , ni ) were determined with the aspcap pipeline ( garca prez et al .",
    "2016 ; holtzman et al .",
    "apogee was designed to explore the principal stellar components of the galaxy , mainly the galactic disk and bulge , but it also observed stars that are members of the galactic halo .",
    "halo stars were targeted following the same general color - cut criteria , @xmath19 as all apogee observations .",
    "halo targets in apogee lie mainly at galactic latitudes b @xmath20 . for further details regarding the target selection in apogee ,",
    "see zasowski et al .",
    "the aim of this work is to evaluate the variation of elemental abundances across the galactic halo , using in situ halo stars out to the largest distances reached by the apogee observations , @xmath21 kpc from the galactic center .",
    "we first remove stars from our sample with unreliable stellar parameters and chemical abundance estimates , taking into account the flags provided in the data files that indicate suspicious aspcap results and/or instrumental issues ( see holtzman et .",
    "al 2015 ) . specifically , we reject those stars in the database for which the star_bad bit flag in the aspcapflag bitmask is set",
    ". this flag warns about stars with unreliable @xmath22 and @xmath23 estimates , bad matches to synthetic spectra in the aspcap analysis , signal - to - noise ratios per pixel in the final combined spectrum lower than 50 , and/or cases in which the spectrum exhibits broad lines likely due to significant stellar rotation .",
    "in addition , we do not consider the spectra of stars with the gridedge_bad flag set in the elemflag bitmask , which correspond to those stars for which the resulting abundance estimate is closer than 1/8th of the grid spacing to the edge of grid ( see garca prez et al . 2016 ) .",
    "finally , we also avoid stars with spectra affected by persistence in the detectors ( which may lead to significant errors in stellar parameters and abundance determination  see section 5.7 in holtzman et al .",
    "2015 ) , by considering only stars that do not have the persist_low , persist_med and persist_high flags set in the starflag bitmask . for more details about apogee flags",
    "we refer the interested reader to the web page http://www.sdss.org / dr12/algorithms / bitmasks/.    besides the selection criteria discussed above , we also apply other restrictions in @xmath22 and @xmath23 that can arise from issues described by holtmann et al .",
    "we only consider stars with estimated @xmath22 > 4000  k , because at cooler temperatures the quality of the aspcap fitting is significantly lower .",
    "the calibration performed to the @xmath23 ferre outputs , by comparing with asteroseismic @xmath23 estimates for stars observed by apogee in the kepler field ( pinsonneault et al .",
    "2014 ) , shows that stars at @xmath24 deviate considerably from asteroseismic gravities ( holtzmann et al . ) .",
    "therefore , they only calibrated data with lower @xmath23 estimates .",
    "thus , we only consider stars with surface gravity estimates in the range @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , we reject stars that were targeted as belonging to open or globular clusters , since we are interested in the chemical analysis of halo field stars ; stars in clusters can exhibit chemical patterns that differ from those observed in field stars ( see , e.g. , lind et al . 2015 ; fernndez - trincado et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "finally , in addition to the existing target selection criteria for apogee observations , we select our halo sample by considering objects with derived distances from the galactic plane @xmath26 kpc .",
    "the resulting sample comprises a total of @xmath27 stars .    in order to check whether our sample comprises only stars belonging to the halo",
    ", we also inspect their kinematics . for this purpose ,",
    "we derive the full space velocities respect to the local standard of rest , @xmath28 , using the radial velocities provided by dr12 and proper motions from ucac4 ( zacharias et al . 2013 ) .",
    "stars with @xmath29 @xmath30 180 @xmath31 are usually considered to belong to the halo .",
    "our sample includes some stars with lower @xmath29 .",
    "it is not clear why some of these stars have such low velocity values .",
    "one possibility is that , at a few kiloparsecs from the sun , the ucac4 proper motions uncertainties are similar or greater than the intrinsic proper motions ( see section 6.3 in bovy et al .",
    "these uncertainties propagates to the derived velocities , introducing large errors .",
    "after having checked that excluding these stars does not significantly impact our results , we have decided to retain them in our sample .",
    "the top panel in figure  1 shows the mdf for our final sample of stars , which is discussed in section 4.1 .",
    "we note that our mdf is in agreement with previous mdfs derived for halo samples ( carollo et al .",
    "2007,2010 ; allende prieto et al .",
    "2014 ; chen et al . 2014 ; an et al . 2013 , 2015 ) , displaying a maximum at [ m / h ] @xmath5 and a secondary peak at lower [ m / h ] ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "we conclude that our sample is comprised almost entirely of bona - fide halo stars .",

    "the basic techniques followed in aspcap for stellar parameter and chemical abundance determination are the same as in the analysis performed by fa15 ",
    "comparison of the observed spectrum with a library of synthetic spectra covering a range of stellar parameters , looking for the parameter combination that returns the lowest @xmath32 .",
    "this comparison is performed using the code ferre ( allende prieto et al .",
    "the analysis proceeds in two steps :    1 .   the stellar parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 are determined from a search fitting the entire available spectral range , and 2 .",
    "individual chemical abundances are derived by searching only in the [ fe / h ] dimension , with the @xmath22 and @xmath23 fixed at the previously determined valuoes , and fitting isolated spectral windows dominated by features of the element of interest .",
    "aspcap includes several improvements , and performs a more refined abundance determination than fa15 .",
    "for instance , the synthetic grid includes separate [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , and [ @xmath8/fe ] dimensions , and the atmospheric models in the synthetic spectra generation are consistent with the variations in c and the @xmath8-elements abundances .",
    "an improved atomic line list is used , and other upgrades ( broadening to account for macroturbulent velocity , etc . ) are considered ( for more details see garca prez et al .",
    "most importantly , the higher s / n ( @xmath33 ) and resolving power ( r @xmath18 ) of apogee spectra allow for an improvement of the accuracy of estimates compared with those obtained from the lower - resolution optical spectra .",
    "the spectral features resolved in the near - infrared h - band also permit the measurement of many more chemical elements .",
    "on the other hand , apogee was designed to observe mainly the galactic disk and bulge .",
    "for this reason , the survey targeted very few halo stars at distances farther than 30 kpc from the sun .",
    "therefore , we can not explore the trends in the most distant regions of the halo investigated in fa15 , which included stars with galactocentric distances beyond 40 kpc .",
    "@xmath34band stellar spectra generally exhibit weaker lines than optical spectra . with a minimum opacity at the transition between the dominance of continuum h@xmath35 bound - free and free - free opacity at about 1.6 @xmath17 m , in the center of the @xmath34band , photons escape from deeper atmospheric layers in the @xmath34band than in the optical spectral of late - type stars .",
    "deeper layers are warmer and produce weaker absorption lines , and @xmath34band transitions tend to have higher excitation , which makes them weaker as well .",
    "fewer and weaker lines , even though they are less dependent on the choice of micro - turbulence , means more limited information in the spectra .",
    "in addition , metal - poor atmospheres have higher gas pressure , increasing the role of line damping , and a reduced opacity enhances departures from local thermodynamical equilibrium .",
    "these effects may limit the accuracy and precision of the apogee abundances for metal - poor stars more than for their solar - metallicity couterparts .    as in fa15",
    ", we would like to evaluate how the individual elemental abundances vary with distance from the galactic center and stellar metallicity . in fa15",
    ", we took our individual iron abundance measurements ( [ fe / h ] ) as an indicator of the metallicity , [ m / h ] , in the stars . in the present paper",
    "we also consider this elemental abundance as the primary estimate of stellar metallicity .",
    "the variation of the iron abundance with respect to the solar value is considered in aspcap as a dimension of the synthetic library .",
    "all the other elements , except c , n , and the @xmath8-elements , change in the same proportion as iron with respect to solar abundances .",
    "aspcap provides two estimates for the iron abundance . on the one hand , an iron abundance measurement ( [ m / h ] )",
    "is obtained from the fit of the entire available apogee spectral range , which includes spectral features from several chemical elements . on the other hand ,",
    "another estimate ( [ fe / h ] ) is derived by seeking the best match in the [ m / h ] dimension , but fitting only spectral windows containing iron lines ( garca prez et al .",
    "both measurements are expected to be quite close to one another .",
    "a systematic over - estimate at low metallicities was detected in holtzman et al .",
    "2015 for both [ m / h ] and [ fe / h ] by comparing with [ fe / h ] measurements from the literature .",
    "consequently , they performed an external calibration to [ m / h ] ( a second - order fit ) that corrects for this effect , but this was not applied to [ fe / h ] .",
    "moreover , each individual element was internally calibrated independently from the others to remove abundance trends with effective temperature in open clusters .    in the case of c ,",
    "n , and the @xmath8-elements , aspcap calculates their variation over fe by directly searching within the library .",
    "we use these quantities when evaluating [ x / fe ] for these elements . for the other elements , we calculate [ x / fe ] ratios from internally - calibrated individual chemical abundances ( including [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "it is not yet clear what might be the cause of the [ fe / h ] systematic deviation at low metallicities , and other individual abundances may be affected as well .",
    "however , ratios in the form [ x / fe ] from measurements with the same systematic deviation cancels this effect .",
    "we are interested in evaluating differences in the behaviours of individual elemental abundances .",
    "the [ m / h ] determination is influenced by the contribution of elements other than iron , which can induce deviation from the true iron abundance .",
    "consequently , the [ x / m ] ratios may not be reliable for our purposes , so we avoid their use in this paper .    additionally , we are interested in evaluating the chemical trends in different metallicity bins .",
    "we choose the calibrated [ m / h ] as our indicator of the global metallicity , because it is corrected for the over - estimation on the metal - poor side .",
    "[ fe / h ] is unsuitable in this case , because it is still affected by the systematic deviation .",
    "considering it to derive trends with metallicity would place metal - poor stars in higher metallicity bins , and the resulting trends would be distorted .",
    "thus , we use internally - calibrated abundance estimates when discussing abundance ratios , but employ the externally - calibrated [ m / h ] to set our metallicity scale .    notice that the analysis in holtzman et al .",
    "( 2015 ) revealed hints of `` some issue that may be affecting the reliability of the aspcap [ ti / h ] abundance '' ; and a large scatter in [ na / h ] and [ v / h ] , which also lead to be aware of the limited precision of these abundance estimates .",
    "for these reasons , we cautiously interpret the resulting trends for these elements .",
    "a number of independent groups have been working on the derivation of distance estimates for apogee stars , which we consider in our present analysis ; these are described in santiago et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , hayden et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , and schultheis et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the derivation of distances for apogee giant stars necessarily involves dealing with stars with a very wide range of luminosities , increasing the susceptibility to uncertainties in the stellar evolution models adopted .",
    "nevertheless , comparison across different implementations and with gaia / hipparcos parallaxes suggest that no significant systematic errors are present in the distances adopted in this paper .",
    "distances derived by the sdss - iii brazilian participation group ( bpg ; santiago et al .",
    "2016 ) were computed using the bayesian methodology explained in burnett & binney ( 2010 ) , burnett et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and binney et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . from the measured spectroscopic parameters",
    "coupled with 2mass photometry , they obtained the posterior distance probablility distribution function ( pdf ) for each star over a grid of parsec ( bressan 2012 ) stellar evolutionary models .",
    "their model prior includes information such as the spatial distribution of stars in our galaxy and the initial mass function .",
    "the bpg considered the aspcap [ m / h ] calibrated values , except for metallicities [ m / h ] @xmath36 , because in this regime stars may be `` over''-calibrated , due to the choice of a second - order fit to the data values running away at the edges of its range of validity .",
    "they also applied an additional surface gravity calibration with respect to the dr12 @xmath23 values for stars belonging to the red clump .",
    "this does not affect our sample because we only consider stars with @xmath23 < 3.5 , which are not members of the red clump .",
    "the accuracy of their results was tested with simulations and previous distance estimates for several samples of observations from the literature .",
    "the statistical distance uncertainties are at a level of 20% .",
    "although we can not completely exclude this possibility , there are no strong indications of systematic distance biases towards large distances ( low gravities ) .",
    "hayden et al . ( 2015 ; h15 ) derived distances following the same methodology as the bpg .",
    "they compared the stellar parameters from aspcap with parsec isochrones from the padova - trieste group ( bressan et al .",
    "2012 ) , considering matches within 3@xmath37 .",
    "they then computed the probability distribution function of all distance moduli in the range between the minimum and maximum magnitudes matching the isochrone grid .",
    "as for the bpg estimates , the precisions are at a level of 15 - 20% .    finally , the methodology followed by schultheis et al .",
    "( 2014 ; s14 ) consisted of comparing with padova isochrones from marigo et al . ( 2008 ) , and looking for those that match most closely with the aspcap parameters @xmath38 , @xmath23 , and calibrated [ m / h ] .",
    "these authors recognized that not taking into account the @xmath8-element enhancements and the use of solar - scaled isochrones may introduce errors in their distance estimates .",
    "thus , they estimated the median precisions in their derived distances to be on the order of @xmath39% .    from these three sets of distance estimates ,",
    "we determine distances from the galactic center , @xmath1 , as follows :    @xmath40    and the distance from the galactic plane , @xmath41 ,    @xmath42    where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the galactic coordinates , provided in the apogee data files , and @xmath45 kpc , given by ghez et al .",

    "we analyse whether the variance of the median [ x / fe ] ratios , calculated from the distance estimates by the several groups described in section  [ verifications ] , follows the same trends inferred from an individual set of estimates .",
    "we evaluate the median [ fe / h ] values , as a function of @xmath1 , using distances calculated by bpg , h15 , and s14 .",

    "the slopes would be higher if [ x / fe ] were underestimated .",
    "uncertainties in the stellar parameters could lead to systematic errors in the chemical abundances and thus distortions in the inferred chemical trends .",
    "mszros et al .",
    "2015 investigated about the deviations in [ fe / h ] , [ c / fe ] , [ n / fe ] , and [ @xmath8/fe ] ( each of the aspcap @xmath8-elements ) due to uncertainties in @xmath22 . from their figure 3",
    "we observe that the most sensible ratio to a @xmath22 variation is [ o / fe ] .",
    "a @xmath75 k would imply a @xmath76 dex in the rgb , and an uncertainty in [ o / fe ] @xmath11 0.25 dex ( lower for the other abundances of our interest ) .",
    "the peak of the @xmath23 distribution in the @xmath53 and @xmath9 kpc bins shift toward 0.5 dex lower , aproximately .",
    "considering the number of the stars in our furthest bin , we derive that the possible systematic error due to uncertainties in the parameters would lead to underestimate 0.08 dex our [ o / fe ] .",
    "however , we detect a larger variation at the most metal - rich side .",
    "the apogee sample comprises stars in the red giant branch ( rgb ) and possibly in the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stages of evolution .",
    "these stages are reached by lims , producing , at the same time , heavy elements with diverse efficiencies , depending on the initial mass and metallicity of the stars .",
    "the photospheres of these stars are enriched mainly by carbon , nitrogen , fluorine , and heavier elements synthetized by the slow neutron capture process ( the @xmath77-process ) and by proton - capture nucleosynthesis ( the @xmath78-process ) .",
    "the mixing from the interior ( core and shells surrounding the core ) to the stellar envelope results in self - pollution of the stellar photosphere .",
    "the abundances of all the @xmath79-elements analised in this paper ( o , mg , si , s ca , ti ) are representative of those abundances in the interstellar medium from which the stars formed , because these chemical elements are not synthetized and are not carried to the photosphere of lims , ( see review by karakas & lattanzio 2014 ) .",
    "moreover , half of the other elements studied in this work ( k , v , mn , ni ) are also not generated by lims .",
    "therefore , our results for o , mg , si , s , ca , ti , k , v , mn , ni are independent of the evolutionary status of the apogee stars .",
    "nevertheless , c , n , na , and al are produced by lims , but in very different proportions . among these four elements :    1 .",
    "c is the most produced , mainly by low - mass stars ( @xmath80 ) during the thermal pulses and the third dredge - up ( during the agb ) .",
    "n is the second most produced , mainly by intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath81 ) during the first and second dredge - ups ( during the ascent of the rgb and agb , respectively ) and hot bottom burning .",
    "na and al are synthetized mainly by stars with @xmath81 during the second and third dredge - ups , with na more abundantly produced than al .",
    "since c and n are mainly produced by lims , we caution that c and n do not reliably represent of the original stellar abundances .",
    "the na and al abundances might be enhanced at high galactocentric radii , because :    1 .",
    "these elements are produced by intermediate - mass stars in evolved stages ( agb ) and consequently by more luminous stars , and 2 .",
    "the apogee sample at large @xmath1 may be more weighted towards these more luminous objects .    however , the @xmath1-trends of na and al ( figures 2 and 3 ) appear to show no enhacenment at large radii .    stars at different distances could also have different age distributions : at the bottom of the giant branch stars may be biased toward a different age distribution than at the upper side , which might affect the overall chemical trends .",
    "nearer stars would be biased toward slightly younger and more metal - rich stars and further stars toward older and more metal - poor ones : however , if it were the case , further stars would show higher [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios , because older stars would have formed from an ism mainly enriched by snii .",
    "our analysis reveals the opposite trend with galactocentric distance .",
    "finally , we estimate the impact of the distance errors in our sample . we assume a normal distribution with uncertainties of @xmath82 , and add this noise to the bpg distance values . the resulting fraction of stars with @xmath83 ( after adding the noise ) but @xmath84 ( without noise ) , respect to the stars with @xmath26 , is @xmath85 for @xmath53 kpc , @xmath86 for @xmath54 kpc , and @xmath87 for @xmath9 kpc . however , these fractions reduce to @xmath88 and lower if we consider stars at @xmath89 .",
    "this means that there could be a contamination of @xmath90 of stars at @xmath91 kpc in our @xmath53 bin . at this @xmath92 range ,",
    "the density of thin disc stars is negligible , of thick disc stars is @xmath93 the density of stars in the plane , and a little less for the density of halo stars .",
    "thus , @xmath94 of the contaminant stars , i.e. , a @xmath95 of the stars in the @xmath53 kpc bin , are likely to belong to the thick disc . the resultant median abundances would be dominated by halo stars . besides , previous works have not found differences in chemistry between thick disc and halo stars .",
    "therefore , we assert that the chemical trends would not be greatly distorted by this contamination .",
    "differences for a number of the chemical trends with [ m / h ] are clear between stars at @xmath53 and @xmath9 kpc .",
    "the lower @xmath8-element - to - iron ratios found at larger distances are consistent with the low-@xmath8 population reported during the past decade by a number of workers ( e.g. , fulbright 2002 ; gratton et al . 2003 ; nissen & schuster 2010 , 2011 ; ishigaki et al .",
    "2012 , 2013 ; hawkins et al . 2015 ) . from the kinematical properties of their samples , they estimated that the orbits of these stars would place them farther away than stars exhibiting higher [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios .",
    "this is consistent with our finding ( and that of fa15 ) .",
    "our present study finds a decrease with @xmath1 consistent with that obtained by fa15 at @xmath96 kpc .",
    "they also observed a considerably larger drop occurring at a galactocenctric radius between @xmath97 kpc , which we can not confirm in this work , as the apogee observations do not extend to cover this distance range .",
    "the trend observed with [ m / h ] for the low-[@xmath8/fe ] population has been interpreted in terms of type ia sne , which contribute iron but little @xmath8-elements .",
    "the differences in [ x / fe ] observed in the present work between stars at @xmath53 kpc and @xmath9 kpc for the @xmath8-elements ( @xmath7 dex for si , ca , and ti , and higher for o , mg , and s ) are consistent with their expected relative contributions in sneia explosions ( tsujimoto et al . 1995 )  higher for si ( @xmath98 ) and ca ( @xmath99 ) than for mg , o , and s ( negligible ) .",
    "it is envisioned that this population would form later , during a long period of a relatively slow star formation , from an ism polluted by both type ii sne and type ia sne .",
    "the high-[@xmath8/fe ] population would form much earlier , during a short period of rapid star formation , as these stars originated from an ism enriched mainly by type ii sne .",
    "if the star - formation history presents several bursts , the high-@xmath8 stars would form during the early bursts , while the low-@xmath8 stars would form at the beginning of later bursts from a ism contaminated by recent sneia , as appears to have occurred in dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( see , e.g. , carigi et al .",
    "nissen & schuster ( 2010 ) also proposed that the low-@xmath8 population could be born in systems that were later accreted into the milky way s halo , and which had experienced a long star - formation history .",
    "however , the decrease in [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios due to the contribution of sneia encounters difficulty in explaining the pattern of some abundance ratios , in particular , the decrease observed for [ ni / fe ] with metallicity for the low-@xmath8 population , and the absence of different [ mn / fe ] ratios between both populations .",
    "these two elements are expected to be released by sneia ; thus , different patterns should be detected in ni and mn with respect to iron between stars formed in an ism enriched by sneia and stars that formed from gas without their contribution .",
    "in fact , it would be expected that low-@xmath8 stars would have higher [ ni / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] than the high-@xmath8 stars . however ,",
    "this is not seen either in our work or in previous studies .",
    "a possible explanation was suggested by kobayashi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , who claimed that , for an imf biased toward stars that explode as low - mass snie - ii , this would lead to lower [ @xmath8/fe ] .",
    "kobayashi et al . ( 2014 ) also proposed that the nucleosynthesis of 10 - 20 m@xmath100 stars could explain the difference in the [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios detected in halo stars .",
    "interestingly , mcwilliam et al .",
    "( 2013 ) also claimed that a ` top - light ' imf might provide an explanation for the [ @xmath8/fe ] and [ eu / fe ] deficiencies found in the analysis of the m54 cluster belonging to the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy .",
    "this possibility would also explain the [ mn / fe ] and [ ni / fe ] patterns , but it would imply a complex imf behaviour to explain the different trends  a metallicity dependent imf for the low-@xmath8 stars and a metallicity independent imf for the high-@xmath8 population , as nissen & schuster ( 2011 ) indicated .",
    "another remaining issue is the fact that the nucleosynthetic contribution from agb stars ( the immediate progenitors of the white dwarfs involved in type ia sne explosions ) should be detected in the low-@xmath8 population , if sneia have contributed their iron .",
    "however , these stars exhibit _ lower _ [ na / fe ] ratios than the stars presumed to be formed prior to the contributions from sneia . as nissen",
    "( 2014 ) speculated , this could be the result if the progenitors of the low-@xmath8 population were stars of intermediate mass ( 4 - 8 m@xmath100 ) , which contribute little c to the ism , and even less na and al .",
    "the lower median [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] ratios that we found for stars at @xmath9 kpc are consistent with a slow chemical - enrichment history .",
    "no signature of significant enrichment from agbs ( neither na nor al ) are detected in the distance bin where the low-@xmath8 population dominates .",
    "the observed increase in [ al / fe ] observed for stars in the inner regions can be explained with the assumption of metallicity - dependent yields for massive stars ( nomoto et al .",
    "2013 ) , and the flat trend with [ m / h ] for the farthest stars by the cancellation of the increase in al by the even higher contribution of fe from sneia .",
    "however , we do not detect an increasing trend of [ na / fe ] with [ m / h ] in the nearest stars , as observed by nissen & schuster ( 2010 ) for the high-@xmath8 population , which is well - explained by the same metallicity - dependent yields also invoked for na ( nomoto et al .",
    "observationally , na is determined by apogee from relatively weak lines in the h - band , yielding less accurate measurements , as suggested by the large scatter detected in our sample as well as in holtzman et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , when inspecting [ na / fe ] vs. [ fe / h ] . for these reasons ,",
    "our na results should be considered with caution .    the higher [ x / fe ] ratios at metallicities lower than @xmath101 but lower ratios at higher metallicities , may be explained by the combination of a top - heavy imf and a slower star - formation rate ( sfr ) in the subsystems accreted by the galaxy .",
    "recent cosmological simulations predict that massive satellites merging with the host galaxy contribute at smaller radii than low - mass systems ( amorisco 2015 ) .",
    "low - mass systems are expected to experience outflows that release their gas .",
    "this would prevent , or at least greatly suppress , subsequent star formation .",
    "the expected imf for low - mass stellar systems at low metallicities is characterized by discontinuities , i.e. , a lack of some massive stars ( cervio 2013 ) .",
    "the signature of the few high - mass stars in such low - metallicity environments produces stochastic effects on the abundance ratios ( carigi & hernndez 2008 ) , which could explain the higher dispersion observed in [ x / fe ] for metal - poor stars .    the stars that we observe today at metallicities lower than @xmath101 , born in these low - mass subsystems ,",
    "would be formed from the nucleosynthetic contribution from a few very massive stars , leading to high ratios with respect to iron at very low metallicities , followed by less - massive stars slowly contributing to the ism where the current stars were born . on the contrary",
    ", the inner regions would be formed in an ism that would have reached the same metallicity faster , with the contribution of a larger number of massive stars , although the upper mass limit of the imf would be lower ( yamada et al . 2013 ) .",
    "we have analysed a sample of @xmath27 halo stars targeted by the apogee survey , located at @xmath26 kpc from the galactic plane , and evaluated the chemical trends for the 15 individual abundances determined by aspcap . in order to be sure that our trends were not unduly influenced by the estimated distances to our stars , we made use of the available distances estimated by three independent methods for apogee stars .",
    "our main conclusions are the following :    1 .",
    "an analysis of the elemental abundance ( [ x / h ] ) variation with distance from the galactic center , @xmath1 , up to the farthest distances observed by apogee ( @xmath21 kpc ) , revealed that the chemical trends are almost constant or decrease with @xmath1 .",
    "the variation mainly occurred for stars with a global metallicity [ m / h ] @xmath62 .",
    "we confirmed that the qualitative chemical trends inferred from our data do not depend on the considered distance set .",
    "the resulting iron abundance trend calculated from the calibrated [ m / h ] parameter is constant across the range of @xmath1 examined , @xmath102 kpc .",
    "the variation for nearer stars measured in our analysis is barely lower than that observed in the previous analysis of in situ halo stars performed by fa15 with sdss optical spectra at lower resolution .",
    "they also reported a larger decrease taking place at @xmath97 kpc .",
    "our evaluation of [ fe / h ] and [ ca / h ] are consistent with their results , but we can not probe the chemical trends at @xmath97 kpc due to a lack of sample stars in this distance range .",
    "the median calibrated [ m / h ] values , @xmath5 , also agrees with previous reports for inner - halo stars ( carollo et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ; chen et al . 2014 ; fa15 ) .",
    "the derived mdf from [ m / h ] also shows a second peak at [ m / h ] @xmath6 , which resembles the median metallicity value associated with the outer - halo population ( carollo et al .",
    "2007 , 2010 ; beers et al . 2012 ) . 5 .",
    "we also evaluated the trends in the abundance ratios relative to iron , [ x / fe ] , with distance from the galactic center from in situ stars for 14 chemical elements .",
    "this analysis shows that a population of stars with different @xmath8-element enrichment becomes dominant beyond @xmath103 kpc : + \\a ) for the @xmath8-elements , we found significantly lower ratios for more distant stars at metallicities [ m / h ] @xmath62 .",
    "we observed a larger separation in these two populations for [ o / fe ] , [ mg / fe ] and [ s / fe ] , but all the @xmath8-elements show a significant decrease of @xmath104 dex .",
    "+ our [ ca / fe ] results with @xmath1 and [ m / h ] are consistent with the results reported by fa15 based on sdss optical spectra . on the contrary",

    "we detect different [ mn / fe ] ratios between the inner and outer regions for the most metal - poor stars ( [ m / h ] @xmath56 ) , although a larger sample of stars at distances farther than 15 kpc and more accurate measurements are necessary to confirm this result .",
    "+ \\c ) the [ k / fe ] trends with @xmath1 and [ m / h ] also provide evidence for different chemical abundance patterns in stars at @xmath53 kpc and @xmath9 kpc .",
    "+ \\d ) both [ na / fe ] and [ al / fe ] reveal different chemical patterns for the nearer stars compared with the more distant stars .",
    "the [ na / fe ] ratio exhibits different trends with @xmath1 and [ m / h ] than found for [ al / fe ] , but the na measurements are less reliable .",
    "the [ al / fe ] ratio increases with metallicity for inner - halo stars , while the more distant stars exhibit a flat trend .",
    "this work corroborates the suggestion that stars with low [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios are predominant at larger distances than stars with higher [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios , in agreement with previous work that inferred the distances for the low- and high-@xmath8 populations based on their kinematical properties ( nissen & schuster 2010 , 2011 ; ishigaki et al .",
    "the lower [ @xmath8/fe ] ratios are consistent with iron enrichment due to sneia ; the [ al / fe ] chemical patterns are also consistent with this hypothesis .",
    "the [ ni / fe ] and [ mn / fe ] exhibit trends with metallicity in both populations that are also consistent with these previous studies .",
    "however , their chemical patterns , as well as the lack of signatures of agb enrichment , are not those expected in a scenario where sneia had time to explode . the characteristics of the environments where both populations were formed remains unclear .    in conclusion , the chemical trends inferred for stars ranging over distances from the galactic center of @xmath106 kpc suggest that , at @xmath9 kpc , a stellar population begins to dominate which formed with a different chemical - enrichment history than stars at @xmath107 kpc . characterization of the different stellar populations with a larger sample of stars will better constrain the imf and sfr associated with these previous stellar populations . high - quality data for stars at @xmath1 farther than 15 kpc will help to clarify the chemical properties of the more distant stellar populations in the galactic halo . alternatively , the identification of nearby halo stars that probe to large distances ( on the basis of their extreme kinematics ) will also permit an increase in the number of suitable outer - halo stars for further analysis .",

    "<S> the galaxy formation process in the @xmath0-cold dark matter scenario can be constrained from the analysis of stars in the milky way s halo system . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the variation of chemical abundances in distant halo stars observed by the apache point galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) , as a function of distance from the galactic center ( @xmath1 ) and iron abundance ( [ m / h ] ) , in the range 5 @xmath2 30 kpc and @xmath3 [ m / h ] @xmath4 0.0 . we perform a statistical analysis of the abundance ratios derived by the apogee pipeline ( aspcap ) and distances calculated by several approaches . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis reveals signatures of a different chemical enrichment between the inner and outer regions of the halo , with a transition at about 15 kpc . </S>",
    "<S> the derived metallicity distribution function exhibits two peaks , at [ m / h ] @xmath5 and @xmath6 , consistent with previously reported halo metallicity distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain a difference of @xmath7 dex for @xmath8-element - to - iron ratios for stars at @xmath9 kpc and [ m / h ] @xmath10 ( larger in the case of o , mg and s ) with respect to the nearest halo stars . </S>",
    "<S> this result confirms previous claims for low-@xmath8 stars found at larger distances . </S>",
    "<S> chemical differences in elements with other nucleosynthetic origins ( ni , k , na , and al ) are also detected . </S>",
    "<S> c and n do not provide reliable information about the interstellar medium from which stars formed because our sample comprises rgb and agb stars and can experience mixing of material to their surfaces .    </S>",
