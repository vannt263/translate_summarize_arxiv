    "let @xmath2 be a finitely generated non - abelian free group .",
    "we shall say that a unitary representation @xmath3 of a group @xmath4 is _ tempered _ if it is weakly contained in the regular representation . in @xcite , the second and the third author introduced a new family of tempered unitary representations of @xmath2 .",
    "this class is large enough to include all known representations that are obtained by embedding @xmath2 into the automorphism group of its cayley graph . beside being rather exhaustive ,",
    "these representations have interesting properties in their own right , such as for example beeing representations of the crossed product @xmath5-algebra @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath5-algebra of continuos functions on the boundary @xmath8 of @xmath9 ( see the discussion after theorem  [ thm_intro:3 ] ) .",
    "the definition of these representations requires a set of data , called _ matrix system with inner product _ , consisting of a ( complex ) vector space and a positive definite sesquilinear form for each generator , as well as linear maps between any two pairs of vector spaces , all subject to some compatibility condition ( recalled in   [ sec : recall ] ) .",
    "we generalize in this paper the construction in @xcite by releasing the condition that the matrix system with inner product be irreducible ( see definition  [ equiv ] ) .",
    "the irreducibility in @xcite insured that , except in sporadic and well understood special cases , the unitary representations so constructed would be irreducible .",
    "the starting point in this paper is the following result , according to which irreducibility of the matrix system is not essential : representations arising from non - irreducible matrix systems are anyway finitely reducible in the following sense :    every representation @xmath3 constructed from a matrix system with inner products @xmath10 decomposes into the orthogonal direct sum with respect to @xmath11 of a finite number of representations constructed from irreducible matrix systems .",
    "we call such a representation _ multiplicative _ and we denote by @xmath0 the class of representations that are unitarily equivalent to a multiplicative representation ( see the end of   [ sec : recall ] for the precise definition ) . that we are allowed to drop the dependence of the set of free generators follows from the following important result :    [ thm : change ]",
    "let @xmath12 and @xmath13 be two symmetric sets of free generators of a free group @xmath2 , and let us denote by @xmath14 and @xmath15 the group @xmath2 as generated respectively by @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "then for every @xmath16 there exists a matrix system with inner product indexed on @xmath12 , such that @xmath17 .",
    "in particular the class @xmath0 is @xmath1-invariant .",
    "in @xcite the authors give an explicit realization of several known representations , such as for example the spherical series of fig - talamanca and picardello @xcite , as multiplicative representations with respect to scalar matrices acting on one dimentional spaces . at the same time in @xcite",
    "it is shown that if @xmath18 and @xmath19 are spherical series representations corresponding to different generating sets , say @xmath13 and @xmath12 , then they can not be equivalent unless @xmath12 is obtainable by @xmath13 by an automorphism of the cayley graph associated to the generating set @xmath13 .",
    "the above theorem insures that , when we think of a spherical representation as a multiplicative representation this pathology disappears , in the sense that a spherical representation @xmath18 corresponding to a given generating set @xmath13 will be realized as a multiplicative representation with respect to another generating set @xmath12 ( although in this case the new matrices will fail to be scalars , as on can see in example  [ ex : spherical ] ) .",
    "the class @xmath0 allows us to define a new class of representations for virtually free groups @xmath20 ( see @xcite ) : @xmath21 is defined as the class of representations obtained by inducing to @xmath20 a multiplicative representation of a free subgroup of finite index .",
    "the proof that the class @xmath21 is independent of the choice of the free subgroup depends on the following further interesting stability property of the class @xmath0 .",

    "2 .   if @xmath27 , then the induction of @xmath24 to @xmath2 belongs to @xmath0 .",
    "since representations of the class @xmath0 are tempered , the same is true for those of the class @xmath21 .",

    ", that is representations of the cross product @xmath28-algebra @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the @xmath28-algebra of the continuous functions on the boundary @xmath31 of @xmath2 .",
    "boundary representations are exactly those which admit a _ boundary realization _ , that is , a relization as a direct integral over @xmath8 with respect to some quasi - invariant measure .    as boundary representations as well , the representations in the class @xmath0 enjoy all of the above properties and this is again an essential ingredient in the proof that every representation in the class @xmath21 extends to a representation of @xmath32 and hence admits a boundary realization after identifying the two boundaries @xmath33 and @xmath8 .",
    "incidentally , it is proved in @xcite that _ every _ tempered representation of a torsion - free not almost cyclic gromov hyperbolic group has a boundary realization .    however , while the existence of such a boundary realization for a representation of a gromov hyperbolic group follows from general @xmath28-algebra inclusions as well extension properties using hanh  banach theorem , and is hence highly non - constructive , for representations in the class @xmath0 the boundary realization is more accessible and sometimes very concrete . its uniqueness is also studied in details in the scalar case in @xcite , but remains in general an open question .",

    "when we use @xmath35 , for @xmath36 , for elements of  @xmath14 , it is intended that they are elements of  @xmath12 .",
