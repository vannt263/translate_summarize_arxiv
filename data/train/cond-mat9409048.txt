    "for a vast number of materials with strong electron correlation , the low energy excitations involve both itinerant electrons and well localized magnetic moments residing periodically on the lattice sites .",
    "this is the case of heavy fermion compounds  @xcite , and to certain extent it is also the case of high temperature superconducting cuprates  @xcite . in such systems , two effects have crucial influence on the low energy properties and they compete with each other .",
    "they are the kondo effect  @xcite and rkky interaction  @xcite , which represent two different tendencies of the system to quench the local moments with conduction electrons or by themselves .",
    "the simplest model capturing both effects is the two - impurity kondo model  @xcite .",
    "it is also believed that any possible new physics that may occur in lattice due to the competition between the two effects should be contained in the two - impurity problem  @xcite .",
    "a simple way to see how the competition arises in the two - impurity kondo model is to look at the problem from the scaling point of view  @xcite . the complexity of the problem will be fully realized this way and the concrete task we are facing",
    "will be defined . for all practical purposes ,",
    "the bare kondo coupling constant @xmath0 and the rkky interaction @xmath1 are much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath2 .",
    "thus , if we form two dimensionless coupling constants with the help of the conduction electron density of states @xmath3(@xmath4 ) , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , they are always in the weak coupling regime . however , as we start to eliminate high energy conduction electron states near the top and bottom of the conduction band , both dimensionless coupling constants grow under renormalization and they mutually renormalize each other .",
    "simple dimensional counting shows that @xmath7 has dimension one and is marginally relevant , while @xmath6 has dimension zero and is relevant .",
    "for these two relevant interactions we can define two energy scales , the kondo temperature @xmath8 and rkky temperature @xmath9 , such that they correspond to the values of the decreasing conduction bandwidth at which the renormalized dimensionless coupling constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 reach the unity respectively . in either @xmath12 or @xmath13 limit ,",
    "the problem is simple because we can perturb one of the two interactions .",
    "the most difficult situation corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "this is also the situation of most practical interest .    due to the broad interest in the competition between the kondo effect and rkky interaction , extensive investigations",
    "have been carried out in the last decade  @xcite . as a result",
    ", a convincing phase diagram has emerged  @xcite , if not yet universally accepted without reservation  @xcite .",
    "this phase diagram is shown in figure  [ phase_diag ] .",
    "the model exhibits fermi - liquid behavior everywhere except at a special point on the particle - hole symmetric axis . at this point ,",
    "the ratio between the fully renormalized effective rkky interaction and the kondo temperature is numerically estimated to be @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "the effective rkky interaction is actually the rkky temperature whose meaning we have explained in the above .",
    "but for some reason it has been confusingly called rkky interaction . although the precise numerical value of the ratio may depend on the individual s convention of defining the coupling constants",
    ", the important message is that this critical point is located at @xmath14 .",
    "although several asymptotically exact results have been available about the critical point in certain limits  @xcite , the exact physical origin of this critical point had not been unveiled until recently  @xcite . by an explicit identification of two local impurity spin states whose level crossing being the origin of the critical point ,",
    "we have rigorously shown how the constraints set by the discrete symmetries of the model ensures the occurrence of a non - fermi - liquid critical point .",
    "we have also presented an effective hamiltonian for the finite solution region as marked in figure  [ phase_diag ] , and listed the low temperature properties of the critical point . in this paper , we present a detailed derivation of the effective hamiltonian , and for the first time a full analytic solution for the whole solution region of figure  [ phase_diag ] .",
    "having admitted the existence of the critical point , we can already present a framework for the solution inside that solution region in figure  [ phase_diag ] , by only invoking general scaling ideas .",
    "it is then the task of section  [ low - t - prop ] to fill in concrete results .",
    "since kondo effect always takes place in our solution region , the basic energy scale must be the kondo temperature @xmath8 , which is much smaller than the fermi energy .",
    "on the scale of @xmath8 , the system has already lost its memory of microscopic details existed on the energy scale of the fermi energy .",
    "the above mentioned @xmath9 is of the same order as @xmath8 , and therefore does not constitute a new energy scale by itself .",
    "however , the competition induces the second energy scale @xmath16 .",
    "inside our solution region , @xmath17 , and @xmath16 vanishes at the critical point . for any physical quantity",
    ", its dependence on the bare parameters of the hamiltonian should be absorbed into these two energy scales .",
    "for instance , we can write the specific heat in the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is some universal two - variable function . the role of @xmath8 is simply to set an energy unit for the problem .",
    "the second energy scale @xmath16 determines the crossover from the non - fermi - liquid behavior governed by the critical point at @xmath20 to the fermi - liquid behavior governed by the stable fermi - liquid fixed point at @xmath21 .",
    "if we recall how the appearance of the kondo temperature @xmath8(@xmath22 ) in the one - impurity kondo problem leads to the drastic enhancement of various physical quantities including specific heat , we can expect additional enhancement from the appearance of @xmath16(@xmath23 ) .",
    "the translation of this effect to the lattice problem will be a new mechanism for the heavy electron mass .",
    "moving far away from the critical point in the phase diagram , the accuracy of our solution deteriorates .",
    "however , the low energy exponents for all physical quantities should not change since after all the system is still governed by a fermi - liquid fixed point , as in the solution region of figure  [ phase_diag ] near the critical point .",
    "what need to be improved are the constant prefactors .",
    "usually , a physical quantity calculated for a fermi - liquid fixed point is a sum of several contributions with the same exponent . among them , only a few are associated with the energy scale @xmath16 , while the others are associated with @xmath8 .",
    "what we calculate in this paper are those contributions associated with the energy scale @xmath16 .",
    "this is enough near the critical point because they are enhanced inside our solution region of figure  [ phase_diag ] .",
    "as one moves away from the critical point , the other contributions associated with the energy scale @xmath8 become increasingly significant .",
    "certainly , one can always fit the prefactors for every physical quantity if well established numerical results or experimental data are available .",
    "but it is the merit of the theory to establish the relations between these prefactors in the same spirit of nozires s fermi - liquid theory of kondo effect  @xcite .",
    "a complete solution of the two - impurity kondo model for the whole parameter space is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the layout of the paper is the following . in section  [ red_1d ] , we present the preliminary transformations on the two - impurity kondo model including the reduction to one dimension and bosonization . in section  [ mapping ] , we identify the critical point and derive the effective hamiltonian . a rigorous proof of the completeness of the effective hamiltonian is included . in section  [ low - t - prop",

    "they are listed in table  [ blocks ] .",
    "some explanations are necessary at this point .",
    "first , it is well known that 1d extended fermion operators have scaling dimension 1/2 .",
    "this can be easily seen from the free fermion action @xmath159 .",
    "secondly , we have noted before that @xmath160 and @xmath161 can only appear in the product @xmath161 @xmath160 .",
    "therefore , the spin degrees of freedom do not bring in the dimension 1/2 operators @xmath160 and @xmath161 as additional building blocks in table  [ blocks ] .",

    "as can be seen from the free fermion action @xmath162 , we need not change @xmath130 and @xmath131 under a rescaling of the imaginary time @xmath163 .",
    "this would imply that both combinations @xmath164 have scaling dimension zero .",
    "however , the dimension of the operator combination @xmath165 is raised to 1/2 by the hybridization term in ( [ hfp ] ) with coefficient @xmath150 .",
    "this follows immediately from the requirement of preserving scale invariance of the hybridization term under a rescaling of @xmath154 and @xmath163 .",
    "lastly , because both @xmath130 and @xmath131 are odd under parity and @xmath153 rotation around @xmath154-axis , only @xmath166 could hybridize with them to give rise to a term in the effective hamiltonian even under all discrete symmetries , as can be seen from table  [ blocks ] . out of two linear independent combinations from @xmath130 and @xmath131 , @xmath166 could only hybridize with one . requiring it to be hermitian , the hybridizing combination could be either @xmath165 or @xmath167 .",
    "thus , once @xmath168(d+d^{\\dagger})$ ] is generated in ( [ hfp ] ) , @xmath169 $ ] is forbidden .",
    "this guarantees that the dimension of @xmath167 will remain to be zero , like usual local operators .    to construct operators in the projected hilbert space , we only need to multiply together the building blocks of table  [ blocks ] and keep products of even number of fermionic operators .",
    "we list all dimension 1/2 operators in table  [ dim12 ] , all dimension 1 operators in table  [ dim1 ] , and all dimension 3/2 operators in table  [ dim32 ] .",
    "let us first consider the particle - hole symmetric case .",
    "any operator that could appear in the effective hamiltonian must be even under all three discrete symmetry operations  ( [ symm1 ] ) .",
    "we can explicitly verify that all allowed operators up to dimension 3/2 that could appear in the effective hamiltonian have been included in ( [ hfp ] ) and ( [ hpert ] ) . in order to couple to the uniform magnetic field",
    ", an operator has to be even under parity and particle - hole transformations but odd under @xmath153 rotation around @xmath154-axis . from tables  [ dim12 ] and [ dim1 ]",
    ", we also verify that the only allowed operator up to dimension 1 inclusive is the one appearing in ( [ hfp ] ) .",
    "as to the operators that could couple to the staggered magnetic field , they must be even under particle - hole transformation but odd under parity transformation and @xmath153 rotation around @xmath154-axis . apart from the dimension 1/2 operator that couples to the staggered field in ( [ hfp ] ) , two more dimension 1 operators are allowed by the symmetries .",
    "they are the third and fourth operators in table  [ dim1 ] .",
    "thus , including marginal operators we could have the following additional staggered field coupling terms added to ( [ heff ] ) , @xmath170 \\left [ \\psi_{sf}(0)-\\psi_{sf}^{\\dagger}(0 ) \\right ] + i \\alpha''_{s } h_{s } \\left [ \\psi_{sf}(0)+\\psi_{sf}^{\\dagger}(0 ) \\right ] ( d+d^{\\dagger } ) ,                \\label{hstag_more}\\ ] ] where @xmath171 and @xmath172 are two dimensionless parameters depending on the original coupling constants of ( [ hamil ] )",
    ". nevertheless , the contributions to the staggered susceptibility from ( [ hstag_more ] ) are negligible as we shall see in appendix  [ more_chis ] .",

    "@xmath131 to absorb the phase @xmath180 , we reduce the hybridizing combination to either @xmath173 or @xmath181 . in other words , we can always choose a proper definition for @xmath130 and @xmath131 so that only one of @xmath164 hybridizes with @xmath166 .",

    "a redefinition of @xmath130 and @xmath131 to absorb a second phase to eliminate @xmath174 ( d+d^{\\dagger } ) $ ] from the stageered field coupling terms in ( [ hfp])+([hstag_more ] ) is not possible without spoiling the simple hybridization form of the fixed point hamiltonian  ( [ hfp ] ) .",
    "when the particle - hole symmetry is broken , another relevant operator becomes allowed , as can be seen from table  [ dim12 ] .",
    "this is the dimension 1/2 operator in ( [ hphb ] ) .",
    "there are also two dimension 1 operators breaking only particle - hole symmetry . from table",

    "the first term in ( [ hphb_more ] ) is the original particle - hole symmetry breaking term ( [ h2_3 ] ) , surviving the first order projection .",
    "the second term is a generated one from high orders and can not be eliminated by a simple phase absorption in @xmath130 and @xmath131 for the same reason of the last paragraph .",
    "summarizing this section , ( [ heff])+([hstag_more])+([hphb_more ] ) constitutes the most general effective hamiltonian for the solution region of figure  [ phase_diag ] , even allowing particle - hole symmetry breaking .",
    "what are omitted up to dimension 3/2 only include :    * a dimension 1 operator @xmath184   \\left [ \\psi_{f}(0 ) + \\psi_{f}^{\\dagger}(0 ) \\right ] $ ] , which could couple to the staggered field @xmath54 but breaks the particle - hole symmetry .",
    "thus , the coefficient of this operator must be proportional to the particle - hole symmetry breaking potential @xmath58 .",
    "close to the critical point , we expect this coefficient to be significantly suppressed",

    "two dimension 3/2 operators breaking only particle - hole symmetry , as can be seen from table  [ dim32 ] .",

    "their contributions to the susceptibilities vanish according to high powers of temperature as @xmath185 .",
    "it is worth pointing out that up to dimension 3/2 the number of allowed operators around the critical point and their dimensions are in complete agreement with the conformal theory results  @xcite .",

    "although this does not prove the irrelevance of the spin anisotropy introduced in our approach because the introduced anisotropy is not small , it does point to the right direction .",
    "it is worthwhile recalling that the spin anisotropy is irrelevant for all kinds of one - impurity kondo problem , including the exactly screened  @xcite and overscreened cases  @xcite . leaving aside specifics of the two - impurity kondo model ,",
    "these early experiences in related kondo problems give us considerable confidence that the critical point of the two - impurity model that has been studied from different approaches belongs to the same universality class .",
    "since the behavior of the system above @xmath16 and the way the system flows to the stable fermi - liquid fixed point below @xmath16 are all governed by the critical point , the universality of the critical point also implies the universal behavior inside the solution region of figure  [ phase_diag ] , as well as all crossover functions .",
    "in particular , the crossover functions we have derived for the specific heat and staggered susceptibility are expected to be universal . for a comparison of the results from different approaches ,",

    "the complete agreement of the critical behavior further ensures us the universality of the critical point .",
    "as to compare with the numerical renormalization group results at @xmath249 , we first note that the empirical observation  @xcite of an additional hidden symmetry between the singlet and triplet impurity spin states at the critical point becomes crystal clear after our identification of the critical point , as can be seen from figure  [ loc_lev ] .",
    "so is its consequence about the value of the impurity spin correlation at the critical point , @xmath258 .",
    "however , this hidden symmetry is broken by the leading irrelevant operator , as we have noted before .",
    "this is similar to the well known dynamical symmetry breaking effect . in consistency with the numerical renormalization group result",
    ", we also find that the linear coefficient of the specific heat diverges quadratically in @xmath206 on the particle - hole symmetric axis , as can be seen from ( [ ct_lim ] ) .",
    "our result  ( [ chis_s1s2 ] ) , that the slope of the impurity spin correlation with respect to the variation of rkky interaction is logarithmically divergent , is broadly consistent with the numerical renormalization group result which also found it singular .",
    "the only disagreement with the reported numerical renormalization group results is the behavior of the staggered susceptibility at @xmath249 .",
    "while @xmath259 has be claimed , we only find @xmath260 , as can be seen from ( [ chis_lim ] ) .",
    "noting that the other limiting behavior of ( [ chis_lim ] ) , @xmath261 at @xmath20 , is not disputed . even if one takes a cautious view about the numerically fitted critical exponent 2 for the staggered susceptibility , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath262 , the original numerical divergence seems to us much stronger than a logarithmic singularity .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is unknown at this moment .",
    "but at least the easy explanation of differently adopted definitions for the staggered susceptibility is unlikely . in this paper , we only couple the staggered field @xmath54 to @xmath109 in ( [ h01 ] ) .",
    "one could also couple @xmath54 to @xmath263/2 $ ] in ( [ h01 ] ) , or even to @xmath264/2 $ ] . in any case , the contributions to the staggered susceptibility after subtracting out the free fermi sea contribution should only come from the local operators which are odd under parity and @xmath153 rotation around @xmath154-axis .",
    "since we only have one such relevant operator , as can be seen from table  [ dim12 ] , we do not expect qualitative change of the behavior of the staggered susceptibility as a result of different definitions .",
    "a careful reexamination in the numerical renormalization group approach should be very helpful to clarify this point .",
    "we have presented an asymptotically exact solution for the two - impurity kondo model for a finite region of the parameter space surrounding the critical point , as shown in figure  [ phase_diag ] .",
    "we have also derived the analytic crossover functions for the specific heat and staggered susceptibility .",
    "this solution is made possible by an explicit identification of the critical point and its underlying physics . as we have explained in section  [ mapping ] , the condition for the criticality is the degeneracy between the two lowest impurity spin states , @xmath119 and @xmath120 . by varying rkky interaction across the critical point",
    ", these two levels cross each other .",
    "the non - fermi - liquid behavior at the critical point is a consequence of the fact that in the presence of the particle - hole symmetry only half of the degrees of freedom of the doublet can be compensated by the extended degrees of freedom associated with the conduction electrons . because of the special symmetry of the doublet , _",
    "i.e. _ one level is an even triplet and the other is an odd singlet , the local degrees of freedom of the doublet can only be compensated by the extended spin - flavor degrees of freedom of the conduction electrons . out of four species of spinless fermions or eight species of majorana fermions",
    "associated with all conduction electron degrees of freedom , only one species of majorana fermions , @xmath265 , is allowed by the symmetry to compensate the local degrees of the freedom of the doublet .",
    "this is the same physics responsible for the non - fermi - liquid behavior of the two - channel one - impurity kondo model .",
    "however , the doublet at the critical point of the two - impurity problem has different symmetry from the simple impurity spin up and down states of the two - channel problem .",
    "therefore , the operator contents around the fixed points(one unstable , the other stable ) are different .",
    "the nearly complete agreement of our results with those derived from the numerical renormalization group or conformal field theory approaches , except one limiting behavior of the staggered susceptibility , convincingly establishes the universality of the critical point .",
    "thus , the crossover functions we have derived in section  [ low - t - prop ] are also expected to be universal .",
    "the calculation of dynamical correlation functions such as the conduction electron green s function is currently under way .",
    "what have we learned about the lattice problem from the study of the two - impurity kondo model ?",
    "an obvious lesson is learned from the striking difference between the uniform and staggered susceptibilities .",
    "this difference is solely due to the competition between rkky interaction and the kondo effect .",
    "a direct and primitive translation to the kondo lattice problem would be the strong momentum @xmath266 dependence of the spin susceptibility @xmath267 . as a result of the competition",
    ", we should expect drastically different enhancement at different momentum transfer @xmath266 . from this perspective , the picture of a periodic array of coherent kondo scattering centers for the heavy fermion compounds is surely oversimplified .",
