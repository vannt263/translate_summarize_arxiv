    "the recently discovered superconductor @xmath2 has attracted considerable attention as being the first superconducting cobaltite and due to evidence for important electronic correlations @xcite .",
    "its superconducting transition temperature of maximum @xmath35  k exhibits a composition dependence , decreasing for both underdoped and overdoped materials , as observed in the cuprates .",
    "this suggests that a detailed characterization of the electronic and magnetic behavior of this new type of materials and their interplay with structural peculiarities may contribute to a more fundamental understanding of the high @xmath4 superconductivity in cuprates , such as the layered crystal structure @xcite , magnetic susceptibility @xcite , electronic anisotropy @xcite , irreversibility lines and superconducting parameters @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the physical properties are determined by the amount of sodium and water in @xmath2 via their influence on the co valence state and the resulting local distortions of the @xmath7 octahedra present in the structure .",
    "the compound @xmath0 shows manifestations of frustration in its physical properties , because co occupies a triangular lattice and the exchange interactions are antiferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "the close relationship between structural and electronic properties establishes itself also on the fermi - surface that is expected to show features of strong nesting @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there exists evidence that superconductivity might have an unconventional order parameter @xcite .",
    "when water is introduced into the compound , it exhibits chemical and structural instabilities .",
    "the @xmath8 ions are at least partially mobile at elevated temperatures and may order at low temperatures in dependence of composition and sample treatment .",
    "the same is proposed for the @xmath9 charge state on the triangular lattice @xcite .",
    "all of these features make the study of the physical and chemical properties of the compounds difficult .",
    "however , nearly all the studies reported so far have been made on either sintered specimens or poorly characterized polycrystalline samples .",
    "these materials are often found to be inhomogeneous , especially with respect to the distribution of @xmath10 ions in the lattice and in the intergranular spaces , the @xmath11 decomposition of the compound , and with respect to the intercalation of water . in polycrystalline samples water",
    "may in part accumulate in intergranular spaces .",
    "the possible presence of second phases leaves a degree of uncertainty when interpreting the structure and the electrical and superconducting properties as function of composition , i.e. establishing a superconducting phase diagram .",
    "this problem may be circumvented by the use of high quality single crystals whose chemical composition and crystal structure can be properly determined .",
    "when growing @xmath0 single crystals , considerable difficulties appear on account of the high @xmath11 vapor pressure , which increases exponentially from @xmath12 to @xmath13 torr with heating to temperatures between 500 and 800 @xmath14c , followed by a noticeable evaporation .",
    "therefore ceramic powders were synthesized using additional @xmath15 for compensation of the na loss during heating @xcite or a `` rapid heat - up '' technique @xcite to avoid the formation of a non - stoichiometric compound .",
    "solution growth by using nacl flux @xcite was performed that unfortunately lead only to thin crystals ( @xmath160.03 mm ) or non - stoichiometric and possibly contaminated samples . to obtain the superconducting phase the crystal",
    "must be hydrated by chemical oxidation @xcite . the compound can be partially decomposed during the oxidation process , leading to highly defective crystals containing na - poor phases . in this contribution",
    "we present a single crystal growth method to prepare large and high quality single crystals and demonstrate their chemical , thermal , and structural behavior and electric properties under dry and humid conditions .",
    "single crystals were grown in an optical floating zone furnace ( crystal system incorporation , japan ) with 4 x 300  w halogen lamps installed as infrared radiation sources . starting feed and seed materials",
    "were prepared from @xmath17 and @xmath18 of 99.9% purity with the nominal composition of @xmath0 , where _ _ x__=0.50 , 0.60 , 0.70 , 0.75 , 0.80 , 0.85 and 0.90 , respectively .",
    "well - mixed powders were loaded into alumina crucibles and heated at 750  @xmath14c for a day .",
    "the heated powders were reground and calcined at 850  @xmath14c for another day .",
    "they were then shaped into cylindrical bars of @xmath19 6x100 mm by pressing at an isostatic pressure of @xmath1970  mpa and then sintered at 850 @xmath14c for one day in flowing oxygen to form feed rods .",
    "the sintered feed rod was premelted with a mirror scanning velocity of 27 mm / h by travelling the upper and lower shafts , respectively , to densify the feed rod .",
    "after premelting the @xmath1920  mm rod long was cut and used as a first seed and hereafter the grown crystal was used as a seed .",
    "the feed rod and the growing crystal were rotated at 15  rpm in opposite directions . in an attempt to reduce the volatilization of na and",
    "obtain stoichiometric and large crystals , we applied travelling rates of 2  mm / h under pure oxygen flow of 200 ml / min throughout the growing procedure .    to obtain superconductivity the na",
    "was partly extracted by placing crystals in a 6.6  mol @xmath20 solution during 100 hours and then washed out the solution by @xmath21 or @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the electrochemical technique was also applied , using an aqueous solution of naoh as an electrolyte to partially extract na @xcite .",
    "this technique needs a longer time for deintercalation and the resulting superconducting transitions are generally sharper .",
    "thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis ( tg - dta ) was performed to study the melting behavior as well as the time and temperature dependence of the water loss in the compound .",
    "single crystal xrd measurements were carried out with the x - ray diffractometer ( philips pw 1710 ) using cu @xmath23 radiation , a scanning rate of 0.02 degrees per minute , and @xmath24 - 2 @xmath24 scans from 5 to 90 degrees .",
    "the lattice parameters obtained from xrd data were refined using the commercial program powdercell .",
    "the chemical composition was determined by energy dispersive x - ray ( edx ) including microanalysis .",
    "the as - grown crystals were cleaved parallel to the _ a _ axis and the composition of na and co was determined across the cleaved section .",

    "two peaks with onset @xmath28=1035 @xmath14c and @xmath29=1092 @xmath14c on the dta curve correlate very well with a weight loss observed by tg , as shown in figs . [ 1](a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "no weight changes were observed below 980 @xmath14c .",
    "the high temperature optical microscope study of the crystal reveals that the liquid phase appears at @xmath30=1035 @xmath14c but the solid phase ( crystal ) still remains up to @xmath29=1092 @xmath14c , exhibiting a coexistence of solid and liquid phases .",
    "our investigations indicate that thermal decomposition of @xmath27 is accompanied by a weight loss down to 96.2 wt.% and the compound decomposes into a sodium - rich liquid and a cobalt - rich solid phase @xcite , assuming chemical reaction of the melt as follows , @xmath0 @xmath31 coo + liquid ( na - rich ) + _ _ x__o@xmath32 - ( t@xmath331100 @xmath14c ) @xmath31 [ @xmath34 * ( * = homogeneous melt ) .",
    "the dissolution of coo occurs in the na - rich melt and by taking up oxygen from the environment .",
    "thus , it results in an increase of weight because the oxidation state of cobalt is significantly higher in the melt , i.e. , @xmath35 , according to the chemical reaction equation shown above . a sharp weight loss down to 95.5",
    "wt.% occurs at @xmath29=1092 @xmath14c and the melt starts to get homogeneous and stable . a nearly constant weight of 95.5 - 94.9 wt.% is obtained in the temperature range of 1120 - 1200 @xmath14c , where the melt becomes homogeneous .",
    "a monotonic weight loss of melt may happen under constant heating .",
    "evidently , the melting behavior described so far indicates that the compound melts incongruently .      when sintering @xmath0 at high temperatures the decomposition of @xmath11 can cause a weight loss and lead to an inhomogeneous compound . during growth a white powder of @xmath11",
    "is observed to volatilize and deposit on the inner wall of the quartz tube . by weighing a total weight loss @xmath196 wt.%",
    "is estimated .",
    "this value is in agreement with the data shown in fig . [",

    "the main loss of @xmath11 is found during the premelting procedure , estimated to be @xmath195 wt.% .",
    "this is probably caused by incompletely reacted @xmath11 when the mixtures are calcined and sintered prior to premelting .",
    "an additional @xmath191 wt.% loss is estimated after the crystal growth .    during growth",

    "crystal grains are found to grow preferably along the _ a _ crystallographic axis , parallel to the rod axis .",
    "a convex growth interface is observed to be the boundary between the regions of smaller and larger diameter of the crystal ingot , as shown in fig . [ 3 ] .",
    "the smaller one is formed when the molten zone was at lower temperatures and the larger one is formed at higher temperatures .",
    "therefore , the unequal diameter for an ingot indicates that temperature fluctuations occurred at the molten zone during growth . according to the temperature - composition relationship",
    "a fluctuation of heating temperature may result in a composition change of the molten zone , leading to an inhomogeneous compound .",
    "figure [ 3 ] ( a ) shows that many tiny crystal grains of @xmath37 gather at the boundary of the growth front .",

    "it is found that the na content varied with the temperature fluctuations during growth . at the beginning of the growth",
    "the temperature fluctuations are high and cause a high variation of the composition , @xmath42x@xmath190.11 , determined within 2  cm from the seeding part of the ingot . following the seeding part the variation of na content is smaller , @xmath42x@xmath190.06 , when the molten zone is maintained in a stable state by a constant temperature .",
    "a volatilized white @xmath11 powder accumulates on the inner wall of the quartz tube after the growth is completed .",
    "the loss of na may result to a reduction of its concentration in the as grown crystal .",
    "the white @xmath11 powders also form on the surface of crystals if the samples are stored under ambient conditions .",
    "therefore the grown crystals must be stored in an evacuated container or a desiccator to avoid decomposition .      the superconducting phase @xmath2 ( 0.26@xmath43 _ _ x__@xmath43 0.42 , y@xmath191.3 ) is obtained by chemically extracting ( deintercalation ) sodium from @xmath0 , followed by hydration .",
    "single crystals of @xmath44 were placed in the oxidizing agent @xmath45 for around 100  hours , and then washed with acetonitrile .",
    "the change of sodium content of the resulting crystals is generally proportional to the bromine concentration in the @xmath46 agent @xcite . a crystal of @xmath36 with _",

    "the na extraction of the compound was also carried out by the electrochemical method .",
    "the composition @xmath47 could be achieved in aqueous solution of naoh using a constant current of 0.5  ma and a voltage of 1.0  v for over 10 days . comparing",
    "the published 1 to 5 days extraction time for the @xmath27 powders @xcite the crystal needs longer time to complete the extraction , also depending on the dimension of the sample . the slower extraction reaction in single crystals compared to a powder",
    "is related to the higher perfection and longer period of na - o - na within the nao layers . in powder samples variations of the bonding",
    "are expected on a nanometer scale . before and after the extraction treatment the sodium composition distribution across the crystals was determined by edx .     and ( b ) fully hydrated @xmath48 . ]",
    "the superconducting phase is then obtained by immersing the deintercalated samples for a week in @xmath49 , or sealing the samples in a water vapor saturated container at room temperature .",
    "after hydration / deuteration a large increase in thickness is visible to the naked eyes and the morphology exhibits `` booklet''-like layered cracks perpendicular to the _ c _ axis .",
    "the sodium intercalant layer expands with decreasing na content , because the na removal results in co oxidation ( @xmath50 ions oxidized to smaller @xmath51 ions ) and thus the @xmath37 layers are expected to shrink @xcite .",
    "this suggests that a decreased bonding interaction between layers with decreasing na content may result in a readily cleaving plane .",
    "figures [ 5](a ) and ( b ) illustrate the layered structures of the non- and fully hydrated phases of the compound , respectively .",
    "according to the layered structure of @xmath52 @xcite , 24 co - o bonds in the layer of @xmath37 form an octahedral @xmath7 with high bonding energy and therefore the layer is structurally robust , while the bonding energy is much weaker in the nao layer because the @xmath8 mobility is high and the number of bonds na1-o is 6 and na2-o only 4/3 .",
    "therefore the na layer readily collapses to leave the @xmath37 layer terminated as the outer - most surface of the crystal .",
    "moreover , the insertion of water induces two additional intercalated layers of @xmath21 between nao and @xmath37 , i.e. , from co - na - co to @xmath53 , which results in the expansion of the c lattice constant from 11.2 to 19.6   .",
    "the hydrogen in the new intercalated @xmath21 layer bonds extremely weakly to the nao and coo layers .",
    "therefore this compound is exceptionally unstable with respect to a change of thermal , mechanical or humidity environment . under ambient ,",
