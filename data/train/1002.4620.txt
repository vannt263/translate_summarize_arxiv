    "damped lyman-@xmath0 systems ( dlas ) are the highest h  i column density absorbers seen in qso spectra , with @xmath1(h  i)@xmath18 @xmath19 , over cosmological time - scales .",
    "these absorbers trace the bulk of neutral hydrogen at @xmath20 ( for example see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have long been identified as revealing the interstellar medium of the high - redshift precursors of present day galaxies ( for a review see , * ? ? ?",
    "the physical conditions in the diffuse interstellar gas are influenced by a number of physical processes including in - situ star - formation , cosmic ray interaction , photoelectric heating by dust as well as mechanical energy input from both impulsive disturbances like supernova explosions and steady injection of energy in the form of stellar winds .",
    "therefore , studies of the physical conditions in dlas provide a probe of the cosmological evolution of normal galaxies selected solely based on h  i cross - section .",
    "our understanding of physical conditions in dlas is primarily derived from optical absorption - line studies , involving the detection of low - ionization metal transitions and , in some cases , molecular absorption [ e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , for h@xmath21 , and @xcite and @xcite for co ] .",
    "the gas in which h@xmath21 is detected , has typical temperature and density of 150@xmath280  k and @xmath22 = 10@xmath23200 @xmath9 respectively .",
    "these conditions correspond to those prevailing in a cold neutral medium ( cnm ) embedded in a radiation field of moderate intensity originating from local star formation activity @xcite .",
    "detecting 21-cm absorption in dlas is one complementary way to probe the physical conditions in the absorbing gas .",
    "if detected , the 21-cm optical depth , in conjunction with the observed @xmath1(h  i ) from optical data , gives the spin temperature of the h  i gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "it is widely believed that the latter is a good tracer of the kinetic temperature .",
    "the width of the 21-cm line observed at very high spectral resolution can also yield a direct measurement ( or give a stringent upper limit on ) of the kinetic temperature ( as , for example , in the = 1.3603 system towards j  2340@xmath230053 , * ? ? ?",
    "this can be combined with measurements of c  i , c  ii , si  ii and/or o  i fine - structure lines to derive the gas density @xcite .    by measuring the relative positions of absorption lines it is possible to constrain the time variation of several dimensionless constants .",
    "accurately measured wavelengths of 2 absorption lines allow one to constrain the variation of the proton - to - electron mass ratio @xcite .",
    "the position of the 21-cm absorption line can be compared to those of the corresponding metal line components to probe the variations of a combination , @xmath24 , of the fine structure constant ( @xmath0 ) , the proton - to - electron mass ratio ( @xmath12 ) and the proton gyromagnetic factor ( @xmath25 , * ? ? ?",
    "simultaneous detection of h@xmath21 , 21-cm and metal absorption line in the same system can , in principle , allow one to lift part of the degeneracy between the variations of these different constants .    despite obvious advantages ,",
    "till recently , there was only one system ( at @xmath26  =  1.7765 towards q  1331 + 170 , * ? ? ? * ) known to produce both h@xmath21 and 21-cm absorption lines . due to the low redshift of the system",
    ", however , it is not possible to cover the h@xmath21 lyman and werner band absorption with high resolution spectroscopy at high enough signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this prevents one from performing a detailed analysis of the cloud . in the course of our on - going gbt",

    "this system is unique as both 21-cm absorption and 2 are extremely rare in dlas at @xmath283 .",

    "we used two settings with two different central wavelengths in the blue ( 390 nm and 437 nm ) and red ( 600 nm and 770 nm ) arms to cover the wavelength range 3300@xmath239590   with a single gap between 7590 and 7769   .",
    "the ccd pixels were binned @xmath31 and the slit width adjusted to @xmath32 , yielding a resolving power of @xmath33 under median seeing conditions of @xmath34 . the total exposure time on source is 4  hrs .",
    "the data were reduced using the uves pipeline @xcite , which is available in the context of the eso midas data reduction system .",
    "wavelengths were rebinned to the heliocentric rest frame and individual scientific exposures co - added using a sliding window and weighting the signal by the inverse of the variance in each pixel .",
    "the resultant combined spectrum has a snr in the range 10 - 20 per pixel .",
    "we fitted the quasar continuum using low order polynomials in line free continuum regions .",
    "we analysed the spectrum using standard voigt profile fitting procedures .",
    "the atomic data used are from @xcite unless otherwise specified . in the following ,",
    "we adopt the solar photospheric abundances from @xcite , rest wavelengths and oscillator strengths of 2 transitions from @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "there are three high-@xmath1(h  i ) absorption systems within 2500   along this line of sight at @xmath26  =  3.17448 ( @xmath35  ) , 3.16768 ( @xmath36  ) and 3.1408 ( @xmath37  ) .",
    "the corresponding lyman series absorption lines are shown on a velocity scale in fig .",
    "[ lyman ] .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 profile is dominated by the  =  3.17448 system .",
    "as the red wing of this absorption is affected by the qso lyman-@xmath0 emission , we do not use it to derive @xmath1(h  i ) but use instead lyman-@xmath38 and other higher order lines .",
    "the lyman-@xmath38 line of the @xmath26  =  3.17448 and 3.16768 systems ( referred to as system-1 and system-2 from now on ) are blended together .",
    "some of the higher order lyman lines of system-1 are blended with lines from the sub - dla at = 3.1408 ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "the main constraint on log  @xmath1(h  i ) in system-1 comes from the red wing of the lyman-@xmath38 absorption and the core of the lyman-@xmath40 absorption . in the case of system-2 ,",
    "the blue wing of lyman-@xmath38 and the red wing of lyman-@xmath40 are used for the same purpose .",
    "we obtain log  @xmath1(h  i)= 21.36@xmath20.10 and 20.41@xmath20.15 for system-1 and system-2 respectively .",
    "note that errors come mostly from continuum placement uncertainties .",
    "we discuss the fits to the h  i lines for system-2 in greater detail below ( see sect .  5 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the unblended wings of the higher lyman series lines are used to constrain the velocity dispersion .",
    "in addition , based on the absence of damping wings in lyman-@xmath38 and the blue wing of the lyman-@xmath0 absorption lines we derive an upper limit of @xmath41  @xmath19 for @xmath1(h  i ) at = 3.1408 ( @xmath42  @xmath43  ) . we can not perform a more precise measurement as all the available transitions are saturated , hiding the component structure .",
    "we therefore do not discuss this system any further .",
    "weak 2 and strong 21-cm absorptions are seen associated with this system in the uves and gmrt spectra , respectively .",
    "the gmrt spectrum covers only the expected 21-cm range for system-1 . in the higher resolution gmrt spectrum the absorption is spread over 7 - 8 channels and can be adequately fitted with a single gaussian component of peak optical depth @xmath44  =  0.40@xmath20.02 located at 340.2593@xmath20.0002mhz ( or  =  @xmath45 ) and fwhm  =  5.08@xmath20.34kms@xmath29 ( see middle panel in fig .",

    "we use the rms flux measured in the line free channels as typical error in each channel .",
    "the best fit has a reduced @xmath46 = 1.02 .",
    "the fwhm of the fitted gaussian component corresponds to a kinetic temperature of @xmath4776k .",
    "motivated by the fact that the centroid of the 2 absorption does not coincide with the centroid of the 21-cm absorption ( see below ) , we performed a fit with two components .",
    "the result of this fit is shown in the bottom panel of fig  [ 21cmabs ] .",
    "the best fitted two components have @xmath26  =  3.174492@xmath20.000007 and 3.174451@xmath20.000012 with fwhm  =  3.4@xmath20.9 and 3.1@xmath21.6   respectively .",
    "these values translate to upper limits on kinetic temperatures of 252 and 210  k respectively .",
    "the reduced @xmath46 in this case is 0.87 .",
    "this , as well as the residuals seen in fig .",
    "[ 21cmabs ] , suggest that the two component model is probably over - fitting the data .",
    "the h  i column density of an optically thin cloud covering a fraction @xmath48 of a background radio source is related to the 21-cm optical depth @xmath49 in a velocity interval ( @xmath50 , @xmath51d@xmath50 ) and to the spin temperature ( @xmath52 ) by @xmath53 the total optical depth is @xmath54 = 2.08@xmath20.17 .",
    "thus the total h  i column density is , @xmath1(h  i )  =  ( 3.82@xmath20.31)@xmath55(@xmath56)@xmath19 . from our optical spectrum",
    "we measure log  @xmath1(h  i )  =  21.36@xmath20.10 . for @xmath57 ,",

    "the radio source is represented by a single component with flux density 83mjy and a deconvolved size of 0.75@xmath62 .",
    "it is compact as well in our gmrt 610-mhz image with similar resolution with a flux density of @xmath3102mjy .",

    "this radio source has a flux density of 29mjy , very similar to the class / jvas 8ghz image .",
    "therefore , from the arcsecond and sub - arcsecond scale images available , the source appears to be core dominated with an indication of the low - frequency turnover .",
    "we have no reason to believe the covering factor is not close to unity .",
    "the spin temperature measured here is in between the expected kinetic temperatures of cold ( @xmath64 k ) and warm ( 5000@xmath238000 k ) neutral media @xcite .",
    "thus , what we measure can be interpreted as the harmonic mean temperature of the multiphase medium along the line of sight .",
    "interestingly the spin temperature we measure here is consistent with the mean spin temperature measured in very low redshift qso - galaxy pairs @xcite .",
    ".results of single component fits to h@xmath21 lines in system-1 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath65 solar photospheric abundances are from asplund et al .",
    "( 2009 )    [ tab_met2 ]    table  [ tab_met2 ] summarises the total column densities of neutral and low ionization species and the corresponding metallicities measured in this system assuming no ionization correction .",
    "the oxygen metallicity is one of the lowest known among dlas and sub - dlas ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we remind the reader that the low oxygen metallicity can not be due to ionization effects because o  i is known to be coupled tightly with h  i through charge exchange reactions .",
    "actually the carbon , silicon , aluminium and iron metallicities estimated from the singly ionized species are consistent with [ o / h ] .",
    "the system is of low - ionization .",
    "we detect the si  iii@xmath661206 line and measure log  @xmath1(si  iii )  =  13.28@xmath20.06 , but the si  iv absorption is very weak ( see fig .  [ highion ] ) .",
    "therefore , in any case the silicon abundance is [ si / h ]  @xmath67  @xmath68 .",
    "the spectrum covers the expected position of c  iii@xmath66987 but this line is blended with intervening lyman-@xmath0 absorptions ( see fig .",
    "[ highion ] ) . c  iv absorption is also weak .",
    "the column density of c  ii implies [ c / o]@xmath69 .",
    "this value contradicts the result of standard galactic chemical evolution models ( see @xcite ) expecting the carbon metallicity to be much smaller than the oxygen metallicity ( i.e [ c / o ]  @xmath67  @xmath70 ) for [ o / h ]  @xmath67  @xmath71 .",
    "however , our result is consistent with results by @xcite and supports the suggestion by @xcite that carbon and oxygen may be produced in near - solar proportions in the earliest stages of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "chemical evolution models with population  iii stars ( @xcite ) or with fast rotating stars ( @xcite ) produce near solar [ c / o ] at low metallicities",
    ".    the spectrum does not show detectable absorption lines of n  i. hence , we only derive an upper limit for @xmath1(n  i ) .",
    "the expected wavelength range for n  ii@xmath661083 is affected by intervening lyman-@xmath0 absorption from the igm .",
    "using n  i / o  i we derive [ n / o]@xmath72 - 0.89 .",
    "this is not stringent enough to draw conclusions regarding the contribution to the nitrogen metallicity from primary and secondary productions .",
    "based on the [ fe/@xmath0 ] abundance ratio we can conclude that there is no dust depletion in the gas .",
    "the absence of 2 absorption could very well be attributed to the lack of dust in the system .",
    "the lack of @xmath0 element enhancement also means that the star formation activity is not recent .",
    "in addition , this also undermines the contribution of population  iii stars to overall enrichment .      while fitting the lyman series absorption lines , we find a clear excess absorption in the blue wing of all the available lyman transitions ( see fig .",
    "[ dbyhfig ] ) .",
    "the total h  i column density is well constrained by the damping wings of lyman-@xmath38 and lyman-@xmath40 .",
    "the uncertainty in its measurement comes from the error propagated through the voigt profile fits to the lyman-@xmath38 absorption of system-1 and from continuum placement .",
    "the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ dbyhfig ] also shows a typical continuum used near the wavelength range covered by lyman-@xmath38 line .",
    "this was determined using the sdss composite qso spectrum @xcite with appropriate scaling to fit the line free regions .",
    "we constrain the velocity dispersion by using the red wings of lyman-@xmath40 and @xmath74 and using the blue wings of lyman-6 , lyman-7 and lyman-8 .",
    "we notice that the resulting best fitting voigt profiles ( dotted profiles in fig .  [ dbyhfig ] ) under - predict the blue wing absorption at @xmath3@xmath2382 for lyman-@xmath40 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "consistent absorption dips are present at similar velocity in the blue sides of higher lyman series lines .",
    "we do not find any metal line absorption at this velocity ( see fig .",
    "[ metal_z2 ] ) .",
    "it is also clear from fig .",
    "[ lyman ] that the excess can not be explained by blending with lyman series lines from the other two strong h  i absorption systems seen in the immediate vicinity .",
    "thus it is most likely that the excess absorption in the blue wings of h  i lines is due to d  i.    we simultaneously fit the d  i lyman series lines with three components at the redshifts of the three strongest o  i components that contain @xmath76 of the o  i column density .",
    "we varied @xmath1 and @xmath77 for the d  i lines to get the best fit .",

    ", it is believed that [ d / h ] will be close to [ d / h]@xmath80 .",

    "if the deuterium absorption features are due to intervening lyman-@xmath0 clouds , the astration factor must be even larger .",

    "thus it appears that the astration factor of deuterium varies largely from one system to the other at a given metallicity .",
    "therefore , it may not be a good idea to remove the so - called outliers while computing the weighted mean value of [ d / h ] measured in absorption line systems .",
    "we have presented detailed analysis of two very closely spaced dlas ( at = 3.17447 and 3.16768 ) within a velocity separation of @xmath3500 along the line of sight to sdss  j1337 + 3152 .",

    "we note however a velocity shift of @xmath32.7  km / s between the 2 and 21-cm absorption , revealing small scale inhomogeneities in the cloud that could wash out detection of a variation in @xmath85 .",
    "such systematics can only be alleviated with a large sample of such systems .",
