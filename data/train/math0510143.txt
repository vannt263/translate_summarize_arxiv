    "we study the entropic repulsion of a class of real valued gaussian random fields @xmath10 which can be interpreted as a @xmath1-dimensional ( discrete ) interface in a @xmath11-dimensional space .",
    "entropic repulsion refers to the fact that the presence of a wall forces the random surface to move away from the wall , in order to gain space for local fluctuations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in our case ,",
    "the wall is simply the @xmath1-dimensional coordinate hyperplane , and the effect of the wall is described by requiring the field @xmath12 to be positive in a certain region .",
    "a basic object to study is the asymptotics of the probability @xmath13 , @xmath14 finite , when @xmath15 its behaviour is well understood in the case where @xmath12 is the ( lattice ) gaussian free field in dimension @xmath16 ( see @xcite ) , which is the gibbs measure with formal hamiltonian @xmath17 the free field has a simple random walk representation of the covariances , which enables one to calculate various conditional distributions in an easy way .",
    "the main aim of the present paper is to extend the analysis to a class of fields with a more general hamiltonian which includes the so - called membrane models .",
    "the crucial difference is that these models do not possess a random walk representation .",
    "the only mathematically rigorous result on these models we are aware of is the paper by sakagawa @xcite , who derived lower and upper bounds for @xmath18 his bounds however do nt match .",
    "we derive here an upper bound which asymptotically matches sakagawa s lower bound , and therefore we prove that his lower bound gives the correct leading order of the asymptotics .",
    "this first result then enables us to compute the exact height to which the average of the field is pushed by the wall .",
    "let @xmath19 we consider the ( formal ) hamiltonian @xmath20 given by @xmath21 with @xmath22 for @xmath23 the discrete laplacian @xmath3 is the operator on @xmath24 defined by @xmath25 if @xmath26 is odd , we set @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the discrete gradient in the @xmath29th direction .",
    "the free field is thus the special case @xmath30 we make the following assumptions :    * @xmath31 where @xmath32 * @xmath33 satisfies @xmath34 for @xmath35    under assumptions @xmath36 and @xmath37 the infinite - volume gibbs measure corresponding to @xmath38 exists ( see @xcite , section 2 ) .",
    "it can be described as follows : for @xmath39 and @xmath40 set @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the identity matrix on @xmath43 and @xmath3 the matrix laplacian defined by @xmath44 the above assumptions ensure that , for @xmath45 small enough , the matrix @xmath46 is positive definite with positive definite inverse @xmath47 we set @xmath48 and @xmath49 from @xcite , chapter 13 , we know that the centred gaussian field with covariance matrix @xmath50 exists .",
    "we denote its law by @xmath51 it is characterised by the following dlr - equation as an infinite - volume gibbs measure , and corresponds to the hamiltonian ( [ hamilton ] ) : @xmath52 where we use the notation @xmath53 for the @xmath54field generated by @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the gaussian distribution with mean @xmath58 and variance @xmath59 if @xmath60 for all @xmath61 then @xmath62 satisfies the fkg - inequalities ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we make the additional assumption    * there exists a sequence @xmath63 of positive numbers such that @xmath64 and @xmath65 for all @xmath66 and all @xmath67    throughout the paper we will always assume that @xmath68 and @xmath69 hold .",
    "now set @xmath70^d$ ] and @xmath71 we consider the entropic repulsion event @xmath72 theorem 2.1 of @xcite states that there exist constants @xmath73 such that @xmath74 holds .",
    "moreover , the constant @xmath75 has been identified to be @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the @xmath78th order capacity of the unit cube @xmath79 @xmath80 being the minimal degree of the polynomial @xmath81 this lower bound was proved using a relative entropy argument and the fkg - property of @xmath62 . assumption ( c ) above is necessary for this proof . in the case of the free field ,",
    "the statement [ thmsaka ] was proved before in @xcite .",
    "there it was shown in addition that in this case the constants @xmath75 and @xmath82 of the upper and the lower bound coincide .",
    "our first result shows that this is still true for our model :    [ thmer ]    for @xmath31    @xmath83    where @xmath84 is given by ( [ constsaka ] ) , and @xmath85    in the next section , we will prove the upper bound of ( [ er ] ) .",
    "together with ( [ thmsaka ] ) and ( [ constsaka ] ) this proves theorem [ thmer ] .",
    "thus the decay of @xmath86 for @xmath87 is completely analogous to the case @xmath88 using theorem [ thmer ] , we can then prove the height estimate for the averaged field :    [ thmheight ] let @xmath89 and @xmath90 then @xmath91 where @xmath92 and @xmath93    the lower bound for this height estimate was obtained in @xcite .",
    "our exact result in theorem [ thmer ] allows us now to give the correct upper bound .",
    "this means that , as expected , the local sample mean of the field is pushed to @xmath94 by the hard wall .",
    "we follow a strategy introduced in @xcite , which was used in @xcite for the case @xmath95 the idea is to use a conditioning argument on larger boxes than those of the proof of @xcite . the main difficulty  when trying to follow the proof for the free field ",
    "arises when considering the expectations of @xmath96 conditioned on the boundary of a box of side - length @xmath97 while in the case of the harmonic crystal , we know by the random walk representation , that on @xmath98 the conditional expectations are nonnegative , in our more general case they can be strictly negative .",
    "we overcome this difficulty by estimating the proportion of conditional expectations that are of order @xmath99 then we prove that this proportion is negligible if we let @xmath6 tend to infinity .",

    "to prove theorem [ thmheight ] , there are two directions to show .",
    "the first was proved in theorem 2.2 of @xcite : for any @xmath191 and @xmath192 such that @xmath193    @xmath194    we will now use theorem [ thmer ] to show the other bound :    [ oben ] for any @xmath195 and @xmath196 with @xmath197 @xmath198    the proof for the lattice free field in @xcite uses the fkg - inequality for the conditional measure , which does not hold in our case . similarly to section 2 , we can handle this problem by carefully estimating the probability that , on @xmath199 the local sample mean of the field is higher than @xmath200 this is done by comparing    @xmath201 with the average of the conditional expectations @xmath202    first , let @xmath203 set @xmath204 and @xmath205 fix @xmath149 as in section 2 and recall the definition of the subgrid @xmath206 the boxes @xmath207 and their @xmath208boundary @xmath209 in this section , @xmath210 denotes the set @xmath211 and @xmath212 for @xmath124 and @xmath213 let @xmath214 be defined as in section 2 , and set @xmath215 where @xmath216^d.$ ] set @xmath217 and @xmath218 as before , set @xmath219 for @xmath220    we want to estimate @xmath221 recall @xmath222 from section 3 , fix @xmath223 and set @xmath224 then we can write @xmath225    we have seen in the last section that the first term is negligible compared to @xmath226 for the second part , recall that conditioned on @xmath227 , the @xmath228 are independent centred gaussian variables with variance @xmath229 thus for the variance of the average we get @xmath230 we can therefore find constants @xmath231 and @xmath232 such that @xmath233 which is also negligible compared with @xmath226 therefore we only need to estimate @xmath234    for this purpose we bound @xmath235 from below on @xmath236 write @xmath237 and recall from the last section , that on @xmath238 @xmath239 for any @xmath240 and @xmath241 this implies that on @xmath242 we have @xmath243    since we can repeat this argument with any shift of the subgrid @xmath244 and average over all shifts , we conclude that on @xmath245 @xmath246    from now on we will abbreviate @xmath247 by @xmath248 for @xmath249 set @xmath250 it follows from ( [ abschphi ] ) that , on @xmath242 for every @xmath251 we can find @xmath252 and @xmath253 such that , for @xmath254 @xmath255 let @xmath256 @xmath257 defining @xmath188 as in the last section , we have @xmath258 and @xmath259    similarly to the end of section 2 , we can then optimise over @xmath260 use proposition [ konstanten ] , and let @xmath261 and @xmath155 tend to 0 . then we see that there is a constant @xmath262 such that @xmath263 now we apply theorem [ thmer ] , and obtain @xmath264which proves the claim in the case @xmath265 the case of an arbitrary @xmath266 is obtained by repeating the same arguments on a shifted grid .",
    "theorem [ thmheight ] now follows immediately from ( [ unten ] ) and proposition [ oben ] .",

    "the local central limit theorem for the simple random walk yields a decay of order @xmath270 ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in our model , we do not have a random walk representation , since the entries of the `` transition matrix '' @xmath271 can be negative .",
