    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is one of the most appealing extensions of the standard model with a mechanism to protect the higgs mass from radiative corrections , realizable high scale gauge coupling unification  @xcite , and a candidate for the cold dark matter of the universe , even when the so - called discrete @xmath2-parity symmetry is broken .",
    "furthermore , the mechanism of electroweak baryogenesis can be employed to explain the matter - antimatter asymmetry in the universe and one has the appealing mechanism for radiative electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb )  @xcite .",
    "one of the open issues in the mssm is the origin of supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking ( see ref .",

    "gauge mediation  @xcite is one of the most appealing mechanisms to address this issue .",
    "superpartner masses are predicted assuming the existence of a susy breaking hidden sector .",
    "this breaking is then transmitted to the mssm sector through gauge interactions via messenger fields .",
    "this process generates masses for all superpartner masses and avoids the so - called flavor problem in susy theories since mixings between the sfermions of different families are not generated .    in this paper",
    "we present a simple scenario for gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking where the messengers are also the fields that generate neutrino masses .",
    "we refer to this scenario as  \" .",
    "we build up to this scenario by discussing previous implementations of gauge mediation through the already existing particle content of the simplest @xmath3 supersymmetric grand unified theories ( gut ) .",
    "since it is expected that in such models we will also generate neutrino masses in a consistent way , we then consider seesaw extensions of @xmath3 .",
    "the so called seesaw fields can also mediate susy breaking and since the seesaw scale , @xmath4 gev , is much smaller than the gut scale , @xmath5 gev , the seesaw contributions will dominate the susy breaking masses .",
    "this idea was first discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we investigate this hypothesis discussing all possible scenarios for gauge mediation in the context of @xmath3 theories and find that neutrino mass generation through both the type i and type iii seesaw mechanisms provides the simplest framework for gauge mediation via seesaw fields .",
    "we then pursue this idea in detail , finding that the spectrum depends on four parameters and that while the bilinear higgs term is very small at the messenger scale , it can run to acceptable values for electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) at the susy scale .",
    "we obtain a constrained susy spectrum whose phenomenological aspects are then discussed .    in section",
    "ii we discuss the different implementation of the gauge mediation mechanism for supersymmetry breaking in the context of @xmath3 grand unified theories . in section iii",
    "we discuss the predictions for superpartner masses in the case where the messengers are the fields responsible for the type iii seesaw mechanism . in section",

    "the yukawa superpotential for charged fermions reads as : @xmath11 here we assume the existence of higher - dimensional operators for consistent fermion masses .",
    "the relevant interactions for breaking @xmath3 to the sm gauge group are : @xmath12 and the interactions between the different higgs chiral superfields are : @xmath13 see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein for the status of this model .    at first sight ,",
    "the most appealing way to proceed is to break both the gut symmetry and susy with the same field , @xmath14  @xcite assuming , @xmath15 . this would lead to contributions to the soft terms from the following four sets of would - be messengers : the higgses@xmath16 and @xmath17  @xcite ; the @xmath18 color triplets@xmath19 and @xmath20 ; the components of the @xmath14@xmath21 and @xmath22 ; and the @xmath3 heavy gauge bosons @xmath23 and @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "the largest contribution by far is the first one , via the higgses , since they are the lightest of these fields .",
    "susy breaking in this case is transmitted once we generate the term @xmath25 using the scalar interactions from eq .",
    "( [ hmixing ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this possibility is ruled out due to negative leading order contributions to the sfermion masses , which produce a tachyonic stop  @xcite . while the coupling of the higgses to the @xmath14 must exist in order to achieve double - triplet splitting , it is important to note that the @xmath25 term can be eliminated by invoking extra fine - tuning on top of the fine - tuning needed for doublet - triplet splitting .",
    "we find this possibility unappealing and will not discuss it further .",
    "since the fields present in the theory can not be used to transmit susy breaking , the simplest approach is to introduce a new singlet field , @xmath26 , which couples both to the @xmath3 visible sector and to the hidden sector .",
    "we assume this singlet does not couple to @xmath16 and @xmath27 to avoid the tachyonic stop issue mentioned above . once this field gets a vev , @xmath28 ,",
    "superpartner masses can be generated .",
    "assuming that susy breaking is transmitted through the mass term for the field used to break @xmath3 to the sm , we replace @xmath29 in this case susy breaking is mediated through @xmath22 and @xmath21 , but since these fields do not carry hypercharge , the bino and right - handed charged sleptons , @xmath30 , remain massless ( at the two - loop level ) at the messenger scale while running effects would drive the latter mass to tachyonic values .",
    "a realistic susy spectrum then requires transcending the minimal model by introducing extra representations which can be used as messengers .",

    "@xcite . on the other hand type iii seesaw",
    "requires introducing only one chiral superfield , a @xmath32 , making it more minimal and worthy of study .",
    "recently , several groups have investigated the type iii seesaw mechanism in the context of @xmath3 grand unified theories  @xcite . in order to realize this mechanism one has to introduce a new matter superfield in the adjoint representation : @xmath33 in the context of non - susy @xmath3 ,",
    "this idea was pursued in a non - renormalizable model  @xcite and then in a fully renormalizable scenario  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism was studied for the first time in the context of a supersymmetric grand unified theory in ref .",

    "the spectrum can then have a normal hierarchy with @xmath48 or an inverted hierarchy with @xmath49 .    in order to transmit susy breaking in this scenario",

    ", by adding only one extra chiral superfield , @xmath32 , we are able to generate neutrino masses in agreement with experiments and have a consistent mechanism for gauge mediation since the components of the @xmath32 have color , weak and hypercharge charges",
    ". since type i seesaw can not generate masses for the superpartners and type ii seesaw needs two chiral superfields , and @xmath56 , and in general their superpotential contains the following terms : @xmath57 then , one could say that they have less parameters only when some of the interactions above , which in general are relevant , are neglected .",
    "for example , the term @xmath58 gives a mass splitting between the messengers after @xmath3 is broken . ]",
    "_ type iii seesaw provides the simplest framework for gauge mediation in @xmath3 grand unified theory via seesaw fields_. it is important to emphasize the differences between this scenario and that studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors : studied a more involved case with several copies of the @xmath59 field ; neglected the very relevant interaction ",
    "tr @xmath60 , which tells us that the seesaw scale is large ; did not discuss that neutrino masses are generated through both the type i and type iii seesaw mechanisms ; and did not consider radiative @xmath0-term generation . in our opinion , these are crucial features of our scenario which deserve attention and we investigate their effects in detail .",
    "in gauge mediation scenarios it is typically assumed that the messengers are degenerate and therefore all associated with the same contributions , @xmath61 , to the soft masses .",
    "being in a specific gut model allows us the advantage of seeing that this not necessarily true . here the messengers , the @xmath32 , attain mass splittings from eq .",
    "( [ w24 ] ) due their couplings to the @xmath3 breaking @xmath14 .",
    "the masses are given in eqs .",
    "( [ mr0]-[mr32 ] ) , where we take @xmath62 to allow for gauge mediation .",
    "since these masses differ from each other , each messenger field will have a different @xmath61 parameter associated with it : @xmath63 where @xmath64 . in this section , we will for convenience reparameterize the mass relations in terms of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "also , any phase in eqs .",
    "( [ mr0]-[mr32 ] ) can always be rotated away to yield positive values for each of the masses .",
    "then assuming no relevant phase between @xmath67 and @xmath68 leads to three possible cases for this reparameterization :    * case i :  @xmath69 ;  @xmath70 where @xmath71 , * case ii :  @xmath72 ;  @xmath73 where @xmath74 , * case iii :   @xmath75 ;  @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "for the remainder of the paper we will focus on case iii since the range of @xmath78 is the union of cases i and ii .",
    "specifically we will consider @xmath79 to reduce the fine tuning between the components of the @xmath32 .    in general",
    ", at each seesaw field threshold , the gaugino masses will receive a one - loop contribution , which must be evolved down to the next threshold , modified by the new contribution and evolved again .",
    "however , the effect from running between these thresholds is small since the messengers are never separated by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "therefore , one can simply state the gaugino masses as a boundary condition at @xmath80 . computing the gaugino masses at one - loop yields the following results at the messenger scale : @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "scalar masses are generated at two - loops and can be calculated using the same philosophy discussed for the gauginos . in general , scalar masses will also receive contributions from their yukawa couplings to the messengers .",
    "however , once these become sizable , at higher messenger scales , they lead to low energy lepton number violation . we postpone a study of this effect to a future paper and continue with the assumption that @xmath84 gev .",
    "we will use @xmath85 gev to illustrate the numerical results .",
    "this also means that as in minimal models of gmsb , the trilinear @xmath86-terms and bilinear @xmath0-term will be zero at the messenger scale but non - zero at the susy scale due to rge effects . as a result ,",
    "the boundary conditions for the scalar parameters are : @xmath87 see the appendix for our notation .",
    "it is well - known that in gauge mediation , the masses of all the generations of a given sfermion type are degenerate since they have the same charges ,",
    "_ i.e. _ @xmath88 , while yukawa effects in the running will push the third generation mass below the degenerate masses of the first and second generation .",
    "the right - handed components have different masses than the left - handed ones because of their different charges .",
    "armed with this information we are ready to study the predictions of this model , focusing on case iii .",
    "calculations are done by inputting the gauge couplings and fermion masses at the @xmath89 mass scale with a guess for @xmath90 and then evolving up to the messenger scale using one - loop renormalization group equations ( rges ) . at that scale ,",
    "the boundary conditions for the soft terms are calculated and those values are then evolved to the susy scale using one - loop rges .",
    "the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) constraints are then used to solve for @xmath91 and @xmath0 .",
    "if the @xmath0 value from the ewsb conditions does not match the one given from the rges , a new guess for @xmath90 is used and the process repeats until it converges on a value of @xmath90 .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that there are only four input parameters :    @xmath92 ,   @xmath93 ,   @xmath80  and  @xmath94 ,    so that validation of this scenario could possibly begin once three superpartner masses are known and the rest of the spectrum can be calculated .      before diving into the spectrum , it would be useful to contemplate ewsb and the @xmath95 problem .",
    "the latter arises in gmsb when generation of the @xmath91 term is linked to susy breaking , which usually results in the untenable situation @xmath96 .",
    "however , in our approach , @xmath91 is a parameter of the superpotential that arises from doublet - triplet splitting and we do not attempt to link it to susy breaking .",
    "it is common in the literature to assume a value for @xmath90 and then use the ewsb equations to solve for @xmath0 , hence indicating an ignorance of the mechanism which generates this term .",
    "we see no reason to adopt this approach since @xmath0 is radiatively generated in these susy breaking scenarios ( we refer to this as doubly radiative ewsb ) . therefore , even though @xmath0 is very close to zero at the messenger scale , an appropriate value is generated by rge running from the messenger to the susy scale .",
    "the ewsb equations can then be used to determine the appropriate value of @xmath90 and @xmath91 : @xmath97 @xmath98    satisfying these equations automatically allows for a nontrivial vacuum and guarantees that the potential is bounded from below : @xmath99 respectively .     and @xmath91 at the susy scale versus @xmath92 for @xmath100 tev and @xmath101  gev .",
