    "non - radially pulsating white dwarfs ( wds ) of da type ( dav ) , known as zz ceti stars , have up to recently almost exclusively been found as single isolated objects .",
    "however , the start of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in 2000 has enabled the discovery of several cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) harbouring pulsating primaries .",
    "spectra of faint cvs obtained from sdss have revealed a number of low - mass transfer rate dwarf nova systems with faint accretion discs , where light from the wd dominates the optical flux , hence allowing us to study low - amplitude modulations in the light - curve , induced by pulsations of the wd .",
    "thus far , 10 such cv / zz ceti hybrids have been found ; the most recent one being sdss@xmath0j133941.11 + 484727.5 ( henceforth sdss@xmath01339 ) as described by @xcite .",
    "the pulsation frequencies observed in zz ceti stars are often linear combinations of the main pulsation frequency together with eigenfrequencies of other principal driving modes , possibly described by a general numerical formula ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". for the limited number of cv / zz hybrid systems identified so far , the resonance condition appears to be slightly different from single zz ceti stars .",
    "an accreting wd can be quite unlike an isolated wd , after having undergone about @xmath2 yr of accretion and several nova eruptions .",
    "since the interior structure might be different we also expect the fingerprint frequencies of eigenmode pulsations to be different .",
    "asteroseismological analysis of non - radially pulsating wds as primaries in cvs can give us important information about structure , composition and evolution of the wd as well as the accretion process , e.g.  help us determine the mass of the primary and the accreted hydrogen layer , and improve our models of classical novae .",
    "the pulsation eigenfunctions could be affected by e.g.  accretion - induced spherical asymmetries ( due to equatorial band accretion in the low magnetic field wd primary ) , rapid rotation ( due to angular momentum transfer from accreted material ) , and temperature fluctuations ( due to outburst on long time - scales and accretion variations on shorter time - scales ) .",
    "furthermore , clumpy and non - smooth accretion flow , indicated by flickering , may induce random phase changes as it continuously excites oscillations .",
    "as the wd evolves toward the cool limit of the instability strip for davs the pulsation spectra becomes increasingly complex and unstable , with amplitudes changing considerably on time - scales of only months ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     if we combine the two runs on sdss@xmath01339 we get a peak at 1.517  mhz or 630  s. however , the accuracy in the frequency determination of each individual observation suggests that the frequency actually is changing .",
    "the period obtained in the first run is noticeably shorter than the period of 642 seconds observed by @xcite during measurements in 2005 april ( even taking into account our much shorter run time ) , while our second observation gave a distinctly longer period . although one could suspect such a difference in the measured main pulsation period to be caused by effects of flickering or perhaps excitation of a nearby mode",
    ", one might also argue that this is a real drift of the main pulsation mode .",
    "intermittent onset of mass transfer caused by thermal instabilities in the accretion disc can occur on a regular basis once every few months and last for about a week , eventually leading to a build - up and sedimentation of matter , which will cause compressional heating of the wd and consequently change the eigenmode frequencies .",
    "a decrease in the observed pulsation period might well be a sign of an approaching dwarf novae ( dn ) outburst , as heating of the wd core through material compression usually takes place just prior to unstable ignition @xcite .",
    "another contributing factor could be influence from simmering nuclear burning affecting mode periods and period spacings @xcite .",
    "gw lib can serve as an illustration of the opposite effect where the mode frequencies drift because of cooling of freshly accreted material after a dn outburst .",
    "calculations by @xcite match the frequency decrease of the periodicity near 646 s observed for gw lib by @xcite quite well .",
    "the observed variation , @xmath3 , at the specific frequency 1/646 hz , gives an increase in the mode period by roughly 10 s per month @xcite .",
    "for an isolated zz ceti the period change is directly related to the evolutionary time - scale , thus the periods are very stable .",
    "another example of observed rapid period variability is the pulsating central wd of the planetary nebula ngc@xmath0246 which has shown a change of 130 @xmath4hz in just 3  d , perhaps implying that it is a member of a binary system @xcite .",
    ", @xmath5 and @xmath6 filters are given by the gunn pass - bands centred around 520 , 670 and 790 nm , respectively . ]",
    "the pulse shape of the main pulsation in sdss@xmath01514 is nearly sinusoidal .",
    "deviations from the sinusoidal shape and linear combinations of frequencies in the fourier spectrum may be a result of non - linear effects , perhaps due to perturbations in the convection zone ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for review on non - linear processes ) . due to the non - pulsating contribution by the accretion disc , it is difficult to determine the actual pulsation amplitude in hybrid systems .",
    "amplitude variations on time - scales of just days is a frequent feature of wd pulsators near the red edge of the instability strip , and should be common also among cv / zz ceti hybrids , so the observed change in pulsation amplitude of sdss@xmath01514 is not surprising .",
    "had this object been observed solely on the 28th it would probably have been declared a non - pulsator and dropped for further investigation .",
    "other seemingly non - pulsators may only temporarily be in a low amplitude state due to variation in accretion or a position near either edge of the instability strip , thus it is important to get good signal - to - noise ratios in the observations .    from the performed observations and the analysis that followed we conclude that sdss 1339 show clear signs of harbouring a non - radially pulsating wd , consistent with observations by @xcite , and that sdss 1514 shows strong indications of being a pulsator .",
    "many more cv / zz ceti hybrids are undoubtedly out there .",
    "in fact , one might speculate that the mass - transfer on to the wd primary can be an excitation mechanism which channels energy into pulsations , thus there could be an increased probability of non - radial pulsations in accreting wds compared to isolated wds . possibly the @xmath1 colour interval in fig .  6 , where several of the pulsators reside , may be an indication of the pulsation strip for this type of accreting wd .",
    "future observations will add to this currently small sample and hopefully reveal more explicitly if this colour interval is a good marker .",
    "we would like to thank hans kjeldsen for all the help in preparing both the remote observations from moltai and the observing proposal for the follow - up observations , and patrick a.  woudt for clever selection of new cv / zz ceti candidates that grew from aspirants into ( more or less ) confirmed hybrids during the research course at moltai . in addition , credit goes to all students and assistants who helped out during the observations , and to paula szkody who deserves recognition for providing support and valuable information subsequent to the observations .",
    "the data presented here have been taken using alfosc , which is owned by the instituto de astrofisica de andalucia ( iaa ) and operated at the nordic optical telescope under agreement between iaa and the nbifafg of the astronomical observatory of copenhagen .",
