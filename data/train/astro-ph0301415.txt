    "nova velorum 1999 ( v382 vel ) was discovered in outburst by p. williams , and independently by c. gilmore , on 1999 may 20.6 ut @xcite . it reached a maximum visual magnitude of @xmath5 @xcite after a few days of rise , making it among the brightest novae of the 20th century .",
    "its decline showed @xmath6 days and @xmath7 days @xcite marking it as a `` fast '' nova in the nomenclature introduced by @xcite ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the times after maximum for declines of two and three magnitudes , respectively ) . @xcite",
    "have determined a preoutburst mean v magnitude of 16.@xmath106 and a mean b - v of 0.@xmath1014 ; a pre - outburst b magnitude of 16.4 was reported @xcite .",
    "early optical spectroscopic observations displayed iron emission associated with the optically thick phase of a relatively massive ejection , although he i emission was reported relatively early ( 2 june , hidayat et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the first optical spectra , within two days of the first report , showed p cyg absorption components on the balmer lines @xcite .",
    "the report of very early [ o iii ] emission was later corrected , identifying the emission as fe ii .",
    "infrared observations @xcite detected the [ ne ii ] 12.8@xmath11 emission line characteristic of the `` neon nova '' group and subsequently v382 vel has been recognized as an onemg nova .",
    "v382 vel displayed comparable optical phenomenology to the well studied the onemg nova v1974 cygni ( _ e.g. _ shore et al . 1993 , 1994 ; shore 2002 ) and , as we will show here , its ultraviolet spectrum developed along similar lines .",
    "we are therefore able to make some interesting comparisons despite being unable to follow v382 vel with the dedicated instrumentation used in our earlier investigations . in this paper",
    ", we will show that much of what we have learned about the physics of the early nova outburst from the detailed study of a single onemg nova , v1974 cyg , is robust : the resemblance between these outbursts is striking and an important observational constraint on any model for the nova phenomenon .",
    "optical observations have been described by @xcite .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) observations reported here were obtained under a director s discretionary target of opportunity program ( go 8540 ) with the _ space telescope imaging spectrograph _ ( stis ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) in three epochs using the e140 m and e230 m gratings .",
    "additional spectra were obtained with the _ far ultraviolet spectrographic explorer _ ( fuse ) satellite on a galactic nova target of opportunity program at three epochs during 2000 using the large aperture in both the sic and lif channels .",
    "these observations were not accompanied by stis spectra and were well into the optically thin stage .",
    "the last spectrum contains significant atmospheric emission and has not been used in this study .",
    "the log of observations is given in table 1 .",
    "all spectra have been reduced using standard procedures for both stis and fuse and with software we have previously developed to analyze uv spectra of novae . for consistency ,",
    "we have attempted to duplicate previous analyses . since the fuse spectra were taken with the large science aperture , some shifting was required for wavelength assignments : the stis and fuse spectra were cross correlated in wavelength using the n i multiplet at 1199 .",
    "the individual stis spectra were registered using several interstellar absorption features , in particular the c ii 1334 , al ii 1671 , and mg ii 2800  doublets .",
    "the largest wavelength shift seen in the stis data is 18 km s@xmath12 , while the fuse spectra were displaced by + 40 km s@xmath12 from the stis data . after correction ,",
    "the individual line profiles were compared in velocity using the @xcite and nist atomic spectra database ( asd ) .. ]",
    "the gallery of merged binned ( 1  resolution ) spectra is shown in figs . 1 , 2 , and 3 , and",
    "the high resolution data are displayed for the 1200 - 1720  region in figs .",
    "4 , 5 , and 6 .",
    "both galleries are uncorrected for extinction .",
    "the may 31 ( o5jv01 ) observation occurred during the completely opaque phase of the `` iron curtain '' . from this stage , based on our previous experience with v1974 cyg and related onemg novae , we attempted to predict exposure times on the basis of the rate of development . the expansion velocity inferred from the width of the 1700pseudo - emission feature was approximately 4000 km s@xmath12 and , based on the the optical light curve",
    ", this nova appeared to be developing about 30% faster .",
    "subsequent observations confirmed this behavior : it was always possible to find an identical phase for each spectrum to that of v1974 cyg by scaling the time after optical maximum . from this point alone",
    "it is clear that the ejecta of the two novae were similar in dynamics and mass distribution that scaled with the energy of the outburst .",
    "the second set of observations , june 22 ( o5jv02 ) , displayed strong p cygni absorption troughs on many of the usually occurring strong resonance line profiles , as shown in fig .",
    "this stage is characteristic of onemg novae but not for classical novae of the co type .",
    "we should add that two recurrent novae , u sco during the 1979 outburst , and lmc 1990 # 2 , also displayed strong p cyg profiles on ultraviolet resonance lines of si iv and c iv in iue spectra .",
    "we will return to this point below in our discussion of nova lmc 2000 .",
    "the strongest absorption was found for si iv 1400 , which displayed a terminal velocity of -5200 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this radial velocity is substantially larger than any obtained from the optical line profiles reported by @xcite for which the velocities are in closer agreement with those measured on emission lines observed during the august 29 observations ( see below , sect .",
    "in particular , h@xmath13 on 31 may showed a weak p cyg absorption at -2500 km s@xmath12 , and low intensity red wing emission extending to -4000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this weak absorption had disappeared by 25 june , as had the extended wings on both sides of the line , being replaced by a nearly symmetric profile with fwzi of 4000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the al ii 2669  and n iv 1486  lines at this later epoch , obtained from our stis spectrum , showed a nearly identical profile .",
    "there was still , however , significant overlying line absorption that likely altered some of the emission line characteristics .",
    "in particular , the he ii 1640  emission is flanked by numerous low ionization absorption features and also the wing of the emerging o iii ] 1667  line . the mg ii profile shows a weak absorption feature at this stage extending about -4000 km s@xmath12 with a deepest absorption at about -2500 km s@xmath12 . the mg ii profile at the `` matching epoch '' of v1974 cyg ( see below ) , the spectrum lwp22786 ( see shore et al .",
    "1993 ) , displays a trough with deepest absorption at about -3000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "none of the stis spectra were taken early enough to reveal the strong p cyg phase of this resonance doublet .",
    "the p cyg profiles also provide a clue to the origin of the photometric and spectroscopic scaling between v382 vel and v1974 cyg .",
    "the ratio of the maximum expansion velocity , derived from the p cyg profiles was about 1.3 at the same epoch .",
    "it appears the luminosities of the central stars and the ejecta masses are about the same and that the scaling results from simply from the relative rate of decrease of the ejecta column density .",
    "the strength of the p cyg absorption trough and the saturation of the profile , especially for the si iv 1400  lines , argues for a large covering fraction at this stage of expansion for the optically thick material .",
    "as we will describe below , the later ( nebular ) stages display line profiles are more consistent with an axisymmetric than spherical geometry for the ejecta .",
    "therefore , as we found with v1974 cyg and other onemg novae , the early optically thick stages reveal a different ejecta geometry than the slower moving material observed during the nebular stage .",
    "the last observation with stis occurred on august 29 . by this time , the nova was in the nebular stage .",
    "strong emission dominated the 1200 - 2000  region , especially the resonance lines .",
    "notably , [ ne iv ] 1602  was approximately half the intensity of he ii 1640  and displayed a nearly identical profile , but [ ne v ] 1575  was not observed .",
    "high ionization species included n v 1240 , si iv + o iv 1400 and c iv 1550 , but there is no trace of o v 1375 .",
    "the n iv 1486  line was strong but there is no visible emission at n iv ] 1718 .",
    "resonance intercombination lines were strong , o iii ] 1667  and si iii ] 1895  and c iii ] 1909  being examples .",
    "several comparatively low ionization species were still present , including o i 1300 , c ii 1335 , n ii 2145 , and mg ii 2800 .",
    "the fwhm for all these lines was about 4000 km s@xmath12 , and the profiles were nearly identical ( see discussion below ) .",
    "using @xmath8 = 6 days and @xmath9 = 10 days , @xcite derive @xmath14 mag , which translates to @xmath15l@xmath16 , and a distance of about 2 kpc .",
    "the first stis observation occurred within one week of maximum visual brightness , at a time corresponding approximately to @xmath8 .",
    "the second and third stis observations were obtained long after visual maximum , by which time the flux maximum had clearly shifted into the ultraviolet .",
    "they permit an independent determination of the energetics of the outburst .",
    "the spectrum obtained on may 21 most closely resembles the iue spectrum swp44156 of v1974 cyg 1974 at about 20 days after optical maximum , the uncorrected ratio being a factor of 5 ( fig . 8) virtually independent of wavelength .",
    "the close correspondence of the spectra and the nearly independent flux ratio suggests the reddening for the two novae is similar and we will subsequently adopt e(b - v)=0.2 for v382 vel in the analysis to follow . only mg ii 2800  was observed in emission during the first stis spectrum .",
    "its velocity width is consistent with that observed at h@xmath13 . for a constant ( positive ) velocity gradient",
    ", the mg ii velocity indicates the line profile was formed from slower moving gas situated deeper in the ejecta than the region from which the resonance absorption trough , on the later - observed p cyg lines , form . in support of this interpretation",
    ", we note that in the may 21 spectrum , we detect a weak p cyg absorption feature at about -3000 km s@xmath12 , consistent with the reported blueward balmer line absorption velocities from the eso spectra @xcite .    for the june 21 observation ,",
    "the integrated flux was 6.98@xmath17 erg cm@xmath12s@xmath12 from 1170 - 3070 , uncorrected for extinction .",
    "the comparison is shown in fig . 9 with v1974 cyg ( swp 44378 , taken about 50 days past optical maximum ) . again , the flux ratio between the spectra is a factor of 5 in the region shortward of 1700 , uncorrected for extinction . for august 29 ,",
    "the flux in this spectral range was 1.05@xmath19 erg cm@xmath12s@xmath12 . at this stage , an approximate match is provided to v1974 cyg with spectrum swp 44378 taken 196 days after optical maximum .",
    "there are , however , significant differences that are clearly not the result of extinction .",
    "v382 vel continued to display a strong o i @xmath201302 emission even into the nebular phase and c iv @xmath201550 was also stronger relative to the nitrogen lines .",
    "al iii @xmath201860 remained stronger , and while the si iii]/c iii ] ratio is about the same as v1974 cyg , the lines display considerably more knotted structure .",
    "this may be due , in part , to the resolution of the iue low dispersion data but that can not explain all the differences ( see fig . 9 ) .",
    "the interstellar ly@xmath13 profile provides additional information on the possible reddening , yielding a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath21@xmath22 . for the august 29 spectrum , displayed in fig .",
    "10a , we assumed a gaussian profile for the ejecta emission with a fwhm of @xmath231500 km s@xmath12 , scaled to the blue wing of the observed emission . at this epoch",
    ", there should have been no p cyg absorption trough .",
    "the red wing of ly@xmath13 is blended with the n v profile producing the obvious discrepancy but we can not obtain an unblended , unabsorbed n v profile with which to precisely model the interstellar absorption .",
    "therefore , we concentrate on the blue wing of ly@xmath13 .",
    "it is clear the neutral hydrogen column density is high , this is supported by the strong h@xmath24 absorption seen in the fuse spectra ( see discussion , below ) and the strength of the interstellar lines ( table 5 ) . scaling e(b - v )",
    "= n@xmath25@xmath22 ( savage & mathis 1979 ) yields e(b - v ) @xmath26 .",
    "the first observations of v382 vel ( o5jv01 ) provide superb high quality interstellar line profiles from a wide range of absorbers .",
    "these include the co ( 2 - 1 ) overtone transitions and , in the fuse spectra , many h@xmath24 lines .",
    "while a complete analysis of these data is beyond the scope of the present paper , a study is in preparation , we note here a kinematic constraint on the distance to this nova .",
    "an important feature of these spectra is that the vela region is especially well observed in high resolution with both h i and @xmath27co ( burton 1985 ; dame et al .",
    "1987 , 1999 ) .",
    "the galactic rotation curve determined by brand & blitz ( 1993 ) and standard stars observed in this direction yield a mean @xmath28 km s@xmath12 .",
    "there is , however , a particularly interesting feature of the @xmath27co maps , a spur at large positive lsr velocity , + 20 km s@xmath12 , due to the carina arm that is also present in the stronger interstellar lines in v382 vel , requiring a lower limit on the distance of about 2 kpc .",
    "sample profiles are displayed in fig .",
    "10b .    assuming e(b - v)=0.2 , the measured continuum fluxes for the three stis observations are 3.67@xmath29 ( may 31 ) , 3.02@xmath29 ( june 21 ) , and 4.56@xmath19 erg s@xmath12 @xmath22 ( august 29 ) from 1170 - 3100 . at the time of the first observation , the optical flux , based on published ubv photometry , was 5@xmath19 erg s@xmath12 @xmath22 .",
    "even the first stis observation shows that the uv corresponded to most of the emitted flux .",
    "this yields a total luminosity in the observed band of @xmath30l@xmath16 for a distance of at least 2 kpc .",
    "if the distance is increased to 2.5 kpc , this luminosity becomes nearly identical with v1974 cyg , about 8@xmath31l@xmath16 , about the eddington luminosity of a 1.4 m@xmath16 white dwarf ( wd ) @xcite . in their study , della valle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) assumed virtually no reddening . for e(b - v)=0",
    ", we find integrated fluxes of 9.57@xmath19 , 6.92@xmath19 , and 1.05@xmath19 erg s@xmath12 @xmath22 , in the respective stis spectra , that are incompatible with the distance and spectral comparison with v1974 cyg .",
    "the flux ratios between the short wavelength spectra of the two novae ( see fig . 9 ) , assuming at least as great an extinction for v382 vel as v1974 cyg , gives a distance of 2 kpc assuming a 3.1 kpc distance for v1974 cyg ( see paresce et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "we can place independent constraints on the reddening using the quiescent luminosity .",
    "this comes from the pre - outburst observations using the parameters we have derived .",
    "post - outburst ghrs spectra of v1974 cyg revealed a white dwarf with @xmath32k after 3 years . while we do not know if an accretion disk was established by that time , it is likely one was present for v382 vel before outburst . taking v = 16.6 and assuming a distance of 2 kpc , the visible colors alone give @xmath33l@xmath16 .",
    "for an accretion disk with a @xmath34 spectral energy distribution , this becomes @xmath35l@xmath16 longward of 1200 .",
    "the luminosity is not unusual for novae entering the later stages of outburst , and is higher than the last ghrs spectrum we obtained for v1974 cyg .",
    "we summarize our distance determinations as follows . from the maximum magnitude - rate of decline ( mmrd )",
    "relation , della valle et al .",
    "( 2002 ) obtain a distance of 2 kpc . based on comparisons with v1974 cyg and nova lmc 2000 ( see below ) , we obtain the range 2 to 3 kpc .",
    "interstellar lines constrain the nova to be at least at the distance of the carina arm , so @xmath36 kpc . the preoutburst luminosity yields 2 kpc while @xmath37 gives 2.5 kpc for a chandrasekhar mass white dwarf .      the first emission lines to appear were the strongest permitted and intercombination transitions , o i 1302 , n ii ] 2145 , al ii 2675 , and mg ii 2800 .",
    "these showed identical profiles to the optical transitions .",
    "as described by @xcite and @xcite for v1974 cyg , the optical lines suffer less absorption within the ejecta and deeper layers are observed first at longer wavelengths .",
    "the consistency of the structure over time indicates that the observed emission knots must have formed early in the outburst  most likely at the time of ejection .",
    "balmer line profiles obtained on 25 june show strongly asymmetric structure , with a well defined peak at + 800 km s@xmath12 and an uncorrected h@xmath13/h@xmath38 ratio of about 6.8 @xcite . assuming case a recombination for the highest velocity  and presumably most transparent  portions of the line profile , this corresponds to e(b - v)@xmath230.2 .",
    "this is consistent with our other determinations .",
    "several distinct knots appear on all three principal balmer profiles , at + 200 , + 400 and + 800 km s@xmath12 with a weak extended feature at approximately rest ( observer s frame ) .",
    "no corresponding knots are seen on the blueshifted side of the profile .",
    "broad low intensity wings appear on all three profiles , the broadest is h@xmath39 extending to hwzi of 4000 km s@xmath12 while the other two lines show only around 200 km s@xmath12 ( fig .",
    "a curious feature of the balmer line profile development is the change in symmetry between the two epochs , separated by only about 30 days .",
    "the spectra in the first observation are almost identical to the low ionization inter - system lines observed in the june 21 spectrum . for instance , al ii @xmath202675 with stronger emission on the blueshifted side of the profile , while the later spectra do not resemble any of the uv profiles .",
    "later spectra are nearly symmetric .",
    "we note that a comparison of these low ionization profiles with the reported detection of li i 6708  @xcite suggests that the latter is likely some other low ionization emission centered at around 6705 .",
    "given the nitrogen enhancement seen in this nova , a likely candidate is the doublet n i ( @xmath40p@xmath41 - @xmath40d ) 6704.84 , 6706.11 .",
    "the far ultraviolet emission spectrum was sparse .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "12 the region of ly@xmath38 and the o vi 1031 , 1036  doublet .",
    "these were the only strong emission lines detected in the fuse spectra , taken within 1.5 years of outburst .",
    "the o vi doublet had a profile that was very similar to the optically thin c iv 1550  doublet which , as we found for v1974 cyg , is consistent with the combined optically thin profiles of the doublet components whose intrinsic form is similar to the singlets seen in the stis spectra ( this is also seen in the stis profile of the o iii ] 1667  multiplet ) .",
    "the o vi doublet showed strong decrease between the 2000 february and 2000 july spectra , dropping from 9.3@xmath42 erg s@xmath12@xmath22 to 2.0@xmath43 erg s@xmath12@xmath22 ( a09303/4 ) .",
    "both these fluxes are uncorrected for extinction but have been corrected for line absorption .",
    "the fwhm remained about 1000 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the observed decline is completely consistent with the expected @xmath44 power law for the emission ( a factor of about 3.9 ) from a freely expanding shell .",
    "no lyman series emission lines were seen in either fuse observation ; recall that ly@xmath13 showed a strong p cyg profile in 1999 june but this emission was absent in the 1999 august observation .",
    "the line profiles are virtually identical for all components of even the blended multiplets by the third stis observation , adding weight to the assertion that the ejecta were optically thin ( nebular ) by this stage .",
    "we compare the profiles of he ii @xmath201640 and [ ne iv ] @xmath201602 in fig . 13 .",
    "notice that the near identity of the profiles also argues for chemical homogenization of the ejecta during the explosion .",
    "there are no indications of the deviations we found for v1974 cyg among the individual knots and these knots in the uv line profiles can also be identified between wavelength regions and at different epochs .",
    "we remark , however , that these are _ not _ spatially resolved and the integrated large aperture spectra for v1974 cyg also did not reveal large deviations .",
    "for example , the balmer emission lines were more asymmetric in v382 vel within the first 3 weeks after outburst than the uv lines observed later with stis .",
    "they quickly transformed , however , to the same emission structure ( by june 2 ) that was observed almost 3 months later in the uv and on other optical lines .",
    "the knot at + 850 km s@xmath12 is particularly strong in both the balmer and uv lines until 25 june .",
    "this is not unexpected , since the ejecta expand hypersonically and individual knots had not yet recombined by the third stis observation .",
    "the later stis profiles are more symmetric than those seen in the first observations in the optical and with stis .    in an attempt to determine more information about the structure we performed a monte carlo simulation as described in @xcite .",
    "two geometries were assumed : a spherical shell , and a thin ring .",
    "for each , a linear velocity law was assumed and the profile was rebinned in the observer s frame .",
    "the maximum velocity was fixed at 5200 km s@xmath12 using the p cyg profiles on the uv resonance lines whose terminal velocities _ always _ exceeded those of the optical balmer lines and the later emission line profiles .",
    "figure 14 shows the comparison of a sample model profile with n iv ] 1486  and he ii @xmath201640 .",
    "both are assumed to be an optically thin recombination transitions .",
    "the model profile can also be compared with other lines in fig .",
    "the line is mainly formed from comparatively low velocity gas so we explored a range of maximum velocities for the model . the good agreement was found for a spherical geometry with @xmath45 and the density varied as @xmath46 for a constant shell mass . for a ring ,",
    "almost the same profile is obtained for @xmath47 for an inclination of 25@xmath48 .",
    "there is a near degeneracy between the inclination and thickness for a ring , but the relative weakness of the extended wings on the ring profile suggest that the spherical case more closely matches the data . however , we venture the suggestion that v382 vel may , when spatially resolved , contain an elliptical ring with a transverse expansion rate of 0.2 arcsec yr@xmath12 for a distance of 2.3 kpc .",
    "our model is derived _ for this optically thin stage_. there must be additional , rapidly expanding matter  as we found for v1974 cyg  in a more spherical distribution to account for the broad shallow wings observed on all emission line profiles in the earlier spectra .",
    "a range of inclinations can be estimated using the observed outburst amplitude and the range in the determined distance .",
    "the absolute quiescent magnitude , uncorrected for inclination , for very fast novae is 3.76 . at distances between 2 and 3 kpc ,",
    "the inclination range required to produce the observed , apparent quiescent magnitude lies between 45 and 67 degrees assuming an e(b - v ) = 0.25 .",
    "this differs from the value obtained by line profile analysis so imaging the spatially resolved ejecta should decide this issue .    as seen from fig .",
    "14 , the fit seems to be quite good but since the models `` knots '' are randomly generated , this comparison suggests that there is nothing particularly informative in the distribution of the knots , that they are not related directly to the large scale structure of the ejecta .",
    "rather , we are likely seeing the frozen remnants of an instability that produced them early in the outburst .",
    "a wind - like velocity law , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the stellar radius and @xmath38 is a constant , fails to reproduce the line profile , supporting the contention that the ejecta are freely expanding and not a wind , at least at the later stages .",
    "this does not rule out possible wind - ejecta interactions as a source for hard x - ray emission observed early in the outburst ( mukai & ishida 2001 , orio et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the bulk of the line emission comes from the innermost portion of the ejecta .",
    "this is also true for the optical line profiles , which in general sample the denser parts of the ejecta at an earlier time than the uv ( see e.g. hayward et al .",
    "while a detailed model is beyond the scope of this paper , we note that the resemblance of the uv lines in the third stis spectrum with the first optical data suggests they are formed in the same part of the ejecta and could be used for detailed modeling .",
    "it is interesting also to note the weak dependence of profile on ionization state .",
    "the ne iv ] 1602  line may have a contribution from a more spherical distribution ( see @xcite for discussion ) , although the peaks in the line core are indicative of a mainly an axisymmetric geometry , while he ii 1640  and n iv ] 1486  wings are narrower and likely formed in a predominantly ring - like structure .",
    "any further discussion of these kinematic profiles would , however , be overinterpretation .",
    "it suffices that the basic shell appears to be comparatively thick and extended and , as we will show in the next section , agrees with the results of detailed photoionization models .",
    "the third stis spectrum provides the strongest evidence for homogeneity of the ejecta .",
    "the ne iv ] 1602  and he ii 1640lines show identical profiles , with matches for each knot .",
    "this contrasts with our ghrs results for v1974 cyg @xcite where high spatial resolution small aperture spectra show marked contrasts between these two lines and also with c iv 1550 .",
    "closer agreement was found for that nova between line profiles earlier in the outburst at a time similar to those reported here , suggesting that we were not yet completely viewing the ejecta .",
    "the _ cloudy _  94.00 photoionization code ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) was used to model the observed emission line fluxes for the august 29 observation given in table 2 .",
    "we concentrate on this set of spectra since by this stage the ejecta were sufficiently optically thin , as indicated by the near identity of the line profiles on all species . _ cloudy _  simultaneously solves the equations of thermal and statistical equilibrium for a model emission nebula .",
    "its output , the predicted flux of @xmath51 10@xmath40 emission lines , is compared against the observations to determine the physical conditions in the shell . _",
    "cloudy _  has been used to model numerous novae ( see schwarz et al .",
    "1997 , 2001 ; vanlandingham et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 , 1999 ) .",
    "the outer radius of the model shell is constructed using the observed maximum expansion velocity and the time since outburst . from the early p cygni terminal velocities , we use 5200 km s@xmath12 and and assume a linear velocity flow to set the outer dimension of the shell .",
    "the inner radius was determined from the estimated shell thickness of 0.5 .",
    "the ejecta are assumed to be spherically symmetric .",
    "the density of the shell is set by a hydrogen density parameter which has a power law density profile with an exponent of -3 .",
    "this provides a constant mass per unit volume throughout the model shell , which is a reasonable assumption . _ cloudy _  also allows a filling factor of less than one .",
    "the filling factor sets the ratio of the filled to vacuum volumes in the ejecta .",
    "it acts by modifying the volume emissivity and the optical depth scale of the ejecta .",
    "the elemental abundances are set relative to hydrogen and we began initially with v1974 cyg abundance solution ( vanlandingham et al . in prep ) . a hot ( few 10@xmath52 k ) non - lte planetary nebula nuclei spectral energy distribution @xcite with a high luminosity ( @xmath51 10@xmath53 erg s@xmath12 ) is used as the input source .",
    "initial attempts to reproduce the observed line flux did a reasonable job fitting the majority of the lines but failed with the highest ionized species . the high density and",
    "the low luminosity of the model produced an ionization bounded shell with a hydrogen recombination radius slightly larger than the inner radius . as a result , the high ionization zones in the model shell were small and did not produce the required amount of flux . in order to include these other lines we added an additional , less dense component to the previous model .",
    "the lower density means the ionizing photons penetrate further into the model shell , resulting in a hotter and more ionized shell .",
    "the second component has exactly the same parameters as the denser component except for the hydrogen density and filling factor which was allowed to vary independently .",
    "table 3 gives the comparison between the observations and the _ cloudy _",
    "predictions for the two models .",
    "three of the lines from table 2 may be blends based on the _ cloudy _  predicted fluxes from lines of similar wavelengths .",
    "these lines are noted as `` blend '' in table 3 and all of the _ cloudy _",
    "lines within a few angstroms are summed and their combined flux is compared with the observation .",
    "the fluxes are presented relative to the ( 1640 ) line since we lack any uncontaminated hydrogen lines in the spectrum .",
    "the observed lines were dereddened with e(@xmath54 ) = 0.2 .",
    "we determined a goodness of fit from the @xmath55 of the model :    @xmath56    where @xmath57 is the observed line ratio and @xmath58 is the error associated with the observed line ratio ( @xmath51 25% ) .",
    "the total @xmath55 of the combined models is @xmath51 17 with the largest contribution coming from the line which is blended with the ly@xmath13 .",
    "the best fit model parameters are given in table 4 .",
    "there are 13 free parameters in the two _ cloudy _  models and thus with 16 line ratios to model there are 3 degrees of freedom .",
    "the metal abundances are scaled to he so if he / h@xmath591 , the metallicity is automatically elevated .",
    "the derived ejected mass of the models is on the high end of the values typically found for novae , @xmath60 5@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath61 , assuming a spherical covering factor of one .",
    "the covering factor is the fraction of 4@xmath62 str covered by the model shell and it scales with the _ cloudy _  line luminosities .",
    "note , a covering factor less than unity does nt affect the model wd luminosity since the covering factor only scales the line luminosities associated with the model shell .",
    "the derived abundances are not as extreme for v382 vel as those we have determined for `` fast '' novae , especially the galactic novae v693 cra and v838 her , and nova lmc 1990 # 1 .",
    "helium , carbon , and silicon are consistent with solar abundances ( he = 1.0 , c = 0.6@xmath40.3 , si = 0.5@xmath40.3 ) , while nitrogen , oxygen , neon , magnesium , and aluminum are enhanced ( n = 17@xmath44 , o = 3.4@xmath40.3 , ne = 17@xmath43 , mg = 2.6@xmath40.1 , al = 21@xmath42 ) . in general , the nitrogen , neon , and aluminum enhancements are lower than either v693 cra or nova lmc 1990 # 1 . a more detailed comparison with other onemg novae , including a re - analysis of v1974 cyg data , will be presented in a future paper .",
    "an independent estimate of the distance can be obtained using the the observed flux and the predicted luminosity from the combined models .",
    "the observed flux was dereddened assuming an e(@xmath54 ) = 0.2 and the model luminosities were calculated with a covering factor of unity .",
    "the distance obtained using this method , 2.8 @xmath63 kpc where @xmath64 is the model covering factor , is in agreement with our previous determination of @xmath51 2.5 kpc .",
    "if we use 2.5 kpc as the true distance the covering factor of the combined models must be 0.8 which drives the ejected mass down to 4@xmath010@xmath1 m@xmath61 .",
    "the mass derived by @xcite is @xmath65m@xmath16 from the data on 2000 oct . 2 for an assumed distance of 1.7 kpc .",
    "increasing this to 2.3 kpc increases the estimated mass to @xmath66m@xmath16 , still nearly a factor of 10 below the one we derive based on the uv spectra .",
    "however , since this nova suffered an extended `` iron curtain '' phase in the uv , the minimum mass must have been significantly higher than that estimated by della valle et al .",
    "( see shore 2002 ) .",
    "nova lmc 2000 provides a comparison with v382 vel , even more so than v1974 cyg .",
    "it too was an onemg nova , but being situated in the lmc provides absolute information on distance against which the galactic novae can be scaled .",
    "having observed this nova in two nearly identical stages to those seen in v382 vel , we here make some brief remarks about what can be learned from the comparative developments ( a more detailed paper on nova lmc 2000 is in preparation ) .",
    "nova lmc 2000 was discovered by liller on 2000 july 12.4 ut @xcite .",
    "archival images @xcite show the outburst was not detected on june 29.38 but the nova was visible a very short time later , june 29.65 .",
    "its maximum measured visual magnitude was 11.2 .",
    "optical spectra taken within two days showed emission lines of neutral and singly ionized species , especially the na i d lines , and p cygni profiles with a maximum expansion velocity of -1900 km s@xmath12 @xcite .",
    "our stis observations employed the same settings as those we used for v382 vel and occurred on 2000 august 19.7 ut and august 20.9 ut @xcite .",
    "weak iron - peak absorption may still be present , especially from 1550 to 1565 .",
    "the spectrum strongly resembled the august 29 v382 vel spectrum but with much stronger ly@xmath13 and si iii ] 1895  and c iii ] 1910  emission , with si iii]/c iii ] about 2 .",
    "strong c iv p - cyg absorption was seen with a terminal velocity of 2000 km s@xmath12 , similar to the fwhm velocity for the emission lines .",
    "the strongest emission lines were c iii 1076 , n v 1240 , n iii / o iii 1267 , o",
    "i 1304 , c ii 1334 , si iv / o iv ] 1400 , c iv 1550 , he ii 1640 , o iii ] 1667 , n iii ] 1750 , si ii 1816 , al iii 1860 , si iii ] 1895 , c iii ] 1910 , n ii ] 2145 , c ii 2321 , al ii 2672 , and mg ii 2800 . unlike v382 vel at this stage",
    ", there were no n iv ] 1486  or 1718  lines .",
    "the ly@xmath13 line remained strong and asymmetric .",
    "a comparison of the v382 vel and nova lmc 2000 ly@xmath13 profiles is shown in fig . 15 .",
    "notice that the shift of the nova relative to the foreground galactic contribution is responsible for the stronger blueshifted emission for the lmc nova and shows that the probable reason for the lack of recognition of ly@xmath13 p cyg profiles in galactic novae is due to interstellar absorption .",
    "this is displayed at higher resolution in the top panel of fig .",
    "the first stis spectrum was obtained at a later stage of the outburst than for v382 vel .",
    "the metallic absorption lines had already largely disappeared , leaving strong p cyg profiles on the uv resonance lines .",
    "it is important to note that this supports the conclusion drawn from galactic systems that onemg novae systematically pass through this stage in the ultraviolet .",
    "the emission line profiles in the second stis spectrum , even at this relatively early stage in the outburst , showed similar fine structure to those at the same stage in v382 vel and v1974 cyg . the integrated flux from 1150 to 3120  was @xmath67 erg @xmath22 s@xmath12 , which corresponds to @xmath68 erg @xmath22 s@xmath12 corrected for a field lmc reddening law with e(b - v ) = 0.2 . adopting a distance of 52 kpc",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath69l@xmath16 in the uv range _ only _ , since at this epoch most of the flux was being emitted in the ultraviolet . in view of the similarity of the spectra",
    ", these data yield a distance for v382 vel of 3 kpc assuming its reddening is e(b - v ) = 0.2 , which is probably an upper limit for the distance of v382 vel .",
    "the analysis of v382 vel along with two other onemg novae , v1974 cyg and nova lmc 2000 , reveals a remarkable consistency in outburst characteristics among novae of this type .",
    "although there is a range of masses and abundances , the energetics and spectral development closely follow each other .",
    "we derive a range for e(b - v ) of 0.2 to 0.3 , with the most likely value being in the lower end of the range based on a number of independent determinations , including the comparison with the other two well observed onemg novae .",
    "the maximum expansion velocity , of @xmath70 km s@xmath12 , exceeds most novae of this class ( except v838 her @xcite and lmc 1990 no .",
    "1 ) and is consistent with the `` fast '' classification .",
    "the derived mass of 4 - 5 @xmath0 10@xmath1 m@xmath2 based on our analysis is at the upper end of the range determined for fast onemg novae .",
    "this mass estimate is , however , dependent on the ejecta filling factor which is difficult to precisely determine .",
    "abundance enhancements relative to solar values are found for n , ne , mg , and al , while he , c , and si are approximately solar abundance . in general",
    ", the enhancements are lower than previously determined values for most onemg novae .",
    "finally , although the system geometry is unknown , profile modeling suggests it is consistent with an inclined ring , with an angle of about @xmath71 , that should be resolvable within a few years if the distance is about 2 to 3 kpc .",

    "anderson , and george sonneborn for their generous help with the stis and fuse observations .",
