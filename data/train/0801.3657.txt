    "the black hole information paradox   is one of the great thought experiments in physics .",
    "three decades of effort have made it clear that it has no trivial resolution , but indeed requires a modification of some central principle of physics  @xcite , although the focus has largely shifted from a breakdown of quantum purity to a holographic nonlocality of quantum gravity  @xcite .",
    "the information paradox was largely responsible for the intense scrutiny given to the dynamical properties of black branes , which led to the discovery of gauge / gravity duality  @xcite .",
    "this duality in turn implies that information is not lost , because one can describe the formation and decay of a black hole within systems that have a well - defined dual description in an ordinary quantum framework .",
    "this argument for information preservation is rather indirect . in order to calculate the black hole s - matrix",
    ", one must translate the initial infalling state into the dual field theory , evolve forward in the field theory variables , and translate back into the outgoing state of the hawking radiation .",
    "it would be desirable to have a prescription entirely in terms of the bulk gravitational variables , since this is how the hawking radiation , and the apparent information loss , is found .",
    "indeed , the proposed answers to the question `` where does the argument for information loss break down ? '' are now as diverse as the answers to the original question `` what happens to information thrown into a black hole ? '' we may hope that the attempt to answer this new question will be as fruitful as it was for the earlier one .",
    "it is notable that some features of the black hole persist even in the weakly coupled gauge theory , where the spacetime interpretation of the bulk breaks down .",
    "the continuation of the hawking - page transition  @xcite to weak coupling has been studied extensively  @xcite .",
    "it has also been argued that vestiges of the black hole singularity  @xcite and of the information problem  @xcite survive at weak coupling . or matrix theory black holes .",
    "the weakly coupled limit of the btz black hole is also interesting , and the corresponding questions have been explored in refs .",
    "@xcite . ]    ref .",
    "@xcite considers the information problem in the form presented in ref .",
    "the low energy gravitational field theory description of ads black holes shows quasinormal behavior , the exponential decay of correlations in time  @xcite",
    ". this description should be valid at large @xmath0 and large t hooft parameter , where the curvature is small . in the dual field theory ,",
    "exponential decay is possible at infinite @xmath0 , where the thermal field theory has an infinite number of states and can absorb an arbitrary amount of information .",
    "however , at large finite @xmath0 exponential decay can only persist until the correlations are of order @xmath1 , because the black hole has only a finite number of states and so the correlator is a sum of a finite number of exponentials .",
    "reconciling this with the prediction of the low energy bulk field theory is a manifestation of the information paradox .    ref .",
    "@xcite argues that signs of the quasinormal behavior can be seen at arbitrarily weak coupling , in that perturbation theory breaks down at long times no matter how small the coupling is .",
    "we would like to extend this , resumming the perturbation theory to see the explicit form of the late - time behavior .",
    "the graphs considered in ref .",
    "@xcite have a simple iterative structure that suggests such a resummation .",
    "however , we would like to find a situation in which this resummation is systematic , in that it represents the full planar amplitude .",
    "this would provide a setting for discussing the breakdown of the large-@xmath0 approximation , which is dual to the loop expansion of the bulk theory .",
    "we identify a simple system with the desired property : a harmonic oscillator in the @xmath2 adjoint representation plus a harmonic oscillator in the @xmath2 fundamental , coupled through a trilinear interaction .",
    "in particular , it is sufficient to consider the limit of a single fundamental excitation in interaction with the adjoint oscillator .",
    "one can think of the adjoint as a heat bath coupled to the fundamental , and we study the decay of correlations of the fundamental field .",
    "this model may have a number of realizations ; one can think of it as a reduced version of a d0-brane black hole with a d@xmath3 probe , where the matrix variables are the 0 - 0 fields and the fundamentals are the 0-@xmath4 fields  @xcite .",
    "it might actually arise in some decoupling limit , although of course it would be a limit of large spacetime curvature .",
    "this simple model may also have applications outside of black hole physics , along the lines of the caldeira - leggett model  .    in sec .",
    "2 we introduce the model .",
    "it has the same graphical structure as the t hooft model of two - dimensional qcd  @xcite .",
    "unlike the t hooft model there are dynamical adjoints , but we achieve the simplified graphical structure of the t hooft model by stipulating that the adjoints have no self - interaction .",
    "we first consider zero temperature ; we derive the schwinger - dyson equation , which reduces to a two - term recursion equation with respect to frequency .",
    "the singularities consist of poles on the real axis .",
    "we also analyze the quantum mechanics canonically , leading to a closed - form solution a zero temperature .    in sec .",
    "3 we consider nonzero temperature .",
    "again , the schwinger - dyson equation reduces to an iterative equation , but with three terms rather than two .",
    "in this case we can argue that the correlator for the fundamental field must approach zero at long times ( in the planar limit ) .",
    "numerically , we show that the decay is power law for small couplings and exponential for couplings that are sufficiently large ; the power law regime is likely an artifact of our model that has no analog for the black hole .",
    "we develop briefly the approximate solutions for small coupling and small mass .",
    "we also extend the model , by the introduction of decoupled sectors and the singlet constraint , so as to obtain a hagedorn transition .    in sec .",
    "4 we discuss some implications for the information problem .",
    "the fields are a hermitian matrix @xmath5 and a complex vector @xmath6 , with conjugate momenta @xmath7 = i \\delta_{il } \\delta_{jk}\\ , \\quad [ \\phi_i , \\pi_j ] = i \\delta_{ij}\\ .\\ ] ] the hamiltonian is @xmath8 in terms of the lowering operators for the fundamental and antifundamental , @xmath9 this is ( dropping a constant ) @xmath10 we do not impose the singlet constraint for now , and so there is no hawking - page transition . in sec .  3.4 we will extend this model to include these features .",
    "there are several motivations that lead us to this model .",
    "the model of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on iteration of the basic graphical unit shown in fig .",
    "1 .    -.4 in     in our case , the basic process is just the upper half of this graph , above the dashed line : a vector emitting and reabsorbing an adjoint .",
    "the doubling of the graph in ref .",
    "@xcite plays no essential role , so our model should have similar properties .",
    "moreover , we will see that for us the iteration represents the full planar approximation , whereas in ref .",
    "@xcite it is just a partial summation , while the full planar summation would be much harder . for the purpose of systematic study of the breakdown of the @xmath11 approximation , it is useful that one can sum the full planar amplitude .",
    "in fact , a very similar model has already been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite as an approximation to the quantum mechanics of d0-branes .",
    "that model is more elaborate , in that the fields carry additional indices , and there are fermions , with supersymmetry .",
    "however , the basic graphical structure is the same ; in particular the self - interaction of the adjoints is replaced with a quadratic potential , via a mean field approximation . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the adjoints form a d0-brane black hole , and the fundamental is a string stretched from a probe d0-brane to the black hole .",
    "we will be studying the correlator in the one - fundamental sector .",
    "essentially , we are looking at waves traveling on the stretched string , particularly as they fall into the black hole .",
    "@xcite considered a similar situation . )",
    "this system  ( [ ham ] ) has no ground state , because the highest term is cubic in the fields .",
    "however , the hamiltonian commutes with the number operators @xmath12 and @xmath13 , and in each @xmath14 sector there is a ground state . defining @xmath15 the eigenstates of @xmath16 are the same as those of @xmath17 , and for sufficiently large @xmath18 and @xmath19 the ground state will be in the sector @xmath20 .",
    "we assume this henceforth .",
    "in fact , for our purposes we need study only the behavior of a single particle in the fundamental represention , in interaction with the matrix heat bath . to isolate this",
    "we will take the splitting @xmath19 for the fundamental oscillator to be large compared to all other scales , in particular the temperature , and we focus on the observable @xmath21 note that @xmath22 and @xmath23 are lorentzian , and that in the present section we are interested in temperature @xmath24 . by construction , the stabilizing term  ( [ hprime ] ) vanishes in the relevant sectors @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and so we can calculate with the original @xmath17  ( [ ham ] ) . including the phase factor in the correlator , the dependence on @xmath19 drops out in the large-@xmath19 limit .",
    "thus there are essentially two parameters at zero temperature , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 with units of @xmath29 . in terms of the analogous brane system , taking @xmath19 to be large means that the probe brane is far from the black hole .      at zero temperature , the sum of all planar contributions to the correlator  ( [ correlator ] ) is given by the schwinger - dyson equation @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 this is shown graphically in fig .",
    "( propagator with shaded rectangle ) in terms of @xmath33 and @xmath34 . ]",
    "this has the same form as in 2-d qcd  @xcite because the index structure of the interaction is the same .",
    "the integral can be carried out .",
    "because @xmath35 annihilates the vacuum , @xmath36 vanishes for @xmath37 and so @xmath38 is nonsingular in the upper half - plane . also , because the coupling @xmath28 has mass dimension @xmath39 we can assume that @xmath40 has its free behavior @xmath41 at high frequency .",
    "we can then close the contour in the upper half - plane and evaluate the residue at @xmath42 to obtain @xmath43 we omit the @xmath44 from this equation , with the understanding that the correlator is to be evaluated infinitesimally above the real axis .    in sec .",
    "2.3 we will solve this in closed form , but first let us study it using a variety of analytic and numerical approaches . to get our bearings , let us consider first the limit @xmath45 with @xmath46 fixed .",
    "( [ sde2 ] ) becomes the algebraic equation @xmath47 and so @xmath48 on the physical sheet , the square root approaches @xmath49 at long distance .",
    "the @xmath50 pole has been broadened into a branch cut of width @xmath51 .",
    "this has a simple interpretation .",
    "we are taking the harmonic oscillator frequency @xmath27 to 0 , so the matrix @xmath52 is essentially a static variable with an eigenvalue distribution given by the wigner semi - circle law .",
    "the propagator  ( [ sol1 ] ) is just the free propagator with mass @xmath53 , averaged over a semi - circle eigenvalue distribution for @xmath52 of width @xmath54 .",
    "the branch cuts in @xmath49 translate into the asymptotic power law decay @xmath55 .",
    "however , this power law decay is unrelated to the quasinormal behavior that we seek : it originates from the noncompactness of @xmath52 due to the vanishing of the potential at @xmath56 , rather than the large-@xmath0 limit .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ sde2 ] ) as a recursion relation @xmath57 gives an efficient way to calculate numerically , beginning with the asymptotic behavior  @xmath58 . in order this procedure to work",
    ", we must require that the recursion be stable at large @xmath59  otherwise , subasymptotic terms could grow to become significant .",
    "suppose that there is a solution @xmath60 , and we consider a perturbation @xmath61 . then @xmath62 the recursion is stable towards increasing @xmath49 when @xmath63 , and stable towards decreasing @xmath49 when the inequality is reversed .",
    "since @xmath64 at large @xmath59 , the recursion is stable there in the direction of increasing @xmath49 . given perfect numerical precision , we could start at very large negative @xmath49 and use the convergence to bring us very close to a solution .",
    "even if the recursion became unstable for some intermediate range , we could make the initial error as small as desired . in practice",
    ", a highly unstable recursion would lead to a numerical errors .",
    "this is an potentially an issue at small @xmath27 , where the recursion requires many steps .",
    "in fact , using the @xmath65 solution  ( [ sol1 ] ) one finds that the recursion to the right is no worse than neutrally stable in this limit .    before performing the numerics",
    ", we can anticipate that the branch cut found at @xmath65 must break up into poles . since there is no branch cut at large @xmath49 , none can appear through the recursion .",
    "however , whenever the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ rec1 ] ) vanishes , there will be a pole in @xmath38 .",
    "generically this will happen at isolated points on the real axis , because the right - hand side is purely imaginary there . the numerical integration verifies this picture : the branch cut breaks up into poles as @xmath27 is turned on , and the poles move further apart as @xmath27 is increased with @xmath66 fixed .",
    "zero temperature results for the real part of @xmath38 are shown in fig .  3 for @xmath67 , @xmath68 and in fig .",
    "4a for @xmath67 , @xmath69 .",

    "there is a temptation at small @xmath27 to approximate the recursion  ( [ rec1 ] ) by a differential equation , but this does not seem to be useful : the differential equation is less stable than the recursion relation .",
    "they agree on smooth configurations , but have different @xmath70 instabilities .      the intermediate states in fig",
    ".  2 consist of a single @xmath71 excitation plus any number of @xmath52 excitations , with the indices contracted : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the free ground state and @xmath74 is the raising operator .",
    "the states @xmath75 are orthonormal at large @xmath0 . then @xmath76 the last term has norm of order @xmath77 and so drops out in the planar limit .",
    "the noncompactness in @xmath78 suggests that this model may show quasinormal behavior at finite temperature .",
    "defining @xmath79 we have the eigenvalue condition @xmath80 this is essentially the bessel recursion relation .",
    "specifically , @xmath81 here @xmath82 would satisfy the same recursion relation , but only the solution  ( [ wavefun ] ) is normalizable . the eigenvalue condition @xmath83 determines the poles in the correlator .",
    "with this clue , we can find the closed - form solution to the schwinger - dyson equation  ( [ sde2 ] ) , @xmath84",
    "now consider the system at nonzero temperature . to study real - time thermal correlators",
    "one generally needs the doubled integration contour of the schwinger - keldysh formalism  @xcite",
    ". however , our situation simplifies .",
    "first , we are assuming that @xmath19 is large compared to the temperature , so there are no @xmath71 excitations in thermal equilibrium .",
    "second , the @xmath52 fields have no self - interaction , so the thermal ensemble is free .. ] in this case the real - time formalism reduces to replacing the @xmath52 propagator with the free thermal propagator , @xmath85 the schwinger - dyson equation is changed only by the use of this propagator , @xmath86 the time - ordered correlator @xmath87 still vanishes at @xmath37 ( because @xmath88 ) and so we can again close the contour in the upper half - plane and pick up only the poles of @xmath89 .",
    "this gives @xmath90 \\right\\}\\ , \\label{sde3}\\ ] ] or @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "although this is similar to the zero - temperature schwinger - dyson equation , the behavior of its solutions is very different . at zero temperature",
    "the singularities of @xmath38 are poles on the real axis . at nonzero temperature",
    "such poles are impossible .    to see this , note first the spectral representation , @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "the fourier transform is @xmath95 we have introduced the nonnegative spectral density @xmath96 now , suppose that there is a pole in @xmath97 at some @xmath98 .",
    "then the first term on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ sde4 ] ) has a pole at @xmath99 .",
    "this must be cancelled either by a pole in the last term with a residue of the opposite sign , or by a pole in the second term from a zero of @xmath97 at @xmath99 .",
    "the spectral representation forbids a negative residue , so the zero must exist . similarly we can conclude that there is a zero at @xmath100 .",
    "it then follows that all three terms on the lhs vanish at @xmath101 , which is a contradiction except possibly for a pole at @xmath102 ( which is indeed present in the free theory ) .",
    "the absence of poles , and so of delta - functions in @xmath103 , immediately implies that the correlator goes to zero asymptotically in time : this model has the planar behavior that we seek .",
    "if the zero temperature poles separate into branch cuts on the real axis there will be power law falloff ; if the singularities drop below the real axis onto the second sheet the decay will be exponential .",
    "we find numerically that at small nonzero temperature the poles widen into branch cuts , while at higher temperature the cuts merge and the singularities drop below the axis .",
    "we will present these results in sec .",
    "3.2 , after some further analytic discussion .",
    "the recursion relation again becomes algebraic in the limit @xmath45 , now with @xmath104 fixed , @xmath105 the solution is @xmath106 the logic is the same as at zero temperature , with the eigenvalue distribution thermally broadened .",
    "the three term recursion relation  ( [ sde4 ] ) is unstable in both directions , so its solution is less constrained than at zero temperature .",
    "we can derive some useful results from the real part @xmath107 .",
    "then @xmath108 first , if the spectral density has support in any segment of the real axis then it has support in every segment translated by a multiple of @xmath27 .",
    "thus , when the poles spread into branch cuts , each cut is accompanied by an unbounded series of additional cuts .",
    "this does not contradict the known asymptotic behavior , because the magnitude of @xmath109 goes to zero at large @xmath49 .",
    "the form of the falloff follows from the fact that coefficient of the middle term in eq .",
    "( [ real ] ) becomes large asympotically , @xmath110 .",
    "the recursion relation is then dominated by two terms , @xmath111 so the spectral density behaves asymptotically as @xmath112 .",
    "the instability of the recursion relation makes numerical calculation challenging .",
    "one approach would be to fine tune the initial condition .",
    "however , we have had more success by a different approach , solving the stable zero temperature recursion relation and then solving the coupled differential equations obtained by differentiating the recursion relation  ( [ sde4 ] ) with respect to @xmath113 at fixed @xmath114 . figs .",

    "the vertical axis is rescaled at each temperature for best visibility ( the actual area under the curve is @xmath119 at all temperatures ) , and at zero temperature @xmath49 is taken slightly above the real axis for the same reason.,title=\"fig : \" ]    at zero temperature ( a ) this is a set of delta functions , meaning poles in @xmath38 .",
    "at low temperature ( b ) the poles become short branch cuts , and additional cuts appear , shifted by multiples of @xmath27 . as the temperature",
    "is increased ( c ) the cuts lengthen and begin to merge , but there are still gaps . at higher temperatures",
    "( d ) the cuts have completely merged and @xmath115 is everywhere positive and smooth : the singularities have moved onto the second sheet . the recursion relation and its solution have a sensible infinite temperature limit ( e ) . in the infinite temperature limit",
    "the equation is symmetric under @xmath120 , and this symmetry provides a check on the numerical approach .",
    "we have verified numerically that the high - temperature solution is smooth out to @xmath121 , and the asymptotics  ( [ ttr ] ) imply that nonanalyticity can not arise at large @xmath49 if not present at smaller values .",

    "5 . two exponentials are evident .",
    "the amplitude and decay rate of the first few points matches the central peak in fig .",
    "the long - lived exponential arises from the closest pole to the real axis , which has a residue smaller by a factor of order @xmath125 .",
    "this appears to be associated with the last branch cuts to merge , and with the kink near @xmath126 in fig .",
    "4d ( examination with greater resolution verifies that the function in fig .",
    "4d is smooth at this point ) .",
    "thus , our simple model has the behavior that we seek",
    ". it would be good to have an approximate analytic treatment of the quasinormal behavior .",
    "this is difficult because the model has three energy scales , @xmath27 , @xmath114 , and @xmath113 , and the quasinormal behavior disappears if any are set to zero . , but as we have noted this is not associated with large @xmath0 . ] note that in fig .",
    "4 we have taken @xmath116 , @xmath117 , near the middle of parameter space , because the numerics are cleanest there .    we can develop an approximate solution when any of the parameters is small ; here we note a few features of two such approximations .      the ordinary perturbation theory in @xmath127 is singular here at long times  @xcite . in our model",
    ", this shows up as the fact that each additional order of perturbation theory brings additional poles in @xmath97 , even within the 1pi part .",
    "however , we can obtain an improved approximation from what we know of the solution .",
    "we expect that the pole at @xmath50 will turn into a short branch cut , and that additional branch cuts will develop translated by multiples of @xmath27 . from the structure of the recursion relation ,",
    "the spectral weight in the branch cut at @xmath128 will is of order @xmath129 .",

    "however , the discriminant for this equation vanishes at @xmath140 , beyond which the solution is purely imaginary .",
    "this determines the branch cut width @xmath141)$ ] .",
    "these results have been confirmed numerically .",
    "note that the spectral density implied by the cubic equation is more complicated than the semicircle law that might have been expected for a short cut .",
    ", so there is another branch cut not far below the real axis . ]",
    "the cuts at @xmath142 are also determined by the relations  ( [ 0pm ] ) and are smaller by @xmath143 .",
    "the further cuts are given by the two - term recursion  ( [ ttr ] ) and are down by @xmath144 as expected .",
    "one can systematically carry this small-@xmath127 approximation to higher order and no singularities arise , so we have found the quantitative small-@xmath127 behavior .",
    "the branch points imply power law decay , so there is again a contradiction with the finite-@xmath0 behavior .      at small @xmath27",
    "the recursion relation goes over naively to the differential equation @xmath145 where the prime denotes an @xmath49-derivative .",
    "we are holding @xmath146 fixed .",
    "if @xmath113 were held fixed the lhs would be of order @xmath147 and we would need to keep also a second derivative term , but the conclusions would be similar . the derivative term is a perturbation , but a singular one  @xcite : it can become large in regions of large gradient . again it is useful to study the stability near a solution @xmath148 , expanding @xmath149 : @xmath150 assuming that the solution @xmath151 is close to the algebraic solution  ( [ m0 t ] ) , one finds that the solution is stable toward increasing @xmath49 for @xmath152 and for @xmath153 , where @xmath154 are the branch points of the @xmath65 solution , and stable toward decreasing @xmath49 for @xmath155 .",
    "thus , starting from the known asymptotic behavior at large negative @xmath49 , the differential equation has a unique solution which is close to the @xmath65 solution for @xmath156 and then blows up rapidly , as @xmath157 .",
    "similarly by starting at @xmath158 and integrating in both directions one obtains a solution that is close to the @xmath65 solution for @xmath159 and blows up beyond this point .",
    "these solutions clearly do not match onto one another as a single solution to the differential equation .",
    "the point is that near the branch point @xmath160 the gradients become of order @xmath161 and we must use the original discrete form of the equation .",
    "the full solution requires matching this ` boundary layer ' solution with the smooth outer solutions that we have found .",
    "the details are an interesting direction for future work .",
    "in particular , the singularities will be closest to the real axis in the boundary layer , where the variation is the most rapid , and so this part of the solution dominates the long - time behavior .      in the model",
    "thus far , we have not imposed the singlet constraint that generally is present in quantum mechanical realizations of gauge / gravity duality . in consequence",
    ", there is no phase transition as the temperature is varied .",
    "these features can be restored without altering the earlier results , by introducing some decoupled sectors .",
    "first , to form a singlet we need an antifundamental excitation , which we can obtain from an additional decoupled oscillator",
    ". it would be more natural to excite an antifundamental excitation of the original @xmath71 oscillator , but then we would also need to include ladder graphs as in ref .",
    "@xcite ; this may be an interesting direction for future work .",
    "the thermal phase transition with large-@xmath0 oscillators has been studied in ref .",
    "@xcite and in more detail in ref .",
    ". we will review this very briefly .",
    "the singlet constraint is enforced by integrating over a wilson - polyakov line @xmath162 in the euclidean time direction . at fixed diagonal @xmath162",

    "all adjoint propagators in a graph are evaluated with the same @xmath162 , which is then integrated over .",
    "the @xmath71 propagator is unaffected because @xmath19 is large : paths that wind around the euclidean time direction do not contribute .",
    "we extend the previous model by the addition of an adjoint oscillator of frequency @xmath165 .",
    "this is decoupled from the other fields except through the singlet constraint , that is , through its coupling to @xmath162 .",
    "the phase transition occurs when  @xcite @xmath166 as @xmath167 , @xmath168 and as @xmath169 , @xmath170 , so we can adjust the transition to take place at any temperature .    at @xmath171 ,",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath172 are uniformly distributed on the unit circle , so that @xmath173 for any finite @xmath174 .",

    "the eigenvalues become nonuniform , and at @xmath176 they are concentrated around the identity",
    ". for @xmath177 we can replace @xmath162 with the identity , and the propagator  ( [ uprop ] ) reduces to its form  ( [ ktherm ] ) without the singlet constraint .",
    "we then recover the quasinormal behavior found earlier .",
    "now let us return to the information paradox , and discuss what we might learn .",
    "our model does not capture all aspects of the paradox , spacetime locality in particular : like the weakly coupled gauge theory , there is no large bulk dual and no notion of spacetime locality .",
    "at best , the model represents a bulk theory in a large curvature limit .    what the model does preserve is the large-@xmath0 structure , the existence of dissipative behavior in the planar limit that does not survive at finite @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath11 expansion in gauge / gravity duality is dual to the loop expansion in quantum gravity .",
    "it is a crucial question , how the preservation of information is manifested in this expansion .",
    "whatever form the answer takes , there should be some parallel in our model .",
    "for example , there have been many proposals over the years that evidence for information restoration can be seen in the breakdown of the gravitational loop expansion even at low orders ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent discussion along these lines .",
    "a rather different proposal is that the restoration arises from nonperturbative effects in the gravitational loop expansion , additional saddle points that were omitted in the original argument  @xcite .",
    "these two approaches would correspond respectively to an order - by - order breakdown of the @xmath11 expansion , and to the contribution of @xmath1 effects .",
    "the saddle point proposal has been analyzed critically in refs .",
    "we can paraphrase their key argument as follows . in the planar approximation , in the regime where the singularities lie below the real axis",
    ", the spectral density @xmath178 has support on the whole real axis . at finite @xmath0",
    ", this must break up into poles with a typical spacing @xmath1 .",
    "if we consider an observable corresponding to the convolution of @xmath179 with some smooth function , the effect is only of order @xmath1 , and so looks as though it might be captured by a saddle point contribution  @xcite . however , if we measure @xmath179 at a precise value of @xmath180 , the effect is of order one ( or larger ) , which can not be captured by such a saddle point .",
    "a euclidean saddle point gives a contribution to the density matrix , so with two such saddles we have @xmath181 with @xmath182 and @xmath183 normalized density matrices and @xmath184 of order @xmath185 .",
    "this implies for the correlator @xmath186 observing the order one effect requires measurements on a time scale of order @xmath187 , which suggests the possibility of a compensating @xmath0-dependence .",
    "particles , so again there is the possibility of an offsetting factor .",
    "] however , the extra saddle points do not have the necessary enhancement : we need that the total residue of the poles in @xmath188 be 1 .",
    "the dominant saddle gives a continuum with total weight @xmath189 , while the secondary saddles may give poles but with total weight @xmath1 .",
    "our discussion suggests a further problem with this idea .",
    "namely , the difference between the planar and finite-@xmath0 behavior already shows up in the basic model presented in sec .",
    "2.1 , without the singlet constraint and without the wilson line variable @xmath162 .",
    "the additional saddle discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite appears in the @xmath162-integration .",
    "we should be alert to possible artifacts of our model .",
    "in particular , the fact that we find power law decay at small @xmath28 for arbitrarily large temperatures is likely connected with the fact that the fields in our adjoint heat bath are free , so states do not mix as completely as they should .",
    "we expect that in the weakly coupled gauge theory ( at temperatures above the hawking - page transition ) there will be exponential decay .",
    "however , the power law decay is already in contradiction with the finite-@xmath0 behavior , so for our purposes we can regard this as quasinormal behavior .    because we do not have a bulk spacetime , we can not separate stringy physics from gravitational field theory .",
    "that is , we capture the gravitational loop expansion but not the @xmath190 expansion . thus we can not directly investigate proposals such as those in refs .",
    "@xcite , which relate information recovery to specifically stringy physics .",
    "our discussion has been entirely in the field theory language .",
    "the dual language would correspond to working with @xmath2 invariants such as products of @xmath191 and @xmath192 , either traced or in bilinears with @xmath35 and @xmath193 ; it would be interesting to develop this further . in this form ,",
    "finiteness of @xmath0 shows up as relations between these invariants ; for example , tr@xmath194 can be expressed in terms of lower traces for @xmath195 .",
    "one does not expect these relations to be visible in perturbation theory in @xmath11 , since for any given @xmath196 they turn on abruptly at a finite value of @xmath11 .",
    "rather , they seem to imply that the closed string bulk variable are simply not good variables for nonperturbative gravity .",
    "this reduction of the number of independent variables is the ` stringy exclusion principle ' @xcite .",
    "it has been related to the growth of the size of objects at high energy  @xcite .",
    "the information paradox also implies another reduction in the size of the hilbert space , the ` black hole complementarity principle '  @xcite .",
    "for example , in an eternal ads black hole there is an infinite number of infalling modes at the horizon ; however , only a bekenstein - hawking entropy s worth can be independent .",
    "the idea that black hole complementarity is a consequence of the stringy exclusion principle is implicit in various places ; the formulation of the information paradox in ref .",
    "@xcite makes it particularly clear .",
    "growth of string states near the horizon was discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . unlike the case studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the string blows up into a spherical d3-brane , at the horizon it grows into a randomly walking long string . in the gauge theory ,",
    "the former corresponds to the trace of a large power of a single field , while the latter suggests the more generic case of the trace of a random sequence of fields .",
    "d - branes are related to the @xmath197 growth of perturbation theory  @xcite , versus @xmath198 in field theory , and to the associated @xmath199 effects ( though they can not be the only such effects  @xcite ) .",
    "given the connection between the stringy exclusion principle and d - branes , we are led to conjecture that the breakdown of low energy effective field theory in the neighborhood of a black hole is manifested by a @xmath197 growth of perturbation theory , and by @xmath200 nonperturbative effects , as compared to @xmath201 contributions from field theory saddles .",
    "this conjecture is just based on analogy ; we do not have any specific scenario for how these large high order amplitudes appear , and for how the @xmath200 effects become order one in certain observables .",
    "lastly , we note an interesting recent paper  @xcite on the time scale for black hole information return",
    ". the arguments of this paper rest on certain assumptions about the thermalization process . it may be possible to investigate these in our model , or some extension of it .",
