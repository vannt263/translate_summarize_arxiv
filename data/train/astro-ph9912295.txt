    "two of the most fundamental outstanding questions regarding the nature of active nucleus galaxies are : ( i ) to what extent can the differences between various observed types of agn be attributed to their orientation , evolutionary history or to their intrinsic properties and ( ii ) what are the processes responsible for triggering activity in galactic nuclei .",
    "we are exploring these questions on the basis of new observations and analysis of a sample of ir - luminous seyfert galaxies , that are sufficiently close that their morphologies , environments and kinematics can be studied in great detail . in @xcite ( hereafter paper i )",
    "we have presented imaging data for a sample of seyfert galaxies with warm 25 - 60 @xmath0 m colours , selected from the original warm sample of de grijp ( 1987 , 1992 ) and for a control sample of mid - ir cold galaxies . in @xcite ( hereafter paper ii )",
    "we discussed their optical properties , resulting from aperture photometry , and their correlations with ir properties . in chatzichristou 2000c and 2000d ( hereafter papers iii and iv ) , we parametrized the radial light and colour distributions in the host galaxies .",
    "in the present paper v , we shall investigate the morphologies and close environments of our sample galaxies and will discuss the major results from papers ii - v , in the context of galactic interactions and mergers .",
    "a generally accepted unification model for agn postulates that many of their observed characteristics depend upon the orientation of the observer relative to the dusty torus axis that is surrounding the central black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "our sample is particularly suitable for testing the universality of the orientation unification scheme for seyferts .",
    "although there have been several previous studies of the morphologies and environments of optically - selected seyfert galaxies , our iras - selected seyferts provide a sample for which dust orientation dependent effects should be much less dominant .",
    "observationally and theoretically there are indications that transient encounters and accretion of small companions are responsible for triggering nuclear activity by funneling gas to the central black hole ( through bar formation for instance ) and that violent interactions would rather lead to complete destruction of the disks involved and trigger large scale star formation events ( as the ones seen in ulirgs , @xcite and references therein ) . optically selected samples of agns show interactions in only a small fraction of objects . among ir",
    "selected samples this fraction is much larger , increasing systematically with ir power ( especially when 10@xmath1 10@xmath2 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "several recent studies leave little doubt that mergers cause ir excess emission , especially in the most luminous ir galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "mergers could also be related to seyfert activity , but it remains uncertain what the ultimate fate of the infalling gas will be after the merger is completed and what are the processes that lead to ( re)activation of the central engine .    in this paper we shall give evidence for a causal connection between galactic interactions and both ir and nuclear activity , suggesting an evolutionary link between starburst dominated and agn dominated ir emission : at the earlier stages of the encounter , material is funneled inwards triggering intense star formation that produces the bulk of far - ir luminosity . at this stage",
    "the agn is not yet activated or is hidden by large amounts of dust and the object is classified as a cold galaxy . as gas becomes centrally concentrated the agn",
    "is activated , rivaling or dominating the luminosity output of the system at mid - ir wavelengths .",
    "the blr remains still hidden and the galaxy is classified as a seyfert 2 .",
    "as time goes by , material is consumed in forming stars or blown away by stellar winds ; we start seeing the blr and thus we classify the galaxy as a seyfert 1 .",
    "the occurrence of a mid - ir excess must be also related to intrinsic properties such as the dust / gas content in the progenitors and the interaction geometry , than being merely a transition period in the evolution of strongly interacting systems . in conclusion ,",
    "the distinction between warm seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies is not one of simple orientation .",
    "the latter represent an earlier evolutionary stage , with properties intermediate between the ( starburst - dominated ) cold galaxies and the warm seyfert 1s and are probably affected by ( orientation - independent ) nuclear obscuration .",
    "most previous statistical studies of seyfert environments concentrated on the galaxy density within a certain radius , somewhat arbitrarily chosen . as we shall discuss in section 6 this choice , as well as the selection of biased control samples , might have serious consequences for the results obtained . in the present work we choose an approach that emphasizes the evidence for strong interactions between the seyfert hosts and their neighbours .",
    "since our warm and cold samples are incomplete and their selection might favour dense environments , we shall instead ( i ) probe the environmental differences _ among _ our ( sub)samples ( ii ) investigate how these are related to their nuclear- and ir - activity types and ( iii ) study their morphological differences .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe our parametrization of morphologies and environments . in sections 3 - 5",
    "our results are presented and discussed in connection with the major results of papers ii - iv .",
    "the important points in each section are highlighted . in section 6",
    "we compare our results with the recent literature and combine the main conclusions of the present study ( papers ii - v ) in a coherent picture ; the implications for the seyfert unification models are also discussed .",
    "section 7 summarizes our conclusions .",
    "we classify our objects according to their interaction stage and to their morphologies . for the moment , this classification is phenomenological but as we shall show throughout this paper ( section 6 ) there is a physical basis for this classification .",
    "our interaction classification ( ic ) comprises four classes : ( i ) isolated ; ( c ) objects with companions but no signs of disruption ; ( s ) strongly interacting systems where at least one of the galaxies is obviously distorted with tidal extensions , connecting bridges , ; ( mg ) mergers which are ( i ) either double nucleus systems or ( ii ) evolved mergers , where the two nuclei can not be disentangled but the system possesses typical characteristics of a recent merger ( for instance tidal tails emanating from the main body in opposite directions ) .",
    "our morphological classification comprises also four classes : ( n ) normal morphologies that is , objects with apparently undisturbed morphologies , no obvious tidal features or bar / ring - like asymmetries ; ( b / r ) barred / ringed systems ( for brevity in some of our graphs we use the label b although they might have also rings ) ; ( t ) objects that show some tidal feature ( an obviously deformed disk , an asymmetric spiral , a one - sided tail etc . ) but do not undergo a disruptive encounter with a close - by companion ; ( bt ) simultaneous occurrence of the last two classes , which as we shall see is an interesting discriminator by itself . although the mergers ( interaction class ( mg ) ) are not part of this morphological classification , they are included in our histograms and plots of morphological classes , for comparison with the rest of the objects . we allow four types of morphologies for the isolated galaxies and systems with companions and two types for the strongly interacting systems .",
    "@xcite classified his sample of markarian seyferts in a similar fashion , but his definitions are quite different from ours .",
    "his interaction classes 2 and 3 are contained in our interaction class ( s ) while our class ( mg ) is not a distinct class in his classification but probably makes part of his interaction class 3 ( bridge / tail / jet ) or his morphological class 0 ( amorphous ) ; the latter does not correspond to any of our classes .",
    "@xcite adopted a similar two - fold classification ( see also @xcite ) , according to the strength of the interaction and the degree of distortion of the host galaxies and combined the two to a `` perturbation '' class . @xcite",
    "considered the interaction strength and age as the two major parameters in their interaction classification system , following a more or less subjective evolutionary `` sequence '' . in our approach , the interaction class represents the strength of the _ actual _ tidal perturbation between the two galaxies , while the morphological class represents the level of response of the target galaxy to a current or earlier interaction .",
    "thus , we can recognize an early evolutionary phase ( close encounter and large distortions ) , as well as , a quiescent phase that presumably corresponds to the end of the merging sequence ( isolated and symmetric hosts ) .",
    "any other combination of observed characteristics is degenerate between interaction strength and interaction age and thus its interpretation is subject to an _ a priori _ adopted evolutionary scheme . in order to disentangle these various factors as much as possible ,",
    "we have chosen to parametrize _ independently _ the strength of the gravitational perturbation , as a function of the projected separation and relative mass of the perturber galaxy ( unlike the previous works where these factors were blended in the interaction classification schemes ) .",
    "this is explained in the following section .      the classification scheme described above allows for a qualification of the general environmental and interaction properties of our samples .",
    "we would like to also determine and quantify the factors that `` affect '' the observed nuclear activity type and the development of ir excess in these objects .",
    "we judge whether our target galaxy is isolated or not by estimating the strength of the tidal interaction with the candidate companion galaxies .",
    "this is proportional to @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the total mass ( disk+halo ) and @xmath5 the major axis diameter of the galaxy and the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 are referring to the companion ( secondary ) and target ( primary ) galaxies , respectively ; r is the perigalactic distance ( at closer passage ) of the perturber galaxy ( @xcite ) .",
    "dahari s 1984 approximation for the galaxy mass was a proportionality with its diameter to the 1.5 power ( appropriate for early type spirals ) .",
    "he thus defined the interaction strength parameter as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the projected separation between the two galaxies . as we shall see later , dahari found a median separation @xmath9=1.4@xmath10 for his ( redshift limited ) seyfert sample and defined as `` strong '' interactions those with @xmath111 .",
    "@xcite modeled the gravitational instability flows in interacting systems and found that the minimum strength of an interaction needed to trigger nuclear activity implies @xmath120.05 ( for low halo systems ) . assuming the minimum encounter separation to be @xmath13 , byrd concluded that the minimum dimensions for a companion galaxy to destabilize the primary s disk is @xmath14 ( which , according to these authors , caused dahari to miss 50% of companions for the redshifts of his sample , due to the poss limitations ) . assuming an exponential light profile for the companion galaxies",
    ", it follows that the limiting magnitude is @xmath15 ( for most of the objects we use the @xmath16 bands ) .",
    "for comparison , the interacting galaxies in the vorontsov - velyaminov catalogue ( @xcite ) have a @xmath17 .    by using the above criteria , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , we are more likely to include companions that are likely to tidally perturb our target galaxies , than most previous studies . we used the conventional limiting search radius of 3@xmath20 for all our objects , which we justify in terms of homogeneity , given the limited image sizes .",
    "such a choice is biased towards a particular stage of the interaction ( close to perigalacticon ) and possibly excludes hyperbolic encounters ( the companion can move fast from perigalacticon to large distances ) . however , these will be common limitations for all our samples , the main purpose of this study being to probe the occurrence and stages of strong interactions in each of them , focusing on their inter - comparison .",
    "since we are not interested in the density of environments but rather in the properties of the companions that are most likely to have perturbed our target galaxies , we have chosen to parametrize the brightest companion within our search radius _ and _ the closest companion to the target galaxy . in",
    "what follows , these will be referred to as the `` brightest '' and `` closest '' companions .",
    "their magnitudes , dimensions and separations are scaled to those of the primary galaxy .",
    "thus , the relevant parameters in what follows will be : @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 . for this study",
    "we use the totality of our imaged samples that is , 21 seyfert 1 , 33 seyfert 2 and 16 cold galaxies .",
    "results are presented in table  [ tab1 ] and figure  [ f1 ] . on the left panels of the latter we show the distribution of the three ( sub)samples in interaction classes . within each interaction class",
    "we mark the morphological classification .",
    "the ordinate indicates the fraction of objects within each bin .",
    "the strongly interacting systems were defined in the previous section , on the basis of their environments and distorted morphologies .",
    "they are classified in two morphological groups , with or without bars / rings , as illustrated in table  [ tab2 ] under morphological classes _ b / r _ and _ normal _ , respectively .",
    "the main conclusions of our interaction classification are :    \\(i ) although there is a relative overlap in interaction properties between the three ( sub)samples , in general seyfert 1s tend to be isolated , seyfert 2s include different interaction types and cold galaxies tend to be strongly interacting systems .",
    "\\(ii ) 57% of the warm seyfert 1s are isolated and about half of them show tidal features . from the rest of this subsample ,",
    "29% have companions but do not obviously interact with them and only 14% of our warm seyfert 1s appear in strongly interacting or merging systems .",
    "moreover , within each interaction class , bars or rings are not common features .",
    "\\(iii ) seyfert 2s show a remarkable spread in their interaction properties : approximately 27% are isolated systems , 33% have companions , 30% are strongly interacting and 9% are merger systems . again , within each interaction class , bars or rings are not common .",
    "\\(iv ) cold galaxies are clearly very different objects or in a different phase in their lifetimes , compared to the warm galaxies : 63% of them lie in strongly interacting systems and 12% are mergers .",
    "18% galaxies have companions but not disruptive encounters , although all the objects in this class show some type of instability ( bar / ring or tidal ) that is likely to be triggered by their companion(s ) . only one cold object ( @xmath257% ) , iras 02439 - 7455 , appears in the class of isolated systems .",
    "this is likely to be the result of our definition of companionship , since a smaller galaxy lies within @xmath258 kpc projected distance but is 5 magnitudes fainter in @xmath16 , thus was rejected by our selection criteria ( described in the previous section ) . to test the differences between these binned distributions we used the @xmath26-test , with the null hypothesis of matching frequencies between any two samples .",
    "we find that the null hypothesis can be safely rejected in all cases ( significance level @xmath270.01 ) .    in the same figure  [ f1 ] ( right panels )",
    "we show the distribution of the three ( sub)samples in morphological classes .",
    "we find that :    \\(i ) 38% of the seyfert 1s show normal morphologies while 19% are purely barred or / and ringed systems .",
    "38% have some prominent tidal feature , the large majority of which are in isolated systems .",
    "the combination of bar / ring+tidal features is not common ( only one object ) and the same holds for double nucleus merging systems ( one object ) .",
    "seyfert 1s with normal morphologies can have any type of environment , while galaxies showing some type of disk instability are preferentially isolated systems .",
    "\\(ii ) 33% of the seyfert 2s appear to have normal morphologies . among the rest , 9% ( of the total subsample ) are purely barred / ringed systems and 48% show at least one prominent tidal feature , the majority of which are in strongly interacting systems .",
    "the simultaneous occurrence of a bar / ring and some tidal feature is more common here ( 21% of the total subsample ) .",
    "finally , 9% of the seyfert 2 subsample ( 3 objects ) are double nucleus mergers . within each morphological class ,",
    "objects with companions or strongly interacting systems tend to be more common , except of normal galaxies that can reside in any type of environment .",
    "\\(iii ) only one cold object appears to have normal morphology .",
    "69% of the sample show tidal morphologies , among which one third shows also a bar or ring instability and only one object does not belong to a strongly interacting system . two objects ( 12% of the sample )",
    "are purely barred / ringed systems and a similar fraction are double nucleus mergers .",
    "the large spread in morphological properties ( causing statistically similar mean absolute and standard deviations ) for the three ( sub)samples , makes it difficult to test the statistical significance of the differences between them .",
    "in summary , we find a clear progression in environmental properties and interaction stage between the three ( sub)samples : the fraction of isolated systems dramatically decreases from seyfert 1s to seyfert 2s and to cold galaxies .",
    "the fraction of disruptive encounters over simple neighbouring is large in cold galaxies and small in seyfert 1s , while there is almost an equal fraction of them in seyfert 2s .",
    "similarly , the merger rate increases from seyfert 1s through seyfert 2s to cold galaxies .",
    "thus , it would appear that _ the distinction between seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies is not only one of simple orientation , but that the latter occur in different environments , `` intermediate '' between seyfert 1s and cold galaxies .",
    "_ this conclusion is further reinforced by the comparison of host morphologies : there is a dramatic decrease in the fraction of normal host morphologies between the warm and cold samples , although this is not very different between the two seyfert types .",
    "the fraction of hosts showing tidal disturbances increases from seyfert 1s through seyfert 2s to cold galaxies ; since in the former case most of these galaxies are isolated while in the latter are strongly interacting systems , this means that also the _ shape _ of tidal features is different in seyfert 1 hosts ( one - sided tails or fans ) compared to seyfert 2 and cold hosts ( tidal arms , bridges and tails ) . finally , if the presence of bars and rings is independent of environmental properties or interaction stage , there is a progressively larger fraction of these features from seyfert 1 through seyfert 2 to cold galaxy hosts .",
    "however , if we exclude the strongly interacting systems , this fraction is similar for seyfert 1s and 2s . the latter observation and the fact that similar fractions of seyfert 1s and 2s have normal hosts in our samples , may indicate that _ the orientation unification applies for some of the seyfert 2 galaxies , but a fraction of these ( the strongly interacting ) are intrinsically different objects than the seyfert 1s . _",
    "to further investigate the seyfert type 1 vs 2 relation , we searched for connections between environments and host morphologies and the optical and ir properties , for our three ( sub)samples . in figure  [ f2 ] we plot some of the most important correlations .",
    "\\(i ) there is a significant correlation between seyfert 2 optical ( in particular disk ) luminosities and interaction class ( top row left panel ) .",
    "moreover , within each interaction class , bars / rings or tidal features further increase the disk luminosity ( top row right panel ) . _ in paper ii we had found that seyfert 2 disks are larger and brighter than seyfert 1 disks ; this seems to be related to the largest fraction of interacting systems among the former .",
    "_    \\(ii ) seyfert 1s , on the other hand , show no correlation of nuclear optical luminosities with interaction class , but tidal and barred / ringed morphologies seem to increase their _ disk _ brightness ( top row right panel )",
    ". however , this is small number statistics since we have photometric measures for few non - isolated seyfert 1s . indeed , when we use the integrated @xmath28-band magnitudes given by @xcite , we find a tendency for seyfert 1s to become optically _ fainter _ at more advanced interaction class ( second row from top , left panel ) .",
    "this is most likely an effect of increased dust extinction in these systems .",
    "\\(iii ) nuclear and disk colours are uniformly distributed for seyfert 2s in all interaction / morphological classes ( third row from top , left panel ) . for seyfert 1s",
    "however , their nuclei are significantly bluer for isolated galaxies , compared to the other interaction classes for which colours are similar to the seyfert 2s . _ in paper ii we have shown that seyfert 1 nuclei tend to be overall bluer compared to seyfert 2s , which we demonstrate here is related to the larger occurrence of the former in isolated galaxies .",
    "_    \\(iv ) seyfert 2s show a clear trend for their inner colour gradients to become bluer with interaction `` strength '' ( third row from top , right panel ) .",
    "there are too few seyfert 1s with measured gradients to assess any such correlation . _",
    "as we have pointed out in paper iv , seyfert 2 colour gradients are indicative of strong starbursts , that we demonstrate here to be related to galactic interactions .",
    "_    \\(v ) for the cold sample , there is no clear trend for optical luminosities to correlate with environment or morphology , but they are on the average fainter than seyfert 2s ( and seyfert 1s ) for similar interaction / morphological classes ( top row panels ) .",
    "\\(vi ) in papers ii and iii we have seen that seyfert 1s are more centrally concentrated compared to seyfert 2s and cold galaxies .",
    "in figure  [ f2 ] ( second row from top , right panel ) we see that the degree of light concentration is also a function of morphological class , this being a stronger effect for seyfert 1s .",
    "\\(vii ) we do not observe any bimodality in any of the above properties or correlations in seyfert 2s but rather continuous distributions that lie between the ( generally ) different loci of seyfert 1 and cold galaxies in most of these diagrams .",
    "\\(i ) we find that the 25 @xmath0 m emission is correlated with interaction class for the warm seyfert 2s and possibly for the cold galaxies too ( figure  [ f2 ] , bottom left panel ) . a similar good correlation of @xmath29 with interaction class exists for the cold sample ( not plotted ) .",
    "the latter is not obvious for the seyfert 2s , except for the merger systems that have consistently higher ir luminosities at all wavelengths , compared to the rest of the sample . for the correlation shown in figure  [ f2 ] , within each interaction class the objects showing tidal features have larger @xmath30 compared to the barred / ringed and normal morphologies , this being also true for the warm seyfert 1 subsample .",
    "\\(ii ) in isolated seyferts or those with normal morphologies , the @xmath30 is comparable for the two nuclear types but for tidal morphologies , strongly interacting or merging systems , @xmath30 is significantly enhanced in seyfert 2s ( bottom left panel ) .",
    "this behaviour would be consistent with a bimodality within the seyfert 2 subsample .",
    "_ in paper ii we had found that seyfert 2s show overall stronger ir emission compared to seyfert 1s and we had attributed this to warm dust in their disks . here",
    "we show that this result is probably due to the larger fraction of strongly interacting systems within the warm seyfert 2 subsample .",
    "_    \\(iii ) cold galaxies have lower @xmath30 than both seyfert 1s and 2s , for the same interaction or morphological class , while in general similar ( or larger ) @xmath29 luminosity .",
    "the most straightforward interpretation for the above correlations is that _ the 25 @xmath0 m emission in seyfert galaxies is mainly due to warm dust heated by the agn , unless these are strongly interacting systems in which case disk star formation causes significant excess 25 @xmath0 m emission in seyfert 2s .",
    "far - ir emission on the other hand , is mainly due to warm dust in the host disks and is similarly enhanced by strong interactions in warm and cold galaxies .",
    "_ this would be consistent with the observed absence of a correlation between 25 - 60 colour indices and interaction or morphological class : _ although the frequency of disruptive encounters is an important discriminator between samples selected according to their mid - ir colours , the strength of these encounters is not the only factor determining the mid - ir excess_.    \\(iv ) there is an important correlation found between ir loudness and interaction class for seyfert 1s , shown in figure  [ f2 ] ( bottom right panel ) . in paper",
    "ii we have defined the ir loudness using both the nuclear and total optical @xmath28 magnitudes . here",
    "we find that seyfert 2 ( and cold ) _ nuclei _ are ir louder compared to seyfert 1 nuclei independently of interaction class , which supports the suggestion put forward in paper ii , that the _ nuclear @xmath31 is primarily a measure of dust extinction in warm seyfert 2s_. isolated seyfert 2 galaxies are also ir louder than seyfert 1s when considering the _ total _ @xmath31 but for the other interaction classes there is a larger scatter of values since the dust obscuration and 25 @xmath0 m enhancement both affect this index in seyfert 2s . in non - isolated seyfert 1s on the other hand ,",
    "ir - loudness correlates tightly with interaction class , this being mainly due to the decreasing optical luminosity ( section 4.1 ( ii ) ) .",
    "_ in paper ii we had shown that in seyfert 1s , ir loudness anti - correlates with optical luminosities and galaxy sizes and we had suggested it is a measure of dust extinction and host luminosity .",
    "here we show that this is the effect of interacting members in this class , while isolated seyfert 1s have a large range of optical and ir luminosities . _",
    "in the previous section we have shown that some of the important differences between seyfert type 1 and 2 galaxies are strongly related to their ( different ) environmental properties , providing clear evidence against the simple orientation model often postulated for seyfert galaxies .",
    "it is thus of great interest to determine what environmental factors influence the ( observed ) nuclear seyfert type .",
    "moreover , we have seen that cold galaxies have markedly different environmental properties than those of the warm sample .",
    "however , it is not clear whether an ir - cold galaxy _ will _ develop nuclear activity or , alternatively , what is the process responsible for `` warming '' the mid - ir colours of interacting seyfert galaxies . in this section",
    "we shall address these questions by attempting to quantify the _ close _ environmental properties of the non - isolated objects in all our samples .",
    "these include 8 seyfert 1s , 20 seyfert 2s and 12 cold galaxies .",
    "in section 2 we have defined the relevant quantities , @xmath21 , @xmath32 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 . in figure  [ f3 ]",
    "we plot their distributions for the brightest and the closest companions , respectively .",
    "the median values and standard deviations of these distributions are given in table  [ tab2 ] . before discussing the results we draw attention to the seyfert 1 galaxy , iras 02253 - 1642 , which appears to be a strongly interacting system with tidal morphology .",
    "however , closer examination shows that one of the two objects is compact and star - like while the other is highly elongated and curved , suggesting that this might be a lensed background galaxy .",
    "this object is included in the seyfert 1 samples of a number of recent studies but no individual information is given for it . in what follows ,",
    "we include it in our histograms and plots , but we also discuss the effects of its inclusion in our statistical results ( when relevant ) .",
    "let us first consider the brightest companions in all samples , selected as described in section 2 ( four upper panels of figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "the projected separations @xmath9 normalized by the diameter of the primary @xmath10 span a large range for the warm sample , with a median value of 1.2 ( median projected separation @xmath2540 kpc ) for the seyfert 2s and 1.57 ( median projected separation @xmath2529 kpc ) for the seyfert 1s .",
    "in fact , the distribution of seyfert 1 bright companions is rather flat , showing a similar probability for a galaxy to have a companion at 1@xmath10 or 4 @xmath10 , while the seyfert 2 distribution is more segregated between 1 - 2@xmath10 .",
    "the cold galaxies show a very different distribution of separations , peaking at much smaller values with a median 0.56 ( observed separation @xmath2522 kpc ) . the f and k - s tests show significantly different warm and cold galaxy distributions .",
    "these results do not change significantly if iras 02253 - 1642 is excluded from the warm seyfert 1 sample .",
    "the smaller separations found for the cold sample agree with our previous results that it contains almost exclusively strongly interacting systems .",
    "the difference in mean separations found between seyfert 1s and 2s is expected , given the larger fraction of disruptive encounters found among the latter .",
    "the median relative separation in dahari s seyfert sample was @xmath24=1.4 ( @xcite ) , comparable to the median for the whole warm sample .",
    "for all our objects ( warm and cold ) the absolute projected separations were @xmath33120 kpc , which is approximately the typical search radius in most of the recent studies of ( optically selected ) seyfert environments .",
    "galaxy separation is not the only factor that determines the strength of an interaction , the tidal force being also proportional to the relative mass of the companion ( section 2 ) .",
    "since we have no direct `` mass '' measure , we can use instead the relative sizes and/or luminosities of the two galaxies . in figure  [ f3 ]",
    "we show the distribution of major axis ratios and magnitude differences between companion and primary galaxy .",
    "we find that the relative sizes of the seyfert 1 and 2 companions are quite similar , while the cold companions have the tendency to be larger .",
    "however , the three distributions are statistically similar , according to the f ( variances ) , student s t ( means ) and k - s tests , with medians in the range 0.5 - 0.8 .",
    "@xcite imposed a lower limit to the companions diameters @xmath340.25@xmath10 , in order to be able to disentangle stars from galaxies on the poss plates . from figure  [ f3 ]",
    "we see that a similar limit would have caused us to miss @xmath2530% of the seyfert 2 and cold galaxy companions .",
    "the companion relative brightnesses , shown in figure  [ f3 ] , are also similar for the two seyfert subsamples , while the cold companions are shifted to somewhat fainter magnitudes ( that is , larger @xmath35 m ) .",
    "however , the three distributions do not differ at a statistically significant level and their medians are in the range 1.55 - 1.8 mag .",
    "@xcite have imposed a selection criterion more stringent than ours , @xmath35m(max)=3 mag , based on the distribution of relative companion magnitudes in the vorontsov - velyaminov _ atlas and catalogue of interacting galaxies _ ( @xcite ) . from figure  [ f3 ]",
    "we see that such a limit would cause us to miss @xmath2520% of the companions in each sample .",
    "let us now consider the interaction strength , @xmath21 , that includes both companion mass and separation .",
    "we find that seyfert 1s tend to have a tail to lower @xmath21 values ( in particular if we exclude the uncertain galaxy mentioned earlier ) and seyfert 2s a tail to higher values .",
    "the median value of @xmath21 is 0.12 for both subsamples ( 0.10 for the seyfert 1 subsample , if we exclude the one ambiguous object discussed earlier ) .",
    "the cold galaxies have significantly larger @xmath21 values , with a median @xmath21=1.44 .",
    "the k - s test shows that the null hypothesis , that two samples are drawn from the same parent population of @xmath21 values , is confirmed for the seyfert 1 and 2 subsamples and rejected for the warm and cold samples , at significance levels @xmath2595% .",
    "dahari has found that the fraction of seyfert / normal galaxies in his sample is @xmath257 when @xmath111 and drops to 2 when 1@xmath360.05 , which suggests that seyferts are more likely to have close and/or more massive companions to perturb them .",
    "the median @xmath21 value in his seyfert sample was 1.18 ; he suggested that @xmath111 defines `` strong '' interactions .",
    "@xcite showed that tidal triggering can be a physically _ sufficient _ mechanism to induce nuclear activity , through the formation of bar or spiral instabilities and consequent mass inflow into the nuclear regions .",
    "they modeled the gravitational instability flows in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath37 halo / disk mass and found such instabilities to set in for @xmath111 independently of @xmath38 , while for @xmath110.05 only for low halo systems . among our warm seyfert galaxies with detected companions ,",
    "we find a similar fraction of types 1 and 2 , 25 - 30% , to have @xmath391 this fraction increasing to @xmath4050% for the cold sample .",
    "we conclude that , _ if the presence of bright companions within a radius of three galaxy diameters dominates the environmental effects in ir - luminous galaxies , our results indicate that the interaction strength ( and in particular the companion proximity ) is an important discriminator between warm and cold samples_.      let us now consider the properties of the closest companions for the three ( sub)samples ( four lower panels of figure  [ f3 ] ) .",
    "we find shifts but no major differences in the companion relative `` masses '' ( that is , sizes and magnitudes ) between warm seyfert types 1 and 2 .",
    "however , we find significant difference in the distribution of projected separations between these two subsamples : for seyfert 2s , the separations are shifted and peak at smaller values . on the other hand , the seyfert 2 and cold galaxy companions have similar relative projected separations ( the k - s test shows that the null hypothesis of matching distributions is confirmed at the 97% significance level ) .",
    "the most important effect is depicted in the interaction strength , @xmath21 , distributions : the two seyfert subsamples have very different distributions and means ( in particular when the ambiguous seyfert 1 galaxy , discussed above , is excluded ) .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath21 distributions are very similar for the seyfert 2 and cold ( sub)samples ( although the k - s statistical significance remains less than 95% ) .",
    "the different @xmath21 distributions are likely to reflect the denser environments of seyfert 2s ( and cold galaxies ) compared to s1s .",
    "we thus conclude that _ in warm non - isolated seyferts , the proximity of close companions seems to be the best discriminator between their nuclear activity types_.      now we shall investigate how the interaction strength correlates to the ir properties in our samples .",
    "the main correlations found are shown in figure  [ f4 ] .",
    "( the seyfert 1 galaxy with the largest @xmath21 and smallest @xmath9 in this figure , is the uncertain object mentioned earlier and it is detached from the rest of the sample in most diagrams . ) in order to better understand our correlations , we denote with crossed circles the strongly interacting seyfert 2 galaxies ( interaction class @xmath9 ) and with open circles those in interaction class @xmath41 .",
    "our main conclusions are :    \\(i ) _ upper four panels _ : for cold galaxies the ir luminosities , both @xmath30 and @xmath29 , correlate with interaction strength ( the spearman s rank - correlation test gives correlation coefficients 0.60 and 0.67 at 0.02 significance level ) and projected separation ( correlation coefficient -0.61 at 0.03 significance level ) , in the sense that galaxies with closer companions and larger @xmath21 tend to be ir - brighter .",
    "this correlation holds better when the brightest companions are considered .",
    "there is a similar tendency for the strongly interacting seyfert 2s to have larger ir luminosities , compared to the rest of the seyfert 2 subsample and to the seyfert 1s . moreover ,",
    "figure  [ f4 ] shows that for similar interaction strengths , warm seyferts of both types have larger @xmath30 than cold galaxies , while warm and cold samples overlap in the @xmath42 vs @xmath21 diagrams .",
    "these results thus support the conclusions that we reached in section 4 , from different parameters : _ the excess @xmath30 in warm seyferts is mainly due to the agn contribution , although in strongly interacting seyfert 2s it is further enhanced by star formation . in cold galaxies ,",
    "interaction induced star formation is the source of ir activity at all wavelengths_.    \\(ii ) _ lower four panels _ : in seyfert 1s the ir - loudness coefficients correlate with interaction strength and anti - correlate with relative separation ( in particular when their brightest companions are considered ) .",
    "the spearman s rank - correlation test gives a correlation coefficient of -0.9 to -1.0 with significance better than 0.005 for ir - loudness vs @xmath43 and a correlation coefficient 0.9 with significance better than 0.004 for ir - loudness vs separation .",
    "_ we have seen previously that the ir - loudness in seyfert 1s correlates with interaction stage and here we find that within similar interaction stages it scales further with interaction strength_.    \\(iii ) we searched for correlations between the ir colour indices @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath21 .",
    "we find no correlation for any of the samples .",
    "this is a significant result because it indicates that _ although the strength of tidal perturbations is a discriminator between warm and cold samples , the mid - ir excess ( or lack of ) is not a simple function of interaction strength _ ( a conclusion reached in section 4.2 from different parameters ) .      at this point",
    "it is interesting to consider the properties of the four seyfert galaxies in our cold sample .",
    "two of them , type 2 iras 04265 - 4801 ( interacting ) and type 1 iras 06506 + 5025 ( barred galaxy with companion ; labeled _ 1 _ in figure  [ f4 ] ) show the lowest ir luminosities among the cold sample . in paper",
    "ii we have seen that they are also faint in optical wavelengths ( among the faintest compared to the respective warm seyfert subsamples ) and have very red colours , at all spatial scales .",
    "moreover , they both have the smallest @xmath21 compared to the rest of the cold sample .",
    "although they harbour a seyfert nucleus , it is likely that large amounts of cooler dust in their disks or / and an intrinsically faint agn are responsible for their cold mid - ir colours .",
    "the first option is certainly the case for iras 04265 - 4801 which suffers large extinction so that even its nucleus can not be unambiguously identified ( see also paper iv ) . iras 06506",
    "+ 5025 has a rather complex colour distribution ( paper iv ) and both the above factors are likely to be responsible for its inclusion in the cold sample .",
    "the other two cold seyferts , iras 23128 - 5919 ( merger ) and iras 19184 - 7404 ( strongly interacting ) , both of nuclear type 2 , are among the most ir - luminous objects in the cold sample . the latter object is shown in figure  [ f4 ] ( labeled _ 2 _ ) to have similar interaction strength and @xmath30 as the warm sample .",
    "the cold 25 - 60 @xmath0 m colours of these two galaxies result from the fact that their far - ir luminosities are also enhanced ( compared to the rest of the cold _ and _ the warm sample ) .",
    "thus , unusually large amounts of dust and/or strong star formation in their disks could be invoked to explain their mid - ir colours , although we have no direct evidence for this , as we lack photometric data for both objects .",
    "although such a small number ( four ) of cases is not enough to establish any firm conclusions , the _ existence _ of these very different cases of cold seyfert galaxies indicates that _ the occurrence of a mid - ir excess must be related to some intrinsic properties of the host galaxy rather than being merely a transition period in the evolution of strongly interacting systems_. the evolutionary interpretation could account for the fact that cold galaxies show statistically larger @xmath21 ( section 5.1 ) and might indeed be the case for the two most powerful cold seyfert 2s .",
    "however , the existence of the other two cold seyferts shows that effects related to the properties of the progenitor galaxy ( such as gas or dust content ) and/or the geometry of the interaction , must be also important for the development or lack of a mid - ir excess .",
    "the merger systems in our samples ( interaction class ( mg ) ) deserve special mention .",
    "these are systems possessing double nuclei within a common envelope , or merger remnants with two tidal tails emanating from the same body in opposite directions .",
    "there are three double - nucleus mergers in our warm sample , one seyfert 1 and two seyfert 2s , and one double - nucleus merger in the cold sample which is also spectroscopically classified as a seyfert 2 .",
    "furthermore , the warm seyfert 2 and cold subsamples contain one advanced merger each : in the first case we can hardly identify the two nuclei in continuum light but they are better visible in @xmath46 emission ; in the second , the two nuclei are not any more distinguishable but the remnant has the characteristic two - tail appearance of a recent merger . in table",
    "[ tab3 ] we list some of their properties and their @xmath16-band images are shown in figure  [ f5 ] .",
    "we find that the three warm seyfert 2 mergers , independently of coalescence state , have larger ir and optical total and disk luminosities and warmer 60 - 100 @xmath0 m colours compared to the seyfert 1 merger case , but also fainter nuclei and redder optical colours .",
    "these properties indicate that there is a larger fraction of warm dust in the _ nuclear _ regions of the seyfert 2 mergers .",
    "the cold seyfert 2 double nucleus merger shows similarly large ir luminosities and warm 60 - 100 @xmath0 m colours ( no optical photometry available ) as the warm seyfert 2 cases .",
    "@xcite found that 47% of their ulfir sample show double nuclei and suggested that this must be typical for the ultraluminous ir phase ( whose lifetime is estimated to be 2@xmath4710@xmath48 - 10@xmath49 yr ) .",
    "we indeed see from table  [ tab3 ] that all our merger systems , with the exception of the warm seyfert 1 , have @xmath5010@xmath51 . in paper",
    "iv we have shown that the four _ double nucleus _",
    "mergers have remarkably similar colour and line emission morphologies : one of the two nuclei is brighter and redder , the line emission being centered on it with an extended morphology in direction perpendicular to the line connecting the two nuclei . in the case of iras 13536 + 1836 it was shown that the brightest nucleus is also the activated one ( @xcite ) ; the same object is optically classified as a seyfert 2 but shows seyfert 1 characteristics in polarized light .",
    "given their common properties , it is likely that the other three double nucleus mergers are similar objects to iras 13536 + 1836 .",
    "the evidence for larger extinction in the seyfert 2 mergers suggests that their optical spectral classification is most likely to be affected by obscuration .",
    "if there is an evolutionary sequence between the seyfert 1 and 2 types , as we suggest later in this paper , _ the seyfert 2 merger cases might be representing this rare phase of transition from nuclear type 2 to type 1_. the small number of ( six ) objects examined here and their varied properties consist circumstantial evidence but do not allow to further establish any firm conclusions . a follow - up project to map the detailed morphologies , kinematics and ionization of selected double nucleus mergers",
    "is under way .",
    "whether there is a preferential occurrence of interacting / merging systems and morphological distortions in seyfert galaxies is a controversial issue and , despite the large number of related studies , non conclusive .",
    "there have been several recent reviews of the statistical properties of seyfert galaxy environments ( @xcite ) .",
    "such studies involve mostly optically selected samples and are mainly of two types : they involve studying either the frequency of agn occurrence in morphologically disturbed galaxies or the frequency of disturbed host morphologies and/or nearby companion galaxies in nearby agns ( seyferts ) . in the first approach , no excess of seyfert nuclei ( and often even a lack of them ) is found in disruptive systems ; a marginal excess of seyferts is found among systems at lower interaction levels ( @xcite ) . in the second approach",
    "the results are more contradictory : an excess of companions for seyferts compared to normal galaxies has been reported ( @xcite ) but other studies indicate that seyfert and control sample environments are comparable ( @xcite ) . in fact , the situation seems even more complicated as sometimes excess of only faint ( @xcite ) or on the contrary only bright ( @xcite ) companions is claimed . the reasons for these discrepancies are usually attributed to differing definitions of `` environments '' , data limitation in detecting companions , biased working samples and lack of or poorly defined control samples .",
    "the numbers for the apparent companion excess in seyfert samples vary widely .",
    "@xcite found that 40% of his seyferts have companions , compared to only 23% of the control sample and he suggested that the excess of companions among seyferts corresponds to large interaction strengths @xmath391 .",
    "@xcite showed that the fraction of seyferts with companions in the dahari sample could be as large as 50% , when account is taken of companions not considered , due to the limiting magnitudes and maximum search radius imposed by dahari .",
    "@xcite , on the other hand , found that each of the two seyfert types show excess of companions up to @xmath2512% , compared to a maximum of 5% for the control samples .    when seyfert 1s and seyfert 2s are considered separately a much clearer environmental connection appears .",
    "in general , the relative densities in seyfert 2 environments are found to be 1.6 - 2.7 larger than those of normal galaxies , while seyfert 1s have identical or smaller companion densities compared to normal galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the larger density of seyfert 2 companions seems moreover to depend strongly on morphological type ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "different host morphological types are often postulated , with type 1s residing in earlier type hosts than type 2s ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , these results are contradicted by other recent studies .",
    "@xcite reports that spiral structure does not seem predominant amongst his seyfert sample ( as postulated by @xcite ) , although he finds that in general seyferts have axial ratios @xmath330.5 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found no significant differences in the hubble types of seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies and concluded that the enhanced star formation activity , often postulated for seyfert 2s , does not seem to be related to the prevalence of late - type disks among them .    how do our results compare to those of previous studies ?",
    "the fraction of systems with companions is generally larger among our ir - warm seyfert sample compared to the optical seyfert samples : 43% for the warm seyfert 1s and 63% for the warm seyfert 2s . as we mentioned earlier",
    ", this would be consistent with the supposition that ir - activity does probe strong interactions .",
    "more importantly , we find twice as many seyfert 2s than seyfert 1s in strongly interacting / merging systems , in rough agreement with the `` optically - based '' results . we also find ( paper iii ) a tendency for warm seyfert 1s to reside in earlier type hosts ( peaking around so - so / a ) compared to warm seyfert 2s ( peaking at sa types ) . among our warm seyferts with companions we find a smaller fraction than in dahari s sample , 25 - 30% , to have @xmath391 ( a _ similar _ fraction for types 1 and 2 ) this fraction increasing to 50% for the cold ( mostly non - seyfert ) sample . following our results described in sections 3 - 5 we put forward the following suggestion : _",
    "although the evidence for a causal connection between galactic interactions and nuclear activity in our sample is substantial , the development of nuclear activity and its observability depend on the time evolution since the last interaction , as well as on the host intrinsic properties_.    we now address the question of whether important differences exist between isolated seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies . in optical samples ,",
    "the fraction of solitary seyferts ranges between 10 - 25% .",
    "this is comparable to the fraction we find for warm seyferts ( similar for type 1s and 2s ) if we consider undisturbed , non - barred / ringed systems . however including the latter , the fractions of isolated systems increase by 1.5 and 3 times for seyfert 2s and 1s respectively , that is , _",
    "the majority of warm seyfert 1s lie in `` isolated '' hosts with disturbed morphologies_. this suggests that these seyfert 1s are only `` pseudo - isolated '' .",
    "multiple tidal perturbations from faint companions ( too faint to be considered as such ) could be responsible for generating non - axisymmetric potentials such as bars or rings and in fact this process was previously invoked to explain the significant fraction of isolated seyferts observed by @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the apparent isolation of seyfert 1s in our sample could be a long - lasting effect of encounters , in the sense that dynamical friction in their vicinity has gradually led to removal of companions ( @xcite ) .",
    "whichever of these two scenarios - different environments or evolutionary effect - applies , our data show that _ there is a fundamental difference between the seyfert 1 and 2 `` isolated '' galaxies in our sample_. we favour the evolutionary effect for one more reason : an important conclusion in this paper is that , among non - isolated seyferts there is no significant difference in the relative size and luminosity of companions between the two types ( sections 5.1 and 5.2 ) .",
    "in other words there is no reason to postulate different , more disruptive environments for seyfert 2s .",
    "the question arises : how common are disk instabilities and what do they imply for the recent interaction history of a galaxy ? from a theoretical point of view , the modeling of interactions / mergers between two disk / halo systems of comparable mass shows commonly tidal triggering of central bars , that perturb the orbits of gas and stars in the host galaxy causing infall and circumnuclear star formation , with probable subsequent agn feeding / triggering ( @xcite ) .",
    "although earlier observational work indicates a prevalence of kpc - scale distortions ( bar / ring formations ) in seyferts ( @xcite ) , according to the most recent optical and ir studies the frequency of occurrence of such features among seyferts ( 25 - 30% ) is similar to that among normal spirals ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , a few workers find that the presence of bars _ inhibits _ agn segregation ( @xcite ) .",
    "this observational evidence suggests that either bars are not a universal fueling mechanism , that the bar formation inhibits gas infall ( stabilizing the disk ) and thus agn triggering , or that bars tend to be destroyed after the formation of a black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "we believe that the lack of a significant excess of bars in agns is connected to an evolutionary scenario for seyferts . in our sample of warm seyferts ,",
    "if we exclude strongly interacting systems , we find a similar fraction of barred / ringed galaxies among seyfert 1s and 2s .",
    "however , the former tend to be purely barred / ringed and to reside in isolated hosts , whereas the latter can have some other tidal feature as well and most of them have at least one detectable companion . moreover , all the barred / ringed strongly interacting warm seyferts are type 2 .",
    "we believe that these numbers reflect differing interaction _ stages _ for seyfert 1s and 2s , while at the same time indicate an equal probability for seyfert 1s and 2s to develop bar or ring instabilities .",
    "it is of particular interest that bar / ring and tidal features seem to be mutually exclusive in seyfert 1s ( only one possible candidate ) , while their simultaneous appearance is common in seyfert 2s ( especially when strongly interacting systems are considered ) .",
    "this most likely reflects differing evolutionary lifetimes for the bar and tidal features and differing rates of bar vs tidal formation in different types of interactions ( see also section 6.4 ) .",
    "if interactions and seyfert activity are linked by an evolutionary sequence , we can ask whether starburst and seyfert activities are similarly linked .",
    "the ratio of seyfert to starburst galaxies was found to be a function of ir power and was suggested to be also a function of time since a merger occurred ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been proposed that agns and starburst galaxies are linked according to the following scenario : interactions or mergers of gas - rich spirals funnel gas into the nuclear regions , triggering intense star formation that produces the bulk of ir luminosity in the initial stages of the merging process .",
    "when the gas becomes more concentrated to the center ( @xmath331 kpc ) it feeds the central black hole and triggers an agn that dominates the luminosity output of the system and this corresponds to the peak ir - phase .",
    "as time goes by , superwinds from the newly formed stars will clear away interstellar material from the central regions , so that most of the circumnuclear starburst eventually stops , while the agn fueling continues for a while . during this phase ,",
    "the agn becomes visible and warmer ir colours might develop , this primarily depending on the small scale ( torus ) geometry ( for detailed description of similar scenarios and relevant references see the review papers of @xcite ) .",
    "a similar evolutionary scenario was suggested by @xcite , studying the interaction properties of a sample of iras galaxies with a range of ir and nuclear activity types .",
    "they found that the steep spectrum ( @xmath52 - 1.3 ) galaxies ( whether these are hii , liners or seyfert 2 ) are the younger and stronger interactors and show larger dust obscuration .",
    "on the other hand , the flat spectrum seyfert 1 and seyfert 2 galaxies appear to be intermediate age / strength interactors .",
    "the authors suggest that the ir - warmness possibly represents different evolutionary paths of active galaxies .",
    "the steep - spectrum seyfert 2s might be at an earlier evolutionary stage than the flat spectrum seyferts , the type 2s being hidden type 1s at the `` flat - spectrum stage '' .",
    "whether the steep - spectrum seyfert 2s will evolve to flat - spectrum seyfert 2s or to steep - spectrum low - luminosity agns ( such as liners ) is unclear .",
    "using polarimetric studies to detect hidden broad line regions ( blrs ) in seyfert 2 galaxies , tran ( 1993 , 1995a , 1995b , 1995c ) and @xcite are led to somewhat different conclusions : hidden ( blrs ) are found predominantly in interacting galaxies with warm mid - ir colours ( @xmath52 - 1.6 ) and smaller internal extinction .",
    "within the orientation model , this would mean intermediate ( between pole - on and edge - on ) torus viewing angles for the flat - spectrum ( warm ) seyfert 2 galaxies .",
    "it would also mean that interactions influence the visibility of the blr , by either producing the scattering `` mirrors '' that allow detection of the hidden seyfert 1 or on the contrary by producing the circumnuclear obscuring material that hides the blr of the seyfert 1 nucleus .",
    "in fact , @xcite suggests that the obscured seyfert 2 nuclei might represent an evolutionary stage between `` pure '' ( unobscured ) seyfert 2 and seyfert 1 type galaxies .",
    "this was inspired by the evolutionary scenarios connecting starburst and agn activity , suggested by @xcite . according to these ,",
    "interacting galaxies pass through an initial starburst phase before the agn dominates their power output : at earlier stages the galaxy appears as an ultraluminous seyfert 2 galaxy , later evolving to a seyfert 1 ( unless viewed edge - on ) , then to a lower luminosity agn and finally to a normal spiral as the nuclear activity ceases ( possible variations to this scenario are also suggested ) . finally , @xcite notes that most highly ir luminous ( @xmath5310@xmath54 ) galaxies , were found to be dusty seyfert 2s that later on were shown to be obscured seyfert 1s ( or , at those luminosities , qsos ) .",
    "our study of the ir warm and cold samples , selected according to the shape of their spectra between 25 and 60 @xmath0 m , probes such possible evolutionary link between starburst - dominated and agn - dominated ir emission . in papers",
    "ii - v we showed that in cold galaxies the bulk of their ir emission is dominated by warm dust in their disks , powered by strong star formation . in their large majority , these systems undergo disruptive encounters .",
    "their ir emission at all wavelengths increases with interaction strength and the 25 - 60 @xmath0 m colours become colder at smaller projected separations .",
    "furthermore , we found a transition in most observed properties , from the cold sample to the warm seyfert 2 and to the seyfert 1 samples : brighter nuclear magnitudes , bluer nuclear optical colours , bluer 12 - 100 @xmath0 m colours , decreasing ir - excess and ir loudness , increasing companion separations and decreasing interaction strengths .",
    "this transition could be further expanded for their structural ( bulge , disk ) parameters and host morphologies ( paper iii ) .",
    "our observational results thus , generally sustain an evolutionary scenario , such as the ones described above , between the cold and warm samples that offers a possible explanation for their differing dust temperatures and dominant activity type .",
    "however , the occurrence of four seyfert galaxies in our cold sample , showing a variety of optical and ir properties , indicates that other factors , such as the gas and dust content of the progenitors and maybe also the interaction geometry , are important in determining whether the galaxy will go through an ir - warm phase . in what follows",
    "we will argue for a similar evolutionary connection also between the warm seyfert 1 and 2 types , as evidenced from their strongly differing properties , described in papers ii - v .",
    "although star formation seems to be the dominant source of far - ir emission ( longwords of 60 @xmath0 m ) not only in starburst but also in seyfert galaxies , observational evidence has accumulated suggesting that the mid - ir emission originates near the nucleus and is a combination of nuclear and starburst thermal components ( @xcite ) .",
    "the relative contributions of these two components are postulated to be related to the type of seyfert activity , with highest dust temperatures for the type 1s .",
    "a number of important results relevant to these questions were demonstrated in papers ii - v : ( i ) warm seyfert 2 disks tend to be brighter than warm seyfert 1 disks at optical wavelengths and their mid- and far - ir properties correlate with total optical luminosities and host galaxy size , indicating that the bulk of seyfert 2 ir emission originates in their disks .",
    "( ii ) optical colours indicate that the warm seyfert 2s are _ overall _ more dusty than the warm seyfert 1s , their nuclei suffering the highest obscuration .",
    "( iii ) the 25 @xmath0 m emission in warm seyferts is primarily due to warm dust heated by the agn , but in strongly interacting systems ( and thus , primarily in seyfert 2s ) it is further enhanced by disk star formation .",
    "( iv ) the ir luminosity longwords of 60 @xmath0 m indicates mainly excess emission at large scales and is similarly enhanced by strong interactions in the warm and cold samples .",
    "the importance of disk and nuclear starbursts specifically in seyfert 2s is supported by a variety of observational studies covering a large wavelength range : strong far - ir and co emission by cool dust ( @xcite ) , strong extended mid - ir emission and spectral features ( @xcite ) , large n - ir l / m ratios ( @xcite ) , optical and uv spectral features and imaging ( @xcite ) . on the basis of near - ir colours and colour gradients",
    ", @xcite suggested the contribution of an intermediate - age stellar population ( @xmath5510@xmath49 years ) in the seyfert 2 disks , while mainly old stars are found in seyfert 1s .",
    "@xcite and @xcite argued that most of the optical and near - uv featureless continuum in seyfert 2s is produced by stars younger than 10@xmath48 years .",
    "@xcite suggested that the circumnuclear star formation in these objects is associated with the obscuring molecular torus . @xcite",
    "have argued that the larger _ disk _ star formation rate found in seyfert 2 galaxies is not likely to be due to larger molecular gas content but to rather more efficient star formation from similar gas amounts , which they attribute to the larger occurrence of distortions found in seyfert 2 disks . in paper iv",
    "we have shown ample evidence for the occurrence of strong star formation in the seyfert 2 disks : ( i ) colour and emission line distributions that suggest dust extinction associated with on - going star formation , mostly in spiral and tidal features ( ii ) negative radial colour gradients that correlate with interaction strength and ir luminosities ( see present paper ) ( iii ) large star formation rates as deduced from their ir emission longwords of 60 @xmath0 m ( iv ) starbursts of 1 - 0.5 gyr or younger , superposed on the older underlying galaxy population , in particular for strongly interacting systems .",
    "most of these properties are shared with the cold galaxies in our sample , while warm seyfert 1s show often opposite colour gradients and mostly older stellar populations , although in a few cases there is evidence for circumnuclear star formation .",
    "the plausibility of the evolutionary scenario in which strong interactions are responsible for both enhanced star formation and activation of the galactic nucleus , suggests that seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies might represent different phases in an evolutionary cycle .",
    "the observational evidence put forward in the previous section does not sustain the simple orientation / obscuration picture for seyfert type 1s and 2s , although it might be true for _ some _ of the seyfert 2s . here",
    "we suggest an alternative view that takes into account _ the time evolution of environmental and morphological properties of seyferts_. the failure to consider these factors in most seyfert environmental studies are likely to account for the discrepancies in their results : most of the criteria used in the search for companions favour close environments ( typically few times the diameter of the target galaxy ) , relatively bright companions and a particular interaction phase when the two systems are bound but not yet merged .",
    "moreover , environmental studies often are not coupled to morphological examination and thus might be missing ( i ) faint tidal features that indicate an evolved merger , or tidal perturbations due to a faint companion ( or a companion lying outside the maximum search radius ) ( ii ) bars and rings that suggest perturbation by smaller companions or at earlier epochs ( iii ) central elongations and even faint secondary nuclei that indicate a recent merger .",
    "numerical simulations have indeed shown that the minimum interaction strength needed to trigger disk instabilities can be reached ( i ) during the perigalactic passage of very small companions , ( ii ) by larger companions at greater distances ( @xmath2530@xmath10 or more ) , or ( iii ) in massive hyperbolic encounters where shortly after perigalacticon , @xmath2510@xmath48yr(@xcite ) , the companion reaches large distances . at perigalacticon ,",
    "tidal distortions are triggered that are quickly amplified by disk self - gravity into bar or spiral instabilities . in these cases",
    "rapid gas inflow leads to an early episode of starburst or agn activity well before the galaxies merge ( within a few rotation periods ) . at this stage",
    "the galaxies have moved further apart and one can observe disk tidal distortions and perhaps an inner bar",
    ". this could be the case in several seyfert 2 galaxies in our sample , where strong tidal features and central bars are simultaneously observed .",
    "it is estimated that normal galaxies ( m@xmath2510@xmath56 ) can have 10 - 20% of their masses driven down to several 100 pc within @xmath3310@xmath48yr by an interaction .",
    "while the tidal triggering of disk instabilities with subsequent gas inflow is a short process , the bar formation leads to a continuous , low level nuclear feeding for much longer periods .",
    "seyferts at these stages might appear to reside in normal environments or be `` isolated '' .",
    "the life - time of this activity cycle ( that is the time needed for an agn to exhaust its fuel ) is comparable to the dynamical time scale of a galaxy ( of the order of 10@xmath48 yr , depending on the black hole luminosity ) and roughly that of the tidally induced bar of spiral ( @xmath2510@xmath49yr ) assuming gas inflow rates of @xmath250.5@xmath57yr@xmath58 ( @xcite ) .",
    "a latency period ( before material enters the nuclear regions ) of @xmath252@xmath4710@xmath48 yr ( depending on the galaxy mass ) precedes the bar phase .",
    "several additional factors may modify this scenario . a strong _ and",
    "_ centrally concentrated bulge would stabilize the disk against bar formation and thus prevent gas inflow until the final merging of the galaxies .",
    "moreover , prograde encounters are more likely to trigger gas inflow through a bar instability compared to retrograde encounters ( in fact the generally less spectacular tidal tails in ir - selected interacting galaxies compared to their optical counterparts , suggest a broad range of spin orientations as opposed to the prograde - prograde encounters in most optical pairs ) . consequently , these factors will also affect the level and life - time of nuclear activity .    once tidal distortions of the galactic disk have occurred and circumnuclear star formation is triggered , material loses angular momentum and falls further inwards .",
    "this has the effect of both feeding the agn and obscuring the broad line region : the galaxy appears as a seyfert 2 type . at this time , the contribution of the circumnuclear starburst to the luminosity output of the system might be larger than that of the hidden agn . later ,",
    "when dusty material is consumed in forming stars or is blown away by stellar winds we start seeing the blr and thus we classify the galaxy as seyfert 1 .",
    "the time interval to progress from seyfert 2 to seyfert 1 may coincide with the time interval for a small companion to merge via a double nucleus phase into an `` isolated '' host showing tidal appendages .",
    "the double nucleus systems are in fact short - lived and thus relatively rare phases to be observed .",
    "the estimated time before they coalesce into a single remnant is relatively short ( a few rotational periods ) and their inner regions will be relaxed in only @xmath2510@xmath48 yr , which is comparable ( or shorter ) to the seyfert activity lifetime . given the tendency for seyfert 1s to reside in early type hosts and our finding of a large fraction of them to reside in isolated systems showing tidal appendages emanating from a single nucleus , we suggest that these might be indeed recent merger products .    the phase corresponding to strong circumnuclear star formation triggered by the encounter would probably show up through warm 60 - 100 @xmath0 m and colder 25 - 60 @xmath0 m colours , within the scenario that we outlined in the previous section .",
    "this is not a well determined stage either , the star formation physics seems to be playing an important role in the strength and duration of the starburst phase .",
    "in fact , star formation and feedback seems to be one of the outstanding problems in trying to model the dynamical evolution of these systems .",
    "indeed it was recently shown through case studies of ulirgs that they can be in very different dynamical stages , although all associated with late stage mergers ; this indicates that there is no unique trigger for ulirg activity . in any case , as @xcite notes , since there exist ir - weak agns , the ir activity cycle must be shorter than the activity duty cycle ; furthermore the distinct location of the various galaxy groups in their `` ir - diagram '' indicates that the ir - luminosity decay must be happening very fast .",
    "( for the above outline we used several bibliographical references ; the most relevant are @xcite . ) in summary , we have seen that not only the gas content of the galaxy but also its internal structure , the orbital geometry of the encounter and the starburst physics are all important factors for determining the timing , duration and _ level _ of nuclear activity .",
    "based on the ideas described above we can now combine our earlier classification in terms of morphologies and interaction strength in a common sequence and plot the distribution of our three ( sub)samples along this sequence ( figure  [ f6 ] ) .",
    "this is by no means a unique description of the interaction process , given the several factors that affect the dynamical evolution of an encounter .",
    "however it is instructive for our ideas about the possible origins of the nuclear and ir activity to visualize the distribution of our samples through such a sequence .",
    "the logic we followed is simple :    objects with normal morphologies , either isolated ( ni ) or with companion galaxies ( nc ) but no morphological indication of interactions are put together in the beginning of this sequence",
    ". these might be objects that suffered a past encounter either too weak or too long ago to affect significantly their morphologies , but enough to trigger nuclear activity .",
    "then , the purely barred / ringed systems in isolated ( bi ) or systems with companions ( bc ) are grouped together .",
    "it is not clear where in the time evolution of the encounter these cases belong .",
    "they might be representing low level interactions because of distant companions or / and subsequent phases after perigalacticon passage , bar formation and nuclear activation .    right after",
    ", we have the strongly interacting systems , either with ( sb ) or without ( s ) a bar / ring formation .",
    "these must be representing the phases at or shortly after perigalacticon , where starburst and subsequent nuclear activation occur .",
    "as these systems evolve in time , the companion separation increases but they show bars / rings and strong tidal features ( tc or btc ) .    the final stage we try to depict is the coalescence stage where either the two nuclei are still visible within a common body ( mg ) or only a tidal appendage emanates from a single nucleus , isolated galaxy ( ti ) .    for the case denoted ( bti ) , an isolated object with a bar structure and a tidal feature , it is not clear whether it belongs here or to some other stage . we have observed only one seyfert 2 in this stage and perhaps it belongs to the ( btc ) phase but the companion galaxy is too faint or is farther than our search radius .",
    "as expected from the earlier discussion of our results , the three ( sub)samples show markedly different distributions ( figure  [ f6 ] ) :    \\(i ) the seyfert 1 galaxies show a bimodal distribution peaking at normal morphologies and advanced mergers , that is , the late stages of the interaction process according to our definition ; there is a remarkable avoidance of the peak interaction phases or the ones right after perigalacticon .",
    "there are however a few observed cases of strongly interacting seyfert 1s .",
    "how are we supposed to understand them ? as we already pointed , the evolutionary sequence we claim between the seyfert 1 and 2 types is not one - fold ( time ) but depends as well on the physical properties ( dust content ) of the host galaxy and maybe also on the interaction parameters ( how much material and how fast is driven inwards ) .",
    "\\(ii ) the strong interaction phase represents precisely the peak in the distribution of seyfert 2s in figure  [ f6 ] , followed by a slow fall - off in particular towards the double nucleus mergers .",
    "the least probable occurrence of seyfert 2s is in the isolated plus tidal or bar / ring phases , because we think at those stages the galaxy is observed as seyfert 1 .",
    "\\(iii ) 33% of the seyfert 2s occur in the sequence with normal morphologies ( ni+nc ) ; this is similar to the seyfert 1 fraction in these classes ( 38% ) .",
    "these reside in hosts with a wide range of environments .",
    "they have comparable @xmath30 and in general a similar ( large ) range in optical and ir luminosities .",
    "we have also mentioned throughout this paper the bimodality in some of the properties of seyfert 2s .",
    "we are thus lead to the conclusion that these might indeed be `` unified '' with seyfert 1s within the context of the orientation unification model .",
    "\\(iv ) the cold sample objects show a narrow distribution in figure  [ f6 ] , confined within the disruptive phases of the encounters .",
    "it is actually remarkable that after excluding the seyfert 2s with normal morphologies ( which we `` unified '' with seyfert 1s ) the cold and warm seyfert 2 distributions are very similar .",
    "_ we are thus led to the conclusion that this diagram represents primarily an evolutionary sequence from bottom to top_.",
    "we confirm that nuclear activity is linked to galactic interactions .      \\1 .",
    "warm seyfert types 1 and 2 differ in two fundamental ways : time evolution and nuclear obscuration .",
    "strongly interacting seyfert 2s are in an earlier interaction stage than seyfert 1s",
    ". seyfert 2s with normal morphologies can be unified with the type 1s in the context of orientation / obscuration models .",
