    "undoped copper oxide la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 is an antiferromagnetic mott insulator , in which an electron correlation plays an important role @xcite .",
    "thus we may say that undoped cuprates are governed by mott physics . in 1986",
    "bednorz and mller discovered high temperature superconductivity in copper oxides by doping hole carriers into la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "their motivation was that higher @xmath0 could be achieved for copper oxide materials by combining jahn - teller ( jt ) active cu ions with the structural complexity of layer - type perovskite oxides . in order to investigate the mechanism of high temperature superconductivity",
    ", most of models assumed that the doped holes itinerate through the orbitals extended over a cuo@xmath3 plane in the systems consisting of the cuo@xmath4 octahedrons elongated by the jt effect .",
    "those models are called `` single - component theory '' , because the orbitals of hole carriers extend only over a cuo@xmath3 plane .    in 1989 , kamimura and his coworkers showed by first - principles calculations that the apical oxygen in the cuo@xmath4 octahedrons tend to approach towards cu@xmath5 ions , when sr@xmath5 ions are substituted for la@xmath6 ions in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 , in order to gain the attractive electrostatic energy in ionic crystals such as cuprates @xcite . as a result the elongated cuo@xmath4 by the jt effect shrink by doping holes .",
    "this deformation against the jt distortion is called `` anti - jahn - teller effect '' @xcite . by this effect",
    "the energy separation between the two kinds of orbital states which have been split originally by the jt effect becomes smaller by doping hole - carriers , where the spatial extension of one kind is parallel to the cuo@xmath3 plane while that of the other kind is perpendicular to it .    by taking account of the anti - jahn - teller effect kamimura and suwa",
    "proposed that one must consider these two kinds of orbital states equally in forming the metallic state of cuprates , and they constructed a metallic state coexisting with the local antiferromagnetic ( af ) order @xcite .",
    "this model is called `` kamimura - suwa ( k - s ) model '' @xcite .",
    "since `` anti - jahn - teller effect '' is a central issue of the jahn - teller physics , we may say that the k - s model bears important characteristics born from the interplay of jahn - teller physics and mott physics .",
    "since these two kinds of orbitals extend not only over the cuo@xmath3 plane but also along the direction perpendicular to it , the k - s model represents a prototype of `` two - component theory '' , in the contrast to the single - component theory .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss three important subjects emerged from the interplay of jahn - teller physics and mott physics , based on the k - s model .",
    "the first one is concerned with the shape of fermi surfaces in underdoped cuprates .",
    "the clarification of fermi surface structures is nowadays a central issue in underdoped cuprates .",
    "there are two views for fermi surfaces in cuprates .",
    "one view is based on the single - component theory , where a metallic state has a large fermi surface ( fs ) @xcite . since angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )",
    "experiments did not show the evidence of a large fs , the phenomenological idea of a pseudogap was introduced @xcite .",
    "an alternative view is based on the two - component theory developed by kamimura and suwa @xcite , and they have shown that the coexistence of a metallic state and local antiferromagnetic(af ) order results in the fermi pockets constructed by doped holes in the nodal region .",
    "this key - point of the k - s model results in the coexistence of superconductivity and the local af order below @xmath0 , as shown by kamimura and coworkers .",
    "the appearance of fermi pockets and small fermi surfaces in cuprates has been recently reported by various experimental groups @xcite .",
    "the second one is concerned with the phenomenological concept of pseudogap and the clarification of observed two - gaps - structure in arpes spectra in the underdoped regime .",
    "based on the electronic structure calculated from the k - s model @xcite , we will show that the angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) spectra in cuprates below @xmath0 exhibit a peculiar feature consisting of a coherent peak due to the superconducting density of states at the nodal region and the real transitions of electrons from the occupied states below the fermi level to a free - electron state above the vacuum level in the antinodal region .",
    "since the latter transitions reflect the density of states ( dos ) of the highest energy band for the doped holes , these transitions may appear as a broad hump with a small peak . in this context",
    "it will be concluded that the pseudogap in the underdoped regime is absent , based on the k - s model .    concerning the arpes experiments in underdoped cuprates , tanaka and his coworkers reported very interesting gap features in the observation of arpes spectra .",
    "their result exhibits a coherent peak in the nodal region and a broad hump in the antinodal region in underdoped bi2212 samples below @xmath7@xcite . from the quantitative agreement between theory and experiment",
    "we will conclude that the observed broad hump corresponds to the photo - electron excitations from the occupied states below the fermi level to the free electron state above the vacuum level and thus the idea of a pseudogap in underdoped cuprates is no longer necessary .",
    "the third subject is the finite size effect of a metallic state in the k - s model on the spin - electronic structures of underdoped cuprates . in connection with the observed finite size of a spin - correlated region of the af order @xcite , hamada and his coworkers @xcite and",
    "kamimura and hamada @xcite determined the ground state of the k - s model in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) square lattice system with 16 ( 4 @xmath8 4 ) localized spins by the exact diagonalization method , and they clarified that , in the presence of hole - carriers , the localized spins in a spin - correlated region tend to form an af order rather than a random spin - singlet state and thus that the hole - carriers can lower the kinetic energy of itineration in the spin - correlated region by taking the two kinds of orbitals alternately in the lattice of af order . this mechanism of lowering the kinetic energy of the hole - carriers has led to the coexistence of a metallic state and the local af order .",
    "this is the essential key - point of the k - s model .",
    "we call the above - mentioned behavior of a doped hole `` the mechanism of the k - s model '' . in this paper we will suggest a possibility that a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of fermi - pocket - states and of large - fermi - surface states may appear due to the finite size effect when a temperature is higher than @xmath0 .",
    "finally a new phase diagram for underdoped cuprates is proposed .",
    "the organization of the present paper is the following : it consists of six parts . after introduction , at the beginning of the section ii we will first describe the essential features of the k - s model which bears important characteristics born from the interplay of jahn - teller physics and mott physics",
    ". then we will show from the calculated many - body - effects included energy bands that the key features of the fermi surfaces in underdoped cuprates are fermi pockets .",
    "further we will show that the `` fermi arcs '' observed in arpes is not a portion of a large fermi surface , but it should be one of the edges of fermi pockets in the nodal region .",
    "in section iii , on the basis of the many - body - effects included energy bands obtained from the k - s model we will predict the key features of arpes spectra and clarify the origin of the two - gap scenario proposed from the experimental results by tanaka _ et al _ @xcite . in section iv we will discuss the finite size effects on the fermi surfaces in cuprates , because a metallic state in the k - s model coexists with local antiferromagnetic ( af ) order constructed from the localized spins whose spin - correlation length is finite . in connection with the finite size effects",
    "we will discuss a possibility of spatially inhomogeneous distribution of fermi - pocket - states and of large - fermi - surface states .",
    "taking account of the finite size effect , a new phase diagram is proposed in section v. section vi is devoted to conclusion and concluding remarks .",
    "in this section we will first describe the electronic structure of a metallic state in underdoped lsco calculated by kamimura and suwa@xcite , emphasizing the important roles due to the interplay of jahnteller physics and mott physics .",
    "figure 1 shows the energy - level landscape starting from the orbitally doubly - degenerate e@xmath9 and triply - degenerate t@xmath10 states of a cu@xmath5 ion in a cuo@xmath4 octahedron with octahedral symmetry embedded in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 at the left column . by the jt effect the cu e@xmath9 orbital state splits into a@xmath11 and b@xmath11 orbital states , which form antibonding and bonding molecular orbitals of a@xmath11 and b@xmath11 symmetry with the molecular orbitals constructed from the in - plane oxygen p@xmath12 and apical oxygen p@xmath13 orbitals in a cuo@xmath4 octahedron with tetragonal symmetry , respectively .",

    ", we introduce the hubbard @xmath18 interaction ( @xmath19ev ) as a strong electron - correlation effect .",
    "then the half - filled b@xmath15 state splits into the lower and upper hubbard bands denoted by l.h . and u.h . in the figure .",
    "the localized electrons in the l.h . band give rise to the localized spins around the cu sites .",

    "theoretically it was shown by the first - principles variational calculations of the spin - density - functional approach @xcite that the optimized distance between apical o and cu in la@xmath21sr@xmath22cuo@xmath2 ( lsco ) which minimizes the total energy of lsco decreases with increasing sr concentration . as a result the elongated cuo@xmath4 octahedrons by the jahn - teller ( jt ) interactions shrink by doping holes .",
    "this shrinking effect against the jahn - teller distortion is the `` anti - jahn - teller effect '' @xcite , as already explained in introduction .",
    "by this anti - jahn - teller effect , the energy separation between the two kinds of orbital states which have been split originally by the jt effect becomes smaller .",
    "these two states are the a@xmath11 anti - bonding orbital state @xmath23 and the @xmath24 bonding orbital state @xmath25 shown in the third column from the left in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . here",
    "the a@xmath14 anti - bonding orbital state is constructed by cu d@xmath26 orbital and six surrounding oxygen p orbitals including apical o p@xmath13-orbitals while @xmath25 orbital consists of four in - plane o p@xmath12 orbitals with a small cu d@xmath17 component parallel to a cuo@xmath1 plane .",

    "this means that an electron is taken out from the system shown in fig .",
    "hereafter we consider a hole as a doped carrier instead of the electron picture . in this case , there appear two kinds of many - particle states called multiplets .",
    "one case is that a dopant hole occupies an antibonding a@xmath14 orbital . in this case",
    "its spin becomes parallel to a localized spin in the b@xmath15 orbital to get a spin - triplet state , because the hund s coupling makes the spins of holes in a@xmath27 and b@xmath15 orbitals with different symmetry parallel . as a result the energy of the a@xmath14 orbital state for a single hole decreases by the hund s coupling energy of 0.5 ev .",
    "thus this spin - triplet multiplet is called the `` hund s coupling triplet '' denoted by @xmath30b@xmath11 , which is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]*a*.    the other case is that a dopant hole occupies a bonding b@xmath11 orbital , and its spin becomes antiparallel to the localized spin in the antibonding b@xmath15 orbital , since the dopant and localized holes occupy the orbitals of the same symmetry . as a result the energy of b@xmath11 orbital state for a single hole decreases by the spin - singlet exchange interaction of 3.0 ev .",
    "this spin - singlet multiplet may correspond to the `` zhang - rice singlet '' in the t - j model @xcite , and it is denoted by @xmath31a@xmath11 .",
    "zhang - rice singlet state is schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]*b*.    the energy separation between the two kinds of orbital states , the a@xmath14 anti - bonding orbital state and the b@xmath11 bonding orbital state , becomes smaller by the anti - jahn - teller effect when the hole concentration increases in the underdoped regime .",
    "thus the hund s coupling triplet state and the zhang - rice singlet state also appear at nearly the same energy in the underdoped region .    by the first - principles cluster calculations which take into account the madelung potential due to all the ions surrounding a cuo@xmath4 cluster in lsco and also the anti - jahn - teller effect , kamimura and eto showed that the lowest - state energies of these two multiplets are nearly equal when both the hund s coupling exchange interaction and the spin - singlet exchange interaction are included @xcite .",
    "consequently the energy difference between the highest occupied orbital states a@xmath14 in @xmath30b@xmath11 multiplet and b@xmath11 in @xmath31a@xmath11 multiplet becomes only 0.1ev for the optimum doping ( @xmath32 ) in la@xmath21sr@xmath33cuo@xmath34 , as will be shown in the subsection d.     schematic pictures of hund s coupling triplet @xmath30b@xmath11 ( * a * ) and zhang - rice singlet @xmath31a@xmath11 ( * b * ) .",
    "the long and short arrows represent the spins of localized and doped holes , respectively.,width=340 ]      by using the results of the first - principles cluster calculations for the lowest state of cuo@xmath4 octahedron in lsco by kamimura and eto mentioned in a previous subsection and assuming that the localized spins form an af order by the superexchange interaction via intervening oxygen ions , kamimura and suwa @xcite constructed a metallic state of lsco for its underdoped regime . since this model has already been explained in detail in refs .",
    "6 and 7 , here we explain the key - features of the model in a heuristic way using the picture of a two - story house model shown in fig.[fig4 ] . in this figure",
    "the first story of a cu house with ( yellow ) roof is occupied by the cu localized spins , which form the af order in the spin - correlated region by the superexchange interaction .",
    "the second story in a cu house consists of two floors due to the anti - jt effect , lower a@xmath14 floor and upper b@xmath11 floor .",
    "the second story between neighboring cu houses are connected by oxygen rooms with ( blue - color ) roof , reflecting the hybridization of cu d and o p orbitals . in the second story",
    "a hole - carrier with up spin enters into the a@xmath14 floor at the left - hand cu house due to hund s coupling with cu localized up - spin in the first story ( hund s coupling triplet ) , as shown in the extreme left column of the figure . by the transfer interaction marked by a long ( red - color ) arrow in the figure ,",
    "the hole is transferred into the b@xmath11 floor at the neighboring cu house ( the second from the left ) through the oxygen room , where the hole with up spin forms a spin - singlet state with a localized down spin at the second cu house from the left ( zhang - rice singlet ) .",
    "the key feature of the k - s model is that the hole - carriers in the underdoped regime of lsco form a metallic state , by taking the hund s coupling triplet and the zhang - rice singlet alternately in the presence of the local af order without destroying the af order , as shown in the figure .",
    "since the second story consists of the two floors of different symmetry , the two - story house model represents the two - component theory . as seen in fig.[fig4 ]",
    ", the characteristic feature of the k - s model is the coexistence of the af order and a normal , metallic ( or a superconducting ) state in the underdoped regime .",
    "this feature in the k - s model ( two - component theory ) is different from that of the single - component theory .",
    "explanation of the k - s model by the picture of a two - story house model , width=340 ]      the following effective hamiltonian is introduced in order to describe the `` k - s model '' following kamimura and suwa @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "it consists of four parts : the one - electron hamiltonian @xmath35 for a@xmath36 and b@xmath11 orbital states , the transfer interaction between neighboring cuo@xmath37 octahedrons @xmath38 , the superexchange interaction between the cu @xmath39 localized spins @xmath40 , and the exchange interactions between the spins of dopant holes and of @xmath39 localized holes within the same cuo@xmath37 octahedron @xmath41 .",
    "thus we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 a@xmath36 or b@xmath11 ) represents the one - electron energy of the a@xmath36 and b@xmath11 orbital states , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the creation and annihilation operators of a dopant hole with spin @xmath47 in the @xmath48-th cuo@xmath37 octahedron , respectively , @xmath49 the transfer integrals of a dopant hole between @xmath50-type and @xmath51-type orbitals of neighboring cuo@xmath37 octahedrons , @xmath52 the superexchange interaction between the spins @xmath53 and @xmath54 of @xmath39 localized holes in the b@xmath36 orbital at the nearest neighbor cu sites @xmath48 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 for af interaction ) , and @xmath57 the exchange integrals for the exchange interactions between the spin of a dopant hole @xmath58 and the @xmath39 localized spin @xmath53 in the @xmath48-th cuo@xmath37 octahedron .",
    "there are two exchange constants , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , for the hund s coupling triplet and zhang - rice singlet , respectively , where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the appearance of the two kinds of exchange interactions in the fourth term is the key - feature of the k - s model .    by replacing the localized spins @xmath53 s in @xmath41 by their average value @xmath63 in the mean - field sense",
    ", we can calculate the change of the total energy upon moving of a hole from an a@xmath14 orbital state in the hund s coupling spin - triplet at cu site @xmath48 to an empty b@xmath11 orbital state in the zhang - rice spin - singlet at the neighbouring cu site @xmath55 . at the first step the hole moves from cu site @xmath48 to infinity .",
    "the change of the total energy in the mean field approximation is equal to @xmath64 . at the second step the hole moves from infinity to an empty b@xmath11 orbital state at cu site @xmath55 to form the zhang - rice singlet .",
    "the change of the total energy in the second step is equal to @xmath65 . as a result",
    "the change of the total energy by the transfer of the hole from the occupied @xmath66 orbital state at cu site @xmath48 to the empty @xmath67 orbital state at cu site @xmath55 is @xmath68    here @xmath69 and @xmath70 represents the effective one electron energy of a@xmath36 and b@xmath11 orbital states including the exchange interaction term @xmath71 , respectively .",

    "the energy difference of the one - electron energies between a@xmath36 and b@xmath11 orbital states in a cuo@xmath4 octahedron for a certain value of @xmath81 has been determined so as to reproduce the difference of the lowest state energies between the hund s coupling spin - triplet state and the zhang - rice spin - singlet state for the same value of @xmath81 in lsco calculated by the mcscf cluster calculations which includes the anti - jt - effect @xcite .",
    "thus the calculated value of @xmath69 - @xmath70 is 0.1 ev for the case of the optimum doping ( @xmath32 ) .",

    "@xcite means the region around the @xmath116 point in the present paper , their suggestion is different from our theoretical results .",
    "finally we should remark that any proposed theory must explain both the doping and temperature dependences of arpes spectra in the underdoped regime consistently . from this standpoint",
    "we will investigate the temperature dependence of the arpes spectra theoretically in the next subsection .",
    "for the purpose of calculating the temperature dependence of the `` antinodal transition energy '' , first of all we would like to clarify the physical meaning of @xmath112 .",
    "when a hole concentration @xmath81 is fixed at a certain value in the underdoped region and temperature increases beyond @xmath0 , at a certain temperature in the normal phase the local af order constructed by superexchange interaction in a cuo@xmath1 plane becomes destroyed thermally and thus the coexistence of a metallic state with the fermi pockets and of the local af order will disappear . as a result",
    "the k - s model will not hold at that temperature in the underdoped regime .",
    "this temperature is defined as @xmath112 .",
    "thus the phase of the fermi pockets coexisting with the local af order in the k - s model holds only below @xmath112 .",
    "we designate the phase of the fermi pockets as the `` small fermi - surface ( fs ) '' phase .",
    "hereafter it is abbreviated as the sf - phase . when temperature increases beyond @xmath112 , a system changes from the sf - phase to the electronic phase consisting of a large fs without the af order .",
    "we call this phase the large fs - phase , abbreviated as the lf - phase .      on the other hand , the physical meaning of @xmath136 can be explained in the following way : when the hole concentration exceeds the optimum doping ( @xmath81 = 0.15 ) for lsco and enters a slightly overdoped region , the local af order via superexchange interaction in a cuo@xmath1 plane begins to be destroyed by an excess of hole - carriers .",
    "thus the k - s model does not hold at a certain concentration @xmath102 in the overdoped region , and hence the small fs in the k - s model changes to a large fs .",
    "thus @xmath112 vanishes at @xmath102 . from the analysis of various experimental results we choose @xmath102 = 0.17 for lsco @xcite . from this explanation",
    "we can say that the area below @xmath112 in the underdoped regime represents the region in which the normal , metallic phase above @xmath0 and the superconducting phase below @xmath0 coexist with the local af order .    in this circumstance",
    "it is clear that the `` antinodal transition energy '' defined by @xmath137 appears at temperatures below @xmath101 and vanishes at @xmath101 .",
    "now we calculate the temperature dependence of the antinodal transition energy by using equations ( [ eq1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq3a ] ) and ( [ eq3b ] ) .",
    "the calculated results for three concentrations @xmath81 = 0.05 , 0.10 and 0.15 of lsco in the underdoped to optimum - doped region are shown in fig .  [ fig11]*c * as a function of temperature , where the parameter @xmath138 = 300k is used . as seen in the figure , the antinodal transition energy increases slightly with temperature up to @xmath101 and vanished sharply at @xmath101 .",
    "these calculated results are compared with experimental results of underdoped sample of bi2212 in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , which are indicated by triangle and square , respectively , in fig .",
    "[ fig11]*c*. as seen in the figure , the agreement between theory and experiment is remarkably good .",
    "according to the results of neutron inelastic scattering experiments by mason @xcite and yamada @xcite , the af spin - correlation length @xmath139 in the underdoped region of lsco is finite . in the underdoped regime of lsco",
    "it increases as the sr concentration increases from @xmath140 in lsco , the onset of superconductivity , and reaches a value of about 50  or more at the optimum doping ( @xmath32 ) . in this subsection",
    "we discuss the effects of the finite size of the af spin - correlation length on the structure of fermi pockets shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . according to the k - s model in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , in the spin - correlated region a doped hole in the underdoped regime of lsco can itinerate coherently by taking the a@xmath14 and b@xmath11 orbitals alternately in the presence of the local af order without destroying the af order .    in the case of a finite spin - correlated region , one may think that there exist the frustrated spins on the boundary between the spin - correlated region of the af order and the region of the `` resonating valence bond '' ( rvb ) state proposed by anderson @xcite . here",
    "the frustrated spins mean that the localized spins on the boundary are not in the af order , but directed parallel to each other .",
    "suppose that one of frustrated spins of a parallel direction on the boundary has changed its direction from parallel to antiparallel by the fluctuation effect in the 2d heisenberg af spin system during the time of @xmath141 defined by @xmath142 , where @xmath52 is the superexchange interaction ( @xmath1430.1 ev ) . in the time of @xmath141 ,",
    "on the other hand , the hole - carriers at the fermi level can move with the fermi velocity inside the spin - correlated region of the af order .",
    "the traveling time of a doped hole at the fermi level over an area of the spin - correlation length is given by @xmath144 , where @xmath145 is the fermi velocity of a doped hole at the fermi level . in the case of underdoped lsco , @xmath141 is 6 @xmath8 @xmath146 sec . since @xmath145 is estimated to be 2.4 @xmath8 @xmath147 m / sec from the dispersion of the # 1 band in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , @xmath148 is 2 @xmath8 @xmath149 sec for the underdoped region of @xmath150 to @xmath92 in lsco , where for the spin - correlation length @xmath139 at @xmath32 , we have chosen 50 .",
    "thus @xmath148 becomes much longer than @xmath141 . as a result the frustrated spins on the boundary change their directions from parallel to antiparallel before a hole - carrier in the spin - correlated region of the af order reaches the boundary .",
    "thus a metallic state for a doped hole becomes much wider than the observed spin - correlation length by its passing through the boundary with the mechanism of the k - s model .       a special case in which a doped hole reaches site 1 on the boundary and at the same time one of the frustrated spins with up direction at site 2 on the boundary changes its direction from up to down .",
    "( * a * ) the doped hole with up spin reached site 1 occupies the a@xmath14 orbital , where the localized spin at site 2 changes its direction from up to down .",

    ", in the presence of hole - carriers , the localized spins in a spin - correlated region tend to form an af order rather than a random spin - singlet state and thus that the hole - carriers can lower the kinetic energy by itinerating in the lattice of af order with the mechanism of the k - s model . in this way they have proved that the coexistence of the metallic state and af order makes the kinetic energy of hole - carriers lower so that such coexistence state corresponds to the lowest energy state in the k - s model .",
    "thus generally , a hole - carrier in the spin - correlated region of the af order can propagate through the boundary of the spin - correlated region with the mechanism of the k - s model and hence a region of a metallic state coexisting with the af order becomes much wider than the observed spin - correlated region .",
    "recently an idea similar to ours with regard to the lowering of the kinetic energy has been proposed by wrobel and coworkers who have shown that the lowering of the kinetic energy is the driving mechanism to give rise to superconductivity @xcite .    as a special case of destroying the coexistence of a metallic state and the local af order on the boundary ,",
    "let us consider a case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where a doped hole with up - spin reaches site 1 on a boundary when one of the frustrated spins with up direction at site 2 is about to change its direction from up to down . here",
    "the localized spins inside the boundary form the af order while those outside the boundary take the rvb state , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where the rvb state consists of the nearest neighbor spin - singlet pairs ( @xmath151 ) , allowing the singlet pairs to move .",
    "thus the doped hole with up spin at site 1 can move to site 2 by occupying the b@xmath11 orbital . as a result it forms the zhang - rice singlet with a localized down spin at site 2 . in this case",
    "the doped hole with up spin in the zhang - rice singlet can not move to a@xmath14 orbital state at site 3 because the localized spins at site 3 take the rvb state .",
    "thus the coherent motion of a hole - carrier by taking the a@xmath14 and b@xmath11 orbitals in the presence of the local af order without destroying the af order stops at this moment .    instead of",
    "it the zhang - rice singlet moves from site 2 to site 3 and to further sites in the region of the rvb states like a quasi - particle in the t - j model @xcite , until a certain region of the rvb state changes to the lower energy state of the local af order to create the coexistence state of a metallic state and the local af order again .",
    "thus we can say that an spatially inhomogeneous distribution of fermi - pocket - states and of large - fermi - surface - states appears as the finite size effect when a temperature is higher than @xmath0 , and such distribution may change with time .",
    "our prediction with regard to the coexistence of fermi - pocket - states and of large - fermi - surface - states above @xmath0 is consistent with the experimental results by meng _",
    "et al _ @xcite who recently reported the coexistence of fermi pockets and a large fermi surface in bi@xmath1sr@xmath21la@xmath22cuo@xmath91 ( la - bi2201 ) which has a similar structure to lsco with regard to the array of cuo@xmath4 octahedrons .",
    "however , when temperature becomes below @xmath0 , the regions of the coexistence of a superconducting state and the local af order becomes dominant , because the energy of such coexistence state is lower than that of the hole - carriers in the rvb state , according to hamada and his coworkers @xcite .",
    "from the calculated results shown in fig .  [ fig11]*a to c * , we can construct the @xmath152 vs @xmath81 phase diagram for lsco by choosing @xmath101 as a phase boundary , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] . in this phase diagram",
    "we have clarified the physical meaning of each area : there is no longer a pseudogap phase . below @xmath101 in the underdoped region",
    "the sf phase constructed from the fermi pockets appears under the coexistence of the local af order .",
    "however , owing to various effects such as the mixing effects of the sf and lf phases due to temperature , hole - concentration and the finite size effect of a metallic state , each new phase is not sharply defined so that we have used a word `` oriented '' . for example , we have pointed out a possibility of the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of fermi - pocket - states and of large - fermi - surface - states above @xmath0 . in such a way",
    "the lf - phase may be mixed into the sf - phase spatially and/or thermally even below @xmath101 .",
    "thus , when temperature increases at a certain hole concentration in the underdoped region , the shape of a fermi pocket changes to a large fermi surface gradually with increasing temperature . this fact can explain the strange temperature - evolution of a fermi arc observed by norman _",
    "et al _ @xcite and kanigel _ et al _ @xcite without introducing the pseudogap .",

    "thus we call that ares `` d - wave oriented superconducting phase '' . such mixing effect",
    "was experimentally reported by mller @xcite .",
    "thus it is better to say that @xmath101 represents a crossover from the sf - phase to the lf - phase rather than a phase boundary .     a new phase diagram for lsco , width=340 ]",
    "further we can predict that the spin susceptibility shows the 2d - like antiferromagnetic features mainly below @xmath101 while the pauli - like temperature - dependent behavior above @xmath101 .",
    "we find that this prediction is also consistent with the experimental results for lsco @xcite . in this context",
    "it should be emphasized that the k - s model is shown to explain successfully not only the arpes experimental results @xcite but also a number of other experimental results such as nmr results showing the coexistence of a superconducting state and antiferromagnetic order @xcite , polarized x - ray absorption spectra @xcite , site - specific x - ray absorption spectroscopy @xcite , anomalous electronic entropy @xcite , d - wave superconductivity @xcite , etc . , without introducing adjustable parameters .",
    "theoretically the k - s model is also supported by lda + u band calculations @xcite , as already mentioned in section iie .",
    "in this paper we have shown on the basis of the k - s model how the interplay of mott physics and jahn - teller physics plays an important role in determining the superconducting as well as the metallic state of underdoped cuprates .",
    "it was pointed out for underdoped cuprates that mott physics gives rises to the existence of local antiferromagnetic order due to the localized spins while that the anti - jahn - teller effect as a central issue of jahn - teller physics creates the existence of two kinds of orbitals parallel and perpendicular to a cuo@xmath1 plane which are energetically nearby .",
    "the k - s model which bears important characteristics born from the interplay of jahn - teller physics and mott physics has led to the coexistence of the local af order and a metallic states above @xmath0 .",
    "this coexistence has resulted in the occurrence of fermi pockets . further below @xmath0",
    "the superconductivity and antiferromagnetism coexist , leading to the appearance of d - wave superconductivity even in the phonon - involved mechanism , as was shown by kamimura , matsuno , suwa and ushio @xcite .    in connection with the interplay of jahn - teller physics and mott physics ,",
    "the following important results have been obtained in this paper : it has been clarified on the basis of the k - s model that a concept of pseudogap discussed theoretically @xcite and reported by arpes , stm and tunneling experiments below @xmath101 in underdoped cuprates @xcite is not necessary .",
    "we have shown that the strange phenomena observed in the antinodal region are explained by the real transitions of photo - excited electrons from the occupied states in the highest conduction band in the antinodal region to a free - electron state above the vacuum level . in this context",
    "we conclude that the concept of the pseudogap in the underdoped cuprates is no longer necessary .",
    "further the physical meaning of the @xmath100 is not related to the pseudogap but it represents a crossover line from the phase consisting mainly of the fermi pockets in the normal state to the phase consisting of a large fermi surface .    finally several remarks are made on the small fermi surface and the shadow bands in the underdoped regime of cuprates . in 1996",
    "wen and lee developed a slave - boson theory for the t - j model at finite doping , and showed that fermi pockets at low doping continuously evolved into the large fermi surface at high doping concentrations @xcite .",
    "although their theoretical model is different from the k - s model , it is interesting to find that they obtained a similar result to the prediction by the k - s model in 1994 with regard to the change from small fs to a large fs with increasing the hole concentration .",
    "recently a proposal was made to reconcile the experimental result of the coexistence of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity @xcite .",
    "further , in relation to the small fermi surface the idea of a shadow fermi surface was proposed as a replica of the main fermi surface transferred by @xmath153 by kampf and schrieffer theoretically @xcite and then by aebi _",
    "et al _ experimentally @xcite .",
    "checking the idea of the shadow fs experimentally , the observation of shadow bands in the arpes spectra have been reported @xcite .",
    "responding to the problems of shadow fs and shadow bands from the standpoint of the k - s model it should be emphasized that the fermi pockets in the metallic state calculated from the k - s model have been derived by the two - component theory as the result of the interplay of jahn - teller physics and mott physics and thus the origin of fermi pockets is different from that of a single - component theory .",
    "therefore , the fermi pockets shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] are neither the shadow fermi surface nor related to the shadow bands .",

    "<S> central issues in the electronic structure of underdoped cuprate superconductors are to clarify the shape of the fermi surfaces and the origin of a pseudogap . based on the model proposed by kamimura and suwa which bears important characteristics born from the interplay of jahn - teller physics and mott physics , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the feature of fermi surfaces is the fermi pockets constructed by doped holes under the coexistence of a metallic state and of the local antiferromagnetic order . below @xmath0 the holes on fermi pockets form cooper pairs with d - wave symmetry in the nodal region . in the antinodal region </S>",
    "<S> all the states below the fermi level are occupied by electrons so that there is no gap , not even pseudo both below and above @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> calculated angle - resolved photoemission spectrum below @xmath0 show a coherent peak at the nodal region while a broad hump in antinodal region . from this feature the origin of the two distinct gaps in observed arpes </S>",
    "<S> is elucidated . </S>",
    "<S> the finite - size - effects of a spin - correlation length coexisting with a metallic state are discussed . in particular , we discuss a possibility of the spatially inhomogeneous distribution of fermi - pocket - states and of large - fermi - surface - states above @xmath0 which changes with time . </S>",
    "<S> finally a new phase diagram for underdoped cuprates is proposed . </S>"
