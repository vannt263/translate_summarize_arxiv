    "the mystery of the dark matter in the universe remains unsolved . among",
    "the most plausible candidates are weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , of which the supersymmetric neutralino is a favourite candidate from the point of view of particle physics .",
    "the neutralino arises naturally in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , and has the attractive feature of giving a relic density which in large regions of parameter space is adequate to explain cosmological dark matter .",
    "we will in this paper consider the neutralino as a dark matter candidate within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) . for a thorough review of neutralino dark matter ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "neutralino dark matter can be and is searched for in several ways : directly through detection of nuclear recoils and/or ionization in direct detection experiments , and indirectly through searches for their annihilation products from annihilation in the earth or sun ( for neutrinos ) and the galactic halo . in this paper , we discuss the detection prospects of antiprotons from neutralino annihilation in the galactic halo .",
    "as antimatter seems not to exist in large quantities in the observable universe , including our own galaxy , any contribution to the cosmic ray generated antimatter flux ( besides antiprotons also positrons ) from exotic sources may in principle be a good signature for such sources . since neutralinos are constrained by supersymmetry to be majorana fermions they are their own antiparticles and therefore the final state in their annihilations in the halo will contain equal amounts of matter and antimatter ( given the particle physics constraints on cp violating couplings and in particular on baryon number violation ) . the excess of particles would drown in the background of particles from astrophysical sources , but there is a chance that antiparticles from this new primary source could be detectable .",
    "this issue has recently come into new focus thanks to upcoming space experiments like pamela ( @xcite ) and ams ( @xcite ) with increased sensitivity to the cosmic antimatter flux .",
    "cosmic ray induced secondary antiprotons are generated mainly through @xmath0 collisions of cosmic ray protons with interstellar matter . for kinematical reasons",
    "they are born with a non - zero momentum .",
    "the strategy to search for exotic signals has thus been to investigate the low - energy region since , e.g. , a neutralino - induced component does not drop as fast at low energies .",
    "however , as we will see , this ideal picture is blurred to a large extent by a ` tertiary ' component caused by scattering with energy loss of the secondary antiprotons .",
    "also , heavier nuclei in the interstellar medium target ( primarily helium ) cause a significant antiproton flux at low energy .",
    "in particular , it is known that in proton - nucleus collisions antiprotons may be produced well below the nominal @xmath1 energy threshold .",
    "in addition , low energy particles have difficulties entering the heliosphere which makes the connection of the measured fluxes to the insterstellar ones dependent on a not completely known correction due to this solar modulation ( which follows the 11-year solar cycle ) .    using reasonable parameters for the computation of all these effects",
    ", we will show that we are able to explain in a satisfactory way the present experimental data on cosmic ray antiprotons without the need of a primary component .",
    "this is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] , where our computed reference distribution for the background is compared to the recent data from the bess experiment ( bess 95 : @xcite ; bess 97 : @xcite ) . the satisfactory agreement can be compared to the conclusions of a recent analysis ( @xcite ) , where the need for an exotic component was more apparent .",
    "the main cause of this difference lies in our improved treatment of energy loss during propagation and our inclusion of the helium component of the interstellar medium . from fig .",
    "[ fig : back ] one can also see that the more recent bess data ( @xcite ) indicate a lower flux at low energy than earlier data .",
    "if reacceleration effects were included , the need for an exotic component would be even less .",
    "it is , however , also evident from fig.[fig : back ] that the statistical sample of antiprotons presently available is very limited , so that a new primary component can not yet be ruled out with high significance even if the propagation parameters were known . by varying all parameters in this complex astrophysical problem",
    ", the room for an exotic contribution can , as we will see , be made quite large , so it is certainly worthwhile to investigate what a favoured dark matter candidate like the mssm neutralino may yield in terms of a signal .",
    "it is apparent from fig.[fig : back ] that the low - energy tail of cosmic ray induced antiprotons does not fall very rapidly with decreasing kinetic energy , so this particular region of phase - space may not yield as a nice signature for a dark matter neutralino as previously thought .",
    "therefore , we will also discuss the cases ( mainly for high - mass neutralinos ) when the optimal kinetic energy for finding an exotic contribution is above several gev .",
    "unfortunately , it will turn out that the rates in that energy region are not large enough to cause a spectral distortion , unless the background of secondary antiprotons is considerably smaller and/or the signal is considerably larger than our canonical results show .",
    "this lack of spectral features in the neutralino - induced antiproton flux causes severe fundamental limitations for this indirect method of detecting supersymmetric dark matter .",
    "the idea of a dark matter - induced component in the cosmic antiproton spectrum has a long history .",
    "an early report ( @xcite ) of anomalous excess of cosmic ray antiprotons at low energies led to the suggestion that annihilation of relic neutralinos could be the source .",
    "calculations of fluxes have since then been performed with different degrees of sophistication , ranging from order of magnitude estimates ( @xcite ) , analytical expressions ( @xcite ) to results from monte - carlo simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the latter method has also been used together with @xmath2 production from neutralino annihilation in a minimal supergravity scheme ( @xcite ) .    in this work ,",
    "we use the lund monte carlo pythia 6.115 ( @xcite ) to simulate the energy spectrum of antiprotons from neutralino annihilation .",
    "we have used large numerical tables for our computations , but for convenience we also present useful parametrisations of the @xmath2 fluxes from various annihilation channels . in the following sections",
    ", we will describe the mssm model we use , describe the monte carlo simulations , discuss the antiproton propagation model , discuss the background fluxes and the uncertainties in both the background and the signal . finally , we will show and discuss our results .",
    "we work in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in general , the mssm has many free parameters , but with some reasonable assumptions we can reduce the number of parameters to the higgsino mass parameter @xmath3 , the gaugino mass parameter @xmath4 , the ratio of the higgs vacuum expectation values @xmath5 , the mass of the @xmath6-odd higgs boson @xmath7 ( or @xmath8 ) , the scalar mass parameter @xmath9 and the trilinear soft susy - breaking parameters @xmath10 and @xmath11 for the third generation . in particular , we do not impose any restrictions from supergravity other than gaugino mass unification , which relates the other gaugino mass parameter @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "( we remind that one of the most attractive features of the mssm is that , unlike the non - supersymmetric standard model , it is compatible with gauge coupling unification given the current data on the running of low - energy gauge couplings . ) for a more detailed definition of the parameters and a full set of feynman rules we refer to ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the lightest stable supersymmetric particle is in most models the lightest neutralino ( which we will henceforth just call ` the neutralino ' , @xmath14 ) , which is a superposition of the superpartners of the gauge and higgs fields , @xmath15 it is convenient to define the gaugino fraction of the neutralino , @xmath16 for the masses of the neutralinos and charginos we use the one - loop corrections from the literature ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and for the higgs boson masses we use the leading logarithmic two - loop radiative corrections , calculated within the effective potential approach given by @xcite .",
    ".the ranges of parameter values used in our scans of the mssm parameter space . note that several special scans aimed at interesting regions of the parameter space has been performed . in total",
    "we have generated approximately 116000 models which obey all accelerator constraints .",
    "of these , about 41000 have a relic density in the range @xmath17 .",

    "it is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the @xmath21 kinetic energy .",
    "for a given annihilation channel @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are , respectively , the branching ratio and the fragmentation function , and @xmath25 is the annihilation rate at @xmath26 ( which is very good approximation since the velocity of the neutralinos in the halo is so low ) . as dark matter neutralinos",
    "annihilate in pairs , the source function is proportional to the square of the neutralino number density @xmath27 . assuming that most of the dark matter in the galaxy is made up of neutralinos and that these are smoothly distributed in the halo",
    ", one can directly relate the neutralino number density to the dark matter density profile in the galactic halo @xmath28 . given a generic parametrization of @xmath28",
    ", we fix : @xmath29    ^{(\\beta-\\gamma)/\\alpha } \\label{eq : haloprof}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the value of the local halo density , @xmath31 is the galactocentric distance of the sun and @xmath32 is some length scale ; we assume @xmath33 and @xmath34 . in the actual computation",
    "we will mainly restrict ourselves to the case in which the dark matter density profile is described by a modified isothermal distribution , @xmath35 , mentioning what changes are expected in case more cuspy profiles , which are favoured by results in @xmath36-body simulations of hierarchical clustering , are considered .",
    "we will in particular consider the example of the navarro et al .",
    "profile ( @xcite ) , @xmath37 .",
    "although we are here focusing on the case of a smooth distribution of dark matter particles in the halo , an extension to a clumpy distribution is potentially interesting as well ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .    given the @xmath21 distributions calculated in the previous section , we can now get the source function for any given annihilation channel .",
    "in the absence of a well established theory to describe the interactions of charged particles with the magnetic field of the galaxy and the interstellar medium , the propagation of cosmic rays has generally been treated by postulating a semiempirical model and fitting the necessary set of unknown parameters to available data .",
    "a common approach is to use a diffusion approximation defined by a transport equation and an appropriate choice of boundary conditions  ( see e.g. @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .    in most diffusion models",
    "the form of the terms present in the diffusion equation is a compromise between physical insight and the possibility of an analytical solution .",
    "only recently more realistic models have been studied by applying numerical solutions  ( @xcite ) or monte carlo simulations  ( @xcite ) .",
    "our analysis is focused on comparing the characteristics of cosmic - ray antiproton signals of different origin : secondary antiprotons produced in cosmic - ray interactions and , eventually , a primary flux from neutralino annihilations .",
    "we want in particular to examine the dependence of the relative strength and spectral signatures on the diffusion model and the distribution of particle dark matter in the galactic halo .",
    "as both of them are not well constrained , we believe that an analytic solution of a reasonable physical model will be sufficient to provide most of the information needed on the behaviour of the two types of signals .",
    "we choose to describe the propagation of cosmic rays in the galaxy by a transport equation of the diffusion type as written by ginzburg and syrovatskii ( 1964 ) ( see also @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the case of a stationary solution , the number density @xmath36 of a stable cosmic ray species",
    "whose distribution of sources is defined by the function of energy and space @xmath38 , is given by : @xmath39 here and below we try to keep the notation as general as possible .",

    "it is a very good approximation to include in this term only the interactions with interstellar hydrogen ( on the other hand , we will point out below that heavier elements , in particular helium , can not be neglected when computing the source function for secondary antiprotons ) ; in this case @xmath43 is given by : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the hydrogen number density in the galaxy , @xmath46 is the velocity of the cosmic ray particle considered ` @xmath47 ' , while @xmath48 is the inelastic cross section for @xmath47-proton collisions . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) we have neglected continuous energy losses ; this will be included in an implicit form when considering secondary antiprotons .",
    "we will briefly mention in the conclusions the possibility that antiprotons have a finite lifetime @xmath49 . to take this effect into account",
    "the term @xmath50 should be added on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) , and this corresponds to shifting @xmath43 to @xmath51 in all the equations below .    we now have to specify the parameters introduced and the boundary conditions .",
    "we mainly follow the approach of @xcite , given also in @xcite and analogous to that of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the main feature is that the propagation region is assumed to have a cylindrical symmetry : the galaxy is split into two parts , a disk of radius @xmath52 and height @xmath53 , where most of the interstellar gas is confined , and a halo of height @xmath54 and the same radius .",
    "we assume that the diffusion coefficient is isotropic with possibly two different values in the disk and in the halo , reflecting the fact that in the disk there may be a larger random component of the magnetic fields .",
    "we then have a spatial dependence : @xmath55 regarding the rigidity dependence , fits to cosmic ray data in models which do not include reacceleration effects indicate that @xmath40 scales as @xmath56  ( @xcite ; @xcite ) with a cutoff below some rigidity @xmath57 .",
    "we consider the same functional form as in @xcite and @xcite : @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "we will briefly discuss below what changes are expected in case reacceleration is included , without making numerical predictions .",
    "the convective term has been introduced in eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff ] ) to describe the effect of particle motion against the wind of cosmic rays leaving the disk .",
    "we will therefore not consider any convection in the radial direction , assuming instead a galactic wind of velocity @xmath60 where @xmath61 an analytic solution is possible also in the case of a linearly increasing wind  ( @xcite ) .",
    "the last parameter we have to specify is the distribution of gas in the galaxy : for convenience we assume that this has the very simple z dependence @xmath62 where @xmath63 ( in practice we will take @xmath64 ) and an average in the radial direction is performed . finally , as we eventually want to treat the case of clumpy neutralino dark matter ( @xcite )",
    "we will not assume any symmetry in the source function @xmath65 ( note that to apply the results of this section to sources with a cylindrical symmetry , as for instance eq .",

    ", we will compare the flux of outgoing antiprotons with the one entering the diffusion region due to sources in ` free space ' . for references about other possible choices of boundary conditions",

    "( [ eq : halodiff ] ) corresponds to the number density found in @xcite and @xcite in the limits @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath97 and for a source function symmetric with respect to the z axis .    before applying these results to compute cosmic ray antiproton fluxes ,",
    "let us pause for a moment .",
    "most commonly , data on cosmic rays have been treated within the framework of the leaky box approximation .",
    "this is , to a certain extent , a simplified version of the diffusion model , where it is assumed that diffusion takes place rapidly .",
    "as was noticed for instance in @xcite , the path length distribution function of particles for a diffusion model with sources in the disk is very close to the exponential form characteristic of the leaky box treatment .",
    "for the purpose of computing secondary antiprotons , which are mainly generated in the gaseous disk , we expect it to be essentially equivalent to write a diffusion equation and fit its parameters to existing data on cosmic ray nuclei , or to derive from the same data in the simple leaky box scenario the grammage as a function of rigidity and use it to compute the secondary antiproton flux",
    ".    in this sense we do expect to find an antiproton secondary spectrum which is analogous to the results of several papers in which this has been calculated in the leaky box approximation ( except that in some of these papers not all the relevant effects have been included ) . on the other hand , in the case of neutralino sources which are more homogeneously distributed extending through the full halo ,",
    "it is unlikely that the effective average matter density particles have gone through can be of the same form as for sources located only in the disk .",
    "we will try to analyze in some detail this dependence on the geometry of the source , and we believe that this will give a real improvement with respect to the leaky box approximation .",
    "a further complication when comparing predictions of a theoretical model with data on cosmic rays taken at earth is given by the solar modulation effect . during their propagation from the interstellar medium through the solar system , charged particles",
    "are affected by the solar wind and tend to lose energy .",
    "the net result of the modulation is a shift in energy between the interstellar spectrum and the spectrum at the earth and a substantial depletion of particles with non - relativistic energies .",
    "the simplest way to describe the phenomenon is the analytical force - field approximation by gleeson & axford ( 1967 ; 1968 ) for a spherically symmetric model .",
    "the prescription of this effective treatment is that , given an interstellar flux at the heliospheric boundary , @xmath100 , the flux at the earth is related to this by @xmath101 where the energy at the heliospheric boundary is given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 and @xmath104 are the momenta at the earth and the heliospheric boundary respectively . here",
    "@xmath105 is the absolute value of the electron charge and @xmath106 the particle charge in units of @xmath105 ( e.g. @xmath107 for antiprotons ) .",
    "an alternative approach is to solve numerically the propagation equation of the spherically symmetric model  ( @xcite ) : the solar modulation parameter one has to introduce with this method roughly corresponds to @xmath108 as given above .",
    "when computing solar modulated antiproton fluxes , the two treatments seem not to be completely equivalent in the low energy regime ( the reader may check for instance fig .  4 in  ( @xcite ) against fig .  8 in  ( @xcite ) ) ; keeping this in mind , we will anyway implement the force field approximation , avoiding the problem of having to solve a partial differential equation for each of our supersymmetric models .",
    "we just mention here that the picture can be much more complicated : non - spherical propagation models which take into account the polarity of the solar magnetic field have been studied as well ( e.g.  @xcite ) . in this case",
    "the solar modulation effects on particles and antiparticles can be quite different .",
    "if one would translate this into the force field effective treatment , one should use different values for the modulation parameter for protons and antiprotons ( in contrast with the standard procedure of assigning to antiprotons the value found from proton flux measurements ) .",
    "the relation between these two would be very model dependent .    to compare with the two sets of bess measurements , which are both near solar minimum , we choose @xmath109  mv , in reasonable agreement with what the bess collaboration uses in their analysis .",
    "otherwise , we will focus on the interstellar fluxes which are not affected by these uncertainties .",
    "secondary antiprotons are produced in cosmic ray collisions with the interstellar gas .",
    "looking at the composition of incident and target particles it is easy to guess that the main contribution to the @xmath21 flux is given by cosmic ray protons colliding with interstellar hydrogen atoms . because of baryon number conservation ,",
    "the minimal @xmath110 reaction has three protons in the final state ; in the rest frame of the target hydrogen atom , the energy threshold for an incident proton to produce an antiproton is therefore @xmath111 . due to this feature , the energy distribution of the produced @xmath21 shows a sharp peak at a few gev and a steep fall - off at lower energies .",
    "it is reasonable to expect that in this low energy region reactions involving heavier nuclei , both as targets and projectiles , may play some role : they imply in fact different kinematics and the spectrum of the produced @xmath21 need not fall as fast as for low energy @xmath1 collisions .",
    "we have verified that the interaction of primary protons with interstellar helium is indeed a relevant process , while all others can be safely neglected as their contributions add up to below a few per cent of the total at any energy ( this is essentially the same conclusion as that of @xcite , although our approach is slightly different , as we will point out below ) .",
    "we assume therefore that the source function for secondary antiprotons has the following form ( the factor of 2 accounts for antiprotons produced by antineutron decays ) : @xmath112\\ , \\phi_p(\\vec{x},e^{\\prime})\\;. \\label{eq : source}\\ ] ] in this formula @xmath113 is the primary proton cosmic ray flux at the position @xmath114 in the galaxy and for the energy @xmath115 , @xmath116 is the helium number density which we assume to be @xmath117 of @xmath45 ( @xcite ) and have the same spatial dependence , while @xmath118 stands for the differential cross section for the production of an antiproton with energy @xmath119 for an incident proton of energy @xmath115 , in the two processes considered . for @xmath120 collisions",
    "we implement the standard parametrization for the differential cross section introduced in @xcite ; as already mentioned the energy threshold @xmath121 for this process is @xmath122 .",
    "a much smaller set of data is available in the case of antiproton production in proton collisions with heavier elements .",
    "in particular , it is difficult to estimate the effects of production below the nominal energy threshold for @xmath123 , which is known to occur in hadron - nucleus collisions .",
    "recently , several experiments have shown substantial sub - threshold @xmath2 production for deuterium , helium , carbon and copper targets ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "possible collective effects allow the abundant low - energy cosmic rays to produce antiprotons below threshold . on their way out of the nucleus , the produced antiprotons may also suffer inelastic losses which slow them down , creating a potentially important component in the low - energy cosmic ray - induced @xmath2 spectrum .",
    "( note that helium and heavier nuclei in the cosmic rays also give different kinematics for produced antiprotons .",
    "however , this gives an extra contribution at higher @xmath2 energies , and is therefore not important for our study . )",
    "these sub - threshold effects have been modeled by @xcite , where the limited data set available can be described by a transport equation solved by a monte carlo technique .    here",
    "we follow a much simplified approach , which describes the c and cu data displayed in @xcite reasonably well and which we apply to @xmath43 + he @xmath124 .",
    "we find that the collective effects can be mimicked by a shift in the incident proton energy : @xmath125 where @xmath121 is the nominal threshold ( @xmath126 ) for @xmath2 production in @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the energy loss due to inelastic rescattering can be approximated by decreasing the energy of the outgoing antiproton ( using @xmath1 kinematics ) by 1 gev .",
    "the yield of antiprotons per collision is taken to scale with the total @xmath127 cross section , parametrised according to @xcite . in this way",
    ", we have a parametrisation which is asymptotically correct at high energies and which also fits the subthreshold data .",
    "however , we are unable to assess the accuracy of this treatment for the problem at hand , believing it to be at the 50 % level , but acknowledging the need for improved data and theoretical modeling of this seldom discussed problem .      the last step to make before implementing eq .",
    "( [ eq : source ] ) is to determine the primary proton flux @xmath113 .",
    "the formalism introduced in section  [ sec : prop ] is suitable for this purpose once we specify the source function for primary protons .",
    "it is generally believed that supernova remnants are the main sources of cosmic rays .",
    "nevertheless the gradient of @xmath128 as a function of the distance from the galactic centre which is obtained from the observed distribution of supernovae or the related pulsar distribution is not consistent with models for gamma - ray emission ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "we take advantage of the phenomenological approach of @xcite , where a generic form for the radial distribution of cosmic - ray sources was considered and its parameters fitted to egret gamma - ray data ( eq .  (",
    "6 ) and fig .  12 in  @xcite ) .",
    "we therefore assume that the primary proton source , in cylindrical coordinates , is of the form : @xmath129 where @xmath130 kpc is our galactocentric distance , and we have assumed that the energy spectrum of emitted protons is the same everywhere in the galaxy .",
    "the function @xmath131 , which we may interpret as a normalization factor , can be rewritten , after propagation , in terms of the local proton flux @xmath132 which has been measured in several experiments .",
    "it was argued in the past that the spread among different experimental determinations of @xmath132 introduces one of the main factors of uncertainty in the prediction for the secondary antiproton flux ( see for instance  @xcite ) .",
    "the recent measurements by the imax  ( @xcite ) and caprice ( @xcite ) collaborations are in better agreement with each other . in @xcite ,",
    "a fit of the data of these two experiments with a single power law in energy or rigidity was made , using the force - field method to take solar modulation into account .",
    "the fits in rigidity ( see also  @xcite ) show a steeper fall - off than those in energy ; however , this may not be the case if a break in the spectrum at low rigidities is assumed instead  ( @xcite ) .",

    "we will not combine the uncertainty bands we have just derived and make a definite statement about the uncertainty on the prediction of the cosmic antiproton background . to be able to do that on a firmer basis we should compare the predictions of our propagation model directly against the whole set of data on cosmic ray nuclei and this is beyond the aim of the paper .",
    "we stress again that this section was mainly intended to show that the most recent data on cosmic ray antiprotons can be fitted by the background flux for some natural choice of the diffusion parameters .",
    "on the other hand we find that the prediction for the background could be lower as well , leaving room for an antiproton flux generated by an exotic source , possibly dark matter neutralinos .",
    "it seems very plausible that cosmic rays are reaccelerated by a fermi type of acceleration by stochastic magnetic fields during propagation .",
    "this has been treated , e.g. ,  in seo & ptuskin ( 1994 ) ; heinbach & simon ( 1995 ) and simon & heinbach ( 1996 ) .",
    "there is also a possibility that cosmic rays get reaccelerated by weak shock waves from supernova remnants ( @xcite ) .",
    "we will here focus on the former process , usually called diffusive reacceleration since it can be treated as a diffusion in momentum space .    in heinbach & simon ( 1995 )",
    "it was shown that data on low energy cosmic rays are compatible with the predictions of models without diffusive reacceleration only if the mean path length variation with energy shows a sharp break around 12 gev . in models which include reaccelaretion effects on the other hand , depending on reacceleration strength , a path length distribution that is a simple power law for all energies",
    "may be considered .",
    "this is theoretically appealing since this from observations derived form agrees well with that expected from kolmogorov turbulence .",
    "the result in heinbach & simon ( 1995 ) is confirmed in the analysis by strong & moskalenko ( 1998 ) , who conclude as well that the reacceleration scheme allows a more natural choice for the parameters in the propagation model .    even though reacceleration implies that the average energy increases as the cosmic rays propagate through the galaxy",
    ", there is a general smearing of the injected spectrum meaning that there is also a ` leakage ' of cosmic rays from higher energies to lower .",
    "this might be important for antiprotons where the injected spectrum drops below the maximum at few gev . in simon & heinbach ( 1996 ) it was found that this leakage could substantially increase the secondary @xmath21 spectrum below 1  gev , with the flux at a few hundred mev that hardly can be lower than 1/3 of the value at around 1  gev .",
    "we can not compare directly with our analysis as we are not applying the same primary proton spectrum and propagation model , but still we can conclude that including reacceleration in the propagation model might add up to the effects of the proton - nuclei interactions and of the tertiary component in flattening the antiproton spectrum at low energies , and making it even more problematic to separate an exotic signal from the background in this region of the antiproton spectrum .",

    "@xmath220 is increasing in the low energy range as it contains the kinematic factor @xmath223 and at the same time we have assumed that the diffusion coefficient is roughly constant at low rigidities ( see eq .  ( [ eq : diffco ] ) ) .",
    "the coefficient @xmath220 then reaches a maximum at about @xmath224  gev , while at higher energies it decreases as a consequence of the 0.6 power law increase in the diffusion coefficient .",

    "fig : cprop ] ) roughly a 33% increase in @xmath220 ( and therefore in the signal from neutralino annihilations ) at any t , while the more cuspy profile with @xmath226  kpc gives a result which is more than twice the reference value .",
    "this is rather surprising because even though the singularity in the profile induces a sharp enhancement in the neutralino number density and therefore in the strength of the source , this cusp is at the galactic centre rather far away from the solar system .",
    "it is commonly believed that in the diffusion regime the local sources are the most relevant , but at least in the propagation model we are considering , this is not true : for the navarro et al .   profile with @xmath225  kpc , 23% of the signal",
    "is given by sources contained in a spherical region of 1 kpc around the galactic centre ; the percentage increases to 42% for @xmath222  kpc while it is as low as 1% for the isothermal sphere profile .",
    "we conclude that non - local sources may give a significant contribution provided their strength is much enhanced with respect to the local ones .",
    "this effect should be considered in more detail when considering a clumpy scenario  ( @xcite ) for which it may be even more relevant .",
    "[ fig : cprop ] contains another piece of information .",
    "going back to the case where the dark matter density profile is described by an isothermal sphere , we have varied the parameters which define the propagation model , going through the same three scenarios described when discussing the background . the band in the figure is given by fixing @xmath193 and varying the diffusion coefficient in the interval @xmath227 , and corresponds to the band shown in part ( a ) of fig .  [ fig : uncer ] ( again the highest value of @xmath196 gives the lowest value for the flux ) .",
    "unlike the latter , the band in fig .",
    "[ fig : cprop ] does not overlap the reference value ( solid line ) : for the signal from neutralino annihilations the decrease in the height of the propagation zone from 3  kpc to 2  kpc is not compensated by the decrease in the central value for the diffusion coefficient .",
    "this gives a first hint on how sensitive the dark matter signal is to the choice of the value of the height of the diffusion zone .",
    "the same effect is studied in the upper part of fig .  [",
    "fig : cpropunc ] , fixing the kinetic energy to @xmath228  gev , varying @xmath199 and linearly relating @xmath196 to @xmath199 , as introduced in the previous section . according to the webber - lee - gupta scenario ,",
    "@xmath199 is constrained to be between 1.1 and 3.8  kpc : the degeneracy we found for the background flux ( the nearly overlapping solid and dashed line in part ( a ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : uncer ] ) is completely removed for the signal from neutralino annihilations , going from an 80% suppression to a 20% increase compared to the reference value , for minimal and maximal @xmath199 respectively .",
    "changing the diffusion zone height modifies the number of sources which contribute to the flux , as sources which are outside the diffusion box are not included in the model .",
    "therefore it is not surprising that a very thin diffusion zone gives a suppressed signal while larger values for @xmath199 enhance it .    in the same way , in the thick halo scenario without convection , inferred from the analysis of strong and moskalenko , the suppression band found for the background flux ( part ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : uncer ] ) becomes a much wider band for which the signal flux is increased instead ( solid line in part ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : cpropunc ] ) .",
    "the enhancement with the diffusion zone height is flattened out at high values of @xmath199 as the new sources we include are further and further away from the observer and moreover the density profile falls at large galactocentric distances .    while the effects we have considered so far give roughly the same result for any value of the antiproton kinetic energy , the effect of convection in the z direction is clearly energy dependent . in part",

    "have been considered . as can be seen going back to part ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : uncer ] , the effect of convection is greater on the signal from neutralino annihilation than on the background flux . especially at low energies ,",
    "it is not well compensated by the linear scaling of the diffusion coefficient .    for the background flux",
    "the effect for introducing a galactic wind is to drive antiprotons more quickly from the disk , where they are generated , to the border of the diffusion zone where they are lost .",
    "this effect can be balanced by lowering the diffusion coefficient , that is , assuming that diffusion takes place less efficiently .",
    "the sources of the signal are on the other hand distributed over the whole diffusion box ; setting with the galactic wind a preferred direction of propagation lowers the probability for an antiproton generated relatively far away from the disk to reach our location .",
    "the effect is not compensated by the rescaling of @xmath213 , at least not for the rescaling needed for cosmic ray species generated in the disk .",
    "the last check we perform regards the role played by the antiprotons which are produced outside the propagation region .",
    "our solution to the diffusion equation has been derived under the hypothesis that the number density of the considered cosmic ray species is zero at the boundary of the diffusion zone .",
    "this is not strictly true for the signal from neutralino annihilations .",
    "one possibility of verifying what kind of corrections might be needed in this case is to compare the antiproton flux leaving the diffusion zone with the flux injected by external sources .",
    "we restrict the analysis to exchanges at the boundary @xmath232 , as the effect is much suppressed in the radial direction , being generally @xmath233 .",
    "the outgoing flux can be computed by keeping track of the full dependence on @xmath152 of the number density , as this flux is related to the gradient of the number density at the boundaries ; one derives a rather lengthy expression which we do not reproduce here but which follows in a straightforward way . for the injected flux we use the very simple picture of propagation in free space , summing contributions over the line of sight . for the modified isothermal sphere profile and a diffusion zone height of 3  kpc",
    "we find that the ingoing flux is about one third of the outgoing flux for very small radial coordinates , while they become roughly equal at @xmath234  kpc and at larger radii the injected flux becomes prevailing ; the total number of antiprotons per second that penetrate the diffusion box is about 70% of those that leave it .",
    "as can be understood , this fraction is smaller if we consider instead the navarro et al.profile or if we pick a higher value for the diffusion zone height , and might turn into a rather large number for very thin haloes . to give a precise numerical estimate for the effect one should add in the propagation model a third zone above @xmath235 .",
    "however , taking into account all the other uncertainties that enter in the prediction for the signal , we do not consider this worthwhile at present .",
    "we believe that a safe assumption is that the signal from neutralino annihilations has not been underestimated due to this effect by more that a factor of 2 in the most extreme cases .",
    "the antiproton spectrum from neutralino annihilation have been calculated for all the different mssm models given in table  [ tab : scans ] . in figs .",
    "[ fig : pbismx][fig : nicemodel ] we show our main results .",
    "we use our canonical parameters for propagation and the isothermal sphere model for the halo profile .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbismx ] ( a ) we show the predicted interstellar antiproton flux at a kinetic energy of 1 gev ( i.e. , without corrections for solar modulation ) versus the neutralino mass .",
    "we clearly see the trend that the flux goes down with the mass of the neutralino .",
    "the reason for this is that the number density of neutralinos goes down as the mass increases , for a given interval of the dark matter mass density . since @xmath236 , and the annihilation rate scales as @xmath237 the suppression increases rapidly with mass .",
    "at the lower mass end , the present accelerator limits preclude a neutralino in the mssm below a few tens of gev .",

    "[ fig : pbisoh2 ] we show the same fluxes as in fig .  [",
    "fig : pbismx ] ( a ) , but versus the relic density , @xmath241 .",
    "there is a very clear trend that the highest flux is obtained when @xmath242 is close to the lowest acceptable relic density .",
    "the reason for this is that if the annihilation cross section is increased , the flux of antiprotons increases , but since the relic density @xmath242 is approximately inversely proportional to the annihilation cross section , @xmath242 decreases and hence the strong correlation . the correlation is not perfect however , since it is the thermally averaged cross section at a temperature of about @xmath243 that determines @xmath242 , whereas the annihilation in the halo to a very good approximation occurs at rest ( the speeds are typically @xmath244 ) .",
    "this also exlplains some features in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbismx ] ( a ) .",
    "in the mass range between 40 and 60 gev there exist models which give exceedingly small rates , but also some which give the highest of all rates .",
    "this large spread reflects peculiarities near the @xmath245 ( and neutral higgs ) resonances and the @xmath246 threshold .",
    "for the low - flux models around 4060 gev , the annihilation cross section at rest is very small , but either a resonance or threshold can be reached through thermal motion in the early universe and the relic density is reduced to our selected range @xmath247 . as shown by chen & kamionkowski ( 1998 ) , three - body final states can be important ( not too far ) below the @xmath246 and the @xmath248 thresholds and this could enhance the signal for these low - rate models .",
    "we also have some models around 130 gev that give high fluxes . in this case",
    "it is the other way around , the masses are just so that we are on the @xmath249-resonance for the non - relativistic speeds in the halo , but the thermal average in the early universe gives a lower annihilation cross section and hence the relic density is increased to our desired range @xmath247 .",
    "the behaviour at 130 gev is just accidental , it could happen at any important resonance .",
    "in fact , we found only one high - flux model around 130 gev in our ` normal ' scans , and performed a small scan varying the parameters slightly around this model .",
    "the relic density was essentially unchanged , but the antiproton flux showed large variations depending on if we were below , on or above the resonance .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbisoh2 ] we also show models with a value of @xmath250 lower than our required limit of 0.025 . in principle",
    ", one could accept these models at the expense of introducing other components of dark matter . to be consistent",
    ", one should then rescale the local dark matter density in the form of neutralinos by some unknown factor . in the lack of better procedures , one usually employs a linear rescaling @xmath251 . since the annihilation rate is quadratic in the number density , this rescaling factor enters squared in the predicted @xmath252 rate , something which is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbisoh2 ] .",
    "we are now interested in finding out if there are any special features of the antiproton spectra from neutralino annihilation which distinguish these spectra from the background .",
    "we have already mentioned that the window at low energies may not be as good as previously thought .",
    "we will here investigate other features and energy regions of the spectrum to see if there are good signatures of a neutralino contribution to the flux .",
    "one thing that might differ is the slope at different energies .",
    "the background is expected to have a rising trend at low energies , reaching a maximum between 1 and 2 gev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : interst ] ) and a slope of around @xmath253 at high energies . on the other hand ,",
    "the high - rate models tend to be decreasing at 1 gev ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nicemodel ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this may cause a shift of the maximum of the summed spectrum ( signal plus background ) to a lower energy , which is a possible signature .",
    "we next investigate if there is an optimal energy at which @xmath254 has a maximum ( for this purpose we will use the reference background given in fig .",
    "[ fig : interst ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbtopt ] we show the flux at these optimal energies , @xmath255 , versus @xmath255 .",
    "we now see that we have two classes of models .",
    "one class which have highest signal to noise below 0.5 gev ( i.e.  inaccessible in the solar system due to the solar modulation ) and one which have highest signal to noise at 1030 gev .",
    "for this first class of models , we note that there exist a proposal of an extra - solar space probe ( @xcite ) which would avoid the solar modulation problem and is thus an attractive possibility for this field .",
    "however , these models have high rates in the range 0.51 gev as well , even though it would be even more advantagous to go to lower energies .",
    "the second class of models are much less affected by solar modulation and also give reasonably high fluxes . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicemodel ] ( a ) we show some examples of spectra .",
    "all of these have optimal energies in the low - energy region , but e.g.spectrum 3 has an optimum at high energy as well .",
    "we now turn to the solar modulated fluxes and will compare with the bess 97 measurements , which we recall are in very good agreement with our estimate for the background flux .",
    "we will compare the fluxes in two of the bess energy bins , the one at 0.35 gev and the one where the measured flux is the highest . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbsmmx ] we show the solar modulated fluxes versus the neutralino mass .",
    "we see the same general trend as for the interstellar fluxes , fig .",
    "[ fig : pbismx ] , but we also see that there are many models with fluxes above the bess measurements .",
    "however , this conclusion depends strongly on which range one allows for the neutralino relic density . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbsmmx ] we have coded the symbols according to the relic density interval .",
    "as can be seen , essentially all models which are in the bess measurement band have a relic density @xmath256 . if we instead require @xmath257 the rates are never higher than the measured flux .",
    "this points to a weakness of this indirect method of detecting supersymmetric dark matter : once the predicted rate is lower than the presently measured flux , the sensitivity to an exotic component is lost .",
    "this is because of the lack of a distinct signature which could differentiate between the signal and the background .",
    "alternative indirect search methods , like gamma rays from the halo ( see e.g.@xcite ) , or neutrinos from the sun or the earth ( see e.g.@xcite ) have the added virtue of giving both a directional and a spectral signature which can be used to improve the signal to background ratio well beyond the limits of present - day measurements .    the highest values for the fluxes in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbsmmx ] ( a ) are 4 times higher than the bess measurement .",
    "however , the uncertainty coming from the local halo density alone is larger than this . given the total mass of the galaxy , and restricting to our choice of halo profile ( isothermal sphere with @xmath258  kpc ) , we find a minimal local halo density of 0.14 gev/@xmath259 which would correspond to a flux reduction of a factor of 4.6 . to that one",
    "should add the uncertainties of the monte carlo simulations ( up to a factor of 2 ) and the halo profile , the propagation model and solar modulation .",
    "for this reason it is presently not possible to exclude any supersymmetric model on the basis of antiproton measurements alone .      in table  [ tab : examples ] we show 7 mssm models that all give high @xmath21 fluxes .",
    "these models have acceptable relic densities , cover a large mass range and have varying composition ( and obey present accelerator bounds ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicemodel ] ( a ) the predicted differential @xmath2 flux is shown for the 7 models .",
    "they show maxima occurring at lower energies than for our canonical background . at higher energies ,",
    "the trend is that the slope of the flux decreases as the neutralino mass increases .",
    "model number 3 corresponds to a heavy neutralino and its spectrum is significantly less steep than the background . if such a spectrum is enhanced , for instance by changing the dark matter density distribution , we would get a bump in the spectrum above 10 gev .",
    "in table  [ tab : examples ] we also show the annihilation rate and the most important branching ratios . with the help of the results in the earlier sections , the antiproton flux from neutralino annihilation can be derived .",
    "the difference between the parameterizations given in section [ sec : sim ] and the full simulation results ( that we have used ) is typically less than 20% .",
    "also note that the branching ratio to @xmath260 is never important for our high - rate models ( not only the ones in the table , but all high - rate models ) .",
    "this is not in agreement with the results found by jungman & kamionkowski ( 1994 ) .",
    "the reason for this difference is that we use the improved @xmath260 annihilation cross section of bergstrm and ullio ( 1997 ) .",
    "the table also contains an indication of the rates for other detection methods .",
    "the neutrino - induced muon flux in neutrino telescopes does not show a strong correlation with the @xmath21 flux , and it is possible to find models that give either low or high rates .",
    "current limits are about @xmath261@xmath262 muons km@xmath263 yr@xmath264 .",
    "we also give the spin - indepedent neutralino - nucleon cross section ( @xcite ) , which should be compared with the current limits that are of the order of @xmath265 pb .",
    "these show a better , but not perfect , correlation with the @xmath21 fluxes .",
    "the correlation is even stronger between the @xmath21 flux and both the @xmath266 flux and the @xmath267 flux with continuum energy spectrum .",
    "both of these do not decrease as much with neutralino mass as the antiproton flux does , however . for more details , see baltz & edsj ( 1999 ) and @xcite .",
    "the cross section for annihilation into monochromatic @xmath267s ( through @xmath268 and @xmath269 ) are uncorrelated with the @xmath21 flux .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig : nicemodel ] ( b ) we show an example of a hypothetical composite spectrum which consists of our canonical background flux decreased by 24 % ( obtained e.g.  by decreasing the primary proton flux by @xmath270 ) , and the signal for model 5 in table  [ tab : examples ] .",
    "we can obtain a nice fit to the bess data , but as noted before , there are no special features in the spectrum that allow us to distinguish between this case and the case of no signal .",
    "we have seen that there is room , but no need , for a signal in the measured antiproton fluxes .",
    "we have also seen that the optimal energy to look for when searching for antiprotons is either below the solar modulation cut - off or at higher energies than currently measured .",
    "however , there are no special spectral features in the signal spectra compared to the background , unless the signal is enhanced and one looks at higher energies ( above 10 gev ) .",
    "we have stressed the somewhat disappointing fact that since the present measurements by the bess collaboration already exclude a much higher @xmath2 flux at low energies than what is predicted through standard cosmic - ray production processes , an exotic signal could be drowned in this background .",
    "even if it is not , the similar shape of signal and background spectra will make it extremely hard to claim an exotic detection even with a precision measurement , given the large uncertainties in the predicted background flux ( at least a factor of a few , up to ten in a conservative approach ) .",
    "we note that some of the uncertainties may be reduced if an extrasolar probe aimed at low - energy detection would be launched , a possibility that has been recently proposed ( @xcite ) .",
    "although it is tempting to conclude that what has been measured by the bess experiment is the standard cosmic - ray induced background flux of antiprotons , one should keep in mind that it could , on the contrary , be almost entirely due to an exotic source like neutralino annihilation . since this possibility",
    "can not be excluded ( at least until the problem of the dark matter in the galactic halo has been solved ) , one has to be cautious about using the measured antiproton flux to deduce properties of antiproton propagation and , as has recently been done ( geer & kennedy 1998 ) , the antiproton lifetime .",
    "we have checked that , using one of our high - mass neutralino models and a clumpy distribution of dark matter in the halo , we can get an excellent fit to the bess data for antiproton lifetimes as low as @xmath271 years , clearly violating the claimed lower bound of geer & kennedy ( 1998 ) .",
