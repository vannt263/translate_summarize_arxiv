    "advances in the capabilities of modern day computing have allowed carrying line - by - line calculations in a systematic manner for the field of spectroscopy modelling .",
    "various applications such as species concentrations and temperature measurements in low pressure plasmas @xcite , or the calculation of radiative fluxes for atmospheric entry flows @xcite , greatly benefit from such techniques .",
    "however , the accuracy of such spectral simulations may vary consequently , depending on the methods used for line - by - line calculations , but also on the applied spectroscopic datasets .",
    "the different methods used for the calculation of key spectral parameters such as line positions , intensities , and shapes are discussed in this paper .",
    "available state of the art models for each of these parameters are presented , and some simplifications to such spectral models are discussed , leading to lower memory requirements and calculation times for the used computing systems .",
    "the models presented and discussed in this paper are valid for diatomic rovibronic transitions , but also for linear polyatomic rovibrational transitions ( such as transitions from the co@xmath0 molecule ) .",
    "the second part of this work presents some simulations of experimentally measured high resolution spectra issued from low pressure and high enthalpy plasmas .",
    "the discrepancies that may derive from the selection of different simulation models and spectral datasets will be highlighted through the comparison of different simulated spectra with the measured spectra .",
    "it will be verified that a careful selection of adequate models , linked to a selection of accurate spectroscopic data , may yield a very accurate reproduction of high resolution measured spectra .",
    "discrete molecular radiation can be characterized unambiguously through three parameters : line position , intensity , and shape    determination of line positions depends on the quantification of the energy levels of the molecule bound states .",
    "line intensities depend on the probabilities of transition between the different states , as well as on the population of these states . finally , line shapes depend on the local conditions of the gas in which the transition takes place .",
    "the first one allows a broad calculation of any number of vibrational and rotational levels for a given electronic transition of a molecule .",
    "calculations are performed using equilibrium constants , which give the vibrational and rotational constants for the given electronic transition in a broad range of vibration and rotation levels .",
    "the second one uses level - by - level spectroscopic constants and allows the calculation of any number of rotational levels for given electronic and vibrational transition levels of a molecule , as the band origin and rotational constants are set for each vibration level .",
    "this approach generally allows a better determination of specific vibration levels energies but prevents one from simulating further levels than those for which spectroscopic data is available .",
    "the third one , and the more accurate , requires diagonalising the corresponding hamiltonian matrix for each rovibronic state .",
    "this approach can be useful when the experimental spectra to be simulated is strongly perturbed although it leads to larger computational times .",
    "[ [ line - position - calculations - using - equilibrium - constants - in - matrix - form ] ] line position calculations using equilibrium constants in matrix form ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^    klein - dunham coefficients allow a clear and unambiguous determination of level positions , compared to the traditional spectroscopic developments , prone to confusions and errors ( for instance , the parameter @xmath1 , useful for the calculation of the rotational constant @xmath2 can sometimes be confused with the spin - rotation interaction coefficient @xmath3 ) .",
    "the use of klein - dunham expansions , unlike traditional developments , may also prevent situations were neglecting higher order corrections leads to considerable shifts for the position of calculated lines compared to the experimental spectrum @xcite .    setting a matrix of klein - dunham coefficients such as",
    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 in computer routines for line position calculations suffices in order to account for the available polynomial expansions as verified by a broad review of available spectroscopic coefficients by the author .    for multiplet transitions ,",
    "the expression for the level energies differs slightly from eq .",
    "[ eq : eevj ] , but the general form of the klein  dunham matrix can be used .",
    "expressions for the different multiplet level energies are presented in appendix [ sec : leven ] .",
    "when the level positions can no longer be accurately approximated through klein - dunham expansions ( as when vibrational perturbations of the spectra are present ) , spectroscopic constants for each vibrational level must be used .",
    "level spectroscopic constants obtained from fits of the rotational lines for each vibrational band are given in this case .",
    "using such level constants usually results in more accurate predictions of the level energies .",
    "however calculations are restricted to the vibrational levels were spectroscopic constants are available , unlike klein - dunham expansions which allow higher level extrapolations of the available spectroscopic data .",
    "when perturbations are present in the spectra , the polynomial expansions described previously no longer suffice for the accurate simulation of line positions .",
    "instead , one has to solve the hamiltonian matrix , taking into account the effects of the perturbing states using the perturbation method @xcite .",
    "this leads to very precise calculations of the line positions ( typically less than 0.1 ) .",
    "however , this method requires the calculation of the proper values of a @xmath8 matrix for each rovibronic state where @xmath9 is the level multiplicity .",
    "an overview of the different methods used for the calculation of line emission and absorption as well as the different difficulties and approximations seldom encountered will be presented in this section .",
    "[ eq : emicoeffdi ] highlights the additional difficulties related to line intensity calculations .",
    "these depend not only on the line positions ( through the accounting of the transition energy @xmath11 ) , but also on the transition probabilities @xmath12 and the number density of the initial state @xmath13 .",
    "although the two former quantities only depend on the transition parameters , being calculated according to quantum mechanics laws , the latter depends on the state of the studied gas .      the radiative properties of a gas can be unambiguously known through the determination of it s wavelength - dependent emission and absorption coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these two quantities are not independent however , and line absorption coefficients can be determined from the line emission coefficients .    the absorption coefficient including spontaneous and induced absorption ( adopting the normalization factor @xmath16 for the hnl - london coefficients and excluding broadening mechanisms ) is given by the relation          one can therefore deduce the following relationships between the einstein spontaneous emission coefficient @xmath12 , the einstein spontaneous absorption coefficient @xmath19 , and the einstein induced absorption coefficients @xmath20 :      as these relationships hold even in non - local thermodynamic ( nlte ) conditions , after simple algebraic manipulation",
    ", one can relate the line emission and absorption coefficients ( in wavenumber units ) through the expression        for the more restrictive case of a boltzmann distribution of the internal levels populations where one recovers the relation between the emission and absorption coefficient defined by planck s law ( eq . [ eq : planck ] ) .",

    "^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^          however , accurate calculations of atomic and molecular species partition functions requires a set of accurate spectroscopic constants up to higher quantum levels ( close to the dissociation limits for molecules and ionization limits for atoms ) .",
    "namely , the lowering of the ionisation threshold for atomic species has to be considered in the plasma state , when including the contribution of the atomic rydberg states to the overall partition function @xcite .",
    "also , for molecular partition functions calculations , it is necessary to determine the maximum rovibronic levels which can be achieved before the dissociation of the molecule occurs ( including superdissociative states ) .    out of thermodynamic equilibrium , no straightforward method for calculating the levels populations exists , and one has to resort to state - to - state models which explicitly take into account the different possible discrete states of a gas species .",
    "the development of accurate state - to - state models has been carried by different research teams , and the reader should refer to the references @xcite for a more detailed description of such models .",
    "expressions for the electronic transition moment can be found in the literature , either from spectroscopic measurements , or from  ab - initio \" calculations .",
    "this last method is usually preferred , as nowadays , quantum methods have achieved a very good precision @xcite .",
    "the vibrational wavefunctions are determined by solving the radial schrdinger equation on the potential curves of the upper and lower level potential curves .",
    "potential curves can be either calculated using ",
    "ab - initio \" methods , or reconstructed through the rydberg  klein",
    " rees ( rkr ) @xcite method according to experimental spectroscopic data .",
    "as modern spectroscopy is able to resolve line positions to less than the , level energies can be known to a greater accuracy than using ",
    "ab - initio \" methods . however , ",
    "ab - initio \" methods are able to reproduce the entire potential curve , whereas the rkr method can only yield the region of the potential curve where measured data is available . to overcome this problem ,",
    "the central part of the potential curve calculated through the rkr method is extrapolated by a repulsive potential at narrower internuclear distances , and by a hulburth and hirschfelder @xcite potential at larger internuclear distances , provided that the state dissociation energy is know .",
    "this method can only be applied for electronic states with a single potential with a shape close to a well , but this is fortunately the case for most of the electronic states for the molecules encountered in gas spectroscopy .",
    "a more detailed overview of the calculation of potential curves and vibronic wavefunctions can be found in @xcite .",

    "emission spectra from these molecules results mainly from rovibrational transitions , and a set of vibrational equilibrium constants can still be defined , with a more complex formulation ( an example for the co@xmath0 molecule is presented in @xcite ) .",

    "[ eq : emicoeffdi ] , as vibration - rotation interactions can be usually neglected in a rovibronic transition , owing to the usually large energy gap between the transition electronic levels .",
