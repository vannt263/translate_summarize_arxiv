    "the fruitful kolmogorov s mathematical school at the lomonosov state university in moscow is widely known for great achievements in dynamical system theory and mechanics by a.  kolmogorov ( 19031987 ) and his former students , v.  arnold ( 19372010 ) , ya .",

    "he was a student of august kundt ( 18391894 ) whose scientific roots are hidden in middle ages and could be traced to w.  of  ockham and f.  petrarch .",

    "we show only a small part of the novosibirsk school which is much more extensive .",
    "in fact , l.  i.  mandelstam was a founder of all the russian schools on nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear physics including the most remote and young one in vladivostok .",

    "the other one via the nobel laureates in physics i.  e.  tamm and v.  l.  ginzburg ( 19162009 ) and r.  n.  gurzhi ( 19302011 ) forms now the vladivostok school on nonlinear oscillations and acoustics .",
    "the third mandelstam s branch via s.  m.  rytov ( 19081996 ) and v.  i.  klyatskin forms the modern vladivostok school on hydrodynamical chaos and statistical physics .",
