    "the enhancement of the probability of having two bosons close in phase - space is a consequence of bose - einstein symmetrization . in astronomy , this effect was first observed by hunbary brown and twiss  @xcite who measured the angular size of stars using photon intensity interference . for particle physicists , it all started about 50 years ago when goldhaber _",
    "_ observed significant positive correlations between identical pions due to the bose - einstein effect  @xcite .",
    "it was almost two more decades before the availability of data with sufficient statistics and quality allowed pion interferometry to reliably extract spatial scales on the order of the interaction region , @xmath2  fm .",
    "later , with new facilities being built , the femtoscopic studies were extended to probe the sizes of the particle emitting sources as a function of the initial system size and the energy of the collisions as well as as a function of kinematic variables like the rapidity and the transverse momentum of the particle pair .",
    "the interferometry method has been applied not just to pions but also to heavier particles . in principle",
    ", a systematic comparison of femtoscopic results from the elementary particle collisions ( e.g.  ,  ,  ) through light nuclei ( e.g. @xmath3 ) and up to heavy ion collisions ( e.g. @xmath4 ) gives an opportunity to understand the physics of these collisions probed by two - particle interferometry . in practice ,",
    "such a comparison has been hampered by two problems .",
    "firstly , there have traditionally been a multitude of parameterizations of the bose - einstein effect , especially within the particle physics community .",
    "this , coupled with different analysis techniques , definitions of multiplicity , and acceptances , makes comparison of results between different experiments difficult .",
    "secondly , communication between the high energy and heavy ion communities has unfortunately been rather limited ; workshops such as this one should help rectify this situation .",
    "this article is not a complete review of femtoscopic results from high energy collisions .",
    "instead , we have collected a large fraction of the world dataset of such results and compare them in a common systematics .",
    "we focus on aspects of femtoscopy in elementary particle collisions that are important when comparing to heavy ion collisions .",
    "we also discuss some issues with results from  collisions that complicate their interpretation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : params ] we present different parameterizations of one- and three - dimensional correlation functions used to obtain results presented in this paper . a short summary of the most important observables in femtoscopic studies in heavy ion collisions",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : femtobig ] . in section  [ sec : worldsystematics ] we attempt to present a consistent picture of the femtoscopic observables in the elementary particle collisions . in section  [ sec : femtosmall ]",
    "we bring up a problem with mass dependence of hbt radii seen in  collisions and comment on the heisenberg uncertainty principle as a possible origin of both the mass ordering and the transverse mass dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "conclusions and discussion are presented in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the correlation function is defined as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the probability of observing two particles with momenta @xmath8 and @xmath9 , while @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote single - particle probabilities .    experimentally , the correlation function is defined as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a difference between momenta of two particles .",
    "@xmath14 represents a distribution of the pairs from the same event and @xmath15 is the background , or reference , distribution that is supposed to include all physics effects as @xmath14 except for femtoscopic correlations ( quantum statistics , final state interactions including coulomb and strong interaction , where applicable ) between the pair being studied .",
    "femtoscopic correlations in @xmath16-space may be expressed ( e.g  @xcite ) as a convolution of the pair spatial separation distribution with the two - particle wavefunction which includes quantum ( anti-)symmetrization and final state interactions effects . at large @xmath17 ,",
    "these effects vanish , and femtoscopic correlation functions must assume a constant value independent of the direction of @xmath16 . however , several experiments of collisions with low multiplicity ( e.g.  @xcite ) report correlation functions with large-@xmath17 structure which must be non - femtoscopic in origin .",
    "they may arise , for example , from jets or energy - momentum conservation .    especially in  experiments ,",
    "there has been tremendous effort to remove these effects using different techniques to form the reference distribution , @xmath18 in eq .",
    "[ eq : cfexp ] ( e.g.  @xcite ) . for identical particle interferometry ,",
    "these include using like - sign pion distributions or monte - carlo simulations to generate the reference .",
    "we do not review them all here , simply noting that each technique has its advantages , but none completely removes non - femtoscopic structures . at the end , the correlation function is fit with a functional form which includes ( or neglects ) the non - femtoscopic structure .",
    "a plethora of forms has been used over the years in high - energy particle measurements .",
    "we discuss some here .",
    "usually , one assumes that the measured correlation function approximately factors into a femtoscopic ( @xmath19 ) and a non - femtoscopic ( @xmath20 ) part .",
    "@xmath21      here , we list some fitting forms used in the high energy literature . if non - femtoscopic effects are ignored ( @xmath22 ) , then these are the forms used to fit the measured correlation function",
    ".    the 1d hbt radius can be obtained by fitting the correlation function ( eq .  [ eq : cfexp ] ) with an analytical parameterization .",
    "the most commonly used one , that assumes the gaussian source distribution , is defined as @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "another parameterization , also assuming a gaussian shape of the source distribution , but this with time @xmath13 is measured in the lab frame , is @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the source size , lifetime and chaoticity parameter .",
    "kopylov and podgoretskii  @xcite introduced an alternative parameterization @xmath31 ^ 2 \\left(1 +   q^2_0 \\tau^2 \\right)^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the transverse component of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34 , @xmath27 , @xmath35 and @xmath29 are the size and decay constants of a spherical emitting source , and @xmath36 is the first order bessel function .",
    "simple numerical studies show that @xmath28 from eq .",
    "[ eq : cfgauss ] is approximately twice smaller than @xmath37 obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : cfcp ] ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    with enough statistics ,",
    "a femtoscopic analysis may be performed in 2 or 3 dimensions .",
    "then , the correlation function is often expressed in the bertsch - pratt decomposition  @xcite @xmath38 where , @xmath39 is defined in the longitudinally co - moving frame , @xmath40 is the component parallel to the beam axis or trust axis ( in  ) , @xmath41 is measured in transverse plane and points into the direction of outgoing pair and @xmath42 is perpendicular to other two components .",
    "analogously , the sizes of the source along these three directions are denoted as @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "a similar form is used for two - dimensional correlation functions : @xmath46 where , @xmath47 .",
    "other groups have used double - gaussian  @xcite and exponential  @xcite fitting functions .",
    "a scan of the literature reveals even more . we do not wish to tabulate all the myriad forms used in high energy physics , but simply point out that this lack of a consistent analysis is rather a plague , greatly impeding any effort to make sense of the program as a whole",
    "many experiments ignore any non - femtoscopic contributions to the measured correlation function , setting @xmath22 ( c.f .",
    "equation  [ eq : factorization ] ) and simply fitting it with one of the forms above . of those that account for the long - range structure ,",
    "most simply choose a functional form that seems to describe the correlation at large @xmath48 , @xmath49 or @xmath32 , depending on the coordinate system used in the analysis , _ assume _ that it extrapolates smoothly into the femtoscopic region , and fit .",
    "these ad - hoc forms have no real foundation in physics , but are simply guesses .",
    "the most popular form , used e.g. in  @xcite , is @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are free parameters . in same cases ,",
    "this form was modified by setting @xmath53  @xcite or @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "an alternative one - parameter form was introduced in  @xcite @xmath55 for simplicity , we expressed above forms as a function of @xmath48 only , however , one can easily replace @xmath48 with e.g. @xmath49 or @xmath32 .    while expressing it analytically here",
    "would require additional explanation , yet another ad - hoc form was introduced by star  @xcite to describe the three - dimensional structure of the correlation function with two additional parameters .",
    "finally , a formulation has recently been proposed  @xcite which is not ad - hoc , but provides a full three - dimensional analytic form for @xmath56 , assuming that the non - femtoscopic correlations arise from energy and momentum conservation . recording the formula here would require extensive explanation , so we refer the reader to  @xcite for details . in this approach ,",
    "the extra `` parameters '' are physical quantities like the total multiplicity , average energy , and so forth .",
    "there are still other ad hoc forms not listed here .",

    "in such a scenario , approximately `` universal '' @xmath0 dependence of femtoscopic radii applies not only to pions but to all particle types .",
    "this is in fact observed experimentally and results have been presented in the left panel of figure  [ fig : scalings ] , in which one - dimensional radii from pion  @xcite , charged kaon  @xcite , neutral kaon  @xcite , proton and anti - proton  @xcite , and proton-@xmath59  @xcite correlations are plotted .",

    "all radii shown are from collisions with @xmath69  gev and increase with multiplicity . for collisions with @xmath70  gev ,",
    "the multiplicity systematics are less clear , since some experiments report a clear relationship and some do not , as shown in detail in figure  [ fig : multdep1dsep ] .",

    "right side of fig .",
    "[ fig : scalings ] ) .",
    "this may indicate that , in fact , there is no such universal scaling in particle collisions .",
    "however , even if there were a universal multiplicity dependence of femtoscopic scales , there are at least three other reasons for which such a scaling would not appear in figure  [ fig : multdep1d ] .",
    "firstly , as discussed in section  [ sec : params ] , the various experiments use different fitting functions to extract radius parameters . even when extracting the seemingly straightforward parameter @xmath58 with the form given by equation  [ eq : cfqinv ] , different parameterizations of the non - femtoscopic term @xmath56 were used to fit the measured correlation function ; c.f .",
    "equation  [ eq : factorization ] .",
    "secondly , as discussed below , the femtoscopic scales depend not only on multiplicity , but also kinematic quantities such as transverse momentum @xmath71 .",
    "the various experiments had significantly different acceptances , for which it is hard to account after the fact ; this will lead to systematic differences between one experiment s results and another s .",
    "for example , the tevatron experiment e735  @xcite was more biased towards high-@xmath71 particles than the other experiments .",
    "thus , one expects e735 s radii to be systematically lower ( for fixed multiplicity ) than the others ; this is precisely what is seen in figure  [ fig : multdep1d ] .",
    "thirdly , these experiments often use quite different definitions of `` multiplicity '' in their publications , making apples - to - apples comparisons more difficult . as best we could",
    ", we tried to compare results as a function of @xmath72 .",
    "for example , sometimes , the number of all particles per unit rapidity is reported ; in such case we assumed that charged particles are two - third of the total multiplicity .",
    "some experiments provide the number of charged particles in some range of pseudorapidity ( not always centered at @xmath73 ) .",
    "in such cases we assumed a flat @xmath74 distribution , and scaled .",
    "additionally , we may expect some unknown bias between experiments in the method of extracting the number of ( charged ) particles , since these multiplicities were often `` raw '' numbers , not corrected for efficiency .    in general",
    ", one would like to assign systematic errors from all of these effects , to see whether the data are indeed consistent with a `` universal '' multiplicity dependence .",
    "however , beyond what is described above , we were unable to do this from the information published by the collaborations , so settle for a study of trends .",
    "we note that these complicating issues are not problems for the heavy ion data , in which the communication between different experiments is good , and apples - to - apples comparisons are seen as a high priority .",

    "is observed in small systems , as seen in figure  [ fig : mtdep ] . recalling the discussion from section  [ sec :",
    "multdepsmall ] , we recall that these results come from different experiments , and that high energy particle measurements are hard to compare quantitatively . in particular , the average number of particles per unit of pseudorapidity is different in each experiment and as discussed above , the magnitude of the hbt radii depends on this value .",
    "additionally , as also discussed previously , somewhat different functional forms were used to extract the radii . however , despite these difficulties it is clear that pion hbt radii in elementary particle collisions show similar dependence on the transverse momentum as seen in heavy ion collisions , though it is not clear whether they have the same origin .",
    "in this section , we will discuss two issues with femtoscopic results from elementary particle collisions .",
    "the first one is related to experimental data and the second one to the interpretation of these data .",
    "as we showed in previous section , the pion hbt radii from small systems are decreasing with increasing transverse _ momentum _ , similar with the trend from heavy ion collisions .",
    "however , in heavy ion collisions , a scaling with transverse _ mass _ is seen for several particle types , not only pions .",
    "thus , in this section , we would like to investigate whether there is mass dependence of femtoscopic radii in elementary particle collisions .",
    "as there is insufficient data available from hadron - hadron collisions we will focus on data from  collisions only .",
    "there have been claims ( e.g.  @xcite ) of the mass ordering in these collisions , and these claims have been so often repeated so as to become `` common knowledge . ''",
    "however , we argue that a survey of  publications reveals a much less clear picture .",
    "we found two main reasons that complicate the systematic comparison of the data .",
    "the first is the tendency of  experiments to use very different fitting forms for the correlation function , even within one collaboration .",
    "we have discussed this extensively above in sections  [ sec : params ] and  [ sec : worldsystematics ] , so only mention it here .",
    "the second complication comes from the fact that experiments used various techniques to construct the reference distribution ( @xmath18 from eq .",
    "[ eq : cfexp ] ) .",
    "results from four  experiments , aleph , delphi , opal and l3 , are presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : epem ] .",
    "the upper panels show the mass dependence of hbt sizes measured using different techniques to construct the reference distribution from three experiments separately .",
    "the bottom panels present the same data but this time grouped by the technique of creating background of the correlation function .",
    "we make two interesting observations .",
    "firstly , not a single experiment used the same method to construct the reference distribution for pion , kaon and proton correlation function .",
    "instead , they used different techniques for different particles , and when we consider systematic errors that each technique introduces it is hard to make any quantitative statement about the mass dependence of hbt radii . secondly , when we group the data by a given method of reference generation ( lower panels of figure  [ fig : epem ] ) , identifying clear trends becomes more difficult .",
    "we believe that the only fair statement that we can make about the femtoscopic results from  collisions is that the size of the source for mesons is larger than that for baryons .",
    "as alexander pointed out  @xcite , this alone is a big problem for the lund string model .",
    ".,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the heisenberg uncertainty principle was pointed by alexander _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite as a possible origin of the mass dependence of the hbt radii in  collisions .",
    "authors argue that the dependence of the one - dimensional radius @xmath58 on the hadron mass obtained at lep is consistent with the formula derived from the heisenberg uncertainty principle @xmath75 where @xmath76 was chosen to be @xmath77 .    however , the good agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical curve ( eq .",
    "[ eq : hur ] ) presented by the authors  @xcite raises a concern especially in the light of what we just discussed in the previous section .",
    "in fact , when all results from  experiments are plotted together as done on figure  [ fig : allexps ] , we see that that it is difficult to make any quantitative statement about the mass ordering of hbt radii due to a significant systematic bias on the radii coming from the different techniques to construct the background of the correlation function and the spread of results coming from different experiments .",
    "the one - dimensional radius provides limited information about the source that is in fact a three - dimensional distribution .",
    "thus , to verify whether the heisenberg uncertainty principle can really explain the @xmath0 dependence of hbt radii one should look at three ( eventually two ) dimensional radii . the delphi experiment  @xcite report a decrease of three - dimensional radii with @xmath0 ; c.f . section  [ sec : worldsystematics ] .",
    "alexander argues  @xcite that the heisenberg uncertainty principle can best be applied to the longitudinal component of the radius @xmath78 ( sometimes noted as @xmath79 ) measured in lcms frame using similar procedure as it was done for @xmath58@xcite .",
    "the final formula gives approximately the same dependence of the longitudinal femtoscopic size on @xmath0 as in the 1d case @xmath80     dependence of the longitudinal component of the hbt source size for pions ; left panel : figure taken from  @xcite ; right panel : red circles represent delphi data taken from  @xcite .",

    "two points , however , about this figure .",
    "firstly , we believe that such a good agreement is partially a result of a mistake that was made by alexander .",
    "the author cites the following paper  @xcite as the source of the delphi results",
    ". however , we found that there is a discrepancy between the numbers presented in this paper and those plotted by alexander .",
    "the main ( and probably the only ) difference seems to be in the last point for @xmath81 where alexander s point is significantly larger than delphi published value .",
    "the correct delphi data from  @xcite has been plotted on the right panel of figure  [ fig : delphi ] represented by red circles . for comparison ,",
    "we plot the prediction from the heisenberg uncertainty relations ( eq .  [ eq : hurrz ] for @xmath82 represented by the solid black line .",
    "this is the same curve plotted on the left panel of figure  [ fig : delphi ] .",
    "we also performed a new fit to the correct delphi data ( red circles ) and found that the best @xmath76 that described the results is @xmath83 ( dash - dotted red line ) .",
    "this is not a serious mistake ; however the agreement between eq .",
    "[ eq : hurrz ] and experimental data is not as good as alexander showed in his paper  @xcite .",
    "thus , we think that this problem should be mentioned here since the figure plotted on the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : delphi ] was copiously cited in many other publications , including review articles ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the second point is about the delphi data themselves .",
    "while alexander refers to results presented in 1996 and published as proceedings in 1997  @xcite it should be also mentioned that the same experiment published , also as conference proceedings , newer results in 1999 and presented in 1998  @xcite that are different than the previous ones ( see blue triangles on the right panel of figure  [ fig : delphi ] ) . presumably , the later delphi results represent an improvement over the earlier ones , so it seems reasonable to use these . until a final result is published in a refereed journal we have fitted newer delphi data  @xcite using eq .",
    "[ eq : hurrz ] and found that the best value of the @xmath76 that described the experimental data is @xmath84 .    in heavy ion collisions , it is primarily the _ transverse _ hbt radii which reflect collective flow .",
    "thus , it is interesting to try to understand the @xmath0-dependence of femtoscopic parameters like @xmath85 , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "any direct connection between these radii and the uncertainty principle is unclear .",
    "claims that we understand the physics of ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions become much more compelling when a clear comparison of data from @xmath88 and  collisions are made and the differences explained .",
    "the importance of such a comparison is obvious in studies of jet suppression from azimuthal correlations  @xcite and leading particle distributions  @xcite at large @xmath71 .",
    "the transverse mass dependence of the femtoscopic results from heavy ion collisions at rhic is an important evidence of flow  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , a similar dependence is observed in small systems , as presented in section  [ sec : smallptdep ] .",
    "it has been even shown that not only there is the @xmath0 dependence of hbt radii in  collisions at rhic but it is very similar to what is seen in @xmath89 and @xmath4 collisions suggesting that the only scaling between small and big system is the size  @xcite .",
    "however , it is unclear whether the @xmath0 dependence in small systems originates also from `` flow '' .",
    "even though such explanation has been provided by csrg and collaborators  @xcite the literature includes rather alternative explanations . among them",
    "is the heisenberg uncertainty principle suggested by alexander",
    "_ et al . _",
    ". however , as demonstrated and discussed in section  [ sec : femtosmall ] , a more detailed study of the results from  collisions complicates the quantitative comparisons of the data and thus the interpretation .",
    "another physics process that could potentially generate the space - momentum correlations in small systems was the string fragmentation .",
    "however , as pointed out by alexander  @xcite , the mass dependence of the experimentally observed hbt radii ( especially the difference between mesons and baryons ) is a big problem for the lund string model .",
    "long - lived resonances ( e.g. @xmath90 ) may also generate a @xmath0 dependence of femtoscopic radii  @xcite .",
    "however , since the resonance `` halo '' length scale is fixed ( e.g. @xmath91 ) and the `` core '' scale varies by @xmath92 between  and  , one expects a different resonance - induced effect in the two systems .",
    "preliminary studies  @xcite with the therminator  @xcite model confirm this expectation .",
    "the different effect of resonances on the transverse mass dependence of the hbt radii on the system size has been demonstrated by therminator event generator  @xcite .",

    "provided a model  @xcite that assumes a proportionality between the four - momentum and the four - vector describing the particle space - time position at freeze - out and showed that it can explain the data from  collisions .",
    "other interesting observations come from the multiplicity dependence of femtoscopic radii in elementary particle collisions .",
    "surprisingly the results from various experiments show the increase of the femtoscopic sizes with the number of charged particles similarly as it has been observed in heavy ions collisions .",
    "these results should not be used as an evidence of flow but they strongly suggest that the only difference between the size of the source in small and big systems is the average multiplicity .",
