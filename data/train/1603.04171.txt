    "oj  287 is recognized as a quasar with roughly 12 year cycles in optical brightness , observed since 1890 s @xcite .",
    "its light curve is definitely not periodic @xcite but the deviations from periodicity are systematic and predictable in a model that contains a gravitational wave driven inspiralling spinning binary black hole system as its central engine @xcite .",
    "the prediction for the 2015/6 observing season was that oj  287 should have a major optical outburst in december 2015 , brightest optical level in 30 years ( see figure 1 in @xcite for the future light curve ) , coinciding with the centenary of general relativity .",
    "the exact timing of the optical outburst may be used to test predictions of the general relativistic binary black hole model @xcite .    the quasi - periodic pattern of optical outbursts of oj  287 was explained in 1995 by a model where a secondary black hole in a 12 year orbit impacts the accretion disk of the primary black hole at regular intervals @xcite .",
    "owing to the quasi - keplerian nature of binary black hole orbits in general relativity , the impacts and their associated electromagnetic radiation events can not occur in a strictly periodic manner @xcite .",
    "attempts to use purely newtonian orbit models , ignoring post - newtonian corrections , have failed @xcite.sdrasco / animations . ]",
    "however , it is indeed possible to find a unique mathematical description for the orbit in the post - newtonian approximation to general relativity , provided a long enough record of past radiation outbursts is available .",
    "the solution is sensitive to the loss in gravitational binding energy caused by gravitational wave emission and the lense - thirring effect that forces the binary black hole orbital plane to precess , mainly due to the spin of the primary black hole @xcite .",
    "an essential feature of the model is that the impact outbursts are generated by expanding bubbles of hot gas which have been shocked and pulled out of the accretion disk ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the process is astrophysically rather simple @xcite and the resulting radiation emanates from the vicinity of the impact site .",
    "thus , these thermal radiation events are excellent markers for tracing the orbital motion of the secondary around the primary black hole . in contrast , the shocks in jets which also arise as a consequence of the influence of the secondary have a complicated route from cause to effect .",
    "these `` tidal '' outbursts @xcite are also predictable in the binary model , but can not be used to construct the orbit as accurately as by using the record of the thermal events . in other systems the regularly repeated events in a jet may be a more likely alternative than thermal events @xcite .",
    "in anticipation of the predicted outburst , we organized a multisite optical observing campaign aimed at getting photometric and polarimetric data on oj  287 . both professional astronomical observatories and amateur observers took part in obtaining photometric data from the very beginning of the 2015/2016 season .",
    "the telescopes of amateur astronomers are in the 0.20@xmath40.30  m class @xcite .",
    "photometric observations were carried out by the following observatories : tuorla observatory in finland , mount suhora observatory of the pedagogical university and astronomical observatory of the jagiellonian university in poland , university of athens in greece , mount abu infrared observatory in india , and liverpool telescope , kungliga vetenskapliga akademien telescope , nordic optical telescope ( not ) , and william herschel telescope using acam instrument , in la palma , canary islands , spain ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "nightly means were calculated and posted on the campaign s web page .",
    "after november 14 , a steady rise of the object flux was noticed , and by november 25 it was apparent that it may develop into a major outburst , in the category observed only twice in 12  yr .",
    "we extended our observations by making them as long as possible each night , measuring also colors at some sites .",
    "the source kept brightening very rapidly until it was brightest it has been in 30  yr .",
    "after the december 5 maximum the source declined in stages , until it arrived at its pre - outburst level on december 30 ( see figure [ fig2 ] ) .    the major outbursts in oj  287 are recognized by a rapid rise to a narrow peak and then a slower decline with multiple smaller flares .",
    "the general shape of the curve in figure [ fig2 ] is based on a model of a uniform expanding sphere of plasma @xcite .",
    "however , as seen generally in observations _",
    "e.g. _ in 1983 @xcite , there is an initial , slowly rising part in the light curve with an additional peak at the maximum .",
    "this `` standard light curve '' @xcite is used here even though detailed theoretical models do not exist .",
    "the information on the nature of radiation at different stages of the outburst has been limited up to now . in 2007",
    "a good coverage of the outburst was achieved in polarization ; it showed that the major component of the outburst was unpolarized , superposed on a lower level of polarized synchrotron emission @xcite . in 1983",
    "the degree of polarization decreased close to zero at the high point of the light curve @xcite .",
    "therefore we have reasons to believe that an underlying unpolarized component , like the curve in figure [ fig2 ] , also exists in the 2015 outburst , in addition to the usual polarized flares .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the degree of polarization at different stages of the 2015 outburst .",
    "we superpose on the data the expected degree of polarization , by using the theoretical line in figure [ fig2 ] to separate the thermal and nonthermal components of the outburst .",
    "the solid line gives the ratio of the excess radiation above the theoretical line to the total flux , multiplied by 40 .",
    "this is what one might expect if the radiation below the theoretical line is unpolarized , as thermal bremsstrahlung should be , and superposed on it we have synchrotron flares with @xmath6 polarization .",
    "the second line assumes an additional @xmath3 contribution to the degree of polarization from the base level flux .",
    "this simple concept seems to work reasonably well .",
    "if our separation of the bremsstrahlung from synchrotron flares in the model is correct , then the x - ray emission , coming entirely from the jet , should follow the optical excess emission .",
    "the optical excess emission is defined as the total optical flux minus the bremsstrahlung flux , the latter separated from the total flux according to the line in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig45 ] shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "the x - ray flare is rather modest , much smaller than the optical outburst overall , but correlates very well with the excess flare emissions .",
    "the flares arising at this time are not different from flares observed during the campaigns of the previous twelve months ( edelson et al .",
    "there the x - ray flux was @xmath21 ergs @xmath20 s@xmath17 , while during our campaign it has been @xmath22 ergs @xmath20 sec@xmath17 , only slightly enhanced .",
    "the uv emission has followed the optical emission rather well in previous campaigns , using a spectral index of 1.35 between the two wavelength ranges ( based on data from the @xcite campaign ) of _ swift_/uvot .",
    "the figure shows that the new line in the _",
    "uvw2 _ channel follows the data rather well . above the thermal components",
    "there are the same nonthermal flares that are seen in optical .",
    "the _ swift _ _",
    "uvw1 _ and _ uvm2 _ band results are entirely consistent with figure [ fig45 ] .",
    "a more careful study is required to determine the temperature of the bremsstrahlung component at this time @xcite .",
    "the timing signals are extracted from the optical light curve by identifying the start of the outburst . from figure [ fig2 ]",
    "it appears that the outburst began on jd  2,457,342.5@xmath232.5 which corresponds to year @xmath24 . using the previously calculated correlation with the spin @xcite",
    ", we get for the kerr parameter of the primary black hole @xmath1 ( 2 @xmath25 ) .",
    "we have checked with orbit solutions , making use of this new timing , that the possible @xmath26 values range between 0.304 and 0.322 .",
    "this is a considerable improvement with respect to the previous value @xmath27 @xcite .    for a comparison with black hole spin determinations by x - ray spectroscopy ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these are based on determining the innermost stable orbit of the accretion disks in seyfert nuclei or low - redshift quasistellar objects ( qsos ) in the radio - quiet realm , or in x - ray binaries . some of the spins are comparable to the spin of oj  287 , others are close to the maximal value of unity , while the recently observed merger of two black holes produced a spin value of 0.67 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the x - ray spectroscopy method , in this blazar we are not dependent on understanding the physics of accretion disks close to the innermost stable orbit ; in this sense the orbital torque method is complementary to x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "the present outburst timing firmly confirms the correctness of the binary black hole central engine model for oj  287 within its specified parameter ranges , namely primary mass @xmath28  m@xmath29 , secondary mass @xmath30  m@xmath29 and orbital eccentricity ( as defined by using the apocentre / pericentre ratio ) @xmath31 .",
    "the present @xmath26 estimate opens up the possibility of measuring the dimensionless quadrupole moment of the primary black hole ( @xmath32 ) at the @xmath3 level during the next thermal outburst , predicted to happen in july 2019 ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this should allow one to test the black hole no - hair theorem by verifying the relation @xmath33 at that level @xcite .",
    "however , observing the predicted july 2019 thermal outburst from the earth will be difficult owing to the proximity of oj  287 to the sun at that time .    additionally , as demonstrated earlier @xcite",
    ", the occurrence of the outburst within the expected time window confirms the loss of energy by gravitational radiation within @xmath2 of the prediction by general relativity and is consistent with the no - hair theorem of black holes within an accuracy of @xmath34 .",
    "the energy loss from impacts on the accretion disk is four orders of magnitude smaller than the energy loss through gravitational radiation and thus plays no role in the binary model .",
    "finally we note that an exceptionally large amount of gas has been pulled away from the primary disk during this impact which occurred close to the apocentre of the binary orbit ( @xcite , see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this gas is expected to feed the two black holes for some time to come , and keep oj  287 active with flares .    the highly polarized ( @xmath35 polarization )",
    "flare near jd  2,457,380 is interesting ; its degree of polarization is the highest ever measured in oj  287 .",
    "the previous record was @xmath36 polarization measured in the secondary peak of the 1984 major event @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the secondary flare is closely connected with the first , unpolarized outburst .",
    "one possibility is the activation of the jet of the secondary black hole at these times .",
    "the secondary black hole is in the vicinity of the expanding cloud of plasma and will definitely accrete a major part of it  that is , the part which is expanding to its direction",
    ". it will be interesting to search for other evidence to associate the secondary flare with the secondary black hole .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the outburst in oj  287 in november ",
    "december 2015 agrees with the binary black hole model , both with regard to the timing and the expected brightness as well as a major outburst component being thermal .",
    "the fact that such thermal outbursts are excellent trackers of the secondary black hole orbit allowed us to estimate the spin value of the primary more narrowly than before , @xmath1 .",
    "this november  december outburst firmly confirms the presence of an inspiraling massive black hole binary in oj  287 .",
    "it therefore makes a fitting contribution to general relativity centenary celebrations of 2015/2016 , and adds to the excitement over the first direct observation of a transient gravitational - wave signal @xcite .",
