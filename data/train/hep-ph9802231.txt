    "the study of @xmath4-quark production in high - energy hadronic interactions offers the opportunity to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xcite .",
    "hadron - collider experiments usually consider the cross section integrated over a fixed range in rapidity @xmath5 and over all values of transverse momentum @xmath6 above a variable threshold @xmath7 .",
    "first measurements of such cross sections were performed by the ua1 collaboration at the cern @xmath3 collider with center - of - mass ( cm ) energy @xmath8  gev @xcite .",
    "more recent experimental results at @xmath9  tev were presented by the cdf @xcite and d0 @xcite collaborations at the fermilab tevatron . on the theoretical side ,",
    "such cross sections were calculated up to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) in the strong coupling constant @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the shapes of the theoretical curves agree well with the data of all three experiments , ua1 , cdf , and d0 .",
    "however , independent of the beam energy , the absolute normalizations of the experimental cross sections exceed , by about a factor of two , the respective predictions obtained with the conventional scale @xmath11 and a typical @xmath4-quark mass of @xmath12  gev .",
    "the experimental cross sections could only be reproduced by the theoretical predictions if @xmath13 and @xmath14 were reduced to @xmath15 and @xmath16  gev and parton density functions ( pdf s ) with particularly large values of the asymptotic scale parameter @xmath17 were chosen .    in the experimental studies ,",
    "the @xmath4-quark production cross section is not actually measured directly as a function @xmath7 .",
    "the original measurements refer to the production of @xmath0 mesons , which decay either semileptonically , or exclusively or inclusively into @xmath18 mesons .",
    "the cross sections for the production of bare @xmath4 quarks were then obtained by correcting for the fragmentation of @xmath4 quarks into @xmath0 mesons with the help of various monte carlo ( mc ) models .",
    "since this is a model - dependent procedure , it remains unclear whether the disagreement between the experimental data and the nlo predictions is actually real . in order to extract the @xmath4-quark production cross section",
    ", one needs an independent measurement of the fragmentation of @xmath4 quarks into @xmath0 mesons .",
    "in fact , two years ago the cdf collaboration published data on their first measurement of the @xmath0-meson differential cross section @xmath19 for the exclusive decays @xmath20 and @xmath21 based on the 19921993 run ( run 1a ) @xcite .",
    "similarly to the case of @xmath4-quark production , the measured cross section was found to exceed the nlo prediction by approximately a factor of two , while there was good agreement in the shape of the @xmath6 distribution .",
    "agreement in the normalization could only be achieved by choosing extreme values for the input parameters of the nlo calculation , _",
    "i.e. _ , by reducing @xmath13 and @xmath14 and by increasing @xmath17 @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the cdf collaboration extended their analysis @xcite by incorporating the data taken during the 19931996 run ( run 1b ) , which yielded an integrated luminosity of @xmath22  pb@xmath23 to be compared with @xmath24  pb@xmath23 collected during run 1a @xcite , and presented the cross section @xmath19 for the inclusive production of @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons with @xmath27  gev in the central rapidity region @xmath28 .",
    "again , the nlo prediction with input parameters similar to those used for the integrated @xmath4-quark cross section in refs .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath11 and @xmath12  gev ) was found to agree with the data in the shape , while its normalization came out significantly too low , by a factor of @xmath29 . here",
    ", it was assumed that the fragmentations of @xmath4 quarks into @xmath0 mesons can be described by a peterson fragmentation function ( ff ) @xcite with @xmath30 .",
    "this value for the @xmath31 parameter was extracted more than ten years ago from a global analysis of data on @xmath0-meson production in @xmath2 annihilation at pep and petra @xcite , based on mc models which were then up - to - date .",
    "the result of this comparison is to be taken with a grain of salt , since the underlying description of @xmath32 fragmentation is ad hoc and not backed up by model - independent data .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to improve on this situation .",
    "the fragmentation of @xmath4 quarks into @xmath0 mesons has been measured by the opal collaboration at lep1 @xcite .",
    "the produced @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons were identified via their semileptonic decays containing a fully reconstructed charmed meson .",
    "this resulted in the measurement of the distribution of the @xmath0 mesons in the scaling variable @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the measured energy of the @xmath35 candidate and @xmath36 is the lep1 cm energy .",
    "earlier measurements of the @xmath32 ff were reported by the l3 collaboration at lep1 @xcite . in the following , we shall base our analysis on the opal data , which have higher statistics and contain more @xmath37 bins than the l3 data .    at lep1 ,",
    "@xmath0 mesons were dominantly produced by @xmath38 decays with subsequent fragmentation of the @xmath4 quarks and antiquarks into @xmath0 mesons , which decay weakly . in the reaction @xmath39 at the @xmath40-boson resonance , the @xmath4 quarks and antiquarks typically have large momenta .",
    "a large - momentum @xmath4 quark essentially behaves like a massless particle , radiating a large amount of its energy in the form of hard , collinear gluons .",
    "this leads to the presence of logarithms of the form @xmath41 originating from collinear singularities in a scheme , where @xmath14 is taken to be finite .",
    "these terms appear in all orders of perturbation theory and must be resummed .",
    "this can be done by absorbing the @xmath14-dependent logarithms into the ff of the @xmath4 quark at some factorization scale of order @xmath42 .",
    "alternatively , one can start with @xmath43 and factorize the collinear final - state singularities into the ff s according to the @xmath1 scheme , as is usually done in connection with the fragmentation of light quarks into light mesons .",
    "this is the so - called massless scheme @xcite , in which @xmath14 is neglected , except in the initial conditions for the ff s .",
    "this scheme was used for nlo calculations of charm and bottom production in @xmath2 @xcite , @xmath3 @xcite , @xmath44 @xcite , and @xmath45 @xcite collisions , with the additional feature that the massless @xmath46 and @xmath4 quarks were transformed into their massive counterparts by the use of perturbative ff s @xcite .",
    "these perturbative ff s enter as a theoretical input at a low initial scale @xmath47 of order @xmath48 or @xmath14 , respectively , and are subject to evolution to higher scales @xmath13 with the usual altarelli - parisi ( ap ) equations @xcite .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , this theory was extended by including nonperturbative ff s , which describe the transition from heavy quarks to heavy mesons @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we describe the fragmentation of massless @xmath4 quarks into @xmath0 mesons by a one - step process characterized entirely in terms of a nonperturbative ff , as is usually done for the fragmentation of @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 quarks into light mesons .",
    "we assume simple parametrizations of the @xmath4-quark ff at the starting scale . we determine the parameters appearing therein through fits to the opal data @xcite at lowest order ( lo ) and nlo .",
    "these @xmath4-quark ff s are then used to predict the differential cross section @xmath19 of @xmath0-meson production in @xmath3 scattering at @xmath9  tev , which can be directly compared with recent data from the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .  2 , we recall the theoretical framework for the extraction of ff s from @xmath2 data , which was previously used for @xmath46-quark fragmentation into @xmath52 mesons @xcite , and present our results for the @xmath4-quark ff s at lo and nlo in the @xmath1 factorization scheme with five massless flavors .",
    "we assume three different forms for the ff s at the starting scale , which enables us to assess the resulting theoretical uncertainty in other kinds of high - energy processes , such as @xmath3 scattering . in sec .  3",
    ", we apply the nonperturbative ff s thus obtained to predict the cross section of @xmath0-meson production in @xmath3 collisions at the tevatron and compare the result with recent data from cdf @xcite .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec .",
    "our procedure to construct lo and nlo sets of ff s for @xmath0 mesons is very similar to the case of @xmath53 mesons treated in refs .",
    "here we only give those details which differ from refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the opal data on the inclusive production of @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons in @xmath2 annihilation at the @xmath40-boson resonance serve as our experimental input @xcite .",
    "these data are presented as differential distributions in @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the measured energy of the @xmath25 or @xmath26 candidate .",
    "this function peaks at fairly large @xmath37 . for the fitting procedure we use the experimental @xmath37 bins , with width @xmath54 , in the interval @xmath55 and integrate the theoretical functions over @xmath56 , which is equivalent to the experimental binning procedure .",
    "there is a total of nine data points .",
    "when we talk about the @xmath32 ff , we have in mind the four fragmentation processes @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the respective branching fractions are all assumed to be equal .",
    "if we neglect the influence of the electroweak interactions , this follows from the @xmath61 flavor symmetry and the charge - conjugation invariance of qcd .",
    "we thus make the stronger assumption that the ff s of these four processes all coincide .",
    "we take the starting scales for the ff s of the gluon and the @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath46 , and @xmath4 quarks and antiquarks into @xmath0 mesons to be @xmath62 , with @xmath63  gev .",
    "the ff s of the gluon and the first four quark flavors are assumed to be zero at the starting scale .",
    "these ff s are generated through the @xmath13 evolution .",
    "for the parametrization of the @xmath4-quark ff at the starting scale @xmath47 , we employ three different forms .",
    "the first one is usually adopted for the ff s of light hadrons , namely @xmath64 this form has been used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe the nonperturbative effects of @xmath4-quark fragmentation , in addition to a perturbative contribution .",
    "the standard ( s ) parametrization  ( [ standard ] ) depends on three free parameters , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , which are determined by fits to the opal data @xcite after evolution to the factorization scale @xmath68 . as our second parameterization , we use the peterson ( p ) distribution @xcite ,",
    "@xmath69 ^ 2}.\\ ] ] this choice is particularly suited to describe a ff that peaks at large @xmath37 .",
    "it has been frequently used in connection with the fragmentation of heavy quarks , such as @xmath46 or @xmath4 quarks , into their mesons .",
    "it depends only on two parameters , @xmath65 and @xmath31 .",
    "the third parametrization is theoretically motivated .",
    "there exists a particular class of ff s which are calculable in perturbative qcd , namely those of gluons and heavy quarks into heavy - heavy bound states , such as @xmath70 , @xmath71 @xcite , and @xmath72 mesons @xcite .",
    "these perturbative ff s can also be applied to describe the fragmentation of @xmath4 quarks into bound states of @xmath4 and light quarks , in the sense of a model assumption rather than a formula derived in perturbative qcd .",
    "the formula for the @xmath73 transition was derived by braaten ( b ) _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite and reads @xmath74 ^ 6 } \\left[6 - 18(1 - 2r)x+(21 - 74r+68r^2)x^2\\right .",

    "similar formulas also exist for @xmath77 @xcite .",
    "navely applying this formula for @xmath78 to the fragmentation process @xmath32 would yield a rather small number , which is not well determined .",
    "thus , our philosophy is to treat @xmath65 and @xmath78 as free parameters if one of the quarks in the bound state is light . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the branching fraction of @xmath79 was found to be two orders of magnitude smaller than the one of @xmath73 . extrapolating to the case of @xmath0 mesons",
    ", it hence follows that our assumption @xmath80 , where @xmath81 denotes a light quark , should be well founded even if @xmath81 is the light constituent of the @xmath0 meson .",
    "we calculate the cross section @xmath82 for @xmath83 to lo and nlo in the @xmath1 scheme with five massless quark flavors as described in ref .",
    "@xcite , where all relevant formulas and references may be found . in particular , we choose the renormalization and factorization scales to be @xmath84 . as for the asymptotic scale parameter appropriate for five active quark flavors ,",
    "we adopt the lo ( nlo ) value @xmath85  mev ( 227  mev ) from ref .  @xcite . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we solve the ap equations in @xmath37 space by iteration of the corresponding integral equations . in the appendix of ref .",

    "i.e. _ , with the coefficients of the delta functions and plus distributions explicitly displayed .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we take the @xmath4-quark mass to be @xmath63  gev . since @xmath14 only enters via the definition of the starting scale @xmath47 , its precise value is immaterial for our fit .",
    "the opal data are presented in fig .  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite as the distribution @xmath86 normalized to the bin width @xmath54 .",
    "in order to convert these data to the inclusive cross section @xmath82 , we need to multiply them by the overall factor @xmath87 , where @xmath88 , @xmath89 is the measured @xmath32 branching fraction , and the factor of two accounts for the fact that our cross - section formula @xcite includes the fragmentation of both @xmath4 and @xmath90 .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we identify @xmath91 . for consistency",
    ", we adopt the opal results @xmath92 @xcite and @xmath93 @xcite , where the first ( second ) error is statistical ( systematic ) .",
    "the values for the input parameters in eqs .",
    "( [ standard ] ) , ( [ peterson ] ) , and ( [ kingman ] ) which result from our lo and nlo fits to the opal data are summarized in table  [ t1 ] . in the following ,",
    "we refer to these ff s as sets lo  s , nlo  s , lo  p , nlo  p , lo  b , and nlo  b , respectively .",
    "the corresponding @xmath94 values per degree of freedom ( @xmath95 ) are listed in the last column of table  [ t1 ] ; there is a total of nine degrees of freedom . except for the sets of type s , the @xmath95 values for the nlo",
    "fits are slightly lower than those for the lo fits .",
    "the peterson ansatz  ( [ peterson ] ) yields the best fits .",
    "this is surprising , since it has only two free parameters , one less than the the standard form  ( [ standard ] ) .",
    "the sets of type b have the largest @xmath95 values .",
    "since the @xmath4-quark ff is peaked at @xmath96 , we have @xmath97 in the case of sets lo  s and nlo  s. the @xmath31 parameters of sets lo  p and nlo  p are larger than the standard value @xmath98 @xcite usually quoted in the literature .",
    "it is important to note that the values of @xmath31 obtained in the various analyses depend on the underlying theory for the description of the fragmentation process @xmath32 , in particular , on the choice of the starting scale @xmath47 , on whether the analysis is done in lo or nlo ( as may be seen from table  [ t1 ] ) , and on how the final - state collinear singularities are factorized in nlo .",
    "we emphasize that our results for @xmath31 in table  [ t1 ] refer to the pure @xmath1 factorization scheme with five massless flavors and @xmath99  gev .",
    "if we were to interpret the values for @xmath78 in table  [ t1 ] with the formula @xmath100 , which is navely adapted from the analogous definition for @xmath72 bound states @xcite , then we would find @xmath101  mev and 924  mev at lo and nlo , respectively .",
    "these values are a factor of 23 larger than the generally assumed constituent - quark masses of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 quarks .",
    "this just illustrates the model character of using ansatz  ( [ kingman ] ) in connection with heavy - light bound states .    in figs .",
    "[ f1](a)[f1](c ) , we compare the opal data @xcite with the theoretical results evaluated with sets s , p , and b , respectively . except at low @xmath37 ,",
    "the lo and nlo results are very similar . at low @xmath37",
    ", we observe significant differences between lo and nlo . in this region ,",
    "the perturbative treatment ceases to be valid .",
    "here , the massless approximation also looses its validity . since @xmath0 mesons have mass , @xmath102  gev , they can only be produced for @xmath103 .",
    "the lo result has a minimum in the vicinity of @xmath104 and strongly increases as @xmath105 .",
    "therefore , our results should only be considered meaningful for @xmath106 with @xmath107 , say . as already observed in connection with the @xmath95 values , sets lo  p and nlo  p give the best description of the data .",
    "the contribution due to gluon fragmentation , which only enters at nlo , is insignificant , below 1% .",
    "the contribution due to the first four quark flavors is mostly concentrated at low @xmath37 and is also very small . for @xmath108",
    ", it makes up less than 1% of the total integrated cross section .",
    "it is interesting to study the @xmath32 branching fraction , @xmath109 where , for reasons explained above , we have introduced a lower cutoff at @xmath107 . in table",
    "[ t2 ] , we present the values of @xmath110 at threshold @xmath111 and at the @xmath40-boson resonance @xmath112 for the various ff sets .",
    "as expected , @xmath110 is rather stable under the evolution from @xmath113 to @xmath42 .",
    "the values of @xmath114 are consistent with the input @xmath93 @xcite which was used to scale the experimental data points @xcite so as to obtain the fully normalized cross section .",
    "another quantity of interest is the mean @xmath0 to @xmath4 momentum fraction , @xmath115 table  [ t2 ] also contains the values of @xmath116 at @xmath111 and @xmath42 evaluated with the various ff sets .",
    "the differences between sets s , p , and b on the one side and between lo and nlo on the other side are small .",
    "as @xmath13 runs from @xmath113 to @xmath42 , @xmath116 decreases from approximately 0.8 down to below 0.7 .",
    "this is a typical feature of the @xmath13 evolution , which generally softens the ff s .",
    "our values of @xmath117 can be compared with the experimental result reported by opal @xcite , @xmath118 where the errors are statistical , systematic , and due to model dependence , respectively .",
    "our results in table  [ t2 ] are in reasonable agreement with eq .",
    "( [ opal ] ) . in connection to this",
    ", we remark that eq .",
    "( [ opal ] ) is not directly obtained from the measured distribution , which would be difficult to do , since there are no data points below @xmath119 . to extrapolate to the unmeasured region , opal uses four different models which describe the primordial fragmentation of @xmath4 quarks inside their mc simulation .",
    "equation  ( [ opal ] ) is actually determined from the mc fits to the measured data points .",
    "obviously , the quoted error for the model dependence can only account for the specific model dependence inside their particular mc approach , and need not be characteristic of the absolute model dependence .",
    "a rather model - independent fit to the @xmath37 distribution , including a mc estimate for the region @xmath120 , leads to @xmath121 @xcite , where the error is only statistical and does not account for the uncertainty due to the extrapolation .",
    "our results in table  [ t2 ] are somewhat smaller than this value and are barely consistent with the experimental error given above .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that our results in table  [ t2 ] are in reasonable agreement with the independent determinations of @xmath117 quoted in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section , we compare our lo and nlo predictions for the cross section of inclusive @xmath35 production in @xmath3 collisions at the tevatron ( @xmath9  tev ) with recent data from the cdf collaboration @xcite .",
    "these data come as the @xmath6 distribution @xmath19 integrated over the central rapidity region @xmath28 for @xmath6 values between 7.4 and 20 gev .",
    "they are normalized in such a way that they refer to the single channel @xmath122 . in the case of run 1a , where both @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons were detected ,",
    "the respective cross sections were averaged , _",
    "i.e. _ , their sum was divided by a factor of two .",
    "our formalism is very similar to ref .",
    "@xcite , where inclusive light - meson production in @xmath3 collisions was studied in the qcd - improved parton model .",
    "the relevant formulas and references may be found in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we refrain from repeating them here .",
    "we work at nlo in the @xmath1 scheme with @xmath123 massless flavors . for the proton and antiproton pdf s ,",
    "we use set cteq4 m @xcite with @xmath124  mev .",
    "we evaluate @xmath10 from the two - loop formula with this value of @xmath125 .",
    "we recall that the evolution of the ff sets nlo  s , nlo  p , and nlo  b is performed with @xmath126  mev , which is very close to the above value .",
    "we identify the factorization scales associated with the proton , antiproton , and the @xmath0 meson and collectively denote them by @xmath127 .",
    "we choose renormalization and factorization scales to be @xmath128 , where @xmath129 is the @xmath0-meson transverse mass .",
    "whenever we present lo results , they are consistently computed using set cteq4l @xcite of the proton and antiproton pdf s , our lo sets of @xmath0-meson ff s , the one - loop formula for @xmath10 with @xmath130  mev @xcite , and the lo hard - scattering cross sections .",
    "we adopt the kinematic conditions from ref .  @xcite . since we employ @xmath131 both for the @xmath4 and @xmath90 quarks , the resulting cross section corresponds to the sum of the @xmath25 and @xmath132 yields .",
    "thus , it needs to multiplied by a factor of 1/2 , in order to match the cross section quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "first , we consider the @xmath6 distribution @xmath19 integrated over the rapidity region @xmath28 as in the cdf analysis @xcite . in fig .  [ f2](a )",
    ", we compare the cdf data @xcite with the lo and nlo predictions evaluated with our various sets of @xmath0-meson ff s .",
    "the nlo distributions fall off slightly less strongly with increasing @xmath6 than the lo ones .",
    "the results for sets lo  s , lo  p , and lo  b almost coincide .",
    "the same is true of the results for sets nlo  s , nlo  p , and nlo  b. this means that the details of the @xmath32 fragmentation is tightly constrained by the lep data , and that the considered variation in the functional form of the @xmath4-quark ff at the starting scale has very little influence on the @xmath6 distribution .",
    "henceforth , we shall only employ sets lo  p and nlo  p , which yielded the best fits to the opal data @xcite .",
    "we observe that our prediction agrees very well with the cdf data , within their errors .",
    "this is even true for the data point with smallest @xmath6 , @xmath133  gev , where the massless approach is presumably not valid any more .",
    "it should be emphasized that the nlo prediction reproduces both the shape and the absolute normalization of the measured @xmath6 distribution , while the previous investigations mentioned in the introduction fell short of the data by roughly a factor of two .",
    "the cdf collaboration has not yet presented results on the @xmath5 distribution of the produced @xmath0 mesons , which would allow for another meaningful test of the qcd - improved parton model endowed with @xmath0-meson ff s .",

    "[ f2](b ) the @xmath5 dependence of @xmath134 evaluated with sets lo  p and nlo  p at @xmath135 , 17.2 , 20 , and 30  gev .",
    "the first three of these @xmath6 values are among those for which cdf performed measurements of @xmath136 @xcite .",
    "since the @xmath5 spectrum is symmetric around @xmath137 , we only consider @xmath138 in fig .",
    "[ f2](b ) .",
    "as expected , the cross section falls off with @xmath5 increasing from zero up to the kinematic limit , which depends on @xmath6 .",
    "in order to assess the reliability of our predictions , at least to some extent , we now investigate the scale dependence of the cross section considered in fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) . to this end",

    "the lo results for @xmath19 essentially decrease with @xmath139 increasing , whereas the nlo results are rather @xmath139 independent and exhibit points of horizontal tangent close to @xmath142 .",
    "furthermore , the lo and nlo curves intersect near these points .",
    "thus , the scale choice @xmath142 is favoured both from the principles of minimal sensitivity @xcite and fastest apparent convergence @xcite .",
    "these observations reassure us of the perturbative stability and the theoretical soundness of our calculation in the upper @xmath6 range . for @xmath135  gev",
    ", the nlo prediction of @xmath19 shows a stronger scale dependence , in particular , when the scale is drastically reduced . if we limit the scale variation to the interval @xmath143 , which is frequently considered in the literature , the nlo cross section still varies by a factor of 1.56 , to be compared with 1.15 at @xmath141  gev .",
    "we hence conclude that , below @xmath135  gev , our nlo predictions should be taken with a grain of salt .",
    "the dents in the curves for @xmath135  gev appear at the value of @xmath139 where @xmath144 .",
    "this is because we identify @xmath145 if @xmath146 , _",
    "i.e. _ , the ff s are frozen below their threshold .",
    "we must also remember that , for @xmath6 values comparable to @xmath14 , the massless - quark approximation ceases to be valid , since terms of order @xmath147 are then not negligible anymore . for @xmath135  gev and 20  gev",
    ", we have @xmath148 and 0.063 , respectively , so that the massless approximation should certainly be valid for @xmath141  gev . on the other hand , for @xmath141  gev",
    ", we have @xmath149 , assuming that @xmath150 , so that the nlo calculation in the massive scheme , where these logarithmic terms are not resummed , should then already be inadequate . from these considerations",
    ", we conclude that our predictions should be fairly reliable for @xmath151  gev .",
    "in this paper , we considered the inclusive production of single @xmath0 mesons in the qcd - improved parton model endowed with nonperturbative ff s .",
    "we chose to work at nlo in the pure @xmath1 factorization scheme with five massless quark flavors .",
    "this theoretical framework is known to lead to an excellent description of a wealth of experimental information on inclusive light - hadron production in different types of high - energy reactions @xcite .",
    "it is thus expected to also work well in the case of @xmath0 mesons provided that the characteristic mass scale @xmath152 of the process by which they are produced is large compared to the @xmath4-quark mass .",
    "then , the large logarithms of the type @xmath153 which are bound to arise in any scheme where bottom is treated as a massive flavor get properly resummed by the ap evolution , while the omission of the terms suppressed by powers of @xmath154 is a useful approximation . the criterion @xmath155 is certainly satisfied for @xmath2 annihilation on the @xmath40-boson resonance , and for hadroproduction of @xmath0 mesons with @xmath156 . owing to the factorization theorem ,",
    "the ff s are universal in the sense that they just depend on the produced hadrons and the partons from which they sprang , but not on the processes by which the latter were produced .",
    "thus , the theoretical framework adopted here is particularly suited for a consistent description of lep1 and high-@xmath6 tevatron data of inclusive @xmath0-meson production . by the same token , a massive calculation at fixed order would be inappropriate for this purpose .",
    "our procedure was as follows .",
    "we determined lo and nlo @xmath0-meson ff s by fitting the fractional energy distribution of the @xmath0-meson sample collected by the opal collaboration at lep1 @xcite . in order to get some handle on the theoretical uncertainty",
    ", we adopted three different functional forms for the @xmath32 ff at the starting scale , which we took to be @xmath99  gev .",
    "the ansatz proposed by peterson _ et al . _",
    "@xcite yielded the best lo and nlo fits , with @xmath157 and 0.27 , respectively .",
    "the @xmath31 parameter , which measures the smearing of the peterson distribution , came out as 0.0126 and 0.0198 , respectively , _",
    "i.e. _ , more than twice as large as the standard value @xmath30 determined by chrin @xcite more than a decade ago , before the lep1 era . in this connection",
    ", we should emphasize that the results for the fit parameters , including the value of @xmath31 , are highly scheme dependent at nlo , and must not be navely compared disregarding the theoretical framework to which they refer .",
    "the @xmath32 branching fraction and the mean @xmath0 to @xmath4 momentum fraction evaluated from the resulting ff s after the evolution to @xmath112 turned out to be in reasonable agreement with the model - dependent determinations by opal @xcite . using our ff s , we made theoretical predictions for the inclusive hadroproduction of single @xmath0 mesons with large @xmath6 .",
    "we found good agreement , both in shape and normalization , with the @xmath6 distribution recently measured in the central rapidity region by the cdf collaboration at fermilab @xcite . from the study of the scale dependence of the lo and nlo calculations",
    ", we concluded that our results should be reliable for @xmath151  gev . to our surprise , the central prediction , with scales @xmath128 , also nicely agreed with the cdf data in the low-@xmath6 range , where the massless scheme is expected to break down .",
    "we recall that the massive nlo calculation with traditional peterson fragmentation @xcite was found to fall short of these data by a factor of two",
    ". it would be interesting to also test the predicted @xmath5 distribution against experimental data .",
