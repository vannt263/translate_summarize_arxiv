    "following the pioneering discovery of the feigenbaum - coullet - tresser period doubling universality in unimodal maps @xcite universality has been demonstrated to be a rather generic phenomenon in dynamics .    to prove universality one usually introduces a _ renormalization _ operator in a functional space , and demonstrates that this operator has a hyperbolic fixed point .",
    "such renormalization approach to universality has been very successful in one - dimensional dynamics , and has led to explanation of universality in unimodal maps @xcite , critical circle maps @xcite and holomorphic maps with a siegel disks @xcite .",
    "universality has been also abundantly observed in higher dimensions , in particular , in two and more dimensional dissipative systems ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) , in area - preserving maps , both as the period doubling universality @xcite , and as the universality associated with the break - up of invariant surfaces @xcite , and in hamiltonian flows @xcite .    in this paper we will consider a period doubling universality for area - preserving maps of the plane",
    " an analogue of feigenbaum - coullet - tresser universality in higher dimensions .    an infinite period doubling cascade in families of area - preserving maps was observed by several authors in early 80 s @xcite .",
    "a typical period doubling scenario can be illustrated with the area - preserving h ' enon family ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath1    maps in this family posses a fixed point @xmath2 which is stable for @xmath3 .",
    "when @xmath4 this fixed point becomes unstable , at the same time an orbit of period two is born with @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "this orbit , in turn , becomes unstable at @xmath7 , giving birth to a period @xmath8 stable orbit .",
    "generally , there exists a sequence of parameter values @xmath9 , at which the orbit of period @xmath10 turns unstable , while at the same time a stable orbit of period @xmath11 is born .",
    "the parameter values @xmath9 accumulate on some @xmath12 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the accumulation rate @xmath13 is universal for a large class of families , not necessarily hnon .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath11 periodic orbits scale asymptotically with two scaling parameters @xmath14    to explain how orbits scale with @xmath15 and @xmath16 we will follow @xcite . consider an interval @xmath17 of parameter values in a ` ' typical  family @xmath18 . for",
    "any value @xmath19 the map @xmath20 posses a stable periodic orbit of period @xmath11 .",
    "we fix some @xmath21 within the interval @xmath17 in some consistent way ; for instance , by requiring that the restriction of @xmath22 to a neighborhood of a stable periodic point in the @xmath23-periodic orbit is conjugate via a diffeomorphism @xmath24 to a rotation with some fixed rotation number @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath26 be some unstable periodic point in the @xmath10-periodic orbit , and let @xmath27 be the further ( from @xmath26 ) of the two stable @xmath23-periodic points that bifurcated from @xmath26 .",
    "then , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the ratio of the eigenvalues of @xmath30 .",
    "this universality can be explained rigorously if one shows that the _ renormalization _ operator @xmath31=\\lambda^{-1}_f \\circ f \\circ f \\circ \\lambda_f,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is some @xmath33-dependent coordinate transformation , has a fixed point , and the derivative of this operator is hyperbolic at this fixed point .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite that @xmath32 is a diagonal linear transformation .",
    "furthermore , such @xmath32 has been used in @xcite and @xcite in a computer assisted proof of existence of the renormalization fixed point .",
    "this is the strongest result to date concerning the existence of the renormalization fixed point .",
    "the problem has been further studied in @xcite , where the authors have demonstrated that the period doubling renormalization fixed point of @xcite is `` almost '' one dimensional , in the sense that it is close to the following hnon - like map : @xmath34 where @xmath35 solves @xmath36    @xcite also suggests an analytic approach to the full period doubling problem for area - preserving maps based on its proximity to the one dimensional .",
    "infinitely renormalizable maps , that is maps on the renormalization stable manifold , have been studied in @xcite and @xcite , where it has been shown that such maps ( in a codimension @xmath37 stable submanifold ) posses stable cantor sets ( sets on which the lyapunov exponents are equal to zero ) on which dynamics is rigid : the stable dynamics for two different infinitely renormalizable maps is conjugated by a @xmath38 transformation ( that is , a differentiable transformation whose derivative is hlder with exponent @xmath39 ) .",
    "this is in a stark contrast to the situation in dissipative hnon - like maps , where universality of cantor sets ( around the so called `` tip '' ) coexists with non - rigidity of the conjugacy of the dynamics on these sets ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the computer - assisted proof of @xcite can be described as an application of the contraction mapping principle for a newton map for the operator @xmath40 in some neighborhood in an appropriately chosen banach space .",
    "the proof is similar in spirit to the proofs @xcite of the feigenbaum - coullet - tresser universality by oscar lanford , and uses bounds for analytic functions ( not necessarily polynomials ) via the so called `` standard sets '' : loosely , generalizations of intervals in @xmath41 to infinite - dimensional functional spaces .",
    "such computer assisted proofs came to be called `` hard '' within the computational community .",
    "the approach turned out to be quite powerful , albeit rather specialized and time and effort consuming .    in this paper",
    "we study analyticity and compactness of the renormalization operator @xmath40 using , almost exclusively , the interval arithmetics in @xmath41 .",
    "we obtain a bound on the neighborhood of analyticity of the operator .",
    "specifically , we identify a low order polynomial approximation for the `` generating function '' of the fixed point map of @xmath40 , and estimate the radius of the neighborhood of analyticity of the renormalization operator , centered on this polynomial approximation in an appropriate banach space of functions analytic on a certain domain in @xmath42 .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that renormalizations of functions from this neighborhood of analyticity , are themselves functions , analytic on a larger domain in @xmath42 , which implies compactness of the renormalization operator .",
    "we achieve these two goals using only what can be termed as `` mild '' computer assistance : computer estimates on arithmetic operations on reals and on the square root function on reals , as well as norm estimates of low order ( quadratic ) polynomials .",
    "it is also our hope that the reader can find of interest several little `` tricks '' used in the paper to get bounds on solutions of functional equations .",
    "an `` area - preserving map '' will mean an exact symplectic diffeomorphism of a subset of @xmath0 onto its image .",
    "recall , that an area - preserving map @xmath43 can be uniquely specified by its generating function @xmath44 : @xmath45 if the equation @xmath46 has the unique solution @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , we will assume that @xmath33 is reversible , that is @xmath48    for such maps it follows from @xmath49 that @xmath50 and @xmath51    it is this `` little '' @xmath52 that will be referred to below as `` the generating function '' .",
    "applying a reversible @xmath33 twice we get @xmath53    it has been argued in @xcite that    @xmath54 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are some real parameters , dependent on @xmath33 .",
    "we therefore set @xmath55 , @xmath56 to obtain :    @xmath57    where @xmath58 solves @xmath59    if the solution of @xmath60 is unique , then @xmath61 , and it follows from @xmath62 that the generating function of the renormalized @xmath33 is given by @xmath63    furthermore , it is possible to fix some normalization conditions for @xmath64 and @xmath65 which serve to determine scalings @xmath15 and @xmath66 as functions of @xmath52 .",
    "notice , that the normalization @xmath67 is reproduced for @xmath64 as long as @xmath68    in particular , this implies that @xmath69    furthermore , the condition @xmath70 is reproduced as long as @xmath71    we will now summarize the above discussion in the following definition of the renormalization operator acting on generating functions originally due to the authors of @xcite :    [ ekw_def ] @xmath72(x , y)&=&\\gmu^{-1 } s(z(x , y),\\lambda y ) , { \\rm where}\\cr \\label{midpoint_eq } 0&=&s(\\lambda x , z(x , y))+s(\\lambda y , z(x , y ) ) , \\cr \\label{lambda - equation } 0&=&s(\\lambda,1)+s(0,1 ) \\quad { \\rm and } \\quad \\gmu=\\partial_1 z ( 1,0).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    [ b_space ] the banach space of functions @xmath73 , analytic on a bi - disk @xmath74 for which the norm @xmath75 is finite , will be referred to as @xmath76 .",

    "although analyticity and compactness of the renormalization operator have been already proved in @xcite ( together with a stronger result of existence of the fixed point ) , we would like to reiterate that the goal of the paper will be to obtain these results with a lighter machinery than that of @xcite .",
