    "the quantum mechanical description of neutrino oscillations  @xcite has been the subject of much discussion and debate in the recent literature .",

    "@xmath6 is derived on the assumption of equal momentum and equal production times of the two neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "other authors have proposed , instead , equal energies  @xcite or velocities  @xcite at production , confirming , in both cases , the result of the standard formula . the latter reference claims , however , that the standard expression for @xmath7 should be multiplied by a factor of two in the case of the equal energy or equal momentum hypotheses when different production times are allowed for the two mass eigenstates",
    ". however , the equal momentum , energy or velocity assumptions are all incompatible with energy - momentum conservation in the neutrino production process  @xcite .",
    "in two recent calculations  @xcite a covariant formalism was used in which exact energy - momentum conservation was imposed .",
    "these calculations used the invariant feynman propagator  @xcite to describe the space - time evolution of the neutrino mass eigenstates . in ref .",
    "@xcite a formula for the neutrino oscillation phase differing by a factor of 9.9 from eqn(1.1 ) was found for the case of pion decay at rest , and it was predicted that correlated spatial oscillations in the detection probability of neutrinos and the recoiling decay muons could be observed .",
    "however , the author of ref .",
    "@xcite as well as others  @xcite claimed that muon oscillations would either be completely suppressed , or essentially impossible to observe .",
    "the present paper calculates the probabilities of oscillation of neutrinos and muons produced by pions decaying both at rest and in flight , as well as the probabilities of neutrino oscillation following muon decay or @xmath8decay of a nucleus at rest .",
    "the calculations , which are fully covariant , are based on feynman s reformulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite in terms of interfering amplitudes associated with classical space - time particle trajectories . the essential interpretational formula of this approach , though motivated by the seminal paper of dirac on the lagrangian formulation of quantum mechanics  @xcite , and much developed later in the work of feynman and other authors  @xcite , was actually already given by heisenberg in 1930  @xcite .",
    "the application of the path amplitude formalism to neutrino or muon oscillations is particularly staightforward , since , in the covariant formulation of quantum mechanics , energy and momentum are exactly conserved at all vertices and due to the macroscopic propagation distances of the neutrinos and muons all these particles follow essentially classical trajectories ( _ i.e. _ corresponding to the minima of the classical action ) which are rectilinear paths with constant velocities .",
    "the essential formula of feynman s version of quantum mechanics , to be employed in the calculations presented below , is  @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the probability to observe a final state @xmath11 , given an initial state @xmath12 , and @xmath13 are ( unobserved ) intermediate quantum states . in the applications to be described in this paper , which , for simplicity , are limited to the case of the first two generations of leptons , eqn(1.2 ) specialises to : @xmath14 for the case of neutrino oscillations and @xmath15 for the case of muon oscillations .",
    "@xmath16 is the probability to observe the charged current neutrino interaction : @xmath17 following the decay : @xmath18 , while @xmath19 is the probability to observe the decay @xmath20 , after the same decay process . in eqns.(1.3),(1.4 ) @xmath21 are neutrino mass eigenstates while @xmath22 are the corresponding recoil muon states from pion decay .",
    "@xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 denote invariant decay amplitudes , @xmath26 is the invariant amplitude of the charged current neutrino interaction , @xmath27 is the invariant space - time propagator of particle @xmath28 between the space - time points @xmath29 and @xmath30 and @xmath31 is an invariant amplitude describing the production of the @xmath32 by the source @xmath33 and its space - time propagation to the space - time point @xmath34",
    ". an important feature of the amplitudes appearing in eqns(1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ) is that they are completely defined in terms of the physical neutrino mass eigenstate wavefunctions @xmath35 .",
    "this point will be further discussed in section 5 below .",
    "the difference of the approach used in the present paper to previous calculations presented in the literature can be seen immediately on inspection of eqns(1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ) .",
    "the initial state contributes only a multiplicative constant to the transition probabilites .",
    "the initial state can then just as well be defined as ` pion at @xmath34 ' , rather than @xmath36 .",
    "this is done in the calculations presented in section 2 below . ]",
    "is a pion at space time - point @xmath34 , the final state an @xmath37 or @xmath38 produced at space - time point @xmath39 . these are unique points , for any given event and do not depend in any way on the masses of the unobserved neutrino eigenstates propagating from @xmath40 to @xmath39 in eqn(1.3 ) .",
    "on the other hand the ( unobserved ) space - time points @xmath40 at which the neutrinos and muons are produced _ do _ depend on @xmath41 .",
    "indeed , because of the different velocities of the propagating neutrino eigenstates , only in this case can both neutrinos and muons ( representing _ alternative _ classical histories of the decaying pion ) both arrive simultanously at the unique point @xmath39 where the neutrino interaction occurs ( eqn(1.3 ) ) or the muon decays ( eqn(1.4 ) ) .",
    "the crucial point in the above discussion is that the decaying pion , _ via _ the different path amplitudes in eqns(1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ) , _ interferes with itself_. to modify very slightly dirac s famous statement : ` each pion then interferes only with itself .",
    "interference between two different pions never occurs ' .",
    "because of the different possible decay times of the pion in the two interfering path amplitudes , the pion propagators @xmath42 in eqns(1.3 ) and ( 1.4 ) above give important contributions to the interference phase . to the author s best knowledge ,",
    "this effect has not been taken into account in any previously published calculation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "the results found for the oscillation phase are , for pion decays at rest : @xmath43 and for pion decays in flight : @xmath44 where @xmath45 the superscripts indicate the particles whose propagators contribute to the interference phase .",
    "also @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the energies of the parent @xmath49 and the decay @xmath50 and @xmath51 and @xmath52 , @xmath53 the angles between the pion and the neutrino , muon flight directions . in eqns.(1.5 ) to ( 1.7 ) terms of order @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and higher , are neglected , and in eqns.(1.6 ) and ( 1.7 ) ultrarelativistic kinematics with @xmath56 is assumed .",
    "formulae for the oscillation phase of neutrino oscillations following muon decays or nuclear @xmath0-decays at rest , calculated in a similar manner to eqn(1.5 ) , are given in section 3 below .",
    "a brief comment is now made on the generality and the covariant nature of the calculations presented in this paper .",
    "although the fundamental formula ( 1.2 ) is valid in both relativistic and non - relativistic quantum mechanics , it was developed in detail by feynman  @xcite only for the non - relativistic case .",
    "for the conditions of the calculations performed in the present paper ( propagation of particles in free space ) the invariant space - time propagator can either be derived ( for fermions ) from the dirac equation , as originally done by feynman  @xcite or , more generally , from the covariant feynman path integral for an arbitary massive particle , as recently done in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the latter case ,",
    "the invariant propagator for any stable particle with pole mass @xmath57 , between space - time points @xmath58 and @xmath59 in free space is given by the path integral  @xcite : @xmath60 \\exp \\left \\",

    ", the hankel function reduces to an exponential and yields the configuration space propagator @xmath68 of eqn(2.11 ) below .",
    "it is also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that energy and momentum is exactly conserved in the interactions and decays of all such ` asymptotically propagating ' particles .",
    "the use of quasi - classical particle trajectories and the requirement of exact energy - momentum conservation are crucial ingredients of the calculations presented below .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the following section the case of neutrino or muon oscillations following pion decay at rest",
    "is treated .",
    "full account is taken of the momentum wave - packets of the progagating neutrinos and muons resulting from the breit - wigner amplitudes describing the distributions of the physical masses of the decaying pion and daughter muon .",
    "the corresponding oscillation damping corrections and phase shifts are found to be very small , indicating that the quasi - classical ( constant velocity ) approximation used to describe the neutrino and muon trajectories is a very good one .",
    "the incoherent effects , of random thermal motion of the source pion , and of finite source and detector sizes , on the oscillation probabilities and the oscillation phases , are also calculated .",
    "these corrections are found to be small in typical experiments , but much larger than those generated by the coherent momentum wave packets . in section 3 , formulae are derived to describe neutrino oscillations following muon decay at rest or the @xmath0-decay of radioactive nuclei .",
    "these are written down by direct analogy with those derived in the previous section for pion decay at rest . in section 4 ,",
    "the case of neutrino and muon oscillations following pion decay in flight is treated . in this case",
    "the two - dimensional spatial geometry of the particle trajectories must be related to the decay kinematics of the production process . due to the non - applicability of the ultrarelativistic approximation to the kinematics of the muon in the pion rest frame , the calculation , although straightforward , is rather tedious and lengthy for the case of muon oscillations , so the details are relegated to an appendix .",
    "finally , in section 5 , the positive aspects and shortcomings of previous treatments in the literature of the quantum mechanics of neutrino and muon oscillations are discussed in comparison with the method and results of the present paper .",
    "to understand clearly the different physical hypotheses and approximations underlying the calculation of the particle oscillation effects it is convenient to analyse a precise experiment .",
    "this ideal experiment is , however , very similar to lnsd  @xcite and karmen  @xcite except that neutrinos are produced from pion , rather than muon , decay at rest .",
    "the different space - time events that must be considered in order to construct the probability amplitudes for the case of neutrino oscillations following pion decay at rest are shown in fig.1 .",
    "a @xmath32 passes through the counter c@xmath69 , where the time @xmath70 is recorded , and comes to rest in a thin stopping target t ( fig.1a ) ) . for simplicity ,",
    "the case of only two neutrino mass eigenstates @xmath71 and @xmath72 of masses @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( @xmath3 @xmath73 @xmath4 ) is considered .",
    "the pion at rest constitutes the initial state of the quantum mechanical probability amplitudes .",
    "the final state is an @xmath74 system produced , at time @xmath75 , via the process @xmath76 at a distance @xmath2 from the decaying @xmath32 ( fig.1d ) ) .",
    "two different physical processes may produce the observed @xmath74 final state , as shown in fig.1b ) and 1c ) , where the pion decays either at time @xmath77 into @xmath71 or at time @xmath78 into @xmath72 .",
    "the probability amplitudes for these processes are , up to an arbitary normalisation constant , and neglecting solid angle factors in the propagators : @xmath79 note that following the conventional ` @xmath80 ' ( final , initial ) ordering of the indices of matrix elements in quantum mechanics , the path amplitude is written from right to left in order of increasing time .",
    "this ensures also correct matching of ` bra ' and ` ket ' symbols in the amplitudes . in eqn(2.1 ) , @xmath81 , @xmath82 are ` reduced ' invariant amplitudes of the @xmath50 charged current scattering and pion decay processes , respectively , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , @xmath86 are relativistic breit - wigner amplitudes , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are elements of the unitary maki - nagagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix  @xcite , @xmath89 , describing the charged current coupling of a charged lepton , @xmath90 , ( @xmath91 ) to the neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath12 .",
    "the reduced invariant amplitudes are defined by factoring out the mns matrix element from the amplitude for the process .",
    "for example : @xmath92 . since the purely kinematical effects of the non - vanishing neutrino masses are expected to be very small , the reduced matrix elements may be assumed to be lepton flavour independent : @xmath93 where @xmath94 denotes a massless neutrino . in eqn(2.1 ) , @xmath95 is the lorentz - invariant configuration space propagator  @xcite of the pion or neutrino .",
    "the pole masses and total decay widths of the pion and muon are denoted by @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , @xmath99 respectively . for simplicity ,",
    "phase space factors accounting for different observed final states are omitted in eqn(2.1 ) and subsequent formulae .    because the amplitudes and propagators in eqn(2.1 ) are calculated using relativistic quantum field theory , and the neutrinos propagate over macroscopic distances , it is a good approximation , as already discussed in the previous section , to assume exact energy - momentum conservation in the pion decay process , and that the neutrinos are on their mass shells , _ i.e. _ @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the neutrino energy - momentum four - vector . in these circumstances",
    "the neutrino propagators correspond to classical , rectilinear , particle trajectories .",
    "the pion and muon are unstable particles whose physical masses @xmath102 and @xmath103 differ from the pole masses @xmath104 and @xmath98 appearing in the breit - wigner amplitudes and covariant space - time propagators in eqn(2.1 )",

    "however , since the pion decays resulting in the production of @xmath71 and @xmath72 are independent physical processes , the physical masses of the unobserved muons , @xmath107 , recoiling against the two neutrino mass eigenstates are not , in general , the same . in the following kinematical calculations sufficient accuracy",
    "is achieved by retaining only quadratic terms in the neutrino masses , and terms linear in the small quantities : @xmath108 , @xmath109 .",
    "this allows simplification of the relativistic breit - wigner amplitudes : @xmath110 developing eqn(2.2 ) up to first order in @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 yields the relation : @xmath114   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath115 the term @xmath116 which is also included in eqn(2.4 ) gives a negligible o(@xmath117 ) contribution to the neutrino oscillation formula . for muon oscillations ,",
    "however , it gives a term of o(@xmath111 ) in the interference term , as discussed below .",
    "similarly , the exact formula for the neutrino energy : @xmath118 in combination with eqn(2.4 ) gives , for the neutrino velocity : @xmath119~+~o(m_i^4,\\delta_{\\pi}^2,\\delta_i^2)\\ ] ] this formula will be used below to calculate the neutrino times - of - flight : @xmath120 .    from the unitarity of the mns matrix",

    "after the substitution ( 2.21 ) , the integral over @xmath112 in eqn(2.16 ) is easily evaluated by a change of variable to ` complete the square ' in the argument of the exponential , with the result : @xmath147\\ ] ] eqn(2.18 ) gives , for @xmath148 , the numerical value : @xmath149 for typical physically interesting values ( see below ) of @xmath150 ev and @xmath151 m , @xmath148 takes the value 0.48 mev@xmath152 , so that @xmath153 then , to very good accuracy , @xmath154 , independently of the neutrino mass .",

    "this implies that the neutrino of mass @xmath3 results from an earlier decay than the neutrino of mass @xmath4 , in order to be detected at the same time . because of the exponential decrease with time of the pion decay amplitude , the contribution to the probability of the squared amplitude for the neutrino of mass @xmath3 is larger .",
    "the interference term resulting from the product of the decay amplitudes of the two neutrinos of different mass , has an exponential factor that is the harmonic mean of those of the squared amplitudes for each neutrino mass eigenstate , and so is also suppressed relative to the squared amplitude for the neutrino of mass @xmath3 .",
    "the integral over the physical pion mass is readily performed by replacing the breit - wigner function by a gaussian as in eqn(2.21 ) .",

    "on integrating over @xmath75 , the squared amplitude terms give equal contributions , the larger amplitude for mass @xmath3 being exactly compensated by a smaller range of integration . the exponential damping factor in the interference term in eqn(2.26 ) is derived using the relations : @xmath167 and @xmath168 to obtain @xmath169 the damping factor arises because the difference in the times - of - flight of the two neutrino paths is limited by the pion lifetime .",
    "it will be seen below , however , that for distances @xmath2 of practical interest for the observation of neutrino oscillations , the damping effect is tiny .",
    "the part of the oscillation phase in eqn(2.24 ) originating from the neutrino propagators ( the term associated with the ` 1 ' within the large curved brackets ) differs by a factor two from the corresponding expression in the standard formula .",

    "if the target in which the pion stops is of thickness @xmath192 , then the effect of different stopping points of the @xmath49 ( assumed uniformly distributed ) is to multiply the interference term in ( 2.26 ) by the factor : @xmath193 if the position of the neutrino interaction point within the target has an uncertainy of @xmath194 a similar correction factor is found , with the replacement @xmath195 in eqn(2.34 ) .",
    "the calculation of this correction factor is also described in appendix a.    if the target t in which the pion comes to rest ( fig.1a ) ) is chosen to be sufficiently thin , the pion decay process may be detected by observing the recoil muon in the counter c@xmath69 at times @xmath77 or @xmath78 ( fig.1b ) or 1c ) ) .",

    "the damping factor @xmath377 is typically interpreted  @xcite in terms of the ` heisenberg uncertainty principle ' .",
    "this factor is small , unless the difference in mass of the eigenstates is much less than @xmath378 , so it is argued that only for wide momentum wave packets can neutrino oscillations be observed , whereas in the contrary case , when the mass eigenstates are distinguishable , the interference effect vanishes . in the case of pion decay",
    "the difference in momentum of the two interfering mass eigenstates comes only from the @xmath112 term in eqn(2.4 ) , as @xmath113 , being a property of the common initial state , is the same for both eigenstates .",
    "the neutrino momentum smearing in pion decay is then estimated from eqn(2.4 ) as : @xmath379 for @xmath380 the value of @xmath377 is found to be @xmath381 giving complete suppression of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this prediction is in clear contradiction with the tiny damping corrections found in the path amplitude analysis in of section 2 above .    the preceding discussion of the derivation of the standard formula for the oscillation phase ( 1.1 ) in terms of ` flavour eigenstates ' revealed contradictions and inconsistencies if the neutrinos are assumed to follow classical space - time trajectories .",
    "the ` source wave packet ' treatment gives the standard result for the oscillation phase and predicts that the interference term will be more or less damped depending on the widths in space - time and momentum space of the wave packets .",

    "are the packets actually constrained by the heisenberg uncertainty relations ?",

    "the answers to all these questions are contained in the results of the calculations presented in section 2 above .",

    "this pion , being an unstable particle , has a mass @xmath102 that is , in general , different from its most likely value which is the pole mass @xmath96 .",
    "what are shown in fig.1b ) and fig.1c ) are two different classical histories of this _ very same pion_. in b ) it decays into the neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath71 at time @xmath77 , and in c ) it decays into the neutrino mass eigenstate @xmath72 at time @xmath78 . because these are independent classical histories , the physical masses , @xmath382 and @xmath383 , of the muons recoiling against the mass eigenstates @xmath71 and @xmath72 , respectively , are , in general , not equal . taking into account , now , exact energy - momentum conservation in the decay processes ( appropriate because of the covariant formulation used throughout ) the eigenstates @xmath71 and @xmath72 will have momenta which depend on @xmath102 and @xmath382 and @xmath102 and @xmath383 respectively .",
    "these momenta are calculated in eqn(2.4 ) .",
    "the distributions of @xmath102 and @xmath103 are determined by breit - wigner amplitudes ( that are the fourier transforms of the corresponding exponential decay laws ) in terms of the decay widths @xmath97 and @xmath99 respectively . in accordance with eqn(1.2 ) , only the breit - wigner amplitudes corresponding to the physical muon masses are ( coherently ) integrated over at the amplitude level .",
    "the integral over @xmath102 ( a property of the initial state ) is performed ( incoherently ) at the level of the transition probability . because of the long lifetimes of the @xmath49 and @xmath51 , the corresponding momentum wave packets are very narrow , so that all corrections resulting from integration over the resulting momentum spectra are found to give vanishingly small corrections .",
    "indeed , as is evident from the discussion of eqn(5.10 ) above , the width of the momentum wave packet is much smaller than the difference in the momenta of the eigenstates expected for experimentally interesting values of the neutrino mass difference ( say , @xmath384 ) .",
    "contrary to the prediction of eqn(5.10 ) , this does not at all prevent the observation of neutrino oscillations .",
    "this is because the oscillations result from interference between amplitudes corresponding to different propagation times , not different momenta , of the neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "table 1 shows contributions to the fractional smearing of the neutrino momentum from different sources :    * neutrino mass difference @xmath384 ( eqn(2.4 ) ) * coherent effect due to the physical muon mass ( @xmath385 in eqn(2.4 ) ) * incoherent effect due to the physical pion mass ( @xmath386 in eqn(2.4 ) ) * incoherent doppler effect assuming @xmath387    the pion mass effect is of the same order of magnitude as the neutrino mass shift .",
    "the muon mass effect is two orders of magnitude smaller , while the doppler effect at room temperature gives a shift eleven orders of magnitude larger than a ( 1ev)@xmath199 neutrino mass difference squared .",
    "according to the usual interpretation of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , the neutrinos from pion decay , which , as has been shown above , correspond to very narrow momentum wave packets , would be expected to have a very large spatial uncertainty . indeed , interpreting the width of the coherent momentum wave packet generated by the spread in @xmath388 according to the the momentum - space uncertainty relation @xmath389 gives @xmath390 km .",
    "does this accurately represent the knowledge of the position of a decay neutrino obtainable in the experiment shown in fig.1 ? without any experimental difficulty , the decay time of the pion can be measured with a precision of @xmath391sec , by detecting the decay muon .",
    "thus , at any later time , the distance of the neutrino from the decay point is known with a precision of @xmath392 cm .",
    "this is a factor 4@xmath393 more precise than the ` uncertainty ' given by the heisenberg relation .",
    "it is clear that the experimental knowledge obtainable on the position of the neutrino is essentially classical , in agreement with the theoretical description in terms of classical particle trajectories in space - time . in this case",
    "the momentum - position uncertainty relation evidently does not reflect the possible experimental knowledge of the position and momentum of the neutrino .",
    "this is because it does not take into account the prior knowledge that the mass of the neutrino is much less than that of the pion or muon , so that its velocity is , with negligible uncertainty , c. in spite of this , a heisenberg uncertainty relation is indeed respected in the pion decay process .",
    "the breit - wigner amplitude that determines the coherent spread of neutrino momentum is just the fourier transform of the exponential decay law of the muon .",
    "the width parameter of the breit - wigner amplitude and the muon mean lifetime do indeed respect the _ energy - time _",
    "uncertainty relation @xmath394 .",
    "it is then clear , from this careful analysis of neutrino oscillations following pion decay at rest , that , in contradiction to what has been almost universally assumed until now , _",
    "the neutrinos are not described by a coherent spatial wave packet_. there is a coherent momentum wave packet , but it is only a kinematical consequence of a breit wigner amplitude . if for mathematical convenience",
    ", the momentum wave packet is represented by a gaussian , a conjugate ( and spurious ) gaussian spatial wave packet will be generated by fourier transformation .",
    "indeed , in the majority of wave packet treatments that have appeared in the literature , gaussian momentum and spatial wave packets related by a fourier transform with widths satisfying the ` uncertainty relation ' @xmath395 have been introduced .",
    "in fact , it is evident , by inspection , that the space - time wavepacket of eqn(5.10 ) does not correctly reflect the known space - time structure of the sequence of events corresponding to pion decay .",
    "since @xmath364 , the fixed source - detector distance , the integral of @xmath134 over the range from @xmath396 to @xmath397 assumed in order to derive eqn(5.12 ) implies that the neutrino velocities @xmath398 vary also in the range : @xmath399 .",
    "this unphysical range of integration results in an average neutrino momentum that is less than the kinematical velocity , @xmath352 , of either mass eigenstate , due to contributions to the integral from negative values of @xmath134  @xcite .",
    "also the production time dependence is known to be exponential , not gaussian .",
    "there are indeed ` heisenberg uncertainties ' in the production times of the neutrinos , due to the finite source lifetime , but once the neutrinos are produced their motion in space - time is well approximated , in each alternative history , by that of a free classical particle .",
    "the above discussion shows clearly that the _ ad hoc _ gaussian wave packet introduced in eqns(5.8 ) and ( 5.9 ) does not correspond to the actual sequence of the space - time events that constitute realistic neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the limitation on the detection distance @xmath2 , for observation of neutrino oscillations , given by the damping factor @xmath400 of eqn(2.30 ) is easily understood in terms of the classical particle trajectories shown in fig.1 . for a given velocity difference , the time difference @xmath401 becomes very large when both neutrinos , in the alternative classical histories , are required to arrive simultaneously at a far distant detector . because of the finite pion lifetime , however , the amplitude for pion decay at time @xmath78 is smaller than that at @xmath77 by the factor @xmath402 $ ] . integrating over all decay times results in the exponential damping factor @xmath400 of eqn(2.30 ) .",
    "it is clear that , contrary to the damping factor @xmath371 of eqn(5.14 ) , the physical origin of the @xmath2 dependent damping factor is quite unrelated to ` wavepacket overlap ' .    for a given value of @xmath401 the coherent neutrino momentum spread originating in the breit wigner amplitude for @xmath388",
    "produces a corresponding velocity smearing that reduces the number of possible classical trajectories arriving at the detection event .",
    "this effect is taken into account in the integral shown in eqn(2.22 ) .",
    "the effect is shown , in section 2 above , to be much smaller than the ( already tiny ) pion lifetime damping described above , and it is neglected in eqn(2.26 ) . as described by eqn(2.25 ) , the ( incoherent ) integration over the breit wigner function containing @xmath102 gives an additional damping correction to the interference term that is also very tiny compared to that due to the pion lifetime .    a final remark is now made on the physical interpretation of the damping factors ( 5.13 ) and ( 5.14 ) that have often been derived and discussed in the literature .",
    "@xmath371 is replaced , in the path amplitude calculations , by @xmath400 and @xmath377 by the factor resulting from the coherent integration over the physical muon mass @xmath388 .",
    "the reason for the huge suppression factor predicted by eqn(5.13 ) , and the tiny one found in the path amplitude calculation , is that , in deriving ( 5.13 ) and ( 5.14 ) , it is assumed that the neutrino eigenstates are both produced and detected at equal times .",
    "this will only be possible if both the hypothetical ` wave packet overlap ' is appreciable ( eqn(5.14 ) ) and also the momentum smearing is sufficiently large that the time - of - flight differences due to the different neutrino masses are washed out ( eqn(5.13 ) . in the path amplitude calculation interference and hence oscillations are made possible by different _ decay times _ of the source pion , and the damping factors analagous to @xmath371 and @xmath377 turn out to give vanishingly small corrections to the oscillation term .",
    "it may be remarked that the physical interpretation of ` neutrino oscillations ' provided by the path amplitude description is different from the conventional one in terms of ` flavour eigenstates ' . in the latter the amplitudes of different flavours in the neutrino",
    "are supposed to vary harmonically as a function of time .",
    "this may be done , for example , by changing the basis states , in eqn(5.3 ) above , from the mass to the flavour basis by using the inverses of eqns(5.2 ) and ( 5.4 ) . in the amplitudes for the different physical processes in the path amplitude treatment",
    "there is , instead , no variation of the ` lepton flavour ' in the propagating neutrinos . if the mass eigenstates are represented as superpositions of `",
    "lepton flavour eigenstates ' there is evidently no temporal variation of the lepton flavour composition within each interfering amplitude .",
    "indeed , the neutrinos in general occupy different spatial positions at any given time , making it impossible to project out a ` flavour eigenstate ' at any time by using the inverses of eqns(5.2 ) and ( 5.4 ) . only _ in the detection process itself _ where the different neutrino histories occupy the same space time point are the ` lepton flavour eigenstates ' projected out , and the interference effect occurs that is described as ` neutrino oscillations ' . in the case of the observation of decay products of the recoil muons",
    "no such projection on to a ` lepton flavour eigenstate ' takes place , but exactly similar interference effects are predicted to occur . as previously emphasised  @xcite ,",
    "the ` flavour oscillations ' of neutrinos , neutral kaons and b - mesons are just special examples of the universal phenomenon of quantum mechanical superposition described by eqn(1.2 ) , that also describes all the interference effects of physical optics .      by far",
    "the most widespread difference from the path amplitude treatment of the present paper is the non - respect of the basic quantum mechanical formula , ( 1.2 ) , by the introduction of wave packets to describe ` source ' and/or ` detector ' particles[7,8,10,11,30 - 46 ] . since in any practical neutrino oscillation experiment a single initial or final quantum state , as specified by eqn(1.2 ) , is not defined , but rather sets of initial and final states @xmath403 and @xmath404 determined by experimental conditions , eqn(1.2 ) may be generalised to : @xmath405 to be contrasted with the formula used in the references cited above : @xmath406 here , @xmath407 and @xmath408 are ` source ' and ` detector ' wave packets respectively . in eqn(5.17 )",
    "the initial states @xmath409 and final states @xmath410 of eqn(5.16 ) , that correspond to different spatial positions , and also , possibly , different kinematic properties , of the source particle or detection event , are convoluted with _ ad hoc _ spatial and/or temporal ` wave packets ' , that are , in the opinion of the present writer , for the reasons given above , devoid of any physical significance .    a possible reason for the widespread use of eqn(5.17 ) instead of ( 5.16 )",
    "may be understood following a remark of the author of ref .",
    "@xcite concerning a ` paradox ' of the complete quantum field theory calculation that takes into account , by a single invariant amplitude , production , propagation and detection of the neutrinos .",
    "it was noticed that , if the amplitude for the complete chain of processes is considered to correspond to one big feynman diagram , then integration over the space - time coordinates of the initial and final states particles will reduce the exponential factors , containing the essential information on the interference phase , to energy - momentum conserving delta functions , and so no oscillations will be possible .",
    "a related remark was made by the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite who stated that , as they were assuming exact energy - momentum conservation , the integration over the space - time coordinates could be omitted .",
    "they still , however , ( quite inconsistently , in view of the previous remark ) retained the exponential factors containing the interference phase information .",
    "these considerations indicate a general confusion between momentum space feynman diagram calculations , where it is indeed legitimate to integrate , at the amplitude level , over the unobserved space - time positions of the initial and final state particles , and the case of neutrino oscillations , where the amplitude is defined with initial and final states corresponding to space - time positions . in the latter case ,",
    "it is the unobserved momenta of the propagating particles that should be integrated over , as is done in eqns(2.1 ) and ( 2.35 ) above , and not the space - time positions of the ` source ' or ` detector ' particles , as in eqn(5.17 ) .",
    "it is clear that exact energy - momentum conservation plays a crucial role in the path amplitude calculation .",
    "this is valid only in a fully covariant theory .",
    "still , several authors , in spite of the ultra - relativistic nature of neutrinos , used a non - relativistic theory to describe the production , propagation and detection of neutrinos  @xcite . as is well known , in such ` old fashioned perturbation theory '  @xcite energy is not conserved at the level of propagators and so no precise analysis of the kinematics and the space - time configurations of the production and detection events , essential in the covariant path amplitude analysis , is possible .",
    "even when , in some cases , the complete production , propagation and detection process of the neutrinos were described  @xcite , equal neutrino energies  @xcite , equal neutrino momenta  @xcite or either  @xcite were assumed , in contradiction with energy - momentum conservation and a consistent space - time description of the production and detection events . as follows",
    "directly from eqn(5.6 ) ( or the similar formula , for the neutrino momentum , obtained by assuming equal neutrino energies ) , the standard formula ( 1.1 ) for the oscillation phase was obtained in all the above cited references .",
    "as shown in reference  @xcite this is a consequence of the universal equal production time ( or equal velocity ) hypothesis .",
    "in fact , the assumptions of equal momenta , equal energies or exact energy - momentum conservation give only negligible , o(@xmath411 ) , changes in the oscillation phase  @xcite .",
    "an interesting discussion of the interplay between different kinematical assumptions ( not respecting energy - momentum conservation ) and the space - time description of the production and detection events was provided in ref .",
    "this treatment was based on the lorentz - invariant propagator phase of eqn(2.11 ) . by assuming either equal momentum or equal energy for the propagating neutrinos , but allowing _ different times of propagation _ for the two mass eigenstates , values of @xmath412 agreeing with eqns(2.14 ) and ( 2.24 ) above",
    "were found , _",
    "i.e. _ differing by a factor two from the standard formula .",
    "alteratively , assuming equal velocities , ( and hence equal propagation times ) the standard result ( 1.1 ) was obtained . in this latter case , however , the masses , momenta and energies of the neutrinos must be related , up to corrections of o(@xmath111 ) , according to : @xmath413 since the ratio of the neutrino masses may take , in general , any value , so must then the ratio of their momenta . for the case of neutrino production from pion decay at rest with @xmath414",

    "thus , velocity smearing effects are expected to play an important role in @xmath443 oscillations .",
    "this is possible , since the neutral b - meson decay width ( @xmath449 mev ) , and mass difference ( @xmath450 mev ) , have similar sizes .    in closing ,",
    "it is interesting to mention two types of atomic physics experiments where interference effects similar to the conjectured ( and perhaps observed  @xcite ) neutrino oscillations have aleady been clearly seen .",
    "the first is quantum beat spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "this type of experiment , which has previously been discussed in connection with neutrino oscillations  @xcite , corresponds closely to the gedanken experiment used by heisenberg  @xcite to exemplify the the fundamental law of quantum mechanics , eqn(1.2 ) .",
    "the atoms of an atomic beam are excited by passage through a thin foil or a laser beam .",
    "the quantum phase of an atom with excitation energy @xmath274 evolves with time according to : @xmath451 ( see the discussion after eqn(3.3 ) above ) .",
    "if decay photons from two nearby states with excitation energies @xmath452 and @xmath453 are detected after a time interval @xmath134 ( for example by placing a photon detector beside the beam at a variable distance @xmath454 from the excitation foil ) a cosine interference term with phase : @xmath455 where @xmath456 is the average velocity of the atoms in the beam , is observed  @xcite .",
    "an atom in the beam , before excitation , corresponds to the neutrino source pion .",
    "the excitation process corresponds to the decay of the pion .",
    "the propagation of the two different excited states , _ alternative _ histories of the initial atom , correspond to the _ alternative _ propagation of the two neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "finally the dexcitation of the atoms and the detection of a _ single _ photon corresponds to the neutrino detection process .",
    "the particular importance of this experiment for the path amplitude calculations presented in the present paper , is that it demonstrates , experimentally , the important contribution to the interference phase of the space - time propagators of excited atoms , in direct analogy to the similar contributions of unstable pions , muons and nuclei discussed above .    an even closer analogy to neutrino osillations following pion decay is provided by the recently observed process of photodetachement of an electron by laser excitation : the ` photodetachment microscope '  @xcite .",
    "a laser photon ejects the electron from , for example , an @xmath457 ion in a beam .",
    "the photodetached electron is emitted in an s - wave ( isotropically ) and with a fixed initial energy .",
    "it then moves in a constant , vertical , electric field that is perpendicular to the direction of the ion beam and almost parallel to the laser beam .",
    "an upward moving electron that is decelerated by the field eventually undergoes ` reflection ' before being accelerated towards a planar position - sensitive electron detector situated below the beam and perpendicular to the electric field direction ( see fig.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in these circumstances",
    ", it can be shown  @xcite that , just two classical electron trajectories link the production point to any point in the kinematically allowed region of the detection plane .",
    "typical parameters for @xmath457 are  @xcite : initial electron kinetic energy , 102 @xmath51ev : detector distance , 51.4 cm ; average time - of - flight , 117 ns ; difference in emission times for the electrons to arrive in spatial - temporal coincidence at the detector plane , 160 ps .",
    "an interference pattern is generated by the phase difference between the amplitudes corresponding to the two allowed trajectories .",
    "the phase difference , derived by performing the feynman path integral of the classical action along the classical trajectories  @xcite , gives a very good description of the observed interference pattern .",
    "the extremely close analogy between this experiment and the neutrino oscillation experiments described in sections 2 and 3 above is evident .",
    "notice that the neutrinos , like the electrons in the photodetachement experiment , must be emitted at different times , in the alternative paths , for interference to be possible .",
    "this is the crucial point that was not understood in all previous treatments of the quantum mechanics of neutrino oscillations .",
    "actually , ref .",
    "@xcite contains , in section iv , a path amplitude calculation for electrons in free space that is geometrically identical to the discussion of pion decays in flight presented in section 4 above ( compare fig.3 of the present paper with fig.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite is that , in this case , no interference effects are possible for electrons that are mononergetic in the source rest frame . as is shown in section 4 above ,",
    "if these electrons are replaced either by neutrinos of different masses from pion decay , or muons recoiling against such neutrinos , observable interference effects are indeed to be expected .",
    "random thermal motion of the decaying pion in the target has two distinct physical effects on the phase of neutrino oscillations ,   @xmath458 ( where the first and second terms in eqn(a1 ) give the contributions of the neutrino and pion paths respectively ) :    * the observed neutrino momentum , @xmath459 , is no longer equal to @xmath460 , due to the boost from the pion rest frame to the laboratory system .",
    "( doppler effect or lorentz boost ) * the time increment of the pion path @xmath461 ( see eqn(2.16 ) ) no longer corresponds to the pion proper time .",
    "( relativistic time dilatation )    taking into account ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) gives , for the neutrino oscillation phase :   @xmath462 where : @xmath463 here , @xmath464 is the angle between the neutrino momentum vector and the pion flight direction in the pion rest frame .",
