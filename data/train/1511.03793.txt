    "such study of localization has its applications in the exploration of properties of low dimensional materials , i.e. , anderson localization  @xcite , and the understanding of the building quantum walk algorithms and quantum computations  @xcite , etc .",

    "moreover , by modifying the phase of the positions of the qrw , we can localize the particle in some certain positions , and the probability distribution for the different positions of the qrw displays a periodical behavior with time  @xcite .",
    "recent researches illustrated that when only the phase of the original position of the qrw is modified ( it means that only one single phase defect is introduced at the original position ) , one will obtain a sharp allocation of distribution for this particular position in our qrw at the infinite time  @xcite .",

    "our results reveal that , when the defect is introduced into any position of the qrw , the localization of the probability distribution will appear with our chosen initial state .",

    "we find that , at the position where the defect occupies , the amplitude of the probability distribution of this qrw exhibits the non - monotonic increase with the increase of the parameter @xmath3 of the coin operator @xmath4 , while in comparison , the probability of occupying the defect s position at @xmath1 or @xmath2 shows a linear increase with the parameter @xmath3  @xcite .",
