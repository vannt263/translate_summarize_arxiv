    "the orion nebula is the defining blister region ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "a star cluster ionizes the skin of the molecular cloud , causing an expansion away from the molecular cloud towards us .",
    "the region is in photoionization equilibrium with a density in concert with that of the background photodissociation region ( @xcite ) , and both regions are dusty with high depletions of the refractory elements ( @xcite ) .",
    "bautista , pradhan , & osterbrock ( 1994 ; hereafter bpo ) , bautista & pradhan ( 1995 ; hereafter bp95 ) , and bautista , peng , & pradhan ( 1996 ; hereafter bpp ) have recently suggested that [ ] and [ ] lines are produced by a warm ( @xmath2  k ) region with very high electron density ( @xmath3  @xmath1 ) and a solar iron abundance .",
    "this would be surprising for such a dusty environment , but would have important implications for grain destruction mechanisms . here",
    "we use better spectroscopic data and new photoionization calculations to reexamine these claims .",
    "bp95 s claims were based in part on their analysis of the [ ] intensities reported by osterbrock , tran , & veilleux ( 1992 ; hereafter otv ) and baldwin et al .",
    "( 1991 ; hereafter bfm ) . in these low - resolution spectra the orion [ ] lines",
    "were completely blended with the telluric emission which varies with time and position on the sky . in the case of [ ] 5577 , the telluric emission is much stronger than nebular emission , and no careful subtraction could yield an accurate measurement of this line .",
    "both bfm and otv assigned large uncertainties to their measurement of [ ] 6300 , and did not claim any significant measurement of [ ] 5577 .",
    "we have two sets of observations which dramatically improve on these measurements .",
    "first , we used the faint object spectrograph on the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ with the 0.86 circular aperture and the g570h grating on 1995 october 23/24 ( ut ) .",
    "we made 225  s integrations at positions 1sw ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) = ( @xmath6 , 05@xmath723415 ) and x2 ( @xmath8 , 05@xmath723575 ) , roughly 30 wsw and s , respectively , from @xmath9 ori c. the summed spectrum is presented in figure 1 .",
    "line strengths were measured with gaussian fits to the profiles and are presented in table 1 where they are given relative to 6678 and are uncorrected for interstellar extinction .",
    "we note that the _ hst _ spectra are not affected by telluric emission .",
    "the diode glitch between [ ] 5538 and [ ] 5577 in the flat fields does not impact our analysis .",
    "also , a spectrum was taken with the cassegrain echelle spectrograph on the 4 m blanco telescope at ctio , on 12 january 1996 .",
    "this provided an 11  km  s@xmath10 resolution spectrum at a time when the earth s motion split the nebular lines from the telluric emission .",
    "the spectra were extracted over a slit width of 1 and length of 12.5 , centered on the bfm position 1 at 37 w of @xmath9 ori c. the line intensities are in table 1 and parts of the spectra are shown in figure 1 .",
    "orion has a spectrum with a strong point to point variation ( e.g. , @xcite ) causing the differences in the two spectra .",
    "the ctio spectrum at the bfm position has the higher ionization .",
    "the @xmath11 spectrum is similar to that reported by otv for another position in the nebula .",
    "table 2 gives reddening corrected intensities relative to h@xmath12 , using bfm s extinction for the ctio data ; for our _ hst _ data , we adopt c(h@xmath13 from the composite h@xmath14/h@xmath12 ratio .",
    "the ctio data in table 2 were renormalized using the 6678/h@xmath12 intensity ratio reported by bfm .",
    "limits to the [ ] ratio @xmath15 are needed to set @xmath16 for an assumed @xmath17 . in neither spectrum was [ ] 5577 detected , but we have obtained a much stricter upper limit .",
    "the observed limits are @xmath18 ( ctio ) and @xmath19 ( _ hst _ ) and the reddening corrected ratios are @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the superior spectral resolution is the primary reason the ctio spectrum has the more stringent limit .",
    "this limit is very different from the ratio of 22 adopted by bp95 , and shows that warm dense gas does not contribute to the [ ] spectrum .",
    "the ctio [ ] 6716/6731 ratio ( 0.53 ) indicates a @xmath17-insensitive density of @xmath22  @xmath1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the [ ] 5755/6583 ratio ( 0.018 ) indicates @xmath17 of 10,100  k , fairly independent of @xmath16 in this range .",
    "hst_-derived properties are similar . assuming @xmath23  k , the ctio [ ] ratio limit sets the limit @xmath24  @xmath1 , consistent with the @xmath16 [ ] and much lower than the density deduced by bp95 . assuming @xmath16 [ ] , we find that the [ ] ratio limit sets the limit @xmath25  k , consistent with the [ ] spectrum .",
    "these are all conventional orion region numbers ; we conclude that the [ ] spectrum is consistent with its formation in gas of moderate density ( @xmath26  @xmath1 ) .",
    "the photoionization calculations presented below predict the [ ] ratio to be @xmath27 .",
    "table 3 shows the observed ( extinction corrected ) [ ] line ratios from otv and lowe et al .",
    "( 1979 ) and some predictions .",
    "the claim by bpo that the [ ] lines come from a high - density region in orion is based on a collisional model of the atom , which reproduces the observed optical to near - infrared line ratios at density @xmath28  @xmath1 .",
    "table 3 shows the collisional model reproduced from table 2 of bpp ( @xmath29  @xmath1 and @xmath30  k , using new collision strengths described by bautista & pradhan 1996 , hereafter bp96 ) .",
    "the predictions of the collisional model are sensitive to the adopted collision strengths .",
    "our model  i recalculates the line ratios for the same collisional model , using the publicly available collisional data from zhang & pradhan ( 1995 ; hereafter zp ) also used in our photoionization models below .",
    "this shows that the lines 4815 , 5159 , 5262 , and 5334 are stronger by a factor of two than in the bp96-based model in bpp because of different collision strengths .",
    "also shown in table 3 are line ratios we calculated for a density more typical of standard orion models , @xmath31  @xmath1 ( model ii ) . at this density , there is clearly a requirement for some mechanism other than simply collisions to populate the upper levels of the that produce the optical lines .",
    "the alternative to collisional excitation , pumping of [ ] lines by the incident continuum , was considered by bpp ( see also lucy 1995 ) .",
    "the equation used by bpp is correct in the optically thin limit .",
    "however , the ultraviolet lines dominating the pumping are usually optically thick and line self - shielding must be included if energy is to be conserved ( ferland 1992 ) .",
    "the correct formulation of the constant temperature problem outlined in bpp should include the column density as an additional free parameter .",
    "to model the production of the [ ] lines more realistically , we incorporated a 371 level model atom into cloudy ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "collision data for our model atom are from zp , radiative data mainly from quinet , le dourneuf , & zeippen ( 1996 ) and nahar ( 1995 ) , and energy levels from johansson ( 1994 ) .",
    "a cloud is divided into @xmath32 zones , the ionization and @xmath17 are determined self - consistently , and the emission is determined for the local optical depths .",
    "we developed the code to model the broad line regions of quasars ( verner et al .",
    "1995 , 1996 ) , incorporating the physics described by wills , netzer , & wills ( 1985 ) .",
    "we included pumping by line overlap from all @xmath33 emission lines included in cloudy , by line overlap , and by the incident continuum .",
    "we verified that the atom goes to lte in the high - density limit , and that in the low density limit each excitation is followed simply by radiative cascades . a simple limit of our model ( one zone , constant temperature , constant density , no continuum radiation flux , no line pumping , no interactions with other species ) corresponds to the bpo and bpp collisional model , and we can reproduce in this limit the line ratios presented in figure 2 of bpo , using their atomic data . note that figure 2@xmath34 of bpo erroneously compared the predicted @xmath35 ratio with the observed inverted @xmath36 ratio , although their caption for figure 2@xmath34 stated the ratio to be @xmath37",
    ".    tables 2 and 3 present results of our photoionization calculations .",
    "model a is calculated with the parameters taken from bfm with improved gas - phase elemental abundances based on results from otv and rubin et al .",
    "( 1991 , 1992 ) : h : he : c : n : o : ne : na : mg : al : si : s : cl : ar : ca : fe @xmath38 , grains , ionization by the central star @xmath9  ori  c , and a hydrostatic blister",
    ". results of model a differ from the original bfm model , since the underlying atomic database has been improved considerably .",
    "model b has the same parameters as model a , but the incident continua from the other three trapezium stars are included ( an estimated 70% of the total flux at 2300    is due to @xmath9 ori c ) . in models",
    "a and b , the gas pressure was kept constant .",
    "model c is the same as model b , except that the total ( gas and radiative ) pressure is kept constant ; this reveals some sensitivity of the predicted spectrum to the assumed pressure law .",
    "table 3 highlights the [ ] line ratios obtained from our photoionization models .",
    "a comparison with the observed line ratios and with the line ratios calculated within the collisional model at the same density @xmath31  @xmath1 ( model ii ) indicates that the upper levels of the atom , those that produce the optical lines , can be effectively populated by continuum pumping .",
    "the lower levels that produce the 8617 , 8892 , and 12567 lines are mostly populated by collisions in both photoionization and collisional models .",
    "note therefore the sensitivity of the optical to near - infrared [ ] line ratios to the increased pumping from the other trapezium stars ( model b versus model a ) .",
    "further evidence against high electron densities in the [ ] emitting region in orion comes from infrared observations by lowe et al .",
    "they find that the 12567 line is the only line clearly detected in the infrared spectrum of orion  it is actually the strongest [ ] line in the infrared and optical .",
    "our models at @xmath39  @xmath1 predict that the 12567 line is @xmath40 times _ stronger _ than the 8617 line , in good agreement with the observations .",
    "if the 12567 line were 23 times _ weaker _ than the 8617 line as predicted at @xmath41  @xmath1 , it would not have been detected at all .",
    "table 2 includes the relative strength of [ ] 8617 compared to lines of other species , information crucial to abundance analysis .",
    "our photoionization models match the observations in tables 2 & 3 quite well . the strongly depleted fe / h in the gas phase , @xmath42 , is close to the value @xmath43 found from kao observations of the ground state [ ] 22.9@xmath44 m line ( @xcite and in preparation ) .",
    "even with solar abundances , iron is not a major coolant in orion , and so the intensities of [ ] lines scale linearly with abundance .",
    "therefore , if solar fe / h ( bpo , bp95 ) were used instead , the predicted [ ] lines would be 11 times stronger and very discrepant with observations .",
    "bp95 , using [ ] / [ ] line ratios , inferred that the fe / o abundance in the proposed high - density region is close to solar . based on our new upper limit on the [ ] 5577 strength , which is 3.2 times lower than one used by bp95 ,",
    "the fe / o abundance would be higher than 3 times solar , if we adopt their high density .",
    "if iron were depleted , these numbers would be even larger .",
    "both photoionization and collisional models predict that the [ ] and [ ] emission line regions should be nearly coincident .",
    "our upper limit on the density derived from the [ ] line ratio is consistent with the origin of [ ] lines in a region of moderate density , @xmath39  @xmath1 .",
    "\\1 . previous measurements of [ ] 5577 were affected by telluric emission . our limit to the line sets limits on the density and temperature consistent with the physical conditions inferred from the other emission lines .",
    "the high - density collisional model for the formation of the [ ] lines is inconsistent with the strongest observed [ ] line at 12567   . in combination with the new upper limit on the [ ] 5577 line , the inferred fe / o ratio in any putative high - density region would be at least 3 times solar , not solar as found by bp95 .",
    "our photoionization models of the [ ] spectrum with parameters close to those found by bfm predict a spectrum in good overall agreement with observations .",
    "the infrared [ ] lines are produced by collisional excitation , and the optical [ ] lines by photon pumping by the ultraviolet continuum in a region of moderate density , @xmath39  @xmath1 .",
    "fe / h must be depleted , @xmath45 , in agreement with independent determinations from kao observations .",
    "the photoionization models have several parameters which can affect the resulting [ ] spectrum , including the flux of the pumping continuum , turbulent velocity , and bulk motions in the gas .",
    "the shape of the ionizing continuum , the pressure law , and gas phase abundances are major parameters which affect the emission of the stronger cno lines .",
    "detailed fitting of the orion nebula spectra will be the subject of a future paper .",
