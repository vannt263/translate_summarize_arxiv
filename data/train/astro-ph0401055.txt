    "uncorrelated variations of brightness in the images of a distant source , splitted by the gravitational field of the lensing galaxy are indicative of microlensing events . the phenomenon is clearly seen , e.g. , in q2237 + 0305 , which is known to consist of four lensed quasar images within a 1-arcsec radius circle around the center of the lensing galaxy .",
    "the uncorrelated brightness variations of these images indicate that the effects of microlenses are mainly observed , but not the intrinsic quasar brightness variations .",
    "because of significant difficulties of theoretic analysis , microlensing phenomena are investigated mostly with numerical methods .",
    "a standard procedure for numerical simulation consists in the following .",
    "the effect of all microlenses , randomly distributed inside the galaxy , is described in a twofold manner .",
    "the microlenses , which are the most close ones to the observed image of the source , are specified with their actual deflection angles . the number of such microlenses is not expected to be larger than several hundreds , ( paczynski 1986 ; seitz & schneider 1994 ; blandford & narayan 1992 ) . the rest of microlenses , which are far from the line of sight , as well as the smoothly distributed matter ,",
    "are specified by introducing a deflection angle , averaged over the interstellar space . the further simplification of the problem is due to linearization of the mean deflection angle of the macrolens near a selected lensed image , ( seitz & schneider 1994 ; blandford & narayan 1992 ; schneider et al .",
    "the procedure of the local simplification works well for isolated source images , which are essentially far from the macrolens critical curve .",
    "it is of interest , however , to investigate also an overall interaction of macro and microlenses for the lensing galaxy as a whole .",
    "therewith , a possibility appears to follow the changes of spatial density of microcaustics , and the velocities of their displacement depending on their location with respect to the critical curve of the macrolens . in these cases , typical spatial and temporal scales of microfocusings substantially differ from those obtained with the linearized approach .",
    "the analysis is of a particular importance in studying microlensing by a star , which is in its turn surrounded by a large amount of planetary - mass objects .",
    "such a complex gl will be further considered as a system of macro - milli - microlenses .",
    "in addition to spatial redistribution of brightness in the apparent images , complex deformations of their light curves also take place in gravitational lensing of sources , which are extended in space and variable in time .",
    "the amount of the deformation depends not only on the parameters of the gl ,  mass distribution in the lens ,  but on the parameters of the source as well , such as the emitting region dimension , its location with respect to the critical curve , and on duration of the source brightness spikes .",
    "the amount of light curve deformations turned out to be different for different lensed images .",
    "gl can be regarded as a multi - channel filter , which passes slow brightness variations and smoothes rapid ones .",
    "the aim of this work was to analyze theoretically and simulate numerically the structures of critical curves and caustics of complex gravitational lenses , which consist of macro- and microlenses , for various locations of microlenses with respect to the macrolens critical curve .",
    "also , peculiarities of gravitational focusing of the source with the arbitrarily distributed masses were investigated for the case , when the source is extended in space and variable in time . to obtain numerical estimates ,",
    "the results were applied to the einstein cross q2237 + 0305 .",
    "a complex gl can be presented as a sum of two constituents , with one of them being due to the masses , contained in compact objects , such as stars , star - like and planet - like bodies , and the second one , connected with a diffuse matter , such as dusty and dusty - gazeous clouds .",
    "compact objects , referred to as microlenses ( or millilenses ) hereafter , can be defined as point masses @xmath0 .",
    "a total amount of microlenses @xmath1 in the lensing galaxy is sufficiently large .",
    "for example , @xmath2 for a spiral galaxy similar to q2237 + 0305 .",
    "the effect of microlensing was at first analyzed for a single microlens , and the results were then generalized to the case of many microlenses .",
    "let us introduce a cartesian coordinate system @xmath3 with the origin in the galaxy center of masses , and the @xmath4 axis crossing the point of observations , ( fig .",
    "1 ) . let @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the distances between the gl , the observer @xmath7 and the source @xmath8 , respectively . since @xmath5 and @xmath6 are much larger than the size of the region , where the light beams undergo deflection , we consider the gl as a thin phase screen , ( bliokh & minakov , 1989 ) , which is superposed with the @xmath9 plane .",
    "having selected a single microlens from a totality of @xmath10 microlenses , located at the lens plane and characterized by the impact parameter @xmath11 , we have for the deflection angle at the lens plane , ( @xmath9 ) :    @xmath12    here , @xmath13 is the angle of observation , @xmath14 a coordinate and @xmath15 a gravitational radius of the i - th microlens , @xmath16 is the gravitational constant , and @xmath17 is the velocity of light .",
    "@xmath18 is a component vector of the deflection angle , connected with the diffusely distributed matter . supposing a multidimensional distribution function of random quantities @xmath19 and a distribution law for the diffuse matter in the galaxy to be known , one",
    "can obtain the average defection angle @xmath20 and the variance @xmath21 from eq . 1 , ( see e.g. , bliokh & minakov 1989 , schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) .    the gl with the average deflection angle @xmath20 is called a regular lens , or a macrolens .",
    "the approximation suits a gl , which has the densities of stellar masses and diffuse matter `` smeared '' over sufficiently large regions of the interstellar space .",
    "consider a `` small '' region of space , located near the @xmath22 microlens , which has the size , from one hand , small enough as compared to the typical interstellar distance @xmath23 in the particular region , and from the other hand , is larger than or comparable to the characteristic angular size of the einstein ring @xmath24 for the given microlens , @xmath25 accounting for the smallness of the rms deflection angle ( bliokh & minakov 1989 , schneider et al .",
    "1992 ) , one can easily show , that in fact , the second and the third addends in eg.(1 ) do not differ from the mean deflection angle @xmath26    with all the above noted taken into account , the equation of the complex lens can be written as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the actual location of the `` point '' source , and @xmath29    the lens equation can be better written in normalized quantities @xmath30 it is convenient to determine the normalizing angle @xmath31 as the angular radius of the einstein ring , which would be observed for the given macrolens , provided it did not contain an asymmetric constituent of the mass distribution . in the normalized quantities ,",
    "the equation of lens ( 2 ) can be presented as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is a constituent , connected with the macrolens galaxy , and @xmath34 is a small parameter , that is approximately equal to the ratio of the microlens mass to the total mass of the galaxy .",
    "the gravitational lens system q2237 + 0305 was selected as an example , for which various models of mass distribution are known , ( see , e.g. , kent & falco 1988 , minakov & shalyapin 1991 , wambsganss & webster 1997 ) . basing on the observational data , let us choose the model to be simple enough , but in such a way , that it would be able to produce the observed cross - shaped structure .",
    "let the regular constituent of the deflection angle @xmath35 be presented as a sum of two terms , with one of them , @xmath36 being connected with a massive disc , and the other one , @xmath37 ,  with a compact nucleus .",
    "to simplify the analysis , suppose the nucleus and the disc are spherically and elliptically symmetric , respectively , with their centers coinciding .",
    "superpose the directions of @xmath38 and @xmath39 axes with the axes of symmetry of the disc component . since the typical scale for changing the surface density of the disc component in q2237 + 0305 exceeds noticeably the region , where four quasar components are observed , - about 2 , - one may use the following approximation for @xmath36 near the center of the galaxy : @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are unit vectors of the cartesian coordinate system .",
    "having supposed characteristic size of the galaxy compact nucleus to be smaller than the region , where the four images are observed , let us approximate the spherical component by a point mass , equal to the mass of the galaxy nucleus @xmath44 . with the accepted simplifications and suggestions , and having in mind , that for the chosen model of the disc @xmath45 the regular component of the macrolens equation can be brought to a form , ( minakov & shalyapin 1991 ) : @xmath46 here , @xmath47 is a dimensionless parameter that determines the amount of asymmetry , introduced by the disc component near the galaxy center . for the q2237 + 0305 model ,",
    "the normalizing angle @xmath48 @xmath49 can be estimated to be @xmath50 , and the asymmetry parameter can be selected equal to @xmath51 therefore , the inequality @xmath52 holds .",
    "the equation of the critical curve of a gl @xmath53 is obtained from the condition that jacobian of transformation from variables @xmath54 to variables @xmath55 is equal to zero : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the amplification factor .",
    "if we substitute the solution of @xmath58 , found from ( 5 ) , to the initial lens equation ( 3 ) , we will obtain the equation of caustic in the source plane : @xmath59 as the first step of the further analysis , let us determine the critical curve @xmath60 and caustic @xmath61 of the macrolens , having supposed @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( 3 ) . for example , for the model ( 4 ) in the polar coordinates @xmath63 in a linear approximation with respect to a small parameter @xmath47 , we have : @xmath64 with the azimuth angle counted off the @xmath65 axis .",
    "the equation of caustic of the regular gl in the source plane in the same approximation is : @xmath66 the model of a regular gl under consideration is seen to produce an oval critical curve in the lens plane , with an approximately unit average radius , - @xmath67 while the corresponding caustic curve in the source plane is diamond - shaped , with the typical size of @xmath68 it can be easily shown , that four images will emerge in projection of the point source @xmath8 inside the diamond caustics ( 8) , with two images outside the critical curve , and two ones inside the curve ( 7 ) in the lens plane , ( see , e.g. minakov & shalyapin 1991 ) .",
    "because of smallness of @xmath47 , the images are located close to the critical curve ( 7 ) .",
    "regarding the equations of the macrolens critical curve and caustic to be known , one may investigate deformations of the curves for various locations of a microlens @xmath69 with a specified parameter @xmath49 .",
    "a simple method was applied to numerically solve eq.(5 ) .",
    "the problem of finding the roots of equation @xmath70 can be substituted by a more simple one .",
    "thus , it is easy to numerically determine the regions of positive , @xmath71 and negative , @xmath72 values of @xmath73 excluding singularities , connected with the point mass approximation , the problem is reduced to determining the boundary between the positive and negative values of @xmath73 the simulation has shown , that a behavior of critical curves and the relevant caustics of a complex gl depends not only on the distance between a microlens and the critical curve of a regular gl , but also on the sector , where the microlens moves .",
    "critical curves and caustics for the q2237 + 0305 model were calculated for different locations of the microlens , - inside and outside the critical curve of the regular gl , and exactly in it ,  and are shown in fig .",
    "3a , b , c . the cases of the microlens displacement along the @xmath65 and @xmath74 axes were examined .",
    "to ensure better view of macro- and microcurves behavior in the same picture , a sufficiently large value for @xmath75 was selected , @xmath76 the curves for @xmath77 will be also presented below .    for a microlens outside the critical curve of a regular gl , ",
    "fig.2a , @xmath78 region ,  the curve @xmath53 consists of two closed curves .",
    "one of them is a slightly deformed macrolens critical curve @xmath79 , and the other one appears around the microlens .",
    "the similar behavior of the critical curve of a complex gl is observed also when the microlens is inside the critical curve of a regular macrolens ,  fig .",
    "2b , @xmath80 in contrast to the case 2a , however , the microlens critical curve is not a single deformed oval around the microlens ( einstein `` ring '' ) , but consists of two closed curves on either side of the microlens . the most interesting case , when the microlens is situated right at the macrolens critical curve , is shown in fig.2c .",
    "the critical curves of macro- and microlenses merge into a joint continuous curve in this case .",
    "a numerical analysis allows to clearly demonstrate a complex deformation of critical and caustic curves , but mathematic analysis is needed to obtain qantitative estimates of the expected effects , that would make it possible to follow their dependence on the model parameters . determining of the real roots of eq.(5 ) for the given values of displacement @xmath69 and parameter @xmath81 is the major task of the analytic investigation .",
    "the following conclusions have been made in the present theoretic analysis , applied to a particular case of q2237 + 0305 , ( minakov & vakulik 2000 ) :    * a microlens distorts a critical curve @xmath79 and caustic @xmath82 of a regular gl .",
    "the amount of deformation is proportional to @xmath49 and decreases rapidly as the distance between the microlens and the macrolens critical curve is growing , see fig .",
    "3 . since rather large number of microlenses may be present near the critical curve simultaneously , their joint effect will cause `` blurring '' of boundaries of the critical curve and caustic of the macrolens . in fig .",
    "4 , the structure of critical curves and caustics for q2237 + 0305 is shown for the case of three hundred microlenses , located near the @xmath79 . *",
    "a structure and behavior of critical curves near the microlens depends not only on the distance to the critical curve of the regular gl , but on the sector of angles as well .",
    "characteristic dimensions of critical curves and caustics are proportional to @xmath83 * the strongest deformation of critical curves and caustics , proportional to @xmath84 is observed when microlenses are situated very close to the critical curve of the regular gl . the curves for macro- and microlenses merge together to form complex continuous curves . *",
    "the difference between the results , obtained with the proposed approach and those of the linear approximation is the larger the closer a microlens to the critical curve , as can be seen from fig .",
    "the effect of interacting microlenses increases noticeably in their approaching the critical curve of a regular gl . *",
    "if even microlenses are distributed homogeneously , spatial distribution of their microcaustics is substantially inhomogeneous near the macrocaustic , see fig .",
    "such an inhomogeneity results in spatial scale of microlensing being dependent on the macroimage location with respect to the macrolens critical curve .    the theoretic analysis and the obtained estimates are capable of examining more complicated situations as well .",
    "suppose , for example , that a complex gl system consists of a macrolens galaxy , millilens star , with the mass of order of @xmath85 , and of a large number of microlenses , ",
    "planetary bodies with the masses of @xmath86 .",
    "if a millilens is situated far from the critical curve of the macrolens galaxy , the effect of focusing can be more easily analyzed in the coordinate system superposed with the millilens . in doing so",
    ", the gravitational field of the galaxy may be considered in the linear approximation , while the effect of microlenses , randomly distributed around the millilens , should be considered in the way similar to that described above .",
    "it is only necessary to renormalize the angles to the quantity @xmath87 , corresponding to the einstein ring of the millilens .",
    "the parameter @xmath88 will be proportional to the ratio of the mass of the @xmath89-th microlens to the mass of the millilens .",
    "a complicated redistribution of brightness in the observed image takes place in gravitational focusing .",
    "if parameters of the source and the lens do not change in time , the brightness distribution @xmath90 observed through the gl is related to the actual source brightness distribution @xmath91 by a convolution - like formula , ( bliokh & minakov 1989 ) : @xmath92 d\\vec\\psi_s.\\ ] ] here , @xmath93 $ ] is the delta - function .",
    "the formula represents mathematically the property inherent in all the nonabsorbing lenses to remain the brightness along a particular light ray unchanged .    several compact bright images ( macroimages ) , separated by a few arcseconds",
    "are usually observed in actual gravitational lenses .",
    "the macroimages have dimensions approximately coinsiding with those of the source emitting regions .",
    "for example , they are about @xmath94 arcseconds for quasars in optical wavelegths . for radio wavelengths , angular dimensions of macroimages may be several orders of magnitude larger .",
    "contemporary instruments ,  telescopes , radio telescopes ,  do not have a resolution high enough to examine the fine structure of macroimages @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , the source brightness , integrated over angles will be observed : @xmath96 amplification of the source brightness , resulted from gravitational focusing of a stationary source , is characterized by the amplification factor @xmath97 , which is defined as : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the source brightness , which would be observed without the gl .",
    "if @xmath100 is ment to be a total brightness of the whole distorted image of the source , then @xmath97 determines the total amplification factor of the lens .",
    "if @xmath100 is the brightness of the @xmath101the macroimage , then @xmath97 means the amplification factor of the @xmath101th macroimage , @xmath102 . in this case , coefficients @xmath97 and @xmath102 are associated by a simple relationship : @xmath103 in the more general case , when the brightness of the source varies not only in angles , but also in time , ",
    "@xmath104 ,  while the gl parameters are virtually unchanged , equations ( 9 ) and ( 10 ) can be generalized to take the form ( minakov & nechaev 1998 ) : @xmath105 \\delta\\left[\\vec\\psi_s-\\vec f(\\vec\\psi)\\right]d\\vec\\psi,\\ ] ] @xmath106 @xmath107 is a signal propagation time along a virtual ray , that connects an arbitrary point of the source @xmath108 with an arbitrary point at the lens plane @xmath109 , and , further , with the observer @xmath7 .",

    "some conclusions can be made from the analysis of gravitational focusing of the extended source , that varies in time .    if a gravitational lens forms several images of the source , the light curve of an individual image @xmath228 will depend on the value of parameter @xmath190 , which accounts simultaneously for geometry of the task ( distances from the observer to the source and to the lens , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively ) , parameters of the lens ( a total mass and its distribution ) , and the source parameters ( @xmath229 ) . for the model of gl q2237 + 0305 under consideration ,  a lens with a quadrupole ,  the value of @xmath190 was estimated to be @xmath230    if @xmath231 ( @xmath232  a `` small '' source , `` weak '' lens or `` long '' impulse ) , the light curve @xmath228 does not depend on @xmath190 any more , and differs from the undisturbed light curve @xmath233 by a multiplier @xmath97 only .    for small values of @xmath190 , when @xmath234 , ( @xmath235  `` extended '' source , `` strong '' lens , or `` short '' impulse ) , a smoothing action of the lens should be taken into account .",
    "amounts of deformations will be different for different images , because of the existing difference in @xmath236    the analysis of focusing action of a gl with an arbitrary mass distribution allows to argue , that the gl acts as a filter , transmitting low frequencies ( slow brightness variations ) with no distortion , and `` rejecting '' the higher ones ,  rapid variations .",
