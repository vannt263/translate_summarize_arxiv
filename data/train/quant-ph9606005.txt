    "the non - unitary effects will manifest themselves specifically through the dynamical evolution of the eigenvalues of the subsystem reduced density matrices , so that individual subsystems evolve in general in a non - isoentropic fashion .    a first mean - field - like approximation to this general picture consists in assuming isoentropic subsystem evolution under effective , time - dependent hamiltonian operators for each subsystem .",

    "the effectiveness of the present treatment of these corrections can be judged by comparing its results with the exact solution . as can be seen in the figures ,",
    "the approximate solution is quantitatively adequate up to times comparable with the depolarization time .",
    "we may infer from this that the inclusion of the present approximation of the collision integrals in the dynamical equations is not only fundamental to generate the qualitative behavior associated with the decorrelation process related to the initial damping of the rabi oscillations , but also successfully describes such effects quantitatively over a time span covering at least several rabbi periods .",
    "improvements of the collisional approximation implemented here are however needed if one wishes to extend time range of quantitative reliability .",
    "finally , we briefly comment on the extension of the present treatment to 3 + 1 dimensions in a field - theoretical context ( the scalar plasma @xcite ) . in general",
    ", an entirely analogous procedure will apply also to this case , if only one expands the field operators in terms of the eigenfunctions of the corresponding extended one - fermion and one - boson densities .",
    "this is in general a time - dependent basis whose evolution will be determined by generalized forms of eqs .",
    "( [ 49 ] ) and ( [ 50 ] ) .",
    "the case of a spatially uniform system is particularly simple , since in this case the extended densities are diagonal in a plane - wave representation .",
    "it can be handled therefore in complete analogy with the 0 + 1 dimensional case if one uses a momentum expansion of the field operators @xcite .",
    "as expected , the usual infinities of quantum field theory show up and can be absorbed by introducing appropriate counterterms .",
