    "<S> we investigate an exact solution that describes the embedding of the four - dimensional ( 4d ) perfect fluid in a five - dimensional ( 5d ) einstein spacetime . </S>",
    "<S> the effective metric of the 4d perfect fluid as a hypersurface with induced matter is equivalent to the robertson - walker metric of cosmology . </S>",
    "<S> this general solution shows interconnections among many 5d solutions , such as the solution in the braneworld scenario and the topological black hole with cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> if the 5d cosmological constant is positive , the metric periodically depends on the extra dimension . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can compactify the extra dimension on @xmath0 and study the phenomenological issues . </S>",
    "<S> we also generalize the metric ansatz to the higher - dimensional case , in which the 4d part of the einstein equations can be reduced to a linear equation . </S>"
