    "the `` fermi bubbles '' are giant gamma - ray structures extending above and below the galactic center ( gc ) for about 8 kpc ( dobler et al . 2010 ; su et al . 2010 ; ackermann et al . 2014 ) .",
    "the gamma - ray emission of the bubbles is spatially correlated with the so - called `` wmap haze '' , which is characterized by a spherical morphology with radius @xmath10 4  kpc centered at the gc , and was recently confirmed by @xmath11 observations ( planck collaboration 2013 ) .",
    "moreover , the recently discovered giant linearly - polarized radio lobes emanating from the gc also show a close correspondence to the fermi bubbles ( carretti et al .",
    "it has thus been argued that the bubbles were created by some large episode of energy injection in the gc , such as an agn - like outburst ( e.g. , guo et al .",
    "2012 ; yang et al . 2012 ) or from nuclear starburst activity ( e.g. , lacki 2014 ) in the past with an energy release of 10@xmath12 erg over 10 myr ago ( su et al . 2010",
    "; crocker & aharonian 2011 ; carreti et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "interestingly , the idea of a nuclear outburst which happened in the gc was first proposed over 40 years ago prior to the discovery of the fermi bubbles ( e.g. , sofue 1977 ; 1984 ; 1994 ; 2000 ; bland - hawthorn & cohen 2003 ) .",
    "relatedly , a number of observations in x - rays have been discussed in the literature as evidence that the gc has experienced multiple epochs of enhanced source activity , including the @xmath13-k@xmath14 echo from molecular clouds ( e.g. , koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; ryu et al .",
    "2013 ) and the presence of an over - ionized clump with a jet - like structure ( nakashima et al .",
    "2013 ) . particularly noteworthy",
    "is the giant galactic feature called the north polar spur ( nps ) that is seen both in x - ray and radio maps and believed to be a part of the radio loop - i structure .",
    "sofue ( 2000 ) interpreted the nps as a result of a large - scale outflow from the gc with a total energy of @xmath1010@xmath12 erg within a timescale of @xmath15 myr , exactly consistent with the values discussed to create the fermi bubbles above . in this context ,",
    "totani ( 2006 ) has shown that various other observational properties like the 511 kev line emission ( e.g. , weidenspointner et al .",
    "2008 ) in the gc can also be naturally explained in the framework of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) , if the outflow energy expected is 10@xmath16 erg or 3@xmath1710@xmath18 erg s@xmath19 .",
    "assuming that the nps and other prominent x - ray enhancements in the vicinity of the fermi bubbles are all related in origin , we started a project consisting of x - ray observations along the edge regions of the fermi bubbles since 2012 , together with a systematic analysis of archival data provided by and over the past 10 years .",
    "kataoka et al .",
    "( 2013 ; paper - i ) first carried out 14 x - ray observations positioned across the north - east and the southern - most edges of the fermi bubbles with a total requested exposure of 280 ksec .",
    "they found that the detected diffuse x - ray emission is reproduced by a three - component plasma model including unabsorbed thermal emission of the local bubble ( lb : @xmath0 @xmath1 0.1  kev ) , absorbed thermal emission related to the nps and/or galactic halo ( gh : @xmath0 @xmath1 0.3  kev ) , and a power - law component reproducing the cosmic x - ray background .",
    "this finding was confirmed by tahara et al .",
    "( 2015 ; paper - ii ) who observed two other prominent x - ray structures , the north - cap ( n - cap ) and south - east claw ( se - claw ) seen in the rosat 0.75 kev image ( snowden et al . 1995 ) and/or maxi all - sky survey mid - band image ( 1.7@xmath204.0 kev ; kimura et al .",
    "together with new evidence of a large amount of neutral matter absorbing the thermal plasma , in paper - i & ii , we argued that the observed @xmath0 @xmath1 0.3 kev gas was heated by a weak shock driven by the bubbles expansion in the surrounding halo , with the corresponding velocity @xmath21 @xmath10 300 km s@xmath19 , which is consistent with the recent finding of a non - thermal velocity in the x - ray absorption line toward 3c  273 situated in the sightline of the fermi bubbles ( fang & jiang 2014 ; but see also fox et al .",
    "2015 for the ultraviolet absorption line features toward pds  456 ) .",
    "such a low expansion velocity is also supported by some theoretical models discussing the fermi bubbles morphology ( e.g. , crocker et al .",
    "2014 ; fujita et al . 2014 ; mou et al .",
    "also , tahara et al .",
    "( 2015 ) found possible evidence of 0.7 kev plasma in addition to 0.3 kev plasma in the northernmost region of the bubble .",
    "while @xmath0 @xmath1 0.3 kev plasma was ubiquitously observed in papers - i and ii , and was regarded as evidence of a shock - heated halo , these observations were highly biased toward the directions of x - ray enhancements and prominent structures like the nps , n - cap and se - claw .",
    "in fact , given the large spatial extent of the fermi bubbles within the galactic longitudes @xmath2@xmath3@xmath2 @xmath4 20  and latitude @xmath2@xmath6@xmath2 @xmath4 60 , most of the bubbles interior were unprobed .",
    "thus our goal in this paper is to determine the global characteristics and nature of diffuse x - ray emission associated with the fermi bubbles , utilizing as many x - ray data pointings as possible .",
    "we thus analyzed a total of 29 archival datasets obtained with _",
    "( mitsuda et al.2007 ) and 68 archival datasets from _ swift _ ( gehrels et al . 2004 ) whose pointing centers are situated at galactic longitudes @xmath2@xmath3@xmath2 @xmath4 20and latitude 5@xmath5 @xmath2@xmath6@xmath2 @xmath4 60 , spanning the full spatial extent of the fermi bubbles above and below the gc",

    "the analysis process and results for and are briefly summarized in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss our findings in the context of proposed toy models assuming a ( i ) filled - halo without bubbles and a ( ii ) bubble - in - halo geometry .",
    "we also discuss a possible origin of asymmetry in the galactic latitude profiles of the derived x - ray emission measure observed in the north and south bubbles .",
    "section 5 presents our conclusions .",
    "as detailed in paper - i and ii , we conducted dedicated observations of the fermi bubbles in 2012 and 2013 as a part of ao7 and and ao8 programs .",
    "the _ suzaku _ satellite ( mitsuda et al .",

    "we selected pointings in which ( i ) the normal xis observing mode was adopted throughout the observation , ( ii ) no bright x - ray features , such as compact sources and cluster gas , exist in the same filed of view that may affect the analysis of diffuse x - ray emission , and ( iii ) @xmath2@xmath6@xmath2 @xmath24 5  to avoid strong contamination from the gc region and/or bulge emission ( e.g. , koyama et al .",

    "we calibrated level 1 data as recommended by _",
    "swift _ team",
    ". specifically , we selected good time interval ( gti ) from the level 1 data using ` xrtpipeline ` and the temperature of the ccds were set to `` @xmath29 '' in the reduction .",
    "for the diffuse emission analysis of the data , we first ran the source detection algorithm in ` ximage ` ( giommi et al .",
    "1992 ) to eliminate compact x - ray features from diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "we set the source region to the whole ccd chip that remained after excluding all the compact features detected at significance levels above 3@xmath30 with typical 2 radius circles enough to avoid the contamination from the compact sources .",
    "then we used all the fi and bi ccds , namely , xis0 , 1 , 3 for the spectral analysis to maximize the photon statistics .",
    "we made redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) using ` xisrmfgen ` ( ishisaki et al .",

    "2007 ) and new contamination files ( released on 2013 august 13 ) , assuming the uniform extension of the diffuse emission within 20 radii orbicular regions ( giving the arf area of 0.35 deg@xmath31 ) .",
    "we subtracted as background , the nxb data obtained from the region in the same ccd chip . because some of the exposures are short ( @xmath1010 ksec ; table  1 ) , we carefully checked the analysis results by adopting different choices for source extraction radii and nxb / cxb models but the results were unchanged within the uncertainties given in table 3 .        similarly in the xrt analysis , we extracted x - ray images in the energy range of 0.5@xmath205  kev using ` xselect ` .",
    "exposure maps were made using ` xrtexpomap ` .",
    "we ran the source detection algorithm in ` ximage ` and searched for x - ray compact features which were detected with photon statistics at @xmath9  3@xmath30 confidence levels over the background . in the xrt spectral analysis of the diffuse emission ,",
    "pha files were extracted from event files with ` xselect ` .",
    "we made arfs using ` xrtmkarf ` , while we used the current redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) in caldb . to extract photons from diffuse x - ray emission only , we eliminated all the point sources using circles of 30radius .",
    "in contrast to data , evaluation of the instrumental background ( nxb ) is not well established for the xrt data and studies are still ongoing ( e.g. , moretti et al . 2009 ; 2011 ; 2012 ) . however , as shown in moretti et al .",
    "( 2011 , fig .  5 therein )",
    ", the contribution of the nxb with respect to the cxb is less than 20@xmath32 below 2  kev and gradually increases to @xmath2450@xmath32 at above 5  kev . given that each pointing ( table 2 ) is typically less than 10 ksec thus too short to derive meaningful spectra above 5 kev , we did not use the data above 5 kev for the spectral fitting .",
    "moreover , we modeled the total xrt background as the sum of the nxb and cxb and checked that the analysis results for the diffuse emission were unchanged ( within 1@xmath30 uncertainty ; see the next section ) when changing the upper boundary to either 5  kev or 2  kev in the spectral fitting .",
    "following paper - i and ii , all the spectra of the and pointings after removing compact x - ray sources were fitted with a three component plasma model apec1 + wabs*(apec2 + pl ) using ` xspec ` .",
    "the model consists of an _ unabsorbed _ thermal component ( denoted as apec1 ) which represent the local bubble emission and/or contamination from the solar - wind charge exchange ( swcx ; fujimoto et al .",
    "2007 ) , an _ absorbed _ thermal component ( denoted as apec2 ) representing the gh , and a single power - law component ( denoted as pl ) corresponding to the isotropic cxb radiation together with instrumental background for the case of xrt .",
    "the photon index for the cxb component was fixed at @xmath33 ( kushino et al .",
    "the temperature and abundance of the lb plasma were fixed at @xmath34kev and @xmath35 , respectively , as we did in paper - i and ii ( see also , e.g. , yoshino et al . 2009",
    "; henley & shelton 2013 ) .        as for the absorbed diffuse emission ,",
    "the neutral hydrogen column density was fixed to the galactic value @xmath36 in the direction of each pointing because most of the values are consistent with the full galactic values when @xmath37 was left free in the spectral fitting .",
    "we also fixed the abundance of the apec2 at @xmath38 , which is the on - average preferred value as detailed in appendix b of paper - i .",
    "also this level of sub - solar metallicity is supported by a recent study of the gh using the @xmath39-@xmath40 reflection grating spectrometer which measured the o vii k@xmath14 absorption line ( miller & bregman 2013 ; but see , e.g. , yao et al .",

    ", the photon statistics are too low to derive individual spectra for the 68 xrt pointings , except 6 regions positioned at the bright x - ray enhancements denoted as the nps , nw - clump , and se - claw in fig .  1 .",
    "we therefore generated a spectrum by stacking xrt data typically every 5  in galactic latitude ( @xmath42 @xmath6 @xmath1 5@xmath2015 ) to increase the photon statistics .",
    "the results of our spectral fitting obtained for the data and data are summarized in table 3 and 4 , respectively . in both tables , `` pl norm '' represents the power - law intensity as measured in 2@xmath2010 kev , normalized by the absolute intensity of the cxb , namely @xmath43erg@xmath44s@xmath19sr@xmath19 ( kushino et al .",
    "the value is close to unity for the data with some variations expected from the large - scale fluctuation of the cxb itself .",
    "the slightly larger values of pl norm in the data indicate non - negligible contribution from the nxb in this energy band as mentioned above .      as can be seen in tables 3 & 4 , the temperature of the gh as modeled by apec2 is well represented by @xmath0 @xmath1 0.3 kev , whilst the emission measure ( em ) widely spans an order of magnitude depending on the galactic latitude . to view the trend more clearly , fig .",

    "red filled circles indicate x - ray enhancements corresponding to the nps , nw - clump and se - claw , as also marked in red in fig .  1 .",
    "one can see the temperature is surprisingly uniform over a wide range of galactic latitude 5@xmath5 @xmath2@xmath6@xmath2 @xmath4 60  with fluctuations in @xmath0 of only 0.30@xmath70.07 kev over the whole spatial extent of the fermi bubbles .    while the temperature values are uniform , the em values increase steeply toward the gc ( i.e. , low @xmath2@xmath6@xmath2 ) with sudden jumps possibly related to the x - ray enhancements near the fermi bubbles edges . moreover , the em distribution is asymmetric with respect to the galactic plane , decreasing more gradually in the north ( @xmath6 @xmath9 0 ) than in the south ( @xmath6 @xmath4 0 ) toward high galactic latitudes .",
    "for example , em at 20@xmath4 @xmath6 @xmath4 35 , ( 5.82@xmath70.76)@xmath1710@xmath47 @xmath48 pc , is more than a factor of two larger than the corresponding em in the south , where ( 2.52@xmath49)@xmath1710@xmath47 @xmath48 pc at @xmath2035@xmath4 @xmath6 @xmath4 @xmath2025 .",
    "more about the origin of this asymmetry is discussed in the following section .",
    "following paper - i & ii , we continued our systematic analysis of diffuse x - ray emission possibly related with the fermi bubbles using data from both and _ swift_. the x - ray data analyzed here were collected from archival observations covering galactic longitude @xmath2@xmath3@xmath2 @xmath4 20@xmath23 and latitude 5@xmath5 @xmath2@xmath6@xmath2 @xmath4 60 , approximately coinciding with the spatial extent of the fermi bubbles .",
    "we showed that ( i ) the temperature of the gh is uniform along galactic latitude with @xmath0 @xmath1 0.30@xmath70.07 kev , ( ii ) the em , in contrast , varies widely by more than an order of magnitude , with its values gradually decreasing toward high @xmath6 , and ( iii ) the distribution of em is asymmetric between the north and south bubbles . while the north / south asymmetry is evident in the rosat 0.75 kev image ( snowden et al .",
    "1995 ) , we showed for the first time this is mainly accounted for by variations in the em rather than differences in plasma temperature @xmath0 that emits @xmath10.75 kev x - rays .",

    "although it is still unclear whether the observed @xmath0 @xmath1 0.3 kev plasma is really associated with the bubbles ( see discussion in paper - i ) , we are particularly interested in the global structure and asymmetry of em ( ( ii ) and ( iii ) described above ) in order to further understand the possible relation between the observed @xmath0 @xmath1 0.3 kev plasma with the fermi bubbles .          here",
    "we assume a simple model in which two spherical bubbles , that mimic the north and south fermi bubbles , are embedded in the center of a gaseous halo with radius , @xmath54 [ kpc ] .",
    "we set the gc at the origin of cartesian space , and the galactic disk is placed on the @xmath55-plane with the sun ( i.e. , observer ) positioned at ( 8  kpc , 0 , 0 ) .    as the underlying halo gas density profile , we assume a hydrostatic isothermal model ( king profile or @xmath56 model ; king 1962 ; cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ) that follows @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gas density in @xmath59 at radius @xmath60 from the gc , @xmath61 is the density at @xmath60 = 0 , @xmath62 is the core radius , and @xmath56 is the slope of the profile at large radii . following recent studies of the structure of the gh based on x - ray data ( e.g. , miller & bregman 2013 ) , we hereafter set @xmath62 = 0.5 kpc and @xmath56 = 2/3 in this paper = 0.35@xmath63 kpc and @xmath56 = 0.71@xmath64 .",
    "we thus set the values to rounded numbers within these uncertainties .",
    "note , @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 for @xmath60 @xmath68 @xmath62 when @xmath56 = 2/3 . ] .",
    "we also assume the halo boundary at @xmath54 = 15 kpc for the purpose of this calculation .",
    "we first calculated the em profile of the gh @xmath69 bubbles for a direction of interest ( @xmath3 , @xmath6 ) from the sun by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is an element of length toward ( @xmath3 , @xmath6 ) direction ( `` filled - halo '' model ) . for comparison",
    ", we also considered a case in which two bubbles expand in the same halo by sweeping up surrounding halo gas ( `` bubble - in - halo '' model ) .",
    "we assume inner and outer radii of the bubbles , @xmath72 and @xmath73 , where the centers of the northern and southern bubbles are positioned in the @xmath74-plane ( i.e. , @xmath75 = 0 ) . for simplicity , we assumed null gas density ( @xmath76 = 0 ) inside each bubble , but the swept - up halo gas is distributed uniformly in shells with thickness @xmath42@xmath77 = @xmath73 @xmath20 @xmath72 , so that mass is conserved between two models .",
    "we remind the reader that a halo profile described above was first assumed by miller & bregman ( 2013 ) based on the x - ray data @xmath69 considering bubbles , thus assuming the same profile both in the `` filled - halo '' and `` bubble - in - halo '' models may be an oversimplification .",
    "nevertheless , we show that our model can account for the global structure of isothermal diffuse x - ray emission as detailed below .",
    "we also assumed an inclination of the northern and southern bubbles against the @xmath78-axis given by @xmath79 .",

    "the filled halo model predicts a sharp decrease of em toward high galactic latitudes , such that em at @xmath6 = 60  is more than three orders of magnitude smaller than that derived at @xmath6 = 0 . in the case of the bubble - in - halo model , by contrast , there is more structure in the variations in em which changes by only about an order of magnitude . also one can see that the inclination @xmath79 may account for a certain degree of asymmetry in the em , such that the northern bubble is spatially more extended toward high @xmath6 than the south bubble , as we see in fig.4(e ) for the case of @xmath79 = 30 .",
    "however , such a large inclination would similarly produce a high - degree of asymmetry in the gamma - ray bubbles , which strongly contradicts with the observations ( e.g. , ackermann et al .",

    "even with the simple picture and geometry assumed here , our models qualitatively explain the observed em profiles against @xmath6 , although it appears that the observations in the north bubble ( @xmath6 @xmath9 0 ) favor the ( ii ) bubble - in - halo model , whilst those of the south bubble ( @xmath6 @xmath4 0 ) favor the ( i ) filled - halo model without bubbles .",
    "observationally , this corresponds to the fact that such a bright and giant x - ray structure like the nps is unseen in the south , which is often taken as evidence supporting the idea that the nps and the rest of the loop i structure arises from a nearby supernova remnant ( see , detailed discussion in paper - i ) . however if we look at the 408 mhz radio map ( haslam et al .",
    "1982 ; also sofue 2000 ) closely , there is a southern counterpart of the nps , `` south '' polar spur visible at @xmath3 @xmath10 20  extending from ( @xmath3 , @xmath6 ) @xmath10 ( 20 , 0 ) toward ( 30 , @xmath2030 ) , although it is rather weak compared to the nps ( sofue et al .",

    ", the ratio of observed em to the filled - halo model is @xmath24  5 for the nps whilst only @xmath5  2 in the sps . as shown in fig .  4 , such a high degree of asymmetry in the north and south is difficult to explain solely by the inclination of bubbles axis against the galactic disk normal , thus suggesting an asymmetric outflow and/or initial density profile of the halo in which bubbles expand .",
    "the asymmetry of the nps and sps with respect to galactic plane can be explained by both `` local '' and `` bubble '' models . particularly as discussed in paper - i , the nps and",
    "the rest of the loop i structure may be a nearby supernova remnants ( snr ) located at a distance of 170 pc .",
    "such an asymmetry , however , can also be explained by a large - scale outflow from the gc and may not be exceptional in view of the fact that most shocked shells , such as supernova remnants and/or the gc phenomena , as well as extragalactic explosive events and bubbles , are more or less asymmetric like the nps .",
    "an alternative model would be that the gh has a structural , as well as dynamical , asymmetry with respect to the galactic plane and has an axis caused by an intergalactic wind ( sofue 1994 ; 2000 ) .",
    "if the galaxy is moving towards the northeast , e.g. , ( @xmath3 , @xmath6 ) @xmath10 ( 130 , 30 ) , where the warping of the hi gas disk is the highest observed , the northern halo will suffer from a stronger northeast wind of typically @xmath10100 km s@xmath19 , whilst the southern halo is blocked from the wind by the galactic disk .",
    "such head / tail - winds to the bubbles and/or shocked shells could cause north - south ( galactic plane ) as well as east - west ( rotation axis ) asymmetries in the sense that the north - east side is more enhanced , like in the nps . other more sophisticated modeling , including the intergalactic wind scenario , would be fruit subjects for future simulations .    in this context",
    ", one may also consider how the asymmetry of the nps and sps with respect to galactic plane can be reconciled with the symmetric appearance of the gamma - ray bubbles observed with . if the former structures are physically associated with the bubbles , x - rays comes from swept - up gas of the surrounding halo @xmath86 the bubbles that are clearly separated from the @xmath87 bubbles that emit gamma - rays .",
    "thus according to various external / initial conditions of halo gas into which the bubbles expand , the x - ray envelope can be far from being symmetric as seen in gamma - rays .",
    "moreover , by analogy with extragalactic radio lobes ( e.g. , scheuer 1995 , and discussion therein ) , the bubble angles to the line of sight are not individually constrained by the symmetric appearance of the bubbles in gamma rays ( see also the case of the gamma - ray detection of the radio lobes of cen  a ; abdo et al .",
    "the lines of sight adopted in the cartoon modeling span ranges adopted for extragalactic radio galaxies whose lobes also appear symmetric .",
    "although the global structures , metallicity , and density profile of the halo in our galaxy is still under investigation ( e.g. , miller & bregman 2013 ) , future extensive studies using the maxi - ssc ( matsuoka et al .",

    "particularly @xmath88-@xmath89 , the sixth x - ray astronomy mission in japan , carries the soft x - ray spectrometer ( sxs ; mitsuda et al .",

    "( 2015 ) reported two high - velocity metal absorption components centered at @xmath90 = @xmath20235 and + 250 km s@xmath19 from ultraviolet spectra , which can be explained with an outflow velocity of @xmath24 900 km s@xmath19 and a full opening angle of @xmath1110 .",
    "while the velocity is higher than in paper - i & ii , such a value depends on the geometry of the biconical outflow assumed in the model . in this context , we note again that a slower velocity @xmath21 @xmath10 300 km s@xmath19 , which is consistent with paper - i & ii is implied by the x - ray absorption line toward 3c  273 .",
    "moreover , the presence of another @xmath0 @xmath1 0.7 kev plasma , corresponding to @xmath21 @xmath10 600 km s@xmath19 , is reported in paper - ii . as discussed in detail in inoue et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , precise measurements of metal abundances in the halo gas will provide crucial hints for the origin of the fermi bubbles , either from the past activity of a gc - like agn or nuclear starforming activity . as @xmath88-@xmath89 will be launched in the winter of 2015",
    ", this will enable further progress toward clarifying the fermi bubbles nature .",
    "in this paper we presented a systematic analysis of x - ray data provided by _ suzaku _",
    "( 29 pointings ) and _ swift _ ( 68 pointings ) , covering sightlines through the entire spatial extent of the fermi bubbles .",
    "we showed that ( i ) the temperature of the gh is surprisingly uniform with galactic latitude with @xmath0 @xmath1 0.30@xmath70.07 kev , ( ii ) the em , in contrast , varies widely by more than an order of magnitude , gradually decreasing toward high @xmath6 , and ( iii ) that the distribution of em is asymmetric between the north and south bubbles .",
    "although the association of the x - ray emission with the bubbles is not conclusive , we compared our observations with simple models assuming ( i ) a filled halo without bubbles , whose gas density follows a hydrostatic isothermal @xmath56 model and ( ii ) a bubble - in - halo in which two identical bubbles expand within a halo forming a thick uniform shell of swept - up halo gas .",
    "we showed that a weak x - ray excess feature against filled - halo model , the sps , is evident in the south , but is rather weak compared to the nps .",
    "such a high degree of asymmetry is difficult to explain only by the effect of an inclined axis of the bubbles .",
    "this may suggest an asymmetric outflow and/or anisotropic initial density profile in - situ , although this is inconclusive based on the current x - ray data presented in this paper .",

    "<S> we present a systematic and uniform analysis of archival _ suzaku _ ( 29 pointings ; 6 newly presented ) and _ swift _ ( 68 pointings ; 49 newly presented ) data within galactic longitudes @xmath2@xmath3@xmath2 @xmath4 20  and latitude 5@xmath5 @xmath2@xmath6@xmath2 @xmath4 60 , covering the whole extent of the fermi bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the plasma temperature is constant at @xmath0 @xmath1 0.30@xmath70.07 kev , while the emission measure ( em ) varies by an order of magnitude , increasing toward the galactic center ( i.e. , low @xmath8 ) with enhancements at the north polar spur ( nps ) , se - claw and nw - clump features . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the em distribution of @xmath0 @xmath1 0.30 kev plasma is highly asymmetric in the northern and southern bubbles . </S>",
    "<S> although the association of the x - ray emission with the bubbles is not conclusive , we compare the observed em properties with simple models assuming ( i ) a filled halo without bubbles , whose gas density follows a hydrostatic isothermal model ( king profile ) and ( ii ) a bubble - in - halo in which two identical bubbles expand into the halo forming thick shells of swept halo gas . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the em profile in the north ( @xmath6 @xmath9 0 ) favors ( ii ) , whereas that of the south ( @xmath6 @xmath4 0 ) is rather close to ( i ) , but weak excess signature is clearly detected also in the south like nps ( south polar spur ; sps ) . </S>",
    "<S> such an asymmetry , if due to the bubbles , can not be fully understood only by the inclination of bubbles axis against the galactic disk normal , thus suggesting asymmetric outflow due to different environmental / initial condition . </S>"
