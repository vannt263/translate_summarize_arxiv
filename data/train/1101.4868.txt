    "in the past decennium , the field of cold atoms has witnessed the experimental realization of various new quantum coherent phenomena in ultracold gases @xcite . amongst the various systems that are being studied ,",
    "fermionic superfluids occupy a prominent role @xcite .",
    "contrary to bosonic gases , fermionic gases must form pairs between fermions in different spin states in order to form an s - wave superfluid .",
    "a fundamental question that has attracted wide attention recently , is what happens when the ratio between these different spin - states is altered , thereby creating a spin - imbalanced or polarized superfluid .",
    "this effect is akin to applying a magnetic field to a superconductor , which leads to electrons aligning their spins . in superconductors , and in condensed matter systems in general , it is difficult to control various parameters such as the polarization or the interaction strength . in ultracold gases , however , one has an unprecedented degree of control over these parameters @xcite . for instance , experimentalists can tune the interaction strength by making use of feshbach resonances ( for a review on this subject see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using this technique , the crossover from a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) superfluid to a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of bound molecules has been studied @xcite .",
    "furthermore , polarization can be created by first loading particles into one hyperfine state and subsequently applying a radio - frequency sweep to send a controlled number of particles to a different hyperfine state .",
    "this experimental liberty has led to the realization of many experiments on the imbalanced ultracold fermi gas @xcite .",
    "today , the main phases of this system , as a function of temperature , interaction strength and polarization , have been observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "one of the most fundamental effects that occurs in a polarized fermi gas is that above a critical imbalance , fermionic superfluidity ceases to exist and the system makes a transition into a normal fermi gas .",
    "this is known as the clogston - chandrasekhar limit @xcite .",
    "one important question that has emerged is whether there exist other pairing - mechanisms by which a gas of interacting fermions can accommodate polarized superfluidity .",
    "recently , there has been an intensive theoretical search for these exotic superfluid phases , such as the breached pair or sarma phase @xcite , and phase separation @xcite .",
    "another phase that has attracted wide attention is the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov phase ( fflo phase ) , that was proposed independently by fulde and ferrell @xcite and by larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite in 1964 .",
    "their idea was that a fermionic system can accommodate spin imbalance , by forming pairs with finite center - of - mass momentum .",
    "up till now , this state has never been observed . a recent paper reports indirect experimental evidence for the fflo state in one dimension ( 1d ) @xcite , but in three dimensions ( 3d ) , the fflo state has so far eluded experimental observation .",
    "this can be related to theoretical predictions , which state that the fflo state only occupies a tiny sliver of the bcs - bec crossover phase diagram @xcite .",
    "it was therefore necessary to find a new method to stabilize the fflo state in 3d .",
    "at the moment , new ideas are emerging to realize this goal .",
    "for instance , in two recent papers , it was suggested to stabilize the fflo state by the use of a 3d cubic lattice @xcite . as an alternative approach , we proposed to stabilize the fflo state in an imbalanced 3d fermi gas by adding a 1d optical potential to this system @xcite .",
    "this turned out to enhance the stability region of the fflo state by up to a factor six . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the proof of principle for this concept was established using the path integral method , but questions remained about the exact effects of the properties of the optical potential on the fflo state . in this paper , we investigate the role of the optical potential in detail .",
    "our aim here is to present results that relate closely to the experiment . to this end ,",
    "we construct and discuss the phase diagrams of an imbalanced fermi gas in 3d , subjected to a 1d optical potential , both at fixed chemical potentials and at fixed densities .",
    "subsequently , we investigate and discuss the effects of the properties of the optical potential on the bcs  superfluid state and on the fflo state . in sec .",
    "[ concept ] we outline our strategy to construct the phase diagrams at fixed chemical potentials and at fixed densities .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the competition between the bcs phase and the fflo phase in these phase diagrams , which differ qualitatively from the corresponding phase diagrams for the imbalanced fermi gas in 3d without the optical potential . in sec .",
    "[ effects ] , we investigate the effects of the parameters of the optical potential on the fflo state .",
    "furthermore , we explain the remarkable effect that the maximal polarization at which the fflo state can exist decreases when the interaction strength is increased above a certain critical value . finally in section",
    "[ conclusion ] we draw conclusions .",

    "figure [ figure2 ] also shows that when the interaction strength increases , both the boundary between the phase separation region and the fflo state and the boundary between the fflo state and the normal state , lie at higher values of polarization .",

    "if the interaction strength becomes larger than these two critical values , both the region of phase separation and the fflo region seem to shrink .",
    "this counterintuitive effect will be discussed in the next section .",

    "the points with polarization @xmath56 correspond to the fully polarized region in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] .",
    "we now have given a general overview of the phase diagrams of an imbalanced 3d fermi gas subjected to a 1d potential .",
    "in the next section we will investigate the effects of the properties of the optical potential on the fflo state .",
    "there are two parameters that determine the properties of the 1d optical potential : the potential depth @xmath45 , and the wave length @xmath42 . before discussing the effect of these parameters , it is important to know to which intervals they are limited in our current treatment . for the wave length , we take realistic values corresponding to present day experiments : @xmath57   $ ] .",
    "we have to be careful , however , when choosing values for the depth of the optical potential .",
    "there are two physical reasons to set a lower boundary to this depth .",
    "firstly , since the optical potential is described by a tight - binding dispersion relation ( eq . [ dispersion ] ) , the depth of the potential must be large enough to justify this approximation . to quantify this , we calculated the energy spectrum of a particle in a periodic potential , and compared it to the tight - binding dispersion given by ( [ dispersion ] ) . for completeness , we added a concise overview of this calculation in appendix [ appendix calc spectrum ] .",
    "this calculation shows that the error made by using expression ( [ dispersion ] ) for the dispersion is less than five percent when @xmath58 .",
    "secondly , by using the dispersion relation ( [ dispersion ] ) , we only take into account the lowest bloch band . this description is justified as long as the system has a fermi energy which lies below the second bloch band . a fermi energy that lies between the top of the first bloch band and the bottom of the second bloch band",
    "is allowed , since the dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the direction of the optical potential is still the same as in the free 3d fermi gas case .",
    "we have verified that by considering a potential depth @xmath58 , the system has a fermi energy that lies below the bottom of the second bloch band , for all cases considered in this paper .",
    "based on this analysis , we will use the lower boundary @xmath59 for the potential depth throughout the rest of this paper .",
    "there is also a reason to set an upper limit to the depth of the optical potential .",
    "when the potential becomes too deep , the 3d fermi gas will transition into a series of weakly - coupled two - dimensional ( 2d ) pancakes .",
    "such a 2d fermi gas must be described using a different renormalized interaction strength @xcite .",
    "we therefore choose @xmath45 to lie between 4  and 6 , so that both the 3d description and the tight - binding approximation are justified .",
    "we now proceed to investigate the effects of both optical potential parameters @xmath42 and @xmath45 .",
    "figure [ figure3 ] shows several phase diagrams at fixed density and polarization , for an imbalanced fermi gas in 3d subjected to a 1d potential , for various values of both parameters @xmath42 and @xmath45 .",
    "[ h ]    figure3.eps    in figs .",
    "[ figure3 ] ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) the wave length of the optical potential is varied .",
    "these three figures show that the maximal polarization at which the fflo state can exist increases when the wave length of the optical potential becomes smaller .",
    "this effect agrees with our expectations and can best be explained in terms of the fermi surfaces in momentum space .",
    "when an imbalance exists between spin - up and spin - down particles , an energy gap opens up between the fermi surfaces of the two spin species .",
    "this is akin to a zeeman - splitting effect . in order to bridge this gap and to let particles pair with the same energy , the fflo state forms pairs with a finite momentum @xmath12 . the larger the imbalance , the larger the energy gap becomes and the larger @xmath12 has to be . in ref .",
    "@xcite we demonstrated that the wave vector of the fflo state can not become larger than the wave vector of the optical potential .",
    "since a smaller wave length corresponds to a larger wave vector , the maximal value of the wave vector @xmath12 that can be attained by the fflo state increases when the wave length of the optical potential decreases .",
    "this means that a larger energy gap can be bridged and thus a larger polarization can be accommodated .",
    "figures [ figure3 ] ( c ) and [ figure3 ] ( d ) show the phase diagram of the system at the same wave length but at different potential depth . in both figures , the maximal polarization of the fflo state is equal .",
    "we conclude that only the wave length of the optical potential has an influence on the capability of the system to remain in the fflo state while being polarized , at least within the small range of potential depth @xmath45 that is considered here .",
    "one effect that is visible throughout all phase diagrams in figures [ figure2 ] and [ figure3 ] , is that when the interaction strength exceeds a certain critical value , both the region of phase separation and the fflo region become less stable with respect to polarization ( i.e. the maximal polarization at which they can exist , decreases ) .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that both the boundary between the phase separation region and the fflo state and the boundary between the fflo state and the normal state have a maximum ( indicated by a red square and a red circle respectively in figure [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , these two maxima seem to correspond to different values of the interaction strength .",
    "this effect is counterintuitive , because when the interaction strength increases , the binding energy of the fermion pairs increases likewise , which in general should strengthen superfluidity , not weaken it .",
    "this effect is explained with the help of figure [ figure2 ] . in this figure ,",
    "the empty blue squares ( normal state ) and the empty green triangles ( fflo state ) indicate that the fermi energy of the majority spins lies higher than the top of the first bloch band , which is equal to @xmath60 .",
    "the boundary at which the fermi energy of the majority spins becomes equal to the top of the first bloch band is indicated by the dashed oblique line .",
    "the maximum polarization under which the fflo state can exist ( red circle ) , lies exactly at this line .",
    "furthermore , the vertical dashed line indicates the value of the interaction strength at which the fermi energy at polarization zero becomes equal to the top of the first bloch band .",
    "this dashed vertical line intersects with the maximum polarization under which the phase separation region can exist ( red square ) .",
    "the reason why each of these two dashed lines intersects with one of the two maxima can be explained as follows .",
    "consider the case which is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] .",
    "figure [ figure4 ] ( a ) shows the fermi surface of both spin - up and spin - down particles at polarization zero . in order for the system to become superfluid , pairing occurs between particles that lie in a band with thickness @xmath11 around the fermi energy .",
    "when these pairing bands of the spin - up and spin - down particles overlap , pairing is possible and the system is in the superfluid state .",
    "when polarization is introduced , a gap arises between the two fermi surfaces , as indicated in figure [ figure4 ] ( b ) . as long as this gap is smaller than @xmath11 , there is overlap of the pairing bands , and superfluidity is possible in principle .",
    "when the polarization becomes too large , the overlap disappears and bcs superfluidity is no longer possible .",
    "in order to remain superfluid , the system can transition into the fflo state , which translates the fermi surface of the minority spins so that it locally lies on the fermi surface of the majority spins , making pairing possible again ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this allows the system to remain superfluid , at the cost of paying some energy to form particles with finite center - of - mass momentum .",
    "this is the case for a 3d fermi gas , but when a 1d potential is added , an additional effect comes into play . when the density and/or polarization is high enough so that the fermi surface of the majority spins lies at the edge of the first brillouin zone ( this is true for the area at the right side of the dashed oblique line in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) , pairing at this fermi surface becomes more difficult , because for @xmath61 , there are no available states ( see fig .",
    "[ figure4 ] ( c ) ) .",
