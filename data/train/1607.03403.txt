    "the two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg )  in a perpendicular magnetic field has a very rich phase diagram that includes several phases such as the laughlin liquids that give rise to the integer and quantum hall effectsgirvin1 , the wigner crystal at small filling factor in each landau level@xcite , the bubble crystals and the stripe phase in higher landau levels@xcite and the skyrme crystal@xcite near filling factor @xmath1 in the lowest landau level .",
    "the phase diagram is even more complex when system with extra degrees of freedom such as double quantum wells ( dqws ) are considered@xcite . in dqws",
    ", the orientation of the pseudospin vector associated with the layer degree of freedom can be modified by changing the tunneling and electrical bias between the layers .",
    "another way to modify the properties of the 2deg is by the addition of a lateral two - dimensional superlattice patterned on top of the gaas / algaas heterojunction hosting the 2deg that creates a spatially modulated potential at the position of the 2deg@xcite .",
    "the effect of a one - dimensional periodic potential on the landau levels is particularly interesting@xcite since it leads to commensurability problems due to the presence of different lengths scales : the lattice constant of the external potential @xmath11 the magnetic length @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is the magnetic field ) and the fermi wavelength .",
    "novel magnetoresistance oscillations with period different than that of the well - known shubnikov - de haas oscillations have been detected in such systems .",
    "even more interesting is the effect of a periodic two - dimensional potential on the band structure of the 2deg@xcite .",
    "the intricate pattern of eigenvalues that results from such potential has been studied by many authors and is known as the hofstadter butterfly spectrum@xcite .",
    "its observation in gaas / algaas heterojunction is very difficult due to screening and disorder effects but experimental signature in magnetotransport experiments in 2degs with a lateral surface superlattice potential with period of the order of @xmath14 nm and less have been reported@xcite .",
    "interest in this problem has been revived recently by the experimental observations of the hofstadter s butterfly spectrum that use the moir superlattices that arise from graphene or bilayer graphene placed on top of hexagonal boron nitride@xcite .",
    "another interest of superlattice potentials is their use to create artificial lattices .",
    "for example , a lateral superlattice with a honeycomb crystal structure has recently been proposed to create an artificial graphenelike system@xcite in a gaas / algaas heterojunction .    in this work ,",
    "we study theoretically the effect of a square lattice lateral potential with a period @xmath15 on the ground state of the 2deg in gaas / algaas heterojunction at filling factor @xmath1 and in landau level @xmath2 we include the spin degree of freedom and use the hartree - fock approximation to study the combined effects of the external potential and the coulomb interaction .",
    "we assume that the potential is sufficiently weak so that landau level mixing can be neglected .",
    "we also ignore disorder and work at zero temperature .",
    "we vary the potential strength @xmath3 and calculate the ground state for different rational values of @xmath16 $ ] ( where @xmath17 is the flux quantum and @xmath18 are integers with no common factors ) which is the inverse of the number of flux quanta per unit cell of the surface potential .",
    "our formalism allows for the formation of uniform as well as spatially modulated ground states with or without spin texture .",
    "our calculation indicates that , at a critical value , @xmath4 of the external potential , there is a transition from a uniform fully spin polarized state to a charge density wave ( cdw ) with an intricate spin texture .",
    "each unit cell of this cdw contains two positive and two negative amplitude modulations and the vortex spin texture at each maximum(minimum)resembles that of a positively(negatively ) charged meron .",
    "the two positively(negatively ) charged merons in each unit cell have the same vorticity but a global phase that differs by @xmath19 these meronlike textures , however , are not quantized since the amplitude of the cdw varies continuously with @xmath3 . in the vortex - cdw , as we call it , the average spin polarization @xmath5 varies with @xmath3 in a continuous or discontinuous manner depending on whether @xmath6 $ ] or @xmath20 $ ] and saturates at a finite , positive , value of @xmath5 that depends only on @xmath21 in most cases . in the special case @xmath22 the vortex - cdw phase is absent and the transition is directly from a fully spin polarized and uniform 2deg to an unpolarized cdw . the phase diagram for @xmath20 $ ] is richer than that of @xmath6 $ ] as it involves the transition between the vortex - cdw and its conjugate phase , the anti - vortex cdw , obtained by reversing @xmath23 and inverting the vorticity of all merons .",
    "this transition between the two cdws is accompanied by a discontinuous change of @xmath5 that becomes continuous when the zeeman coupling goes to zero .",
    "we study the properties of the vortex - cdw at different values of @xmath21 and with a particular emphasis on its collective excitations which we derive using the generalized random - phase approximation ( grpa ) .",
    "the vortex - cdw has collective modes that have much in common with the collective excitations of the skyrme crystal@xcite that is expected to be the ground state near filling factor @xmath1 in @xmath2 namely , the broken u(1 ) symmetry in the vortex - cdw phase leads to a new gapless mode that can provide a fast channel for the relaxation of nuclear spins@xcite .",
    "this mode and the meronlike spin texture disappear at larger values of the external potential leaving a ground state that is either unpolarized if @xmath24 or partially polarized if @xmath25    our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce the hamiltonian of the 2deg in the presence of the lateral square lattice potential and briefly review the hartree - fock and generalized random - phase approximation that we use to compute the density of states , the density and spin profiles and the collective excitations of the various phases . in sec .",
    "iii , we present our numerical results for the phase diagram of the 2deg as a function of the potential strength @xmath3 and the inverse magnetic flux per unit cell @xmath21 .",
