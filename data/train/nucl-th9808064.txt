    "these give the background to the above considered processes .",
    "this background can be in principle subtracted by simultaneous registration of strange particles in the final state .",
    "however , even without this experimentally complicated approach , one can hope to detect contributions of processes with strangeness production .",
    "let us consider the non - strange processes in more detail .",
    "some of them are easily distinguishable from those with strangeness production having different kinematics but the process @xmath204 considered in @xcite and the related processes @xmath205 , @xmath206 , considered in @xcite , occur in the same energy  momentum region .",
    "their probability is rather large .    in terms of the optical theorem formalism",
    "these processes can be interpreted as an excitation of in - medium particle  hole and @xmath112hole quanta of interaction . as well known , cf .",
    "@xcite , these quanta are strongly mixed with each other and with in - medium pionic excitations .",
    "thus , in medium these processes should be considered within the optical theorem formalism to prevent a possible double counting . calculating the rates of the non - strange processes above one has to take into account the weak - interaction renormalization due to the short - range @xmath69 and @xmath207 correlations .    in ref .",
    "@xcite these effects were partially included for the @xmath205 channel in the framework of the rpa approximation .",
    "the net effect from the correlations is a suppression by the factor @xmath208 . in the @xmath206 channel",
    "no correlations were included .",
    "we expect that a more consistent account for correlations will lead to a larger suppression effect .",
    "indeed , a rough estimation beyond rpa gives for the reaction @xmath205 the correlation factor , e.g. , in the axial current vertex @xmath209 at small transverse frequencies and transverse momenta @xmath210 , being the fermi momentum of a nucleon at the normal nuclear density .",
    "evaluating this expression with @xmath211 , being the spin - isospin landau - migdal parameter of the short - range @xmath69 interaction , we find the suppression factor for the reaction rate about @xmath212 0.10.3 . for the reaction @xmath213 ,",
    "effects due to the @xmath69 and @xmath207 correlations are less important , and the resulting suppression factor is expected to be in the range 0.50.7 .    to compare the rates of strange and non - strange channels of anti - neutrino nucleus scattering we take the results from ref .",
    "@xcite , the thin dashed curve in fig .  3 , which are close to our calculation with account for the baryon mass reduction due to the mean field interactions .",
    "with the suppression factors above we estimate that the strange and non - strange channels give contributions of the same order to the angular integrated cross section .",
    "the cross sections taken at the fixed @xmath214@xmath23 scattering angle correspond to the different kinematics and can be distinguished , thereby .",
    "we calculated the differential cross section for the anti - neutrino induced production of positive leptons on a nucleus associated with production of strangeness @xmath127 .",
    "the most important contribution is found to be given by the reaction @xmath215 , which we calculated , including weak - interaction renormalization in nuclear matter due to the short - range @xmath83 correlations taken within landau  migdal parameterization .",
    "the in - medium effects alter essentially the differential cross section at small @xmath214@xmath23 scattering angles both in the absolute value and in the shape . the total cross section changes by @xmath18210% .",
    "we also considered a contribution from the in - medium kaon production process @xmath216 .",
    "for that we evaluated the @xmath2 spectral density in nuclear matter and included the weak - coupling vertex renormalization .",
    "the latter increases the rate of positron production in this channel by factor @xmath18210@xmath217 compared to that estimated with the free weak coupling . in spite of that the contribution of the reaction channel @xmath218 to the full @xmath127 strange particle rate is @xmath219 times smaller than that of the reaction @xmath220 .",
    "thus , only a peculiar experimental analysis could allow to discriminate the contribution from this in - medium @xmath2 channel .",
    "we demonstrated that the rate of both reactions @xmath218 and @xmath220 is not given by the direct sum of the squared matrix elements of the corresponding feynman diagrams .",
    "otherwise , some processes would be counted twice .",
    "we show that this double counting problem is easily avoided in the framework of the optical theorem formalism @xcite .",
    "the closed diagram method , we demonstrated , is quite general and can be applied for any other reaction channels , e.g. , for the non - strange reaction channel , which also requires consistent inclusion of in - medium effects .",
    "both strange and non - strange contributions to the angular integrated cross sections are found to be of the same order of magnitude .",
    "however , they are related to the distinct kinematic regions at the fixed neutrino lepton scattering angle",
    ". they also can be distinguished with the help of a simultaneous identification of strange particles in the final state .",
    "the developed formalism can be utilized in investigation of other weak processes @xmath221 , @xmath222 , and @xmath223 important for neutron star physics , giving rise to hyperonization @xcite and @xmath2 condensation @xcite . the corresponding neutrino radiation can result in some observable consequences , as a jump in neutrino radiation and reheating .",
