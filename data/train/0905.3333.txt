    "in spite of all its shortcomings , the mode - coupling theory ( mct )  @xcite of the glass transition has most valuably contributed to our understanding of the slowing down of super - cooled liquids .",
    "it was the first _ ab initio _ theory to make precise , quantitative predictions about the appearance of a two - step relaxation process in super - cooled liquids and hard sphere colloids as these systems become cooler or denser .",
    "mct predicts in particular a non trivial `` @xmath0-relaxation '' regime where dynamical correlation functions pause around a plateau value before finally relaxing to zero . around this plateau value ,",
    "power - law regimes in time are anticipated , together with the divergence of two distinct relaxation times , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as the mct critical temperature @xmath3 is approached .",
    "although this divergence is smeared out by activated events in real liquids , the two - step relaxation picture suggested by mct seems to account quite well for the first few decades of the increase of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "quite remarkably , it was observed soon after by kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes  @xcite , that the mct equations in fact describe the _ exact _ evolution of the correlation function of mean - field p - spin and potts glasses  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some physical properties of these p - spin glasses ( such as the existence of an entropy crisis at a well defined temperature @xmath4 ) are tantalizingly similar to those of super - cooled liquids , even beyond the mct regime .",
    "this has led to :    * a better understanding of the physical nature of the mct transition , in terms of a `` demixing '' of the unstable saddle points of the energy landscape and the ( meta)stable minima : above a certain energy threshold @xmath5 only the former type is found , while minima all sit below this threshold ( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) . *",
    "the elaboration of a consistent phenomenological description of the glass transition , called the `` random first order transition '' ( or rfot ) theory by wolynes and collaborators  @xcite , within which the activated processes allowing the system to hop between metastable minima is given a precise interpretation in terms of spatial rearrangements .",
    "more recently , it has been argued that mct can be thought of as a landau theory of the glass transition , where the order parameter is the ( small ) time dependent difference between the correlation function and its plateau value  @xcite .",
    "it was furthermore shown that the mct transition is accompanied by the divergence of a dynamical correlation length  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , which gives a quantitative meaning ( within mct ) to the concept of heterogeneous dynamics .",
    "correspondingly , critical fluctuations are expected close to the mct transition @xmath3 , and become dominant in spatial dimensions @xmath6 , where the value of the upper critical dimension is @xmath7 or @xmath8 depending on the existence of conserved variables ( see  @xcite ) . for the model considered below , @xmath7 .    in view of the central role of the mode - coupling theory in our current understanding of the glass transition , it is somewhat surprising that so little numerical work has been devoted to models for which the mct equations are believed to be exact . to our knowledge",
    "there is in fact no exhaustive treatment of a spin model displaying an exact mct - transition .",
    "such a study is valuable for several reasons .",
    "first , it is important to know how precisely the mct predictions can be tested on a model where the theory is supposed to be exact , and for which all the excuses for mct s failures in real systems ( uncontrolled approximations , activated events , low dimensions , etc . ) are absent .",
    "second , the detailed study of finite size effects is important , since one expects in that case to observe in a controlled way the famous crossover between the mct regime and the activated regime .",
    "furthermore , since the short - range nature of the interactions in liquids should somehow lead to finite size corrections to the mct equations , the results of this analysis should bring important insights , and perhaps help to understand the somewhat unexpected results of karmakar et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "one reason explaining why these numerical studies are scarce is the slow dynamics of these models . even more so than in other spin glass models a good sampling requires a number of monte carlo iterations that grows rapidly with the system size even with an extremely efficient sampling algorithm , like the parallel tempering algorithm @xcite",
    "an other reason is that the paradigmatic p - spin model is a p - body interaction model , which only leads to mct - like dynamics for @xmath9 .",
    "altogether this leads to quite heavy simulations ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "other mean field models in the mct class exist , like the fully - connected q - states potts model ( for @xmath10 ) @xcite or the random orthogonal model ( rom )  @xcite , which are two - body spin models .",
    "but a recent detailed study of the 10-states potts model  @xcite has led to rather strange results : absence of the `` cage effect '' , unusual finite - size scaling exponent .",
    "nevertheless some behavior reminiscent of the mct - transition seems to emerge .",
    "the rom case is even worse ; there is no precise study in the temperature range close to the dynamic temperature , where all previous simulations have fallen out - of - equilibrium even for rather small system ( @xmath11  @xcite ) .",
    "our project is to provide an exhaustive numerical analysis of the statics and the dynamics of a model for which the mode coupling theory is exact .",
    "we want in particular to : ( i ) test numerically the mct predictions concerning the two - point relaxation function ( @xmath12 ) and the four - point correlation functions ( @xmath13 ) that describe dynamical heterogeneities , ( ii ) study the pre - asymptotic corrections to the critical behavior and ( iii ) analyze the finite size scaling of the mct transition .",
    "+ to achieve such a program , one needs a two - body model with well - separated static ( @xmath14 ) and dynamic ( @xmath3 ) transition temperatures .",
    "we have found that a certain variant of the rom satisfies these constraints .",
    "we also need an efficient algorithm , since the rom turns out to be an extremely difficult model to simulate .",
    "if one uses a simple algorithm like thermal annealing , the convergence is so poor that the average energy never goes below @xmath5 below @xmath3 , even for small system sizes . in this work",
    "we will use the best algorithm to date for spin glass numerical simulations , namely the _ parallel tempering _",
    "algorithm @xcite . in spite of tremendous numerical efforts , we are still limited to rather small systems ( up to @xmath15 spins )",
    "however , our simulations allow us to reach an interesting but somewhat unexpected conclusion : preasymptotic corrections and finite size effects are so strong that a direct observation of the mct predictions is extremely difficult .",
    "great care must be exercised to extract meaningful value of critical exponents , even for a model for which mct is in principle exact !",
    "such problems are expected to arise in the analysis of experimental data as well , and we believe that our work highlights some caveats concerning the validity and relevance of mct in practice .",
    "our first main result consists in establishing that pre - asymptotic effects are extremely important until one approaches the mct transition temperature up to fractions of percent !",
    "we show this effect in two ways : ( a ) our numerical simulations of the rom unveil that several of the mct predictions are still not verified quantitatively for temperatures a few percent higher than the critical one ; ( b ) we solve numerically the schematic mode coupling theory equations and show that very similar conclusions are also reached in this framework .",
    "similar findings were obtained in @xcite by comparing mct to experimental data .",
    "our second main result is a detailed study of finite size scaling of the mct transition .",
    "this is both of practical and theoretical interest when one attempts to determine some mct exponents .",
    "we find that sample to sample fluctuations play a crucial role .",
    "as we shall explain , thermal fluctuations would lead naturally to finite size effects that becomes relevant for distance from the critical temperature of the order @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the system size . however , disorder fluctuations , that is sample to sample fluctuations of the dynamic temperature , are of order @xmath18 .",
    "the latter fluctuations therefore dominate and lead to a very subtle finite size scaling behavior .",
    "our study lead us to a generalization of the harris criterion suitable for disordered systems above their upper critical dimension .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after recalling the main predictions of the replica method ( for the statics ) and of the mct ( for the dynamics ) in section  [ sec:2 ]",
    ", we discuss our numerical results for the statics of the rom in section  [ sec:3 ] . in  [ sec : dyn ] , we investigate the equilibrium dynamics of the model and compare the results with the predictions of mct .",
    "we show that the glaring discrepancies come from the unexpectedly narrow critical window around the mct transition point , which we can not access numerically without large finite size effects .",
    "we then turn in section  [ sec:4 ] to a detailed study of these finite size effects , and to the possibility of using dynamical finite - size scaling for this model .",
    "we find that naive finite - size scaling theory fails to account for our results , because of the strong sample to sample dependence of the critical temperature .",
    "we show how to understand phenomenologically our results in the rest of section  [ sec:4 ] , relegating to appendices more precise statements on the apparent breakdown of the harris criterion in high dimensions , and the exact solution of the fully - connected disordered blume - capel model , which provides an explicit illustration of our arguments .",
    "the last section is dedicated to the conclusion and open questions .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the starting point of the random first order theory of the glass transition is the analysis of the so - called discontinuous spin glasses , namely mean field disordered models with an order parameter that has a jump at the transition . in terms of the replica method , these are the ones solved by the so - called one - step replica symmetry breaking ansatz ( 1-rsb , see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "examples are the p - spin ( spherical ) model and the random orthogonal model that we are going to study in detail in the following .",
    "the physical behavior of these models is particularly transparent in terms of the thouless - anderson - palmer ( tap ) @xcite approach that allows to analyze the free energy landscape of the model .",
    "technically , this is a legendre transform of the free energy as a function of all the local magnetizations .",
    "the minima of the tap free energy correspond to the thermodynamic states of the system , like the two minima of the curie - weiss free energy represent the two low temperature ferromagnetic states in the ( completely connected ) ising model .    for a 1-rsb system",
    ", the analysis of the number @xmath19 of solutions of the tap equations that contribute to the free energy density shows that there exists two transition temperatures : one static ( @xmath14 ) and the second dynamic ( @xmath3 ) , with @xmath20 .",
    "when @xmath21 or @xmath22 , the complexity , defined as @xmath23 , vanishes in the large @xmath17 limit ( @xmath17 is the total number of spins ) . above @xmath3 ,",
    "this is because the energy is higher than the threshold value @xmath5 mentioned in the introduction , so that typical states are unstable saddles , hence the system is in a paramagnetic state . below @xmath14 ,",
    "this is because the low lying amorphous minima are not numerous enough . actually , the thermodynamic transition is precisely due to the vanishing of the complexity at @xmath14 . below @xmath14 the system is in the so - called 1-rsb phase ( correspondingly the high temperature phase is called replica symmetric ( rs ) ) . for @xmath24 ,",
    "on the other hand , the complexity takes a finite nonzero value . in other words , between @xmath14 and @xmath3 ,",
    "an exponential number of metastable states contributes to the free energy . in this temperature range ,",
    "the system is already not ergodic since a configuration starting in one of these multiple states and evolving with say , langevin dynamics remains trapped inside the initial state forever ( i.e. on all timescales not diverging with the system size ) .",
    "when approaching @xmath3 from above , the majority of the stationary points of the tap free energy , which are unstable above @xmath3 , become marginally stable at @xmath3 and stable below .",
    "one therefore expects a slowing down of the dynamics due to the rarefaction of descending directions in the free energy landscape  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the dynamics of some of these models , e.g. the p - spin spherical model , can be analyzed exactly .",
    "one can show , from the dynamical equation for the spin - spin time - dependent equilibrium correlation functions , that at @xmath3 an infinite plateau appears in the dynamical overlap @xmath12 defined as : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the spin at site @xmath27 .",
    "remarkably , the integro - differential equations derived with the mode coupling theory of glasses for the density - density correlation functions reduce identically within the so - called schematic approximation  @xcite to the equation obeyed by @xmath12 .",
    "the solution of the equation for @xmath12 ( or the more complicated full mct equations )  @xcite leads to a two - step relaxation for the correlation function : there is a first rapid decay from 1 towards a plateau value @xmath28 , then a slow evolution around it ( the @xmath0 regime ) and , eventually , a very slow decay from it ( the @xmath29 relaxation ) .",
    "the plateau value is called the edwards - anderson parameter , in analogy with spin glasses . for our present purpose",
    ", we will be interested in these two last regimes .    at a given temperature @xmath21 ,",
    "the dynamics in the @xmath0-regime is described by power - laws .",
    "the approach to the plateau can be written as @xmath30 , and the later departure from the plateau as @xmath31 .",
    "the exponents @xmath32 and @xmath33 are model dependent , but satisfy the universal relation  @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the gamma function . in the @xmath29-regime , close to @xmath3 , @xmath12 verifies a scaling law , called time - temperature superposition in the structural glass literature : @xmath36 this scaling form allows one to superpose on a single curve the data for different values of time and temperature .",
    "a good fit of the function @xmath37 is obtained with a stretched exponential @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath29 relaxation time @xmath1 diverges at the transition @xmath39 , as : @xmath40    the dynamical correlation @xmath12 is the order parameter of the dynamical mct transition .",
    "recently , especially in connection with the phenomenon of dynamical heterogeneity in glass - formers  @xcite , there has been a lot of interest in the critical fluctuations and dynamical correlations associated with this transition . a central observable introduced in  @xcite",
    "is the four - point susceptibility @xmath13 , which measures the thermal fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath12 : @xmath41 where , as usual , the brackets denote a thermal average and the over - line denotes an average over the quenched random couplings . for mean field glass models , or more generally for mct ( without conservation laws ) , one can show that the four - point correlation function becomes critical near the mct transition temperature @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath0-regime , and with @xmath42 , @xmath43 and in the @xmath29-regime , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are two scaling functions , with the following properties : @xmath47 when @xmath48 and scales like @xmath49 when @xmath50 ; @xmath46 scales like @xmath49 for @xmath51 and vanishes for large @xmath52 ( note that the large time limit of @xmath13 is equal to the spin - glass susceptibility which is not critical at @xmath3 ) . using the definition of @xmath53 , and equation ( [ eq : exp ] ) ,",
    "the numerical analysis of @xmath13 very close to @xmath3 allows , at least in principle , to extract all the mct - exponents without having to know the value of @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "finally , in  @xcite it has been shown that mct can be interpreted as a mean field approximation of a critical model . following this point of view",
    ", one can compute , within this mean field theory , the spatial dynamical correlations and the associated diverging correlation length at the transition @xmath54 .",
    "it can be established that @xmath55 with @xmath56 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the upper critical dimension of the theory turns out to be @xmath57 for dynamics without exactly conserved variables  @xcite .",
    "the rom  @xcite is a fully - connected spin model with quenched disorder , defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a diagonal matrix whose elements are equal to @xmath60 and are drawn according to : @xmath61 and @xmath62 is an orthogonal matrix distributed with respect to the haar measure ( that we generated numerically by using the nag routine g05qaf ) , @xmath63 is a real number @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "the will use later the notation @xmath65 to denote a given instance of the disorder .",
    "the original model corresponds to @xmath66 .",
    "the normalisation is such that @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "a detailed analysis for arbitrary @xmath63 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "both the static and the dynamic temperatures depend on @xmath63 ( see  @xcite for more details ) . in the following , @xmath63",
    "is set to @xmath69 .",
    "this gives us higher transition temperatures than for @xmath66 with a good separation of @xmath14 and @xmath3 : @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively . with this value of @xmath63",
    ", the annealed entropy vanishes at a temperature close to @xmath14 ( for @xmath72 the annealed entropy vanishes exactly at @xmath14 ) .",
    "the static order parameter of the 1-rsb transition is the usual static overlap @xmath73 between two replicas , i.e. two equilibrium configurations @xmath74 and @xmath75 characterized by the same quenched disorder .",
    "its probability distribution function can be written as : @xmath76 in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath77 for @xmath78 , two different replicas have zero overlap with probability one . in the low temperature ( 1-rsb )",
    "phase @xmath22 , a second delta function peak centered at a value @xmath79 appears with a weight @xmath80 . to wit",
    ", two different replicas may have a mutual overlap @xmath81 with probability m , and @xmath82 with probability @xmath80 .",
    "the edwards - anderson order parameter @xmath83 is equal to @xmath84 .",
    "note that the shape of @xmath85 is only sensitive to the thermodynamics , and for @xmath24 , @xmath86 like in the the rs phase .",
    "the rom is strongly discontinuous : the value of @xmath84 jumps sharply from 0 to a value close to 1 at the static transition ( see figure  [ fig:011 ] ) below .",
    "this , together with the wide separation between @xmath14 and @xmath3 , are strong cases to use the rom , as compared to the p - spin model  @xcite or the potts glass  @xcite .",
    "both these models have unfortunately very close static and dynamic transition temperatures .",
    "let us start by giving some details about our simulations .",
    "we study systems with @xmath87 and @xmath15 spins .",
    "we thermalize the system using the parallel tempering optimized monte carlo procedure  @xcite , with a set of 100 temperatures in the range @xmath88 $ ] ( @xmath89 for @xmath90 and @xmath91 for @xmath92 ) , except for the largest system where a smaller set of 35 temperatures has been used , in order to save computer time ( with @xmath93 and @xmath94 ) .",
    "these parameters have been chosen empirically and no claim is made that they are optimal . as usual , the program simulates the independent evolution of two clones / replicas , in order to compute the static overlap @xmath73 .",
    "we perform @xmath95 parallel tempering iterations ( one iteration consists of one metropolis sweep of all spins , followed by one tempering update cycle of all pairs of successive temperatures ) . the second half of the equilibration procedure is used to measure the static quantities .",
    "the results of this procedure are presented in the following subsections ( see subsections  [ subsec:3 - 1 ] and  [ subsec:3 - 2 ] ) .",
    "we then store the final hopefully well - equilibrated configurations . due to the difficulty to equilibrate large systems , we restrict ourselves to @xmath21 to study the finite size dependence of the dynamics .",
    "we also restrict the number of temperatures to 25 , equally distributed between 0.178 and 0.29 ( @xmath94 ) , for all system sizes .",
    "we then perform @xmath96 pure metropolis sweeps and measure @xmath12 , the overlap between the well equilibrated initial configuration , and the configuration at time @xmath97 .",
    "we then perform @xmath98 parallel tempering iterations in order to have a new , well de - correlated , starting point , and repeat the procedure 100 times .",
    "this gives us for each disorder samples @xmath99 thermally independent estimates of the dynamical overlap @xmath12 , this is large enough to obtain a reliable estimate of the non - linear susceptibility @xmath100 .",
    "the number of disorder samples @xmath101 is @xmath102 for all sizes .",
    "let us mention that we have also studied the model obtained by projecting the elements of the matrix @xmath103 to @xmath60 .",
    "the motivation was that in this case one could use an efficient multi - spin coding technique  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting model displays a very different physics , with @xmath104-rsb breaking , and is accordingly not suitable for our purpose .",
    "this is an illustration of the fragility of the rom model with respect to perturbations .",
    "disordered systems are notoriously difficult to simulate , and it is crucial to ensure good quality sampling , and in particular good thermalization .",
    "there is unfortunately no full - proof heuristics for this purpose .",
    "the heuristics we use for this simulation is to check that the fluctuation - dissipation relation , relating the specific heat to the variance of the internal energy , is satisfied .",
    "this is a very stringent test ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and we have checked in the case of the sk model that it is consistent with other methods used in the literature .",
    "we define the ratio @xmath105 as : @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the energy density .",
    "@xmath105 vanishes when the configurations are well sampled .",
    "our data for @xmath105 ( with @xmath107 as measured in the second half of our thermalization runs ) as a function of @xmath108 can be found in figure  [ fig:002 ] for system sizes @xmath109 up to @xmath15 .",
    "( see equation  [ r ] for the precise definition ) as a function of the temperature , for @xmath109 up to @xmath110 .",
    "we note that for all vales of @xmath17 , @xmath105 fluctuates around zero , namely the systems are well equilibrated , except for the largest size ( @xmath110 ) where the system fall out of equilibrium below @xmath111 . ]",
    "the results are very satisfactory for all temperatures up to @xmath112 . for the largest system size however ,",
    "the sampling is clearly not good enough below @xmath3 , in spite of intensive numerical efforts .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the cases of the sk and potts glass models where values of @xmath17 up to a few thousands can be handled with the parallel tempering algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the modest efficiency of the parallel tempering algorithm when applied to the rom can be directly observed by studying how the main thermodynamic observables reach their equilibrium values .",
    "starting from a random initial configuration for the two clones ( we take @xmath113 ) , we plot the instantaneous value of the considered observable , averaged over the disorder , in order to tame the fluctuations .",
    "the results for the internal energy ( @xmath114 ) and for the overlap between the two clones ( @xmath115 ) are given in figure  [ fig:101 ] , for @xmath116 .",
    "this figure suggest a power - law behaviour @xmath117 in the large @xmath17 limit , with a non uniform convergence .",
    "the smaller the value of @xmath17 , the earlier in time do the data deviates from the power law behavior . for large @xmath97 ,",
    "the relaxation becomes strongly @xmath17 dependent , smaller systems relax much faster .",
    "a power - law relaxation of the energy at @xmath3 is in fact expected on theoretical ground .",
    "the value of the exponent was recently conjectured by a. lefvre ( private communication ) to be equal to @xmath32 , the mct exponent defined above .",
    "this is compatible with our finding since , as we shall find later , @xmath118 for the rom .",
    "and @xmath15 at @xmath119 , just above @xmath3 .",
    "the apparent power law behavior @xmath120 is only valid in the early time region .",
    "one notes that even ( slightly ) above @xmath3 , the relaxation is extremely slow and equilibration is quite difficult to achieve ( one needs a couple of @xmath121 monte carlo sweeps in order to equilibrate the internal energy for @xmath110 ) .",

    "we used the same color code of figure  1.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the slow relaxation of the internal energy , even for @xmath21 , illustrates why this is a hopeless task to simulate the rom below ( and near ) @xmath3 for reasonable system sizes . the much faster relaxation of the overlap can be understood with the following argument : the two clones starts at the top of a very rugged energy landscape .",
    "after a few sweeps , they have started falling down in directions , or towards , traps whose probable overlap is zero .",
    "this leads to a fast decorrelation of @xmath115 . instead , in order to equilibrate the internal energy",
    ", one has to visit many different traps in order to have a good statistical sampling of all energy states , which is a much more slow process .",
    "many reasons can be invoked to explain the poor performances of the parallel tempering algorithm applied to the rom .",
    "the first one is that the temperature in the interesting region is in fact extremely low , leading to extremely small metropolis and exchange acceptance rates .",
    "a way to gauge the smallness of the rom transition temperature is to study the spin - glass susceptibility @xmath122 as a function of the temperature ( see figure  [ fig:004 ] ) .",
    "when @xmath123 , @xmath124 must tend to unity , but strong corrections are still present up to @xmath125 .",
    "this is expected , since the leading non trivial @xmath126 correction to @xmath124 is the same in the rom and sk models , because the variance of the @xmath127 is normalized to the same value in both cases .",
    "however , the critical temperature of the sk model is @xmath128 , ten times larger than the critical temperature of the rom .     to @xmath15 .",
    "one observes ( a ) strong size - dependence effect below @xmath71 and ( b ) an extremely slow convergence towards its asymptotic @xmath129 value . in the inset",
    "@xmath130 is plotted for high temperatures up to @xmath131 together with the asymptote @xmath132 .",
    "this illustrates how `` cold '' the rom glassy phase is .",
    "we used the same color code of figure  1 . ]",
    "a deeper explanation relies on the physics of 1-rsb models , recalled in the above section .",
    "the existence of numerous metastable states in the range [ @xmath14,@xmath3 ] slows down dramatically the dynamics .",
    "indeed , in order to have a decent sampling , one should explore a representative subset of all the metastable states .",
    "the complexity of the rom has been computed in the thermodynamic limit in  @xcite .",
    "it shows a sharp jump from @xmath134 to a finite value below @xmath3 , and thus the log of the number of states that must be explored jumps from @xmath134 to a number of order @xmath17 at @xmath3 .",
    "it does not come as a surprise that the algorithm fails below @xmath3 even for moderate values of @xmath17 .",
    "a precise understanding of why the rom case is so much difficult than the potts and p - spin cases is still lacking .",
    "a reasonable conjecture is that this is due to fact that the overlap value is so close to unity .",
    "another system where this happens , and where the dynamics is indeed painfully slow , is the bernasconi model ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note , en passant , that applied to the model with binarized exchange couplings briefly mentioned above , the parallel tempering works brilliantly .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig:001 ] our data for the internal energy per spin , defined as @xmath135 as a function of the temperature , together with the theoretical result obtained in  @xcite . for our special choice of @xmath63 ,",
    "one finds : @xmath136 the numerical data for @xmath137 is qualitatively consistent with the infinite - volume analytical results , up to the finite size corrections , with the marked exception of the @xmath110 data below @xmath3 , which are at odds with the rest of the picture .",
    "this is in agreement with our previous observation that the @xmath110 systems are not at equilibrium at low temperature and should be discarded there .",
    "the temperature below which the fluctuation - dissipation relation is violated indeed roughly coincides with the one below which the numerical values of @xmath137 become manifestly wrong .    after discarding the bad data",

    "we therefore qualitatively understand the anomalous fss result obtained in section  [ sec:4 - 0 ] , in particular the fact that @xmath277 is larger than the naive value @xmath278 .",

    "the transition temperature for the rom is very low compared to the scale of the interactions ; this implies that the transition is very strongly discontinuous , with an edwards - anderson order parameter very close to unity as soon as @xmath367 .",
    "we have then studied the equilibrium dynamics of the model , focusing on the time correlation function and the four - point dynamical susceptibility , which measures the strength of dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "when comparing our numerical results to the predictions of mct , we find that while some of these predictions are quantitatively obeyed ( like approximate time temperature superposition in the late @xmath0 regime ) , other important ones are clearly violated , with inconsistent values of the mct exponents .",
    "this is due to strong pre - asymptotic effects .",
    "indeed , we have shown that the asymptotic mct predictions are only valid inside an unusually narrow sliver around @xmath3 , thereby explaining these quantitative discrepancies and allowing one to get rough estimates of the mct exponents for the rom : @xmath258 and @xmath368 .",
    "working closer to @xmath3 to get rid of these strong preasymptotic corrections is hampered by equally strong finite size corrections .",
    "on that front , more surprises emerge : we find that the usual finite size scaling ( fss ) fails to account for our data , a result that we rationalize in terms of strong sample to sample fluctuations of the critical temperature .",
    "we have developed a phenomenological theory for fss in the presence of these strong fluctuations .",
    "this modified form of fss accounts well for our results ; we also show that naive fss works for individual samples .",
    "en passant , we have also developed new arguments to understand fss in disordered systems above their upper critical dimension ( see appendices ) .    the compatibility between the mct predictions and the numerical behavior of a model that is in principle exactly described by mct turned out to be extremely difficult to establish quantitatively , partly because of the impossibility to equilibrate large systems .",
    "the situation is expected to be worse when dealing with experimental data for which the critical temperature is blurred by non - mean field effects . in this case , quantitative comparison with mct requires extreme care , to say the least .",
    "our results show that some predictions appear to be more robust than others and this provides some guidance when dealing with application of mct to experimental or numerical data .",
    "indeed , we notice that the kind of violations of mct predictions found in our study resemble very much what found in real liquids , see e.g. the difference between the time evolution of @xmath100 and @xmath369 in @xcite .    on a different front , our results maybe relevant for fss studies of super - cooled liquids  @xcite .",
    "in this case it has been shown that the usual theory valid for pure systems fails in account the finite size scaling behavior  @xcite .",
    "although several justification can be put forward , in particular that the correlation length is not much larger than the microscopic length , our results suggest that new phenomena might be at play .",
    "in fact , if the dynamically self - induced disorder present in super - cooled liquids plays somehow the role of the quenched disorder present for the rom , as often proposed , then strong disorder fluctuations could lead to violation of usual fss .",
    "results qualitatively similar to the one reported in @xcite ( such as e.g. figure  [ fig:004 ] ) are indeed expected for the rom .",
    "it would be certainly worth to pursuing further the comparative study of fss in the rom and real liquids .",
    "finally , the study of a finite - range rom that replicates the phenomenology of finite dimensional supercooled liquids is an interesting project that we are currently pursuing , in particular to test the predictions of the random first order theory on a physical model that is as close as possible to its theoretical idealization .",

    "in the following we shall consider the role of disorder on finite size scaling above the upper critical dimension .",
    "this will lead us to formulate two different harris criteria : one valid for the fss and the other for the critical exponents , obtained from susceptibilities in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "let us consider a pure system that is perturbed by the addition of small quenched disorder . as usual , we will focus on a disorder that couples to the energy , e.g. random couplings . as a consequence ,",
    "samples of size @xmath17 will be characterized by fluctuations of the critical temperature @xmath370 .    in order to understand whether disorder affects the fss behavior one has to compare the above fluctuations with the fss window . above",
    "the the upper critical dimension fss is subtle @xcite : the scaling variable is @xmath371 where @xmath372 is the mean field exponent , @xmath373 and @xmath261 is the upper critical dimension , see @xcite for a numerical check in five dimension for the ising model .",
    "this means that properties of a pure finite systems depart from the ones expected in the thermodynamic limit when the distance from the critical temperature becomes smaller than @xmath374 . assuming that on scales such that @xmath375 the fluctuations of the critical temperature are of the order @xmath376 , one finds that for @xmath377 and close enough to the critical point , the addition of a small quenched disorder will therefore make fluctuates @xmath378 on a scale much larger than the fss window of the pure system implying that the fss behavior will be drastically affected by adding an infinitesimal disorder .",
    "this provides a generalization of the harris criterion for fss properties of systems above their upper critical dimension . as we shall show , contrary to what happens below @xmath261 , a _",
    "different _ harris criterion establishes when the disorder changes the critical properties of an infinite system .    in order to investigate whether an infinitesimal disorder affects the critical properties ,",
    "let s focus on the critical behavior of a generic local observable @xmath379 , e.g. the average local energy in @xmath52 .",
    "a simple way to establish the harris criterion consists in studying the perturbation induced by the disorder to the critical behavior .",
    "if the correction , no matter how small it is , ends to be the dominant contribution close to @xmath380 this means that the disorder is relevant .",
    "calling @xmath381 the random coupling at site @xmath382 one obtains that the corrections due to the disorder are : @xmath383    this is a random variable whose typical value is given by @xmath384 where @xmath245 is the very small variance of the random couplings , @xmath385 .    below the upper critical dimension , just by scaling or using more refined techniques @xcite , one knows that for the pure critical systems @xmath386 where @xmath387 is the exponent characterizing the singular part of @xmath379 , which is @xmath388 .",
    "these will become dominant with respect to the pure critical behavior @xmath389 when @xmath390 , no matter how small is @xmath245 , if one is close enough to the critical point .",
    "this is the standard harris criterion . what does it change above the upper critical dimension",
    "actually , the previous derivation can be repeated identically . the only step where we used that @xmath391 is the assumption on the power law behavior of the response function @xmath392 .",
    "above @xmath261 , one could just use the mean field critical power law behavior .",
    "this already would suggest that the harris criterion for the critical properties is different from the one for fss .",
    "however , the analysis is tricky because above @xmath261 one finds that subleading corrections to the critical behavior dominate the sum in ( [ fluct - dis ] ) .",
    "let us consider for instance the @xmath393 field theory describing the ising ferromagnetic transition and let us take @xmath394 .",
    "we consider that the random couplings lead to a fluctuating mass in the field theory , i.e. the disorder couples directly to @xmath379 . in this case",
    "the response function @xmath395 reads below @xmath378 and for @xmath396 : @xmath397 where @xmath398 and @xmath399 are two constants .",
    "although approaching @xmath378 keeping @xmath400 finite the first term is the leading one in the above expression , one finds that the sum in ( [ fluct - dis ] ) is dominated by the second term . within mean field theory @xmath401 vanishes linearly with the temperature at the transition , hence we finds that the disorder affects the critical properties for @xmath402 .",
    "we verified that this results holds in more general cases like @xmath403 field theories and with more general bare propagators .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that it holds in general above the upper critical dimension .    in summary ,",
    "we have found two different harris criteria .",
    "the most important physical consequence is that in large enough dimension ( @xmath404 ) critical properties of an infinite system will not be affected by an infinitesimal disorder whereas the fss maybe affected even in the infinite dimensional limit depending on the value of the ratio @xmath405 .    in the following appendix",
    "we will give a solvable example of the above scenario , namely the disordered blume - capel model .",
    "the relevance of sample to sample fluctuations is quite natural .",
    "however , one can be surprised that they affect the dynamical finite - size scaling and not the thermodynamics . in order to understand in detail , in a concrete example , the general arguments formulated above we will consider the following model defined by the hamiltonian : @xmath406 the @xmath407 s are independent , identically distributed random variables .",

    "one can investigate the role of disorder .",
    "it is well - known that the pure model , @xmath410 , has a tri - critical point characterized by a correlation length exponent @xmath412 and an upper dimension @xmath413 , that is @xmath414  @xcite .",
    "so this is indeed a case where the arguments of the previous section predict that in high dimension the critical properties will not be affected by disorder contrary to fss .",
    "our exact solution will confirm explicitly this result .",

    "more precisely , its locus is given by : @xmath423 in the thermodynamic limit this gives back the tri - critical point of the pure model : @xmath424 .",

    "as sketched in subsection  [ sec:4 - 1 ] , averaging on the disorder is here strictly equivalent to average on the distribution of tri - critical temperatures : @xmath437    for instance , let us detail the computation of the fluctuations of the order parameter @xmath438 defined as : @xmath439 using the definition of @xmath440 , one gets for a given disorder realization : @xmath441 with , @xmath442 and in a more transparent form : @xmath443 as expected , the tail exponent of the scaling function are those one would have find if one had computed the magnetization by steepest descent .",
