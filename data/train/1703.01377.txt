    "the spread of massive online open courses ( moocs ) and global learning environments like khan academy changed the educational research irreversibly .",
    "more data allows researchers and practitioners to design and build tailored learning experience .",
    "however , it has also broaden the gap between classical educational science and data - driven educational research .",
    "we aim to construct a unifying framework . in this study , we approach two research questions in the context of adaptive learning :    1",
    ".   do student features derived through data mining coincide with findings from educational studies ? 2 .",
    "can we suggest learning activities based solely on features derived through machine learning ?",
    "for today , the approaches to adaptive learning can be summarized by two main branches , hereafter referred to as the cronbach line and the markov line .",
    "the first one is supported by classical educational research and statistical methods , whereas the latter corresponds to the black - box data mining approach .",
    "we use these two names as flags that represent a certain approach to adaptation , even if we do not focus for instance on markov chains .",
    "research in education gave rise to so - called aptitude - treatment interaction laws @xcite , which specify that different learners benefit from different pedagogical strategies .",
    "we distinguish , among others , high - aptitude versus low - aptitude learners , highly motivated versus poorly motivated , anxious versus self - confident , field - dependent versus field independent learners , or surface versus deep learners .",
    "all these categorisations are based on experimental results , but the variety of factors hinders the development of unifying applications .",
    "conversely , markov line takes into account the whole variety of features .",
    "researchers skip the interpretation step and build models which optimize the learning gain , given the features of a student .",
    "since it is impossible to adapt independently to every single student , we define so - called learning profiles - groups of students with similar characteristics .",
    "now , when we know how a given profile reacts to certain activities , for a new student of that profile we can suggest the best set of activities .     two main approaches to adaptation , scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "the idea of computer - supported adaptive education dates back to early research in artificial intelligence ( ai ) .",
    "several ai approaches were successfully applied , among others : 1 ) * recommender systems * , systems which for given set of features and actions suggest learning materials , 2 ) * adaptive systems * , a general branch where activities are adapted to a given student , 3 ) * evolutive systems * , learning environments which change in time during the learning , depending on actions of a student @xcite . for an extensive survey of data mining techniques used in educational applications",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we design an experiment with four different learning scenarios as illustrated in figure [ img : experiment ] . learning profile is determined by the psychological test described below .",
    "we design a small space of loosely correlated behavioral features , so that we can test different scenarios for similar users , with a relatively small sample of participants .",
    "the experiment design.,scaledwidth=47.0% ]      we ask questions related to different aspects of a person : psychological , demographic or iq estimation .",
    "we list them together with the corresponding rating system in table [ tbl : test ] . openness and conscientiousness",
    "are proven to be correlated to a person s motivation to learn @xcite , thus we hypothesise that different activities depending on values of these features can be beneficial .    for the collection of demographic information",
    ", we ask participants about their age , country , gender and the level of education ( `` havent graduated high school '' , `` high school graduate '' , `` apprenticeship '' , `` college student '' , `` bachelors '' , `` masters '' , `` doctorate '' ) .",
    "we teach the concept of `` epidemics '' broken down to two concepts taught in the following order by two consecutive activities : a ) epidemics definition and its causes , b ) epidemics reproductive number .",
    "an activity is either reading an encyclopedia - style text ( _ text _ ) or watching a video from a mooc@xcite ( _ video _ ) .",
    "we developed a web platform@xcite which executes the work - flow presented in figure [ img : experiment ] .",
    "pre - test is the same as the post - test . for each student",
    "we measure the learning gain as a difference between the results from the tests .",
    "a user can not take navigate back , but he is free to replay or navigate through a video .",
    "we gathered a total of 167 participants but only 77 of them accomplished both pre - test and post - test .",
    "as our goal is to analyse the learning gain , we work with these 77 users . among them",
    ", we have 25 female user and 52 male user .",
    "we have the following distribution for the possible learning paths : 1 ) _ text - text _ ( 27 users ) , 2 ) _ text - video _ ( 20 users ) , 3 ) _ video - text _ ( 12 users ) and 4 ) _ video - video _ ( 18 users ) . in this study",
    "we focus on extreme unimodal scenarios : _ video - video _ and _ text - text_.        in our preliminary study , we plot each collected variable against the learning gain achieved by the learner and compare it for the obtained paths .",
    "figure [ opennessplot ] shows that , in the _ video - video _ path , the more open the learner is , the higher learning gain the learner gets . on the other hand ,",
    "the _ text - text _ path seems to have the opposite trend .",
    "these results confirm a correlation between openness and a person s learning experience .",
    "the difference for the two learning paths shows that the openness feature could contribute to choosing the best activity for a learner .",
    "our results are in line with studies on the openness , which indicates a partially positive answer to q1 . such or even more implicit features can be extracted automatically with large sample at hand , what leads to a confirmatory answer to q2 .",
    "we consider these results as encouraging to continue research in this direction ."
