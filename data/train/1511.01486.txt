    "<S> we study supercurrent and proximity vortices in a josephson junction made of disordered surface states of a three - dimensional topological insulator with a proximity induced in - plane helical magnetization . in a regime where the rotation period of helical magnetization is larger than the junction width , we find supercurrent @xmath0-@xmath1 crossovers as a function of junction thickness , magnetization strength , and parameters inherent to the helical modulation and surface states . </S>",
    "<S> the supercurrent reversals are associated with proximity induced vortices , nucleated along the junction width , where the number of vortices and their locations can be manipulated by means of the superconducting phase difference and the parameters mentioned above . </S>"
