    "the advent of the quark model allowed to put much order into the plethora of elementary particles and resonances . during much time the quark model with three quarks for the baryons and @xmath18 for the mesons was the standard picture .",
    "the panorama evolved with the time , giving rise to more complex configurations and even pentaquarks and heptaquarks for the baryons or tetraquarks for the mesons ( see recent reviews in @xcite ) . yet , the growing number of states and accumulation of data has revealed that there are even more complex structures . a turning point in this direction",
    "was the introduction of chiral dynamics to study meson - meson and meson - baryon interaction , which produced as a surprise that many known resonances , called dynamically generated , were coming as a natural consequence of the hadron - hadron interaction , much is the way as the deuteron appears as a simple bound state of a proton and a neutron . by evaluating the kernel from the chiral lagrangian @xcite , the coupled channel approach implementing unitarity",
    "explains successfully the experimental data and properties of the light scalar mesons @xcite , @xmath19 , etc , and the light baryons @xcite , two @xmath20 , etc .",
    "extrapolation of this dynamics to the charm sector has also produced many meson states , as the @xmath21 , etc @xcite , as well as baryon states like the @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "when the interaction involves vector mesons , the natural extrapolation is the use of the local hidden gauge lagrangians @xcite , which include pseudoscalar and vector mesons , incorporating chiral symmetry and providing the interaction of the vector mesons , or vector mesons with baryons ( see recent review @xcite ) .    under the su(3 ) symmetry , the local hidden gauge lagrangian with the coupled channel unitary approach can explain the structure , properties and dynamics of many states which are confirmed in the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite . with this formalism , the @xmath23 interaction is studied in @xcite , and provides a natural explanation of the meson states @xmath24 and @xmath25 and obtains the masses and widths of the two particles in fair agreement with experimental results .",
    "along the same line , the work of @xcite successfully finds 11 states in the vector meson - vector meson interaction , five of which are identified as @xmath24 , @xmath26 , @xmath25 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , reported in the pdg and regarded as molecular states , and the other ones are predictions .",
    "an extension of this method to the case of the nonet of vectors interacting with the decuplet baryons is done in @xcite , dynamically generating some resonances found in pdg . turning to the vector nonet - baryon octet interactions , there are results obtained about @xmath29 particles in the work of @xcite .",
    "extension of these ideas to incorporate simultaneously pseudoscalar mesons , vector mesons and baryons is done in @xcite .",
    "the meson - meson interaction with charm is studied in @xcite , which dynamically generates the particles @xmath30 and @xmath31 . for the meson - baryon interaction , the works @xcite extrapolate the hidden gauge formalism with the coupled channel approach to the hidden charm sector , and dynamically generate some narrow @xmath0 and @xmath32 resonances around @xmath33 , not listed in the pdg .",
    "analogously , the work of @xcite extends this later formalism to the hidden beauty sector and also predicts several @xmath0 and @xmath32 states with narrow width and energies around @xmath34 .    on the other hand , in the heavy quark sectors",
    "there is another symmetry , heavy quark spin - flavour symmetry as stated in @xcite , or heavy quark spin symmetry ( hqss ) as described in @xcite , which predicts an @xmath35 bound state , suggested as the spin - doublet partner of the @xmath36 theoretically proposed as a @xmath37 bound state in @xcite . incorporating the hqss and the effective field theory , the charmed meson - antimeson system is investigated in @xcite , predicting six hidden charm states as hqss partners of the @xmath38 bound state , @xmath39 , two of which are assumed to be @xmath40 , a @xmath41 molecular state , and @xmath42 , a @xmath43 molecular state . under the su(8 )",
    "spin - flavour symmetry requirement , within the framework of the unitary coupled channel approach , the meson - baryon interactions are studied in @xcite , and some charmed and strange baryon resonances are produced dynamically in their theoretical models . a step forward in this direction is given in @xcite combining the local hidden gauge formalism and hqss , and using a the unitary coupled channel method , making a prediction of four hidden charm states with relatively small widths . in the present work , we extrapolate this later approach to the hidden beauty sector .",
    "we also propose a natural way to regularize the loops which removes ambiguities encountered in other works @xcite , and find 7 dynamically generated states with hidden beauty , with small widths , some of them degenerate in spin , which present a challenge for experimental investigation .",
    "following the work of @xcite , we extrapolate the formalism to the hidden beauty sector by just changing the @xmath44 meson to a @xmath45 meson and @xmath46-quark to @xmath47-quark",
    ". therefore we can study baryons with hidden beauty with isospin @xmath48 , and spin @xmath49 .",

    ", the @xmath102 and @xmath103 interaction can be shown using the feynman diagrams by exchanging a vector meson between the pseudoscalar or the vector meson and the baryon , as depicted in fig .",

    "note also that the possible exchange of @xmath106 is strongly suppressed because of the heavy @xmath107 mass .",
    "thus , one can see there one of the characteristics of the hqss symmetry where this interaction is also independent of the flavor of the heavy quarks , since there are just spectators .    using the local hidden gauge approach , one can evaluate the interaction potentials of su(4 ) , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] , which has this form @xmath108 where @xmath109 are the energies of the incoming and outgoing mesons ( for the vector mesons , we have ignored the factor @xmath110 , following the discussion in @xcite ) , and @xmath111 are coefficients given there .",
    "thus , combining these matrix elements with the hqss requirements , for the matrix elements of eq . in the @xmath112 sector",
    ", we obtain the values for the parameters of the low energy constants for @xmath112 , analogously to the ones in @xcite .",

    "but we keep it since this term is the only one that allows the scattering @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) through intermediate inelastic states .",
    "similarly , the matrix of eq . for @xmath12 , @xmath11 is given by @xmath121    because the coefficients @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath92 , @xmath93 are isospin dependent but @xmath122 independent , the results of eq .",

    "there are two methods to regularize it .",

    "the other method to regularize is using a cut - off momentum performing the integration @xmath136 where @xmath137 , and @xmath138 is the cut - off of the three - momentum , the free parameter .",
    "also the analytic formula of eq . can be seen in @xcite .    normally in the low energy ,",
    "the two regularization methods are compatible and there are relationships between these free parameters , @xmath133 , @xmath132 and @xmath138 ( seen eq .",
    "( 52 ) of @xcite ) . at higher energies ,",
    "as discussed in @xcite , there are large differences even not far away from threshold ( see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the cut - off method for the heavy hadrons has obvious deficiencies . indeed , with small excitation energies where the integrand is still large",
    ", the momentum is very large .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath4 channel , @xmath139 of energy correspond to @xmath140 momentum .",
    "if one takes a small cut - off of this size , as we go to excitation energies of about @xmath139 the @xmath127 function blows up since there is no cancellation of the two opposite sign parts of the integrand in the principal value of the integration ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : gqon ] ) .",
    "the physics of the problem should accommodate larger momentum than this . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of @xmath127 in dimensional regularization has its own problems , since matching it to the cut - off formula at threshold develops positive values below threshold , leading to the unphysical generation of states with a repulsive potential when @xmath141 .",
    "the cut - off method , however does not show this pathology since @xmath142 below threshold .",
    "it is clear that one must allow larger values of @xmath130 inside the integral , but on doing this , the factorization of the potential due to vector meson exchange can no longer be done as one usually does in the light sector .",
    "however , what might look like a technical inconvenience works on our favor since the @xmath143 dependence of the light vector meson propagator provides a physical regularization factor . recalling that @xmath144 is small for large values of @xmath145 in the heavy sector",
    ", one can take @xmath146 for lower momentum transfers one can take the approximation , @xmath147 , and then eq .",
    "becomes @xmath148 , which can be factorized outside the loop and give rise to the potential of eq . .",
    "in the heavy quark sector @xmath145 can be larger than @xmath149 and the @xmath145 dependence of eq . must be taken into account .",
    "we , thus , improve our formalism to solve this problem . as discussed in section vii of @xcite",
    ", we can introduce a form factor to the potential , @xmath150 then one show in @xcite that the @xmath151 matrix factorizes like eq .",
    "and one has @xmath152 and then the lippmann - schwinger equation becomes @xmath153^{-1}\\ , v , \\label{eq : bethe2}\\ ] ] but now @xmath154 once again we can put the integral equation as an algebraic equation @xcite .",
    "note that eq .",
    "has the same format as eq . , but , the matrices @xmath155 are defined by eqs . and , and the loop function @xmath156 is changed by eq . which absorbs a momentum dependent form factor from the factorized potential .",
    "then , the kernel @xmath157 is still the same as discussed in the last section [ sechqss ] .",
    "in present work , we focus on the beauty sector involving much higher energy than the light quark sector , even than the charm sector . as mentioned in the former section [ secicca ] , because of the large value of the momentum @xmath143 running in the loop , we should consider the @xmath143 dependence of the vector exchange .",
    "for this we use the formalism discussed in the former section .",
    "first , for the channels involving the light vector mesons exchange , such as @xmath4 channel , the problem is that the potential has a factor which does not depend on @xmath143 but just on @xmath158 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bsigb ] .",
    "however , we should keep in mind that while @xmath143 in the loop can be larger than @xmath149 , we only study states close to threshold where the external momenta are small .",
    "thus , we have @xmath159 which defines @xmath160 for the main potential related to the light vector meson exchange , this form factor should be incorporated into the new @xmath127 function , eq .",
    ", thus , there is a factor @xmath161 in the integral . with the implementation of the form factor in eq .",
    "the function @xmath127 becomes convergent . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gloop ] , we compare the new results for re@xmath162 and im@xmath162 with the new prescription with the sharp cut - off results with @xmath163 used in @xcite .",
    "as we can see , both re@xmath162 and im@xmath162 are reduced in the new approach which leads to smaller binding of the states .",
    "second , we still face another problem when we have the transitions coupling the channels @xmath164 , which involve the much heavier vector exchange , @xmath115 .",
    "this is analogous to be @xmath165 transition , which requires @xmath166 exchange in the charm sector .",
    "there are two cases in our coupled channel formalism , seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : etabn ]",
    ".    one can find diagrams like those on fig .",
    "[ fig : etabna ] involving @xmath119 amplitudes through the necessary intermediate states @xmath167",
    "( @xmath168 for @xmath169 or @xmath170 ) since the direct transition @xmath119 is null ( see eq .",
    "@xmath171 ) .",
    "obviously this amplitude will be very small since it involves the exchange of @xmath115 .",
    "we are not interested in this amplitude . the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : etabnb ] involves a term of the @xmath172 amplitude through @xmath1 intermediate state .",
    "this amplitude is also small , but it is the part that provides the width to the @xmath167 states since @xmath1 has smaller mass than @xmath167 .",
    "hence , we keep this diagram and since the @xmath173 transition is small we do not need to consider more than one @xmath1 loop when we evaluate the @xmath167 unitarized amplitude .",
    "hence , it is easy to implement this channel by also providing a form factor @xmath174 when we have an intermediate @xmath1 state .",
    "this form factor is also easy to implement as we discuss below .    to determine the new form factor , @xmath175",
    ", we should come back to the transition potential @xmath118 of eq .",
    ", which takes into account the heavy @xmath115 exchange propagator , @xmath176 if we calculate the four momentum @xmath177 by taking on shell approximation , we have @xmath178 where the on shell energies of the particles are given by @xmath179 once again , we take into account that in the loop one can exchange large momenta with small energy transfer .",
    "therefore , we can consider that the energy is the same but there will be an off shell momentum running .",
    "thus , we take @xmath180 where we have taken the external momentum @xmath181 as before and @xmath182 . hence , for the transition potential of eqs . and we shall use the on shell expression , eqs . and , as in the charm sector , but now in the @xmath1 channel we should use a form factor in the loop function , @xmath183 where the on shell energies , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , are given by eq . . in practice ,",
    "for @xmath185 we take average masses of @xmath47-baryons and then have a unique form factor @xmath175 .",
    "in our formalism we use the bethe - salpeter equation of eq . in coupled channels to evaluate the scattering amplitudes , where the @xmath127 function for the meson - baryon interaction is given by eq . .",
    "we firstly search the resonance peak in the scattering amplitudes and then look for poles in the second riemann sheet when there are open channels , or in the first riemann sheet when one has stable bound states ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "let @xmath186 be the complex energy where a pole appears .",
    "close to a pole the amplitude behaves as @xmath187 where @xmath188 is the coupling of the resonance to the @xmath189 channel .",
    "as one can see in eq .",
    ", @xmath190 is the residue of @xmath191 at the pole . for a diagonal transitions we have @xmath192 the determination of the couplings gives us an idea of the structure of the states found , since according to @xcite ,",
    "the couplings are related to the wave function at the origin for each channel .",
    "similarly to the charm sector , in all @xmath11 channels we have repulsive potentials as can be seen in eq .",
    "so , we should not expect any bound states or resonances .",
    "next we show the results for the @xmath193 sector in fig .",
    "[ fig : res11 ] .",
    "there are three clear peaks with non zero width between the range @xmath194 in the squared amplitudes of @xmath195 .",
    "these peaks are below the thresholds of @xmath196 respectively . from eqs . and",
    ", we know that the potentials of these channels are attractive , and the energy ranges where these peaks appear are reasonable . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gloop ] , one can see that the real parts of the loop function @xmath127 , eq .",
    ", are negative below the threshold . in the integration of @xmath197 .",
    "changes to @xmath198 or @xmath199 only lead to moderate changes on the binding of about @xmath200 , which we accept as systematic uncertainties of our approach . ]",

    "the experimental finding of some of the states predicted would allow us to be more refined on the regularization procedure , but for the time being we can accept the differences in the binding energies as uncertainties of our theoretical approach .",
    "we thus conclude that the states found would be bound by about @xmath275 and the widths are of the order of @xmath276 .",
    "in present work we investigate the hidden beauty sector by combining the dynamics of the local hidden gauge lagrangians extrapolated to su(4 ) with the constraints of heavy quark spin symmetry .",
    "we also benefit from the high energies of the problem and find a natural way to regularize the loops using the range provided by the light vector masses , whose exchange in the t - channel provide the source of the interaction in the local hidden gauge approach .    after our investigation",
    ", we find seven new states of @xmath0 with hidden beauty .",
    "all these states are different since they correspond to different energies or different total spin @xmath122 .",
    "yet , we found that some states are bound states of the same given meson - baryon channel and appear at about the same energy but different @xmath122 , which are analogous to those found in our former work on hidden charm .",
    "thus , they are degenerate states that we get in @xmath277 for @xmath6 and @xmath278 for @xmath7 . from this perspective , we report our results as claiming that we get four bound states with about @xmath275 binding and isospin @xmath10 , corresponding to @xmath4 with @xmath12 , @xmath8 with @xmath13 , @xmath6 degenerated with @xmath277 and @xmath7 degenerated with @xmath278 .",
    "note that the two states of @xmath279 with @xmath193 are consistent with the ones reported in @xcite .",
    "besides , we found no states in @xmath11 .",
    "we hope that the future experiments in the bes , belle , fair and other facilities will search for these states predicted here .",
    "we would like to thank j. nieves for much help and useful discussions .",
