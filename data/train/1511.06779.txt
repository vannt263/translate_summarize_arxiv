    "in 2007 the belle collaboration claimed the discovery of the z(4430 ) .",
    "this state attracted considerable attention because it is charged and couples to charmonium , implying that the most economical interpretation of its quark content is @xmath0 .",
    "the recent high statistics confirmation of the @xmath1 by the lhcb collaboration , and the startling demonstration of phase motion , has brought sharp focus on exotic hadronic matter .",
    "indeed , the @xmath2 joins a long list of other putative exotic states , several of which have been reported within the past year :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ @xmath3 multiquarks : :     +    x(3872 ) , z@xmath4(3900 ) , y(3940 ) , z@xmath4(4020 ) ,    z@xmath5(4050 ) , z@xmath6(4250 ) , y(4140 ) @xmath7 multiquarks : :     +    z@xmath8(10610 ) , z@xmath8(10650 ) other unusual states : :     +    d@xmath9(2317 ) , h dibaryon , y(2175 ) , y(4260 ) , y(4660 ) ,    y@xmath8(10888 ) , @xmath10 ,    @xmath11 , @xmath12 . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    although hadronic exotics such as glueballs , hybrids , and multiquark states have been long expected , the understanding of these states is primarily at the level of conjecture .",
    "certainly , if the confirmation of the @xmath2 marks the beginning of the exploration of a new sector of matter , the current phenomenology concerning quark interactions will need to be radically overhauled .",
    "a compelling and unified understanding of the new states has not yet emerged , and the gap between theory and experiment remains a major deficiency in our current level of understanding of elementary particle physics .",
    "this gap has its roots in the famously difficult problem of solving qcd in its many - body , strongly interacting , relativistic regime .",
    "current effective field theories are inoperable in the excited spectrum , lattice field theory has difficulties with weakly bound diffuse coupled - channel systems , and extant phenomenological models are insufficiently well constrained to be confidently applied to exotic states .",
    "even the lack of knowledge of relatively simple dynamics , such as interactions in the @xmath13 system , can affect the analysis of data concerning the new states .    the flood of information initiated by @xmath14 factories ( cleo , babar , belle ) , @xmath15-charm facilities ( cleo - c , besiii ) , and hadron machines ( cdf , d0 , lhcb , atlas , cms ) is not expected to abate soon .",
    "lhcb will continue to deliver new results in heavy quark spectroscopy for at least a decade . at the same time , besiii at the beijing electron positron collider will continue its program to collect and analyze @xmath16 data in the energy region of the putative exotic states of charmonium .",
    "furthermore , the gluex experiment is due to start taking data in 2015 .",
    "this experiment , situated at hall d at jlab , is designed to discover and explore the properties of light hybrid mesons .",
    "the compass experiment at cern has been , and will continue to be , very active in hadron spectroscopy .",
    "the panda experiment at fair is expected to start taking data in 2019 ; amongst its goals is the exploration of charmonium hybrids and other exotic states .    in view of this situation ,",
    "a workshop was convened at the institute of nuclear theory , seattle , with the aim of assessing the status of the field and drawing up a short list of questions that have the potential to move the field forward .",
    "this document is the outcome .",
    "we stress that this is not meant as a review , for which the reader is directed to refs .",
    "furthermore , the topics contained herein are not meant to be comprehensive , but are offered in the hope that progress will be spurred in various directions .",
    "the next three sections provide specific queries in the areas of lattice field theory , experiment , and theory .",
    "the lattice method has been singled out because it has advanced to the stage where modelling issues are minimal , but where results are sufficiently complex that experimental methods must sometimes be invoked to interpret them .",
    "finally , the interface between theory and experiment is addressed in section [ thy - int ] . here",
    "the emphasis is on smoothing the interaction between theorists and experimental collaborations with the hope of drawing on the strengths of both communities .",
    "1 .   * compute quantities as a function of light quark mass . * + a better determination of the contribution of ( virtual ) two heavy - light meson loops in @xmath17 states below threshold is needed .",
    "coupled channel phenomenological models suggest that for @xmath17 states near threshold these contributions are significant .",
    "after renormalization of the bare model parameters , one finds modest shifts in the leading nonrelativistic mass spectrum .",
    "spin splittings between ground state heavy - light mesons induce spin - dependent effects in the spectrum and allow hadronic transitions that violate the heavy quark spin symmetry expectations .",
    "furthermore , the mass splittings between the @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ground state heavy - light mesons allows small isospin breaking and considerable su(3 ) breaking effects .",
    "in particular , this may be evident in the large @xmath21 and @xmath22 transition rates . + in lattice qcd calculations , as the light quark masses",
    "are varied down from infinite ( quenched approximation ) to the scale of the momentum in the @xmath17 system the dominant effect of light quark loops is to modify the running of the qcd coupling ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "but as the quark masses are varied below this scale and below @xmath24 , light quark loops become spatially extended and probe the effects of coupled channels in the hadronic basis of states .",

    "+ we suggest that detailed lattice studies of the @xmath25 mass spectrum as a function of light quark masses ( @xmath26 ) for masses in a range between their physical values and @xmath27 will give much insight into the effects of coupling to decay channels in a model independent way . furthermore , a calculation of hadronic transition rates as a function of light quark masses would be very illuminating .",
    "2 .   * develop and implement coupled - channel scattering formalism .",
    "* + the recent publication @xcite of the first determinations of _ coupled - channel _ scattering amplitudes from lattice qcd offers promise that this first - principles approach to qcd might shed light on the exotic behavior being observed in charmonium . for the case of coupled two - body scattering , resonant singularities in the amplitudes can be explored using parameterizations of the @xmath28-matrix , where the parameters are tuned to describe the finite - volume spectra calculated in lattice qcd . from the pole positions and residues , masses , widths , and branching fractions of resonances",
    "can be determined  the distribution of poles across unphysical riemann sheets may offer a discriminator for the internal structure of the resonances .",
    "+ there has been no application of these coupled - channel techniques to meson systems featuring charm quarks , and only limited studies of elastic scattering , which is a situation in need of remedy .",
    "early targets will be charmed systems near threshold like @xmath29 and @xmath30 as well as exotic isospin and strangeness channels@xcite .",
    "double charmed channels like @xmath31 are also relatively simple .",
    "hidden charm channels are challenging , because while all the tools are in place to deal with the coupled @xmath32 system , the opening of three - body channels like @xmath33 and @xmath34 occurs at rather low energies .",
    "no complete formalism to relate finite - volume spectra to three - body scattering amplitudes yet exists ",
    "such a formalism will be required to study such systems in detail .",
    "+ calculations of meson - baryon scattering are at a less advanced stage than those for meson - meson scattering .",
    "current stochastic methods for dealing with quark propagation make the calculation of the @xmath35 scattering amplitudes straightforward with a modest increase in cost over meson - meson amplitudes , even for large volumes@xcite .",
    "3 .   * investigate static quark interactions .",
    "* + recent improvements to the set of techniques available for computing light quark propagation on the lattice should encourage practitioners to revisit the problem of computing potentials between static color sources and their excitation spectra @xcite . for related work see refs .",
    "these calculations have a long history and the static potential in the @xmath36 yang - mills theory was amongst the first lattice monte carlo computations . revisiting the potentials in the presence of light dynamical quarks @xcite will give useful insight into the nature of the @xmath37 and pentaquark experimental signals .",
    "in particular , the bottom quark sector could be modelled very effectively with this data while exotic mesons in the charm sector are more sensitive to finite mass corrections .",
    "phenomenological models of the exotic hadrons based on the born - oppenheimer picture would use these potentials as input .",
    "+ with a static color and anti - color source , separated along an axis at distance @xmath38 , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian are irreducible representations of the little group of symmetries that preserve this axis .",
    "the energy of these states as a function of distance defines the potential , @xmath39 .",
    "the residual symmetry means these potentials are labelled by @xmath40 , where there are two spin - zero potentials since a mirror symmetry is also a good symmetry for this case .",
    "the half - integer spin potentials do not appear in a theory of gluons alone but would be present in qcd . with two flavors of light quarks ,",
    "qcd energy eigenstates are classified with an extra quantum number , light isospin , and this property would be inherited by states built from static sources . there",
    "would thus be a new multiplicity of spectra with isospin @xmath41 .",
    "the isospin 0 and 1 spectra would be the relevant ones for studies of hidden charm or bottom tetraquarks and in particular , since the @xmath42 states are charged , the isospin 1 spectrum is of particular interest .",
    "this spectrum has not been computed in lattice qcd to date .",
    "+ for pentaquarks containing hidden charm @xmath43 or bottom @xmath44 the isospin @xmath45 and @xmath46 potentials are relevant for modelling these states .",
    "again , there is no counterpart for this potential in the theory of strongly - coupled gluons alone .",
    "another possible potential that might usefully be investigated and which has no counterpart in the pure gauge theory are those associated with two color sources , @xmath47 @xcite . in order to neutralize this color charge , at least one light quark field",
    "must be included in the creation operator .",
    "these potentials would help model doubly - charmed or doubly - bottom baryons .",
    "4 .   * compute form factors relevant to exotic states . * + the determination of the elastic and inelastic form factors of the @xmath37 resonances directly from lattice qcd would have three major impacts .",
    "first , it would lead to the theoretical reproduction of experimentally observed production or decay rates in a model - independent way .",
    "second , it will give access to poorly constrained quantities that would elucidate the nature and structure of these exotic states .",
    "examples of such quantities include the radii and electromagnetic moments of tentative molecular states .",
    "third , it will guide future experimental searches of exotics .",
    "although the studies of resonant electromagnetic processes are presently at their early stages , there have been a great deal of theoretical  @xcite and numerical  @xcite that demonstrate that they are in fact accessible from lattice qcd .",
    "this progress resulted in the first calculation of a radiative transition of a hadronic resonance  @xcite .",
    "this calculation was performed in the light sector for @xmath48 .",
    "+ having determined the @xmath48 amplitude for a range of values of the center of mass energy of the final @xmath49 state , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were able to analytically continue the amplitude onto the @xmath50-pole and determine the @xmath51 form factor .",
    "+ the same technology will be applicable for future calculations in the heavy quark sector .",
    "compute decay constants for exotic states . *",
    "+ the decay constants of the vector resonances determine their rate of production in @xmath52 and radiative transitions to lighter states offer a way to produce states of other @xmath53 .",
    "the rigorously correct way to determine these in lattice qcd is to first determine the scattering amplitudes and their resonant content as described above , and to then introduce an external vector current . by extrapolating the calculated vector - current matrix elements to the resonance poles , off in the complex energy plane , the decay constants and radiative transition rates for resonances can be obtained .",
    "this procedure closely resembles that for the determination of form factors discussed above .",
    "the techniques necessary for implementing this have been previously developed in refs .",
    "the first calculations of this type has been of @xmath49-electroproduction @xmath54  @xcite . + a slightly less rigorous approach , which may be acceptable for narrow resonances , is to ignore the hadronic decay of the states by excluding meson - meson - like operators from the basis used to determine the spectrum of states  a first round of calculations of this simplified type may be justified to aid our phenomenological intuition of the vector spectrum , extending the limited calculations presented in @xcite , using the excited state technology presented in @xcite .",
    "* in - medium hadron properties .",
    "* + several model calculations predict that charmonium - nucleus exotic bound states should exist  @xcite .",
    "two independent , equally important binding mechanisms have been identified : multigluon exchanges in the form of color van der waals forces  @xcite , and @xmath55 meson loop contributions to charmonium self - energy with medium - modified masses  @xcite . a first , recent lattice calculation  @xcite confirms model calculation expectations , finding relatively deeply bound states of @xmath56 and @xmath57 to several light nuclei .",
    "another interesting class of charmed - hadrons nuclear bound states are @xmath58-mesic nuclei  @xcite , which are an important source of information on chiral symmetry restoration in - medium  @xcite . a lattice calculation of the @xmath59meson interaction with nucleons and of @xmath59nuclei binding energies would be of great importance for constraining models , given the present lack of experimental information on the @xmath59nucleon interaction .",
    "1 .   * publish upper limits for negative searches . *",
    "+ candidates for exotic hadrons have been observed in many channels . while it is clearly important to find new decay channels for these states , it is also important to limit their decays to other channels when these searches are negative .",
    "this is a reminder to experimentalists to publish upper limits on cross sections and branching fractions in a wide range of channels .",
    "2 .   * confirm marginal states .",
    "* + a variety of signals have been observed that require confirmation .",
    "there is some urgency in achieving this because attempts to understand the data can be seriously misled by the acceptance of spurious signals as hadronic states . alternatively , many signals are statistically significant but contain unknown systematic errors due to assumptions in modelling ( for example using interfering breit - wigner amplitudes to obtain asymmetric line shapes ) .",
    "additional and more varied amplitude analysis is required in these cases . amongst states requiring confirmation",
    "are @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "3 .   * unravel the excited @xmath66 spectrum .",
    "* + the masses of the charmonium @xmath67 states are expected to be around 3.84.0  gev/@xmath68  @xcite , while @xmath69 and @xmath70 are well above the @xmath71 threshold but below @xmath72 threshold ; they are expected to be wide .",
    "if the mass of @xmath73 is high enough , @xmath74 will be its dominant decay mode .",
    "the @xmath70 may decay into @xmath75 as well .",
    "+ so far the @xmath76 observed in @xmath77  @xcite is regarded as the @xmath70 state , and the @xmath78 observed in @xmath79  @xcite is supposed to be a @xmath69 candidate , although its mass is a bit too close to @xmath70 , and it was not observed in @xmath77 .",
    "+ further study on @xmath80 decaying to @xmath71 and @xmath75 should be performed to identify @xmath69 and @xmath73 and to confirm the @xmath70 .",
    "+ with more data collected in @xmath16 annihilation at the @xmath81 and @xmath82 peaks , the e1 transitions @xmath83 and @xmath84 should be searched for ; e1 transitions of @xmath85 are also expected to be large compared with @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "+ hadronic transitions @xmath88 should be searched for , and the reaction @xmath89 may occur if the mass difference between @xmath80 and @xmath90 is large enough .",
    "the spin - parity of the @xmath69 candidate , @xmath78 , needs to be measured and its production and decay patterns should be examined carefully to see if it is the @xmath69 .",
    "* measure @xmath16 cross sections . *",
    "+ the region at center - of - mass energies above the open charm threshold is of great interest due the plethora of vector charmonium states : the @xmath91 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and @xmath92 observed in the inclusive hadronic cross section , and the vector charmonium - like states , the @xmath61 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 observed in exclusive hadronic modes .",
    "these states were discovered in one specific mode and are not observed in other modes .",
    "searches for these states in all possible final states are desired .",
    "this suggests high precision measurements of as many as possible exclusive @xmath16 annihilation modes , including multi - body open charm modes , hadronic transitions , radiative transitions , and even exclusive light hadron final states .",
    "[ xsections ] shows an example of measured cross sections of two - body open charm final states and two- or three - body hadronic transition modes .",
    "common features of the distributions are a richness of structures and a lack of precision . with more data from open charm threshold",
    "up to about 5  gev and improved precision , better theoretical models will likely be needed to describe the line shapes of all the final states simultaneously . in this way",
    "better knowledge on the excited @xmath97 and the @xmath98 states can be extracted .",
    "this may result in an understanding of the nature of these states and reveal if any are charmonium hybrids .",
    "+     + with the existing data samples , besiii can already improve precision of the open charm cross sections significantly  @xcite , considering the besiii experiment will continue run for another 6 - 8 years , better measurements at more energy points are expected .",
    "belle - ii  @xcite will start data taking in 2018 with a data sample expected to be fifty times larger than belle s .",
    "thus the precision of all the measurements with initial state radiation will be improved .",
    "+ the cross sections of @xmath16 annihilation into open bottom and bottomonium final states should also be measured to understand the excited bottomonium and bottomonium - like states .",
    "this can only be done at the belle - ii experiment  @xcite .",
    "* search for flavor analog exotic states . *",
    "+ the majority of recently discovered exotic states are placed firmly in the charmonium spectrum .",
    "flavor - independence of gluon exchange implies that flavor analog states should exist .",
    "for example , the @xmath99 and @xmath100 are evidently hidden bottom partners to the @xmath101 and @xmath102 multiquark candidate states .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath103 is the hidden strange partner of the @xmath93 .",
    "finding flavor - analog states will yield valuable information on the dynamics underlying the new states and will probe the robustness of putative models .",
    "+ the case of a bottomonium analog of the @xmath104 is interesting , both because of the novelty of the @xmath105 and because of differences that may arise .",
    "for example , if the @xmath105 is a weakly bound @xmath106 system then the @xmath107 would be expected at mass of 10604 mev . however , some models @xcite rely on the proximity of the hidden charm @xmath108 and @xmath109 channels to stabilize the @xmath105 .",
    "this coincidence is _ not _ repeated in the case of the @xmath107 , where the @xmath110 threshold lies 370 mev away .",
    "this also implies that the novel isospin - breaking features of the @xmath105 will not be repeated in the @xmath107 ( isospin symmetry breaking is related to the hidden flavor mixing and to the splitting between charged and neutral @xmath106 channels  neither of which is repeated in the case of the @xmath107 ) .",

    "minimally this shows that qcd - like gauge theories are not excluded from having tetraquark states even if the quarks are light .",
    "the following are a few suggestions that could help facilitate collaboration between theory and experiment .    1 .",
    "* improve parameterizations of the data . *",
    "+ one of the challenges in many of the experimental studies of the @xmath37 states is to develop correct parameterizations of the data .",
    "for example , amplitude analyses often find a need to introduce non - resonant terms . at present ,",
    "very little theoretical guidance is provided except for the amplitude formulations based on the k - matrix approach . however , the latter is not always practical .",
    "+ to improve this situation , we have two recommendations .",
    "+ first , we encourage that , when appropriate and beneficial , experimentalists and theorists directly work together on the analysis of data .",
    "this could be accommodated by theorists becoming co - authors on specific experimental papers they substantially contributed to , or joint submission of experimental and theoretical papers cross - referencing each other .",
    "the experiments are encouraged to formalize procedures making such collaboration possible , and theorists are encouraged to approach the experiments when they think they might directly aid specific data analysis topics .",
    "further progress could be made by more persistent forms of collaboration , including direct involvement of theorists in the data analysis process within the established procedures of the experimental collaborations .",
    "+ second , we encourage theorists , when possible , to publish complete functional forms ( amplitudes , etc . ) that could be used in the fitting of data .",
    "one example of this is in the parameterization of rescattering amplitudes .",
    "the current theoretical calculations are dependent only on the center of mass energy  @xcite , whereas amplitudes used in fitting require a flexible parameterization involving the angular information of the decay .",
    "if theorists develop more complete rescattering amplitudes , experimentalists could use them in analyses .",
    "this would most likely involve some collaborative effort in understanding both how the experimental analysis is performed and what are the theoretical requirements for such amplitudes .",
    "another example is in resonance parameterizations : it would be useful for experimentalists if a number of alternate resonance parameterizations were available that could be used in systematic studies .",
    "+     2 .   *",
    "make experimental results more accessible for subsequent interpretation . *",
    "+ the analysis of data from many modern experiments often necessitates complying with internal rules designed to provide collaborative controls over the quality of statistical methods used and the proper evaluation of systematic uncertainties .",
    "therefore it is unrealistic to expect that all data will be made available for analyses outside of this collaborative setting .",
    "a correct analysis of data would benefit from the types of closer interaction between experiment and theory discussed in the previous point . +",
    "a different issue is how published data ( for example , dalitz plots ) should be subsequently interpreted .",
    "it often occurs that experimental results are made public in a manner that does not easily allow for subsequent interpretation .",
    "+ one example is the discovery of the @xmath101 decaying to @xmath170 in the process @xmath207  @xcite .",
    "the data presented in the discovery papers include several effects that are difficult to take into account when performing theoretical fits .",
    "first , the besiii data  @xcite was taken at @xmath208  gev , while the belle data  @xcite includes a range of energies around the @xmath93 peak .",
    "this makes the belle data , in particular , hard to subsequently fit , since any changes ( beyond the size of available phase space ) in the @xmath170 mass spectrum as a function of @xmath209 mass are unknown .",
    "second , the two experiments have different experimental efficiencies over the dalitz plot due to differing detectors and kinematics .",
    "these effects are not quantified in the publications .",
    "the importance of these two effects can be seen when comparing the @xmath210 plots from besiii and belle , which differ substantially , especially in the low - mass region  ( fig .",
    "[ zcshapes ] ) .",
    "it is therefore not clear how one could correctly analyze the published data with various new parameterizations to test , for example , differences between cusp and resonant models of the @xmath101 .",
    "+ when deemed appropriate , experiments are therefore encouraged to make efficiency - corrected data available for external analyses . or , when possible or desired , experiments could make published plots publicly available along with efficiency curves and instructions for how to use the plots for subsequent analysis .",
    "this could be provided as supplemental information to a publication .",
    "this may be easy for simple three - body final states ( like @xmath211 , where the dalitz plot could be provided ) , but impractical for more complicated final states .",
    "+ another suggestion , especially when amplitude analyses have been performed , is to publish a complete parameterization of the data , including both the formulas and the numerical values for each fit parameter .",
    "+ making data public in these ways could help facilitate ongoing efforts to test and build models .",
    "it could also permit combined fits of data from different experiments or different channels , thus helping a more global picture to emerge .",
    "* preview upcoming analysis results .",
    "* + it may be useful , in some circumstances , for experimental collaborations to provide a list of upcoming experimental results .",
    "this might be a fruitful way to elicit new theoretical predictions or ideas .",
    "for example , if the community knows a certain measurement is being performed , there is then a chance to make predictions prior to the publication of experimental results .",
    "it also permits setting priorities in theoretical computations and enhances the possibility of arranging collaborative effort . hosting such a list on a common platform may prove useful and should be explored .",
    "4 .   * create a list of publications in @xmath37 physics . *",
