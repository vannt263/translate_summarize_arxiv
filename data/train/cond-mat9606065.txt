    "phase - sensitive measurements involving josephson junctions has recently become an important technique for probing the pairing symmetry of high-@xmath0 superconductors  @xcite .",
    "several experiments point to the existence of @xmath1 junctions between high-@xmath0 superconductors  @xcite , strongly suggesting d - wave symmetry , though other possibilities can not be ruled out completely . in this paper",
    "we present a simple expression ( valid for junctions with arbitrary pairing symmetry ) , that shows how a particular feature in the density of states contributes to the critical current in a josephson junction .",
    "for example , it is now well - known  @xcite that , for certain orientations , d - wave superconductors exhibit a midgap peak in the surface density of states . using our formulation ,",
    "one can easily see with a ` back of the envelope ' calculation that this midgap peak will lead to a large contribution to the critical current that will decay inversely with temperature .",
    "we write the current i between the two superconductors 1 and 2 in terms of the phase difference @xmath2 as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is given by ( f(e ) : fermi function ) : @xmath5_{(e+i\\eta ) } \\label{eq : current}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this paper we will only discuss the tunneling limit in which @xmath4 is independent of @xmath2 and the pair correlation functions @xmath6 can be approximated by their values at a free surface  @xcite .",
    "these functions are obtained by evaluating the retarded green function for the bogoliubov - degennes equation .",
    "complicated band - structures and pairing symmetries can be accounted for by an appropriate choice of the one - particle hamiltonian h and pair potential @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8    the surface green function g appearing in eq  [ eq : current ] is obtained from the full green function @xmath9 by setting @xmath10 , @xmath11 being the normal to the surface : @xmath12 in eq  [ eq : current ] , we have assumed a one - dimensional model for which @xmath13 as well as the coupling element m are purely numbers . a generalized version of this equation is presented at the end of this paper that can be used when @xmath13 and m are matrices . for our discussions in this paper",
    "the simple version in eq  [ eq : current ] is adequate since we will only consider planar junctions with s - wave or d - wave order parameters , for which each transverse wave vector @xmath14 decouples into an independent one - dimensional channel .",
    "the generalized version is needed to handle disordered junctions , multiple atomic orbitals and complicated multilayer order parameters  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this formulation is that it allows us to predict the josephson current from a knowledge of the pair correlation functions for the individual isolated superconductors . from this point of view",
    "eq  [ eq : current ] is similar to the well - known formula for the conductance ( @xmath15 ) @xmath16 that is routinely used to obtain the density of states ( @xmath17 ) from experimental data .",
    "indeed , the pair correlation functions @xmath18 exhibit features similar to those in the density of states and can often be guessed intuitively as discussed in section  [ discuss ] .",
    "we will not go into the derivation of eq  [ eq : current ] which follows from the green function formalism  @xcite .",
    "however it can be seen easily that for ordinary s - wave superconductors it yields the standard results . to establish contact with the literature , we rewrite eq  [ eq : current ] as a sum over the matsubara energies @xmath19 along the imaginary axis : @xmath20 _ { ( e = i\\omega_n ) }                         \\label{eq : matsubara}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] making use of the property @xmath21 ( which is true provided @xmath22 ) , eq  [ eq : matsubara ] reduces to @xmath23 this result is often applied to s - wave junctions using the bulk pair correlation function for f and",
    "can be combined with eq  [ eq : resistance ] to obtain the ambegaokar - baratoff relation  @xcite . in",
    "d - wave ( and some other unconventional ) superconductors , the surface pair - correlation functions can show features like ` midgap peaks ' that are absent in the bulk .",
    "the point to note is that eq  [ eq : current ] ( or [ eq : matsubara ] ) can be used for arbitrary pairing symmetry , _ provided we use the correct pair - correlation functions at the surface rather than the ones in the bulk_. eqs  [ eq : current ] and [ eq : matsubara ] are equivalent and it is largely a matter of taste which one we use . in this paper",
    ", we will use the former and present our results in terms of the pair correlation functions and the current spectrum along the real energy axis .",
    "to use eq  [ eq : current ] we need the pair correlation functions @xmath24 . in general",
    "it is fairly straightforward to obtain a numerical solution for complicated band - structure and pairing symmetries  @xcite .",
    "but even without a detailed quantitative solution , one may be able to guess @xmath25 from a knowledge of the density of states and use it to gain insight into the resulting effect on the josephson current .",
    "for example , for d - wave superconductors with small values of the misorientation angle @xmath26 and transverse wave - vector ( @xmath27 ) , @xmath24 has the usual form encountered with s - wave superconductors  @xcite : @xmath28 the current spectrum @xmath29 is s - wave like and the critical current has the usual temperature dependence .",
    "but when the quantity @xmath30 is large , @xmath24 is dominated by a singularity at e=0 corresponding to the midgap peak in the density of states .",
    "@xmath31 this results in a large contribution to the critical current which , however , decays rapidly with temperature . to see this",
    ", we use eq  [ eq : approx ] in eq  [ eq : current ] to obtain @xmath32 where @xmath33 represents the derivative of the delta function . hence from eq",
    "[ eq : current ] @xmath34 indicating that the contribution of the midgap peak to the critical current decays with temperature as  @xmath35 .",
    "the apparent divergence near t=0 can be eliminated either by including a finite @xmath36 to represent phase - breaking effects or by going beyond the weak - coupling approximation ( @xmath37 )  @xcite .",
    "the recent results of ref   for d - wave junctions ( which includes strong coupling effects ) also indicate a similar anomalous temperature dependence of the midgap contribution to the critical current .",
    "for quantitative calculations , we evaluate the pair - correlation functions from the bdg equation using a two - dimensional tight - binding lattice with a dispersion relation of the form(@xmath38 , @xmath39 ) : @xmath40 and a pair potential of the form : @xmath41 we set @xmath42 which corresponds to a phase - relaxation time of @xmath43 ps , if @xmath44 is 20 mev .",
    "fig 2 shows the bulk and surface correlation function for @xmath45 and 30 degrees with @xmath46 . if either @xmath26 or @xmath47 is zero , the midgap term ( see eq  [ eq : approx ] ) is absent and the surface @xmath24 looks similar to the bulk @xmath24 . but with both @xmath26 and @xmath47 non - zero , the surface and bulk functions are completely dissimilar .",
    "the bulk pair correlation function exhibits two gaps corresponding to @xmath48 and @xmath49 respectively , since they experience different values of @xmath50 .",
    "the surface pair correlation function involves a non - trivial mixture of the two and has a midgap peak as evident from the second of fig  [ fig : corr]b .",
    "fig 3a shows the current spectrum for a josephson spectrum with @xmath51 degrees . with @xmath52 , the spectrum is s - wave - like with peaks close to @xmath53 .",
    "but with @xmath54 we have a large midgap contribution . on integrating over @xmath55  @xcite , this midgap contribution completely dominates the usual peak away from midgap , ( see fig  [ fig : c]b ) .",
    "the midgap peak has the form of a doublet function ( @xmath33 ) and its contribution to @xmath4 will disappear with increasing temperature as discussed earlier .",
    "fig  [ fig : sigrist]a and b show the critical current as a function of the misalignment angles @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 and with @xmath59 respectively .",
    "for comparison we have also shown the results from the phenomenological relation given by sigrist and rice  @xcite ( fig  [ fig : sigrist]c ) : @xmath60 we note that in fig  [ fig : sigrist]a , the current has peaks at @xmath61 due to the large midgap peaks in @xmath24 , in sharp disagreement with eq  [ eq : sigrist ]  @xcite . at higher temperatures ( fig  [ fig : sigrist]b ) the contribution of these peaks is reduced as explained earlier , and the variation in the critical current looks closer to what we expect from eq  [ eq : sigrist ] .",
    "a full calculation of @xmath62 requires a self - consistent evaluation of the pair potential  @xcite , which we do not address in this paper . using the self - consistent pair potential from ref  , we find that the current contribution due to the midgap peak is suppressed somewhat , but its effect should still be observable .",
    "finally we note that eq  [ eq : current ] can be generalized to include cases where the pair correlation functions as well as the matrix element m are matrices instead of pure numbers . the current spectrum",
    "is then given by    @xmath63_{(e+i\\eta ) } \\label{eq : j}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    instead of eq  [ eq : current ] .",
    "we believe eq  [ eq : j ] should be useful in calculating the josephson current taking into account disordered junctions , multiple atomic orbitals , or complicated pair potentials .",
    "the required surface green functions can be calculated numerically using an iterative scheme once the appropriate tight - binding hamiltonian has been identified  @xcite .",
