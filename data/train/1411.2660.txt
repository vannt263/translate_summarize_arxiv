    "the morphological and chemical evolutions of galaxies are dominated by interstellar medium ( ism ) through star formation activity . while the ism works as a fuel on a birth of stars , heavy elements which were made in stars spread out into interstellar space through supernovae and agb stars which are the end phase of stars .",
    "the supernovae may trigger star formation compressing the surrounding ism .",
    "repetition of the birth and death of stars changes the galaxy - scale environments .",
    "it is known that the early type spiral galaxies have high molecular - to - atomic gas ratio @xcite .",
    "molecular gas fraction , which is practically the same with molecular - to - atomic gas ratio also varies even within a galaxy @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed radial distributions of molecular gas fraction of nearby spiral galaxies can be explained by a theoretical model fitting using the combinations of observational data .",
    "this result shows that local environment determines molecular gas fraction . in a galaxy cluster , h is deficient @xcite , while co gas is not deficient @xcite .",
    "these studies show that ram pressure effectively and selectively remove h , which typically resides outer region than molecular gas , from a galaxy into inter galactic space . the properties of ism are highly connected to the environments of galaxies locally and globally .",
    "a galaxy interaction is one of the biggest events for galaxies .",
    "dynamical and morphological changes on not only stars but also ism are occurred by the collision of galaxies .",
    "it is also confirmed that interacting galaxies show active star formation activity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of ( ultra ) luminous infrared galaxies ( u / lirgs ) which are the active star forming galaxies are merging galaxies ( late stage of interaction)(e.g . , @xcite ) .",
    "taking into account for these facts , properties of ism in interacting galaxies should be affected during the interaction .",
    "it is said that molecular gas mass is enhanced by the interaction @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed a ratio of molecular gas to atomic gas is higher in interacting galaxies than that in isolated galaxies in a galaxy scale .",
    "these results , however , are derived from the observations aiming at the centre of galaxies , which may underestimate molecular gas mass and have no information on molecular gas distribution .",
    "what is more , most investigated interacting galaxies are in late stage of interaction because they show highly enhanced star formation activity .",
    "although properties of ism of interacting galaxies in early and mid stage are important because the conditions of active star formation should be fulfilled before the starburst , these properties are not investigated .",
    "this is because weaker star formation activity than interacting galaxies in late stage ( e.g. , u / lirgs ) implies weaker emission from molecular gas .",
    "understanding properties of ism in early and mid stage of interaction will discover the origin of the burst of star formation in late stage of interaction like u / lirgs .",
    "@xcite ( paper i henceforth ) showed @xmath0co(_j _",
    "=  10 ) ( hereafter , co ) mapping data of four interacting galaxies in early and mid stage of the interaction .",
    "these mapping data are suitable for investigations of properties of ism under the effect of the interaction . in this paper",
    ", we performed the investigation of properties of ism in interacting galaxies in early and mid stage of interaction in the context of gas content and molecular gas fraction .",
    "molecular gas fraction is examined both the galaxy scale and kpc scale which can resolve galactic structures .",
    "star formation activity in interacting galaxies in early and mid stage of the interaction based on the results of this paper will be discussed in forthcoming paper .",
    "in order to investigate properties of ism in interacting galaxies , we need data which cover the whole system of the interacting galaxies and resolve the galactic structures . here , we use data set of tracers of diffuse molecular gas ( co ) , atomic gas ( h ) , old stars ( _ k@xmath8 _ ) and star formation ( h@xmath9 , fuv , 8 @xmath10 m and 24 @xmath10 m ) . for comparison , we also use the data set of co and h for isolated galaxies .      for the sample of interacting galaxies",
    ", we used the co data obtained with the 45-m telescope at the nobeyama radio observatory of four interacting galaxies , arp84 , vv219 , vv254 and the antennae galaxies from paper i. details are summarized in paper i.    for comparison , the control sample of isolated spiral galaxies was obtained from nobeyama co atlas @xcite .",
    "this atlas is the co mapping survey of 40 nearby spiral galaxies using the nro 45-m telescope .",
    "since the atlas covers almost whole region of the sample galaxies with the same angular resolution as our observations ( 16@xmath11 at 115.27 ghz , which is the rest frequency of the co line ) , the atlas data can be used for a direct comparison with our data of interacting galaxies . to remove the environmental effects",
    ", we excluded galaxies which belong to the virgo and coma clusters from the control sample .",
    "the average of the distance of interacting galaxies is 38 mpc , which is larger than that of any isolated galaxies in @xcite and our interacting galaxies sample have a lower sensitivity of co integrated intensity in average than galaxies in @xcite about a factor of 2 . in order to have same co sensitivity between interacting galaxies and isolated galaxies",
    ", we also remove isolated galaxies with the distance nearer than 7 mpc .",
    "we used the h data obtained with ovro by @xcite , except for the antennae galaxies whose data was taken from @xcite .    for six isolated galaxies ,",
    "the h data were taken from things .",
    "we also gathered the h data from literature for isolated galaxies which surveyed by the co atlas but were not observed by things .",

    "next , in order to investigate how many parameter sets are successfully reproduced the odd relationship in ngc  5395 , we quantify the monotonic decrease of @xmath28 along the surface density of total gas .",
    "since the range of the surface density of total gas of ngc  5395 is about from 5 @xmath6 pc@xmath7 to 25 @xmath6 pc@xmath7 , we divided data points into three parts : the data with @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",

    "this result confirms our model can reproduce the odd trends in ngc  5395 in a wide parameter space and no parameter set can reproduce if external pressure term is not included .",
    "the fact that the external pressure is needed to reproduce the observational trend can be qualitatively understood as follows . in the case of constant sfr ( see , figure [ fmolmetallicity ] ) , @xmath28 increases gradually along the increase of the surface density of total gas . in reality , sfr is not constant throughout a galaxy .",
    "when sfr in ngc  5395 becomes high along with the increase of the surface density of total gas as is often the case with normal spiral galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xmath28 at high surface density of total gas should get lower than that in the case of constant sfr .",
    "additionally , the increase of external pressure affects to increase @xmath28 selectively where the surface density of total gas is low ( figure [ fmolexpressure ] ) . due to the combination of these effects ,",
    "ngc  5395 has an odd trend of the decrease of @xmath28 with the increase of the surface density .",
    "this result also suggests that the trend of decreasing with the surface density of total gas in ngc  5395 is not due to the uncertainty of the inclination of molecular gas and atomic gas discs , and there is an influence of the external pressure .",
    "the @xmath38 map ( figure [ ngc5395fmolfit ] bottom ) suggests possible parameters locate very narrow range .",
    "metallicity equals to or higher than the solar metallicity and weak external pressure are necessary to explain the odd tendency of ngc  5395 .",
    "plausible parameter space of ngc  4567 and ngc  4568 shows external pressure is higher than 5.0 , corresponding to 40.0 @xmath6 pc@xmath7 ( 5.0@xmath51)(figure [ ngc4567fmolfit ] and [ ngc4568fmolfit ] ) . although ngc  4567 and ngc  4568 pair has most undisturbed morphology in our sample , the fitting results demand strong external pressure .",
    "close encounter may cause strong external pressure even in early stage of interaction .    on contrary to ngc  5395 , ngc  4567 and ngc  4568 , rest 2 pair ( vv  254 and the antennae galaxies ) and ngc  5394 can not restrict the parameter space .",
    "therefore , it is not clear whether these galaxies are affected by external pressure .",
    "there are several reasons to explain the model fitting in failure .",
    "since ngc  5394 and the antennae galaxies show active star formation throughout the region where co and h is detected ( see , h@xmath9 , fuv , 24 @xmath10 m and 8 @xmath10 m images in paper i ) even in early or mid stage of interaction , these galaxies experience strong uv photo dissociation .",
    "nevertheless high @xmath28 value nearly 1.0 ( fully molecules ) is achieved . according to our model ,",
    "it is hard to distinguish the cause of high @xmath28 at low surface density of total gas from high metallicity and high external pressure .",
    "therefore , model fitting can not constrain these parameters in these galaxies .",
    "another explanations can be done for vv  254 .",
    "elmegreen s model assumes that h ",
    "h@xmath1 production and destruction rate is under equilibrium .",
    "vv  254 undertakes first encounter just 2@xmath1910@xmath52 years ago @xcite .",
    "gravitational disturbance changes the environment of galaxies .",
    "although it is enough to produce molecular gas from interstellar gas ( this issue will be discussed in section [ mechanismfmol ] ) , it may not reach the balanced state of h  h@xmath1 production and destruction rate .",
    "thus , the facts that it is observed large @xmath28 dispersion at same surface density of total gas and unsuccess of model fitting could be reasonable for vv  254 .",
    "second possibility is the uncertainty of sfr . according to @xcite , uv emission , which we used to derive sfr for this pair , traces star formation over time scales of 10@xmath53 years or longer .",
    "therefore , sfr derived from uv traces star formation not only occurred after the collision but also before the collision .",
    "thus sfr that we used for the fitting should not trace recent uv radiation .",
    "moreover , recent pa@xmath9 observations imply that star formation in vv  254 is more active than our estimation @xcite .",
    "the fitting results for ugc  12915 ( figure [ ugc12915fmolfit ] ) showed that calculated @xmath28 tends to have higher value than observationally derived @xmath28 .",
    "this could be due to underestimate of sfr through fuv emission .",

    "thus , there is a possibility that we overestimate molecular gas mass and @xmath28 for interacting galaxies . if we assume that the conversion factor is a factor of 2 lower than the conventional value we adopted in this discussion , that is , @xmath54 = 9.0 @xmath19 10@xmath57 cm@xmath7 ( k km s@xmath14)@xmath14 , we find that the average of @xmath28 is 0.62 @xmath3 0.17 and the median is 0.59 . as long as assuming a factor of 2 lower @xmath54 , @xmath28 in interacting galaxies are still higher than that in the control sample galaxies",
    ".    then we performed the theoretical fitting on @xmath28@xmath58 relation again in the case of adopting @xmath54 of 9.0 @xmath19 10@xmath57 cm@xmath7 ( k km s@xmath14)@xmath14 .",
    "the fitting results show that a factor of 2 lower @xmath54 yields at least 2 times worth the minimum @xmath38 than the standard @xmath54 factor for all interacting galaxies ( table [ fit ] ) .",
    "the lvg analyses @xcite show that vv  254 and the antennae galaxies have lower @xmath54 than the galactic one .",
    "according to our fittings , however , it may as well to adopt that the the galactic @xmath55 to @xmath56 conversion factor in interacting galaxies in early stage . however , since the conversion factor in interacting galaxies is still under discussion , more researches are needed to confirm our assumption .",
    "we discuss possible mechanisms of the enhancement of @xmath28 seen in interacting galaxies even in the early stage in the terms of shock - induced molecular gas formation .",
    "one possible scenario is that wide - spread shock in the galaxies compresses the interstellar gas . in order to understand wide - spread star formation throughout interacting galaxies as seen in the antennae galaxies which can not be explained by gas concentration models ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xcite made star formation model in which star formation takes place where the rate of shock - induced mechanical heating changes largely .",
    "his model successfully explained the wide - spread star formation seen in the mice galaxy ( ngc  4676 ) which is in the early stage of the interaction .",
    "additionally , @xcite shows by numerical hydrodynamic calculations that shocks occur in a disc of gas in a gravitationally perturbed galaxy at the early stage of the interaction even in a distant encounter like fly - by interactions . in icke s simulations ,",
    "strong shock emerges even in the minor merger whose mass ratio of 4 . in the result , it can be thought that high pressure is brought to the galaxy .",
    "this pressure induced by the interaction with the counterpart galaxy should enhance the conversion rate from h to h@xmath1 and high @xmath28 is achieved even in low surface density of total gas .",
    "another scenario is a cloud - cloud collision model which should suit for the contact region of vv  219 and the overlap region of vv  254 .",
    "this cloud - cloud collision model has two cases on molecular gas formation .",
    "a difference between two cases is behaviors of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) during the galaxy - galaxy collision .",
    "@xcite investigate the behaviors of interstellar clouds during a galaxy interaction and show that only h clouds can collide each other and gmcs can not collide because volume filling factor is smaller than h clouds .",
    "the collision between h clouds causes strong shock and clouds fully ionized .",
    "since such an ionized gas compresses the surface of un - collided gmcs with their high pressure and gmcs become unstable , they attribute effective star formation in interacting galaxies to this mechanism .",
    "although they do not consider the reaction between high pressure and pre - collision h clouds , this leads to the production of molecular gas from the h clouds .    on the other hand , @xcite considered the possibility of gmc - gmc collisions and concluded that not only h clouds but gmcs can also collide because the volume filling factor which @xcite assumed is too small .",
    "when gmc - gmc collisions happen , gmcs are destroyed and ionized with shock as h clouds rather than encouraged to form stars and then @xmath28 decreases .",
    "hot ionized gas with temperature of @xmath59 10@xmath60 k , however , becomes rapidly below 10@xmath61 k through emission line @xcite .",
    "the cooling time scale is only a few years and much shorter than the collision time scale .",
    "therefore , ionized gas , whether originally atomic or molecular gas , becomes cool and neutral soon .",
    "if the reproduced h gas is dense enough , h becomes h@xmath1 .",
    "h@xmath1 formation time scale is the longest time scale in these processes and governed by the inverse of the density .",
    "the density in the collision front including the overlap region may be higher than the disc region of the progenitors because that region is produced in the result of the collision of two galaxies .",
    "thus , the efficient production of molecular gas procedure runs there no matter which originally h or h@xmath1 gas .",
    "however , in the case of gmc - gmc collisions , a production time scale of co which we observed and used as an h@xmath1 tracer may differ that of h@xmath1 . here , we discuss the time scale of molecular gas production based on the chemical processes under the condition that molecular gas is destroyed by a gmc - gmc collision . in this case , since both h@xmath1 and co gas are destroyed , we must consider time scales of the production of h@xmath1 and co gas . if time scale of the formation of co greatly differs from that of h@xmath1 , the co - h@xmath1 conversion factor is changed and it leads to error of real @xmath28 .",
    "although there are many ways to convert from c to co , the transition which we must pay attention to is the dominant transition on the production of co. thus we treat one of the most contributive routes on the production of co gas which occurs via ch@xmath62 .",
    "this process progresses at photo - dissociation region and ch@xmath62 is made from h@xmath1 and c@xmath63 . according to this process , the time scale of the formation of co gas is @xmath5 10@xmath64 years , where @xmath65 is a number density of hydrogen in the unit of @xmath66 @xcite , while the time scale of the formation of h@xmath1 gas is @xmath5 10@xmath67 years .",
    "thus in typical molecular cloud whose density is @xmath510@xmath68 @xmath66 , these time scales correspond @xmath510@xmath60 years and @xmath510@xmath52 years for co and h@xmath1 gas , respectively . to say",
    "simply , co gas can be made only after the production of h@xmath1 gas .",
    "additionally , the order of time scales to form co and h@xmath1 take both about 10@xmath52 years .",
    "therefore , we do not underestimate the co - h@xmath1 conversion factor at least in later than 10@xmath52 years after the collision . even for vv  254 which is just after the collision ,",
    "time scale for the production of co and h@xmath1 of 10@xmath52 years is comparable to the collision age .",
    "this fact reinforces that high @xmath28 in the interacting galaxies is not misunderstanding due to the difference of the co - h@xmath1 conversion factor but real tendency .",
    "moreover , a shock induced by the collision is capable of shortening the time scale of the formation of molecular gas .",
    "@xcite discussed the time scale to form h@xmath1 gas under strong shock to explain warm h@xmath1 rotation line emission found in the collision front of ongoing interacting galaxies , the stephan s quintet . according to them ,",
    "the time scale of the production of h@xmath1 from hot plasma is roughly the inverse of the gas density with temperature of 10@xmath61 k and is formulated as follows : @xmath69 } \\simeq 7 \\times 10^{5 } f_{\\mathrm{dust}}\\left(\\frac{2 \\times 10^{5 } \\mathrm{[k \\ cm^{-3}]}}{p_{\\mathrm{th}}}\\right)^{0.95},\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the thermal gas pressure and @xmath71 the dust mass fraction remaining in the gas .",
    "they showed that warm h@xmath1 gas is formed in the collision front of the stephan s quintet even at its age after the collision of 5 @xmath19 10@xmath72 years .",
    "furthermore , time scales for the formation of co and cold h@xmath1 takes only @xmath5 10@xmath72 years after temperature of the postshock gas becomes below 10@xmath61 k ( see , @xcite fig.c.2 ) . taking into account for this fact , it is not surprising that plenty cold h@xmath1 gas and co gas are made in interacting galaxies with the age of the interaction much longer than the stephan s quintet . in our observational results , the overlap region of vv  254 would be the case that can be explained with this idea .",
    "although strong shock should be prevailed on there because vv  254 collides the head - on collision , molecular gas can be formed from ionized gas in a short time which is also briefly mentioned in @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath28 should vary with location because the time scale of the formation of molecular gas is depend upon a pre - shock gas density and time after the collision also differs according to the location .",
    "thus , the dispersion of @xmath28 at the same surface density of total gas is expected to become large in interacting galaxies under the existence of the shock . from the view of chemical time scale",
    ", it is not ruled out that high @xmath28 seen in interacting galaxies is achieved by the shock induced by the interaction .",
    "therefore , even if gmc - gmc collisions happen , @xmath28 may increase and when the density is high enough high @xmath28 is seen even in the early stage of the interaction .",
    "we have discussed the reason why external pressure in interacting galaxies in early stage increases .",
    "two scenarios , wide - spread shock and cloud - cloud collisions ( both h - h cloud collisions and gmc - gmc collisions ) , are plausible causes of external pressure .",
    "former one explains galactic scale external pressure , while latter one especially suits for the collision front of the interaction . in both case , shock undertakes an important role on effective gas phase transition from h to h@xmath1 .",
    "we investigated the ism properties in interacting galaxies in early and mid stage of the interaction using co and h mapping data .",
    "our findings are as follows : +   + 1",
    ". slight decrease of total gas mass with large dispersion is found in interacting galaxies .",
    "h mass is smaller in interacting galaxies compared with the control sample .",
    "molecular gas fraction in interacting galaxies is significantly higher than that in field galaxies .",
    "pixel - to - pixel comparison showed that high molecular gas fraction is achieved where the surface density of total gas is low .",
    "+ 5 . with numerical model fittings , ngc  4567 ,",
    "ngc  4568 and ngc  5395 are successfully explained the observation , which may be occurred by external pressure .",
    "+ 6 . adopting a half galactic co - h@xmath1 conversion factor instead of the galactic one ,",
    "all results of the fitting get worse .",
    "the cause of external pressure is explained by wide - spread shock for galactic scale and cloud - cloud collisions for colliding regions .",
    "shock take a key role in both of scenarios .",
