    "<S> the dynamic coupling between giant resonance states and soft low - energy excitation , modes in weakly - bound nuclei is investigated . </S>",
    "<S> a coupled - channels calculation is reported for the reaction @xmath0 at 83 mev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the low - energy response is only marginally modified by transitions to the isovector giant dipole and isoscalar giant quadrupole resonances .    </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear response to external  electromagnetic fields is one of the main probes of the structure of nuclei far from the stability valley  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the coulomb excitation of rare isotopes in high energy collisions ( @xmath1 mev / nucleon ) has revealed the existence of  soft  excitation modes @xcite .  however , it is still an open question if these modes represent a new type of collective motion , or a resonance in the continuum , as predicted by some theories @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these soft modes can also been explained as a simple consequence of the phase - space availability of transitions from a bound - state to a structureless continuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these questions are of extreme relevance for experimental strategies , since the coulomb dissociation method has become a powerful experimental alternative to access information on the radiative capture processes occurring in numerous astrophysical scenarios @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not known if the low energy peak in the coulomb excitation cross sections of @xmath2 @xcite is due to the existence of a resonant state close to threshold . </S>",
    "<S> but , the coulomb breakup of @xmath3 is well explained by a direct transition of a bound particle state ( @xmath4  proton ) to a structureless continuum . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is caused by the action of the time - dependent electric dipole ( e1 ) and electric quadrupole ( e2 ) fields of the target nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> the resonance state at 630 kev in @xmath3 , which plays an important role in magnetic dipole ( m1 ) transitions  of  the radiative capture reaction @xmath5 occurring in the sun , is imperceptible in coulomb dissociation experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the e1 and e2 response in @xmath3 is reasonably well described by a proton + @xmath6-core model with an spectroscopic factor close to unity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this model yields an astrophysical s - factor @xmath7 ev.b at @xmath8 kev , where @xmath9 is the relative energy of the proton - beryllium system in the solar environment . </S>",
    "<S> this value of @xmath10 is the most recommended value , based on the average of numerous direct and indirect experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , it seems that the low - energy response in @xmath3  is due entirely to the promotion of a valence proton from the @xmath4 level into the continuum @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this excitation process decouples from the higher energy excitations , except in a situation where multi - step processes are relevant . </S>",
    "<S> hence , with no configuration mixing , the electromagnetic responses coincide with the free response ( with no residual interaction ) in the low energy region . </S>",
    "<S> although more elaborate models exist in the literature @xcite , i will adopt the proton + @xmath6-core model to obtain the e1 and e2 low - energy response of @xmath11b ( @xmath12 mev ) .    </S>",
    "<S> giant resonances ( grs ) are collective vibrations in nuclei and have been known for a long time ( for a review , see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> their energies and widths have been studied for a large number of nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> some experimental data have been obtained with real photons , which are well suited for ( isovector ) e1 excitation modes . </S>",
    "<S> isoscalar e2 and higher modes have been best studied with @xmath13 or proton scattering . </S>",
    "<S> e0 ( breathing ) modes have also been studied with electron and nucleus - nucleus scattering . </S>",
    "<S> nowadays a great effort is underway @xcite to understand the structure of double giant resonances , i.e. , giant resonances excited on another giant resonance state @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such studies have been performed with stable nuclear species . </S>",
    "<S> we have practically no information about giant resonances in very light nuclei ( e.g. @xmath14 ) , or in neutron or proton - rich nuclei.(e.g . , @xmath3 , or @xmath2 ) although theoretically one expects them to exist .    </S>",
    "<S> the effect of continuum - continuum transitions on the low - energy response of weakly - bound nuclei was first mentioned and studied in ref . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , intensive theoretical studies have been performed @xcite to access the relevance of continuum - continuum transitions in the breakup reactions of @xmath15 @xmath2 , and other exotic light nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> but besides the low energy continuum - continuum couplings , the giant resonances located at much higher energies could also have some influence on the low - lying states through a dynamic coupling during the reaction process . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is based on the known fact that the giant resonances exhaust the largest part of the electromagnetic response in heavy stable nuclei ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> this often leads to a large excitation cross section of giant resonance states in coulomb excitation at high bombarding energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this hypotheses is worth investigation in the case of light- neutron- or proton - rich nuclei .    in this article </S>",
    "<S> i report a study of the influence of the gr states on the soft modes . </S>",
    "<S> a continuum discretized coupled - channels calculation ( cdcc ) was done which includes nuclear and coulomb induced breakup of @xmath3 projectiles incident on heavy ( large - z ) targets . </S>",
    "<S> a microscopic description of the grs in very light nuclei , using e.g. , the random phase approximation , probably leads to unreliable results . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a more conservative approach is adopted , describing the giant dipole resonance ( gdr , @xmath16 ) and the giant quadrupole ( isoscalar ) resonance ( gqr , @xmath17 ) by means of a breit - wigner function , @xmath18 centered on the energy @xmath19 of the resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the continuum is discretized with an energy mesh around the resonances , using eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ fl ] as reference . in terms of @xmath20 , the total response function </S>",
    "<S> is given by @xmath21 where @xmath22 @xmath23 , and @xmath24  is the energy interval . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced matrix elements for the excitation of the energy state at @xmath25 from the ground state , or from a low - lying state in the continuum ( @xmath26 mev ) , are given by @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the spin of the initial state @xmath29 . </S>",
    "<S> typical values were adopted for their widths , @xmath30 mev , and for their energy centroids , @xmath31 mev and @xmath32 mev , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the constants @xmath33 are obtained by assuming that the grs exhaust 100% of the energy - weighted sum - rule . </S>",
    "<S> this yields @xmath34 where @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the neutron , charge , and mass numbers of the excited nucleus , @xmath38 is the nucleon mass , and @xmath39 is the  ground - state density matter radius . for @xmath40 the value @xmath41 fm , obtained by a skyrme - hartree - fock calculation @xcite , is used .    the values of the normalization constants in eq . </S>",

    "<S> the optical potentials @xmath53  are constructed from the ground state densities of the colliding nuclei and the t-@xmath54  approximation , as explained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the electromagnetic matrix elements for the excitation of soft e1 and e2 modes were calculated with the potential model of a proton + @xmath6-core , as presented in ref . </S>",

    "<S> the 2@xmath55 ground state of @xmath3 is described as a p@xmath56 proton coupled to a 3/2@xmath57 ground state of the @xmath58be core . </S>",

    "<S> the e2 excitations consist of transitions to p@xmath59 , p@xmath56 , f@xmath60 and f@xmath61 states . </S>",
    "<S> continuum - continuum transitions between the low - lying states have been considered in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and are not taken into account here , as we want to isolate the effect of the giant resonances . </S>",
    "<S> the form of the nuclear response for the soft - modes within this model , and for the grs according to the parametrization described by eqs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fl ] and [ bel ] , are plotted in figure 1 . </S>",
    "<S> one observes that the assumption that the grs fully exhaust the ewsrs is an overestimation . </S>",
    "<S> an appreciable part of the sum rule goes to the excitation of the soft modes , specially for the case of e2 excitations . indeed , for @xmath3  the ewsr given in eq . </S>",
    "<S> [ ewsr ] yield @xmath62 @xmath63 @xmath64 mev and @xmath65 @xmath63 @xmath66 mev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these values should be compared to the energy integrated multipole response of the soft modes : @xmath67 @xmath63 @xmath64 mev and @xmath68 @xmath63 @xmath66 mev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> although the e1 soft mode corresponds to a very small part of the total sum - rule , it is responsible for large coulomb dissociation cross sections , since low energy e1 virtual photons are much more abundant . in contrast , the e2 soft mode as obtained with the potential model , exhausts 44% of the ewsr . </S>",
    "<S> this is a hint that the potential model overestimates the magnitude of the e2 response function . indeed , a recent experiment @xcite has suggested that the momentum distributions following the coulomb breakup of @xmath3 can only be explained if the e2 response obtained from the proton + @xmath6-core model is quenched by a factor 2 .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t ]    f2.eps    the structure inputs as described above were used in a calculation using the coupled - channels code dweiko @xcite that includes relativistic dynamics , important for bombarding energies of 84 mev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> as the main interest is for the low energy region ,  the energy mesh for the continuum discretization was taken as 10 energy states equally spaced in the energy interval of 0 - 2 mev . to account for the effect of the gr </S>",
    "<S> , 20 energy states equally spaced in the interval 10 - 40 mev were taken . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the coupled - channels calculations were matched to results of first - order perturbation calculations at impact parameters larger than 50 fm .    </S>",
    "<S> the results are plotted in figure 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curve shows the cross section for the coulomb dissociation reaction @xmath69 at 84 mev / nucleon using first - order perturbation ( pt ) theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results have been normalized to the data . </S>",
    "<S> the same normalization factor was used for the coupled - channels results , shown by the dashed line . </S>",
    "<S> the first order perturbation calculation shows a small peak at @xmath70 mev @xmath71 kev due to the excitation of the 1@xmath55 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> this peak is washed - out in the coupled - channels calculations due to the mesh size used . </S>",
    "<S> the coupled - channels calculation is slightly different than the first - order perturbation results , only for energies above 0.7 mev . </S>",
    "<S> however , the correction is very small , being no larger than 2% for the whole energy interval .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the effect of the giant resonances on the coulomb dissociation cross sections of @xmath3 projectiles is small and can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> a similar conclusion is expected to hold for the breakup reactions of other weakly - bound nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the total excitation cross sections of soft modes in @xmath3for the reaction studied here are @xmath72 mb @xmath73 mb , while the cross sections for the excitation of grs are @xmath74 mb  and @xmath75 mb , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this is the reason for the small relevance of the grs in the dynamic coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the situation can be very different for the heavier nuclei which have a larger response to the electromagnetic excitation in the region of giant resonances . </S>",
    "<S> although they have not yet been studied in details experimentally , the electromagnetic response of heavy neutron- or proton - rich nuclei close to the dripline will probably contain soft multipole modes . </S>",
    "<S> these are very likely to be influenced by the dynamic coupling to the much higher - lying giant resonance states . </S>"
