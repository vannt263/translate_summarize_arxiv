    "different gauges are used in other types of lattice calculations .",
    "non - local operators can be measured in lattice qcd calculations , @xmath30 however these do not have any use in phenomenology  @xcite , because experiments are usually not sensitive to single @xmath31 fock states .",

    "the lattice qcd community are starting to create publicly available gauge configurations  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly important due to the high computational cost of unquenched calculations .",
    "an archive of gauge configurations has been running at nersc for many years .",
    "the correlator @xmath20 is a function of the light quark propagators ( @xmath37 ) averaged over the samples of the gauge fields .",
    "@xmath38 the quark propagator @xmath39 is the inverse of the fermion operator .",
    "the quark propagator depends on the gauge configurations from the gauge field dependence of the fermion action ( see  [ eq : wilsonfermion ] for example ) .",
    "the correlator in equation  [ eq : algorexplain ] is essentially computed in two stages",
    ". first the samples of the gauge configurations are generated .",
    "these are the building blocks of most lattice qcd calculations .",
    "the correlators for specific processes are computed by calculating the hadron correlator for each gauge configuration and then averaging over each gauge configuration .",
    "to better explain the idea behind computing quark propagators in lattice qcd calculations , it is helpful to consider the computation of the propagator in perturbation theory .",
    "the starting point of perturbative calculations is when the quarks do not interact with gluons .",
    "this corresponds to quarks moving in gauge potentials that are gauge transforms from the unit configuration @xmath40 under these conditions the quark propagator can be computed analytically from the fermion operator using fourier transforms ( see  @xcite for derivation ) .",
    "@xmath41 @xmath42 although in principle the propagator in equation  [ eq : freeprop ] could be used as a basis of a perturbative expansion of equation  [ eq : algorexplain ] , the physical masses depend on the coupling like @xmath43 ( see section  [ se : latticespacing ] ) , so hadron masses can not be computed using this approach .",
    "the quark propagator on its own is not gauge invariant .",
    "quark propagators are typically built into gauge invariant hadron operators . however , in a fixed gauge quark propagators can be computed and studied . this is useful for the attempts to calculate hadron spectroscopy using dyson - schwinger equations  @xcite .    in lattice",
    "qcd calculations the gauge fields have complicated space - time dependence so the quark propagator is inverted numerically using variants of the conjugate gradient algorithms  @xcite .",
    "weak coupling perturbation theory on the lattice is important for determining weak matrix elements , quark masses and the strong coupling .",
    "the sum over @xmath44 in the time slice correlator ( equation  [ eq : timeslicedcorr ] ) projects onto a specific momentum at the sink .",
    "traditionally for computational reasons , the spatial origin had to be fixed either at a point , or with a specific wave function distribution between the quarks .",
    "physically , it would be clearly better to project out onto a specific momentum at the origin .",
    "the number of spatial positions at the origin is related to the cost of the calculation .",
    "there are new lattice techniques called `` all - to - all '' that can be used to compute a quark propagator from any point to another without spending prohibitive amounts of computer time  @xcite .",
    "there have been some studies of the point to point correlator  @xcite @xmath45 it was pointed out by shuryak  @xcite that the correlator in equation  [ eq : pointtopoint ] may be more easily compared to experiment .",
    "also , the correlator  [ eq : pointtopoint ] could give some information on the density of states . in practise the point to point correlators were quite noisy .",
    "the physics from the time sliced correlator is extracted using a fit model  @xcite : @xmath46 where @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) is the ground ( first excited ) state mass and the dots represent higher excitations .",
    "there are simple corrections to equation  [ eq : fitmodel ] for the finite size of the lattice in the time direction . in practise as recently emphasised by lepage et al .",
    "@xcite , fitting masses from equation  [ eq : fitmodel ] is nontrivial .",
    "the fit region in time has to be selected as well as the number of exponentials .",
    "the situation is roughly analogous to the choice of `` cuts '' in experimental particle physics .",
    "the correlators are correlated in time , hence a correlated @xmath49 should be minimised . with limited statistics it can be hard to estimate the underlying covariance matrix making the @xmath50 test nontrivial  @xcite . as ensemble sizes have increased the problems resulting from poorly estimated covariance matrices",
    "have decreased .",
    "it is usually better to measure a matrix of correlators so that variational techniques can be used to extract the masses and amplitudes  @xcite . @xmath51",
    "the correlator in equation  [ cmn : eq : timeslicedvary ] is analysed using the fit model in equation  [ cmn : eq : timeslicedvaryanal ] . @xmath52",
    "the matrix @xmath53 is independent of time and in general has no special structure .",
    "the masses can be extracted from equation  [ cmn : eq : timeslicedvaryanal ] either by fitting or by reorganising the problem as a generalised eigenvalue problem  @xcite .",
    "obtaining the matrix structure on the right hand of equation  [ cmn : eq : timeslicedvaryanal ] is a non - trivial test of the multi - exponential fit .",
    "one piece of `` folk wisdom '' is that the largest mass extracted from the fit is some average over the truncated states , and hence is unphysical .",
    "this may explain why the excited state masses obtained from  @xcite in calculation with only two basis states were higher than any physical state    the main ( minor ) disadvantage of variational techniques is that they require more computer time , because additional quark propagators have to be computed , if the basis functions are `` smearing functions '' .",
    "if different local interpolating operators are used as basis states , as is done for studies of the roper resonance ( see section  [ cmn : se : baryonexcite ] ) , then there is no additional cost .",
    "the amount of computer time depends linearly on the number of basis states .",
    "also the basis states have to be `` significantly '' different to gain any benefit .",
    "apart from a few specialised applications  @xcite the efficacy of a basis state is not obvious until the calculations is done .",
    "although in principle excited state masses can be extracted from a multiple exponential fit , in practise this is a numerically non - trivial task , because of the noise in the data from the calculation .",
    "there is a physical argument  @xcite that explains the signal to noise ratio .",
    "the variance of the correlator in equation  [ eq : timeslicedcorr ] is : @xmath54 the square of the operator will couple to two ( three ) pion for a meson ( baryon ) .",
    "hence the noise to signal ratio for mesons is @xmath55 and noise to signal ratio for baryons is @xmath56 the signal to noise ratio will get worse as the mass of the hadron increases .    in figure  [ eq : protoncorr ]",
    "i show some data for a proton correlator .",
    "the traditional way to plot a correlator is to use the effective mass plot .",
    "@xmath57 when only the first term in equation  [ eq : fitmodel ] dominates , then equation  [ eq : effectivemass ] is a constant .",

    "the strategy used to be fit far enough out in time so that only one exponential contributed to equation  [ eq : fitmodel ] .",
    "one disadvantage of doing this is that the noise increases at larger times , hence the errors on the final physical parameters become larger  @xcite .",
    "many of the most interesting questions in hadronic physics involve the hadrons that are not the ground state with a given set of quantum numbers , hence novel techniques that can extract masses of excited states are very important .",

    "recently , there has been a new set of tools developed to extract physical parameters from the correlator @xmath20 in equation  [ eq : fitmodel ] .",
