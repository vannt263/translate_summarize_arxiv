    "the study of physical conditions of regions  is a fundamental tool to constrain models of nucleosynthesis of massive stars , galactic chemical evolution , and the chemical evolution of the universe . in the same way ,",
    "the study of the chemical composition of metal - poor regions  is crucial for the understanding of the primordial chemical composition of the universe .",
    "most of these studies have been done using abundances obtained from the so called direct method , which assumes a homogeneous temperature throughout the whole volume of the object and then uses this temperature to determine abundances of all available ions ; this temperature is commonly obtained from the [ ] collisionally excited line ratio @xmath34363/(4959 + 5007 ) ; hereafter we will call this procedure the @xmath1 method .    unfortunately , the simplification of the thermal structure of regions  implied by the @xmath1 method , yields lower abundances than those obtained with other methods .",
    "for example : ( i ) the o / h abundances derived from recombination lines , ( ii ) the o / h abundances derived by comparing the nebular lines with photoionization models , and ( iii ) the comparison of the o / h nebular abundances ( including gas and dust ) , with those derived from b stars and young f and g stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the abundances derived from these three different methods are consistent within the errors .",
    "the abundances obtained through collisionally excited lines corrected for the presence of thermal inhomogeneities are consistent with the abundances obtained through other methods . for reviews on such issue",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "abundances obtained with the @xmath1 method  are underestimated because the temperature used in the determination process is assumed to be uniform . in the presence of either local or global thermal inhomogeneities , collisionally",
    "excited lines will be brighter in the hot regions while recombination lines will be brighter in the cool regions .",
    "this leads to choosing a temperature higher than the average and thus to assume that less oxygen ( and more hydrogen ) , than the amount that is actually present , is needed in order to reproduce the observed line intensities .",
    "for this reason , these abundances should be corrected for the presence of thermal inhomogeneities before being used to calibrate any strong - line indicator .",
    "@xcite were the firsts to introduce the @xmath2 versus 12+log(o / h )  diagram ( from here on , this diagram will be referred to as the @xmath4@xmath5o / h diagram ) .",
    "they found that the sum of the intensities of nebular oxygen with respect to h@xmath6 , @xmath7([]3727 ) + @xmath7([]4959 + 5007)/@xmath7(h@xmath6 ) , varied smoothly with the total oxygen abundance and proposed to use what is now known as @xmath2 , @xmath8 , or pagel s method to determine the chemical abundances of objects where no auroral lines could be observed and , hence , no temperature could be determined . at present , more than a dozen strong - line indicators have been proposed ; of them , the most studied is @xmath2  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these strong - line indicators can be calibrated using well known abundance determinations such as the ones based on the @xmath1 method  or from fitting lines with numerical photoionization models .",
    "the quality of the abundances derived with the @xmath1 method , strongly depends on the validity of the assumption of constant temperature over the observed value . in the presence of large thermal inhomogeneities ,",
    "the @xmath1 method  will underestimate abundances since the temperature dependence of the intensity of collisionally excited lines ( such as [ ] @xmath9 4363 , 4959 , and 5007 ) is very different from that of the recombination line h@xmath6 .",
    "the intensity of collisionally excited lines is proportional to @xmath10k@xmath11 , while the intensity of h@xmath6 is proportional to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the local electron temperature , k is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath14  e is the collisional energy required to excite the line . as an alternative to avoid the problem of the large temperature dependence of collisionally excited lines , recombination lines can be used to determine abundances and calibrate the @xmath4@xmath5o / h diagram  because they have a temperature dependence given approximately by @xmath15 . for recombination line to h@xmath6 ratios , the temperature dependence almost cancels out , whereas for collisionally excited line to h@xmath6 ratios the temperature dependence does not cancel out .",
    "some work has been done in the upper branch of the diagram using recombination lines , however , these faint lines can only be observed in metal - rich objects .",
    "the discrepancy between abundances determined using recombination lines and collisionally excited lines is called the abundance discrepancy factor , adf , problem .",
    "typical values for regions  lie in the 1.5 to 3 range ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there have been two major explanations for this discrepancy : ( i ) high metallicity inclusions that will create cool high density regions surrounded by hot low density regions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and ( ii ) thermal inhomogeneities in a chemically homogeneous medium that are caused by various physical processes such as shadowed regions , advancing ionization fronts , shock waves , magnetic reconnection , etc . (",
    "e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "since the densities determined from oxygen recombination lines correlate very well with the [ ] densities @xcite , we prefer the second explanation .    in section [ tempinhom ]",
    "we discuss the corrections due to thermal inhomogeneities and due to the fraction of o depleted into dust grains . in section [ cdm ] we present a quantitative correction to the @xmath1 method , this correction is applied to the @xmath2  method in section [ recal ] . in section [ disc ]",
    "we discuss the relation between the o@xmath16 fraction and the intensity of the [ ] and [ ] nebular lines .",
    "finally , in section [ conc ] we present the conclusions .",
    "the formalism to study the chemical abundances in the presence of thermal inhomogeneities was introduced by @xcite and @xcite , where the parameter that characterizes such thermal inhomogeneities was defined as @xmath0 . in these works",
    "it was recognized that thermal inhomogeneities would produce systematic differences in temperatures determined from different methods , and that abundances determined with each one of those temperatures would also present systematic differences .",
    "the abundances determined using the @xmath1 method  were approximately a factor of 2.5 lower than those determined using the same collsionally excited line intensities including the effect of thermal inhomogeneities .",
    "there are several ways to obtain a @xmath0  value , six of them are discussed in @xcite .",
    "these are based on the comparison of : ( i ) the o@xmath16 abundances obtained using [ ] lines versus abundances obtained using lines ; ( ii ) the temperature derived from lines versus the temperatures derived from [ ] and [ ] lines ; ( iii ) the temperatures derived from the ratio of the balmer and paschen continua to the balmer line intensities versus the temperatures derived from [ ] and [ ] lines ; ( iv ) the c@xmath16 abundances derived using [ ] and ] lines versus abundances obtained from lines ; ( v ) 1.5@xmath17 columnar temperatures determined from a high spatial resolution map of the orion nebula @xcite ; and ( vi ) the calibrations of the @xmath2  method using observations versus those using photoionization models . in all cases , the @xmath0  values are consistent with each other , which implies that those objects are chemically homogeneous .",
    "the first two methods are the most used to determine @xmath0 .    independently of the effects of the thermal structure",
    ", there is an additional correction due to dust depletion that should be taken into account to determine abundances .",
    "@xcite found that the depletion of oxygen into dust grains in the orion nebula amounted to a 0.08 dex correction in the o / h ratio ; slightly higher estimates of this correction have been found in recent studies of the orion nebula @xcite . from the depletion of mg ,",
    "si , and fe in galactic and extragalactic regions , @xcite estimated an o / h correction ranging from 0.09 to 0.11 dex that increases with increasing o / h ratios .",
    "we have used the correction recommended by peimbert et al .",
    "for all the objects of our sample ; this corrections amounts to 0.11 dex for those objects whose gaseous oxygen abundance is 12+log(o / h)@xmath18 , 0.10 dex for objects with @xmath1912+log(o / h)@xmath20 , and 0.09 for those objects with @xmath2112+log(o / h ) .",
    "due to the inconsistencies presented when comparing abundances obtained with the @xmath1 method  and those obtained with , recombination lines , photoionization models , and using abundances of recently formed stars ; it is clear that abundances derived from the @xmath1 method  are systematically underestimated .",
    "this needs to be corrected by considering the thermal structure of the object and the fraction of oxygen depleted into dust grains .",
    "table [ trec ]  lists the sample we used to correct the @xmath1 method .",
    "the sample consists on six galaxies , eight galactic regions , and 14 extragalactic regions .",
    "this total of 28 objects were gathered from the literature and , in each of them , at least one value of @xmath0  was obtained . for the cases where there was more than one @xmath0  value we took the one presented as average or the one from the brightest observed region .",
    "based on detailed analysis presented in the literature it follows that the total oxygen abundance should be higher due to the effects of the thermal structure on the emitted spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) and that the fraction of o depleted into dust grains should be taken into account ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section [ tempinhom ] ) .",
    "we expect the magnitude of these effects to depend on the oxygen abundance and , possibly , on the oxygen excitation degree . in order to take these factors into account",
    ", we considered that the abundances derived from the @xmath1 method  should be corrected with a function @xmath22 dependent on the oxygen ionization degree and on the oxygen abundance determined from the @xmath1 method , ( o / h)@xmath23 : @xmath24 where calm stands for corrected auroral line method . throughout this paper",
    "all oxygen abundances are given in units of 12+log(o / h ) .",
    "as a first approximation to the function @xmath22 , we decided to use a linear correction of the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 are constants .",
    "all abundances determined for our sample were corrected for ( i ) the presence of thermal inhomogeneities and ( ii ) the fraction of oxygen depleted into dust grains .",
    "we have found that the difference between these corrected abundances and those determined with the @xmath1 method  lie in the 0.16 to 0.40 dex range .",
    "we found very little dependence with oxygen degree of ionization : @xmath28 and @xmath29 are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "since the dependence with ionization degree is small and consistent with zero we will ignore it .",
    "figure [ ecrecal ] presents the oxygen abundance correction dependence with oxygen abundance for the objects of our sample .",
    "the best fit is obtained with @xmath26 and @xmath27 equal to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively : @xmath34 this implies a corrected oxygen abundance : @xmath35 the points in figure [ ecrecal ] show considerable dispersion ; this is not surprising , because ( i ) the errors in the determination of each @xmath0  value are large and ( ii ) the true value of @xmath0  for each object depends on the details of the object ( see figure 4 of * ? ? ? * ) . to test for the statistical significance of this correlation we calculated a spearman s correlation statistic of @xmath36",
    ", this suggests that the correlation is real with 95% confidence . when comparing the dispersion with the uncertainties on the oxygen abundance determinations for this sample we calculated @xmath37 ; showing that about half of this dispersion comes from the uncertainties of the determination of @xmath0 ; meaning that approximately half of the dispersion comes from the unique physical conditions of each object .",
    "@xmath2  is now being widely used to determine abundances in objects with low intrinsic brightness or objects with low to intermediate redshift ( @xmath38 up to 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath2  method remains one of the most popular strong line indicators because ( i ) it is based directly on oxygen lines , ( ii ) it includes lines from the 2 relevant ionization stages , ( iii ) the lines it uses are the most intense for most regions , and ( iv ) these lines lie in the blue part of the spectrum and can be observed from the ground for higher redshifts than other methods .",
    "unfortunately , the curve in the @xmath4@xmath5o / h diagram  is double valued ( see figure [ figrecal ] ) ; this occurs because : at low metallicities , the main cooler in regions  is the hydrogen atom ; with increasing element abundances , the cooling due to oxygen nebular lines increases , hence , the value of @xmath2  increases reaching a maximum value of @xmath2@xmath39 when 12+log(o / h)@xmath40 ; then , at higher metallicities , the ir [ ] , ir [ ] , and optical [ ] lines begin to dominate the cooling so that the total value of @xmath2  decreases as the metallicity increases @xcite .",
    "also , there is a noticeable dependence on the oxygen ionization degree ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in a series of articles @xcite and @xcite , presented an analytic family of curves for each branch of the @xmath4@xmath5o / h diagram .",
    "this family of curves depends on the oxygen excitation degree across the object ; defining the @xmath41 parameter as the observable oxygen excitation ratio , @xmath41= ( [ ] 4959 + 5007)/ ( [ ] 3727 + [ ] 4959 + 5007 ) , and presenting two equations to determine the upper and lower branch abundances as a function of ( o / h)@xmath42=@xmath22(@xmath41,@xmath2 ) .",
    "this calibration is based on abundances determined using the @xmath1 method .",
    "unfortunately , depending on the calibration , resultant o / h values can vary by as much as 0.6 dex @xcite .",
    "this large dispersion in the calibrations mainly comes from what was chosen to be adjusted : ( i ) the theoretical intensities given by photoionization models , ( ii ) abundances derived from the @xmath1 method , or ( iii ) abundances derived from observations of oxygen recombination lines .",
    "the lowest determinations for the gaseous oxygen abundances are those that come from using the @xmath1 method , therefore they require the correction due to thermal inhomogeneities ; additionally , to obtain the total oxygen abundances , a correction of @xmath43 dex due o depletion into dust grains is required .",
    "we find that , among all the calibrations of the @xmath4@xmath5o / h diagram  available in the literature , the one presented by @xcite is the most adequate for this work since it explicitly includes the oxygen ionization degree through the @xmath41 parameter .",
    "the calibration of @xcite , ( o / h)@xmath42 , used abundances that were determined with the @xmath1 method ; hence , abundances are underestimated but this allows us to use equation [ dmc ] to correct them since ( o / h)@xmath42 has abundances determined with the @xmath1 method  at its core .",
    "we can determine oxygen abundances from a recalibration of the @xmath2  method , ( o / h)@xmath44 , by substituting ( o / h)@xmath44 and ( o / h)@xmath42 in place of ( o / h)@xmath45 and ( o / h)@xmath23 into equation ( [ dmc ] ) .",
    "we take ( o / h)@xmath42 from equation [ 22 ] and [ 24 ] of pilyugin and thuan for the upper and lower branches , respectively , to obtain two recalibrated families of curves that now simultaneously consider the thermal structure , the ionization structure , and the depleted fraction of o into dust grains .",
    "the oxygen abundance for the upper branch ( which shifted from 12+log(o / h)@xmath468.25 up to 12+log(o / h)@xmath478.55 ) , can be estimated from : + @xmath48 while the oxygen abundance for the lower branch ( which shifted from 12+log(o / h)@xmath498.00 up to 12+log(o / h)@xmath508.29 ) , can be estimated from : + @xmath51    figure [ figrecal ] shows these recalibrations of the upper and lower branches for different oxygen ionization degrees , while figure [ frecalpt ] compares the calibration presented in this work and that of @xcite to the data from table [ trec ] .",
    "something missing when using the @xmath41 parameter is a quantitative connection with the o@xmath16 fraction in the nebulae .",
    "we will define the o@xmath16 ionization degree as : @xmath52    since there is a tight relationship between the parameter @xmath41 and the o@xmath16 ionization degree ( see figure [ ecoipv3 ] ) , the fraction of o@xmath16 in the object can be estimated through the the following equation : @xmath53 this equation allows us to statistically estimate the o@xmath16 ionization degree directly from the observable @xmath41 without having to make a lengthy analysis of the ionic abundances .",
    "it should be noted that while this relation shows no significant bias with the o / h ratio , more points are needed to confirm the lack of bias or to estimate the relevance of the oxygen abundance in this correlation .",
    "we used a sample of 28 regions  obtained from the literature , with @xmath0  values ranging from 0.020 to 0.120 , to present an important correction to the abundances derived with the @xmath1 method , as well as a recalibration of pagel s strong - line method , @xmath2 to determine chemical abundances .",
    "both , the correction and the recalibration consider the thermal and ionization structure of the object , as well as the fraction of oxygen depleted into dust grains .",
    "we found that the differences between the corrected abundances and those determined with the @xmath1 method  lie in the 0.22 to 0.35 dex range .",
    "almost all previous calibrations of the @xmath4@xmath5o / h diagram  in the literature have considered a homogeneous temperature throughout the object .",
    "the recalibration presented in equations [ reca ]  and [ recb ] , is the first to simultaneously consider the thermal structure of the photoionized object , the ionization structure , and the correction due to the fraction of oxygen depleted into dust grains .",
    "this recalibration is particularly useful for objects with low to intermediate redshifts ( up to @xmath54 ) .",
    "we find that the o@xmath16 ionization degree shows a surprisingly almost one - to - one relation with the parameter @xmath41 , thus ensuring that a calibration which considers @xmath41 is directly considering the oxygen ionization structure of the object .",
    "given that all strong - line indicators attempt to determine the total oxygen abundance as means of estimating the heavy element content , and that all the observational calibrations have been done using abundances determined with the @xmath1 method , the oxygen correction presented in this paper should be used to recalibrate other strong - line indicators in the literature .",
    "the up - shifting of the family of curves in the @xmath4@xmath5o / h diagram  found in this work , has important consequences in various areas of astrophysics such as the determination of : initial mass functions , star formation rates , luminosity functions , yields , radial metallicity gradients of spiral galaxies , and chemical evolution models of the universe .",
