    "with the advent of new - generation electron accelerators such as cebaf , experiments on elastic electron  proton scattering in the gev - range were brought to the new level of precision .",
    "one of the novel features of the experiments is that in addition to the scattered electron , the momentum of recoil proton can be directly measured , while both the electron beam and the proton target may be polarized .",
    "the cross section depends only on one kinematic variable , so the measurement of final momenta gives several possibilities to reconstruct this kinematic variable from measurements .",
    "it results in different methods of data analysis , the best of them being chosen from experimental conditions such as resolution and others .",
    "often it is used for reducing influence of radiative effects , which accompany any process with electrons .",
    "ref.@xcite presents a review of the radiative corrections calculations under different approaches of kinematic variable reconstructions in experiments at hera .    in this paper",
    "we consider the case of elastic measurement @xmath1 where the initial electron is polarized longitudinally and only momentum of the final proton is measured or is used in @xmath2 reconstruction .",
    "the corresponding method is known as reconstruction within hadronic variables @xcite .",
    "there are two types of such experiments . in the first type",
    "the proton is considered to be polarized either longitudinally or transversely . in the second case",
    "the polarization states of recoil proton are measured .",
    "we calculate radiative corrections ( see fig.[feyn ] ) for these measurements and for hadronic variables reconstruction method .",
    "measurement of final proton momentum allows to define three independent kinematic variables .",
    "a natural choice for them are @xmath3 , azimuthal angle and so - called inelasticity @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the electron mass .",
    "since at the born level @xmath6 and @xmath7 if the additional photon is emitted in the final state of ( [ process ] ) , one can constrain ( or cut ) the range of @xmath8 to reduce value of radiative corrections ( rc ) .",
    "we calculate rc to the cross sections and asymmetries differential in @xmath3 .",
    "when leptonic variables reconstruction method is used , the integration over photonic momentum phase space can not be performed analytically .",
    "the reason is that an argument of formfactors ( @xmath3 transferred to the proton ) depends on the photon momentum .",
    "so the integration is left for numerical analysis in order to avoid additional assumptions about specific models for formfactors .",
    "the advantage of the reconstruction method in terms of hadronic variables is that the integration can be performed analytically and completely both for unpolarized and polarized parts of the cross section .",
    "a more detailed discussion of advantages of rc calculation for elastic scattering within leptonic and hadronic variables can be found in ref.@xcite    there are two possibilities in considering the polarization parts of the cross section .",
    "we consider different polarization states .",
    "it corresponds to different coefficients of expansion of polarization vectors , while the form of the expansion is the same .",
    "since these coefficients depend on inelasticity ( see section 2 ) , which is a function of photon momentum , we can produce either formulae for all specific polarization cases or get only one set of formulae for the polarization states but leaving integration over inelasticity for numerical analysis .",
    "we choose the second way .",
    "we will see in section 3 , that obtained formulae are very simple even in the general case .",
    "we use the approach of bardin and shumeiko @xcite for this calculation .",
    "advantages of the approach are absence of any approximations both in the procedure of extraction and cancellation of infrared divergent terms and in integration over photon phase space",
    ". however it is known that mass singularity terms still remain within these formulae . in our case",
    "we perform additional procedure to extract these mass singularity terms .",
    "the result of the expansion can be presented as @xmath9 where independent on electron mass functions @xmath10 and @xmath11 appear as lo and nlo contribution to the cross section .",
    "the explicit formulae in the form of ( [ expansion ] ) are presented in section 3 .",
