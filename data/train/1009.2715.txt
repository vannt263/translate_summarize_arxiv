    "the initial selection focused on @xmath03 samples .",
    "the same colour criteria were later extended to select lyman break galaxies at 1.4@xmath12z@xmath122.5 ( the so called bx@xmath1bm objects ) with approximately the same range of uv luminosity and intrinsic uv colours as the @xmath03 lbgs ( reddy et al .",

    "a number of issues related to the nature and properties of @xmath03 lbgs remain unclear",
    ". the dust - corrected star formation rate ( sfr ) of lbgs can be as high as 100 m@xmath8/yr , which would correspond to @xmath16 1mjy depending on specific dust parameters ( chapman et al .",
    "2009 ) . however , the search for the sub - millimetre ( submm ) counterparts of lbgs has proven challenging due to uncertainties in the relations used to predict the rest - frame far - infrared luminosity from the uv .",
    "peacock et al . ( 2000 ) analysed the submm emission from star forming galaxies with the highest uv star - formation rates and found that they were statistically detected with a flux density s@xmath17=0.2 mjy for a star formation rate of 1 h@xmath18 m@xmath19 .",

    "in this letter we report first results on the far - infrared properties of lbgs based on observations that are part of the _ herschel _ multi - tiered extragalactic survey ( hermes ) , a guaranteed time project that will eventually result in a variety of surveys of varying depth and area which will be covered in five photometric bands ( 110 , 160 , 250 , 350 , 500 @xmath2 m ; oliver et al .",

    "the method uses a matrix inversion technique which relies on the assumption that sources detected in the 250 @xmath2 m band will also be detected at 24 @xmath2 m deep surveys ( e.g. marsden et al .",

    "we discuss the properties of individual sources in section 2.3 .    to assess the reliability of spire detections at faint flux levels ( @xmath2920 mjy ) close to the confusion limit we first look at the flux distribution ( per pixel ) of the whole goods - n map .",
    "for the present discussion we focus on the 250 @xmath2 m band which is the most sensitive and has the smallest beamsize ( 18@xmath30 ) .",
    "we find that the fraction of pixels above 5 , 10 and 20 mjy is 6 , 4 and 0.6 percent , respectively .",
    "these percentages imply that 16(4.5 ) , 10(3 ) and 1.5(0.23 ) sources out of the 270(78 ) sources studied here could be associated with spurious detections at 5 , 10 and 20 mjy .",

    "we exclude sources near bright objects ( within 18@xmath30 at 250 @xmath2 m ) to avoid contamination of the measured signal . stacking the uv selected samples returned no detections in any of the three spire bands .",
    "for the lbgs we determine 3@xmath26 upper limits of @xmath312.8 mjy , @xmath321.5mjy and @xmath330.9mjy . for the bx@xmath1bms",

    "the distributions have positive skews and in the case of lbgs there is a clear positive tail implying that pixels containing flux from the lbgs have higher flux than the average pixel in the map . the case for the bx@xmath1bms",
    "is not as clear .",
    "although the bx@xmath1bm sample is bigger ( 69 objects vs 9 ) the population as a whole does not appear to strongly emit in the submm . in order to confirm that the two distributions are in fact different , we carry out a k - s two - sample test .",
    "the test results , _ d_= 0.31 and ( probability ) @xmath34(_d _ ) = 0.03 , suggest that the two flux density distributions are intrinsically different at the 2@xmath26 level .",
    "the mean flux densities are @xmath3 = 5.9@xmath41.4 mjy ( lbg ) and @xmath3 = 2.7@xmath40.8 mjy ( bx@xmath1bm ) .",
    "the errors reported in these measurements have been quantified by stacking at 9 ( for the lbgs ) and 69 ( for the bx@xmath1bms ) random positions and then repeating the process 40,000 times .",
    "the 1@xmath26 value of the derived distribution is adopted as the uncertainty of the measurement .",
    "stacking at 350 and 500 @xmath2 m resulted in no formal detections .",

    "a likely physical explanation for this difference in detection rates comes from the mir properties of the two samples . for @xmath03",
    "lbgs the mips 24@xmath2 m band contains contributions from 6@xmath2 m ( hot ) dust continuum plus the 6.2 @xmath2 m emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) .",
    "the pah contribution to the mips 24@xmath2 m flux is @xmath102030 percent ( e.g. huang et al . 2005 ) , therefore , the mips 24 @xmath2 m flux mostly reflects the strength of the underlying continuum .",
    "thus , the mips detected lbgs ( with the strongest 6 @xmath2 m continuum ) are likely to be amongst the most luminous @xmath03 lbgs . for z@xmath102",
    "bx@xmath1bms the mips 24@xmath2 m band includes contributions from both the 7.7@xmath2 m pah feature and the underlying continuum . however , z@xmath102 galaxy populations show a wide variety in their @xmath35 rest - frame luminosity , with bx@xmath1bms , in particular showing a relatively weak mir continuum ( reddy 2006b )",
    ". pahs in bx@xmath1bms , might be instrinsically weak since metallicity is known to affect their strength ( houck et al . 2005 )",
    ". the combination of low mir continuum plus weaker pah features may be responsible for the low detection rate in the submm of 24 @xmath2 m selected bx@xmath1bms .",
    "we thus conclude that , @xmath03 lbgs detected by mips are likely to be on average more luminous than mips detected @xmath02 bx@xmath1bms .      in the previous section we examined the average submm properties of lbgs and bx@xmath1bms here we take a closer look at individual detections , focusing on objects with mips detections .",
    "as discussed in section 2.1 of the 69 mips - bx@xmath1bm objects , 3 are detected with @xmath36 20mjy and s@xmath1n @xmath13 3 however , two of those , bx1296 and bx1223 lie close ( within @xmath29 3@xmath37 ) to bright submm galaxies , bx1296 to gn07 and bx1223 to gn06 ( the notation is from pope et al .",

    "2006 , 2010 , adelberger and steidel 2000 ) , the difference in the @xmath72 ratio must be attributed to different causes . while selection effects are likely to play a role ( see section 2.2 ) we argue that possible differences in morphologies , dust distribution and extent of star - forming regions are also likely to contribute .",
    "morphological studies of uv - selected @xmath02 and z@xmath103 galaxies in the goods - n field find few differences between the two samples ( law et al .",

    "<S> we present first results of a study of the submillimetre ( rest frame far - infrared ) properties of @xmath03 lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) and their lower - redshift counterparts bx@xmath1bm galaxies , based on _ </S>",
    "<S> herschel_-spire observations of the northern field of the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods - n ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use stacking analysis to determine the properties of lbgs well below the current limit of the survey . although lbgs are not detected individually , stacking the infrared luminous lbgs ( those detected with spitzer at 24 @xmath2 m ) yields a statistically significant submm detection with mean flux @xmath3= 5.9@xmath41.4 mjy confirming the power of spire in detecting uv - selected high - redshift galaxies at submillimetre wavelengths . in comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the spitzer 24 @xmath2 m detected bx@xmath1bm galaxies appear fainter with a stacked value of @xmath3 = 2.7@xmath40.8 mjy . by fitting the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) </S>",
    "<S> we derive median infrared luminosities , @xmath5 , of 2.8@xmath610@xmath7l@xmath8 and 1.5@xmath610@xmath9l@xmath8 for @xmath03 lbgs and bx@xmath1bms , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath5 estimates derived from present measurements are in good agreement with those based on uv data for z@xmath102 bx@xmath1bm galaxies , unlike the case for @xmath03 infrared luminous lbgs where the uv underestimates the true @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> although sample selection effects may influence this result we suggest that differences in physical properties ( such as morphologies , dust distribution and extent of star - forming regions ) between @xmath03 lbgs and z@xmath102 bx@xmath1bms may also play a significant role .    </S>",
