    "<S> the polar codes are proven to be capacity - achieving and are shown to have equivalent or even better finite - length performance than the turbo / ldpc codes under some improved decoding algorithms over the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channels . </S>",
    "<S> polar coding is based on the so - called channel polarization phenomenon induced by a transform over the underlying binary - input channel . </S>",
    "<S> the channel polarization is found to be universal in many signal processing problems and has been applied to the coded modulation schemes . in this paper , the channel polarization </S>",
    "<S> is further extended to the multiple antenna transmission following a multilevel coding principle . </S>",
    "<S> the multiple - input multile - output ( mimo ) channel under quadrature amplitude modulation ( qam ) are transformed into a series of synthesized binary - input channels under a three - stage channel transform . </S>",
    "<S> based on this generalized channel polarization , the proposed space - time polar coded modulation ( stpcm ) scheme allows a joint optimization of the binary polar coding , modulation and mimo transmission . in addition , a practical solution of polar code construction over the fading channels is also provided , where the fading channels are approximated by an awgn channel which shares the same capacity with the original . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations over the mimo channel with uncorrelated rayleigh fast fading show that the proposed stpcm scheme can outperform the bit - interleaved turbo coded scheme in all the simulated cases , where the latter is adopted in many existing communication systems .    </S>",
