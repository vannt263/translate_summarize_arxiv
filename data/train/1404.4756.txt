    "the simple random walker is one of the most important conceptual tools in statistical physics .",
    "it lies behind our understanding of diffusive motions in thermal equilibrium , and almost every statistical estimate makes use of its properties based on the central limit theorem  @xcite .",
    "it is also useful in the biological context , because it explains many behavioral aspects of micro - organisms swimming in a viscous liquid  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments report another biological application of random walks , performed by repair proteins along one - dimensional dna sequences  @xcite .",
    "the experimental results show the followings : first , the net displacements are distributed symmetrically from the starting point .",
    "second , the mean - squared displacement is found to increase linearly with time .",
    "these are exactly the characteristics of the simple random walk .",
    "such a diffusive process is found efficient both in energy and time : the proteins slide along dna without requiring atp because the process is driven by thermal energy , and the group of repair proteins in a cell would check the entire genome sequence within 3 minutes even if this one - dimensional diffusion was the only scanning mechanism  @xcite .",
    "there are also interesting variations of the simple random walk , one of which is the persistent random walk  @xcite .",
    "the persistent random walker has a ` memory ' or ` momentum ' in the sense that it takes a step in the same direction as the previous one with probability , say , @xmath2 , and in the opposite direction with @xmath3 .",
    "such dynamics introduces correlation in the walker s displacements .",
    "however , when we talk about its ` memory ' , it should be understood in a rather loose sense , because this model can still be described by a second - order markovian process , which is essentially memoryless .",
    "the precise way to introduce persistence depends on the detailed mechanism that we are to describe . in this work",
    ", we consider a slightly different type of a persistent random walker which has an external state as its position together with an internal state that prescribes its direction .",
    "the walker receives as an input a binary string composed of 1 and 0 .",
    "the former bit acts on the external state , moving the walker by one discrete step in the prescribed direction .",
    "the latter , on the other hand , acts only on the internal state with flipping the direction .",
    "the point is that there occurs no displacement in the latter situation , differing from the conventional persistent random walk .",
    "therefore , in terms of the displacement , there are three possibilities , i.e. , -1 , 0 , and + 1 , at each time step .",
    "such persistence as considered in this work due to the separation of internal and external variables is actually possible in some transport phenomena , for example , if the walker has a ratchet , which forces the motion in a particular direction but is controllable by inputs from outside .",
    "if the input string is random so that it contains 1 with probability @xmath0 and 0 with probability @xmath4 , our model can be analyzed by solving a second - order markovian process with the generation - function method .",
    "in addition , it is also possible to obtain the generating function for the returning probability in a closed form at @xmath5 .",
    "this work is organized as follows : in the next section , we present analytic results for the movement of this random walker by using the generating - function method .",
    "how it returns to the starting point will be discussed in sec .",

    "its position is represented by an integer @xmath8 .",
    "we assume that the walker starts from the origin , i.e. , @xmath9 , at time @xmath10 .",
    "every time step , the walker reads a bit from an input string which we denote as @xmath11 with @xmath12 at probability @xmath0 and @xmath13 at probability @xmath14 for @xmath15 .",
    "the probability for the walker to occupy position @xmath8 at time @xmath16 is denoted as @xmath17 , where the superscript means the initial direction , @xmath18 or @xmath19 , of the walker . our initial condition is such that the walker is located at the origin with the positive direction , as expressed by @xmath20 and @xmath21 . at time @xmath22",
    ", we have @xmath23 where the first term corresponds to the case with @xmath24 , which is equivalent to shifting the walker by one lattice spacing .",

    "( [ eq : ut+1 ] ) , we have an expression for @xmath47 when @xmath16 is even , too .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : utpq ] ) simplifies for @xmath5 due to the following identity in combinatorics : @xmath66 we restrict ourselves to this specific case of @xmath5 henceforth .",

    "together with @xmath48 , one can find @xmath47 recursively by using eq .",

    "we have fixed the parameter @xmath0 at @xmath73 to compare the numerical results over @xmath46 random samples ( symbols ) with the analytic ones ( dotted ) from eqs .",

    "it is a standard exercise  @xcite to decompose @xmath75 into @xmath76 according to the first return time . denoting the generating function for @xmath72 as @xmath77 we may rewrite eq .",

    "( [ eq : fx ] ) is an odd function , because the first return after leaving the origin is impossible when @xmath16 is even .",
    "we have checked the expressions for @xmath47 and @xmath72 with monte carlo calculation and drawn the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : return ] .",

    "we decompose @xmath83 according to the first return time @xmath84 : if the first return time is @xmath84 , it means that there must be at least @xmath85 returns among the @xmath86 possible trajectories in total .",

    ", we find that the singularity is dominated by the first term on the right - hand side . as a result , if @xmath101 , the average number of returns scales as @xmath102 which is similar to the case of the simple random walk  @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have considered a variant of the persistent random walk and calculated its statistical properties by using the generating - function method . in the limit of @xmath39 ,",
    "the distribution of the position approaches the gaussian function , and both the mean and variance are scaled by the factor of @xmath103 .",
