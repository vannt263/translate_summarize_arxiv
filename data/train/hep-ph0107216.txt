    "there have been many studies@xcite that have pointed out the complementarity between experiments at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and at @xmath0 linear colliders ( lc ) that are being considered as the next major high energy accelerator facility after the lhc .",
    "high energy hadron colliders with general purpose hermetic detectors are ideal for broad band searches of new phenomena@xcite . while some recent studies ( performed within the context of specific supersymmetric models ) have shown that it may be possible to make precision measurements of masses ( more specifically , mass differences)@xcite and possibly other attributes of new particles @xcite , experiments at the lc allow a relatively model - independent determination of masses @xcite and other properties of higgs bosons and supersymmetric ( susy ) particles assuming that these are kinematically accessible , in addition to more detailed@xcite measurements specific to particular models .",
    "the original studies @xcite of sparticle mass measurements at linear colliders rely largely on kinematic reconstruction of masses ; _",
    "e.g. _ for the measurement of @xmath6 , the energy distributions of the electrons in @xmath7 is , except for effects of cuts and resolution smearing , flat with sharp end points determined only by @xmath6 and @xmath8 . it has been shown that with several tens of fb@xmath2 , experiments at lcs should measure these masses with a precision at the percent level .",
    "a similar precision was shown to be possible for the determination of the lighter chargino mass , even though the energy spectrum of the visible daughters is not flat .",
    "the same idea was extended to sparticles decaying via cascades ; _",
    "e.g_. @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the end points of the electron energy distribution are determined by just @xmath5 and @xmath12 .",
    "again , these sparticle masses were shown to be measureable at the 1 - 2% level @xcite . in all these studies ,",
    "longitudinal polarization of the electron beam was essential to control standard model ( sm ) backgrounds and susy contamination .",
    "very recently , in the tesla technical design report @xcite , it has been emphasized that the tunability of the energy of a lc may be used to perform an energy scan close to a new production threshold .",
    "it is claimed that in some cases ( @xmath13 ) this allows sparticle masses to be determined with a precision of a part per mille at a lc .",
    "specifically , it was suggested that this could be achieved by a threshold scan of the cross section ( 10 points spaced 1 gev apart with an integrated luminosity of 10  fb@xmath2/point ) in any particular channel chosen so that sm backgrounds and susy contamination is small .",
    "further , these results were extrapolated to argue that masses of the heavier sleptons of the second and third generations @xmath14 and @xmath15 could also be measured with a precision of about 0.5% .",
    "for the measurements of third generation sleptons , it was assumed that secondary vertex detection would serve to efficiently tag tau leptons . without making any representation about whether or not this is possible , we will assume this to be true for our analysis .",
    "we will , therefore , optimistically assume that light flavour and gluon jets are not a background for hadronically decaying taus , and further , that leptonically decaying isolated taus will always be distinguished from prompt @xmath16s and @xmath17s by their displaced vertices .",
    "if sparticle masses can indeed be determined with the impressive precision listed in ref.@xcite it should serve to strigently test various models of how susy breaking is mediated to the superpartners of sm particles .",
    "blair , porod and zerwas @xcite have clearly illustrated how such measurements could be used to test scalar mass unification expected within the msugra framework . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is shown how precise determination of the light chargino and both selectron masses could be used to determine the intra - generational slepton mass splitting at the grand unification scale .",
    "this , in turn , will allow distinction between the msugra and the minimal gaugino mediation @xcite framework for which the sparticle mass spectra are qualitatively very similar . measurements of third generation sparticle masses are particularly interesting since these may contain information about the yukawa sector which may be otherwise difficult to obtain .",
    "for instance , determination of @xmath18 with a precision of 2 - 3% could provide striking confirmation of tau neutrino yukawa interactions @xcite .",
    "it is clear from these considerations that if sparticle masses can be determined at the part per mille or even the subpercent level , measurements at a lc would provide extremely stringent tests of the underlying framework . in view of its potential importance",
    ", we felt that the precision claimed in ref .",
    "@xcite warranted a careful re - examination . in this paper",
    ", we examine in detail the prospects of measuring second and third generation sneutrino masses via the energy dependence of the cross section . within all susy models with lepton flavour conservation these",
    "are produced only via @xmath19-channel @xmath20 exchange and the cross sections are rather small , just a few gev beyond the production threshold .",
    "the electron sneutrino case is somewhat different because it typically has a much larger cross section since it can also be produced via chargino exchange in the @xmath21-channel .",
    "moreover , selectron and @xmath22 pair production ( due to the much larger production cross section ) can be a significant source of susy contamination for the @xmath23 or @xmath24 signal .",
    "we find that at least for the second and third generation sneutrinos , the event rate in relatively background free channels is too small to allow a threshold scan .",
    "instead we propose an alternative strategy by which the mass may be extracted and make projections for the precision with which this might be possible . while our focus is on electron and muon type sneutrinos , for completeness we also examine the precision with which @xmath5 might be obtained at a lc .",
    "we base our results on the analysis of two msugra case studies with somewhat different kinematics and cascade decay patterns of sneutrinos .",
    "the first case is the one examined in the tesla technical design report @xcite for which the parameters are , @xmath25 the second case that we choose was studied in ref.@xcite to gain some idea of how well the tau sneutrino mass could be extracted .",
    "the corresponding model parameters are , @xmath26 several sparticle masses along with relevant branching fractions are shown in table [ tab : cases ] .",
    "we see that for both these cases @xmath27 the mass of the lightest neutral scalar in the higgs boson sector is well below the current lep bound@xcite of 113  gev so that it is quite likely that these cases are experimentally excluded .",
    "the reason that we have chosen these cases is to facilitate comparisions with the earlier studies where the precision with which the sneutrino masses could be obtained was also examined .",
    "is quite irrelevant to our analysis .",
    "] we should mention a peculiar feature of case  i. here , @xmath28 is just slightly larger than @xmath29 so that the decay @xmath30 competes with other three - body decays .",
    "the decay patterns of @xmath31 are thus unusually sensitive to the mass spectrum , and indirectly therefore , also to our choice @xmath32  gev .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we compare the technique based on the energy dependence of the cross section ( of which the threshold scan is a particular case ) with that based on kinematic reconstruction of masses as in earlier studies @xcite .",
    "we point out some issues that potentially degrade the mass precision that will be attained in experiments at a lc . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] we propose how one might optimize an energy scan in relatively clean channels where the signal is rate - limited so that a threshold scan is not possible because the signal is tiny in the vicinity of the threshold . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we apply this method and assess how accurately @xmath3 and @xmath4 might be determined in experiments at a lc .",
    "we also examine the precision with which the electron sneutrino mass might be measured . in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] , we examine other potential channels for the extraction of @xmath4 and @xmath3 but find that these suffer from significant backgrounds ; in contrast , for @xmath5 we find that some improvement may be possible , at least in favourable cases , by combining the signal on several channels .",
    "we present a summary of our results along with general conclusions in sec .",
    "the extraction of the sneutrino mass from the energy dependence of the cross section is essentially a counting experiment .",
    "we have either to work in a channel that is relatively free of sm background and contamination from other susy sources , or develop a procedure for reliably subtracting these backgrounds . generally speaking",
    ", the latter would be preferable in that it allows for a larger signal ( since we do not have to limit ourselves to any particular channel ) but we will see later that both sm backgrounds as well as susy contamination can be large . moreover , in many susy models , all three generations of sneutrinos are expected to be approximately degenerate ; as a result , the background from @xmath33 production to second or third generation sneutrino production will have essentially the same energy dependence , and so will be difficult to subtract in a reliable manner using the data below the signal threshold . in the following we will , therefore , mainly focus our attention on the @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) channel with @xmath36 where both sm backgrounds as well as susy contamination to @xmath24 ( @xmath23 ) pair production are relatively small for a right polarized electron beam .",
    "channel used for the extraction of the electron sneutrino mass from the energy distributions of electrons from @xmath37 decay @xcite . in this study , where it was important not to confuse a lepton from chargino decay with the electron from the primary decay of the sneutrino , this lepton was required to be @xmath17 . here , since we do not need to identify the lepton from sneutrino decay , we allow this to be either @xmath16 or @xmath17 to increase the signal . ]",
    "the inclusion of other channels results in substantial sm background and/or susy contamination as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bf ] , we show contours of sneutrino mass as well as those for the branching fraction for the decay chain , @xmath38 in the @xmath39 plane for @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this is the sign of @xmath17 favoured by the e821 experiment @xcite . for this sign of @xmath17",
    "the chargino tends to be lighter so that there is more phase space for the cascade decay of the sneutrino .",
    "we illustrate the contours for _ a _ )  a low value of @xmath42 and _ b _ )   a high value of @xmath43 .",
    "also shown is the contour of @xmath44  gev which is roughly its lower mass limit   is below the current lep bound especially for the @xmath42 case , as we have already mentioned . ] from lep experiments @xcite .",
    "the selectrons are heavier than 100  gev throughout both planes .",
    "the dark shaded region in frame _ b _ ) is excluded because @xmath45 , while the light shaded region is disfavoured because @xmath46 .",
    "the branching ratio falls off to below 1% for large values of @xmath47 because the decay @xmath48 becomes dominant .",
    "we see that case  ii which has a branching fraction of 9.7% for this cascade decay chain is very typical as long as the two body decay of the chargino into the lighter stau is kinematically forbidden .",
    "case  i , while not atypical , has the corresponding branching fraction towards the lower end of its range within this framework .",
    "longitudinal electron beam polarization is very effective in removing both sm background as well as susy contamination @xcite .",
    "polarization of the positron beam would also help ( if it is achieved without significant loss of luminosity ) because the signal cross section increases , but since the availability of polarized positron beams appears less certain , we perform the bulk of our analysis for unpolarized positron beams . to identify potential sources of susy contamination and also to show how these might be reduced ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : csections ] the production cross sections for the most important susy processes as a function of the electron beam polarization parameter @xmath49 , where @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) is the fraction of left handed ( right handed ) electrons in the beam .",
    "these have been obtained using isajet v7.51 @xcite .",
    "the two frames respectively show the cross sections for ( _ a _ ) case  i , and ( _ b _ )  case  ii introduced in the previous section . except for @xmath52 production which has a negligible cross section ,",
    "the cross section for smuon pair production is close to that for the corresponding third generation sparticle production with @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) replacing @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the obvious point to note is that for signals of second or third generation sneutrinos , a ( dominantly ) right handed electron beam reduces sm backgrounds from @xmath57 and @xmath58 @xcite production as well as susy contamination from the largest visible susy processes .",
    ", @xmath59 production does not contaminate the signal . ] in the rest of our analysis , we fix @xmath60 .",
    "to get some idea of the signal rates near threshold , we show the number of @xmath61 events expected ( before any cuts ) from @xmath62 ( @xmath36 ) production ( solid ) and from @xmath63 production ( dashed ) for @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ fig : thresh]_a_. for brevity , we show this only for case i but the results for case ii are qualitatively similar .",
    "the higher sneutrino production cross section in case i is partly compensated by the fact that the branching ratio for the particular cascade decay chain is correspondingly smaller .",
    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , we assume an integrated luminosity of 10  fb@xmath2 for each value of @xmath65 , and take the scan to extend to about 10  gev above the threshold . as discussed previously , the susy contamination exemplified by the dashed curve is tiny ( the threshold for @xmath66 production is beyond the range in the figure ) , and the signal rates high enough to imagine carrying out a measurement of @xmath5 via a threshold scan as suggested in ref.@xcite . production leads to events with a @xmath67 rather than @xmath17 and so serves to contaminate the signal only if the @xmath67 decays leptonically , so that this background is below the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : thresh]_a_. moreover , with efficient vertex detection this may be reduced even further . ]",
    "a potential difficulty with this strategy is discussed shortly .    in fig .  [",
    "fig : thresh]_b _ we show the corresponding expectations for the @xmath68 channel , the favoured final state from tau sneutrino pair production .",
    "the @xmath24 signal cross section is shown as the dotted curve , while the solid and dashed curves denote contamination from electron and muon sneutrinos , respectively .",
    "notice that we have flipped the electron beam polarization .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "[ fig : csections ] that while there is slight reduction of the @xmath24 signal due to the polarization , the contamination from @xmath33 production is greatly reduced . for @xmath64 , we have checked that the contamination from @xmath22 pairs is an order of magnitude larger than the stau signal ! but",
    "at a cost of a factor 2 in the already tiny signal . ] the most striking feature of the figure is that even before experimental cuts and efficiencies are included , the signal yields just a fraction of an event throughout the range of the scan .",
    "the availability of positron polarization increases the cross section ; for @xmath69 ( corresponding to a positron beam with a dominantly singlet component ) , the rate is higher by about 30 - 40% , but clearly this is still insufficient for our purpose .",
    "furthermore , even in this `` clean '' channel contamination from other sneutrinos is very significant , and this contamination will be present in all susy models where the different flavours of sneutrinos are approximately degenerate . or",
    "@xmath23 pair production , the taus dominantly come from decays of @xmath31 produced via @xmath70 , so that @xmath71 .",
    "it may , therefore , be possible to find cuts to select out @xmath24 events over @xmath22 or @xmath23 events at some cost to the signal . however , since the signal is so tiny , it did not make sense to explore this any further .",
    "] finally , we remark that although we have not shown this explicitly , very similar considerations will apply to the @xmath72 signal from @xmath73 production .",
    "we conclude that given the current projections for the luminosity of a lc , the threshold scan does not seem to be a viable way for precision measurement of second and third generation sneutrino masses , primarily because the cross section in the relatively clean channel is too small .",
    "although our discussion up to now makes it appear that it should be possible to determine @xmath5 rather precisely via a threshold scan , there is one potential difficulty that could significantly degrade the precision from naive expectations  @xcite .",
    "this arises because the cross section for any particular final state depends on the sneutrino mass as well as the _ a priori _ unknown branching fraction for the cascade of decays into the channel being examined .",
    "this is not an issue for the lightest visible susy particle which always decays directly to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , but is important for heavier sparticles which are the focus of our analysis .",
    "we have checked that if we have measurements only near the threshold , the freedom of the overall normalization greatly degrades the precision , because the change in the cross section due to a slightly different mass can be compensated for by a small change in the branching fraction .",
    "for instance , for case  i with @xmath74  gev , even at @xmath75  gev ( which is quite far from threshold ) , the cross section changes by @xmath76% if the @xmath77 is taken to be just 1  gev larger than its reference value .",
    "thus an observed event level could be equally well fitted by the nominal mass and branching fraction into the channel in question , or by a mass that is 1  gev heavier and a branching ratio that is 4.6% rather than 4.4% .",
    "thus , _ without precise knowledge of the branching ratio , a determination of sneutrino masses at the part per mille or even the subpercent level via a threshold scan seems impossible , at least if backgrounds restrict us to particular final states .",
    "_ this state of affairs can be ameliorated by a measurement of the event rate sufficiently far from threshold . here",
    ", we assume the lc will first operate at @xmath78 gev , and that the sneutrino threshold does not accidently lie too close to this .",
    "a measurement of the event rate in the continuum is much less sensitive to @xmath79 but strongly constrains the branching fraction .",
    "the optimal strategy , therefore , involves measurements in the continuum together with measurements closer to the threshold .",
    "a related ( though possibly less severe ) problem with the claims of very precise determination of masses using the counting experiment strategy is that the production cross section depends on other sparticle masses ( _ e.g. _ of charginos in the case of @xmath33 production or neutralinos in the case of selectron production ) .",
    "any uncertainty in these will be reflected in the corresponding uncertainty in the extraction of the selectron / sneutrino mass . for second and third generation sneutrinos",
    "this is academic as we will see that their masses can not be extracted with subpercent precision , and further , that the uncertainty due to the unknown branching fraction is far bigger .",
    "for the extraction of the mass of @xmath80 though ( where there is no branching fraction uncertainty ) @xcite , and potentially also for the much better determined @xmath5 , this could be a factor .    before closing",
    ", we should mention that the uncertainty from the unknown branching fraction has not been factored into earlier analyses@xcite of masses of sparticles that cascade decay to the lsp , so that the precision may also have been over - estimated in these studies .",
    "we may expect that this is a less important factor in these studies since the end points of the energy distributions are determined by just the kinematics of the decay , and are independent of the precise branching fraction for the decay chain .",
    "the considerations of the previous section make it clear that for rate limited final states such as @xmath81 or @xmath82 the strategy suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , _ viz .",
    "_ measuring the cross section at ten points spaced 1  gev apart starting just above the threshold , is not feasible .",
    "first , the smallness of the cross section necessitates that the available integrated luminosity be distributed over fewer points , and second , we must have a measurement of the cross section far above threshold .",
    "the goal of this section is to study how a given integrated luminosity ( which we take to be 120  fb@xmath2 ) ought to be distributed to optimize the extraction of the sneutrino mass .",
    "since our purpose here is only to develop a suitable strategy , for now , we assume the ideal case of 100% detection efficiency and geometric coverage for the detector and ignore backgrounds from sm or other susy sources .",
    "our considerations will thus apply equally well to @xmath24 and @xmath23 since the production rates and decay patterns are virtually identical for the small value of @xmath83 used in the analysis . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , where we apply this strategy , the effects of cuts , detection efficiencies and backgrounds will be included .",
    "the energy and sneutrino mass dependence of the cross section for @xmath84 can be written as , @xmath85 where the normalization @xmath86 includes the products of branching fraction for decays to the @xmath68 final state .",
    "we assume that the available integrated luminosity @xmath87 is divided up as @xmath88  fb@xmath2 , where @xmath89 is the integrated luminosity at the nominal machine energy @xmath90 which we take to be 500  gev , and @xmath91 the integrated luminosity divided up between @xmath92 lower energy points between the threshold and @xmath90 .",
    "we assume that these points are equally spaced starting at an energy @xmath93 above the production threshold , and parametrize their locations by , @xmath94 our problem then is to choose @xmath95 and @xmath92 so as to optimize the mass determination .    choosing @xmath93 as small as possible seems to be intuitively optimal as long as the event rate is sufficiently large . in our analysis",
    ", we require that there be at least 10 events at each point .",
    "( @xmath96 ) events . ]",
    "this severely restricts @xmath93 , because going too close to the threshold results in a smaller number of events .",
    "we then distribute the luminosity @xmath91 over the @xmath92 points so that we expect about the _ same number of events at each of these points_. this ensures that the cross sections at each energy are measured with similar precision , but requires that more of the luminosity is spent close to threshold relative to higher energies .",
    "we then proceed as follows . for a particular choice of @xmath97 and @xmath92",
    ", we generate a set of monte carlo data for model parameters corresponding to case  i so that for each value of @xmath98 the number of events in the `` data '' is a gaussian fluctuation about its theoretical expectation .",
    "next , we fit this `` data '' to the theory ( [ theory ] ) , varying the sneutrino mass and the branching ratio @xmath99 ( implicitly contained in the parameter @xmath86 ) into the @xmath68 final state , and obtain the best fits to these two quantities by minimizing @xmath100 .",
    "the best fit values of @xmath77 and @xmath99 do not , of course , coincide with their `` input values '' .",
    "finally , we compute @xmath101 for different theories with slightly different values of @xmath77 and @xmath99 , and obtain the contour with @xmath102=4.61 which yields the 90% cl limits on how well these parameters might be determined experimentally for the chosen values of @xmath103 and @xmath92 . the procedure is then repeated to optimize this choice .    we found that choosing @xmath92 to be too large was far from optimal because the event rate is small . the choice @xmath104 as in ref .",
    "@xcite resulted in a very poor determination of the mass parameter .",
    "the best results were obtained for @xmath105 .",
    "an illustrative example of our results is shown in fig .",

    "the total integrated luminosity has been taken to be 120  fb@xmath2 .",

    "_ a _ ) where @xmath89= 60  fb@xmath2 the 10 event requirement does not allow us to sample closer than 45  gev from the threshold , resulting in a degraded mass measurement .",
    "the results in frame _ d _ ) confirm our earlier discussion : without a measurement in the continuum to constrain the branching fraction , the mass can not be well determined .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse ] , we had arbitrarily fixed @xmath107  gev , a rather small value to simulate an energy scan `` close '' to threshold .",
    "the results of an analysis with variable @xmath114 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] . here ,",
    "we have fixed @xmath106 , @xmath89 = 20  fb@xmath2 and taken _ a _ )  @xmath115  gev with @xmath116  gev , _ b _ )  @xmath117 with @xmath118  gev , _ c _ )  @xmath119  gev with @xmath118  gev , and _ d _ )  @xmath120 with @xmath121  gev .",
    "we see that the precision on the mass is considerably improved relative to fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse ] .",
    "this is mostly because for the larger values of @xmath114 in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] , we can go closer to the threshold because the cross sections at all but the lowest energy point are considerably bigger , so that less luminosity is needed to achieve the 10 event level at these intermediate points .",
    "morover , we see that frames _ c _ ) and _ d _ ) show a comparable precision on the sneutrino mass so that the precise value of @xmath114 is unimportant as long as it is sufficiently large .",
    "an important conclusion is that _ in a rate limited channel , even allowing a measurement in the continuum , an energy scan close to the threshold does not seem to be the optimal strategy for determining the sneutrino mass .",
    "_    we have examined several choices of @xmath95 and @xmath92 to optimize the strategy for extracting the sneutrino mass .",
    "we summarize our findings here . for a good mass measurement :    1 .",
    "it is necessary to go as close to the threshold as possible consistent with the minimum event level .",
    "this requires more integrated luminosity at the lower energy point where the cross section is the smallest .",
    "it is necessary to have a reasonable cross section measurement well above threshold to constrain the branching fraction .",
    "this comes `` for free '' because presumably the collider will first run at the nominal energy which we have taken to be 500  gev .",
    "we found that out of a total integrated luminosity of 120  fb@xmath2 , having about 20  fb@xmath2 at @xmath78  gev was optimal .",
    "in addition to the lowest energy point and the continuum point , just one or two additional points are needed to get the mass .",
    "having too many points requires the total luminosity to be divided too much resulting in a loss of precision .",
    "the precise interval between the points scanned is not very important .",
    "it is important , however , that the interval be large enough so that these points are not all concentrated very close to threshold where the cross section is small , and one does not obtain any measurement sufficiently close to the threshold .    .    in our study , the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta]_c _ and _ d _ yield about the best measurement of the sneutrino mass .",
    "we thus conclude that with an ideal detector and no background , as well as no initial state radiation , beam energy spread or beam - beam interaction effects , the tau sneutrino mass can be determined at about the @xmath122% level with an integrated luminosity of 120  fb@xmath2 , unless the branching fraction for the decay cascade can independently be determined from other measurements . to 1",
    "would allow a better measurement since @xmath93 could be chosen to be smaller still . while this may be true ,",
    "this is not really possible in practice since one would have to know the position of the threshold quite precisely to reduce @xmath93 significantly . ] even under these idealized circumstances , our conclusions about the precision on the mass that can be attained are considerably more pessimistic than those in ref .",
    "we see , however , that the energy scan also fixes the branching fraction for the decay to the particular final state to be between 3 - 6% .",
    "it is worth remarking that the branching fraction is slightly better constrained if @xmath89 is chosen to be larger , as for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ellipse]_a_. before closing this discussion , we should mention that we have ignored effects of the sneutrino widths in our analysis . since @xmath123 is typically a fraction of a gev , while the smallest value of @xmath93 is larger than 15  gev , non - zero width effects @xcite are completely negligible .",
    "in this section we use the energy scan strategy devised in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] to investigate the precision with which the tau and muon sneutrino masses might be measured in lc experiments once effects of finite detector acceptances , experimental cuts , sm backgrounds , susy contamination , and finally , beam energy smearing due to initial state radiation ( isr ) and beamstrahlung are incorporated .",
    "the main effect of beamstrahlung and isr is to reduce the energy in the electron / positron beams due to emission of photons , thereby reducing the available centre of mass energy in the @xmath0 collision .",
    "since our strategy entails a measurement of the event rate as close to threshold as possible , and the cross section varies rapidly with energy near the threshold , these effects are especially important .",
    "we include these effects following the suggestions in ref .",
    "for isr , we use the structure function approximation suggested by skrzypek and jadach @xcite .",

    ", we then immediately lose a factor 4/9 relative to the corresponding signal for muon sneutrinos . since the signal in this channel is already small , it is worthwhile to seriously consider any possibility for more efficient @xmath67 identification .",

    "[ sec1 ] , we will optimistically assume that _ all _ leptonically decaying taus ( where the secondary leptons satisfy @xmath150 and geometric cuts of the previous subsection ) are tagged .",
    "`` tau jets '' would also have a displaced vertex , but this is also true of heavy flavour jets .",

    "we assume that the efficiency changes slowly over the range of sneutrino masses in our scan , and take it to be a constant .",
    "this procedure allows us to scan the signal in the @xmath173 plane with just one signal simulation for each of the two cases .",

    "the efficiency varies between about 10 - 20% .",
    "one might think that the main reason for this low efficiency is due to inefficient tau detection , but this is not entirely the case .",
    "requiring five objects inside the detector acceptance together with @xmath174  gev already reduces the efficiency to 25 - 30% ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mueff ] below ) .",
    "the additional reduction is indeed due to differences in tau and muon detectability .",
    "the efficiency is significantly smaller in case  i , presumably because the mass difference @xmath175 is considerably smaller , resulting in somewhat softer taus than in case  ii .",
    "the turnover for larger values of @xmath65 in case  i is probably due to the fact that sneutrinos are boosted so that their decay products tend to emerge closer in space , and so find it harder to pass the isolation requirements .    in fig .",

    "the reason for separating out the contamination in this manner is that these relative contributions will be model and parameter dependent . in most models",

    "this asymmetry is extreme . while it may be somewhat surprising at first",
    ", the asymmetric error ellipse is readily understandable .",
    "the point is that if we try to fit the `` data '' with too high a sneutrino mass , a bad fit is obtained because some of the data points are quite close to the threshold for this fitted mass , resulting in a large @xmath100 and a bad fit . on the other hand ,",
    "if we attempt to fit with too small a sneutrino mass , the data are much more in the `` continuum region '' for this value of the sneutrino mass , and there is no data point near the threshold for this mass , so that the fit is not as poor , resulting in an asymmetric ellipse .",
    "this argument suggests that no matter how much the integrated luminosity is , there will be a ( usually disjoint ) region with a small @xmath79 and a small branching ratio to compensate the cross section , where the counting experiment alone gives a `` good fit '' to the data .",
    "this would not be a problem if the sneutrino mass in this region is smaller than @xmath190 which will be measured @xcite to 1 - 2% precision by other techniques : sneutrinos with a mass below @xmath12 clearly can not give the signal we are considering .",
    "our examination of case  i is an extreme case of this phenomenon .",
    "the small signal cross section has caused the lower region to merge with the original `` ellipse '' , but it is not meaningful to think that the sneutrino mass can be smaller than @xmath191  gev .",
    "* we see that the inclusion of the background indeed reduces the precision with which the mass and the branching ratio can be determined . for the reason just discussed ,",
    "the background increases the error in the mass more toward the lower end than the upper .",
    "* we should keep in mind that we have examined just two cases . while the sm background is negligible , the susy contamination will be model dependent as noted above .",
    "moreover , once the data sample is in hand , a detailed examination of the events may make it possible to reduce the contamination from charginos and neutralinos and possibly also from the first two generations of sneutrinos and sleptons since in these cases the taus are produced from chargino and neutralino decays , while in the signal they result from the primary decay of the produced sparticle .",
    "it seems fair , therefore , to say that the precision that might be attained is somewhere between the dashed and solid contours . * in obtaining the error ellipses , we have taken the susy contamination to depend only on the energy ; _ i.e. _ we compute this for the input parameters of the model , and assume that it does not change as we scan the @xmath173 plane .",
    "this is , of course , not true in a particular framework such as msugra or gauge - mediated susy breaking where all sparticle masses and couplings are determined by just a few parameters . in these cases ,",
    "the data would be used to determine these underlying parameters which would then be used to fix for instance @xmath4 . indeed in particular frameworks",
    ", it is entirely possible that the tau sneutrino mass may be much better measured than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauellipse ] , since data from @xmath33 production , which has a two order of magnitude larger cross section , can be used to constrain even @xmath4 .",
    "another way of saying this is that we treat the susy contamination as though we are in the mssm , and ( for the purpose of analyzing measurements of @xmath4 ) we keep all other sparticle masses fixed .",

    "the additional points were at relatively high energy where the integrated luminosity for six events was not very large .",
    "* the dotted contour shows how the solid contour in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauellipse ] would shrink if we increase both @xmath89 and @xmath91 by 50% .",

    "the total susy contamination is shown as the dashed curve . except for the fact that the cross sections are higher than in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauback ] by a factor 2 - 3 , the two figures are qualitatively very similar .",

    "this is presumably because the larger cross section results in a higher statistical significance of the signal . as in fig",
    "[ fig : tauellipse ] , the mass error is asymmetric , but the ellipse is much less skewed primarily because of the higher event rate .",

    "although an analysis of how well the electron sneutrino mass can be determined is not the main purpose of this paper , it is a natural extension of the present work .",
    "we should state at outset that our study of this is mainly to give the reader an idea of how much the issues raised above , which were very important for the second and third generation sneutrinos , impact on the determination of @xmath5 . in this case , we do not mean to imply that our study is optimized : indeed in the next section , we will suggest some ways by which the precision may be improved .    for a study of the electron sneutrino , it is clear from fig .",

    "what is , however , not clear is whether this will continue to be true close to the electron sneutrino production threshold where the signal becomes small . since neither sm backgrounds nor the production of lighter charginos or neutralinos is kinematically suppressed at @xmath201 , at least some of the channels are likely to be contaminated from these sources .",
    "in keeping with the analyses for second and third generation sneutrino masses we will , therefore , first focus on the @xmath202 channel which does not suffer from these backgrounds@xcite , and defer the question of inclusion of other channels to the next section .",
    "there are two questions concerning the strategy for determining @xmath5 that we attempt to answer here . except for the point at @xmath78  gev that is essential to constrain the branching ratio ,",
    "is it better to scan several points near the threshold , or is it better that these points be significantly spaced ( large @xmath114 ) so that we do not spend most of the luminosity where the signal is small ?",
    "second , is it better to divide the luminosity equally between the low energy points , or is it best to apportion the luminosity so that we have about an equal number of events for each energy point ?    to answer these",
    ", we have analysed four distinct strategies for the determination of @xmath5 . as before , we have first obtained @xmath203 corrected for beamstrahlung and isr as before , and then multiplied it by an efficiency function which differs somewhat from that for smuon neutrinos because of the @xmath21-channel contribution for @xmath33 production .",
    "we assume there are no sm or susy backgrounds to the signal , and require at least six signal events at any energy point . and @xmath24 signals , this restricted how close we could go to the threshold . in this case , this is not so for 500  fb@xmath2 of integrated luminosity .",
    "however , to be able to be very close to the threshold , we already need to have a good idea about @xmath5 . in our analysis",
    "we have conservatively assumed that @xmath204  gev , which should be quite feasible since measurements in the continuum will already pin @xmath5 with a precision of about 1% @xcite .",
    "this also ensures that our neglect of sneutrino widths does not cause too large an error . ]    our results for the 90% cl ( @xmath205 ) error ellipses in the @xmath206 plane are shown in fig .",

    "we perform this analysis first by dividing @xmath91 so that there are an equal number of events for each of the three points ( first row ) , and also equally amongst the three low energy points .",

    "@xmath207  gev yields a more precise determination of @xmath5 than @xmath208  gev , especially in row 2 , where the luminosity is equally divided between the points .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that it is important to get a good determination of the cross section close to the threshold . in the first row ,",
    "the difference between the dotted and solid ellipses is small , because most of the luminosity is already spent at the threshold where the cross section is much smaller .",

    "we thus conclude that unless other channels can be included , the sneutrino mass may be determined with a precision of @xmath210% , the exact value depending on the branching fraction with an integrated luminosity of 120  fb@xmath2 . the precision will about double if an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath2 is available .",

    "up to now , we have confined our analysis to just the @xmath68 channel for @xmath24 , and the analogous @xmath72 or @xmath202 channels for the other sneutrinos .",
    "we remind the reader that for the first channel , the lepton @xmath146 is defined to be an electron or muon not coming from the decay of a @xmath67 .",
    "we saw that the precision attained is very sensitive to how close we are able to go to the particle threshold where the signal becomes very small .",
    "it is natural to ask whether we can indeed go closer to the threshold by including other channels , and thereby improve the precision .",
    "clearly , we want to confine ourselves to channels with multiple jets and leptons for which the signal is not obviously overwhelmed by sm backgrounds or by contamination from other susy sources .",
    "we therefore do not consider direct decays of @xmath24 to @xmath222 since we then have final states with fewer jets / leptons , and hence sm backgrounds and susy contamination much larger than the signal . for @xmath164 production , the decay chains that we are left with consist of , @xmath223 where we have omitted invisible decays of @xmath31 for the same reason .",
    "muon or electron sneutrino production leads to analogous decay chains that we do not list here .",
    "channels 810 are strongly contaminated by @xmath33 and @xmath73 pair production and also by the production of lighter charginos and neutralinos , so it seems pointless to consider these any further .",
    "we have used isajet to compute the cross sections after all cuts and beamstrahlung / isr corrections in channels 17 for both the cases that we have examined .",
    "the contributions to each of these channels from the main susy sources , along with our estimates of the main @xmath176 sm backgrounds production which has a cross section of 4.8  fb is a potential background for some of the event topologies .",
    "we do not list its contribution here as we have not simulated these events .",
    "we expect though that this contribution is either negligible ( as for the @xmath68 channel ) , substantially smaller than other backgrounds listed ( as for the @xmath224 channel ) , or easily removeable ( as for the @xmath225 channel . ) ] are shown in table [ tab : tauback ] for @xmath78  gev .",
    "we list separately the contributions from @xmath164 production , from the production of the first two generations of sneutrinos and sleptons , from @xmath226 production ( which we separate out because in models with large @xmath83 this can have a threshold that is quite different from the threshold for other sleptons and sneutrinos ) and , finally , from the production of chargino and neutralino pairs .",
    "there are two entries for the susy contributions ; the first is for case  i , while the second one ( in parenthesis ) is for case  ii .",
    "we see that channels 4 and 5 have large backgrounds from @xmath227 production exceeding the signal by a factor of 29 ( 26 ) and 173 ( 67 ) for case  i ( case  ii ) , respectively .",
    "we have traced this to events where @xmath228 .",
    "this background should be reducible by an invariant mass cut on the @xmath229 system , but at some cost to the already small signal . ]",
    "while vetoing events with @xmath156 jets together with top reconstruction cuts may well reduce this background considerably , it will be at some cost to the signal which , in each channel , starts out at a level of just @xmath230  fb ( 0.29  fb ) in case  i ( case  ii ) .",
    "moreover , the contamination from sleptons and charginos / neutralinos is several times the signal that cuts designed to reconstruct the top background will not significantly reduce .",
    "channel 3 with the @xmath231 final state has a significant background from @xmath232 production , though this should be almost eliminated by an invariant mass cut on the @xmath233 system .",
    "the bigger problem is that this channel is contaminated by events from susy sources : the sleptons , charginos / neutralinos and the staus , each lead to @xmath231 cross sections that exceed the corresponding signal cross section by a factor of 68 , with @xmath234 events ( which would most resemble the signal ) contributing about 1/3 ( 2/3 ) of the susy background .    in channels 6 and 7 , although the sm contamination is small , the signal is very tiny .",
    "morover , the susy contamination from the first two generations of sneutrinos and charged sleptons exceeds the signal by a factor of 25 - 100 .",
    "this leaves us with channels 1 and 2 .",
    "the decays @xmath235 result in an unexpected source of sm background in channel 2 .",
    "the @xmath227 background , while smaller , is not insignificant . contamination from chargino / neutralino and stau production is comparable to the signal .",
    "while it may well be possible to include this channel at @xmath78  gev , the real problem with this channel comes because we need the same channels in our energy scan . for instance , at an energy 15  gev above the threshold , the @xmath236 background exceeds the signal by a factor 40 ( 15 ) for case  i ( case  ii ) , while the top background ( present only for case  ii ) exceeds the signal by a factor @xmath237 . considering all these problems together with the fact that the signal in channel 2 would add just 30 - 50% to channel 1 , we did not think that it was worth including it in our analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] .",
    "we have also examined whether it might be possible to include other signals from @xmath73 to obtain a significantly better determination of @xmath3 . toward this end , we have computed the cross section in the appropriate channels analogous to those shown in table [ tab : tauback ] , along with the sm backgrounds .",
    "our results are shown in table [ tab : muback ] for @xmath78  gev . again",
    "the entries in parenthesis refer to the cross sections in case  ii . here , in the last two rows of both the susy sources as well as the sm backgrounds , to avoid double counting ( with channels 3 and 1 ) , the @xmath146 in the case of the @xmath238 and @xmath239 channels refers only to any @xmath16 or a @xmath17 from the decay of a tau ( which , we have assumed , can be tagged by a vertex detector ) .",
    "we should mention that , in this case , for @xmath196 channel 4 would be the same as channel 9 .",
    "a similar comment applies _ vis   vis _ channels 3 and 10 .",
    "unfortunately , essentially the same reasoning as before leads us to conclude that it is not possible to improve the sneutrino mass measurement by including other channels .- veto and top reconstruction , contamination from other susy sources is still large .",
    "it may be interesting to see whether it is possible to devise cuts to reduce this background without killing the signal . ]    finally , we turn to the case of electron sneutrinos . as we noted in the last section ,",
    "the question in this case is whether we can include other channels close to the @xmath33 threshold so as to be able to cleanly extract the threshold behaviour of the signal cross section . the dominant susy contamination at an energy about 2 gev above the nominal electron sneutrino threshold which mainly comes from the production of charginos and neutralinos is shown in table [ tab : eback ] along with the @xmath22 signal in various channels .",
    "in addition , sm backgrounds from @xmath179 and @xmath20 pair production , as well as @xmath227 production ( only for case  ii ) will also be present .",
    "it should be remembered that the cross section for @xmath57 production is now very large because @xmath240 .",
    "backgrounds from @xmath227 and @xmath232 production are about 1.5 - 2 times larger for left polarized electron beams @xcite .",
    "channel 5 will have a large background from @xmath57 production ( see table [ tab : muback ] ) .",
    "for case  ii only , @xmath227 production will be a formidable sm background in channels 4 and 5 . in channels 6 and 7",
    ", the signal is very small .",
    "this leaves us with channels 1 - 3 .",
    "neutralino production ( mainly @xmath241 ) contaminates channel 3 , particularly in case  ii for which it has considerable phase space even at the sneutrino threshold .",
    "it is possible , of course , that the signal from sneutrinos may be relatively enhanced by further cuts , _",
    "e.g. _ on @xmath242 or @xmath243 , but such a detailed analysis is beyond the scope of this study .",
    "finally , we remark that the signal in the remaining ( relatively background - free ) channel 2 may be combined with that in channel 1 resulting in an increase of about 40% .",
    "presumably , this will increase the precision from that shown in fig  [ fig : eellipse ] by about 20% .",
    "we should add that in favourable cases , considerably better precision might be possible .",
    "for instance , if @xmath227 production is kinematically forbidden close to the threshold ( as in case  i ) , it should be possible to combine the signal in channel 4 with those in channels 1 and 2 , resulting in a three - fold increase in the signal .",
    "optimistically , one may even assume that this may be possible even in case  ii since top reconstruction and @xmath156-veto may severely reduce the top background .",
    "nonetheless , one sees that even if we combine the signals in all the channels the signal is increased by at most a factor @xmath244 .",
    "if we further assume that both sm and susy backgrounds can be eliminated without loss of signal , this increased signal is statistically equivalent to an increase in available integrated luminosity .",
    "we conclude that even in such a favourable scenario , the precision on @xmath5 , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath245  fb@xmath2 will be comparable to that given by the inner ellipse in fig .",
    "[ fig : eellipse ] , but still much larger than the 70  mev claimed in ref . @xcite . in this case",
    "width effects , that we have neglected here , would become important for an analysis of what might be achievable with a data sample of 500  fb@xmath2 .",
    "we have performed a detailed examination of the prospects for the determination of sneutrino masses at future linear colliders via a measurement of the energy dependence of the cross section .",
    "threshold studies , which have been claimed@xcite to yield a precision better than parts per mille ( 0.5% ) with an integrated luminosity of just 100  fb@xmath2 for @xmath5 ( @xmath3 and @xmath246 ) ) , are a special case of this .",
    "we find that for the second and third generations , the sneutrino production rate leads to less than 1 event for each energy point if we adopt the energy scan strategy and luminosity proposed in ref . @xcite and restrict ourselves to the @xmath72 and @xmath68 channels that have been suggested to be relatively free of sm backgrounds and susy contamination .",
    "the availability of 80% positron beam polarization increases the signal by about 40% , but this is not sufficient .",
    "also , including other channels did not appear to help significantly , since in those channels where the signal was substantial , susy contamination is also large .    we have also identified a different issue that degrades the precision with which sneutrino masses can be determined from counting experiments , even if the signal is large .",
    "the point is that the size of the signal depends on an unknown branching fraction for sneutrinos to decay to the channel of interest . for sneutrinos ,",
    "this is a problem of principle because even if backgrounds are small and even with a perfect detector , sneutrinos decaying via @xmath247 ( whose branching fraction can be anything up to 100% ) always escape detection .",
    "we emphasize that although we are discussing this only in the context of sneutrinos , this issue arises even for charged sparticle mass measurements ( except , possibly , for the lightest charged particle as it can only decay to the lsp ) in realistic detectors : although sm backgrounds are generally greatly reduced by suitable cuts , to eliminate susy contamination , one is frequently forced to study the signal in specific channels whose branching fraction is again to be determined using the same data that is used to extract the mass .",
    "thus , the sparticle mass and this branching fraction have to be simultaneously extracted by fitting both these to the same data .",
    "this considerably degrades the precision with which the mass can be determined .",
    "while this is , in principle , also a problem for the extraction of masses using kinematic strategies @xcite , the sensitivity to the unknown branching fraction is presumably smaller .    for sparticles",
    "whose cross sections into channels where susy contamination and sm backgrounds are under control is relatively small , we found that the following offers a reasonable strategy for extracting their mass :    * use about 15 - 20% of the available integrated luminosity at the nominal collider energy which , we assume is well beyond the sneutrino production threshold . in our analysis , we took this to be 500  gev .",
    "a measurement of the cross section at this energy strongly constrains the branching fraction . *",
    "divide the remaining integrated luminosity to measure the cross section at about three additional lower energy points in such a manner so as to obtain about an equal number of events at each point so that the fractional error in the cross section at each energy is about the same .",
    "since the precision on the mass improves if we are able to go close to the threshold where the cross section is small and a large integrated luminosity is required to get a fixed number of events , we found that it was best to space these points @xmath248  gev apart .",
    "this is because two of the three points are away from the threshold and so can reach the target number of events with a modest integrated luminosity .",
    "specifically , for muon and tau type sneutrinos , the availability of right - handed electron beams was essential to reduce the contamination from electron sneutrinos and chargino production .",
    "we made several optimistic assumptions for our analysis .",
    "first , we assumed that 95% electron beam polarization will be available .",
    "second , for the determination of @xmath4 , we assumed that vertex detection would allow leptonically decaying taus to be tagged with an efficiency close to 100% . while this would also allow hadronically decaying taus to be discriminated from light quark and gluon jets , the need to discriminate tau jets from @xmath153-jets required us to impose requirements on hadronically decaying taus that reduce their efficiency , but maintain the purity of the tau sample .",
    "we should , however , remind the reader that we have used the beamstrahlung spectrum appropriate to @xmath78  gev all the way down to the sneutrino mass threshold .",
    "this will cause us to somewhat underestimate the precision that might be attained .",
    "even so , we found that an integrated luminosity of 100  fb@xmath2 was too small for a measurement of @xmath4 .",
    "this is because we were forced to confine our analysis to the cleanest @xmath68 channel .",
    "other channels either had small cross sections or suffered from considerable susy backgrounds .",
    "a crude determination of @xmath3 may be possible allows the reader to assess how small @xmath93 can be to maintain the six event minimum as we have required .",
    "] at least in case  ii even with an integrated luminosity of @xmath249  fb@xmath2 , but since @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be determined via essentially the same collider runs , we have assumed an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath2 for both analyses .",
    "even then , we found that , at best , a measurement of these masses with a precision of several percent ( at 90% cl ) is possible , with of course @xmath3 being @xmath250 times better determined than @xmath4 .",
    "the exact precision that can be attained depends on the branching fraction into the useful channels which can vary by a factor @xmath250 for representative ranges of susy parameters .",
    "the attainable precision will also depend to some extent on how well susy backgrounds may be controlled . the main results of our studies are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tauellipse ] for @xmath24 and fig .",
    "[ fig : muellipse ] for @xmath251 , and summarized in table  [ tab : summary ] .",
    "we emphasize again that these results are for a model - independent analysis . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec4]c , analyses within particular frameworks such as msugra may yield much higher precision .",
    "it also seems worthwhile to stress that unlike a closely spaced threshold scan the strategy of taking data at widely spaced intervals would conceivably be useful for other physics , than just sneutrino masses .",
    "for instance , the same energy scan could be used to simultaneously obtain masses of several sparticles or even make measurements useful for higgs boson , top as well as electroweak or qcd studies .",
    "we also examined prospects for determining @xmath5 . for this , of course , left - handed electron polarization is optimal .",
    "again , it appeared to be best to use about 20% of the available luminosity at the nominal energy , and divide the remainder among about three points at lower energies with equal number of events at each point .",
    "in contrast to the second and third generation cases , it seemed best to choose the points just about 1  gev apart , though the precision for a 30  gev spacing is not much worse as can be seen in the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig : eellipse ] . indeed",
    "the consideration in the previous paragraph may suggest that this may be better for the overall physics program at the lc .",
    "the reader should keep in mind that even with this strategy most of the data will be at the one point closest to the threshold . with an integrated luminosity of 120  fb@xmath2",
    ", a precision of about 0.5% ( 90% cl ) appears to be possible .",
    "this will improve by a factor 2 for a data sample of 500  fb@xmath2 . in this case",
    ", some improvement may be possible by combining several channels .",
    "the dotted ellipses in the second row show that the precision on @xmath5 will be degraded by about 25 - 30% if , in the interest of the overall lc program , it is decided to collect equal amounts of integrated luminosity at points spaced 30  gev apart .    to conclude , we reiterate that experiments at the lc will be able to determine masses of sneutrinos with significant precision but certainly for the third generation , and possibly also second generation , sneutrino mass determination an integrated luminosity @xmath252  fb@xmath2 seems essential",
    ". however , even with this large luminosity , the precision claimed in ref.@xcite does not seem possible .",
    "while we have not checked this , the mass resolution for the heavier charged sleptons @xmath56 and @xmath54 is presumably not any better than that for the corresponding sneutrinos .",
    "the masses of first generation sneutrinos can be determined with much greater precision , but even in this case , our projections for the precision are nowhere near as optimistic as those in ref . @xcite .",
    "we caution that several beautiful analyses @xcite about what might be attainable in light of measurements at a lc might be painting too rosy a picture .",

    "<S> we propose a different strategy to optimize the extraction of @xmath3 and @xmath4 via the energy dependence of the cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we find that even with an integrated luminosity of 500  fb@xmath2 , these can be determined with a precision no better than several percent at the 90% cl . </S>",
    "<S> we also examine the measurement of @xmath5 and show that it can be extracted with a precision of about 0.5% ( 0.2% ) with an integrated luminosity of 120  fb@xmath2 ( 500  fb@xmath2 ) . </S>"
