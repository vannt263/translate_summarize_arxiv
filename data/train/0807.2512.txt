    "it is implicitely assumed that the independent degrees of freedom of any mechanical system satisfy , in general , second order differential equations , as it happens for the newton equations of the centre of mass of the mechanical system .",
    "this is reflected in the general assumption that the lagrangian of any mechanical system is an explicit function @xmath0 of the time @xmath1 , the @xmath2 degrees of freedom @xmath3 and their time derivatives @xmath4 .",
    "lagrangians depending on higher order derivatives are scarcely used , and their usefulness is left to some especific problems . in this work",
    "we are going to give three different kinds of arguments to justify the use of lagrangians depending up to the acceleration of the centre of charge for describing charged elementary spinning particles .",
    "the centre of charge of an elementary particle thus satisfies fourth order differential equations .    in section [ rigid ]",
    "we analyze the motion of the centre of charge of a charged rigid body , considered as a model of a classical elementary particle . in section [ invariance ] we suggest that the order of the invariant differential equation satisfied by the evolution of a point depends on the number of parameters of the kinematical group of the theory . since the galilei and poincar groups are ten - parameter groups , and if the point represents the position of the centre of charge of an elementary particle , the corresponding differential equation must be of fourth order .",
    "section [ geometrical ] analyzes the most general differential equation satisfied by a point in three dimensional space , which is of fourth order .",
    "finally , section [ dirac ] describes the model of a dirac particle obtained from a general formalism for describing classical spinning particles and compares its structure with the previous predicted motions .",
    "let us consider that an elementary particle is described as a nonrelativistic rigid body .",
    "a rigid body is a mechanical system of six degrees of freedom .",
    "three represent the position of a point and the other three the orientation of a body frame attached to that point .",
    "usually , it is described by the location of the centre of mass , which is represented by the point @xmath5 , and the orientation by the principal axis of inertia located around @xmath5 .",
    "the centre of mass satisfies second order dynamical equations and moves like a point of mass @xmath6 , the total mass of the system , under the total external force .",
    "the torques of the external forces produce a change in the orientation of the body . in this way a rigid body moves and rotates .     and and another arbitrary point @xmath7 of a rigid body.,width=264 ]",
    "if we describe the evolution of a different point @xmath7 , it will follow , in general , a helical trajectory around the centre of mass , like the one depicted in the figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "if an elementary particle is a charged rigid body , it is clear that we also need to know its electromagnetic structure , which can be reduced to the knowledge of the centre of charge and the different multipoles .",
    "if assumed some spherical symmetry for the electric field produced by the particle , we are left with the location of the centre of charge and no further multipoles .",
    "the position of this point will be used to determine there the actions of the external fields and to compute from there the fields generated by the particle . in general , depending how the mass and charge are distributed , these two points will be different points as we shall assume here .",
    "therefore , if we try to describe the evolution of the centre of mass , we have to determine also at any time the location of the centre of charge to compute the external forces .",
    "dynamical equations for the centre of mass will be written as @xmath8 the electromagnetic force @xmath9 depends , in general , on the electric and magnetic external fields defined at the charge position @xmath7 and on the velocity of the charge @xmath10 which appears in the magnetic term .    the relative motion between @xmath7 and @xmath5 when analyzed by an observer who sees the centre of mass at rest like in figure [ fig:2 ] is a circular motion with constant velocity , in particular in the free case .     around the centre of mass at rest @xmath5 .",
    ", width=264 ]    if we define a unit vector @xmath11 in the direction of the normal acceleration @xmath12 of point @xmath7 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the radius of the circular motion , then , the centre of mass position can be written as @xmath15 for the centre of mass observer , the angular velocity is also orthogonal to the plane subtended by the velocity @xmath16 and acceleration @xmath17 of point @xmath7 , and given by @xmath18 in this way , we have also solved the problem of the rotation of the charged rigid body by analyzing the evolution of just the centre of charge .    therefore , it will be simpler , from a theoretical point of view , just to describe the evolution of a single point , the centre of charge @xmath7 , instead of the orientation of the rigid body and its centre of mass @xmath5 , which will be in some average position of point @xmath7 , and obtained from ( [ eq : q ] ) once the trajectory of @xmath7 is computed . the elimination of the @xmath19 among equations ( [ eq : cm ] ) and ( [ eq : q ] ) will give us , in general , a fourth order differential equation for the variable @xmath7 .",
    "if the rigid body is no longer free , we shall assume that its stiffness means that the relationship between @xmath5 , @xmath20 and @xmath7 and their derivatives given in ( [ eq : q ] ) and ( [ eq : w ] ) still remain valid , even in the presence of an external interaction .",
    "therefore , if the centre of mass and centre of charge of a rigid body are different points , it is sufficient to describe the evolution of the centre of charge . then , the rigid body is reduced to a system of only three degrees of freedom which satisfy fourth - order differential equations .",
    "we see that a lagrangian depending on the acceleration of point @xmath7 , could reproduce such equations .",
    "the following nonrelativistic free lagrangian @xmath21 produces the dynamical equations for the point @xmath7 @xmath22 which can be factorized in terms of a point @xmath5 , defined as in ( [ eq : q ] ) in the form @xmath23 a free motion for the point @xmath5 which can be interpreted as the centre of mass , and a harmonic motion of point @xmath7 around @xmath5 with a constant frequency @xmath24 .",
    "it is the presence of the acceleration term in the lagrangian which produces the definition of a point @xmath5 , different from @xmath7 , moving freely .",
    "this lagrangian describes a particle with spin @xcite , where its detailed analysis can be found in this reference .",
    "let us consider the trajectory @xmath25 , @xmath26 $ ] followed by a point of a mechanical system for an arbitrary inertial observer @xmath27 .",
    "any other inertial observer @xmath28 is related to the previous one by a transformation of the spacetime kinematical group such that their relative spacetime measurements of any spacetime event are given by @xmath29 where the functions @xmath30 and @xmath31 define the corresponding spacetime transformation of the kinematical group @xmath32 , of parameters @xmath33 , among any two observers .",
    "then the description of the trajectory of that point for observer @xmath28 is obtained from @xmath34.\\ ] ] if we eliminate @xmath1 as a function of @xmath35 from the first equation and substitute into the second we shall get @xmath36 since observer @xmath28 is arbitrary , equation ( [ eq : robs ] ) represents the complete set of trajectories of the point for all inertial observers .",
    "elimination of the @xmath37 group parameters among the function @xmath38 and their time derivatives will give us the differential equation satisfied by all the trajectories of the point .",
    "let us assume that the trajectory is unrestricted in such a way that the above group parameters are essential in the sense that no smaller number of them gives the same family of trajectories .",
    "this differential equation is invariant by construction because it is independent of the group parameters and therefore independent of any inertial observer . if @xmath32 is either the galilei or poincar group , it is a ten - parameter group so that we have to work out in general up to the fourth derivative to obtain sufficient equations to eliminate the group parameters",
    ". therefore the order of the differential equation is dictated by the number of parameters and the structure of the kinematical group . if the point @xmath7 represents the position of the centre of charge of an elementary particle we get again that it satisfies , in general , a fourth order differential equation .",
    "but at the same time it is telling us that to obtain the invariant differential equation satisfied by the centre of charge of an elementary particle , it is sufficient to obtain its trajectory in an arbitrary reference frame , and to follow the above procedure of elimination of the group parameters .",
    "a continuous and differentiable curve in three - dimensional space , @xmath39 , is a regular curve if at any point @xmath40 has a tangent vector @xmath41 .",
    "it has associated three orthogonal unit vectors , @xmath42 , @xmath11 and @xmath43 , called respectively the tangent , normal and binormal . if using the arc length @xmath40 as the curve parameter , they satisfy the frenet - serret equations @xmath44 where the overdot means the derivative with respect to @xmath40 .",
    "the knowledge of the curvature @xmath45 and torsion @xmath46 , together the boundary values @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , completely determine the curve , because the above equations are integrable . in terms of the vector @xmath51 , known as darboux vector ,",
    "the frenet - serret equations can be rewritten as @xmath52 so that , in units of arc length , darboux vector represents the instantaneous angular velocity undergone by the local triad frame .    by changing the notation @xmath53 ,",
    "we have @xmath54 and this allows us to eliminate the three unit vectors @xmath42 , @xmath11 and @xmath43 , in terms of the three derivatives @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "if we replace them in the next order derivative @xmath57 , one obtains the most general differential equation satisfied by the point @xmath7 , i.e. , the fourth order differential system @xmath58    let us consider that an elementary particle , instead of being a rigid body , is just a localized mechanical system . by localized we mean that , at least , it is described by the evolution of a single point @xmath7 .",
    "this point could be the centre of mass , but , as mentioned before , in order to determine the external forces , we also need to know the location of the centre of charge to compute the actions of the external fields .",
    "let us assume that the elementary particle is charged .",
    "by the previous arguments , if its electric field is spherically symmetric , we are reduced to know the evolution just of the centre of charge .",
    "the particle will have a centre of mass but we make the assumption that the centre of mass and the centre of charge are not necessarily the same point .",
    "let us consider that the geometrical regular curve @xmath39 in three - dimensional space represents the trajectory of the centre of charge of an elementary particle .",
    "when the corresponding inertial observer uses its time as the evolution parameter , kinematics enters into the scene .",
    "let us assume now that the motion of the particle is free .",
    "this means that we can not distinguish one point of the evolution from another , so that the motion has to be at a constant velocity such that the arc length @xmath59 , where @xmath16 is the velocity of the charge , must be independent of the time @xmath1 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath60 is not the same we can distinguish one instant of the evolution from another , as far as the displacement of the charge is concerned . at the same time",
    ", darboux vector has to be also independent of time .",
    "the frenet - serret triad moves and rotates in a free motion with constant linear and angular velocities .",
    "the curvature and torsion are necessarily constants of the motion .",
    "thus @xmath61 , and , in the free case , the equations ( [ eq : masgeneral ] ) are reduced to @xmath62 if the curvature and torsion are constant the curve is a helix , which can be factorized in terms of a central point @xmath63 which is moving in a straight trajectory , while the point @xmath7 satisfies @xmath64 an isotropic harmonic motion of frequency @xmath24 , around point @xmath5 .",
    "the point @xmath5 clearly represents the centre of mass position of the free particle and its expression in terms of the centre of charge position is exactly the same as in the case for the rigid body ( [ eq : q ] ) .",
    "the centre of charge of a free elementary particle is describing a helix at a constant velocity for any inertial observer .",
    "if we make a nonrelativistic analysis , the relationship of the velocity measurements among two arbitrary inertial observers @xmath27 and @xmath28 , is given by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the constant velocity of @xmath27 as measured by @xmath28 and the constant rotation matrix @xmath14 is their relative orientation .",
    "now , @xmath67 in a relativistic analysis @xmath68 where @xmath66 is also the velocity of observer @xmath27 measured by @xmath28 and @xmath14 represents their relative orientation , and thus @xmath69 taking the time derivative of both expressions ( [ una ] ) and ( [ dos ] ) if @xmath70 has to be also constant for observer @xmath28 , we get that @xmath71 , irrespective of @xmath66 and of the rotation matrix @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the vector @xmath72 must be a constant vector .",
    "the centre of charge necessarily moves along a straight trajectory at a constant velocity , for every inertial observer , and the above general helix degenerates into a straight line and because the point is not accelerated @xmath73 .",
    "this is the usual description of the spinless or pointlike free elementary charged particle , whose centre of charge and centre of mass are represented by the same point .",
    "however , in this relativistic analysis , there is one alternative not included in the nonrelativistic approach .",
    "the possibility that the charge of an elementary particle will be moving at the speed of light and , in that case , @xmath74 , for any inertial observer .",
    "this means that the centre of the helix is always moving at a velocity @xmath75 , and , if it represents the centre of mass , this particle is a massive particle . in a variational description of this system",
    "the lagrangian should depend up to the acceleration of the point @xmath7 in order to obtain fourth order differential equations .",
    "this dependence on the acceleration will give a contribution to the spin of the particle and there is also another contribution from the rotation of the system , because the body frame rotates with angular velocity @xmath20 .",
    "the motion of the charge around the centre of mass produces the magnetic moment of the particle .    when we introduce the time as the curve parameter if the trajectory is necessarily a helix at a constant velocity @xmath76 , it is equivalent the use of the arc length @xmath77 or the time as the curve parameter .",
    "but if the curve is regular it must have at any point a tangent vector @xmath78 .",
    "this implies that the velocity of the charge can never be reached by any inertial observer .",
    "otherwise , the velocity of the charge will be zero at a certain time but different from zero for subsequent times , because the point is accelerated , which is contradictory with the requirement that the point describes a trajectory with a constant velocity .",
    "this kinematical argument requires that the kinematical group of spacetime symmetries must contain a limit velocity which can not be reached by any inertial observer . among the possible ten - dimensional kinematical groups found by bacry and levy - leblond @xcite , only the de sitter groups @xmath79 and @xmath80 and the poincar group @xmath81 contain such a limit velocity @xmath82 .",
    "if the spacetime is flat then only the poincar kinematical description is singled out by this requirement , so that the charge , necessarily , must be moving at this limit velocity .    in summary",
    ", there are only two possibilities for a free motion of the centre of charge of an elementary particle .",
    "one , the charge is moving along a straight line at any constant velocity , the centre of mass is the same point , the system has no magnetic moment and it can be described either in a relativistic or a non - relativistic framework . in the other , the particle has spin and magnetic moment , and the charge moves along a helix at the speed of light . because all known elementary particles , quarks and leptons , are spin @xmath83 particles , and the charged ones have magnetic moment , we are left only with this last possibility if we want to give a more improved description of an elementary particle . here",
    ", only the relativistic description is allowed .",
    "this is consistent with dirac s theory of the electron , because the eigenvalues of the components of dirac s velocity operator are @xmath84 .",
    "this means that dirac s spinor @xmath85 is expressed in terms of the position of the charge @xmath7 , because the external fields @xmath86 are defined and computed at this point .",
    "this last possiblity is the description of the centre of charge of a relativistic spinning elementary particle obtained in the kinematical formalism @xcite , and which satisfies dirac s equation when quantized .",
    "the classical structure of this dirac particle is analyzed in the next section .    in this formalism dirac particles",
    "are localized and also orientable mechanical systems . by orientable we mean that we have to attach to the above point @xmath7 , a local cartesian frame to describe its spatial orientation .",
    "this frame could be the frenet - serret triad .",
    "the rotation of the frame will also contribute to the total spin of the particle .",
    "when quantizing the system , the spin @xmath83 is coming from the presence of the orientation variables .",
    "otherwise , if there are no orientation variables , no spin @xmath83 structure is described when quantizing the system .",
    "this twofold structure of the classical spin has produced a pure kinematical interpretation of the gyromagnetic ratio @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the lagrangian on the acceleration is necessary for the particle to have magnetic moment and for the separation between the centre of mass and centre of charge .",
    "in the kinematical formalism @xcite , an elementary particle is , by definition , a mechanical system which in addition to being indivisible , as a consequence of the atomic hypothesis @xcite , it can never be deformed so that all allowed states are only kinematical modifications of any one of them .",
    "this means that when the state of an elementary particle changes it is possible to find an inertial observer who measures the particle in the same state as before .",
    "an electron , if not annihilated , always remains an electron under any external force .",
    "this means that in a variational approach the initial @xmath87 and final @xmath88 states of the evolution are related by a transformation of the kinematical group @xmath89 .",
    "therefore , the boundary variables of the variational approach , necessarily span a homogeneous space of the kinematical group of space - time symmetries . when quantizing all classical systems characterized by such homogeneous spaces , their hilbert space of pure states carries a projective unitary irreducible representation of the kinematical group @xcite .",
    "it thus satisfies wigner s definition of a quantum elementary particle .    in this way",
    ", the parameters of the kinematical group become the classical variables we need to consider , as the boundary values of the variational formalism for describing an elementary particle . in the relativistic and non - relativistic approach , these variables are reduced to the ten variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 , interpreted respectively as the time , position of the charge , velocity of the charge and orientation . in the relativistic case",
    "we have three disjoint , maximal homogeneous spaces of the poincar group spanned by these variables with the constraint either @xmath92 , @xmath93 or @xmath94 .",
    "it is the manifold with @xmath93 , as suggested by the kinematical arguments of the previous section , which leads to dirac s equation when quantizing the system .",
    "because the lagrangian depends on the next order derivative of the boundary variables , it thus depends also on the acceleration of the point @xmath7 and on the angular velocity .",
    "it is thus clear that the point @xmath7 can not be the centre of mass because satisfies fourth - order differential equations . because the external interaction is defined at this point @xmath7 ,",
    "is why we consider it represents the position of the charge .",
    "then , for a dirac particle , the charge located at point @xmath7 , is moving at the speed of light @xmath93 . the classical expression which gives rise to dirac",
    "s equation is @xmath95 where the energy @xmath96 is expressed as the sum of two terms , @xmath97 , or translational energy and the other , which depends on the spin of the system , or rotational energy .",
    "the spin comes from the dependence of the lagrangian @xmath98 of both , the acceleration @xmath99 , and the angular velocity @xmath100 , and if we define @xmath101 it takes the form @xmath102 the first part @xmath103 , or _ zitterbewegung _",
    "part , is related to the separation between the centre of charge from the centre of mass and takes into account this relative orbital motion .",
    "it quantizes with integer values .",
    "the second part @xmath104 is the rotational part of the body frame and quantizes with both integer and half - integer values .",
    "the total angular momentum with respect to the origin of observer s frame is @xmath105 so that the spin @xmath106 is the angular momentum of the system with respect to the centre of charge @xmath7 , and not with respect to the centre of mass @xmath5 . by this reason ,",
    "it is not a conserved quantity for a free particle , but satisfies the dynamical equation @xmath107 this is exactly the same dynamical equation satisfied by dirac s spin operator in the quantum case .",
    "this has to be taken into account when comparing the analysis of this spin with other approaches , for instance , with bargmann - michel - telegdi spin observable @xcite , which clearly represents the angular momentum with respect to the centre of mass of the system .",
    "once a mechanical system has two distinguished points , the centre of charge and centre of mass , we must clarify with respect to which of these points is defined the angular momentum of the system .",
    "this is important , for instance , in the so called _ proton spin crisis_. if the spin of the proton is the angular momentum with respect to its centre of mass , and we add the three dirac spin operators of the three quarks we can not obtain the spin of the proton .",
    "what we have to add are the three spins of the quarks with respect to their corresponding centre of mass , if assumed that the motion of the quarks is in an @xmath108 orbital angular momentum state .    when expressed dirac s spin and the centre of mass position in terms of the velocity and acceleration of the charge they take , respectively , the form @xmath109 dirac s spin is always orthogonal to the osculator plane of the trajectory of the charge @xmath7 , in the direction opposite to the binormal for a positive energy particle , and in the opposite direction for the antiparticle",
    "this implies a difference in chirality between matter and antimatter .",
    "the acceleration of the charge is pointing from @xmath7 to the centre of mass , as it corresponds to a helix .",
    "it is shown that the dynamical equation of point @xmath7 for the free particle and in the centre of mass frame is given by @xmath110 and where the spin vector @xmath106 is constant in this frame , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "the radius of the zitterbewegung motion is @xmath111 , and the angular velocity @xmath112 .",
    "when considered in the centre - of mass frame it is a system of three degrees of freedom ; two are the @xmath113 and @xmath114 components of the position of the charge on the zitterbewegung plane and the third is the phase of the rotation of the body frame .",
    "this phase is the same as the phase of the orbital motion and because the velocity @xmath93 is constant , we are just left with a single and independent degree of freedom , for instance , the @xmath113 coordinate .",
    "the dirac particle , when considered in the centre of mass frame , is equivalent to a one - dimensional harmonic oscillator of frequency @xmath24 .",
    "if we quantize this harmonic oscillator , because the centre of mass is at rest the oscillator is in its ground state of energy @xmath115 .",

    "motion of the charge of the electron in the centre of mass frame .",
    "the magnetic moment of the particle is produced by the motion of the charge .",
    "the total spin @xmath106 is half the value of the zitterbewegung part @xmath118 when quantizing the sytem , so that when expressing the magnetic moment in terms of the total spin we get a @xmath119 gyromagnetic ratio @xcite .",
