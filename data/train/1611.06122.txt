    "since 2005 , when the first edition of the present lecture course was prepared , polaron physics continued to intensely develop , involving new areas and testing new powerful methods . in subsequent editions ,",
    "these new developments are included in order to emphasize which of them we consider important .",
    "renewed interest in large ( frhlich ) polarons has been inspired by recent experimental advances in the determination of the band structure of highly polar oxides @xcite .",
    "the optical response of complex oxides clearly reveals the polaron features and can shed light on the band structure of a crystal and its polaron characteristics .",
    "the interpretation of the measured data is essential to achieve a comprehensive understanding and to optimize practical application of functional materials .",
    "in particular , the question whether the polarons are large or small is often a subject of intense discussions , for example , in the case of srtio@xmath0 and tio@xmath1 , key materials in many technological sectors .    in the recent arpes measurements @xcite",
    "no clear signatures of small - polaron phenomena in @xmath2-doped strontium titanate were found , and the conclusion was reached that small polarons are not formed in strontium titanate . the electron - phonon coupling strength in strontium titanate @xmath3 obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite is typical for a rather moderate coupling that makes the formation of small polarons in the conduction band of srtio@xmath0 hardly possible . on the contrary ,",
    "recent density functional calculations @xcite show that excess electrons form small polarons if the density of electronic carriers is sufficiently high .",
    "this opens the interesting possibility to study an interplay of small and large polarons in srtio@xmath0 and other oxides . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the many - large - polaron model gives then a convincing interpretation of the experimentally observed mid - infrared band of srti@xmath4nb@xmath5o@xmath0 .",
    "the polaron theory is a testing field for new powerful theoretical quantum field methods , such as the diagrammatic quantum monte carlo ( dqmc ) method . applied first to the calculation of the ground - state energy of a frhlich polaron @xcite",
    ", dqmc has been successful in the calculation of the optical conductivity of the frhlich polaron @xcite .",
    "this inspired attempts to develop analytical methods for the polaron optical response .",
    "the recent work on the strong - coupling large - polaron optical conductivity @xcite shows a good agreement with dqmc in the strong - coupling limit . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the momentum average approximation is applied to derive an analytic expression for the optical conductivity of a small polaron , that very well matches the dqmc data .",
    "the polaron theory has found recently several new interesting applications .",
    "one of them is the theoretical interpretation of the physics of an impurity immersed in an atomic bose - einstein condensate . in refs .",
    "@xcite , the ground - state energy of the bec polaron has been studied on the basis of a frhlich type hamiltonian using the feynman variational technique and the dqmc method . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the problem of the bec polaron has been treated using the renormalization group method .",
    "it successfully retrieves the dqmc results in the whole ( available for the comparison ) range of the particle - phonon coupling strength .    very recently ,",
    "interesting works appeared which confirmed new trends in the polaron physics .",
    "these studies are devoted to polaron manifestations in real systems , e. g. , quantum atomic gases @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an impurity embedded in a quasi - two - dimensional bose - einstein atomic condensate is realized as a dark - state polariton .",
    "it is demonstrated show that the interaction of the impurity with phonons lead to photonic polarons , described by the bogoliubov - frhlich hamiltonian . the theoretical study in ref .",
    "@xcite is performed extending a renormalization group approach , developed for frhlich polarons in ref .",
    "the study in ref .",
    "@xcite is devoted to the problem of a mobile impurity moving through a bose - einstein atomic condensate .",
    "the radio frequency spectroscopy of ultracold bosonic atoms is used to experimentally demonstrate the existence of a well - defined quasiparticle state of an impurity interacting with a bec .",
    "both attractive and repulsive polaron - type quasiparticles in bec are realized . the experimental work @xcite is devoted to bose polarons in atomic condensates in the strongly interacting regime .",
    "this is , at the moment , the first measurement of the bose polaron in a three - dimensional trapped atom gas , which probed the energies and lifetimes for both the attractive and repulsive polaron branches . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the dynamics of bose polarons in the vicinity of a feshbach resonance between the impurity and host atoms is studied in the specific setting of radio - frequency spectroscopy of impurity atoms immersed in a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "the authors demonstrate the disappearance of the sharp quasiparticle spectral feature at strong coupling and the presence of a novel type of excitations in which several bogoliubov quasiparticles are bound to the impurity .",
    "this work represents a particular interest for studying nonperturbative phenomena in bose polarons at strong coupling .    in summary ,",
    "polaron physics recently demonstrated new fascinating developments , that makes the present lecture course timely and relevant .",

    "he derived the first weak - coupling perturbation - theory results : @xmath88 and @xmath89 expressions ( [ eq_5a ] ) and ( [ eq_5b ] ) are rigorous to order @xmath69 .",

    "the expectation value of the first term is zero for the wave function @xmath97 therefore one is sure to obtain a variational result .",
    "it is remarkable that merely extracting the @xmath98 term from the expression@xmath99 eliminates the divergency from the problem ( cp . with the case @xmath100 ) and is equivalent to the sophisticated theory by lee , low and pines ( llp ) , which corresponds thus to neglect of the term ( [ corr ] ) .",

    "the significance of the llp approximation consists of the flexibility of the canonical transformations together with the fact that it puts the frhlich result on a variational basis .    to order @xmath106 , the analytical expressions for the coefficients are @xmath106 : @xmath107 for the energy and @xmath108 for the polaron mass @xcite .    at present",

    ", the relaxation time result for the mobility @xcite seems more reliable than the thornber - feynman result .",
    "this might be partly due to the deviation of the electron velocity distribution from a drifted maxwellian as shown analytically @xcite from the boltzmann equation at weak electron - phonon coupling and low temperature in the steady state regime .    because the boltzmann equation is valid at weak electron - phonon coupling , and because of its intuitively transparent structure",

    "@xcite , at strong coupling the distances between different polaron energy levels rise as @xmath2409 , and hence the matrix elements of the electron - phonon interaction diminish .",

    "the contribution to the optical conductivity taking into account non - adiabatic transitions represent in fact the next - to - leading order correction in powers of this small parameter .",
    "consequently , this correction is more significant at weaker couplings , and is relatively small at strong coupling .",
