    "let @xmath3 be a smooth bounded domain with boundary @xmath4 and @xmath5 the laplacian acting on functions with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "we are interested in describing the relationship between certain @xmath6 estimates for the associated spectral projector , obtained recently by h. smith and c. sogge  @xcite , and strichartz inequalities for solutions to the wave equation in @xmath7 .",
    "this relationship turns out to be very simple , natural and optimal ( at least in some range of indexes ) , and is closely related to an earlier remark of mockenhaupt , seeger and sogge regarding fourier integral operators ( @xcite , corollary 3.3 ) . as an application we consider the critical semi - linear wave equation ( with real initial data ) in @xmath8 , @xmath9 which enjoys the conservation of energy @xmath10 our main result reads :    [ th.1 ] for any @xmath11 there exists a unique ( global in time ) solution @xmath12 to   in the space @xmath13    to our knowledge",
    ", the fact that weakened dispersion estimates can still imply optimal ( and scale invariant ) strichartz estimates for the solution to the wave equation was first noticed by the second author  @xcite .",
    "observe that the results obtained in @xcite , though restricted only to the interior of strictly convex domains , are far more precise than the results presented here , and apply to the critical non linear wave equation in higher dimension as well .",
    "the difficulty in proving theorem  [ th.1 ] is that we can not afford any loss in the strichartz estimates we prove : strichartz estimates obtained by tataru  @xcite for lipschitz metrics ( see also the results by anton  @xcite in the schrdinger context ) would certainly improve the classical result ( well posedness for the cubic non linear wave equation ) but it would not be enough to deal with the quintic nonlinearity .",
    "in other dimensions , we can still apply smith and sogge s spectral projectors results , leading to other strichartz type estimates .",
    "the strategy also works for obtaining semi - classical strichartz - type estimates for the schrdinger equation ( see burq , grard and tzvetkov  @xcite ) .",
    "these questions will be addressed elsewhere .    using the material in this paper ,",
    "it is rather standard to prove existence of global smooth solutions , for smooth initial data satisfying compatibility conditions ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the arguments developed in this paper apply equally well to more general defocusing non linearities @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15 finally , let us remark that our results can be localized ( in space ) and consequently hold also in the exterior of any obstacle , and we extend in this framework previous results obtained by smith and sogge  @xcite for convex obstacles .",
    "we shall denote in the remaining of this paper , for @xmath16 , by @xmath17 the domain of @xmath18 ( @xmath19 for @xmath20 ) .",
    "* acknowledgments : * we thank p. grard for various enlightenments about the critical wave equation .",
    "the local ( in time ) existence result for   is in fact an easy consequence of some recent work by smith and sogge  @xcite on the spectral projector defined by @xmath21 .",
    "[ th.smso ] let @xmath3 be a smooth bounded domain , then @xmath22    we now derive from this result some strichartz estimates , which are optimal w.r.t scaling .",
    "[ th.2 ] assume that for some @xmath23 , the spectral projector @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 then the solution to the wave equation @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27    the proof is rather simple .",
    "in fact , one can recast the spectral projector estimate as a square function ( in time ) estimate for the wave equation , and use sobolev in time , as was already observed in @xcite in the context of variable coefficients wave equations ( note that such square function estimates are useful in their own right in a nonlinear context : see e.g. @xcite , appendix b , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath28 be the eigenbasis of @xmath29 consisting in eigenfunctions of @xmath30 associated to the eigenvalues @xmath31 .",
    "let us define on this basis an abstract self adjoint operator @xmath32 e_\\lambda\\ ] ] ( where @xmath33 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath34 ) .",
    "now we prove the estimate with @xmath35 replaced by @xmath36 .",
    "we decompose @xmath37 with @xmath38 using plancherel formula ( for @xmath39 fixed ) , @xmath40 and consequently , using sobolev injection in the time variable for the first inequality , in the last inequality , with @xmath41 , and the fact that @xmath42 from line 3 to line 4 , @xmath43 consequently , @xmath44 is continuous from @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "coming back to @xmath47 , it satisfies @xmath48 therefore , using duhamel formula , minkovski inequality and that both @xmath49 and @xmath50 are bounded on @xmath45 , @xmath51    [ cor.1 ] consider @xmath12 solution to @xmath52 then @xmath53 as a consequence , for any initial data @xmath54 , the critical non linear wave equation   is locally well posed in @xmath55 ; h^1_0 ( \\omega ) ) \\cap l^5((0,t ) ; l^{10 } ( \\omega ) ) \\times   c^0([0,t ] ; l^2 ( \\omega))\\ ] ] ( globally for small norm initial data ) .",
    "this corollary proves the uniqueness part in theorem  [ th.1 ]    to prove corollary  [ cor.1 ] , we observe that according to theorems a and  [ th.2 ] , the operator @xmath56satisfies @xmath57 applying the previous inequality to @xmath58 , and using the @xmath6 elliptic regularity result @xmath59 we get @xmath60 and consequently by ( complex ) interpolation between   and  , @xmath61 finally , by sobolev embedding @xmath62 to conclude , we simply observe that @xmath63 and @xmath64 is an isometry from @xmath29 to @xmath65 , leading to  .",
    "the remaining of corollary  [ cor.1 ] follows by a standard fixed point argument with @xmath66 in the space @xmath67 with a sufficiently small @xmath68 ( depending on the initial data @xmath69 ) .",
    "note that this local in time result holds irrespective of the sign of the nonlinearity .    finally , to obtain the global well posedness result for small initial data , it is enough to remark that if the norm of the initial data is small enough , then the fixed point can be performed in @xmath70 .",
    "then the control of the @xmath71 norm by the energy ( which is conserved along the evolution ) allows to iterate this argument indefinitely leading to global existence .",
    "note that this result holds also irrespective of the sign of the nonlinearity because for small @xmath71 norms , the energy always control the @xmath71 norm .",
    "it turns out that our strichartz estimates are strong enough to extend local to _ global _ existence for arbitrary ( finite energy ) data , when combined with a trace estimate and non concentration arguments .",
    "we have @xmath84 the contributions of @xmath85 are easily dealt with , as previously .",
    "let us focus on the contribution of @xmath86 denote by @xmath87 ; interpolating between   and  , @xmath88 let @xmath89 .",
    "then there exist @xmath90 such that @xmath91 as a consequence , from @xmath92 , @xmath93 by duality we deduce that the operator @xmath94 defined by @xmath95 is bounded from @xmath96 to @xmath29 ( observe that @xmath97 ) ; using   and boundedness of @xmath98 from @xmath99 to @xmath100 , we obtain @xmath101 and @xmath102 but @xmath103 and an application of christ - kiselev lemma  @xcite allows to transfer this property to the operator @xmath104    now we remark that if @xmath105 , we can estimate @xmath106 interpolating between these two inequalities yields @xmath107 following ideas of struwe  @xcite , grillakis  @xcite and shatah - struwe  @xcite , we will localize these estimates on small light cones and use the fact that the @xmath108 norm is small in such small cones .        in this section",
    "we shall always consider solutions in @xmath110 of   having bounded energy and obtained as limits in this space of smooth solutions to the analog of   where the non linearity and the initial data have been smoothed out .",
