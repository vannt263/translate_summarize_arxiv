    "a perfect shuffle is a very natural way of permuting @xmath9 cards of a deck .",
    "the deck is divided in two parts and then the cards are reordered by interleaving the two decks in one of the two possible ways : one leaving the original top card on top ( classical model ) , one leaving the original top card second from the top .",
    "this operation has a very easy mathematical description : one can number the cards from 0 to @xmath10 and write the permutation obtained after performing the shuffle .",
    "diaconis , grahm and kantor @xcite were able to determine the structure of the group generated by the two permutations arising from the two perfect shuffles .",
    "what is interesting , it is the fact that diaconis has been a magician and knew many card tricks based on perfect shuffles .",
    "if a talented magician is able to perform a perfect shuffle , he knows how the cards are distributed in the deck after the shuffle .",
    "the paper @xcite contains a very nice section about the history of the perfect shuffle .",
    "we refer to that paper and references therein for a historical account on this interesting aspect .",
    "it is worth mentioning here the huge literature about shuffling cards and related probabilistic topics @xcite",
    ".    rose @xcite generalized this shuffle by interleaving in a suitable way two sets of size @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the idea is very simple : consider @xmath13 objects grouped in @xmath11 piles of size @xmath12 so that they are disposed in an array with @xmath12 rows and @xmath11 columns . then rearrange them in @xmath12 piles of size @xmath11 just by switching the rows with the columns .",
    "he used the permutation matrices arising from the perfect shuffle of two sets in order to give a method to compute the discrete fourier transform , with an interesting application to the algorithm called fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "fast fourier transforms are widely used for many applications in engineering , science , and mathematics and were described by gilbert strang as  the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime \" @xcite",
    ". rose noticed that its shuffle was somehow related to the kronecker ( tensor ) product of two matrices .",
    "this product is , in general , non - commutative , but the commutation can be achieved up to multiplying with opportune permutation matrices of the shuffle .",
    "this correspondence was further generalized and exploited by davio @xcite , who used simple properties of the algebra generated by the matrices arising from the shuffle in order to describe a wide class of switching circuits .",
    "davio generalized the results of rose by considering @xmath4 subsets instead of just two , and used the mixed radix formalism for applications in network design .",
    "in @xcite , ronse generalized further this construction by introducing generalized shuffling permutations , which contain the cases already studied by rose and davio , as particular cases .",
    "our paper can be framed into the context proposed by davio and ronse .",
    "more precisely , we define a family of permutation matrices , called _ shuffling matrices _ , associated with @xmath4 integers @xmath14 and a permutation @xmath15 : these matrices will be denoted by @xmath16 .",
    "we investigate the corresponding shuffling permutations on @xmath0 elements , their action on rooted trees , and we study shuffling matrices in terms of their action on iterated kronecker products of matrices , the conjugacy problem , and an explicit application to the discrete fourier transform theory . more specifically ,",
    "we consider @xmath4 sets @xmath17 of size @xmath18 , respectively , and identify their cartesian product with the vertices of the @xmath4-th level of a rooted tree whose branch indices are exactly @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 elements of the product can be identified with words of length @xmath4 , whose @xmath20-th letter belongs to the alphabet @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath19 elements are naturally ordered lexicographically , so that the first letter ( or coordinate ) can be seen as the most important , and the @xmath4-th letter as the less important for the ordering .",
    "the motivation for this paper is the following observation : if we permute cyclically the @xmath4 coordinates , by meaning that we permute cyclically their order of importance and consider the lexicographic order given by this rearrangement , we get a permutation which coincides with the perfect shuffle studied by davio .",
    "this reduces to the cases of rose ( for @xmath22 ) and of diaconis , grahm and kantor ( for @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) .",
    "this suggests the idea that one can study the properties usually studied for the perfect shuffle matrices , when the full symmetric group @xmath6 ( and not only cyclic permutations ) is considered .",
    "such generalized shuffling permutationswere studied by ronse in @xcite by using the mixed radix formalism . in our paper , we adopt a matrix approach and we let these permutations act on rooted trees .",
    "this analysis leads to a number of natural questions .",
    "we were able to rephrase the results given by rose and davio in this more general setting and discussed some algebraic properties of the group of permutations on @xmath19 objects generated by shuffling matrices . in the homogeneous case",
    "@xmath24 , this enables us to explicitly construct a subgroup of @xmath8 isomorphic to @xmath6 .",
    "we plan to study , in a future work , products of shuffling matrices and their action on trees or more general combinatorial structures ( in the spirit of @xcite ) , and to investigate the cutoff phenomenon for the associated markov chains @xcite .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sectionpreliminaries ]",
    ", we introduce some basic notation and definitions about mixed radix representation of integers , rooted trees and branch indices , kronecker products , permutation matrices , and we recall some properties and interpretations of the classical perfect shuffle studied by rose and davio . in section [ mainsection ] , we introduce the central definition of the paper , represented by the notion of shuffling matrix , and we study some combinatorial and algebraic properties of such permutation matrices ( section [ sectionmaindefinition ] ) ; in section [ subsectionconjugacy ] , we focus our interest on the conjugacy property . in section [ sectiongruppi ] , the group generated by shuffling permutations is investigated ; in particular , the section [ more ] is devoted to the study of the group consisting of perfect shuffle permutations .",
    "finally , the section [ sectionfourier ] describes an explicit application of the shuffling matrices to the fast fourier transform theory .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows : + @xmath25 in proposition [ propositionaction ] , the image of any integer @xmath26 satisfying @xmath27 under the action of the permutation associated with the shuffling matrix @xmath16 is explicitly described ; + @xmath25 in theorem [ theoremconiugio ] , we prove that shuffling matrices are able to rearrange the factors of an iterated kronecker product of @xmath4 matrices , according with any new order induced by a permutation @xmath15 ; in the square case , this action is achieved by conjugation , as shown in theorem [ coro1coniugio ] ; + @xmath25 in theorem [ teo : gruppo non omogeneo ] , we prove that the group generated by shuffling permutations does not depend on the order of the branch indices , and in corollary [ corollario : gruppo omogeneo ] we deduce that , in the homogeneous case , such group is isomorphic to the symmetric group @xmath6 ; + @xmath25 in proposition [ gruppodeglishuffling ] , we show that the group of perfect shufflings on @xmath19 elements is isomorphic to the multiplicative subgroup of invertible elements of @xmath28 ; + @xmath25 in theorem [ generaltheoremfourier ] , we explicitly describe the block decomposition of the discrete fourier matrix under the action by multiplication of a shuffling permutation matrix : such computation can be considered as the basis of an extended fast fourier transform algorithm .",
    "rose studied in @xcite the perfect shuffle on a set of @xmath29 elements . he proposed to represent the elements @xmath30 of such set in an @xmath31 array @xmath32 according with the ( unique ) representation of each integer in @xmath33 as @xmath34 so that @xmath35 .",

    "the paper of davio was very influential in literature because of its applications : he used his results in order to give a simple description of many switching circuits .",
