    "the nature of the electronic wave functions which undergo the transition to superconductivity in copper - oxide perovskites is still unknown .",
    "it is generally at least tacitly assumed that the superconducting ( sc ) transition at optimal doping does not invoke radically different states than those already present at the fermi level slightly above t@xmath3 . in this approach ,",
    "shared here , the understanding of the normal state is considered the key to the sc mechanism .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ( af ) instability in the vicinity of half - filling in the same compounds is by contrast well understood  @xcite as a charge - transfer effect , dominating the first ( large mott - hubbard interaction @xmath4 ) coulomb correction  @xcite to the ideal ( paramagnetic ) mott insulator  @xcite .",
    "theoretical attempts to connect this underdoped region with the sc region on the hole - doped side abound in the literature .",
    "they have received early support in the ionic limit by the zhang - rice  @xcite construction , which considered an added hole in an af background , when double occupation of the copper site was blocked by a large @xmath4 .",
    "it is known that the hole then occupies the oxygen sites , each bridging two coppers in the cuo@xmath5 plane .",
    "assuming that the hole prefers to bind with one of the coppers , zhang and rice have shown that a uniform spreading of the hole around that copper , in an orbitally symmetric `` zhang - rice singlet '' ( zrs ) is energetically strongly preferred , and propagates like a projected fermion .",
    "this provided a way to vindicate the single - band @xmath0@xmath2 model as a physical reduction of the emery ( three - band hubbard ) model  @xcite , at least for underdoped systems , as an alternative to the usual formal derivation , which applies the foldy - wouthuysen transformation to the one - band hubbard model  @xcite .",
    "challenges to this picture come from two directions .",
    "one is fundamental , that there is no _ a priori _ reason for the hole to prefer one copper over the other . when it is undecided , triplet states are strongly admixed , while it may still move about as a fermion  @xcite .",
    "the other is to accept the basic idea of a single cuo@xmath6 molecule , but consider additional states and overlaps within it , to find the limits of the particular construction employed  @xcite .",
    "in the present work , the natural next step in the zhang - rice construction is taken , which introduces just one additional singlet , occupying the oxygen sites .    as will be shown below",
    ", such an extension is the minimal model to express the low - energy physics of optimally doped high - t@xmath3 superconductors in the small - cluster language . at optimal doping ,",
    "the zhang - rice ground state becomes strongly admixed with said oxygen singlet , chosen by the same symmetry arguments as originally used by zhang and rice  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the calculation is used as an opportunity to introduce classification of state vectors by dynamical symmetry on a small example .",
    "this method may have some potential for larger problems .",
    "quantum chemical calculations on small clusters predict the regime @xmath7 used by zhang and rice , and confirmed in xps experiments  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath8 is the copper - oxygen splitting , positive in the hole picture , while @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the copper - oxygen and oxygen - oxygen overlaps , respectively . in the limit ( [ qcr ] ) ,",
    "the zrs is the ground state .",
    "the energy scale of the xps experiments and corresponding calculations is 510  ev . in high - t@xmath3 materials , there is a universally acknowledged crossover scale of the order of 0.1  ev between the lowest and higher energies , although it is still debated whether its origin is phononic  @xcite or magnetic  @xcite .",
    "neither small - cluster nor lda calculations obtain this crossover , and the latter are consistent with the high - energy result ( [ qcr ] ) .",
    "a recent analysis  @xcite showed three distinct many - body scales in bscco which were not reproduced by contemporary lda calculations , the lowest of which was the above - mentioned crossover , the middle the so - called `` waterfall , '' not of interest here , and the highest an `` anomalous enhancement '' of the lda - predicted band - width , by about 0.8  ev visible below @xmath11 in optimally doped bscco , i.e.  roughly twice that in full . in principle ,",
    "lda calculations are able to reach lower energy scales than small clusters .",
    "thus no ab initio effort has so far reached the vicinity of the fermi level in high - t@xmath3 superconductors . below the crossover scale ,",
    "the physical regime of the electrons actually undergoing the transition to superconductivity must still be inferred from phenomenological analysis of low - energy experiments .",
    "the optimally doped region is equally well connected to the metallic overdoped region as to the underdoped one .",
    "attempts to understand the high - t@xmath3 perovskites at optimal doping starting from the paramagnetic metal have a long standing on the hole - doped side  @xcite .",
    "they have mostly been framed in terms of the mean - field slave - boson ( mfsb ) formalism , allowing for effective multiband approaches , in which the values of the orbital parameters depart significantly from those expected on the basis of high - energy experiments and lda calculations  @xcite .    instead of taking the high - energy `` bare '' regime as the starting point , and introducing many - body effects to reach lower energies",
    ", mfsb phenomenology goes in the opposite direction . beginning with unprejudiced zeroth - order fits at the fermi level ,",
    "one introduces the minimal perturbation necessary to model the lowest crossover .",
    "such an analysis of angle - resloved photoemission ( arpes )  @xcite has recently been extended to electron - doped compounds  @xcite , and produced the interesting result , that their lowest - energy sector is in a very similar physical regime as in the hole - doped ones  @xcite : a large direct oxygen - oxygen hopping @xmath10 , significantly larger than the effective copper - oxygen hopping @xmath9 , and with a band - width of the same order as the effective copper - oxygen splitting @xmath12 , in the hole picture : @xmath13 the arpes scales on which this observation is based are 0.2  ev in bscco and 0.5  ev in ncco .",
    "the lowest - energy crossover was modelled by a @xmath14 boson , whose scales were associated with af in the same compounds .",
    "the low - energy regime ( [ phr ] ) , markedly different from ( [ qcr ] ) , is characterized in particular by an `` anticrossing '' of the wide oxygen band with the copper level , so that the fermi level is found in an oxygen - dominated , strongly dispersive part of the brillouin zone , even though @xmath15 .",
    "as will now be shown , a directly analogous regime exists in the ionic limit .",
    "is physical  @xcite.,height=188 ]    the hamiltonian of a single cuo@xmath6 molecule is @xmath16 where @xmath17 describes the four oxygens around the copper , and @xmath18 , @xmath19 are the number operators of the copper and oxygen orbitals .",
    "the relevant orbitals and parameters  @xcite are shown in figure  [ figorb ] .",
    "all 25 states of two holes with opposite spins on the five orbitals are taken into account .",
    "standard symmetry analysis is used to reduce the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) to block - diagonal form .",
    "the basic symmetry is of the square , corresponding to the group @xmath20 .",
    "take the @xmath21-axis , orthogonal to the molecular plane , to be the spin quantization axis .",
    "since the spins have total projection zero , flipping all spins is a symmetry operation , and since all orbitals are planar , this is equivalent to a reflection in the plane",
    ". then @xmath22 is the magnetic ( color ) group of the problem , and both the zhang - rice singlet , @xmath23 , and the doubly - occupied copper state , @xmath24 , fall in its @xmath25 representation , containing five singlets .    as usual ,",
    "the main symmetry group does not fix the state vectors in full .",
    "it is easy to complete the reduction by hand , but instructive to identify the reasons for the remaining ambiguities .",
    "one is , as expected , symmetry with respect to a subgroup , @xmath26 .",
    "the particular @xmath27 group involved contains the spin - flip and three @xmath28 rotations , about the @xmath21-axis and about the two diagonals at @xmath29 relative to the cu  o axes .",
    "it stands out because its operations change the sign of the copper - oxygen overlap @xmath9 , while the energies depend only on @xmath30 .",
    "the more interesting reason is dynamical symmetry , imposed by the assumed degeneracy of the four oxygen orbitals .",
    "it eventually affects only two @xmath31 vectors , but to fix them `` honestly , '' the full dynamical symmetry apparatus must be invoked , even on such a small problem as the present one .",
    "the group elements are the hamiltonian terms which break the oxygen degeneracy .",
    "two are visible in ( [ ham ] ) , proportional to @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "if these are represented by matrices in one - particle space , multiplying them generates the third , which corresponds physically to next - nearest - neighbor ( n - n - n ) hops from one oxygen to the other on the same axis .",
    "these three ( and the identity ) form the abelian group @xmath34 , appearing here as a dynamical symmetry group .",
    "the n - n - n term must be diagonalized simultaneously with the sum of @xmath10 terms in ( [ ham ] ) to separate out the last vector without manual intervention .",
    "the outstanding physical feature of dynamical symmetries is that they can connect states with doubly and singly occupied degenerate sites , obviously impossible by geometrical transformations .",
    "two technical advantages of dynamical over geometrical symmetry groups are that they grow with the size of the problem , and depend on topology rather than shape .",
    "both are significant when the clusters are motivated by solid - state investigations , and contain many equivalent sites .",
    "e.g. , the dynamical group of the four oxygens in two - particle space is @xmath35 , with sixteen elements , again abelian .",
    "it is not needed here because the geometrical symmetry already reduces the problem to very small blocks . on the other hand ,",
    "as a molecule becomes larger , the blocks due to dynamical symmetry are expected to become smaller than those selected by geometrical symmetry , especially if the molecule is of odd shape , as is common in monte carlo calculations .",
    "the complete reduction gives ten stationary states unaffected by @xmath9 .",
    "in addition the hamiltonian contains six 2@xmath362 blocks and one 3@xmath363 block .",
    "the latter is found in the @xmath25 subspace , connecting the states @xmath24 , @xmath23 , and an oxygen two - hole singlet , @xmath37 : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are doubly occupied states , and @xmath40 are antisymmetrized singly occupied states .",
    "the numbers 14 refer to the four oxygens , as in fig .",
    "[ figorb ] .",
    "the block reads : @xmath41{1.4 cm } { $ \\begin{array}{r } \\left|d^8\\right>\\,:\\\\ \\left|zr\\right>\\,:\\\\ \\left|p^{-2}\\right>\\ , : \\end{array } $ } \\parbox[b]{6.2 cm } { $ \\left ( \\begin{array}{ccc } 2{\\varepsilon_d}+u_d & 2 \\sqrt{2}{t_{pd } } & 0 \\\\ 2 \\sqrt{2}{t_{pd } } & { \\varepsilon_d}+{\\varepsilon_p}+2{t_{pp } }   & 2 \\sqrt{2}{t_{pd } } \\\\ 0 & 2 \\sqrt{2}{t_{pd } } & 2{\\varepsilon_p}+4{t_{pp } } \\end{array } \\right ) $ } \\label{model}\\ ] ] the states @xmath37 and @xmath24 have an equally large coherence factor @xmath42 with respect to @xmath23 , as found by perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "however , the coherence factor of the oxygen - oxygen overlap @xmath10 is twice as large for @xmath37 as for @xmath23 .",
    "since the physical sign of @xmath10 is negative , this is a generic mechanism to destabilize the zrs for all values of @xmath4 ( including @xmath43 ) , which identifies @xmath37 as a relevant perturbation of the zhang - rice ground state .    by the same analysis",
    ", the orbital - antisymmetric singlet @xmath44 , also considered by zhang and rice , appears in a 2@xmath362 , @xmath31 block with another oxygen singlet , call it @xmath45 : @xmath46{1.4 cm } { $ \\begin{array}{r } \\left|oa\\right>\\,:\\\\ \\left|pp\\right>\\ , : \\end{array } $ } \\parbox[b]{4 cm } { $ \\left ( \\begin{array}{cc } { \\varepsilon_d}+{\\varepsilon_p}-2{t_{pp } }   & 2 t_{pd } \\\\ 2 t_{pd } & 2{\\varepsilon_p } \\end{array } \\right ) $ } \\label{oa}\\ ] ] the splitting here is also @xmath47 , as between @xmath37 and @xmath23 in ( [ model ] ) , but it occurs because the copper - oxygen singlet is antibonding ( @xmath48 ) , while the oxygen singlet is non - bonding with respect to @xmath10 .",
    "its structure is @xmath49 the orbital - antisymmetric state remains irrelevant in the presence of oxygen - oxygen hopping .",
    "the @xmath9-coherence factors in ( [ model ] ) and ( [ oa ] ) may be identified by perturbation theory  @xcite , without the need to distinguish between @xmath37 and @xmath45 . however , once @xmath10 is introduced , the different effects on @xmath23 and @xmath44 are related to the different symmetry properties of @xmath37 and @xmath45 .",
    "the zhang - rice singlet @xmath23 is destabilized because @xmath37 has a large coherence factor @xmath50 , while @xmath44 moves upwards `` out of the way , '' and @xmath45 can not influence the ground state because it is unaffected by @xmath10 ( but of course it can anticross with @xmath44 as the latter rises ) .    ) .,height=188 ]    the coherence factors in the reduced model ( [ model ] ) are the largest in the whole space , so for @xmath51 and @xmath48 it contains the ground state .",
    "the relevant parameters are @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the precise value of @xmath9 is irrelevant , as long as one is in the parameter regime ( [ phr ] ) , corresponding to optimal doping . choosing it low for graphical reasons , one obtains figure  [ figpar ] . at the origin",
    "( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) is the weak - coupling regime , where the ground state is dominated by @xmath24 .",
    "as @xmath4 increases , this state goes through two anticrossings with the others , ending up highest in the zhang - rice regime ( @xmath4 large , @xmath56 small ) , where @xmath23 is the ground state .",
    "now as @xmath56 increases , the state @xmath37 goes down at twice the rate of @xmath23 , so it must eventually anticross with it .",
    "thus when both @xmath4 and @xmath56 are large , the zrs is no longer the ground state .",
    "the present paper describes a simple and robust symmetry - based mechanism which prevents the isolation of the zrs as the only candidate for the ground state of the cuo@xmath6 ion when @xmath4 is large . to wit ,",
    "if the oxygen - oxygen hopping @xmath10 is significant , the local environment will be in a charge transfer regime involving two states , the zrs and an oxygen singlet .",
    "the two are mixed by the symmetry - enhanced overlap @xmath42 across the symmetry - reduced gap @xmath47 .",
    "this is the metallic counterpart to the result  @xcite that the antiferromagnetic interaction @xmath2 near half - filling is also dominated by the charge - transfer term @xmath57 , while the mott - anderson contribution @xmath58 is negligible .",
    "it has long been established that arpes fits require significant ratios of @xmath59 in order to agree with the data  @xcite .",
    "recently there appeared detailed arpes fits , both qualitatively and quantitatively in accord with experiment , in practically the same orbital regime for ncco  @xcite and bscco  @xcite , which established the anticrossing regime ( [ phr ] ) as an appropriate phenomenology for these compounds , meaning the ratio @xmath60 is also enhanced , especially so on the electron - doped side .",
    "changes in orbital parameters as a function of doping are a standard feature of effective theories such as mean - field slave - boson ( mfsb ) , which account for the effects of strong correlations by changing @xmath9 and @xmath61 .",
    "the question , as always with effective band models , is what this means for the local environment : do local hops `` see '' the bare or the renormalized band parameters .",
    "the conclusion that the effective band regime at optimal doping is reflected in an analogous local regime , which implies the destabilization of the zhang - rice singlet by the above symmetry mechanism , is supported by two independent arguments , one phenomenological and one theoretical .",
    "the recently emphasized  @xcite failure of lda calculations to reproduce experimentally observed band widths is phenomenologically significant , because lda predicts a smaller width than is actually observed , so any conceivable inclusion of additional correlations would only make the discrepancy larger .",
    "notably , lda calculations agree with high - energy experiments and calculations in the ionic limit .",
    "the anomalous enhancement of hopping via the oxygen sites is consistent by symmetry with the observed discrepancy , which is large in the nodal direction , where the oxygen band is strongly dispersive .",
    "the enhancement of the arpes bandwidth of 12  ev over lda predictions  @xcite is quantitatively in good agreement with the value of @xmath10 needed to enter the anticrossing regime , i.e.destabilize the zrs .",
    "theoretically , the parameter space of the three - band mfsb model has been extensively investigated  @xcite from the point of view of outcomes , namely : which regions of renormalized orbital parameters are indicative of strong renormalization of input parameters by the mfsb mechanism , and which imply preservation of the bare parameters . in the so - called `` resonant - band '' regime , characterized by",
    "a narrow effective bonding band and copper - dominated wave functions , the quasiparticle weight in the conduction band is significantly reduced , being proportional to the doping @xmath62 instead of the total hole content @xmath63 . in that case , the band calculations can not be directly related to a local picture , since the doped - hole weight is locally either one or zero .",
    "however , in the anticrossing regime ( [ phr ] ) , the opposite occurs : mfsb theories with gaussian fluctuations depart from the resonant - band regime and acquire a full quasiparticle weight in the brillouin zone , only with a reduced @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "they are therefore comparable and consistent with the present ionic ones , as long as both are in the anticrossing limit .",
    "thus the present work reaffirms the possibility  @xcite that the optimizations leading to a large direct oxygen - oxygen overlap below the crossover scale occur already at the local orbital level .",
    "realistically , @xmath9 is not so small , so the ground state in real materials retains substantial copper content . in the local picture , this means a significant zrs content in the ground state .",
    "however , even if @xmath9 is as large as @xmath56 , giving a large anticrossing gap @xmath64 , the ground state still contains nearly equal components of @xmath23 and @xmath37 .",
    "the system is physically in the charge - transfer regime , which also provides the dominant contribution  @xcite to @xmath2 . in that case , the reduction to one band by the limit  @xcite @xmath65 is purely formal , since that limit replaces the charge - transfer regime _ a priori _ by the mott regime .",
    "while the mfsb calculations allow both for regimes with strong renormalization and no renormalization  @xcite , the derivation of the @xmath0@xmath2 model from the zrs  @xcite implies by construction that the band parameters are locally relevant .",
    "however , it has been noticed  @xcite that in order to face experiment , the @xmath0@xmath2 model needs to be supplemented by additional next- and next - next - nearest neighbor hops , making up the so - called @xmath0@xmath1@xmath66@xmath2 model . since the @xmath1 term breaks particle - hole symmetry in the same way as the @xmath10 term in the three - band model , its appearance in practical calculations  @xcite is immediate evidence that the oxygen degree of freedom can not be eliminated from the physical picture near optimal doping .",
    "the need to introduce @xmath1 at the band level translates microscopically into the need to admix the oxygen singlet ( [ p2 ] ) to the zrs , to describe the local electronic environment around optimal doping .",
    "( when the oxygen is treated explicitly in the band picture , @xmath10 has the same sign for both n- and p - doping  @xcite , as also found in lda calculations  @xcite , consistently with its simple chemical interpretation . )    to see the real effect of the @xmath1 term , the dispersion of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 terms may be rewritten @xmath67 separating contributions by particle - hole symmetry .",
    "the second term is manifestly symmetric around half - filling , while the third is not , since it achieves its minimum value ( zero ) along the non - dispersive lines @xmath68 and @xmath69 . in practice @xmath70 , and the ratio @xmath71@xmath72 . for @xmath73 , a common enough parametrization around optimal doping , @xmath74 , so the symmetry - breaking term enters with _ three times _ the contribution of the symmetry - preserving term .",
    "thus the apparently small values of @xmath75 found in the literature are quite misleading in terms of the actual amount of particle - hole symmetry breaking needed to achieve realistic fermi surface fits within the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model . in particular , for @xmath76 the symmetry - preserving term vanishes , so the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model passes through a quantum phase transition in the vicinity of its applicable parameter range .    by symmetry , this is the same type of transition appearing in the present paper as the destabilization of the zrs in the three - band case .",
    "physically , they are different insofar as the three - band model destabilizes the zrs by oxygen hopping in low order , while in the @xmath0@xmath1@xmath2 model the zhang - rice singlets are preserved by assumption , and the transition occurs by the additional @xmath1 overlap among them , i.e.  in high order in the original three - band model . but to account for arpes data , both models agree that such a transition is approached near optimal doping .    the limitation of the above arguments to the metallic phase should be kept in mind . near",
    "half - filling , the oxygen hopping is effectively reduced by the antiferromagnetic interactions , and precisely at half - filling , the system is insulating independently of the value of @xmath10 . in the insulating phase ,",
    "the high - energy ionic limit is recovered , both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "as @xmath10 becomes more effective with doping , locally the first admixture to the zrs appears , identified here as the oxygen singlet ( [ p2 ] ) .",
    "thus a broad picture of the optimal - doping regimes of high - t@xmath3 compounds emerges , in which ncco is deep in the anticrossing regime , @xmath77 , and bscco is at its limit , @xmath78 . on the other hand ,",
    "the remarkable fermi - surface evolution of lsco with doping  @xcite is indicative of strong renormalizations of the band parameters , especially when the system is underdoped .",
    "in such a resonant - band regime , it was also shown directly  @xcite that the strong doping - dependence of @xmath10 in the mfsb fits did not imply a similar variation of the local parameters .",
    "the present analysis points to one pitfall of considering the oxygen part of the zrs as a single - particle state in its own right , as if the hole on the copper were unhybridized with the oxygens .",
    "however , the same caution applies to the oxygen singlet found here . in particular",
    ", one should be careful in interpreting the corresponding bloch states .",
    "the propagation of strongly correlated cluster states in a lattice is at present largely unexplored in more than one dimension , with controlled analytic results available only in special limits , which themselves amount to uncontrolled simplifications .",
    "such is the limit of infinite dimensions  @xcite , physically corresponding to diffusion , or the falicov - kimball limit  @xcite , which is dispersive , but replaces dynamical constraints by geometrical ones .",
    "the model presented here is as sparse as possible , allowing for the experimentally observed regime with only three state vectors . to avoid being too minimal ,",
    "some attention should be paid to the neglected coulomb integrals @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , the on - site oxygen , intracell oxygen , and copper - oxygen repulsions , respectively .",
    "they do not break the symmetries above , introducing only matrix elements within each symmetry block .",
    "in particular , they connect the ground - state block ( [ model ] ) with the other two @xmath25 states by matrix elements @xmath82 , smaller than the terms @xmath83 . on the diagonal of this block",
    ", the coulomb terms can be reabsorbed in the site energies and copper on - site repulsion @xmath4 .",
    "for realistic @xmath84 , this leads to a small reduction in the copper - oxygen splitting @xmath61 , and practically no change in @xmath4 , while for large @xmath85 , a useful limiting case , the effective @xmath4 is increased and the effective @xmath61 decreased , both by about 1  ev .",
    "thus the inclusion of neglected integrals mildly tends to push the system further into the anticrossing , @xmath43 regime .",
    "an extension of the zhang - rice argument to the electron - doped side is only possible with larger molecules , containing more than one copper atom .",
    "this would allow to study the competition of magnetic and charge ordering at the local level .",
    "it also opens a way to compare the zhang - rice and emery - reiter  @xcite constructions directly on the hole - doped side . obviously , the spaces involved are much larger .",
    "it is on these larger problems , both theoretical and numerical , that hope is invested in the assignment of quantum numbers by dynamical symmetries , as introduced in the present work .",
    "it has been found that in the presence of local repulsion on copper , the direct oxygen - oxygen overlap is a relevant perturbation of the zhang - rice singlet . with the possible exception of lsco ,",
    "real hole- and electron - doped high - t@xmath3 superconductors appear to be in a physical regime where it is strongly mixed with a pure oxygen singlet .",
