    "a record is an entry in a discrete time series that is larger ( _ upper record _ ) or smaller ( _ lower record _ ) than all previous entries .",
    "thus , records are extreme values that are defined not relative to a fixed threshold , but relative to all preceding events that have occurred since the beginning of the process .",
    "statistical data in areas like meteorology @xcite , hydrology @xcite and athletics @xcite are naturally represented in terms of records .",
    "records play an important role in the public perception of issues like anthropogenic climate change and natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes , and they are an integral part of popular culture . indeed , the _ guinness book of records _ , first published in 1955 , is the world s most sold copyrighted book .",
    "the mathematical theory of records was initiated more than 50 years ago @xcite , and it is now a mature subfield of probability theory and statistics ; see @xcite for reviews and @xcite for an elementary introduction .",
    "most of this work has been devoted to the case when the time series under consideration consists of independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables ( rv s ) . for the following discussion",
    ", it will be useful to distinguish between the _ record times _ at which the current record is broken and replaced by a new one , and the associated _ record values_. one of the key results of record theory is that the statistical properties of record times for real - valued i.i.d .",
    "rv s are completely independent of the underlying distribution .",
    "to illustrate the origin of this universality , we recall the basic observation that the probability @xmath5 for a record to occur in the @xmath0th time step ( the _ record rate _ ) is given by @xmath6 for i.i.d .",
    "rv s , because each of the @xmath0 first entries @xmath7 , including the last , is equally likely to be the largest or smallest . the mean number of records up to time @xmath0 , @xmath8 , is therefore given by the harmonic series @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "further considerations along the same lines lead to a remarkably complete characterization of record times , which will be briefly reviewed below in section [ sec : iid ] .",
    "the universality of record times can be exploited in statistical tests of the i.i.d .",
    "property of a given sequence of variables , without the need for any hypothesis about the underlying distribution @xcite .",
    "by contrast , distributions of record values fall into three distinct universality classes , which are largely analogous to the well - known asymptotic laws of extreme value statistics for distributions with exponential - like tails ( _ gumbel _ ) , bounded support ( _ weibull _ ) and power law tails ( _ frchet _ ) , respectively @xcite .",
    "the decay of the record rate ( [ rate ] ) with increasing @xmath0 implies that the record breaking events form a non - stationary time series with unusual statistical properties , which will be further discussed below in section [ sec : iid ] . _ record dynamics _",
    "has therefore been proposed as a paradigm for the non - stationary temporal behaviour of diverse complex systems ranging from the low - temperature relaxation of spin glasses to the co - evolution of biological populations @xcite .",
    "in fact , records appear naturally in the theory of biological adaptation , because any evolutionary innovation that successfully spreads in a population must be a record , in the sense that it accomplishes some task encountered by the organism in a way that is superior to all previously existing solutions .",
    "consequently the statistics of records and extremes has been invoked to understand the distribution of fitness increments in adaptive processes @xcite as well as the timing of adaptive events @xcite . in the biological context",
    "the universality of record time statistics is particularly attractive , because genotypical fitness is a somewhat elusive notion that is hard to quantify in terms of explicit probability distributions .",
    "surprisingly few result on record statistics are known that go beyond the standard setting of i.i.d .",
    "rv s , and thus consider correlated and/or non - identically distributed rv s . in the present article we focus exclusively on the latter issue , while maintaining the independence among the entries in the sequence .",
    "a simple example of this type was introduced by yang in an attempt to explain the frequency of occurrence of olympic records , which is much higher than would be expected on the basis of the i.i.d .",
    "theory @xcite . in his model",
    "a specified number of i.i.d .",
    "rv s become available simultaneously in each time step , corresponding , in the athletic context , to a variable ( growing ) population from which the contenders are drawn .",
    "much of the standard theory can be extended to this case @xcite ( see section [ sec : growing ] for a brief review ) .",
    "in particular , one finds that the record rate becomes asymptotically constant for exponentially growing populations .",
    "an application of yang s model to evolutionary searches in the space of genotypic sequences can be found in @xcite . a second line of research has addressed the case of sequences with a linear trend , in which the @xmath0th entry is of the form @xmath11 with i.i.d .",
    "rv s @xmath12 and @xmath13 @xcite . also in this case the record rate becomes asymptotically constant , see section [ sec : growing ] for details .",
    "the effect of trends on the occurrence rate of records is a key issue in the ongoing debate about the observable consequences of global warming @xcite . in this context",
    "it has been pointed out that climate _ variability _ is presumably a more important factor in determining the frequency of extreme events than averages @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to investigate the record statistics of sequences of uncorrelated rv s in which the _ shape _ of the underlying probability distribution changes systematically with time .",
    "to initiate such an investigation is the goal of the present paper . throughout",
    "we assume that the probability density @xmath14 of the @xmath0th entry @xmath15 is of the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a fixed normalized distribution and the @xmath18 usually have a power - law time dependence @xmath19 so that @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) corresponds to a broadening ( sharpening ) distribution .",
    "after a brief review of a few important classic results of the theory of records in section [ sec : classic ] , our new results for non - indentically distributed random variables will be presented in section [ sec : record ] .",
    "we focus on the asymptotic behaviour of the record rate @xmath5 and the mean number of records @xmath8 .",
    "preliminary numerical results for the variance of the number of records are reported in section [ sec : numerics ] , but a more complete characterization of record times and record values is left for future work . finally , some concluding remarks are offered in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "given the distributions @xmath22 of the entries @xmath23 in a sequence of independent rv s , the probability @xmath5 that the @xmath0th entry is an upper record is equal to the probability that @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "hence @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the cumulative distribution of @xmath23 .",
    "similarly the probability that @xmath15 is a lower record reads @xmath28.\\ ] ] equations ( [ upper ] ) and ( [ lower ] ) form the basis for most of what follows .      for i.i.d .",
    "rv s the integral ( [ upper ] ) can be performed by noting that @xmath29 and @xmath30 , which yields the universal result ( [ rate ] ) .",
    "to arrive at a characterization of the record time process beyond the mean number of records @xmath8 we introduce the _ record indicator variables _ @xmath31 , which take the value @xmath32 iff @xmath15 is a record , and @xmath33 else .",
    "it turns out that the @xmath31 are independent @xcite , and hence they form a bernoulli process with success probability @xmath5 . to see why this is so , consider the two - point correlation function @xmath34 and assume that @xmath35 .",
    "then the key idea is that the right hand side of @xmath36\\ ] ] can be split into independent events according to @xmath37 \\times { \\mathrm{prob}}[x_j = \\max(x_{i+1}, ... ,x_j ) ] \\times \\nonumber \\\\ \\times { \\mathrm{prob}}[\\max(x_1, ... ,x_i ) < \\max(x_{i+1}, ... ,x_j)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] following the symmetry argument used to derive ( [ rate ] ) , the first two factors are @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively , and the third factor can be written as @xmath40 =   \\frac{j - i}{j}.\\ ] ] we conclude that @xmath41 higher order correlations can be shown to factorize in the same way .",
    "the number @xmath42 of records up to time @xmath0 can then be expressed in terms of the indicator variables as @xmath43 and the variance of @xmath42 is @xmath44 for @xmath45 .",
    "the _ index of dispersion _",
    "@xmath46 of the record time process @xcite , defined as the ratio of the variance to the mean @xmath47 thus tends to unity , and the distribution of the @xmath42 becomes poissonian with mean @xmath1 for large @xmath0 .",
    "the record times form a _ log - poisson _",
    "process @xcite .",
    "a second useful observation concerns the ratios between consecutive record times .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the time of the @xmath49th record , with @xmath50 by convention . repeating the symmetry argument used to derive ( [ rate ] )",
    ", we expect that given @xmath48 , the preceding @xmath51th record occurs with equal probability anywhere in the interval @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "this is not quite correct , because the previous @xmath53 records also have to be accomodated , but since @xmath54 this is a small correction which can be neglected for large @xmath49 .",
    "it is therefore plausible ( and can be proved @xcite ) that the ratio @xmath55 tends to a uniformly distributed rv @xmath56 $ ] for large @xmath49 .",
    "moreover the @xmath57 become independent in this limit @xcite .",
    "this allows us to highlight a peculiar property of the sequence of record breaking events : the expected value of @xmath58 , given @xmath48 , is @xmath59 but the reverse conditioning yields an _ infinite _ expectation , because @xmath60 in this sense , the occurrence of records can be predicted only with hindsight , but not forward in time .      in the model for growing populations introduced by yang @xcite and elaborated by nevzorov @xcite , a number @xmath61 of of i.i.d .",
    "rv s becomes available simultaneously at time @xmath0 .",
    "the symmetry argument in section [ sec : intro ] is easily extended to this case : because of the i.i.d .",
    "property , the probability that there is a record among the @xmath61 newly generated rv s is equal to the ratio of @xmath61 to the total number of rv s that have appeared up to time @xmath0 , and hence @xmath62 the independence of the record indicator variables @xmath12 introduced above in section [ sec : iid ] continues to hold @xcite , so again the sequence of record breaking events is a bernouilli process with success probability @xmath5 .    to give a simple example for the consequences of ( [ rate_yang ] ) , suppose the @xmath61 grow exponentially as as @xmath63 with @xmath64 .",
    "this could model a sequence of athletic competitions in an exponentially growing population , where each athlete is assumed to be able to participate only in one event @xcite .",
    "then the evaluation of ( [ rate_yang ] ) yields @xmath65 and the distribution of inter - record times @xmath66 is geometric . in his analysis of olympic records yang estimated a growth factor of @xmath67 for the four - year period between two games , and concluded that this growth rate was insufficient to explain the observed high frequency of records .    motivated by this outcome , ballerini and resnick @xcite considered a model of _ improving _ populations , where the sequence of rv s displays a linear drift according to ( [ trend ] ) .",
    "they showed that the record rate tends to an asymptotic limit @xmath68 given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the probability density of the i.i.d .",
    "rv s @xmath71 in ( [ trend ] ) and @xmath72 = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty } \\prod_{k=1}^{n-1 } q(y + ck),\\ ] ] with @xmath73 .",
    "the function @xmath68 has the obvious limits @xmath74 and @xmath75 , but the explicit evaluation is generally difficult .",
    "a simple expression is obtained when @xmath76 is of gumbel form , @xmath77 $ ] , which yields @xmath78 . for further details on the model ( [ trend ] ) and applications to athletic data",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "results for specific distributions and an application to global warming can be found in @xcite .",
    "in this section we want to evaluate the record rates ( [ upper ] ) and ( [ lower ] ) for distributions of the general form ( [ shape ] ) .",
    "introducing the cumulative distribution corresponding to @xmath17 , @xmath79 the record rates of interest can be written as @xmath80 and @xmath81,\\ ] ] which makes clear the obvious fact that the overall scale of the @xmath18 s is without importance .      in some special cases",
    "the record rates can be evaluated exactly for arbitrary choices of the @xmath18 s .",
    "for example , for the exponential distribution @xmath82 we have @xmath83 , and the evaluation of the lower record rate ( [ lower1 ] ) yields @xmath84 inserting the power law behaviour ( [ power ] ) we see that the denominator converges to the riemann zeta function @xmath85 for @xmath86 , so that @xmath87 for large @xmath0 , and the expected number of lower records @xmath88 remains finite for @xmath45 . for @xmath89 we have instead that @xmath90 for large @xmath0 , and hence @xmath91 asymptotically .",
    "as would be intuitively expected , the occurrence of lower records is enhanced for sharpening distributions ( @xmath21 ) and suppressed for broadening distributions ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "finally , in the borderline case @xmath92 we find @xmath93 which is our first example of a nontrivial asymptotic law that differs qualitatively from the i.i.d . result ( [ harmonic ] ) .",
    "a simple explicit expression for the upper record rate @xmath5 can be obtained for the uniform distribution characterized by @xmath94 when the @xmath95 are increasing , in the sense that @xmath96 for all @xmath25 , i.e. for the case of a sharpening uniform distribution .",
    "then the arguments of @xmath97 on the right hand side of ( [ upper1 ] ) are all less than unity , and direct integration yields @xmath98 inserting the power law form ( [ power ] ) with @xmath21 one finds that the record rate decays exponentially as @xmath99 , and hence the asymptotic number of records is finite for all @xmath21 .      in this section",
    "we focus on broadening distributions , @xmath20 , and evaluate the upper record rate ( [ upper1 ] ) asymptotically for representatives of all three universality classes of extreme value statistics .",
    "the starting point is to replace the product on the right hand side of ( [ upper1 ] ) by the exponential of a sum of logarithms , and to replace the latter by an integral .",
    "it then follows that the asymptotic behaviour of the record rate is given by @xmath100 the second representation will prove to be useful in the final evaluation of @xmath5 . note that @xmath101 can always be expressed in terms of @xmath97 because @xmath102 .",
    "the function @xmath103 is given by @xmath104 where in the second step it has been used that the integral in ( [ asym ] ) is dominated for large @xmath0 by the region where @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "it is therefore clear that the asymptotic behaviour of the record rate depends only on the tail of @xmath97 , and hence universality in the sense of standard extreme value statistics should apply .",
    "the evaluation of ( [ galpha ] ) is straightforward for the frchet class of distributions with power law tails .",
    "we set @xmath107 and obtain @xmath108 inserting this into ( [ asym ] ) yields @xmath109 for large @xmath0 , and hence @xmath110 this result remains valid for negative @xmath111 as long as @xmath112 .",
    "when @xmath113 the evaluation of @xmath103 shows that @xmath114 and thus the asymptotic number of records remains finite .",
    "the gumbel class comprises unbounded distributions whose tail decays faster than a power law @xcite .",
    "a typical representative is the exponentical distribution ( [ exponential ] ) with @xmath115 .",
    "evaluation of ( [ galpha ] ) yields @xmath116 where @xmath117 denotes the incomplete gamma function . for large @xmath101",
    "we have @xcite @xmath118 so that @xmath119 which yields @xmath120 =   \\int_0 ^ 1 dv \\ ; \\exp[-n v/(\\alpha \\ln(1/v))].\\ ] ] to further evaluate the integral we substitute @xmath121 and obtain @xmath122 \\to \\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\to \\frac{\\ln n}{n } \\int_0^\\infty dw \\ ; e^{-w/\\alpha } =   \\frac{\\alpha \\ln n}{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath45 .",
    "correspondingly the mean number of records grows as @xmath123    a second important representative of the gumbel class is the gaussian ( normal ) distribution , for which @xmath124 proceeding as before , we find @xmath125 which becomes identical to ( [ galpha_exp ] ) upon replacing @xmath111 by @xmath126 .",
    "we conclude that @xmath127 and @xmath128 for the gaussian case .",
    "although this does not constitute a strict proof , it strongly indicates that the behaviour @xmath129 is _ universal _ within this class of probability distributions .      as a representative of the weibull class of distributions with finite support we first consider the uniform distribution ( [ uniform ] ) .",
    "the integral on the right hand side of ( [ galpha ] ) can then be evaluated without approximating @xmath130 by @xmath131 , and one obtains @xmath132 this is a negative monotonically increasing function which vanishes quadratically in @xmath133 near @xmath134 , @xmath135 the evaluation of the record rate ( [ asym ] ) then yields @xmath136 \\approx \\sqrt { \\frac{\\alpha \\pi}{2 n}}\\ ] ] for large @xmath0 , and the number of records grows asymptotically as @xmath137 . the specific power is clearly related to the quadratic behaviour of @xmath103 near @xmath134 , which in turn reflects the behaviour of @xmath138 near the upper boundary @xmath139 .",
    "more generally we may consider bounded distributions of the form @xmath140 with @xmath141 and the uniform case corresponding to @xmath142 . to extract the leading order behaviour of @xmath103 for @xmath143 we write @xmath144 for @xmath143 .",
    "hence the record rate decays as @xmath145 and the mean number of records grows as @xmath146      the asymptotic laws ( [ r_frechet ] , [ mean_exp ] , [ weibull_mean ] ) were first discovered in simulations , and they have subsequently been numerically verified for a variety of parameter values . as an example , we show in figure [ figure1 ] numerical data for the mean number of records obtained for distributions in the gumbel class .",
    "there are significant corrections to the asymptotic behaviour for the gaussian distribution as well as for the exponentical distribution with @xmath147 .",
    "this is not surprising in view of the approximations used in the derivation of ( [ mean_exp ] ) ; for example , the last step in ( [ pn_exp2 ] ) requires that @xmath148 which is true only for enormously large values of @xmath0 .    ,",
    "@xmath92 and @xmath149 .",
    "the dashed line shows data obtained for the gaussian distribution and @xmath92 .",
    "the thin dotted line is the harmonic series ( [ harmonic ] ) which applies universally for @xmath150 .",
    "the short bold dotted lines show the predicted slope @xmath151 for the exponential case and @xmath111 in the gaussian case .",
    "all data were obtained from @xmath152 realizations of time series of length @xmath153.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]       simulations have also been used to investigate the occurrence of correlations in the record time process for @xmath20 .",
    "we have seen in section [ sec : iid ] that the poisson statistics of @xmath42 is a consequence of the fact that the record indicator variables @xmath31 are independent in the i.i.d . case . in particular , ( [ rn_variance ] ) shows that the variance of @xmath42 is asympotically equal to the mean whenever the @xmath31 are uncorrelated and the record rate @xmath5 tends to zero for @xmath45 in such a way that @xmath8 diverges .",
    "as this is true for @xmath20 in all cases that we have considered , the index of dispersion ( [ rho ] ) can be used as a probe for correlations .",
    "the data displayed in figure [ figure2 ] clearly show that the asymptotic value of @xmath46 is less than unity and independent of @xmath111 for the uniform distribution .",
    "similar results have been obtained for the exponential distribution , whereas we find that @xmath154 for the power law case .",
    "we conclude that , at least in certain cases , the record time process becomes more regular than the log - poisson process when the underlying distribution broadens with time .",
    ", 1/2 , 1 and 2 . while the data for @xmath150 approach the asymptotic poisson limit of unity according to ( [ rn_variance ] ) , the data for @xmath20 converge to a universal sub - poissonian value .",
    "the data were obtained from @xmath153 realizations of time series of length @xmath152.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "the main results of this paper are the asymptotic laws ( [ r_frechet ] , [ mean_exp ] , [ weibull_mean ] ) for the mean number of records in sequences of random variables drawn from broadening distributions . in all three cases",
    "the exponent @xmath111 governing the time dependence of the width of the distribution enters only in the prefactors and does not affect the functional form of the result . comparing the three cases , we see that the effect of the broadening on @xmath8 is stronger the faster the underlying distribution @xmath17 decays for large arguments : for fat - tailed power law distributions the number of records remains logarithmic , for exponential - like distributions it changes from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , while for distributions with bounded support the logarithm speeds up to a power law in time .    apart from the presentation of new results , a secondary purpose of this paper has been to advertise record dynamics as a paradigm of non - stationary point processes with interesting mathematical properties and wide - spread applications ranging from fundamental issues in the dynamics of complex systems to the consequences of climatic change . in the present work we have combined the intrinsic non - stationarity of record dynamics with an explicit non - stationarity of the underlying sequence of random variables .",
    "this turns out to be a relevant modification which may alter the basic logarithmic time - dependence of the mean number of records , and it can induce correlations among the record times , as detected in deviations of the index of dispersion ( [ rho ] ) from unity . it is worth noting that evidence for such correlations can also be found in recent applications of record dynamics in simulations of complex systems @xcite .",
    "an analytic understanding of the origin of correlations in the models presented here is clearly an important goal for the near future .",
