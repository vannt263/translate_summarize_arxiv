    "one of the major uncertainties in precise cosmology is the galaxy biasing relative to the underlying mass distribution .",
    "it hampers extracting the cosmological information from the large scale structure of the universe .",
    "in particular , the biasing is sensitive to the unknown physical conditions of galaxy formation .",
    "thus its phenomenological parametrization and understanding is crucial in advancing our knowledge of the evolution of the universe .",
    "a reasonable approximation often adopted is a local linear biasing model , which assumes a simple scale - independent relation between the density contrast fields of galaxy and mass : @xmath4 in the above , the density contrast of the mass is defined as @xmath5 where the over - bar indicates the mean over the entire universe .",
    "the number density contrast of galaxy density field , @xmath6 , is defined similarly . because this model contains only a single time - dependent parameter @xmath7 ,",
    "it is not surprising that the model can not describe the observed features of galaxy clustering accurately .",
    "furthermore , the three - point correlation function of sdss galaxies @xcite indicates the importance of the higher - order correction to equation ( [ eq : dg - d ] ) ; while the galaxy two - point correlation functions are well represented by the linear biasing model ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the normalized amplitudes @xmath3 of the corresponding three - point functions for equilateral triangles do not show the expected scaling with respect to @xmath7 : @xmath8 in reality , however , @xmath3 for equilateral triangles calculated from sdss galaxies in redshift space proves to be almost scale - independent , and follows the hierarchical relation approximately , @xmath9 .",
    "moreover its dependence on the morphology , color , and luminosity is not statistically significant . given the robust morphological , color and luminosity dependences of the two - point correlation function , @xcite argued that galaxy biasing is complex and requires a contrived relation between the linear biasing and its higher order correction terms .",
    "another possibility is that the observed value is significantly contaminated by the redshift - space distortion and does not properly reflect the actual clustering information in real space . indeed",
    "the previous n - body studies of the redshift - space distortion on three- and four - point correlation functions suggest that this is the case in nonlinear regimes @xcite .",
    "the interpretation is further complicated by the fact that the higher - order statistics is sensitive to relatively rare large - scale structures in particular samples @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to provide a physical explanation for the approximate hierarchical relation for @xmath3 of sdss galaxy clustering on the basis of perturbation analysis and numerical simulations .",
    "this is a step toward the understanding of the nonlinear nature of biasing .",
    "specifically we employ a local _ nonlinear _ biasing model @xcite : @xmath10^n .",
    "\\label{eq : db - d}\\ ] ] we consider density peaks , dark matter halos , simulated halos , and the sdss galaxies as specific examples for the density fields @xmath11 in the left hand side .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows ; section [ sec : am ] briefly summarizes the halo and peak biasing models as analytically tractable examples .",
    "we compute the linear and quadratic biasing coefficients perturbatively and find that these models roughly agree with the observed hierarchical relation . to be more realistic , we analyze simulated halo catalogs and sdss galaxies in section [ sec : simulation ] , and find that the perturbative result is valid even if we take account of a variety of selection effects and particularly redshift - space distortion .",
    "the quantitative agreement between the two indicates a generic correlation among the biasing coefficients in the sdss galaxies .",
    "finally , section [ sec : sd ] is devoted to the summary and conclusion of the paper .",
    "throughout the present analysis , we work in the fourier space . for definiteness , we adopt the definition of the fourier transform of an arbitrary function @xmath12 as @xmath13 then the power spectrum and the bispectrum of the mass density field are defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the dirac delta and we assume the universe is isotropic and homogeneous .",
    "we introduce the normalized amplitude of the mass bispectrum as @xmath16 note that strictly speaking , the above statistic is different from that defined in configuration space .",
    "since both are expected to be nearly identical in a weakly nonlinear regime , we focus on the fourier space analysis throughout this paper ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis in configuration space is now in progress .",
    "the above statistics can be generalized in a straightforward manner to any biased field .",
    "if one keeps the linear and quadratic terms in equation ( [ eq : db - d ] ) , one obtains @xmath17.\\label{eq : qb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , @xmath18 for the biased field is directly dependent on the quadratic biasing coefficient @xmath1 unlike in the case of the power spectrum . as we show below , this term plays an important role to approximately satisfy the hierarchical relation . in order to understand the qualitative relations among the biasing coefficients , we first consider analytically workable biasing models , i.e. , halo and peak biasing .",
    "we follow the formalism of @xcite for halo biasing .",
    "we define ( unconditional ) mass function , @xmath19 of halos with mass @xmath20 at redshift @xmath21 .",
    "we rewrite the unconditional mass function as @xmath22 we denote by @xmath23 the linearly extrapolated value of the rms of the initial density fluctuation field smoothed with a tophat filter of scale @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the mean comoving background density .",

    "there exist two popular models for @xmath34 .",
    "one is based on a spherical collapse model @xcite : @xmath35 the other is based on an ellipsoidal collapse model @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38^{-1}\\approx0.3222 $ ] , and @xmath39 @xcite .",

    "a reasonable approximation for @xmath46 is obtained by applying the extended press - schechter theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the linearly extrapolated mass density contrast at @xmath42 . if we define the actual density contrast @xmath49 , @xmath48 is written as @xmath50 where the above coefficients are obtained assuming the spherical collapse model @xcite .",
    "now one can write down the corresponding conditional density contrast of halos : @xmath51 expanding equation ( [ eq : dhalo - n ] ) in terms of @xmath52 in the limit of @xmath53 yields the biasing coefficients of halos @xcite : @xmath54 where @xmath55},\\qquad \\frac{e_2}{e_1 } = \\frac{1 + 2p}{\\delta_{\\rm sc}(z)}+2\\epsilon_1.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above results for ellipsoidal collapse reduce to those for spherical collapse , if one sets @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the biasing coefficients of the peak model can be obtained similarly as the halo model described in the above subsection .",

    "we simply distribute mock galaxies in the simulation cubes and do not consider the survey boundary effect , so the numbers of mock galaxy samples do not correspond to those of sdss galaxy samples .    according to the current hod approach , we evaluate the biasing coefficients in two ways .",

    "we note a few interesting features in the plot .",
    "i ) the similarity between the color selected and luminosity threshold samples .",
    "while they are based on different selection criteria , the resulting @xmath65  @xmath0 correlation seems to be roughly the same .",
    "ii ) the hod analytic prediction reproduces the values of @xmath65 and @xmath0 for each luminosity threshold galaxy samples .",
    "this is surprising since the fitting procedure is designed to reproduce their two - point correlation functions alone .",
    "iii ) the discrepancy between the hod mock and analytical results may come from the difference between sheth - tormen model and our halo samples in @xmath102 and/or @xmath1 .",
    "we made sure that @xmath102 of our halo samples is in good agreement with equation ( [ eq : st ] ) .",
    "on the other hand as the left panel of figure [ fig : b2b1_sim_ana ] indicates , @xmath1 for our simulated halos is systematically lower than the analytic prediction , equation ( [ eq : b_ave ] ) .",
    "thus the agreement between sdss data and hod models needs to be interpreted with caution .",
    "we also compute the values of @xmath65 and @xmath0 of hod mock galaxy samples in real space .",
    "we , however , do not plot the results , since they are almost the same as those in redshift space .",
    "even with the above subtlety we find a fairly generic correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath0 , which is the most important result of the current study .",
    "we note here that @xcite performed a related analysis using 2df galaxy data .",
    "they found that @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the right panel of figure [ fig : b2b1_sim_ana ] .",
    "incidentally they speculated a crude correlation of @xmath105 , which is indeed consistent with our finding on the basis of systematic results from analytic , and numerical simulations and sdss galaxy data .",
    "we have found a fairly generic correlation between linear and quadratic biasing coefficients , @xmath0 and @xmath65 , using a variety of different methodologies ; perturbative expansions of peak and halo biasing models , n - body simulations of halos , sdss galaxy data analysis , and the corresponding halo occupation distribution predictions ( analytic and mock ) .",
    "the presence of such correlations was suggested earlier by the previous finding that the normalized three - point correlation functions of sdss galaxies in redshift space follow the hierarchical relation approximately , @xmath9 , despite the robust morphological , color and luminosity dependences of the corresponding two - point correlation functions @xcite .",
    "we have derived the @xmath0 ",
    "@xmath1 correlation explicitly and showed for the first time that it indeed explains the observed behavior of @xmath3 for equilateral triangles calculated from sdss galaxies in linear regimes .      *",
    "even with the presence of redshift distortion and complicated survey shape effects , @xmath0 can be accurately estimated in @xmath2 .",
    "so @xmath0 estimated from sdss galaxies is expected to reflect the true value in real space . *",
    "the values of @xmath18 for equilateral triangles from simulated halos , mock galaxies based on hod model , and sdss galaxies do not show any clear dependence on @xmath0 .",
    "the independence on @xmath0 is not an artifact from the redshift - space distortion contamination , but is a consequence of the intrinsic correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath0 .",
    "* the hod model , equation ( [ eq : hod ] ) , whose parameters are determined so as to reproduce the observed two - point statistics alone , seems to be also successful in predicting the value of @xmath1 .",
    "there are a few remaining tasks which should be done following the present result .",
    "first , it is interesting to compare the current analysis in fourier space with that in configuration space .",
    "as long as nonlinear effect is negligible , @xmath74 and @xmath18 in k - space are expected to be the same as those in configuration space .",
    "nevertheless we would like to make sure of it , and to further explore the connection between bispectra and the three - point correlation functions of halos and galaxies .",
    "second , the success of hod to reproduce the correlation between @xmath65 and @xmath0 at the current level is very encouraging .",
    "naturally it is important to further improve the hod model .",
    "third , the present paper considers only equilateral configuration of fourier space triangles for @xmath3 . in reality , however , the different shape of triangles has a wealth of information . while the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath3 barely vanishes for equilateral triangles due to the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath65 ,",
    "this is not the case for arbitrary triangle shapes .",
    "therefore it is interesting to explore if the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath3 for the other triangle shapes and to see if the results are consistent with the present analysis and/or to constrain higher order biasing coefficients more tightly .",
