    "comprehensive reviews on baryon flux - tubes and hybrid baryons are available .",
    "@xcite here developments since the last review in 2002 are summarized .",
    "_ baryon flux - tube : _ the consensus in quenched lattice qcd is that the baryon potential at sufficient distances is best described by the sum of a coulomb , y - shaped confinement , and constant term .",
    "@xcite this statement is independent of the lattice operator , and hence physical .",
    "@xcite the difference with abelian projected full lattice qcd is small .",
    "@xcite the baryon flux action density  @xcite is displayed in fig .",
    "the density clearly peaks at the three quarks and the junction",
    ". however , the detailed contour lines , as well as the y - shape , are lattice operator dependent .",
    "@xcite abelian projected full lattice qcd shows  @xcite that cromo - electic flux flows in the same directions as the flux - tubes , with solenoidal currents circulating around them .",
    "this supports  @xcite the idea that qcd is a dual superconductor .    _",
    "hybrid baryon : _ the first quenched lattice qcd calculation of the low - lying hybrid baryon potential has been performed .",
    "@xcite the lowest gluonic excitation energy ( fig .",
    "[ tak ] ) is consistently greater than 1 gev .",
    "this is several hundred mev larger than the flux - tube model prediction  @xcite , which already gives the highest mass prediction for the lightest @xmath1 hybrid baryon of all the models  @xcite .",
    "if the lattice calculation is correct , this hybrid baryon will likely have a mass above 2 gev , which would mean that the hybrid baryon spectrum starts at a very high mass .",
    "in contrast to this , qcd sum rule predictions for hybrid baryon masses remain low : most recently , the @xmath2 is predicted  @xcite at @xmath3 gev .",
    "a possible reason why the lattice calculation is high is that the effect of higher excited states has not been eliminated , although it is stated  @xcite that this is not the case .    _",
    "hybrid baryon production in @xmath0 decay _ , a glue - rich process , has long been thought to be promising .",
    "@xcite particularly , bes at bepc can look for @xmath4 .",
    "recently , several high mass peaks have been reported  @xcite : a @xmath5 peak at @xmath6 mev seen in @xmath7 , and a @xmath8 mev peak seen in @xmath9 . a recent model calculation  @xcite finds , in contrast to nave expectations , that hybrids are very weakly produced relative to radially excited baryons in @xmath0 decay .",
    "this is due to a low probability of the gluon coming from the @xmath0 to fold in to the @xmath10 hybrid wavefunction , and color factors in the hybrid baryon wave function .",
    "in fact , it is suggested that @xmath0 decay is a filter in favor of conventional baryons .",
    "@xcite    _ hybrid baryon electro - production : _ a recent analysis of new jefferson lab data finds  @xcite that the amplitude for roper resonance ( @xmath11 ) production via longitudinal photons is substantial , inconsistent with a model prediction that it should be zero .",
    "the roper hence does not fit well as a hybrid baryon .",
    "when a baryon decays via ozi allowed quark - antiquark pair creation to a baryon and a meson , it has not hitherto been considered what happens to the flux - tubes .",
    "there is certainly an effect , as the pair is created from gluons .",
    "here we report on the first preliminary calculation .",
    "such a calculation exists for meson decay to two mesons .",
    "@xcite the structure of the decay can be investigated by fixing the initial quarks in the baryon , and evaluating the overlap of the initial flux configuration with the final baryon and mesons , for a fixed quark - antiquark pair created from the initial flux - tube : the `` flux - tube overlap '' .",
    "this quantity enters in models of baryon decay where it is traditionally assumed to be a constant .",
    "this is equivalent to taking the y - shaped flux structure to have no effect on decay .",
    "in such a picture the main effect of confinement on the decay is that it specifies the decay operator for quark - antiquark pair creation , e.g. the @xmath12 decay operator  @xcite .",
    "this operator is typically taken to act locally with no knowledge of the global y - shaped structure . here",
    "the concern is not with the local character of decay ( the decay operator ) , but with imposing constraints from y - shaped confinement ( the flux - tube overlap ) .",
    "the baryon decay flux overlap    @xmath13    measures the overlap of the flux - tube wavefunction of initial baryon a , with those of final baryon b and meson c , assuming that pair creation takes place at position @xmath14 .",
    "the overlap is evaluated analytically in the flux - tube model of isgur and paton  @xcite as was done for the meson case  @xcite . in this model the flux is represented by oscillating beads , and for the baryon the flux - tubes meet at a junction .",
    "the coordinates of the quarks and junction are displayed in fig .",
    "[ def](b ) .",
    "the position of the junction of the initial baryon , measured from its equilibrium position , is denoted by @xmath15 . in eq .",
    "[ defeq ] the position of bead @xmath16 associated with quark @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath18 . for the calculation shown , the constituent quark masses we taken to be 330 mev , the string tension that of mesons ( @xmath19 gev@xmath20 gev / fm ) ,  @xcite and all the bead masses equal .",
    "bead masses are fixed by the condition that their sum equals the potential energy in the flux - tubes when the system is in equilibrium .",
    "the flux - tube overlap @xmath21 depends on the six variables @xmath14 and @xmath22 , shown in fig .",
    "[ def](a ) .",
    "there is also dependence on the number of beads associated with each flux - tube in the initial baryon ( @xmath23 ) . if pair creation can take place on more than one bead , @xmath21 is the sum of the possible overlaps .",
    "( hence the sum over the number of beads on the final meson @xmath24 in eq .",
    "[ defeq ] . ) without loss of generality pair creation associated with the flux - tube of the third quark is studied .",
    "the components of @xmath14 perpendicular to the vector @xmath25 are @xmath26 ( in the three - quark plane ) and @xmath27 ( perpendicular to the three - quark plane ) .",
    "the component of @xmath14 along @xmath25 is @xmath28 .",
    "when any variables are fixed in the figures , the following choices are made , unless indicated otherwise : @xmath29 , @xmath30 gev@xmath31 fm , @xmath32 gev@xmath33 fm and @xmath34 .    ,    the dependence of @xmath21 on the pair creation position @xmath14 is as follows .",
    "the dependence on @xmath26 and @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "[ gauss ] . a clear gaussian fall - off with flattened top with a diameter @xmath35 fm think can be seen .",
    "this follows closely what would be expected for a thick flux - tube which falls off away from @xmath25 as predicted by the flux - tube model ( see fig . 2 of ref .",
    "the gaussian fall - off with flattened top continues to be observed as @xmath28 is varied .",
    "[ bump](a ) shows the dependence on @xmath28 .",
    "the asymmetric shape is because pair creation can take place beyond the position of the third quark ( @xmath36 gev@xmath37 ) .",
    "vanishing pair creation at @xmath38 * 0 * is an artifact of the small - oscillations approximation  @xcite made in this calculation , and is _ not _ a prediction of the flux - tube model .",
    "the dependence of @xmath21 on quark position @xmath22 variations is shown in figs .",
    "[ bump](b ) and [ ldep ] .",
    "the extremes of the variation are consistently ( a ) smallest @xmath21 when @xmath39 ( red line @xmath40 ) , and ( b ) largest @xmath21 when @xmath41 ( blue line @xmath42 ) .",
    "these extremes are easily understood intuitively : when @xmath43 is small / large , there is less / more opportunity for pair creation associated with the third quark .",
    "[ bump](b ) shows that pair creation becomes more confined to the region inside the third quark ( @xmath44 ) as @xmath43 increases .",
    "there is also a dependence on the number of beads @xmath23 .",
    "calculations were also performed for @xmath45 .",
    "the number of beads determine the inter - bead spacing , a regularization parameter , which is unphysical .",
    "the qualitative features of the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath14 and @xmath22 discussed above are independent of @xmath23 , and hence physical .",
    "they are also without exception what one would have expected before the calculation was performed .",
    "the overall magnitude of decay is strongly dependent on @xmath23 , and hence unphysical .",
    "this is as expected , since the magnitude of decay is normalized to phenomenology in pair creation models .    ,    ,",
    "_ baryon : _ at sufficient distances the potential is y - shaped with a clear junction .",
    "the decay flux - tube overlap has been evaluated in the flux - tube model , and follows nave expectations .",
