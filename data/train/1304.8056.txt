    "in recent years two dimensional ( 2d ) materials have attracted a growing interest due to their potential for future nano - electronics applications , owing to their unusual physical , optical and electrical properties arising from the quantum confinement associated to their ultra thin structure  @xcite .",
    "these considerations apply particularly well to layered transition metal di - chalcogenides ( ltmds ) in which a multitude of electronic states have been observed , namely metallicity , semi - conductivity and charge density waves . given the richness in the electronic properties it is not a surprise that this materials class has been called out as the ideal platform for a multitude of applications  @xcite .",
    "for example , the prototypical ltmd , molybdenum di - sulfide mos@xmath0 , has been widely explored as lubricant  @xcite , catalyst  @xcite and as lithium ion battery anode  @xcite .",
    "structurally mos@xmath0 consists of covalently bonded s - mo - s 2d hexagonal planes ( monolayers ) , which in the bulk are bound together in a layered structure by weak van der waals forces  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the electronic properties of bulk mos@xmath0 show a strong dependence on the layer thickness  @xcite .",
    "single mos@xmath0 monolayers are particularly intriguing .",
    "these display a direct band - gap of 1.9  ev , which makes them a semiconducting alternative to gapless graphene .",
    "indeed the band - gap of graphene can be opened by fabricating nanoribbons  @xcite or by depositing it over a suitable substrate  @xcite .",
    "however this comes at the cost of deteriorating the carrier mobility due to edge and impurity scattering  @xcite . in contrast",
    ", the absence of dangling bonds , the high crystallinity , and the low dimensionality , make the performance of ltmds comparable to those of currently existing si transistors at the scaling limit  @xcite .",
    "mos@xmath0 monolayer based transistors have been recently demonstrated to operate at room temperature , with a mobility of at least 200 @xmath1/vs and on / off current ratios of 10@xmath2 with low standby power dissipation  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , both n - type  @xcite and p - type  @xcite conductivities have been reported for ultra - thin mos@xmath0 layers , depending on the experimental details .",
    "the origin of such diverse conducting properties remains to date far from being clear .",
    "the possible creation of mo and/or s vacancies in mos@xmath0 monolayers during the growth can not be used as a doping strategy , since those vacancies always produce deep trap states in the mos@xmath0 monolayer band - gap  @xcite . in a recent study",
    "we have investigated how unintentional doping of the substrate holding a mos@xmath0 monolayer may determine its conductivity  @xcite . here",
    "we explore possible strategies for doping directly into the mos@xmath0 monolayer . although there are studies available on specific dopants for single layer mos@xmath0 @xcite , to our knowledge there is not yet a systematic investigation comparing the doping properties of the various defects , when they are incorporated in either a substitutional position or they are adsorbed on the surface . moreover , it has been reported that in a liquid - gated electric double layer transistor , the ions can modulate the electronic properties from insulating to metallic through electrostatic induced carrier doping in the transport channel at a finite gate bias  @xcite . compared with other dopants , such as metals and light atoms ,",
    "ionic liquids have several advantages as surface dopants : a large variety of such ionic complexes are available , they can accumulate more carriers than conventional solid state gated transistors , and they do not induce structural disorder like substitutional dopants .",
    "in fact , ambipolar transistor operation has been achieved using thin flakes of mos@xmath0 in an ionic liquid gated environment  @xcite .",
    "the present work explores also this possibility .",
    "here we systematically study the effects of dopants on the electronic structure of a mos@xmath0 monolayer , by calculating the formation energies and the electronic properties of halogens , non - metals , transition metals and alkali metals added in various geometrical configurations .",
    "our aim is that of identifying potential candidates for making mos@xmath0 monolayers either n- or p - type in a controlled way",
    ". then we present an investigation of the electronic structure of mos@xmath0 monolayers when two molecular ions , nh@xmath3 and bf@xmath4 , are adsorbed at the surface .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . after a brief discussion of the computational methods used",
    "we turn our attention to the case of substitutional doping by looking at both at the s and the mo site .",
    "next we consider the case of doping by adsorption of alkali and molecular ions . at the end of the results section we briefly discuss the robustness of our calculations against the particular choice of exchange and correlation functional and",
    "finally we conclude .",
    "in order to investigate the electronic properties of a mos@xmath0 monolayer doped with impurities , _ ab - initio _ calculations are performed using density functional theory  @xcite within the local spin density approximation ( dft - lsda ) for the exchange and correlation potential .",
    "in particular we consider the ceperly - alder lsda parametrization  @xcite as implemented in the siesta code  @xcite . in our calculations double-@xmath5",
    "polarized  @xcite numerical atomic orbitals basis sets are used for all atoms , and the troullier - martins scheme is used for constructing norm - conserving pseudopotentials  @xcite . a 5@xmath65 hexagonal supercell [ see fig .  [",
    "fig : impuritycell](a ) ] with ( 15.66@xmath615.66 )  @xmath7 lateral dimensions is constructed and doping is introduced by replacing / adding a single atom in the supercell .",
    "this corresponds to simulating a mo@xmath8a@xmath9s@xmath10b@xmath11 periodic system with @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) when the doping is at the mo ( s ) site .",
    "an equivalent plane wave cutoff of 250  ry is used for the real space mesh and the brillouin zone is sampled over a 5@xmath65@xmath61 monkhorst - pack @xmath14-grid .",
    "periodic boundary conditions are applied and a vacuum layer of at least 15  is placed above the monolayer to minimize the interaction between the adjacent periodic images . a temperature of 300 k is used when populating the electronic states with a fermi distribution .",
    "the relaxed geometries are obtained by conjugate gradient , where all the atoms in the supercell are allowed to relax until any force is smaller than 0.02 ev /  .    in order to verify that the calculated impurity level alignments are robust against the choice of exchange correlation functional , we repeat the calculations for the main results by using the screened hybrid functional of heyd - scuseria - ernzerhof ( hse06 ) @xcite . all dft calculations based on the hse06 functional are carried out with the projector augmented wave ( paw ) pseudo potential plane - wave method@xcite as implemented in the vasp code @xcite . a 3@xmath63@xmath61 monkhorst - pack@xcite @xmath14-point grid is employed and the plane wave energy cutoff is 500  ev .",
    "the formation energy of a particular substitutional dopant , @xmath15 , is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17(mos@xmath18+x ) is the total energy of the system including the substitutional atom x , @xmath17(mos@xmath0 ) is the total energy of the corresponding pristine mos@xmath0 monolayer , while @xmath19(x ) and @xmath19(host ) are respectively the energies of the substitutional atom x and of the substituted mo ( s ) host atom in their bulk ( diatomic molecule ) forms . in contrast the formation energy for an adsorbate , @xmath20 , can be written as @xmath21 where @xmath17(mos@xmath0+y ) refers to the total energy when the adsorbate y is attached to mos@xmath0 , and @xmath19(y ) is the energy of an adsorbate y in its bulk form . in order to find the most stable configuration for adsorption , we consider four possible positions labeled as follows : t@xmath22 ( adsorbate on top of s ) , t@xmath23 ( adsorbate on top of mo ) , a ( adsorbate above the center of the hexagonal ring of mos@xmath0 ) , and b ( adsorbate above the middle of the mo - s bond ) [ see fig .

    "light gray spheres indicate mo atoms , light yellow spheres indicate s.,width=302 ]",
    "before discussing the formation energy and the electronic structure of the possible dopants let us here briefly review the electronic properties of a single mos@xmath0 monolayer . as the mos@xmath0 thickness is decreased from bulk to a few layers , the valence band minimum shifts from half way along @xmath24-k line towards k  @xcite . for a monolayer",
    "the band - gap becomes direct at k ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:1l_band_pdos ] ) , a transition which has been recently observed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the computed lsda band - gap of 1.86  ev is in good agreement with the experimental optical band - gap of 1.90 ev  @xcite , although such an agreement has to be considered fortuitous .",
    "in fact the absorption edge of an optical excitation measures the energy difference between the quasi - particle band - gap and the exciton binding energy . in mos@xmath0 monolayers",
    "this latter is of the order of 1  ev , as confirmed recently by many - body calculations  @xcite .",
    "thus , one expects that the true quasi - particle spectrum has a band - gap of approximately 2.9  ev , in good agreement with that computed with the @xmath25 scheme , either at the first order level  @xcite ( 2.82  ev ) or self - consistently  @xcite ( 2.76  ev ) . at the end of this section",
    "we will discuss how band - gap corrections , via the hse06 functional , affect our main results . in any case , for both bulk and monolayer the band - structure around the band - gap is derived mainly from mo-4@xmath26 orbitals ( see the orbital projected density of state , pdos , in fig .",
    "[ fig:1l_band_pdos ] ) , although there are also small contributions in the valence band from the s-3@xmath27 ones .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we start by considering cs adsorption .",
    "when cs is adsorbed on a mos@xmath0 monolayer there is no significant change in the geometry , i.e. the ion binds without distorting the lattice of the host .",
    "the dos presented in fig .  [ fig : pdos_absorb_atom](a ) shows that the available cs 6@xmath29 electron is transferred to the cbm of the mos@xmath0 monolayer , occupying the mo-4@xmath26 orbitals . in this case",
    "there is no split off at the bottom of the conduction band and the dos projected over the cs 6@xmath29 orbitals appears uniformly spread over a 1.5  ev energy window .",
    "this essentially means that cs adsorbed over a mos@xmath0 monolayer acts as perfect donor .",
    "a very similar situation is found for both k and li , with only minor quantitative differences in the spread of the dos associated with the @xmath29 shell of the dopant [ see fig.[fig : pdos_absorb_atom](b ) and fig.[fig : pdos_absorb_atom](c ) ] .",
    "in contrast , the adsorption of h produces a spin - split state 1  ev below the cbm , i.e. roughly at midgap of the lsda band - gap [ see fig.[fig : pdos_absorb_atom ] ] . as such",
    "we conclude that h is not a shallow donor for mos@xmath0 , in good agreement with the recent theoretical results  @xcite .",

    "the blue dashed line indicates the fermi energy , @xmath30 , the colored curves indicate the dos projected on the dopants.,width=302 ]    the pairing energies between two cs atoms and between nb and cs are given in table  [ pairing ] .",
    "our total energy calculations suggest that pairing between cs atoms is not energetically favorable . on the other hand cs atoms",
    "can reduce their energy if they are adsorbed close to a nb atom rather than on top of a mo atom .",
    "this can be easily explained with the electrostatic attraction between the two oppositely charged defects .",
    "this case of co - doping with cs and nb is particularly interesting , since it can be used as a strategy for fabricating p - n junctions , or more generally devices that require both n - type and p - type conductivity .",
    "importantly the dos of a supercell where a mo - substitutional nb impurity is bonded to a cs adatom appears essentially identical to that of an undoped mos@xmath0 monolayer ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : pdos_nb_cs ] ) , indicating that charge compensation is very effective . as a consequence",
    "our results suggest that an effective strategy for creating p - n hetero - junctions must prevent the formation of cs - nb bonding by suppressing the migration of cs on the surface .    in summary we find that adsorbed alkali metals release their valance @xmath29 electron to the mos@xmath0 conduction band , and that the adsorption energies are large and negative , meaning that the doping will occur easily . therefore , adsorbed alkali metals , with the exception of h , appear as ideal candidates for doping n - type mos@xmath0 . to put this result in context",
    "we remark that various experimental studies have demonstrated the possibility of dope n - type bulk mos@xmath0 by intercalating alkali metals @xcite . here",
    "we demonstrate that the same is also possible at the single layer level .",
    "electric double layer ( edl ) transistors with ionic liquids ( ils ) employed as gate dielectrics have recently emerged as promising devices , where the electrical properties of a solid can be controlled by electrostatic carrier doping @xcite . a schematic diagram for such a device is shown in fig .",

    "the accumulation of high charge carrier densities is possible ( @xmath3110@xmath32 @xmath33 ) and this can be modulated by the applied gate voltage . in some case the accumulation can be so large to lead to phase transitions in the solid .",

    "liquids are experimentally available . here",
    "we consider nh@xmath3 as cation and bf@xmath4 as anion , and we place them on the @xmath36 mos@xmath0 supercell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : adsorb_ion ] ) .",
    "such geometry corresponds to an impurity density of @xmath3110@xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "we find that the most energetically favorable adsorption site is t@xmath22 for the cation and t@xmath23 for the anion . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos_absorb_ion](a ) the dos is shown for nh@xmath37 adsorption .",
    "it can be seen that the nh@xmath37 releases one electron into the mos@xmath0 conduction band , resulting in a n - type mos@xmath0 monolayer channel .",
    "in contrast , when bf@xmath37 is adsorbed , one electron is transferred from mos@xmath0 to the molecule [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : pdos_absorb_ion](b ) ] . as a consequence the fermi energy shifts below the mos@xmath0 vbm , so that the system becomes p - type .",
    "this also confirms the fact that the adsorbed molecules are indeed ionized to nh@xmath3 and bf@xmath4 when put on mos@xmath0 . in a liquid gated transistor arrangement ,",
    "the anions / cations are brought close to the surface of the channel by applying a bias at the gate . therefore , for this system , depending on the polarity of the gate bias the mos@xmath0 is indeed predicted to have a n- or p - type conducting channel .",
    "clearly this effect is maximized for a single layer of mos@xmath0 when compared to thicker structures .",
    "in fact , conductivity measurements  @xcite on mos@xmath0 show that edl gating becomes less efficient when going from a thin layer to bulk .",
    "moreover , depending on the polarity of the bias , it is found that the conductivity indeed switches from n - type to p - type .",
    "finally , in order to verify that the impurity level alignment presented in the previous sections is robust against the level of approximation taken for the dft exchange - correlation energy , we here repeat our calculations by using the hse06 functional .",
    "the mos@xmath0 lattice constant obtained with hse06 is 3.155   , which is only slightly larger than the lsda value of 3.137   . for a pristine mos@xmath0 monolayer at this relaxed lattice",
    "constant hse06 exhibits a direct band - gap of 2.2  ev ( compared to a lda band - gap of 1.86  ev ) .",
    "this is rather similar to the band - gap obtained by applying the atomic self - interaction correction scheme  @xcite .    ,",
    "calculated with the hse06 functional .",
    "we report results for ( a ) nb substitutional at the mo site , and for ( b ) cs , ( c ) nh@xmath3 and ( d ) bf@xmath4 adsorbed on the mos@xmath0 surface .",
    "the blue dashed line indicates the fermi energy ( @xmath30 ) , the colored shaded areas indicate the dos projected on the adsorbates . in the plot",
    "we have aligned all the conduction and valence bands.,width=302 ]    in fig .  [",
    "fig : pdos_hse ] we report our results for four representative doping strategies , namely for nb substitutional doping , as well as for cs , nh@xmath37 and bf@xmath37 adsorption .",
    "these correspond to the most promising dopants for either n - type or p - type doping as obtained at the lsda level .",
    "the calculations are carried out with the same structures used in the previous sections , in order to make a direct comparison between results obtained with the two functionals used .",
    "we note , however , that the mos@xmath0 band - gap is very sensitive to changes in the lattice constant  @xcite , so that the hse06 band - gap at the lsda lattice constant of 3.137     becomes 2.31  ev .",
    "we find that for all the four cases the main difference between the lsda and the hse06 results is just a change in the band - gap , while the impurity levels with respect to the relative fermi energy are placed at the same position .",
    "therefore we can conclude that the four most promising candidates for doping mos@xmath0 monolayers remain those identified by our initial lsda analysis .",
    "we have carried out a systematic study on the changes to the electronic structure of a mos@xmath0 monolayer induced by various dopants .",
    "this study has the aim of identifying possible doping strategies for mos@xmath0 monolayers to be used in devices manufacturing .",
    "we have considered first substitutional doping at both the mo and the s site , as well as doping by adsorption . in general , s substitution with non - metals and mo substitution with transition metals create deep donor levels inside the band - gap of the mos@xmath0 monolayer for most of the dopants considered . however , with substitutional doping we find that it is possible to obtain p - type mos@xmath0 by replacing a mo atom with nb .",
    "in contrast n - type doping does not appear possible since we have found deep donor levels for all the substitutions investigated ( either at the mo or the s site ) .",
    "more promising n - type doping can be achieved by adsorbing alkali metals on the surface of mos@xmath0 . finally , as a last class of dopants",
    ", we have considered the adsorption of ionic molecules , which occurs during the electric double layer formation in mos@xmath0 embedded in an ionic liquid .",
    "these show high potential for inducing large carrier concentrations within the mos@xmath0 monolayer , in the form of both electrons or holes .",
