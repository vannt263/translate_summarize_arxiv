    "scattering of electromagnetic waves from multilayer structures is a phenomenon which is of interest in many area of physics such as remote sensing or optical industry , where for example metallic surfaces have a dielectric coating .",
    "an extended review of experimental and theoretical works on optical multilayers can be found in @xcite , and references on recent papers are given in @xcite .",
    "many works @xcite deal with the small perturbation method to investigate the behaviour of multilayer structure .",
    "however , due to calculations complexity , the analytical results are given only to first order in the rms - height of each rough boundary , thus the interaction between the rough surfaces can only be taken into account if the rough surfaces are correlated @xcite in the mean procedure .",
    "our purpose is to show how light can interact with several rough surfaces , to this end , we have choosen the most simple system depicted in fig",
    ".  [ systeme0 ] , where we have three regions with different permitivities separated by two rough surfaces .",
    "the calculations have been made under the hypothesis of the small perturbation method , initially developped by rice@xcite .",
    "due to the great complexity to derive high orders of the perturbative development , rice s original method is rather difficult to apply .",
    "one way to overcome these difficulties is to use integral equations called the reduced rayleigh equations , they were first obtained by celli _",
    "et al _ @xcite , and later have been generalized in ref .",
    "@xcite to take into account upward fields in the slab medium .",
    "when combining these equations we obtain an integral equation where only the scattering matrix of the whole structure has to be determined , next we have developed a systematic method to calculate the perturbative development .",
    "we have shown by means of numerical simulations , how different mechanisms responsible of the enhanced backscattering occur .",
    "this phenomenon which has been predicted @xcite and observed @xcite in the case of a random metal surface , manifests itself as a well - defined peak in the retroreflection direction through the angular dependence of the intensity related to the diffuse component of the scattered field . for a metallic surface ,",
    "the phenomenon is produced by the interference of waves which excite surface plasmon polariton along a certain path and then follow the same path but in the reverse direction . for a dielectric bounded by metallic plate with one rough surface @xcite ,",
    "the enhanced backscattering is produced by a similar mechanism where the surface plasmon polariton is replaced by a slab guided wave . in this case",
    "the incident wave excites in a first time a guided mode due to surface roughness , and then the roughness transforms the surface wave into a bulk wave .",
    "furthermore , if the slab supports several guided modes , recent investigations @xcite have shown the presence of additionnal peaks , called _ satellite peaks _ , in the angular distribution of the incoherent intensity .",
    "when the slab has two rough boundaries , the enhancement of backscattering can be produced by two kinds of interaction .",
    "the classic one , where the wave is scattered two times by the same boundary , and a new one ( see fig .  [ systeme0 ] ) where the wave is transmitted at a point @xmath0 of the surface without being diffused , then the wave is scattered by the second rough surface at a point @xmath1 and by the first one in @xmath2 .",
    "if the wave follows the same path in the reverse direction and excites the same guided mode , then phase difference between the two path is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the distance between @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "thus , in the anti - specular direction ( @xmath5 ) , this phase difference is independent of the random position of @xmath1 and @xmath2 which produce the backscattering peak .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ random ] we present the system under study and a description of the rough surfaces statistics . in section  [ scattering ]",
    "we define the plane wave representation of the electric field in the polarization basis and also the scattering matrix .",
    "section  [ diffuse ] is devoted to the calculation of the incoherent cross - section as a function of the perturbative development . in section  [ perturbative ]",
    "we derive an integral equation from the reduced rayleigh equations , which provides a systematic way to obtain the perturbative development .",
    "the resulting expressions are numerically computed in the case of a dielectric slab deposited on a rough silver surface in section  [ numerical ] .",
    "the calculated incoherent intensity will show a narrow enhanced backscattering .",
    "conclusions drawn from our results are presented and discussed in section  [ conclusions ] . in an appendix",
    ", we collect matrices used in the calculations .",
    "the system which is considered in this paper is depicted in fig .",
    "[ systeme ] .",
    "the three regions are characterized by an isotropic , homogeous dielectric constant @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 respectively .",
    "the two boundaries are located at @xmath9 and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and these three media are separated by rough surfaces described statistically .",
    "in fact , we assume that @xmath12 and @xmath13 are stationary , isotropic uncorrelated gaussian random processes defined by their moments :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , and the angle brackets denote an average over the ensemble of realizations of the function @xmath16 and @xmath17 . in this work",
    "we will use a gaussian form for the surface - height correlation function @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the rms height of the surface @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the transverse correlation length . in momentum space",

    "in a previous work  @xcite we have defined a new product @xmath52 between two dimensional matrices in the form : @xmath53 which allows to write the incoherent muller matrix @xcite in a condensed expression : @xmath54\\ , .",

    "we are interested by the perturbative development of the scattered fields as a function of the surface elevations @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in a perturbative expansion of the scattering matrix ,",
    "the terms which contain an expression like @xmath59 will be denoted @xmath60 , so that the perturbative development of @xmath61 becomes : @xmath62 with this decomposition and using eqs .",

    "if the value of @xmath67 and @xmath70 are of the same order of magnitude , these terms will be comparable to the order four in the expressions ( [ gau],[gad ] ) .",

    "[ normale ] , the wave is normally incident and the scattered field is observed in the incident plane ( @xmath145 ) .",
    "the single scattering contribution on each surface , associated with the terms @xmath146 , is plotted as a dotted line , the double - scattering contribution @xmath147 as a dashed line , the other terms @xmath148 as a dash - dotted line , and the total contribution @xmath149 by the solid curve .",
    "we observed an enhancement of the backscattering which corresponds to the physical process in which the incident light excites a guided - mode through the roughness of the slab and then is scattered into a volume wave which is also due to the roughness effect . during the same process , the light can follow this path in the opposite direction where one possible configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ systeme0 ] .",
    "these two paths can interfere constructively near the backscattering direction to produce a peak . as these paths are identical for the two waves under consideration",
    ", they should have the same degree of interaction with the rough surface , thus a term like @xmath150 can not produce the peak because the first wave interact three times with the upper rough surface while the second wave only one time .",
    "the effect comes only from the terms @xmath147 , which contain the paths indicated in fig .",
    "[ systeme0 ] . however , it has to be noticed that these terms contain also paths that do not produce enhanced backscattering , for example in @xmath151 we have the scattering process where the incident wave is only scattered one time by the upper rough surface but the scattering process is of order two in @xmath57 .",
    "this is the reason why the terms @xmath147 are not zero away from the anti - specular direction . in order to separate the different contributions to the backscattering peak",
    ", we have drawn the contributions of @xmath151 , @xmath152 , @xmath153 separately in fig .",
    "[ normale22 ] as a dashed - line , dotted - line and solid curve respectively , we see that each term produces an enhancement near the anti - specular direction .",
    "the terms @xmath151 , @xmath152 are the classic one(see refs .",
    "@xcite ) where the fields do not interact with both rough surfaces but produce the peak due to the scattering on the same rough surface : the upper one for @xmath151 and the bottom one for @xmath152 .",
    "the contribution @xmath153 is _ the new result _ of this work , because we see that the mechanism of fig .",
    "[ systeme0 ] exists and has the same magnitude as the other terms for the choosen parameters . in order to clearly show the displacement of the backscattering enhancement as the angle of incidence",
    "is varied , we show in figs .",
    "[ inc20 ] and [ inc2022 ] the numerical results of the perturbation method when @xmath154 .",
    "as expected , we clearly see the peak which is now located at @xmath155 .",
    "recent papers @xcite have also explored the satellite peaks phenomenon which occurs when the wave follows two reverse paths but with different guided - mode excitations . in fig",
    ".  [ normale22 ] , this phenomenon appears for the @xmath35 to @xmath35 polarization due to the term @xmath152 .",
    "although a similar phenomenon occurs for the other terms it is too weak to contribute significantly ..",
    "in conclusion , the results in this paper clearly show that the backscattering enhancement produced by a rough slab due to the guided - wave polaritons has several origin . at small order in the perturbative development ,",
    "the peak is produced by a double scattering mechanism .",
    "the new results we would like to emphasize , is that not only processes where the two scattering events take place on the same rough surface are capable to produce the backscattering peak , but it is also due to the fact that the wave can be scattered first by one of the rough surface and second by the other surface . to carry the proof ,",
    "we have performed a perturbative development up to order four in the rms - height of the surfaces which has been possible using an integral equation called reduced rayleigh equation , in which only the scattering matrix of the whole structure is unknown .",
