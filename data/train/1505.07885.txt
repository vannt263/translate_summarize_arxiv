    "the past decade has been a period of extraordinary discoveries in the field of exoplanets  @xcite . for the first time , we now have quantitative estimates for occurrence rates of different types of planets in our galaxy .",
    "a recent study by @xcite that focused on planets with periods up to 100 days in the kepler sample demonstrates the prevalence of neptune and sub - neptune exoplanets . in this sample ,",
    "the planets with a radius larger than 1.5 earth radii have a mean density  @xcite that implies that they are composed of both heavy elements ( rocks and ices ) as well as gas ( hydrogen and helium ) ( for mass - radius relation , see @xcite ) . despite the absence of sub - neptune planets in our solar system",
    ", we may be able to place constraints on the formation process of ice giants by studying the interior and the evolution of uranus and neptune .",
    "both planets have sizable gaseous envelopes surrounding cores composed of heavier elements .",
    "the core accretion model  @xcite suggests that the giant planets form in two distinct phases .",
    "first rocky and icy planetesimals accumulate to form a dense core .",
    "once a critical core mass has been reached , a runaway accretion of hydrogen - helium gas sets in and lasts until all gas from the planet s neighborhood has been depleted .",
    "most often it has been assumed that very little gas is present when the initial core forms  @xcite .",
    "because of this assumption , planetary interior models typically assume a dense core of rock and ice with a sharp transition to a gaseous outer envelope that is composed of hydrogen , helium , and a small fraction of heavier elements   @xcite .",
    "while the heavier element fraction in jupiter s envelope has been measured _ in situ _ by the galileo entry probe @xcite , there is no direct measurement that characterizes the state of a giant planet core .",
    "it is thus plausible that some mixing of gas and icy planetesimals has occurred when a giant planet formed and that it may have persisted until today .",
    "the mean density of uranus and neptune , on the other hand , suggests that they have a much higher fraction of heavy elements than jupiter and saturn @xcite .",
    "based on cosmological abundances , it is assumed that water is among the dominant species , followed by methane and amonia , even though only trace amounts of it have been detected spectroscopically in the atmospheres of uranus and neptune @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on water - hydrogen mixtures because of the prevalence of water in our solar system and the possibility that gases and ices mix when giant planets form .",
    "a recent study @xcite focused on the late accretion of planetesimals when a large , gaseous envelope is present .",
    "it was predicted that even large planetesimals of 100 km in diameter may disintegrate upon entry and the material would be distributed throughout the gas envelope . depending on the mixing properties of hydrogen and heavier elements , this material may either remain in the envelope or gradually settle onto the existing core .",
    "we will study hydrogen - water mixture in this article because little information is available about how well hydrogen mixes with other elements at high pressure .",
    "the phase separation of hydrogen and helium has been predicted to occur in the interiors of saturn  @xcite and also of jupiter  @xcite .",
    "the resulting release of gravitational energy has been named as a reason for the observed excess in saturn s luminosity .",
    "it would be of interest to know whether a similar process involving the separation of water - hydrogen mixtures could operate in the interiors of ice giant planets . if a phase separation occurs , the envelope would be progressively depleted of heavy elements , which affects the interior structure and the luminosity of a giant planet .    on the contrary , it is possible that the core of an initially differentiated planet would dissolve into the surrounding layer of hot , dense hydrogen .",
    "results from recent _ ab initio _ simulations predict that the rocky and icy components of the cores in jupiter and saturn are miscible in metallic hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "while a mixture state is thermodynamically preferred , it is not known how fast the cores of giant planets erode because gravitational forces counteract the advection of heavy elements .",
    "this may give rise to a semi - convective regime that has already been suggested to occur in the gas giant interiors @xcite .",
    "using recent updates of the gravitational moments of uranus and neptune @xcite , revised interior models have been constructed .",
    "@xcite fitted a density profile to these data and showed that they could be satisfied by a single layer of hydrogen and helium with a compositional gradient of heavier elements .",
    "on the other hand , @xcite matched the available constraints by constructing a typical three layers model assuming a rocky core , surrounded by an intermediate layer of water in a liquid or superionic state @xcite , and a gaseous outer envelope .",
    "while helled s model assumes water and hydrogen are completely miscible throughout the planet interior , nettelmann _ et al .",
    "_  conversely assume both fluids would not mix at the interface of the two layers at approximately 10  gpa and 2000  k. this underlines why the mixing properties of water and hydrogen are important for giant planet interiors .",
    "both aforementioned models assume an adiabatic , fully convective behavior for each layer .",
    "this assumption is not consistent with the observed luminosity of uranus  @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested a stably stratified interior model instead .",
    "nevertheless , a convective layer of a conducting material is needed to sustain a magnetic dynamo and to produce the quadrupolar fields observed for uranus and neptune @xcite .",
    "water is assumed to be the dominant species in the layer where magnetic fields of ice giant planets are generated .",
    "if water and hydrogen mix , a gradient of composition may be introduced into the planet s interior during formation .",
    "it would thus be possible for semi - convection to operate in ice giant planets which would reduce the overall heat flux and allow for a vigorous convection in some layers .",
    "some experimental data for water - hydrogen mixtures are available .",
    "@xcite studied mixtures up to 0.25  gpa and observed a phase separation below 650  k. based on this result , the presence of water clouds in the deep atmosphere of the ice giants has been inferred @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite investigated the properties of water - hydrogen in the presence of minerals under deep - earth conditions up to 2.5  gpa .",
    "hydrogen was released due to chemical reactions between water and the minerals .",
    "the analysis of micro - inclusions of fluid within the minerals showed that phase separation of hydrogen and water was possible at temperatures below 1200  k. these findings favor differentiated interior models for uranus and neptune .    at the present time , no experimental data are available for higher pressure and temperature but materials under such conditions can be studied efficiently with the _ ab initio _",
    "simulations that we used throughout this paper .",
    "results from such simulations have been shown to agree very well with shock wave measurements for hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "similarly results of shock wave experiments of water have been matched with _ ab initio _",
    "simulations  @xcite .",
    "recently improvements have been made to compute the dielectric constant of water with such methods  @xcite .",
    "here we use the same technique to study water - hydrogen mixtures from 2  gpa to 70  gpa and from 1000  k to 6000  k. for various mixing ratios , we compute the equation of state , in particular the pressure and internal energy as function of density and temperature .",
    "in addition we derive the gibbs free energy of mixing by performing a thermodynamic integration .",
    "we show that the mixtures behave close to an ideal mixture .",
    "the entropy of mixing is the dominant term in the gibbs free energy of mixing indicating that no phase separation occurs at all conditions under consideration .",

    "we also analyze changes in ionic species that are present in the mixture as a function of the pressure and the temperature .",
    "finally we comment on some implications of computed miscibility properties .",
    "we show for instance that a sharp transition from a hydrogen - rich envelope to a water - rich phase is thermodynamically unstable and that a three layer picture for the icy giants is a simplification .",
    "furthermore we compare the mass - radius relationship for neptune - like and sub - neptune planets depending on their differentiation .",
    "we found that for given radius and mass , a fully differentiated planet has a much lower hydrogen content than a homogeneously mixed planet .",
    "our investigations of the hydrogen - water mixture rely on _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations in which the nuclei are treated as classical particles while the electrons are considered quantum mechanically using density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite .",
    "we used the vienna ab initio simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite .",
    "the time step of the md simulations was set to 0.2  fs , which is short enough to describe the molecular vibrations accurately .",
    "each simulation was performed for a minimum of 0.5  ps and up to 7  ps for the lowest temperatures . to keep the temperature constant , we employed a nos thermostat @xcite . for the electrons , we used a fermi - dirac distribution within a finite temperature scheme @xcite .",
    "we used projector augmented wave ( paw ) pseudopotentials @xcite with a cut - off radius of @xmath0 for hydrogen and @xmath1 for oxygen .",
    "we used a plane - wave basis energy cut - off at @xmath2  ev . to sample the brillouin zone , we used the baldereschi point @xcite , except for pure water , for which a @xmath3 monkhorst - pack k - point grid @xcite was used .",
    "we performed a few simulations with finer k - point grids and found consistent results within the statistical errorbars .",
    "for the exchange - correlation functional , we chose the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) of the perdew , burke & ernzerhof ( pbe ) type @xcite because it gave reasonable results for pure hydrogen @xcite and pure water @xcite .",
    "we also verified our predictions by performing additional simulations with the van der waals density functional ( vdw - df ) by @xcite .",
    "the resulting mixing properties were in agreement with our pbe predictions at 1000  k. a more detailed comparison of the pbe and van der waals functionals is given in the recent work by @xcite .    to explore the phase separation at a given pressure and temperature ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the gibbs free energy .",
    "standard molecular dynamics only provide the internal energy and the pressure but not the entropy of the system .",
    "therefore we performed a thermodynamic integration using an auxiliary classical pair potential @xcite because it provides the helmholtz free energy difference @xmath4 between two systems characterized by two different potentials @xmath5 and @xmath6 :    @xmath7    where the parameter @xmath8 defines a hybrid potential @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath10 means that we take the average over a trajectory computed with the potential @xmath11 .",
    "we performed the integration in two distinct steps .",
    "first we integrated between the potential as given by the dft , @xmath12 , and a set of classical pair potentials , @xmath13 , that we constructed by matching the forces on configurations taken from a dft trajectory that was computed beforehand for a particular temperature , density , and composition .    while pair potentials provide a sufficiently good description of water at high pressure for our thermodynamic integration technique to work well  @xcite , special care needs to be taken to describe molecular hydrogen .",
    "pair potentials have a deep minimum that represents the intramolecular binding . if such attractive pair potentials are used without any repulsive many - body term , unphysical chains and clusters of hydrogen nuclei form . in @xcite ,",
    "a repulsive many - body potential was constructed and a stable thermodynamic integration technique was obtained for molecular and partially dissociated hydrogen . since here we are dealing with water - hydrogen mixtures that lead to a more diverse set of short - lived chemical species , we pursued a different and simpler approach .",
    "we constructed sets of _ non - bonding _",
    "pair potentials that we have developed and tested recently  @xcite . by removing all attractive parts from the pair potentials",
    ", we prevented the formation of unphysical clusters .",
    "hydrogen molecules still form gradually as we switch from the non - bonding potentials to the dft forces . we determined that using between 5 to 7 @xmath8 points was still sufficient to accurately calculate the integral in eq .",

    "a few transient bigger molecules were identified also .",
    "the temperature has a strong impact on the degree of dissociation as expected . while at 2000  k and below , the mixture is almost fully molecular , at 6000  k we observe a system that is nearly fully dissociated .",
    "we thus expect a much higher electric conductivity at 6000  k because the dissociation is generally associated with ionization especially if hydrogen is present @xcite .    for both temperatures , the fraction of dissociated species appears to increase with pressure .",
    "water molecules tend to split into hydroxide and hydrogen ions or even to fully dissociate , entering into the regime where no stable chemical bonds exist .",
    "the computed equation of state of the homogeneous mixtures shows only small deviations from the ideal mixing approximation .",
    "we thus conclude that an ideal mixing law may provide quite reasonable estimates for the purpose of planetary modeling in general as long as no phase separation is expected and that very accurate eoss for the pure systems are used .    moreover , we do not find a phase separation for the hydrogen - water mixtures we studied . as was observed for other mixtures at higher pressure @xcite ,",
    "the entropy is nearly ideal and contributes the most to the free energy of mixing , which stabilizes the homogeneous mixture .",
    "we have to stress here that our miscibility predictions differ slightly from what has been inferred from high pressure experiments by @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diag ] for comparison ) . in these experiments , samples of different minerals",
    "were compressed up to a 2.5  gpa in presence of water . due to chemical reactions",
    ", hydrogen was released . in some conditions a phase separation of water and hydrogen occurred , even for temperatures above 1000  k.",
    "while these experiments may be relevant for the earth s interior , the conditions are quite different from the envelope of the giant planets where no minerals are present .",
    "we therefore suggest that diamond anvil cell experiments water - hydrogen mixtures in a mineral - free environment should be performed .    with knowledge of the experimental work by @xcite",
    ", @xcite constructed a van laar mixing model using the molar volume of the pure species and a van laar parameter fitted on earlier experiments at the kbar regime .",
    "this model predicts hydrogen - water mixture to phase separate at even higher temperatures that suggested by @xcite . when we constructed a van laar mixing model , we were not able to obtain a good fit to our _ ab initio _ gibbs free energies , even though the molar volumes in our simulations of the pure species agree quite well with the values that aranovich used . to match our _ ab initio _ data ,",
    "the van laar model would need to be extended by including nonideal mixing effects for the volume and the van laar mixing parameter @xmath48 would need to be made temperature and pressure dependent .    the fact that our results indicate the water - hydrogen mix at 2 - 70 gpa has implications on our understanding of ice giant planets .",
    "the generic three layer model @xcite with a hydrogen - rich outer envelope , a water - rich intermediate layer , and a rocky core may be a simplification .",
    "the boundary between the hydrogen and water layers is at about 10  gpa and 2000  k in uranus and neptune , which falls into the parameters regime that we explored with our simulations . yet",
    "our results show that such a sharp boundary between the two layers is thermodynamically unstable .",
    "convection will efficiently mix the two layers unless the system approaches a semi - convective state .",
    "therefore we can not rule out the three - layer picture completely because the time scale of the mixing has to be taken into account . in the core - accretion model",
    "@xcite , solid planetesimals are accreted first , followed by a run - away gas accretion . the core is assumed to differentiate quickly letting the lighter components rise to the surface of the core .",
    "based on our results , water would start to mix with the gas but the time scale is then a key parameter . if the mixing is only diffusive , the planet remains in a nearly differentiated state because the diffusive time scale of water in hydrogen can be as long as @xmath49 years based on the diffusion coefficient estimates in @xcite and the size of the envelope given by @xcite . on the other hand , if there is a vigorous and sustained convective activity then in a few convective time scale ( on the order of a 100 years time scale ( * ? ? ?",
    "* p 294 ) ) the planet should be homogenized , which would be incompatible with the multiple layers assumption .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite showed that depending on the conditions , semi - convection may set in .",
    "if a gradient of composition exists in the interior of a planet , gravity may prevent an efficient convection of heavy elements . in this case ,",
    "a series of alternating diffusive and convective layers are predicted to occur .",
    "although the long term evolution of such a semi - convective state is not fully understood it is a possible mechanism for maintaining fairly steep compositional gradients .",
    "the planet would then have a water - rich deep inner envelope and a gradual , semi - convective transition to a hydrogen - rich envelope .",
    "finally , we want to discuss the importance of the water - hydrogen miscibility for exoplanet interior modeling . given a mass and radius observation for a sub - neptune planet",

    "[ fig : mr_h2-h2o ] , we also compare the hydrogen fraction for fully mixed and differentiated water - hydrogen planets for a given radius .",
    "if a planet with 10 earth masses and 4 earth radii were detected , one would infer a hydrogen fraction of only 8%  ( 0.8 earth masses ) if one assumed a differentiated interior .",
    "the central pressure would be 5.6 mbar , and the pressure at the water - hydrogen boundary would be 0.12 mbar , which is far below the molecular - to - metallic transition pressure in pure hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand if one assumed a homogeneously mixed interior structure , the hydrogen mass fraction would increase by 25% ( 2.5 earth masses ) and the central pressure would decrease to 1.4 mbar , which is sufficiently high for hydrogen molecules to dissociate .",
    "this reaction would also increase the electrical conductivity of the mixture and further the generation of magnetic fields .",
    "the inferred hydrogen fraction increases significantly if a mixed interior is assumed because hydrogen gas is very compressible and then some hydrogen fluid is exposed to much higher pressure . for differentiated planets of 10 earth masses ,",
    "we find hydrogen is never exposed to more than 0.31 mbar regardless of the planet s radius .",
    "the central pressure was found to decrease with increasing hydrogen content because water is diluted with a material of smaller density .",
    "a difference of 0.8 and 2.5 earth masses in hydrogen contents also has implication for our understanding of the environment where the planet formed .",
    "using dft molecular dynamics simulations , we showed that on the range of pressure from 2 to 70  gpa and temperature from 1000 to 6000  k , the water - hydrogen mixtures behave close to an ideal mixture .",
    "we found that no phase separation is expected for this parameter range .",
    "a homogeneous mixture is always thermodynamically preferred for all concentrations .",
    "our simulation results are in disagreement with water - hydrogen mixtures experiments in mineral cells @xcite in the lowest pressure - temperature regime explored by our calculations .",
    "we would suggest that high - pressure experiments of hydrogen - water mixture should be performed in a mineral - free environment in order to better constrain the phase diagram in this regime .",
    "since we predict no phase separation for water and hydrogen , this has consequences for the ice giant planets .",
    "if a planet already has a mixed water - hydrogen layer , the thermodynamic properties , in particular the entropy of mixing , prevent any differentiation from occurring .    if a planet has two separate water and hydrogen layers , this implies two things .",
    "first , the icy materials must have been delivered early on when very little gas was present or the icy planetesimals must have been sufficiently large so that they penetrated through the existing atmosphere .",
    "both possibilities would be consistent with the core accretion model .",
    "furthermore such a planet could not be fully convective , otherwise water and hydrogen would mix assuming the pressure at the interface is in the 2 - 70 gpa range .",
    "it is possible , however , for the planet to remain predominantly differentiated because the interior may assume a semi - convective state , in which water and hydrogen would not mix efficiently . because the long - term dynamics of this semi - convection is not sufficiently well understood , it is difficult to model the evolution of planetary interiors on the gigayear time scale when compositional gradients are present .",
    "we also showed that , unlike in the case of rock - iron mixtures , the mixing of water and hydrogen can drastically increase the estimates of the hydrogen content of sub - neptune exoplanets .",
    "this effect has to be taken into account when their interior structure and evolution are modeled .",
