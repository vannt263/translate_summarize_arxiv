    "our calculations consist of three parts .",
    "the first part includes time - dependent , 2.5-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations , i.e. time - dependent 2-dimensional simulations with rotation .",
    "the equations of hydrodynamics are solved using the zeus-2d code @xcite , which we have modified to take into account various processes of radiation - matter interaction .",
    "the extensive heating occurs on a timescale which is much shorter than the dynamical time , which makes the system of equations stiff , and thus including such processes requires a modification of the zeus hydrodynamical scheme @xcite .",
    "radiation - matter interactions include : compton and photoionization heating and compton , radiative recombination , bremsstrahlung and line cooling .",
    "the xstar @xcite code is used to calculate rates of heating - cooling , and also to calculate tables of line opacities .",
    "these are used in the final stage , when we calculate the emergent spectrum .",
    "we calculate the transfer of polarized radiation in spectral lines in the rapidly moving medium adopting the @xcite approximation , together with a three - dimensional version of the method of escape probabilities @xcite .",
    "the gas evaporated from the surface of the torus by x - ray heating is confined within the torus funnel within a vertical range of @xmath16 pc .",
    "the sonic surface is located at , or very close to the surface of the funnel ( see fig .",
    "3 of @xcite , where the flow dynamics is described in detail ) .",
    "the torus maintains aspect ratio of @xmath17 until very late times when it is significantly depleted by the mass loss .",
    "simulations show that the flow is very highly ionized close to the axis with a temperature approaching compton temperature , and at higher inclinations as the wind is more dense , self - screening provides favorable conditions for the formation of warm absorber spectra . at inclinations where warm absorber gas is observed , the line - of - sight first touches the stripped cool gas of the torus outskirts , and then penetrates through the torus wall .",
    "the distribution of the ionization parameter , @xmath18 varies dramatically along the line - of - sight . at inclinations , @xmath19 ,",
    "the radiation of the nucleus is heavily obscured .",
    "warm absorber spectra are produced within a range of angles @xmath20 at such inclinations .",
    "the inferred velocity of the gas decreases as the inclination increases .",
    "the results of hydrodynamic modeling are post - processed with our radiation transfer code .",
    "this code makes use of the sobolev approximation to calculate a three - dimensional transfer of the polarized radiation in approximately @xmath21 spectral lines in 0.1 -10 kev range .",
    "a precursor of this approach included 3d sobolev radiation transfer of the un - polarized radiation and is described in @xcite .",
    "scattering of the polarized radiation in a resonant spectral line with corresponding calculations of the scattering phase matrix , was studied by , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , calculations which take into account transfer of polarized light through a general 3-dimensional distribution of opacity are numerically demanding . to make them tractable for the many lines in a real gas , significant modification is required both to the methods and the algorithm .",
    "following chandrasekhar , we describe the intensity of the polarized radiation by the stokes vector : @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are the intensity components projected on two arbitrary , orthogonal axes ; @xmath25 measures the polarization @xmath26 away from the axis , and @xmath27 measures circular polarization . the equation , describing the transfer of the polarized radiation in arbitrary direction @xmath28 , reads , ( e.g. @xcite ) :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is a stokes vector source function , @xmath31 is a frequency of the photon , measured in the  lab  frame , and @xmath32 is the spectral line profile , and @xmath33 is the line opacity . every resonance with a spectral line , is accompanied by a corresponding change in the radiation field :    @xmath34    that is , the radiation field consists of the local and distant contributions ; the sobolev optical depth @xmath35 @xcite is assumed to be independent of polarization . the first term in ( [ intens_jump_onefs ] )",
    "gives the attenuation of the external radiation and the @xmath36 term is the reinforcement of the radiation due to scattering of the radiation from all directions into the direction towards an observer .",
    "the sobolev optical depth scales the escape probability , @xmath37 which is given by @xmath38 integrating ( [ radiationtransfereq1 ] ) we adopt the disconnected approximation @xcite ; that is , we assume that the interaction between resonances along the line - of - sight is happening only in the forward direction ( towards the observer ) , and that all other possible interactions are neglected . only resonant line transitions",
    "are considered , and complete frequency redistribution in the co - moving frame is assumed .",
    "the source function , @xmath39 is calculated from the following @xcite :    @xmath40    where @xmath41 is the scattering phase matrix , given by @xcite .",
    "this matrix is a generalization of the case of a linear combination of the rayleigh and isotropic phase matrices ; coefficients of the matrix depend on the angular momentum quantum numbers of the initial and final states of the transition @xcite .",
    "the mean intensity , @xmath42 depends on the availability of radiation , and thus on a source function , which itself depends on angles through its dependence upon @xmath37 .",
    "we take approximately into account the depolarizing effect of finite sobolev optical depth , and thus avoid overprediction of the polarization fraction .",
    "that is , when the local escape probability , @xmath43 , the photon suffers many uncorrelated resonance scatterings within the resonant region , which tend to depolarize and make isotropic the local contribution to the radiation field .",
    "solving such a problem in a medium with spatial velocity gradients is better done with a local monte carlo simulation . however , for our purposes , that would be numerically prohibitive . to make the problem tractable , we adopt a simplifying approach in which the source function is represented as a combination of the source function derived for an isotropic phase matrix for the local contribution to the radiation field , and an anisotropic part for the distant contribution .",
    "the mean intensity @xmath44 consists of two parts : one is the local contribution which depends on the source function , @xmath39 , and the other is given by the radiation coming from the external source ( the  core  ) .",
    "the idea is to calculate @xmath44 , form the angular independent , _ un - polarized _ source function , @xmath45 , and then to substitute it in ( [ sourcefuntion_def ] ) .",
    "such an approximation captures important properties of sobolev transfer of the polarized radiation , anticipated also on physical grounds .",
    "making use of the method of escape probabilities @xcite , @xmath39 is found with the further help of the relation : @xmath46 , where we make use of the notation : @xmath47 .",
    "the last term represents the probability for the radiation of the core , @xmath48 to reach a given point , weighted by the probability of penetration .",
    "we assume that the core emits continuum radiation of specific intensity @xmath49 which is constant near the frequency of the line .",
    "for the source function which takes into account the effects of polarization we obtain : @xmath50 where the un - polarized source function , @xmath51 is found from the relation :    @xmath52    in case of isotropic scattering , from ( [ sourcefunctionpolarized ] ) one will recover ( [ sourcefunctionunpolarized ] ) , i.e. the un - polarized source function , which is usually used in sobolev calculations of the line spectra .",
    "the other extreme is @xmath53 ; all photons arriving from the core are scattered and leave the resonance region without any further interaction , so that no gradient - related effects are important . on the other hand , if @xmath54 a given photon is scattered many times within the same local resonant region .",
    "the resultant intensity may get significantly depolarized .",
    "the resultant polarization of the local contribution to the intensity is largely determined by the last scattering event , i.e. by the @xmath55 term .",
    "further details of the method including the geometry are given in @xcite for the non - polarized case ( for the geometry of the problem compare with their figure 1 ) .",
    "here we formally generalize to the case where four components of the stokes vector are transfered .",
    "we have rigorously tested our code with respect to problems of sobolev transfer of the polarized flux in individual lines and the distribution of lines .",
    "prescribing different distributions of the velocity and density we are able to compare transfer of the individual polarized modes with results of un - polarized transfer calculations .",
    "in two orthogonal linear polarization modes , @xmath23,@xmath24 ( up ) .",
    "polarization fraction , @xmath56 ( bottom ) . ]",
    "but at inclination @xmath57 . ]",
    "a notable feature of most warm absorber spectra is the fact few of the lines appear truly black in their cores .",
    "while this could be due to finite resolution or finite column of the gas , in our simulations this is because of scattering into the line core .",
    "such scattering typically occurs at angles close to 90@xmath58 , and so the residual flux in the lines is highly polarized .",
    "this is similar to the polarization of the ( rest frame ) uv lines observed from broad absorption line quasars @xcite .",
    "figure [ figspectr_50 ] shows spectra and the corresponding polarization fraction , @xmath56 at inclination @xmath59 after the wind simulation has evolved through four dynamical times ( the dynamical time is given by : @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the bh mass in units of @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the radius of the torus in pc ) each synthetic spectrum is convolved with a gaussian with width and centroid related by @xmath64 . in the 0.1 - 10 kev range ,",
    "the most prominent feature of the spectrum is an absorption trough ( figure [ figspectr_50 ] , upper panel ) and a corresponding maximum in polarization at @xmath65 kev ) .",
    "this is due to h- , and he - like oxygen and moderately ionized iron , @xmath66 .",
    "the polarization maximum has @xmath67 , and polarization at fwhm=0.05 kev about 2% .",
    "this is produced at a distance @xmath682.1 pc from the bh , where the radial column density rises from @xmath69 to @xmath70 , and the ionization parameter , @xmath18 @xcite drops from @xmath71 to @xmath72 within a region @xmath73 pc .",
    "this results in an ideal situation for scattering in the flow , since further away the plasma is again over - ionized : @xmath74 .",
    "polarization of lines in the 0.1 - 2 kev band is generally @xmath751% , but for the strongest lines the polarization can reach 2  3% in the o viii l@xmath76 and ne ix he @xmath76 lines ; and @xmath6810% in the case of the features at @xmath77 kev .    at high inclinations , @xmath78 , most lines appear in emission , and the continuum flux is @xmath79 of that at low inclinations .",
    "figure [ figspectr_70 ] shows the spectrum and corresponding polarization fraction , @xmath56 at inclination @xmath80 .",
    "one of the insights provided by multi - dimensional transfer calculations is the importance of blending of multiple lines , i.e. when several lines collectively appear as a single strong feature .",
    "blending of multiple lines from fe xxv and fe xxvi forms such a spectral feature at @xmath81 kev , at the inclination in figure [ figspectr_70 ] , resembling a p - cygni line . however , this shape is not due to the effect of the moving wind , rather it is an interplay between geometric effects and ionization balance .",
    "that is , due to the attenuation of the continuum at high inclinations , when the continuum intensity in the line emitting region falls below a threshold , @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is the source function and @xmath35 is the optical depth , then the ensemble of lines corresponding to lower ionized gas pops up above the continuum , while the more highly ionized gas is still seen in absorption .",
    "other examples of such features occur at lower inclinations , such as at @xmath84 , corresponding to the @xmath85 edge at 16.8@xmath86 ( 739 ev ) , together with lines from the l shell of fe .",
    "figure [ fig_pol ] shows the distribution of polarization fraction versus inclination angle .",
    "we plot the maximum polarization , @xmath87 ( @xmath56 convolved with a gaussian with @xmath88 ) , and the flux mean @xmath89 in the 0.1 - 2 and 2 - 10 kev bands .",
    "this shows that the maximum polarization is @xmath90 over a wide range of angles .",
    "the various peaks and troughs in this plot are reflections of the density structure in the flow , including wedges of gas which are stripped off the torus .",
    "the flux mean polarization has a maximum near @xmath91 , where @xmath92 and @xmath93 . at @xmath94 the flux mean polarization in the 0.1 - 10 kev range is @xmath95 and",
    "the maximum is @xmath96 . at such inclinations",
    "the torus is compton thick along the line of sight and the continuum flux is very low , @xmath97 of the unattenuated value .",
    "scattering by free electrons from optically thin plasma can produce a continuum polarization fraction which is comparable to that in the lines @xcite .",
    "optically thin , single scattering approximation provides an upper limit for the polarization .",
    "this approach takes into account the geometry of the problem together with optical depth effects and predicts both the polarized flux and the fractional polarization is less than those produced by lines .",
    "this is shown as the labeled curve in figure [ fig_pol ] ) . at those viewing angles where the thomson continuum has significant polarization ,",
    "the flux is @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the flux of the core .",
    "our results show that models in which the obscuring torus is the source of an x - ray excited flow generate potentially observable polarization signatures due to significant scattering of x - rays by atomic features in the flow .",
    "thomson electron scattering continuum at @xmath100 has polarization @xmath101 ; it is increasing to a maximum of @xmath102 at @xmath103 , and then decreases at larger @xmath104 .",
    "polarization from lines is greater and has the following properties : at very low inclination , @xmath105 , corresponding to prototypical seyfert 1 galaxies , the linear polarization fraction is negligible averaged over the spectrum , but most absorption lines have some residual , highly polarized flux ; the maximum polarization fraction in strong lines is @xmath106 . at higher inclinations , @xmath107 in the 0.1 - 2 kev range the mean",
    "polarization is 10% , and the maximum polarization is 20 - 30% ; in the 6 - 8 kev range the mean polarization is 2 - 10% , and the maximum polarization 20 - 30% . at still higher inclinations",
    "@xmath108 our models are very compton thick .",
    "scattering in x - ray lines above the torus funnel produces very strongly polarized flux with mean polarization fraction more than 20% and maximum polarization 60 - 70% .",
    "although these predictions are specific to our dynamical calculations , the general behavior will hold for any scenario involving an outflow which is shadowed by a torus with aspect ratio near unity .",
    "observations which fail to show such high polarization would call into question current ideas about the torus location , shape and thickness .",
