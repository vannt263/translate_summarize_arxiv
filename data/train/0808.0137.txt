    "within the context of ao systems pyramid wavefront sensors ( pwfs ) are a relatively novel concept .",
    "the special interest in this concept arises from the prediction of a gain in sensitivity  and thus in limiting magnitude  for a nonmodulated pwfs over a shack - hartmann sensor ( shs ) @xcite in closed - loop conditions for a well - corrected point source .",
    "the definition of this gain is that in order to achieve the same correction quality the pwfs needs less signal than the shs .",
    "this gain in sensitivity results basically from the fact that the accuracy of the measurement and the resulting reconstruction error @xmath0 of the shs depends on @xmath1 with @xmath2 = sensing wavelength , @xmath3 = subaperture size typically chosen on the order of the fried - parameter @xmath4 for typical site seeing at science wave - length . in the case of the pwfs",
    "the measurement error @xmath5 depends on @xmath6 with @xmath7 being the telescope diameter ( @xmath8 ) . from these formulas",
    "the difference in stellar magnitudes that are needed to achieve the same strehl ratio for the exemplary case of tip - tilt only can be derived for both sensors as @xmath9 .",
    "simulations show , for instance , @xcite that the gain in sensitivity for a 4 m class telescope and a seeing of @xmath10 ( @xmath11 cm ) is predicted to be 2 magnitudes .",
    "wavefront sensing based on the pyramid principle has its origin in the foucault knife - edge test .",
    "the historical development of the pwfs is described in @xcite .",
    "the optical setup of a pyramid sensor is shown in figure [ im : f1 ] .",
    "the transmissive , four - sided pyramid prism is placed in the focal plane .",
    "the focus is placed on the tip of the pyramid .",
    "after the pyramid , a relay lens images the pupils onto the detector.the signal a four - sided ao pwfs system uses are the intensities inside four pupil images . the illumination of these images depends on the aberrations of the wavefront .",
    "the signal @xmath12 one extracts is the difference in intensities @xmath13 between corresponding pixels in the four pupils , i.e. , the pixels at the same optical position in the pupils as shown in fig.[im : f1 ] :    @xmath14}\\over{i_1(x , y)+i_2(x , y)+i_3(x , y)+i_4(x , y)}}\\ ] ]    @xmath15}\\over{i_1(x , y)+i_2(x , y)+i_3(x , y)+i_4(x , y)}}\\ ] ]    for the x- and y - direction , respectively .",
    "these signals @xmath12 are what we will refer to as gradients , even if they might not exactly represent wavefront gradients . in the limit of small perturbations and a telescope with infinite aperture the frequency spectrum of the signal @xmath16 of our sensor",
    "is given by @xmath17 here @xmath18 means fourier transform , @xmath19 the phase of the electromagnetic wave with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the coordinates in fourier space , and sgn the sign - function ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus the sensor is working as a phase sensor in this regime .",
    "the principle of the pwfs implies some limitations that either do not occur in other sensor types , or have a much more `` dramatic '' impact on pwfss than on other sensor types . in this class",
    "fall the structure of the pyramid edges that cause both diffraction and scattering , the read out noise of the system , the goodness of centering the beam on the pyramid tip , noncommon - path aberrations , and the homogeneity of the pupil illumination , the latter being important especially during calibration .",
    "it is these limitations , that may ultimately influence the choice of this or another sensor type , that will be examined in the course of this article .",
    "the structure in the remaining part of the article is as follows : in the next section , the pyramir system is described in detail .",
    "the optical path and the possible detector read out modes are explained .",
    "section 3 accounts for the calibration procedure of the system .",
    "the peculiarities of tip - tilt calibration and flattening the wavefront are presented .",
    "section 4 shows fundamental limitations to the performance of a pyramid system .",
    "`` fundamental '' in this case is not meant to be based on natural laws and constants , but on always - present aberrations and nonideal conditions .",
    "thus , the fundamental limitations discussed here can be eased by careful alignment and set up of the system , but they can never entirely be removed . in this context , we explore the effect of static aberrations , different calibration light sources , and diffraction and scattering on the pyramid edges to the response of the system . in the next section",
    "the implications of the modal cross talk of the system aliasing and measurement error to the number of modes to be calibrated , and the residual wavefront error are calculated .",
    "we end the section with a prediction of the on - sky performance under different seeing conditions .",
    "the last section concludes the results of our measurements and the implications for any pyramid wavefront sensor.on-sky results will be presented in a following paper @xcite .",
    "pyramir is a pwfs working in the effective wavelength regime between 1.26 and 2.4 @xmath22 m ( j , h , k - bands ) .",
    "it is integrated into the alfa - system at the 3.5 m telescope of the calar alto observatory .",
    ".properties of the pyramir system [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     in the case of pyramir we have the choice of three different fibers with the characteristics shown in table [ fiber ] .",
    "the fwhm mentioned there is the width of the illumination in the pupil plane , not the focal plane .",
    "the mm fiber can be resolved by pyramir : the entrance beam from the fiber has a f/10 optics , the pyramir output a f/100 . in k",
    "band the fiber must therefore be smaller than 22@xmath22 m in order not to be resolved .",
    "thus our mm fiber is resolved.in the following we will address two important questions :    1 .",
    "what is the effect of a resolved fiber or a gaussian illumination on the on - sky performance of the system ? 2 .   how does an extended light source during the measurement effect the performance of the system ?",
    "fig.[im : f10 ] , left panel , addresses question 1 .",
    "there , the response of the system for different illuminations during calibration is shown .",
    "the fiber with high na was used as the light source during measurement because between the three fibers it best resembles a point source . the sensitivity after a calibration with fiber 1 or 2",
    "is reduced with respect to the calibration with fiber 3 the true point source .",
    "this shows that an extended calibration fiber as well as a gaussian illumination , during calibration reduces the sensitivity of the system .",
    "the effect of an extended object as the target during measurement is shown in fig.[im : f10 ] , right panel .",
    "the response of the system is slightly better for a calibration with the mm fiber but the difference is much smaller than the one shown in fig.[im : f10 ] .",
    "therefore a calibration with a perfect point source and a flat illumination of the pupil during calibration will be the best choice even for the use of an extended object as the target for the cl operation .",
    "infrared detectors have large ron in comparison to ccds . therefore in the regime of faint stars",
    "the ron is quite important .",
    "the effect of the ron can be seen from the calculations of the photons needed for a given signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) per subaperture in the dependence of the ron per pixel : @xmath23 this influence will have severe consequences for the correction because the reconstruction error is inversely proportional to @xmath24 .",
    "ron we lose 5 mag.,width=453 ]    from the above equation one can easily derive the magnitudes we lost to ron as : @xmath25 therefore the higher the s / n of the photon flux alone , the less important the ron . on the sky we have shown pyramir to operate well down to s / n ratios of 0.4 per subaperture @xcite . taking this value as the limit , the loss in limiting magnitude for a fixed strehl ratio is shown in fig.[im : f12 ] .",
    "so for 1 @xmath26 noise per pixel only we already lose about 1.5 mag . at our level of 20 @xmath26",
    "the loss is 5 mag.infrared detectors also have the disadvantage of a slow read out compared to ccds .",
    "therefore they strongly limit the bandwidth of the correction loop .",
    "one possibility to increase the read out speed is to reduce the pixel - read times . in our case",
    "this increases the combined noise of detector and read out electronics .         in fig.[im :",
    "f13 ] , left panel , we show the ron measured with the pyramir detector in dependence of the pixel - read times .",
    "the limit for slow read out is 20@xmath26 . with decreasing pixel - read time , it strongly rises .",
    "if we increase the loop bandwidth by decreasing the pixel - read times the limiting magnitude is reduced by the combination of faster loop speed and increase in noise .",
    "fig.[im : f13 ] , right panel , shows this combined effect .",
    "noncommon - path aberrations are unavoidably present in every ao system . due to the small linear regime of a pwfs",
    "it is of high importance to find a good way to deal with them . in the following we look into two of the three most important properties of a wavefront sensor : the regime of linear response and",
    "the modal cross talk in dependence of the static aberrations .",
    "in the linear regime the sensor will work with the best performance .",
    "the orthogonality of the modes etc .",
    "are best in the linear regime .",
    "it should lie symmetrically around the zero point .",
    "the modal cross talk , i.e. the nonorthogonality of the modes should be as small as possible .",
    "thus the mode set chosen should be well adapted to the geometry of the total system , including the telescope and the sky . before describing the series of measurements performed , we have to explain how a measurement is actually laid , out.before we can start to measure we have to calibrate the system i.e. , apply modes to the dm and measure the gradient pattern on the sensor .",
    "these measurements give us the interaction matrix , i.e. , gradients for modes .",
    "then the ( pseudo)inverse of the interaction matrix is calculated resulting in the reconstruction matrix .",
    "a `` measurement '' is now done simply by multiplying the measured interaction matrix with a reconstruction matrix , where the latter is possibly taken under different circumstances , e.g. , with different static aberrations applied .",
    "further on the measurements showed that there is only a marginal difference regarding the important properties of the sensor , i.e. , linear regime , etc .",
    ", between the use of the gradients that are measured directly and the mode coefficients that are calculated using the reconstruction matrix of the system . therefore , in the following , we will exclusively use the mode coefficients for characterization .      in order to get a preselection of the most appropriate set of modes for the sensor",
    ", we performed an extensive series of measurements @xcite .",
    "three different sets of modes were under examination in simulation : normalized karhunen - loeve ( kl ) modes , eigen modes of the dm , and eigen modes of the pyramir system .",
    "the correction of atmospheric aberrations with these modes was examined in a simulation .",
    "this simulation showed that the pyramir eigen modes are a bad choice for closed - loop operation .",
    "the reason is that one needs a high number of these modes to reconstruct even low - order atmospheric modes .",
    "the other two mode sets were similar in their performance .",
    "due to the fact that the eigen modes of the dm yield lower condition numbers , we planned to use those for cl correction .",
    "nevertheless the effect of static aberrations and the linear regime of the sensor was measured for both mode sets , the dm eigen modes and kl modes .",
    "the amplitude of calibration varied between -2 and + 2 @xmath27 ( in exceptional cases from -4 to + 4 @xmath27 ) in steps of 0.1 @xmath27 in k band .",
    "several static aberrations were applied with amplitudes ranging from 0 to 2 @xmath27 rms in steps of 0.2 @xmath27 . from this characterization",
    "we will find the best mode set to characterize the sensor s dependence on static aberrations.here we compare the response of the system for the two different mode sets .",
    "both sets are normalized to a rms of 1 @xmath27 in k - band of the wavefront .",
    "the criteria for comparison are linear regime and modal cross talk .",
    "the linear regime is the regime in that we can perform a linear fit to the data with a @xmath28 of 0.1 or better .",
    "the modal cross talk is the residual rms of the wavefront after subtraction of the ideal response .",
    "fig.[im : f15 ] , left panel , shows the linear regime averaged over 40 modes for both sets .     of 0.1 .",
    "the linear regime of the kl modes is 15% larger than that of the eigen modes .",
    "right : modal cross talk averaged over all modes and amplitudes for each applied mode from -2 to + 2 @xmath27 .",
    "the dotted line belongs to the kl modes , while the solid line belongs to the eigen modes of the dm.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   of 0.1 .",
    "the linear regime of the kl modes is 15% larger than that of the eigen modes .",
    "right : modal cross talk averaged over all modes and amplitudes for each applied mode from -2 to + 2 @xmath27 .",
    "the dotted line belongs to the kl modes , while the solid line belongs to the eigen modes of the dm.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    surprisingly , the kl functions have a larger linear range than the eigen modes . additionally averaged over the whole range of calibration amplitudes from -2 to + 2 @xmath27 both mode sets have the same modal cross talk ( see fig.[im : f15 ] , right panel).however , there are some modes in the set of kl functions that naturally yield a high modal cross talk with others",
    ".    the future task will be to optimize the mode set further in order to minimize the total modal cross talk of the entire set of basis functions and still have an acceptable performance on sky.in the following , for laboratory purposes , we used the eigen modes unless stated otherwise .",
    "the reason is that the smaller linear regime helps to see the effects of static aberrations better .      in this subsection",
    "we will discuss the measurements of the system s behavior under static aberrations . in order to keep things simple and still see the general properties , static aberrations will be represented by one single mode with variable strength.there are differences in the effect of the statics depending on if they are applied during calibration only , during measurement only , or both.1 .",
    "static aberration during calibration only : this case is rather of academic interest.in this case one would expect little effect on the modes without statics during the measurement as long as the static mode is within the linear regime . if it is beyond the linear range there will be enhanced modal cross talk . the exception will be the mode with a static part .",
    "if the total amplitude of this mode exceeds the linear range , then the response curve during measurement should become less steep because during calibration the applied modes will be underestimated.2 .",
    "static aberration during measurement only : this will happen if one wants to have the best possible calibration and then a perfect science image moving the noncommon - path aberrations entirely into the sensor path during observation.here one would expect little effect on the modes without static pattern unless the mode is beyond the linear range .",
    "for the modes with static pattern the center of the response curve will be shifted .",
    "the amount of the shift should be just the amplitude of the static mode .",
    "additionally one would expect the modal cross talk to increase.3 .",
    "same static aberrations during calibration and measurement : this will be the case if we flatten the wavefront on the science detector and start calibration afterward.here we will expect little effect on the modes without static pattern as long as it stays inside the linear range .",
    "the modes with static parts will differ only slightly in the direction of the calibration amplitude .",
    "when the signal has amplitude either 0 or equal to the calibration amplitude , the response for the mode will be equal to the optimum response . in between the difference will not be high . in the other direction they will diverge from the optimum response curve .",
    "this divergence will depend on the strength of the static mode and the calibration amplitude .",
    "if those have , for instance , opposite signs then we will calibrate in the linear range and end up with the case of statics during measurement only .",
    "when they have the same sign , we will have a similar behavior as statics during calibration only and , thus , an underestimation of the amplitude in this direction .    .",
    "shown are the ideal case without aberration ( _ solid curve _ ) , statics during calibration only ( _ dotted curve _ ) , statics during measurement only ( _ dashed curve _ ) and statics during the whole process ( _ dash - dotted curve _ ) .",
    "the divergence from the ideal case goes with the strength of the static aberration . only the dashed and dotted curves in the case of 2 @xmath27 static aberration differ significantly from the ideal case .",
    "right : response of the mode with static aberration .",
    "the curve styles are the same as the left panel .",
    "the difference between the cases is clearly seen . here",
    "again the strength of divergence from the ideal case goes with the strength of the statics .",
    "the case closest to the ideal one is that with static aberrations during the entire procedure.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] . shown",
    "are the ideal case without aberration ( _ solid curve _ ) , statics during calibration only ( _ dotted curve _ ) , statics during measurement only ( _ dashed curve _ ) and statics during the whole process ( _ dash - dotted curve _ ) .",
    "the divergence from the ideal case goes with the strength of the static aberration . only the dashed and dotted curves in the case of 2 @xmath27 static aberration differ significantly from the ideal case .",
    "right : response of the mode with static aberration .",
    "the curve styles are the same as the left panel .",
    "the difference between the cases is clearly seen . here again the strength of divergence from the ideal case goes with the strength of the statics .",
    "the case closest to the ideal one is that with static aberrations during the entire procedure.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    after this short discussion of the expectations we will compare the theoretical considerations with the actual measurements .",
    "fig.[im : f17 ] , left panel , shows the averaged linear regime for the three cases in comparison with the ideal case .",
    "the calibration amplitude was 1 @xmath27 , and the static aberrations are applied with amplitude 0,1,or 2 @xmath27 . only in the case of the strongest static aberration during measurement",
    "only the response differs significantly from the other curves .",
    "this finding matches the expectations quite well .",
    "the divergence arises from the mode with static part , as we will see in the following .     vs amplitude of static aberration .",
    "the higher the amplitude , the stronger the modal cross talk in the case of the same static aberration during calibration and measurement the modal cross talk is rising only very slightly .",
    "the line styles are as in fig.[im : f17].,width=453 ]    the response of the special mode with static part is shown in fig.[im : f17 ] , right panel .",
    "all curves differ from the ideal case exactly as expected .",
    "however , the response of the system with statics applied during both calibration and measurement is closest to the ideal case .",
    "this property should also have an effect on the modal cross talk between the modes , as we will show immediately .    in fig.[im",
    ": f19 ] the averaged modal cross talk coefficient of the system in dependence of the amplitude of the static aberration is shown .",
    "it rises as expected for the cases with static aberration during measurement or calibration only . in the case of statics during both , the modal cross talk is nearly independent of the static mode .",
    "therefore we can conclude that in the case of noncommon - path aberrations and the wish of a perfect science image , it is best to move the aberrations all into the sensor path before calibrating the system.the real noncommon - path aberrations for the system were measured to be maximum 0.4 @xmath27 rms for a single mode or added quadratically for all modes something like 0.6 @xmath27 in k. thus one is still in the linear regime ( see fig.[im : f15 ] ) of pyramir and comparing these numbers with our result from above ( see fig.[im : f17 ] , left panel , [ im : f19 ] ) we see that we can happily use this shape of the dm ( dmbias ) as starting point for calibration and measurement . an even better way to treat the noncommon - path aberrations would be to use to different calibrations : one calibration with positive amplitude and one with negative . then in cl the modes with positive and negative amplitudes",
    "will be corrected by the corresponding reconstruction .",
    "this should reduce the measurement errors on the modes with a static part significantly .",
    "however , up to now this did not run stably on the sky .",
    "therefore in the following we will always use the same statics during calibration and measurement .      here",
    "we investigate into the dependence of relative modal cross talk , aliasing and the measurement error on the amplitude of calibration . for small calibration amplitudes",
    "the strength of the mode signal is comparable to the noise on the detector , and we , therefore , expect the errors to decrease with rising calibration amplitude at least within the linear regime . outside the border of the linear range",
    "the errors will increase again because of a rising nonorthogonality of the modes .",
    "fig.[im : f20 ] , left panel , shows the dependence of the modal cross talk and aliasing coefficients on the amplitude of calibration .",
    "the expectations are quite well matched .",
    "the modal cross talk is high for small calibration amplitudes and drops toward the border of the linear regime at about 1.2 @xmath27 .",
    "then it rises again .",
    "the aliasing error rises almost parabolic with calibration amplitude but stays within 10% difference in the linear regime .",
    "the measurement error is almost constant within the regime of -0.6 to 0.6 @xmath27 and then rising more steeply as shown in fig.[im : f20 ] , right panel .",
    "therefore we conclude that a calibration amplitude of about 0.6 @xmath27 will minimize the total reconstruction error .",
    "we have already seen in section [ subsec : center ] that the measurement error depends linearly on the strength of the static aberration .",
    "this dependence , however , is small . in section [ subsubsec : linreg ] and",
    "fig.[im : f20 ] , right panel , we showed that there is no dependence of the averaged modal cross talk on the statics .",
    "the same is true for the aliasing : fig.[im : f22 ] shows the dependence of the aliasing coefficient on static aberrations up to a strength of 2 @xmath27 .",
    "the response is averaged over all numbers of calibrated modes .",
    "this dependence will be different when the static mode is only present during closed loop .",
    "after we measured the modal cross talk of the system for different cases , one general question arises : how much modal cross talk can we tolerate ?",
    "this question is tightly connected to the problem of how many modes are appropriate to calibration .",
    "we will see that from the dependence of the total residual wavefront error is dependent on the number of calibrated modes .",
    "there are several errors that depend on this number :    1 .   the modal cross talk between the calibrated modes @xmath29 2 .   aliasing @xmath30 3 .   the measurement error @xmath31 4 .   the temporal error @xmath32 5 .   the fitting error @xmath33 .",
    "before solving the total problem we have to investigate into the nature of the single errors . to derive these we have to take the strength of the atmospheric modes taken from @xcite , @xmath34 @xmath35 into account .",
    "the equation describes the residual wavefront error after a perfect correction of the first @xmath36 modes .",
    "thus the difference between the results for @xmath36 + 1 and @xmath36 modes describes the error connected with mode @xmath36 alone .",
    "also we have to include the correction of the modes in cl operation .",
    "this is the point where the temporal error comes in during this investigation , because the band - width of the modes increases with mode number.modal cross talk and aliasing : both have quite similar effects but not identical .",
    "aliasing describes high - order modes we have not calibrated , but that show up as lower - order modes thus giving erroneous signals .",
    "modal cross talk , however , arises between modes we know .",
    "therefore we get erroneous signals between all the modes we calibrated .",
    "but due to the fact that we also measure the real mode signal we are able to reduce their amplitudes in cl and , therefore , the strength of the error with respect to the aliasing case .",
    "the aliasing error strongly depends on the geometry of the system . for a pwfs",
    "it is proposed to be much smaller than for the shs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "here we have measured the aliasing for calibrations of 2 to 39 ho modes . due to the fact that we originally measured 40 modes we can only use the residual 38 to 1 not calibrated modes respectively to derive the aliasing error .",
    "fig.[im : f23 ] shows the average aliasing error coefficient @xmath37 dependence on the number of modes calibrated in the system",
    ". the coefficient decreases with the number of calibrated modes for up to 10 modes then it stays constant .",
    "still for our purposes it is sufficient to assume it to be constant for all calibrations without making too large a mistake . to derive the total aliasing error on sky we still have to account for the modes not measured in the lab ( no .",
    "41 and so on ) .",
    "to include these we just assumed the aliasing coefficient to be constant for all modes .",
    "we then only had to weight every mode with its strength on sky .",
    "the total error due to aliasing for @xmath38 calibrated modes is then given as , @xmath39 here @xmath40 denotes the mode vector orthogonal to the set of calibrated modes and @xmath41 the reconstruction matrix . the error rising slowly with the number of calibrated modes .",
    "we used the formula ( eq . [ fiterr ] ) for the fitting error to account for the total strength of each mode .",
    "the modal cross talk of the modes does not only depend on the systems geometry but also on the mode set chosen for calibration .",
    "of course the set should be close to the kl modes .",
    "the reason is that the strength of these modes falls off quickly as @xmath42 with mode number and one does not want to lose the advantage of a good correction with a relatively low number of modes . for the higher order modes this is not so crucial because the fall off becomes almost flat .",
    "but still we have a bit of freedom here to reduce the total amount of modal cross talk for a given system by the optimization of the mode set .     profile .",
    "right : dependence of the measurement error on the number of calibrated modes for two values of s / n in the subapertures .",
    "the solid line denotes a s / n of 1 and the dotted line a s / n of 2.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   profile .",
    "right : dependence of the measurement error on the number of calibrated modes for two values of s / n in the subapertures .",
    "the solid line denotes a s / n of 1 and the dotted line a s / n of 2.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    fig.[im : f24 ] , left panel , shows that the averaged modal cross talk coefficient falls off with the number of calibrated modes .",
    "the best fit with a simple model yields a dependence for @xmath38 calibrated modes of @xmath43 as can be seen in fig.[im : f24 ] , right panel .",
    "thus the total measured error due to modal cross talk in open loop can be derived to be , @xmath44 here @xmath45 denotes the error for one calibrated mode only .",
    "therefore the modal cross talk will become independent of the number of modes for a higher number of calibrated modes .",
    "the benefit here is also that the strength of the modal cross talk will be strongly reduced when we close the loop because only the residuals of the corrected modes will give rise to modal cross talk . to find the best number of modes to calibrate , we have to include the measurement error as well",
    "this error depends on the s / n in the subapertures like @xmath46.\\ ] ] the dependence of the trace of @xmath47 on the number of calibrated modes is shown in fig.[im : f24 ] , right panel .",
    "this trace is the sum over the squares of the entries of the reconstruction matrix .",
    "therefore a perfect linear dependence will arise from a diagonal matrix @xmath47 .",
    "modal cross talk is the reason for any departure from this behavior .",
    "the departure is , however , very small .",
    "thus we can write the dependence as @xmath46\\propto n\\ ] ]        fig.[im : f26 ] compares these errors .",
    "the aliasing and modal cross talk are of the same order and quite small .",
    "the measurement error is shown for s / n=1 and 2 . the errors due to modal cross talk and aliasing are small compared to the others .",
    "the error , however , will decrease quadratically with rising s / n . for s / n=1 the measurement error matches the fitting error at 8 calibrated modes .",
    "the point of best correction ( minimum of solid curve ) is at 5 modes . for a s /",
    "n of 2 the largest contribution arises from the fitting error for up to 16 modes .",
    "the best correction is given for 13 calibrated modes .",
    "these curves are very helpful because we are able to change the number of modes we use for reconstruction on the fly , adapting to the actual situation .",
    "the errors presented in the last subsections were of static nature . to derive the full error budged we need to include the temporal errors due to finite loop bandwidth @xmath48 and time delay @xmath49 .",
    "these errors are given as @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 in the following the sum of the two temporal errors will be referred to as @xmath32         to derive the averaged wind speed from our measurements on ground level we used the 2/5 ratio between the wind speed at a height of 200 m and the wind speed on ground level found on paranal .",
    "this ratio numbers approximately 2 .",
    "we adapted this factor into our model .",
    "for the closed - loop application we also have to take into account that the cross talk amplitude is reduced with respect to the open loop case due to the correction by the system .",
    "therefore the weighting of the cross talk is given by the residuals from aliasing , temporal error and measurement error only , @xmath52 the cross talk itself should occur on the right hand side also but has been omitted because in cl it is much smaller than the other errors .",
    "now we can derive the expected strehl values on sky as , @xmath53\\ ] ] fig.[im : f27 ] , left panel , shows the performance for a seeing of 0.5  in k - band and a wind speed on ground level of of 3 @xmath54 for a loop update rate of 100 hz and 12 , 22 and 32 modes corrected .",
    "a strehl ratio up to about 60% is expected for bright stars .",
    "the limiting s / n is about 0.25 per subaperture .",
    "this corresponds to a stellar magnitude of 7.2 mag in k with 20% light on pyramir .",
    "fig.[im : f27 ] , right panel , shows the same for a seeing of 1  in k - band a wind speed of 5 m / s and a loop update rate of 300 hz .",
    "here we can still achieve about 39% strehl ratio . the difference in performance between",
    "the number of modes in use is much more significant .",
    "the limiting signal to noise ratio is about 0.25 per subaperture .",
    "this corresponds to a magnitude of 6.0 mag in @xmath55 with 20% light on pyramir .",
    "the reason the stars have to be so bright is the high sampling with 224 subapertures and the noise of 20@xmath56 rms per pixel .",
    "in this article we presented laboratory measurements performed with the pyramid wavefront sensor pyramir . after a short introduction into the history of pwfs and their working principles",
    ", we presented the pyramir system as infrared pwfs and explained the details of the system especially the possible read out modes of the detector .",
    "this can reach a speed of about 300 hz with a ron of 20 @xmath26 rms .",
    "the calibration procedure of the system was described in detail .",
    "the pitfalls of tt - calibration were discussed in detail leading to the conclusion that a static part in tt will reduce the limiting magnitude and enhance tt - jitter and can not be tolerated .",
    "therefore we included a static tt - part in the bias pattern of the deformable mirror ( dmbias ) to perfectly center the beam .",
    "also it has to be guaranteed that the amplitudes of calibration are the same in both axis in order to gain similar performance in both directions.some of the fundamental sources of reduced performance were examined .",
    "we found that the amount of light diffracted out of the pupil images is 50% for a flat wavefront decreasing nonlinearly up to 2 @xmath27 wavefront error where it becomes almost stable at 20% .",
    "a comparison with simulations shows that in our case this loss results from diffraction at the pyramid edges and imperfections in the optics .",
    "the latter outweighing for aberrations stronger than about 1.5 @xmath27.the effects of a gaussian illumination of the pupils , as well as the effect of an extended calibration light source , were investigated .",
    "both have strong influence on the sensitivity of the system and should be avoided . on the other hand an extended target during the measurement",
    "does only slightly effect the performance .",
    "thus the calibration light source should be as point like as possible for all applications.the effect of ron on the limiting magnitude of the guide star has been widely discussed . in the case of infrared detectors",
    "this noise is quite high . in our case",
    "20 @xmath26 rms per pixel .",
    "this reduces the limiting magnitude by 5 mag .",
    "we investigated into the best possible mode set between the eigen modes of pyramir , of the dm and the kl modes .",
    "the last two mode sets seem promising for the use on - sky .",
    "the latter has a larger linear regime than the eigen modes of the dm .",
    "the difference is small and , therefore , the correction error will not vary by much . still the larger linear regime might help to close the loop under bad seeing conditions .",
    "we tested the best treatment of noncommon - path aberrations by applying artificial modes to the dm .",
    "the best treatment turned out to direct these aberrations completely into the path of the sensor . a possible better way using two calibrations , one for modes with positive amplitude one for those with negative amplitude",
    "was proposed to reduce the error of the mode with static aberrations , but put aside due to the fact that it was not running stably during the testing on-sky.the importance of a small calibration amplitude to minimize the resulting reconstruction error was shown .",
    "after the measurement of these fundamental properties , the subject of the best number of modes to calibrate was addressed . to solve this we investigated into the behavior of modal cross talk , aliasing , and measurement error dependence on the number of modes calibrated .",
    "we found that the averaged aliasing coefficient varies only slightly with the number of modes whereas the average modal cross talk coefficient decreases inversely linear with this number and the measurement error rises linearly with this number .",
    "including the ( theoretical ) contribution of the kl modes in the wavefront error on sky we could show that the contribution of aliasing rises like @xmath57 ; the contribution of cross talk becomes constant for larger @xmath38 and the measurement error rises linearly with @xmath38 . in cl only the error due to modal cross talk changes with respect to the open loop measurement .",
    "it will decrease because the modes that are corrected will contribute less to the modal cross talk than in open loop .",
    "the error of the residual wavefront decreases like @xmath58 .",
    "altogether we could show that at the border of the limiting magnitude the fitting error surpasses all other errors for a low number of corrected modes but will be overpowered by the measurement error at about the place of the optimum number of modes to be corrected .",
    "for the pyramir system this is 5 modes .",
    "the other errors will become important for even slightly brighter stars . here cross talk and aliasing error are almost identical in strength .",
    "in the case of noncommon - path aberrations in the system the modal cross talk and aliasing errors will rise .",
    "modal cross talk increases linearly , aliasing error stays constant until the static aberration reaches the border of the linear regime of the sensor , then it increases nonlinearly . from the entire",
    "error - budged we could predict the performance on - sky for various seeing conditions . for a seeing of 1  and a wind speed on ground level of 5@xmath54 we can achieve a 39% strehl ratio in @xmath55-band , but we have to run at about maximum frame rate ( 300 hz ) .",
    "the limiting s /",
    "n per subaperture on the detector is about 0.25 or 6.0 mag in @xmath55 . for good seeing conditions and a moderate loop band width , the predicted strehl ratio will be about 60% for bright stars . again",
    "the limiting s / no per subaperture on the detector is about 0.25 or 7.2 mag in @xmath55 .",
