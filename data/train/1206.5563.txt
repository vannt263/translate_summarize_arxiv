    "in the last decades , the angular momentum of light has received much attention from very diverse areas of physics . from experimental astrophysics proposals for the detection of exotic cosmic objects @xcite to the use of light beams to rotate atoms @xcite , through the exploitation of the infinite number of possible angular momentum values for increasing the capacity of optical communication networks @xcite or developing new concepts in quantum information @xcite .",
    "the list of applications is long indeed @xcite .",
    "the availability of appropriate theoretical tools for the study of light beams with angular momentum and their interactions with matter is crucial for the development of such a wide and promising range of applications .",
    "the current state - of - the - art theoretical framework is based on the separation of angular momentum @xmath0 in its orbital ( @xmath1 ) and spin ( @xmath2 ) components : @xmath3 . in the paraxial approximation",
    "the value of the total angular momentum along the optical axis can be split into a term which depends on the azimuthal spatial phase of the field and a term which depends on the polarization @xcite .",
    "several efforts have been undertaken to rigorously extend this approach to the non - paraxial regime , but have encountered fundamental difficulties @xcite .",
    "strongly non - paraxial tightly focused light fields are the bread and butter of applications where light is made to interact with nano - structures , molecules and atoms .",
    "the mechanism of spin to orbit angular momentum conversion ( sam to oam ) , also referred to as spin - orbit interaction , is the explanation of choice for numerically obtained observations in focusing @xcite and remarkable results in scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "for example , the presence of optical vortices in tightly focused fields and in scattered fields is explained by conversions between the two types of angular momenta .    rigorously speaking , though , the separation between sam and oam can not be made on firm physical grounds .",
    "consequently , a conversion between the two quantities is not a fully satisfactory explanation for physical phenomena .",
    "the separate consideration of @xmath2 and @xmath1 is known to pose fundamental problems for the electromagnetic field @xcite and its quantum excitations @xcite , @xcite . from the point of view of quantum field theory",
    "only the total angular momentum operator is a valid observable property of the photon .",
    "even more generally , the strict non - separability is not restricted to photons .",
    "for example , it also applies to the electron since only in the non - relativistic limit can the orbital and spin parts of its angular momentum be separately considered @xcite .",
    "the fundamental reason for such non - separability is the geometry of rotations of vectors and spinors .",
    "such a restriction also applies to rotations of classical electromagnetic fields @xcite .    in this article we put forward an alternative theoretical framework for the general and rigorous treatment of the angular momentum of light and its role in light - matter interactions .",
    "our approach solves the theoretical difficulties of the current framework , draws its predictive power from symmetry considerations , and can be simply applied in practice . by using it",
    ", we discover that the actual physical reason responsible for the presence of optical vortices in tightly focused beams is totally unrelated to the one responsible for the appearance of optical vortices in scattering experiments . in the current state - of - the - art framework ,",
    "both cases are explained as sam to oam conversion .",
    "our proposal is based on total angular momentum and helicity .",
    "the role of helicity ( @xmath4 ) in light matter interactions has recently been considered @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic maxwell equations have been shown to be invariant under generalized electromagnetic duality transformations , and helicity has been identified as the generator of those transformations . by exploiting this connection , helicity can be used within the powerful formalism of symmetries and conserved quantities for the study of light matter interactions when the approximations implicit in the macroscopic maxwell equations hold @xcite .",
    "the use of symmetries and conserved quantities for the study of electromagnetic problems is the paradigm used in this article for the development of its theoretical concepts and their application to practical situations .    in section [ sec : context ]",
    "we outline the paradigm , mathematical concepts and notation used throughout the paper . in section [ sec : lzsz ] we summarize the different aspects involved in the separation of sam and oam . in section [ sec : framework ] we outline our proposal .",
    "first , we discuss the concept of helicity and its associated symmetry and comment on a result from @xcite , which shows that , upon scattering , helicity transforms independently of the geometry of the scatterer .",
    "then we show that the combined use of angular momentum and helicity solves the problems associated with the separation of sam and oam in a way that is simpler than the existing theoretical solutions and comment on the practical applicability of our ideas .",
    "finally , we establish a relationship between helicity eigenstates and the transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) components of the field . using this relationship",
    "we express the conservation law for helicity as a function of the partial scattering matrices in the te - tm basis .",
    "this expression becomes useful in the practical application of the framework . in section [ sec : spintoorbit ] we use the developed ideas to revisit the concept of sam to oam conversion in focusing and scattering .",
    "we are able to clearly identify the underlying reasons for the presence of optical vortices in focused and scattered fields , which happen to be two totally different physical phenomena connected to the breaking of two independent fundamental symmetries : transverse translational symmetry in focusing and electromagnetic duality in scattering .",
    "up to now , the two are explained by sam to oam conversion . during section [ sec : spintoorbit ]",
    ", we provide the analytical tools necessary for the practical application of our framework .",
    "section [ sec : conc ] contains our conclusions and discussion .",
    "the paradigm that we follow in our work is the use of symmetries and conserved quantities for the study of electromagnetic problems . in this article",
    "we consider classical maxwell fields .",
    "symmetry operations like rotations and translations are linear transformations that apply to the fields .",
    "similarly , we model the light - matter interactions as linear transformations of the free space fields .",
    "the fields themselves will hence always be transverse .",
    "these ideas are best formalized using the mathematical setting of hilbert spaces .",
    "therefore , in this article we make extensive use of the concepts and tools associated with a vector space endowed with an inner product , i.e. a hilbert space , and the linear operators acting within that vector space .",
    "the vector space we consider is the space of transverse solutions of maxwell s equations , or transverse maxwell fields , which we call @xmath5 .",
    "a linear operator within @xmath5 takes one of its vectors , a transverse maxwell field , and transforms it into another vector of the space , still a transverse solution of maxwell s equations .",
    "we are interested in symmetry transformations of the fields : time translation , spatial translations and rotations , etc .",
    "these transformations are operators acting within @xmath5 .",
    "such continuous symmetries are generated by hermitian operators , also acting within @xmath5 , which are associated with properties of the fields .",
    "for instance , energy generates time translations , the components of linear momentum generate spatial translations and the components of angular momentum generate spatial rotations . a hermitian operator @xmath6 generates a continuous symmetry transformation @xmath7 by means of @xmath8    see ( * ? ? ? *  .21 ) for the detailed study of classical maxwell fields using angular momentum and its generated transformation , spatial rotations .",
    "the fact that @xmath5 has an inner product allows us to speak of hermitian operators .",
    "it also allows us to construct orthonormal basis into which any transverse maxwell field can be expanded .",
    "the basis vectors can be chosen to be transverse fields which are simultaneous eigenvectors of four commuting hermitian operators .",
    "the choice of the inner product is not necessarily unique , even though the one we have used , defined in section [ sec : scattering ] has a long tradition for vector fields ( * ? ? ?",
    "13.1.21 ) .",
    "the consideration of @xmath5 , the hermitian operators associated with the fundamental quantities of the field and the transformations that these operators generate , allows to study electromagnetic problems using maxwell fields together with the powerful framework of symmetries and conserved quantities .",
    "when the electromagnetic equations of a given system are invariant under the transformations generated by a given hermitian operator , the property of the field associated with that operator is a constant of the motion .",
    "conversely , if the system does not possess that symmetry , we know that the associated property can , in general , change during evolution .",
    "the effect of the symmetry of the system is even stronger , as it must also preserve the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the operator generating the symmetry , thus offering an adequate basis of vectors to solve the electromagnetic problem .",
    "as we will show , this is a simple yet insightful approach to electromagnetic problems . in this article",
    ", we want to exploit this approach for the study of the angular momentum of light .",
    "consequently , for our purposes , we may only use properties of the electromagnetic field which are associated with a hermitian operator in @xmath5 . only then",
    "can we consider their associated symmetry .",
    "this rules out the separate use of the components of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , since their associated operators transform a transverse maxwell field into a non - transverse field @xcite , ( * ? ?",
    "* b@xmath9 ) : they do not act within the required vector space . from this point of view , @xmath1 and @xmath2",
    "are qualitatively different from @xmath0 , the linear momentum @xmath10 , the energy @xmath11 or , as we will discuss , helicity @xmath4 . in the most commonly used representation ,",
    "the expressions corresponding to these operators are @xmath12 where @xmath13 , the @xmath14-th component of @xmath15 , is a matrix of indexes @xmath16 defined using the totally antisymmetric tensor @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "as discussed above , the operators in equation ( [ eq : line1 ] ) transform a transverse maxwell field into a transverse maxwell field , while those in equation ( [ eq : line2 ] ) break the transversality of the fields .",
    "in our notation we use capital letters like @xmath19 and @xmath20 to denote operators , and lower case letters like @xmath21 ( or @xmath22 ) and @xmath23 to denote their eigenvalues .",
    "when we speak of a field having a `` sharp '' or `` well defined '' value for an operator , we mean that the field is an eigenvector of that operator with eigenvalue equal to its `` sharp '' value . in the text , names like `` helicity '' or `` third component of angular momentum '' refer to the operators unless it is clear from the context that this is not the case . also , all analytical calculations from section [ sec : scattering ] on , assume a time harmonic decomposition of the fields with an @xmath24 dependence .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that the main context of this work is that of classical maxwell fields .",
    "nevertheless , the approach here taken , which is based on the study of symmetries , is general and often used in quantum mechanics and other areas of modern physics .",
    "serious theoretical difficulties are encountered when attempting to separately consider @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the electromagnetic fields ( @xcite , @xcite ) or its quanta ( @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b@xmath9 ) ) .",
    "we also know @xcite , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* b@xmath9 ) that the operators @xmath25 and @xmath15 break the transversality of the fields , taking a vector of @xmath5 out of that space .",
    "as far as we are concerned , this prevents the separate use of @xmath25 and @xmath15 for studying electromagnetic problems using symmetries and conserved quantities : @xmath25 and @xmath15 do not generate symmetry transformations for vectors in @xmath5 .    on the other hand , the total integrated value of the angular momentum of the electromagnetic field , expressed here in convenient units as an integral over all space involving the electric and magnetic fields @xmath26 and @xmath27    @xmath28    can be separated into two gauge invariant integrals . to achieve such separation one needs to consider only the transverse parts of the field , which are always gauge independent .",
    "this restriction is justifiable because the degrees of freedom associated with the longitudinal part of the electric field can always be combined with the degrees of freedom of the sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* i.b.5),(*???*,22 ) .",
    "then , in    @xmath29    where index @xmath30 refers to the three spatial components , the two terms @xmath31 and @xmath32 are apparently gauge invariant .",
    "from now on , we will drop the @xmath33 underscripts since in this article we only consider transverse maxwell fields .",
    "the identification of the two parts of equation ( [ eq : oamsam ] ) with spin and orbital angular momenta is tempting due to the appearance of the operator @xmath34 and the relationship of the cross - product in @xmath35 with the spin-1 matrices representing @xmath15 .",
    "but , since @xmath25 and @xmath15 are not operators in @xmath5 , the question arises of which are the operators corresponding to the two parts of equation ( [ eq : oamsam ] ) . in his book on quantum mechanics , messiah (",
    "* ch . xxi , problem 7 ) offers an expression which corresponds to the second quantization of the first part of equation ( [ eq : oamsam ] ) . in 1994 , van enk and nienhuis @xcite , in a more detailed study , arrived at the same result and also derived the expression for the second part of equation ( [ eq : oamsam ] ) . in that work",
    ", they showed that the two operators are not angular momenta because they do not satisfy the commutation relations which define angular momentum operators .",
    "these fock space operators have their corresponding operators in @xmath5 for classical fields ( see section [ sec : theorprac ] ) , and their third components commute @xcite .",
    "it is hence possible to split the total angular momentum @xmath36 into two operators @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "consequently @xmath39 and @xmath40 in ( [ eq : oamsam ] ) are in reality @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "unfortunately , in terms of the separation of the angular momentum operator , this approach is not fully satisfactory because the resulting operators are not angular momentum operators .",
    "this can be easily proved by checking that their vectorial components do not fulfill the commutation relations required for angular momentum operators .",
    "the consequence of this is that they can not separately generate meaningful rotations . in summary",
    ", @xmath36 can always be decomposed into two meaningful operators , @xmath43 , independently of the paraxial approximation .",
    "these two operators are never angular momenta since they never fulfill the correct commutation relationships .",
    "this last statement is also independent of the paraxial approximation .",
    "see section [ sec : theorprac ] for a more detailed discussion .",
    "following the paradigm discussed in section [ sec : context ] , we only consider properties of the field whose corresponding operators generate transformations in @xmath5 . as already mentioned several times , this disqualifies @xmath25 and @xmath15 . as substitutes , one may choose @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "we prefer to disregard the question of the separation completely and use the total angular momentum @xmath36 and the helicity instead .",
    "our choice is based on the fact shown below ( section [ sec : theorprac ] ) that @xmath36 and helicity generate very simple symmetry transformations which lead to a simpler framework .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that expressions ( [ eq : jmean ] ) and ( [ eq : jtrans ] ) can be interpreted and computed as a weighted average .",
    "when the electromagnetic field is decomposed in a basis of eigenvectors of @xmath19 , the total integrated value @xmath46 is equal to a weighted average ( * ? ? ?",
    "the weights are the squares of the amplitudes in the linear decomposition of the field , and they multiply the different eigenvalues @xmath21 of each mode in the basis .",
    "this connection is not restricted to angular momentum .",
    "all the integrals that are used to compute total integrated values of properties of the electromagnetic field can be interpreted and computed as weighted averages involving the squares of the expansion coefficients and the eigenvalues of the operator related to each particular property .",
    "this connection is the key step used for obtaining a fock space operator from the classical spatial integral involving the fields .",
    "see for instance @xcite for the cases of @xmath11 and @xmath47 respectively .",
    "this connection relates the algebraic formalism introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : context ] with the well known spatial integrals involving the fields , like ( [ eq : jmean ] ) for the case of angular momentum .",
    "helicity is defined as the operator which results from projecting the total angular momentum onto the linear momentum @xcite , i.e. @xmath48 .",
    "helicity commutes with all the generators of rotations @xmath0 and translations @xmath10 @xcite . in the case of the photon",
    ", the helicity can only take the values @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "for the electromagnetic field , @xmath4 has only two eigenvalues equal to @xmath50 .",
    "a useful interpretation of helicity is obtained by considering the expansion of the field as a superposition of plane waves .",
    "in such a representation , helicity is associated with the handedness of each plane wave . for a particle to have a well defined helicity ,",
    "all the plane waves must be purely circularly polarized and have the same handedness with respect to its momentum vector .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : helicity ] .        given that a general light beam can always be expanded as a sum of plane waves and that helicity is associated with the polarization handedness of those plane waves , helicity seems a very suitable candidate for representing the polarization degrees of freedom of a general light beam .",
    "crucially , the action of helicity on a plane wave affects only its polarization vector : it leaves the plane wave momentum vector invariant .",
    "this is also true for other types of light beams like multipolar fields or bessel beams : the action of helicity does not change the quantities related to energy , linear or angular momenta which define those beams .",
    "helicity acts on separated degrees of freedom , which , in this article , we refer to as the degrees of freedom of the polarization .    from its definition",
    ", it is readily checked that helicity is a hermitian operator . with respect to related transformations ,",
    "helicity is the generator of the generalized electromagnetic duality transformation of the fields : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a real angle . that helicity generates duality is a remarkable fact which can hardly be deduced from the mathematical definition of helicity containing the angular and linear momenta",
    ".    generalized duality ( [ eq : dualitygeneralization ] ) is well known to be a symmetry of the source free microscopic maxwell equations .",
    "the results in @xcite allow to extend the relationship between helicity and duality to the macroscopic maxwell equations in material systems .",
    "that work shows that the helicity of the light interacting with a piecewise homogeneous isotropic medium will transform independently of the shapes of the different material domains , and that helicity will be preserved by the interaction if and only if the ratio between the relative electric and magnetic constants of all the involved materials @xmath53 $ ] is constant , that is : @xmath54    when condition ( [ eq : epsmu ] ) is met , the macroscopic maxwell s equations for the system are invariant under transformation ( [ eq : dualitygeneralization ] ) .",
    "the geometry independent character of the duality symmetry ( helicity conservation ) allows to separately consider the transformations of the polarization degrees of freedom from the geometry of the scattering problem .",
    "such notable simplification is very desirable in a framework for the study of light matter interactions .",
    "we propose the use of helicity , the generator of duality transformations , for treating the polarization degrees of freedom in electromagnetic problems .",
    "we will show that , when used in conjunction with the total angular momentum , the generator of rotations , we obtain a general framework for the study of problems involving the angular momentum of light and its interaction with matter using the language of symmetries and conserved quantities .",
    "it is important to recall that , in this article , we will remain within the approximations implicit in the macroscopic maxwell s equations @xcite .    for completeness , a expression of the total integrated value of helicity in terms of electromagnetic fields can be found in @xcite . in this article , though , we are not concerned with the total integrated value of helicity . instead , we use modes with well defined helicity and consider their transformations in particular situations , which will depend on whether the system is invariant under electromagnetic duality .      the fundamental problem of the separability of @xmath55 and @xmath56 is avoided by using @xmath4 and @xmath19 instead .",
    "both @xmath19 and @xmath4 are commuting hermitian operators in @xmath5 , and generate two simple and independent symmetry transformations of the electromagnetic field : @xmath19 generates rotations around the @xmath57 axis and @xmath4 generates the generalized duality transformation ( [ eq : dualitygeneralization ] ) .",
    "as previously mentioned , the two fock space operators obtained from the second quantization of expression ( [ eq : oamsam ] ) studied in @xcite ( and also later in @xcite ) have their corresponding operators for classical fields : in @xcite they are obtained in the momentum space .",
    "for instance , it can be seen that @xmath58 , the operator substituting @xmath55 is @xmath59 .",
    "this operator commutes with @xmath60 @xcite , whose expression is obviously @xmath61 .",
    "consequently , we could use @xmath58 and @xmath60 instead of @xmath19 and @xmath4 .",
    "considering the symmetries generated by each pair of operators we prefer to choose @xmath19 and @xmath4 for reasons of simplicity .",
    "while @xmath19 and @xmath4 are related to the two simple symmetries indicated above , the symmetries related with @xmath58 and @xmath60 are more complicated .",
    "an explicit mathematical expression for the transformation generated by @xmath45 can be found in @xcite .",
    "for once , @xmath58 involves a combination of duality and translational symmetries , while the symmetry related to @xmath60 has not been properly studied as such , up to our knowledge .",
    "this suggests that using @xmath19 and @xmath4 should , in most situations , result in a simpler analysis .",
    "for instance , it is explicitly seen in section [ sec : focusing ] that the conservation law associated with @xmath59 is not independent of the geometry of the problem .    in the paraxial limit , when @xmath62 , it can be shown that @xmath63 and @xmath64 . even in this limit , neither of these operators generates physical rotations for the full electromagnetic field . for a paraxial beam",
    ", the helicity may be approximated by the real space circular polarization component perpendicular to the @xmath57 axis and , the value of @xmath65 coincides ( see equations ( [ eq : cparaxial])-([eq : dparaxial ] ) below ) with the azimuthal phase winding number of the dominant circular polarization .",
    "it is customary to use the paraxial correspondence between sam and circular polarization and oam and azimuthal phase . from the previous considerations ,",
    "we think that it would be more insightful to use @xmath4 and @xmath65 , which have the advantage of retaining its meaning outside the paraxial approximation .    from the experimental point of view",
    ", section [ sec : helvor ] shows that the preparation of general ( non - paraxial ) beams with well defined helicity can be done using simple optics in a straightforward fashion .",
    "the measurement of the helicity state of a general beam is also shown to be easily achieved using simple optics .    in this article",
    "we focus in the combined use of @xmath4 and @xmath19 . however , it is worth mentioning that the fact that @xmath4 commutes with all the generators of rotations @xmath0 and translations @xmath10 , and that it generates a transformation which is independent of geometry , should allow its combined use with other degrees of freedom different from angular momentum when the particular problem requires it .      in this section",
    "we arrive at a relationship between helicity conservation and the scattering of the transverse electric and transverse magnetic components of the field .",
    "this relationship is useful in practical problems , as will be seen in section [ sec : spintoorbit ] .",
    "let us consider the general scattering problem presented in figure ( [ fig_scatt ] ) .",
    "an incident electromagnetic field @xmath66 impinges onto a scatterer of arbitrary shape @xmath67 resulting in the scattered field @xmath68 .",
    "consider an orthonormal basis of transverse electromagnetic modes with well defined helicity @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 , where the superindex denotes the sign of @xmath4 and the subindex @xmath71 is a composed index which contains three other commuting operators .",
    "for example @xmath72 $ ] for plane waves , with @xmath11 being the energy , and @xmath73 the first two components of linear momentum .",
    "both incident and scattered fields can be expanded using the @xmath69 basis , and the scattering process is fully characterized by the following transformation of the incident field : @xmath74\\mathbf{e}_{in } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the hermitian conjugate of @xmath76 . in ( [ eq : scatt ] ) ,",
    "the transformation @xmath15 is represented by a doubly infinite weighted sum of projection operators of the type @xmath77 , whose action on the input field is @xmath78 and the inner product @xmath79 is assumed .    transformation ( [ eq : scatt ] ) is specified by the infinite set of @xmath80 partial scattering matrices relating the coefficients of @xmath66 in @xmath81 to the coefficients of @xmath68 in @xmath82 for all @xmath71 , @xmath83 :    @xmath84    let us impose helicity conservation upon scattering , forcing all the partial scattering matrices to be diagonal : @xmath85 for all @xmath71 , @xmath83 .    consider the following linear combinations of modes with well defined helicity .",
    "@xmath86 which transform into each other by the action of @xmath4 @xmath87    in appendix [ appa ] we show that , for plane waves , bessel beams and multipoles , the sum and subtraction of modes with same @xmath71 and different helicity result in what are commonly known as te and tm modes",
    ". we will adopt the te - tm naming to denote general sum and subtractions of modes differing only by their sharp helicity eigenvalue .    since @xmath69 is an orthonormal basis ,",
    "so is @xmath88 . after changing ( [ eq : scatt ] ) to the @xmath88 basis",
    ", the condition for helicity preservation upon scattering , expressed in the te - tm basis reads :    @xmath89    for all ( @xmath71 , @xmath83 ) .",
    "namely , that the scattering of te and tm components is on an equal footing for all ( @xmath71 , @xmath83 ) , as can be seen from the scattering matrix having the same values @xmath90 in the diagonal and @xmath91 in the off - diagonal . condition ( [ eq : tetmhel ] ) is clearly a restriction which will not be met in general .",
    "we conclude that , in general , a scatterer will partially convert the helicity of the incident field and that this partial helicity conversion is reflected in asymmetries of the scattering matrices with respect to the te and tm modes .",
    "since helicity conservation is equivalent to invariance under generalized duality transformations , having information on the te - tm scattering properties of a system can be used to assess its duality invariance and vice versa .    in systems with a high degree of symmetry , like a sphere or a planar multilayer system , a wise choice of basis simplifies condition ( [ eq : tetmhel ] ) .",
    "the symmetries of those two systems make the te and tm multipoles @xcite and the te and tm plane waves ( definition contained in appendix [ appb ] ) the eigenmodes of the spherical and planar structures respectively .",
    "this means that @xmath92 unless @xmath93 and that @xmath94 for all @xmath71 , @xmath83 .",
    "all the partial scattering matrices are diagonal .",
    "the preservation of the te - tm components is related to the geometrical symmetries of the system .",
    "using mie scattering theory and fresnel s formulas , it is an easy and interesting exercise to analytically verify that , in these two cases , when the materials meet ( [ eq : epsmu ] ) , all the scattering matrices are proportional to the identity ( @xmath95 for all @xmath71 ) , hence preserving helicity as well .",
    "the conversion between spin and orbital angular momentum is widely used to explain phase singularities in numerical simulations of tightly focused fields @xcite , and in scattering experiments : @xcite .",
    "a detailed discussion of the sam to oam conversion can be found in @xcite .",
    "we will now use symmetries and conserved quantities arguments , particularly those related to @xmath19 and @xmath4 , to identify the actual physical reasons for those observations .",
    "we will demonstrate that the mechanism responsible for the presence of optical vortices in focused fields is totally different from the one responsible for the observation of optical vortices in scattering experiments .",
    "this , in our opinion , shows that the sam - oam formulation can be quite misleading : it assigns the same explanation to two distinct physical phenomena .",
    "the analytical tools and methodology employed in this section allow a simple application of the ideas developed in the previous section to practical electromagnetic problems .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath19 and @xmath4 commute . for our analysis",
    "we will need a basis of transverse electromagnetic modes which are simultaneous eigenvectors of @xmath19 and @xmath4 .",
    "one such set of modes is a particular type of bessel beams .",
    "bessel beams have been thoroughly studied .",
    "see for instance the series of papers @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . in appendix",
    "[ appb ] , we constructively derive a complete orthonormal basis for transverse electromagnetic fields consisting of bessel beams with well defined third component of angular momentum @xmath19 and helicity @xmath4 .",
    "these modes appear in @xcite , although their relationship with helicity is not considered in that paper . in @xcite ,",
    "these type of electromagnetic modes are obtained in a different way as linear combinations of other type of more commonly used bessel beams , the transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) modes .",
    "the constructive derivation in appendix [ appb ] shows clearly that the modes are eigenstates of @xmath4 .    from appendix [ appb ] ,",

    "we have already mentioned several times that helicity transforms independently of the geometry of the scatterer . in particular",
    ", it transforms independently of whether the considered system has cylindrical symmetry or not . nevertheless , as seen below , a change in helicity is very clearly identifiable in the spatial patterns of the scattered fields when the system has cylindrical symmetry .",
    "several of the experimental setups and input beams in the articles cited in this section have cylindrical symmetry and are similar to the system in fig .",
    "[ fig : telescope ] , which we will now analyze .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : telescope ] , we distinguish the preparation and measurement apparatus from the focusing and scattering part of the setup . in the preparation stage , a collimated gaussian beam goes through a linear polarizer ( lp ) and quarter wave plate ( qwp ) , which results in a beam with well defined values of @xmath19 and @xmath4 ( see more details below ) . in the central part",
    ", the beam is focused onto a cylindrically symmetric target and the resulting scattered light is collected by another lens .",
    "the measurement part of the setup uses another qwp and lp to project light with different helicity depending on the setting of the lp ( see more details below ) .    at first sight ,",
    "the central part is cylindrically symmetric but lacks translational symmetry in the transverse plane .",
    "we should hence expect conservation of @xmath19 and , as in section ( [ sec : focusing ] ) , non - conservation of @xmath109 . since the lenses preserve helicity , the behavior of the system with respect to @xmath4 depends on whether the target sample meets condition ( [ eq : epsmu ] ) .",
    "let us assume that it does not meet such condition .",
    "let us imagine that , after the first lp and qwp , the input to the first lens is a predominantly rc polarized gaussian beam .",
    "assuming perfect optical elements , and using the same arguments as in section [ sec : focusing ] , we can see that the input beam can be expanded using basis ( [ eq : cd ] ) into modes with @xmath116 and sharp values of @xmath19 , @xmath122 , and of @xmath4 , @xmath125 .",
    "the first lens will focus the beam into the sample without altering either @xmath19 or @xmath4 , then , since it is assumed that the sample does not meet ( [ eq : epsmu ] ) , part of the light will change helicity upon interacting with the cylindrically symmetric target and , after collimation with the second lens , there will be two types of collimated modes , both with @xmath122 , but differing in the value of helicity .",
    "schematically representing the actions of the lenses and the cylindrically symmetric scatterer as transformations of fields expanded in the basis ( [ eq : cd ] ) by coordinates @xmath134 and @xmath135 , we may summarize the whole sequence as :    @xmath136    the corresponding modal expressions for the components of the two types of output modes are : @xmath137    that is , a predominantly rc beam similar to the input , without any phase singularity in @xmath120 and a predominantly lc vortex beam with a singularity of charge two in @xmath129 .",
    "if we set the last lp to project the lc component of the output collimated beam , this vortex will appear in the ccd camera .",
    "we argue that these are the vortices observed in the cylindrically symmetric scattering experiments of ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "2(c)-(d ) ) and @xcite , and that the underlying reason for their appearance is not sam to oam transfer , but that the electromagnetic duality symmetry is broken in those systems .",
    "the samples used in @xcite and @xcite consist of nano - apertures on metallic thin films .",
    "the breaking of duality in a general planar multilayer structure , and in particular when it includes a metal , is clear since the relative electric and magnetic constants of the system will not meet condition ( [ eq : epsmu ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in @xcite , the effect due to the multilayer alone is typically small in terms of helicity conversion .",
    "the reason why the helicity conversion is enhanced making it easily detectable , is that the nano - apertures allow for light to couple to the natural modes of the multilayer system , where duality is strongly broken . in a multilayer system ,",
    "the natural modes are either te or tm resonances . since a mode with well defined helicity has equal contributions from te and tm components ( [ eq : mnaa ] ) , a te only or tm only resonance implies a strong breaking of electromagnetic duality .",
    "the interfaces between a metal and a dielectric allow the existence of surface plasmon polaritons of tm only character .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the influence of these modes in the transmitted light is responsible for the experimentally detectable helicity change .    in @xcite , optical vortices",
    "are observed upon propagation of light through a planar semiconductor microcavity , still a cylindrically symmetric system as noted in that work . in this case",
    ", duality is strongly broken in the multilayer itself by the energy splitting between te and tm modes in the structure .",
    "this splitting is identified in that work as the enabler for sam to oam conversion .",
    "references @xcite and @xcite contain also results for non - cylindrically symmetric setups . even though their study using @xmath19 is not as simple , we are confident that the generality of the methodology that we propose can rid their analysis from the artificial concept of sam to oam conversion , possibly leading to further physical insights . for instance , for the squared nano - apertures studied in @xcite , the same argumentation about the nano - aperture mediated coupling onto strong duality breaking multilayer natural modes applies .",
    "we postulate that any instance where sam to oam conversion is invoked can be properly explained using our framework .",
    "using the helicity of light fields to represent the polarization degrees of freedom , we have introduced a general framework for the study of light beams with angular momentum and their interactions with matter . in particular , the framework does not depend on the applicability of the paraxial approximation .",
    "our proposal is based on two hermitian operators in the hilbert space of transverse electromagnetic fields : the helicity @xmath4 and a component of angular momentum @xmath19 .",
    "these operators are the generators of simple transformations of the fields : generalized electromagnetic duality and rotations along the @xmath57 axis respectively .",
    "since the generalized duality transformation is independent from rotations or translations @xcite , the use of @xmath4 allows to consider the changes in polarization independently from other degrees of freedom like angular momenta ( @xmath36 ) and linear momenta ( @xmath47 ) .",
    "this simplification is crucial for the practical applicability of the framework .",
    "we recall that the approximations implicit in the macroscopic maxwell s equations are assumed in this paper .",
    "we propose this new framework as a substitute of the current state of the art treatment , which is based on the separation of spin and orbital angular momenta for the description of the angular momentum of light , and on the mechanism of sam to oam transfer in light - matter interactions and other situations .",
    "we have shown that it avoids the fundamental problems associated with the separation of sam and oam in a simpler fashion than the current theoretical solutions .",
    "we have also demonstrated its predictive power based on analyzing the broken and unbroken symmetries of the system to predict which properties of the light will change and which ones will be preserved .",
    "the current framework lacks predictive power and , at this point , can only be qualified as a descriptive theory .",
    "this is illustrated by the fact that , using our methodology , we have shown that , phenomena commonly explained as sam to oam transfer in focusing and scattering are actually due to two completely independent physical reasons , showing the inconsistency of the current framework .",
    "the results of this paper suggest that such inconsistency may be related with the use of quantities like sam and oam , which are not valid operators for transverse maxwell fields and hence can not be related to meaningful transformations of the fields .",
    "we are confident that the use of helicity and its associated transformation will become a powerful theoretical and practical tool which will improve the understanding and control of light - matter interactions at the nano - scale .",
    "applications of the ideas presented in this paper can be foreseen in nano - optics , for the control of the shape and polarization of electromagnetic fields , in metrology , for probing the equivalence of the electric and magnetic responses of a system , and in quantum science and technology , where the identification of two truly independently observable degrees of freedom of the field like @xmath4 and @xmath19 should allow to better understand the potential benefits of the use of angular momentum in quantum applications .",

    "the collimated input beam can be expanded in the plane @xmath228 into modes of the type ( [ eq : cparaxial ] ) and ( [ eq : dparaxial ] ) with @xmath116 , which we rewrite here after the change of basis @xmath229 , @xmath230 :      note that in order to avoid confusion with @xmath192 , the letter for the input beam coordinate angle @xmath232 is now @xmath233 , instead of the original letter @xmath52 in expressions ( [ eq : cparaxial ] ) and ( [ eq : dparaxial ] ) .    the sum and subtraction of the above modes result in approximately pure radially and azimuthally polarized modes , which separates the radial and azimuthal components of the field : @xmath234\\exp(i\\phi n)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}{\\mathbf{\\hat{\\rho}}}=a^{\\mathbf{\\hat{\\rho}}}_{n{k_{\\rho}}}(\\rho,\\phi , z_0 ) { \\mathbf{\\hat{\\rho}}},\\\\ { \\mathbf{b}_{n{k_{\\rho}}}}(\\rho,\\phi , z = z_0)&\\approx-\\sqrt{\\frac{2{k_{\\rho}}}{\\pi}}i^{n+2}\\exp(i{k_z}z_0)\\left[j_{n+1}({k_{\\rho}}\\rho)-j_{n+1}({k_{\\rho}}\\rho)\\right]\\exp(i\\phi n)\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}{\\mathbf{\\hat{\\phi}}}=b^{\\mathbf{\\hat{\\phi}}}_{n{k_{\\rho}}}(\\rho,\\phi , z_0 ) { \\mathbf{\\hat{\\phi}}},\\\\ \\end{split}\\ ] ] which means that , ( [ eq : gsgp ] ) is explicitly @xmath235    then , we need to take the partial derivative of the azimuthal and radial input field components @xmath236 and @xmath237 with respect to @xmath183 and divide by @xmath30 .",
    "let us now assume that the input is a field with definite angular momentum @xmath238 .",
    "inspection of ( [ eq : ab ] ) reveals that such operation will leave those components invariant except for a multiplicative factor equal to @xmath22 .",
    "so , the output field is also a field with definite angular momentum equal to @xmath22 .",
    "we have just proved that the aplanatic lens model transfers the @xmath19 value of the input beam to the output beam without changing it .",
    "we now study the behavior of the model with respect to helicity . from ( [ eq : gsgp ] ) , it becomes clear that the te and tm content of the output field are independently determined by the real azimuthal and radial components ( [ eq : ab ] ) of the input field respectively .",
    "having taken linear combinations of modes with defined helicity , and using the results in appendix [ appa ] , it follows that the modes in ( [ eq : ab ] ) are also pure te and tm modes respectively . using the results from section [ sec : scattering ] about helicity preservation in the te tm basis",
    ", we now see that , since there is no cross - talk between the te and tm components of the input and focalized fields , the key condition for helicity preservation in the aplanatic lens model is :        let us assume for a moment a more general dependence of the transmission coefficients @xmath240 .",
    "the new @xmath183 dependence could destroy the @xmath19 preservation since now more terms will be involved in the partial derivatives of @xmath218 and @xmath219 . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as @xmath241 for all @xmath242 , helicity will be preserved .",
    "this is another example of the independence of the conservation laws of @xmath19 and @xmath4 .",
