    "in 1992 a brown dwarf companion search began at palomar with the initiation of a collaboration between t. nakajima and s. kulkarni at caltech and d. golimowski and s. durrance at johns hopkins .",
    "the hopkins group brought the adaptive optics coronagraph ( aoc ; @xcite ) to palomar to be fitted on the 60  telescope .",
    "the first results of this collaboration are given in @xcite , which entailed a search for companions of high galactic latitude stars .",
    "companions were distinguished from background stars through statistical arguments based on the distribution of point sources as a function of angular separation from the stars . in 1994 ,",
    "the work expanded to a new sample of nearby stars which were believed to be young . a short description of this sample is contained in @xcite .",
    "this sample was biased toward young stars in an attempt to discover brown dwarf companions , with the assumption that younger brown dwarfs would be easier to detect because they should be brighter @xcite .",
    "the first success of this collaboration was the discovery of a faint companion of the star gliese 105a @xcite .",
    "the first success of the young star survey was the discovery of the cool brown dwarf gliese 229b @xcite .",
    "following the discovery of gliese 229b , we decided that it was of paramount importance to conduct a volume - limited survey for companions .",
    "if we continued to pursue the biased sample and found no more brown dwarfs , we would have little to say about the prevalence of companion brown dwarfs without extensive modeling .",
    "for this reason , in late 1994 we began a survey of all the northern ( @xmath3 ) stars within 8 pc of the sun to search for brown dwarf companions .",
    "because all of the known stars within 8 pc have measurable proper motions , our survey was designed to find common proper motion companions .",
    "we thus observed each star at multiple epochs , if point sources other than the star appeared in the field of view .",
    "this permitted us to discern companions simply by measuring the relative offset between the star and the putative companions at each epoch .",
    "the common proper motion criterion , almost fifty years old now , is ideal in searches for brown dwarfs because it is intrinsically unbiased by color or other theoretical notions of what a brown dwarf should look like .",
    "( other systematic searches for companions that used the common proper motion criterion are by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a description of the history of brown dwarf searches . )",
    "the common proper motion criterion is the most physically rigorous short - term method for finding companions .",
    "( longer term methods include orbital motion measurements and common parallax measurements , which eliminate the minute possibility that two objects within an arcminute of each other might exhibit common proper motion and yet be physically unassociated . )",
    "this survey is also distinguished from others because it represents the first use of adaptive optics techniques in the study of nearby stars . with our tip - tilt observations dating back to 1992",
    ", we greatly predate any other such searches . at the time of this writing ,",
    "the use of higher order adaptive optics systems is becoming widespread in these sorts of studies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of adaptive optics and coronagraphy , and the use of both infrared and optical band passes made our search effective .",
    "we demonstrate in  9 and fig .",
    "19 that the survey covers previously unobserved parts of the companion mass - separation parameter space .    to achieve our goal of a volume - limited survey",
    ", we assembled a sample of stars which appear in the third catalog of nearby stars @xcite and have parallaxes greater than 0125 .",
    "the degree of completeness of this sample has been the subject of debate .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . )",
    "we address this issue in depth in ",
    "[ chap4:8 pc ] where we also present an updated catalog of the stars within 8 pc .",
    "the observations are explained in detail in ",
    "[ chap4:obs ] , and a complete description of the sensitivity limits is presented in later sections .",
    "when we began our survey the best list of stars within 8 pc of the sun was a subset of the third catalog of nearby stars ( @xcite ; cns3 ) .",
    "the subsequent releases of the hipparcos main catalog @xcite and the yale catalog of trigonometric parallaxes @xcite provide important sets of data that modify the census of stars within 8 pc .",
    "ultimately the two new catalogs moved some stars out of , and others into , the 8 pc sample .",
    "these catalogs also added a few stars to the sample , which were not in the cns3 .",
    "the hipparcos catalog did not add any unknown stars to the 8 pc sample because trigonometric parallaxes were only obtained for previously cataloged stars .",
    "however , hipparcos did measure 7 stars in 5 systems whose parallaxes had never before been measured and which place them within 8 pc .",
    "the yale catalog adds no new stars to the catalog but does provide trigonometric parallaxes for 37 stars within 8 pc which were not measured by hipparcos .",
    "this reduces the number of stars in our sample whose parallaxes are simply inferred from photometry .",
    "these so - called photometric parallaxes involve measurements of the colors of a given star .",
    "the colors determine the spectral class of the star and , thus , its absolute luminosity . from the absolute luminosity ,",
    "the distance modulus is calculated .",
    "these photometric parallaxes are sometimes inaccurate because of unknown multiplicity and intrinsic scatter in the main sequence which can lead to errors in the distance as large as 30% @xcite . in the new catalog",
    "we assemble here , only 6 stars are included based on photometric parallaxes .",
    "these are the only stars within 8 pc in the cns3 which were not measured astrometrically by the hipparcos or the yale surveys .    pursuant to this discussion",
    "we have created a new catalog of stars within 8 pc of the sun .",
    "we believe this comprises the most complete census of the northern 8 pc volume to date .",
    "in our catalog we combine all the stars within the cns3 , hipparcos and yale catalogs which have parallaxes greater than 0125 . the three catalogs are fully cross - correlated and for each entry in our database we have up to three different parallaxes , although only the most accurate is listed in the catalog presented here .",
    "precedence for inclusion in the final catalog is given to the hipparcos measurement which is generally more accurate than the yale measurement ( except in the case of star systems gliese 185ab and gliese 644abcd , where the yale parallax is more accurate ) . for six of the stars neither yale nor hipparcos measurements exist .",
    "these stars have photometric parallaxes listed in the cns3 and we list them to be as inclusive as possible .    to be certain that we have included all the known subordinate stellar and substellar objects associated with these stars",
    ", we conducted a search of the literature .",
    "two papers in particular @xcite provided new companions , some of which have been resolved and some of which were detected through radial velocity studies .",
    "our catalog is not biased in any way as to whether a given companion has been visually resolved .",
    "a complete census must be free of these considerations .",
    "therefore , we include all of the companions mentioned in @xcite and most of those in @xcite .",
    "we believe that our final catalog is complete as of january 2000 because we have used all of the available resources and studies of the nearby stars .",
    "our sample includes , therefore , 163 stars , two brown dwarfs @xcite and one indirectly detected planet @xcite .",
    "these entities are arranged in 111 star systems , 29 of which are double , nine of which are triple , two of which is quadruple and one of which is quintuple .",
    "table [ chap4:tab1 ] lists all the star systems in the 8 pc sample described above . in this table",
    "we give a single entry for every object known within 8 pc . for multiple systems",
    ", entries are grouped together and indicate the separation of the subordinate components , along with other vital data .",
    "the table is arranged in order of decreasing parallax in milliarcseconds ( mas ) .",
    "the `` source code '' field in each entry indicates where the parallax measurement comes from .",
    "companions of stars are indicated by capital roman letters after the parallax and generally are given in the order in which the components are discovered . an implicit a",
    "is given to every principal star in each star system .",
    "however , the a is only used if at least component b has been discovered . for convenience",
    "we give hd , durchmusterung , cns3 or other names for the stars if they are available .",
    "this permits easy identification of the stars in astronomical databases .",
    "it is important before describing the observations we undertook to estimate how complete our catalog of star systems within 8 pc is .",
    "the simplest way to assess this involves extrapolating the number of stars within 5 pc to the volume of the 8 pc sample .",
    "this sort of analysis was conducted by @xcite . in their estimation , the cns3 is complete for stars with @xmath4 all the way out to 10 pc , although the majority of the incompleteness is in the far - less - studied southern sky ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "their computation involves taking the densities of stars of various absolute magnitudes in the 5 pc volume in the cns3 ( widely used as a benchmark for complete stellar samples ) and multiplying by the ratio of the volumes due to increasing the radius of the sample .",
    "the 5 pc sample in the cns3 contains 53 stars with @xmath6 .",
    "this implies that there should be another @xmath7 stars between 5 and 8 pc .",
    "however , there are only 110 such stars known .",
    "since we surveyed 163 stars but expect those to be drawn from a population of 217 @xmath8 30 , we estimate that our catalog is complete to approximately 75%  ( assuming the stellar densities within 5 pc are correct ) .",
    "any incompleteness is most likely among the very faintest stars ( white dwarfs and late m dwarfs ) , because they are less likely to have been measured and studied in depth in large scale stellar surveys .",
    "in addition , many of the nearby stars were found through large - scale proper motion surveys .",
    "some stars may therefore be missing from the nearby star sample because they have very small proper motions .",
    "@xcite argue that the cns3 is complete to @xmath9 for @xmath10 within 10 pc .",
    "@xmath11 corresponds to the spectral type m4.5 .",
    "these considerations permit us to conclude that our sample is complete at least to the spectral type m5 , and possibly even fainter .",
    "we conservatively claim that the sample is 75%  complete and believe that the missing stars are all later than m5 in spectral type .",
    "in pursuit of our goal to image and study brown dwarf companions of stars in our sample , we conducted observations of 107 of the 111 star systems ( 96%  of the sample ) in optical and near infrared wavelengths .",
    "the observations employed two different imaging instruments , the aoc attached to the palomar 60  telescope and the cassegrain infrared camera fitted to the palomar 200  hale telescope .",
    "we imaged each of the stars at least twice in order to discern faint objects within 30  of each star which display the same proper motion as the stars themselves .",
    "our decision to use the common proper motion criterion was motivated by the plethora of models of brown dwarfs at the time the survey began .",
    "these models painted often conflicting depictions of the colors or spectra that brown dwarfs ought to exhibit .",
    "( see @xcite for a comprehensive review of the state of these models at about the time that our survey began . )",
    "we decided that instead of relying upon one of the models and designing a survey that looked for colors that such a model predicted , we would use a more basic physical argument for finding cool companions .",
    "the technique we employ here is explained through example in fig.[fig : c4f1 ] .",
    "this figure shows four @xmath2 band coronagraphic images of the star gliese 105a ( 138.72ac ) .",
    "the first two images are magnified portions of the region immediately around the star .",
    "these two images were taken a year apart and show a faint second object with the same proper motion",
    ". the star moves 22 yr@xmath12 permitting extremely easy discrimination between common proper motion companions and background stars .",
    "this is demonstrated in the bottom two images , which are larger portions of the same images . in these two",
    ", one can clearly see that the two stars to the west do not share the proper motion of the star .",
    "we reported this common proper motion companion in the paper by @xcite .",
    "the error in the measurement of the centroid of a stellar image on a ccd is approximately the angular size of the image divided by the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "( there is a correction factor if the pixel size is much smaller than the image size , but this amounts to a 0.6%correction in this survey .",
    "this is because we require every star to be imaged in 1  seeing or better . ) in our survey we combine @xmath13 measurements of each star to improve upon this standard astrometric limit .",
    "the effective signal - to - noise ratio of the combined measurement is improved by the factor @xmath14 . at each epoch",
    "we have at least two images . with at least two epochs per star , the value of @xmath13 for most stars is greater than four .",
    "the average value of @xmath13 for all the stars in the survey with other point sources in the field of view is eight .",
    "this means that the average centroid error for sources detected at the 5 @xmath15 level is 007 .",
    "all of the stars in our sample exhibit proper motions greater than 007 yr@xmath12 .",
    "thus we are capable of discerning background objects from common proper motion companions with these observations . in most cases , the proper motions are actually substantially larger than 007 yr@xmath12 and the requirement on the astrometric errors is far less stringent than 007 .",
    "optical coronagraphic images of the survey stars were obtained during 25 separate observing runs on the palomar 60  telescope between september 1992 and april 1999 .",
    "these images were obtained with a tektronix 1024 @xmath16 1024 pixel ccd camera binned in a 2 @xmath16 2 pattern ( 0117 pixel@xmath12 ) attached to the back - end of the aoc .",
    "this device consists of a standard lyot coronagraph @xcite fitted behind a tip - tilt mirror which uses the occulted star as a guide star .",
    "the tip - tilt correction provides substantial gains in image resolution on the palomar 60  telescope because , there , the majority of the atmospheric disruption of the stellar wavefront resides in tip - tilt energy or , equivalently , image motion .",
    "we routinely obtained images with resolutions of 07 and on six of the observing runs we obtained images at 045 resolution .",
    "the images were taken through the gunn @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters , with additional images taken through the @xmath17 band if a companion was found . in almost all cases",
    "the ccd was exposed for 1000 s. however , for the stars whose magnitude is @xmath18 , we were forced to take shorter exposures and to sum these to produce a final image with a 1000 s exposure time .",
    "the aoc on the 60  telescope was incapable of guiding on stars fainter than @xmath19 .",
    "for this reason we were unable to observe 13 of the sample stars with the aoc .",
    "we had to rely upon the infrared observations of these stars to discern companions .",
    "these stars are indicated by the words `` too faint '' in table [ chap4:tab2 ] .",
    "the aoc s focal plane aluminum occulting stop is uniformly translucent in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands .",
    "this permits an accurate measurement of the position of the star in the ccd image .",
    "( without the transparent stop , pinpointing the star would have been impossible because the pupil plane stop eliminates the diffraction spikes of the star . )",
    "we used coronagraphic stops 42 in diameter for most observations , except in the case of the brightest stars where an 84 diameter stop was used .",
    "we claim no sensitivity to faint companions under the stops .",
    "however , equal brightness binaries were sometimes resolved under the masks ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig:089 ] ) .    if a set of @xmath1 and @xmath2 band images failed to reveal any sources in the field of view other than the star , we would not reobserve the star .",
    "table [ chap4:tab2 ] lists the dates of all the observations of each star in the sample . in all cases we attempted to acquire images with seeing better than 10 .",
    "seeing worse than this strongly degraded our sensitivity (  [ chap4:sens ] ) . in all cases we were able to obtain such images at least once for each of the stars observed , and at least twice for those stars with possible companions ( i.e. , with any other point source in the field of view ) .",
    "data reduction involved the subtraction of a bias frame from each of the science images , division by a flat field image obtained using the 60  dome and a flat field lamp , and the removal of cosmic rays ( easy to identify in these images because of the very small plate scale ) .",
    "the images were then inspected by eye . in most cases this was sufficient to ascertain whether common proper motion companions were present . however , for the stars whose proper motions are small , additional work was required to distinguish field stars from common proper motion objects . because the central occulting mask of the coronagraph was somewhat transparent",
    ", we were able to centroid the light of the survey star to ascertain its position in the images .",
    "simple centroiding of the other point sources yielded pixel locations as well .",
    "these were converted into angular separations in arcseconds by using the observing run s plate scale and detector orientation .",
    "these were determined with the astrometric calibrator fields as explained in ",
    "[ sec : astrom ] .",
    "direct infrared images of each of the sample stars were obtained with the d78 cassegrain infrared camera on the palomar 200  telescope during 15 observing runs between may 1995 and march 1999 .",
    "we allowed the stars to saturate the central part of the 256 @xmath16 256 insb array ( 0125 pixel@xmath12 ) .",
    "the field of view in these images was approximately 32  our imaging technique entailed the use of the j and k filters with two types of exposure through each filter .",
    "the first type involved a total of five coadds of 1 s exposure time .",
    "these images were meant to reveal close binaries with a dynamic range on the order of five to eight magnitudes ( depending on the seeing ) . the second type of exposure used five coadds of 10 s. these exposures",
    "were designed to detect fainter companions outside of a 3  radius from the star . in each case a sky frame was taken immediately after the data image was acquired .",
    "the sky frame was taken in the same manner as the data image , but with the telescope pointed 50  to the n or e. in some cases we changed this distance because of the presence of a rather bright source in the sky frame .",
    "as with the optical observations , if no objects other than the star appeared , we would not observe the star a second time . in addition the seeing requirement of @xmath20 10 for the infrared observations was identical to that for the optical images ( see above ) .",
    "the data reduction for the infrared images involved the subtraction of the sky frame from the `` on - source '' frame .",
    "subsequent division by a flat field ( acquired from the twilight sky during each observing run ) permitted the more detailed examination of the images .",
    "as with the optical data , visual inspection of the images was usually enough to discern common proper motion companions . in cases where more accurate measurements were necessary , we needed to pinpoint the location of the survey star .",
    "this could not be done through centroiding because all of the stars s images were saturated .",
    "fortunately , we could use the diffraction spikes in the infrared images ( absent in the optical images because of the pupil plane apodizing mask in the coronagraph ) . by fitting the unsaturated parts of the two diffraction spikes with perpendicular lines",
    ", we were able to localize the star with an accuracy of better than a third of a pixel .",
    "( we confirmed this through short unsaturated exposures of some of the fainter stars in the sample while the telescope guided on a field star . the low frequency tip - tilt system on the f/70 secondary mirror of the 200 ",
    "telescope guides with an accuracy of better than 003 over 20 min . )",
    "this stellar position on the detector was then used , along with centroids of the light from putative companions , to compute offsets between the objects .",
    "these were converted into angular offsets in arcseconds by using the plate scale as described in  [ sec : astrom ] .      in order to obtain the accurate astrometric measurements of the offsets between the central star and its putative companions , we made observations of calibration fields during each observing run .",
    "these fields contained six to ten stars whose relative positions are known within a few milliarcseconds .",
    "we used these fields to determine that the astrometric distortion on the face of the ccd chip used in the aoc observations is smaller than 001 over the whole chip . in the infrared observations the distortion is almost a full pixel near the edges of the array .",
    "this distortion is constant with time .",
    "because we centered the stars in the same position on the infrared array at each observing run , the comparison of astrometric measurements is valid , despite this image distortion .",
    "we did not use relative astrometry measured on the infrared images in conjunction with other measurements made on the aoc images . for these reasons we applied no astrometric distortion correction in our measurements of relative offsets between stars .    for all of the infrared observing runs",
    ", the data were taken with the cassegrain ring angle precisely set to place north up and east left on the array .",
    "this prevented complications in astrometric measurements that would arise from using arbitrary position angles of the array with respect to the cardinal directions .    for every aoc observing run we would observe whichever of the three astrometric calibration fields ( listed in tables [ chap4:tab4 ] , [ chap4:tab5 ] and [ chap4:tab6 ] ) was visible . in each case",
    "we would place the star shown in the center of each of figs.[fig : astrofieldtrap ] , [ fig : astrofieldm5 ] and [ fig : astrofieldm15 ] in the center of the field of view .",
    "this star was used for guiding and rapid tip - tilt image motion compensation . from the images500 s @xmath1 band exposures",
    " we were able to determine precisely the plate scale and the rotation of the ccd on the plane of the sky .",
    "we found that the plate scale was extremely stable in both instruments ( despite the fact that the ccd camera used on the aoc was taken apart and reassembled twice between the starting and ending dates of the survey ) .",
    "the accurate positions of the stars in these fields are from @xcite for m5 , @xcite for m15 and @xcite for the trapezium",
    ".    figs .",
    "[ fig : astrofieldtrap ] , [ fig : astrofieldm5 ] and [ fig : astrofieldm15 ] show each of the three calibration fields and tables [ chap4:tab4 ] , [ chap4:tab5 ] and [ chap4:tab6 ] give the positions of the stars used for the astrometric calibration .",
    "typically in imaging surveys assessing the sensitivity of the images and the survey as a whole simply involves a determination of the limiting magnitudes of the images . however , in this case the problem is somewhat more complicated .",
    "the presence of the bright star in our images means that over much of the field of view the sensitivity is limited by the light of the star and not the sky background ( or read noise as was the case for speckle interferometric surveys of these stars ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , this survey extends into uncharted parameter space because the coronagraphic technique suppresses a substantial portion of the starlight . the image shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c4f2 ] illustrates this with the gliese 105 ac system .",
    "we have measured the detection limits for each star in the survey as a function of angular separation from the central star . to do this we took the images of each star with 10 seeing or better  the acquisition of such images was a survey requirement (  [ chap4:obs])and inserted artificial point sources at an array of separations from the star .",
    "these artificial point sources were generated with appropriate poisson noise statistics and angular sizes to match the seeing conditions .",
    "the magnitudes of these artificial stars ( calibrated to the photometric standards used during the relevant observing run ) were set so that each artificial star was just visible to the eye . from these magnitudes ,",
    "the sensitivity curve is derived .",
    "an example of this is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : sensimg ] .    from this procedure , we had a measurement of the faintest source visible at a set of about 10 to 15 radii from the star . using a spline interpolation between these points , we derived the magnitude limit for @xmath1 , @xmath2 and j as a function of radius measured from the star . in each band",
    "we have individual curves of this nature for each central star in the survey .",
    "these curves are summarized in figs.[fig : sensitr ] , [ fig : sensitz ] and [ fig : sensitj ] , where we have displayed representative curves for various star brightnesses in each bandpass .",
    "there are several important effects documented by the curves in figs.[fig : sensitr ] , [ fig : sensitz ] and [ fig : sensitj ] .",
    "the most obvious is that the @xmath2 band imaging is the most sensitive , achieving a maximum dynamic range of 15.5 magnitudes at 10 , while , in addition , even the brightest companions can be imaged inside the 5  radius . in comparison ,",
    "the j band has no sensitivity at the 5  radius for the bright stars and only achieves a maximum dynamic range of 13 magnitudes .",
    "what is even more important is the large , slowly - eroding wing of the point spread function in the j band .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bands do not have nearly as much of this broad wing primarily because of the pupil - plane stop in the coronagraph .",
    "this stop is designed specifically to depress the wings of the stellar point spread function .",
    "from the observational point of view , the curves in figs.[fig : sensitr ] , [ fig : sensitz ] and [ fig : sensitj ] are the ultimate measure of the sensitivity of our survey .",
    "these curves parameterize the sensitivity for every star in the sample . however , it is of paramount importance to convert the information in figs.[fig : sensitr ] , [ fig : sensitz ] and [ fig : sensitj ] into statements about the survey as a whole and in terms of physical , not observational , parameters .",
    "for example , can we safely claim with this data that for all the stars within 8 pc we would have detected _ any _ unknown stellar companions in orbits between 3 and 200 au ?    to address this issue , we use the curves found in the previous section to determine the number of surveyed stars for which we could have detected a companion of a given magnitude at a given separation .",
    "this information is expressed in terms of the fraction ( or percentage ) of the total number of stars imaged as a function of magnitude and physical separation in au . to do this",
    ", we systematically went through the catalog of stars . for each star",
    ", we took the relevant sensitivity curve , as derived in the previous section , and converted the magnitude scale into absolute magnitudes , using the parallax of the star .",
    "we also converted the angular scale into physical separation in au by dividing by the parallax in arcseconds .",
    "then , we tested whether companions with a set of magnitudes in each band and a set of separations would be visible in our images . by doing this exercise for every star observed , we ended up with a tally of the number of stars , as a function of magnitude and separation , for which the analysis showed that a companion would be visible .",
    "this analysis was done for each of the @xmath1 , @xmath2 and j bands .",
    "( the k band sensitivity curves are essentially identical to the j band curves so we did not independently conduct this analysis for k band . )",
    "the results are shown in tables [ tab : jmag ] , [ tab : zmag ] and [ tab : rmag ] .",
    "the drop off in the survey sensitivity at large physical companion separations is due to the varying physical field of view caused by the distribution of parallaxes of the stars in the survey . in the j band",
    "there is no sensitivity outside of 120 a.u .",
    ", for example , because the field of view is 15  and the minimum parallax is 125 mas .    in tables [ tab : jmag ] through [ tab : rmag ] , we have drawn a horizontal line at the approximate absolute magnitude of a 0.08 m@xmath21 star . if the hydrogen burning mass limit is 0.08 m@xmath21 , then all stellar companions must be brighter than the absolute magnitude indicated by the line .",
    "brown dwarfs can be brighter than this line if they are young , but objects below this line must be brown dwarfs and not stars .",
    "there are some indications that the hydrogen burning mass limit may not be 0.08 m@xmath21 .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein for observational evidence .",
    "we now extend the analysis from the previous section . instead of discussing the survey sensitivity in terms of observational quantities , we relate those quantities to known properties of stars .",
    "this allows us to determine the ability of the survey to find stellar companions of the survey stars . a stellar companion at the minimum mass for hydrogen burning ( 0.08 m@xmath21 ; burrows et al .",
    "1997 ) has absolute magnitudes of @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "these magnitudes are determined by averaging the photometry of several of the objects known to be at the minimum stellar mass @xcite .",
    "( it is important to note , however , that the exact location of the `` hydrogen burning mass limit '' is not precisely known .",
    "for example , @xcite suggest that some l - dwarfs might be hydrogen burning and yet have masses below 0.08 m@xmath21 . )",
    "we now use these measurements to make a single table showing the sensitivity to a minimum mass star in each of the bandpasses .",
    "the result is shown in table [ tab : hbml ] .",
    "what this table demonstrates is that the combination of the infrared and optical imaging permits the detection of any stellar companion at separations greater than 10 au .",
    "we note that for the smaller separations , j band is most sensitive .",
    "@xmath2 band is more sensitive than j band at the higher separations .",
    "this is primarily due to the drop in coverage at large separations in the j band ( where the field of view is only 32 ) .",
    "indeed , we have detected six new stellar companions of these stars .",

    "the use of gliese 229b photometry ( matthews et al .",

    "this is presented in table [ tab:229b ] .",
    "we use gliese 229b as a template cool brown dwarf because of all the cool brown dwarfs , it is the most comprehensively studied @xcite . the only other one with a known parallax is gliese 570d @xcite , but its photometry is not as comprehensively measured .",
    "the contrast between table [ tab:229b ] and [ tab : hbml ] is quite dramatic .",
    "the survey has no sensitivity to cool brown dwarfs in the @xmath1 band .",
    "this is principally because in this band the absolute magnitude of the template brown dwarf , gliese 229b , is 24.6 ( golimowski et al .",
    "1998 ) , while the images were limited to , at best , 21.7 .",
    "the survey is most sensitive to brown dwarf companions in the @xmath2 band at the wider separations and in the j band for separations @xmath20 40 au .",
    "this is due to the suppression of the broad wings of the point spread function by the pupil - plane coronagraphic stop .",
    "brown dwarfs in orbits with separations between 50 and 100 au would have been detected around more than 80% of the stars in the survey .",
    "ultimately we would like to express the sensitivity of the survey in terms of what the lowest mass brown dwarf we could possibly detect is .",
    "this is complicated by the fact that brown dwarfs cool . as such",
    ", a brown dwarf of a given mass will evolve through many magnitudes of brightness in a given bandpass over the time scale of several billion years .",

    "( 1997 , 2000 ; personal communication ) supply us with the magnitudes in the @xmath2 and j bands for brown dwarfs of all masses ( 15 m@xmath26 to 70 m@xmath26 ) for two different ages , 1 and 5 gyr . from this information",
    "we can convert the absolute magnitudes in tables [ tab : zmag ] and [ tab : jmag ] into brown dwarf masses for each of the two ages , 1 and 5 gyr .",
    "the results are shown in tabular and graphical form : tables [ tab : zmag5 ] through [ tab : jmag1 ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : zmag5 ] through [ fig : jmag1 ] .",
    "we should note that the two ages chosen here are unfortunately not perfectly representative of the ages of the sample stars . assuming a constant star formation rate in the galaxy , the ages of stars in the disk would be evenly distributed between 0 and 10 gyr .",
    "unfortunately we do not have model flux densities for 10 gyr objects .",
    "* caveat *    we do not separately evaluate the conversion between j magnitudes and mass and k band magnitudes and mass because the measurements in the two bands yields essentially identical masses . as we mentioned above (  [ chap4:senstar ] ) , the sensitivity curves for k band are the same as those for j band .",
    "what is becoming increasingly clear from the searches for field brown dwarfs , such as the two - micron all - sky survey @xcite , is that brown dwarfs greatly outnumber stars in the field population .",
    "it would seem to follow logically that many stars could have brown dwarf companions , if the formation mechanism for binary stars applies to star - brown dwarf systems .",
    "however , we have shown here that brown dwarfs seem to have a multiplicity fraction with stars far below the 17 to 30%  observed for all stars @xcite .",
    "between 40 and 100 au , we would have detected brown dwarfs more massive than 40 m@xmath26 , around 80%  of the survey stars .",
    "the only other cool brown dwarf companion of a star within 8 pc is gliese 570d @xcite .",
    "we did not detect this object because the separation is @xmath27 4 arcmin , placing it outside our field of view .",
    "the initial goal of this survey was to find brown dwarfs .",
    "however , because we found only one , and because our survey detection limits are complex functions of brightness , separation and age , placing constraints on possible mass and separation distributions of brown dwarf companions requires extensive monte carlo simulations . this is a rather complex problem which requires its own computational techniques .",
    "this work is currently in progress and will be published in a separate paper .",
    "this survey would have found all stellar companions of any type around 98%  of the survey stars and between 3 and 30  of the stars . indeed in  [ sec : comp ] we present 6 new stellar companions .",
    "this does not dramatically change the multiplicity fraction for the 8 pc sample .",
    "brown dwarfs more massive than 40 m@xmath26 , at least as old as 5 gyr , would have been detected around 80% of the survey stars for separations between 40 and 120 a.u .",
    "only one such object exists ( gliese 229b , at @xmath28 39 a.u . ) , implying a binary fraction of around 1% , assuming that gliese 229b is a prototypical brown dwarf .",
    "( we must note here that the exclusion of models of older brown dwarfs in this assertion must be considered when interpreting the result .",
    "a proper assessment of the constraints provided by our survey on the binary fraction of brown dwarfs really requires extensive modeling of the possible populations of stars and brown dwarf companions . )",
    "there has been no complete assessment of the population of brown dwarf companions of the survey stars for separations outside 100 a.u . the most complete study to date",
    "has been that of simons et al.(1996 ) , but it did not cover the whole sample and turned up no new brown dwarfs . our survey is insensitive to such wide separation binaries . however the 2mass project @xcite should reveal all companions of the known nearby stars with wide separations that are similar to or hotter than gliese 229b .",
    ". a more sensitive survey of the same stars in the sample presented here is necessary to obtain a complete census of brown dwarf companions in the solar neighborhood .",
    "this requires the suppression of scattered light from the primary stars ( i.e.  achieving a higher dynamic range ) and an increase in the limiting magnitude of the sky - limited regions of the images .",
    "the next step in this sort of research is a full - scale , adaptive - optics - based survey , ideally with simultaneous infrared and optical imaging .      in  [ chap4:sens ] we addressed the issue of how sensitive the survey is as a whole and for individual stars .",
    "ideally these calculations and observations should be gathered into a general statement about brown dwarf companions of nearby stars .",
    "this turns out to be a rather complex problem with a large and essentially unexplored parameter space .",
    "it is unexplored not only from the observational standpoint but essentially no research has been conducted on the theoretical aspects of the problem .    from the observational standpoint ,",
    "the search for faint or low - mass companions of stars has only become practical in the past five to ten years .",
    "the two approaches to the problem  direct and indirect detection  have turned up positive results , but each has access to a different part of the parameter space .",
    "the parameter space is defined by mass of the companion and orbital separation .",
    "this seems simple enough , but as shown in the previous section the sensitivity of a direct observing campaign is not a constant through any region of this parameter space when the mass is below the `` hydrogen burning limit . ''",
    "this is particularly true because brown dwarfs cool .",
    "the cooling essentially introduces an additional parameter , the age . in the case of the indirect",
    "searches the sensitivity to mass is uninfluenced by age , but the parameter space is also explored in a non - uniform manner for a large sample of stars : it depends mainly upon the length of time over which the observations are scattered for each star and how they are distributed in time .",
    "for example , periodic observations will be completely insensitive to objects which orbit with a multiple of the period of observation .",
    "the point of this discussion is that the mass - separation parameter space is poorly sampled , and making direct comparisons between the direct and indirect observing methods is difficult because the overlap in parameter space is only now beginning to exist . the simplest comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : radial ] , where the mass - separation parameter space is shown with lines indicating sensitivity limits of various search techniques .",
    "the only complete imaging survey on the plot is that presented in this paper .",
    "the only certain statement we can make at this time is that the multiplicity fraction of brown dwarfs is far smaller than the 35 to 40%  for stellar binary systems . in light of this",
    "it is important to discuss the mass function .",
    "the mass function below the `` hydrogen burning limit '' has been the subject of heated debate and has mainly relied upon observational rather than theoretical constraints .",
    "( i.e. this part of the mass function can not be calculated theoretically at present . ) in the past ten years it has become clear that the salpeter mass function , which works for higher mass stars , does not apply to the very lowest mass stars .",
    "recently , studies of open star clusters such as the pleiades , which probe into the brown dwarf mass range , have begun to provide extensions of the mass function .",
    "( see , for example , martn et al .  1998 . )",
    "however , the masses of the objects discovered are generally not well - constrained because the theoretical models of these objects are not complete and unable to reproduce all of the observations . other techniques for finding brown dwarfs in the field , such as the microlensing experiments , give accurate masses , but have found such a sparse number of objects in the brown dwarf mass range that the error bars on the implied mass distribution are large . a careful analysis of the macho results ( alcock et al .  1998 )",
    "is presented by chabrier and mra ( 1998 ) and `` clearly illustrates the difficulty to reach robust conclusions about the mass in the form of substellar objects in the central regions of the galaxy , and more precisely , in the disk and the bulge , from present microlensing experiments . ''",
    "indeed , chabrier and mra can not constrain the space density of brown dwarfs to a range smaller than an order of magnitude around 9 @xmath16 10@xmath29 m@xmath21 pc@xmath29 .",
    "a further complication of this problem stems from the observation , most recently by reid and gizis ( 1997 ) and reid et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , that the mass function for companions is actually different from the mass function of field stars . in their analysis of the 8 pc sample , they find that the distribution of the mass ratios of multiple systems has a significant peak near 0.95 . in their estimation",
    "this excludes the notion that companions of stars come from the same mass function as solitary stars .",
    "for a survey of the nature presented here , this makes drawing conclusions about the various mass functions described above essentially irrelevant .",
    "it would be akin to trying to understand techno music by listening to classical violin concertos .",
    "there has been no study of companion mass functions in the brown dwarf regime .",
    "furthermore , if the mass ratio distribution that reid and gizis ( 1997 ) find extends into the brown dwarf mass range , our survey excludes the most important set of stars to find brown dwarf companions of : we argued that the 25%  incompleteness of our sample is all due to missing the very lowest mass stars within 8 pc .",
    "these are the ones that would be expected to have more brown dwarf companions .",

    "<S> we present the technique and results of a survey of stars within 8 pc of the sun with declinations @xmath0 ( j2000.00 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the survey , designed to find without color bias faint companions , consists of optical coronagraphic images of the 1  field of view centered on each star and infrared direct images with a 32  field of view . </S>",
    "<S> the images were obtained through the optical gunn @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters and the infrared j and k filters . </S>",
    "<S> the survey achieves sensitivities up to four absolute magnitudes fainter than the prototype brown dwarf , gliese 229b . </S>",
    "<S> however , this sensitivity varies with the seeing conditions , the intrinsic brightness of the star observed and the angular distance from the star . as a result we tabulate sensitivity limits for each star in the survey . </S>",
    "<S> we used the criterion of common proper motion to distinguish companions and to determine their luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the brown dwarf gliese 229b , we have identified 6 new stellar companions of the sample stars . since the survey began , accurate trigonometric parallax measurements for most of the stars have become available . as a result </S>",
    "<S> some of the stars we originally included should no longer be included in the 8 pc sample . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the 8 pc sample is incomplete at the faint end of the main sequence complicating our calculation of the binary fraction of brown dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> we assess the sensitivity of the survey to stellar companions and to brown dwarf companions of various masses and ages . </S>"
