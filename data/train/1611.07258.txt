    "we cover the vertices of a certain weighted graph directly related to @xmath99 by disjoint edges and paths of even vertex length in such a way that the _ total weight _ of any independent set in any of these graphs is at most half of the total weight of the set of vertices of that subgraph .",

    "that is , the vertices of @xmath53 are @xmath114 and the vertices from different parts are connected iff there are two sets from the corresponding orbits that intersect in less than @xmath4 elements .",
    "we also put weights on each vertex of @xmath53 equal to the cardinality of the corresponding orbit .",
    "thus , in view of lemma [ lemorbit ] , it is enough for us to show that one part of @xmath53 has the same weight as the heaviest independent set in @xmath53 .",

    "we call the value of @xmath47 _ meaningful _ if the resulting indices of all families depending on @xmath47 lie in the set @xmath120 .",
    "we need the following technical lemma .                  in the first fraction",
    "the number of factors in both denominator and numerator is the same and is at most @xmath138 , as shown in the computation three lines above .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath139-st factors in the first fraction , that is , the expression @xmath140 for @xmath141 is at most @xmath9 and thus does not increase as @xmath50 increases .    in the second fraction",
    "the number of factors in both the numerator and denominator is @xmath138 .",
    "similarly to the first fraction , the expression @xmath142 for @xmath141 is at least @xmath9 and thus does not decrease as @xmath50 increases .",
    "therefore , the product of these two fractions is at least      the last inequality holds since without integer parts the denominator is equal to the enumerator , and the possible gain because of the integer parts in the denominator is at most @xmath145 .",
    "however , both numbers are integer , thus the denominator is not bigger than the enumerator .",
    "+ assume now that @xmath146 .",
    "bounding the two fractions similarly to how it was done in the previous case , one can see that this expression is at least @xmath150 @xmath151 as in the previous case , in the last fraction the denominator is equal to the enumerator if one removes all integer parts , and as in the previous case we conclude that the last inequality is valid .",
    "+ 0.2 cm the next crucial step is to decompose the graph @xmath53 into symmetric chains of even length .",

    "1 , where the two parts are represented by two horizontal lines of points , and the values near the points indicate the size of the intersection of the corresponding family with @xmath91 $ ] .",
    "the arrows on the edges indicate the direction from the vertex of smaller weight to the vertex of larger weight .",
    "the black two - directional edges are the edges of the second type and connect the vertices of the same weight .",
    "the vertical edges are the edges of the first type , and the other edges are the edges of the third type .",
    "the middle vertical line corresponds to the size of the intersection with @xmath91 $ ] equal to @xmath162 in both parts .",
    "the two dashed lines correspond to the intersection size @xmath163 for one of the parts . between these two lines",
    "each vertex has an edge of the second type .",
    "note that the starting vertex of the edges of the third type is always outside the region bounded between the two dashed lines .",
    "the edges of the third type may or may not intersect the dashed lines , but they never intersect the black line .        in the middle of each path",
    "@xmath164 there is an edge of the second type , connecting two vertices of the same weight . due to lemma [ lemcoeff ] , for each path the weight of the vertex does not decrease as we move along the path towards the middle edge of the second type .",
