    "the origin of the matter anti - matter asymmetry in the universe is one of the most important open questions in particle physics and cosmology .",
    "leptogenesis  @xcite is among the most plausible possible mechanisms for generating the observed baryon asymmetry dynamically in the early universe .",
    "the recent discovery of a standard model ( sm ) like higgs boson provides further support for this mechanism , where the asymmetry is generated by out - of - equilibrium decays of heavy sterile right - handed neutrinos into a higgs boson and a lepton .    in recent years",
    ", substantial progress was made in the theoretical description of leptogenesis using non - equilibrium quantum field theory in the closed time path ( ctp ) formalism  @xcite .",
    "particular attention was given to the derivation of quantum evolution equations for distribution functions  @xcite , the calculation of thermal corrections to the charge - parity ( @xmath13 ) asymmetry  @xcite , and related questions  @xcite .",
    "interaction rates mediated by higgs - yukawa couplings are crucial for leptogenesis predictions .",
    "the production and decay rates of the lightest right - handed neutrino determine the strength of the washout , and they are mediated by their yukawa couplings @xmath14 to sm lepton doublets and higgs bosons , while the lepton flavour equilibration rate determines the temperature scale where flavour effects become relevant for calculations of the asymmetry  @xcite , and it is mediated by the sm lepton yukawa couplings @xmath15 .    at low temperatures , both processes",
    "[ right - handed neutrino ( inverse ) decays and flavour equilibration ] are described at leading order ( lo ) through @xmath16 processes , namely decays and inverse decays , involving only the higgs boson and left- and right - handed leptons and sterile neutrinos . at high temperatures ,",
    "both rates are phase space suppressed .",
    "therefore a complete lo calculation of these crucial interactions must include processes where additional gauge bosons are emitted or absorbed or where an intermediate higgs boson decays into a pair of top quarks .",
    "for right - handed neutrino ( inverse ) decays , the lo analysis pertinent to high temperatures has first been performed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in some earlier and also more recent papers  @xcite",
    ", the inclusion of the gauge interactions is restricted to the effect of the modified thermal dispersion relations ( thermal masses ) , but these approaches should only partly capture the lo effects .",
    "closely related to the problem of right - handed neutrino production and the relaxation of the flavour correlations of active leptons is the production of photons in a quark - gluon plasma , which is calculated _",
    "e.g. _ in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "gauge boson corrections in the low temperature regime have recently received some attention in the works  @xcite , where a non - relativistic analysis including leading relativistic corrections has been performed .",
    "when the right - handed neutrino mass can not be neglected , the tree - level scattering amplitudes exhibit infrared ( ir ) divergences , and the familiar cancellation of these with contributions from virtual diagrams has to be generalised to a finite - temperature environment .",
    "it turns out that the cancellation of ir divergences in the non - relativistic regime can be generalised to fully relativistic processes as well  @xcite .",
    "the main topic of this paper is the calculation of higgs yukawa mediated interaction rates in a high temperature background .",
    "we have performed this calculation using methods based on the two - particle - irreducible ( 2pi ) ctp formulation of non - equilibrium quantum field theory , within the framework that has been applied to calculate @xmath13-violating rates in refs .",
    "a main advantage of the 2pi approach is that it directly gives rise to a derivation of the appropriate description of the physical screening that regulates the @xmath6-channel divergences that occur in certain tree - level scattering diagrams .",
    "the screening is implemented by the use of a resummed propagator , which in contrast appears as an ad hoc prescription within an approach based on the calculation of scattering matrix elements .    presently , our main phenomenological interest is to perform a lo calculation of the damping rate of lepton flavour coherence , that is of importance for flavoured leptogenesis .",
    "this flavour damping rate can be used as an input to the systematic analysis of flavour decoherence in leptogenesis , that has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . having obtained the various diagrammatic contributions to flavour damping , it is a simple matter to extract the ( inverse ) decay rates of right - handed neutrinos in the high temperature regime .",
    "we thereby confirm most details of the results presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , but find a substantially larger contribution from @xmath6-channel fermion exchange .",
    "the latter discrepancy should be due to a different technical implementation of the extraction of the coefficients of the logarithmically enhanced ( in squares of the gauge coupling constant ) and the standard perturbative contributions . in order to test our method , we have therefore compared its result to a fit to the numerically performed integral and found it to agree within the expected accuracy of the present approximations .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organised as follows : in section  [ sec : setup ] , we introduce the formalism and explain how the relevant interaction rates are obtained in this setup .",
    "contributions to the interaction rates from self - energy type and vertex type diagrams are calculated in sections  [ sec : self ] and  [ sec : vertex ] respectively , while collinearly enhanced @xmath17 processes are calculated in section  [ sec : onetwo ] .",
    "the final numerical results and implications for phenomenology are presented in section  [ sec : pheno ] , before we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the interactions that lead to the production of right - handed neutrinos @xmath18 are the yukawa couplings @xmath19 .",
    "the lepton asymmetry can be partly transferred from left - handed lepton doublets @xmath20 to right handed active leptons @xmath21 through the yukawa couplings @xmath22 .",
    "these also lead to the decoherence of off - diagonal correlations between the lepton flavours .",
    "explicitly , these yukawa interactions are given by the lagrangian terms @xmath23 where @xmath24 stands for complex conjugation .",
    "four - component spinors are denoted by @xmath25 , and the subscripts indicate the fields that they are associated with .",
    "while a formulation in terms of weyl spinors is also possible and perhaps more appropriate , we choose here four component spinors in order to make use of the standard identities for dirac matrices for the simplification of the spinor algebra .",
    "the indices of @xmath26 are suppressed , the contraction of these between the fields @xmath27 and @xmath28 is implied , and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the antisymmetric rank - two @xmath26 tensor .    the goal of this paper is to calculate interaction rates mediated by yukawa couplings in a finite temperature , finite density environment like the early universe .",
    "tree level @xmath17 processes that are proportional to @xmath31 are kinematically suppressed in the early universe , since all involved particles are massless ( _ i.e. _ masses much smaller than the temperature ) at temperatures @xmath5 above the electroweak phase transition .",
    "similarly , when @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the mass of the right - handed neutrino , the right - handed neutrinos can be approximated as massless , such that decays @xmath34 are suppressed .    with the tree - level @xmath35 channels forbidden or suppressed , the lo rates involve the radiation of one additional gauge boson , which leads to scattering rates that are parametrically of order @xmath36 or @xmath37 , respectively , where @xmath38 denotes a gauge coupling . at the same order ,",
    "there are also contributions from collinearly enhanced @xmath35 processes when medium effects mediated by gauge interactions are resummed into the propagators  @xcite . due to the sizable top - quark yukawa coupling ,",
    "a leading order calculation should also account for the higgs boson decaying into a top - quark pair .",
    "for the present calculation , we assume that all external particles are massless ( before including thermal corrections ) , what leads to significant simplifications ( _ i.e. _ the vanishing of numerous contributions from the ctp feynman rules and the absence of soft and collinear ir divergences ) that become apparent during the course of the calculation . within the ctp formalism",
    ", the production and relaxation rates can be inferred from the collision term , as explained in section  [ sec : collision ] .",
    "the collision terms for @xmath39 , @xmath28 and @xmath40 encompass similar diagrams , that are related among one another by an exchange of the yukawa coupling matrices and the gauge coupling constants . in the following ,",
    "we therefore derive the collision term for @xmath28 , but we factorise the results in such a way that they can easily be employed in order to obtain the production and destruction rates for @xmath40 and @xmath39 as well .      we perform the calculation of the collision terms within the framework developed in refs .  @xcite . here",

    ", we restrict ourselves to flavour - sensitive contributions that are at least of order @xmath31 in the yukawa couplings and that we indicate by a superscript @xmath70 , _ i.e. _ @xmath71 and @xmath72 . due to the non - trivial flavour structure",
    ", these couplings will give rise to flavour decoherence , in contrast to the flavour - diagonal gauge couplings .",
    "the latter interactions are however of importance , as they open up the phase space for flavour - decohering processes ( in combination with the coupling @xmath15 ) that would be kinematically forbidden otherwise .",
    "moreover , gauge interactions maintain kinetic equilibrium for gauged particles , which is what we assume throughout this work .",
    "up to two loops , there are contributions to the flavour - sensitive rates from the one - loop self energy in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] and from the two - loop vertex - type diagrams in figure  [ fig : fl_vertex ] , which are obtained from the self - energy diagram by connecting two different propagators with a gauge boson .",
    "note that in the 2pi approach , no two - particle - reducible diagrams appear where a gauge boson connects to both ends of the same propagator .",
    "similarly , there is no diagrammatic contribution from the insertion of a top - loop into the higgs boson propagator .",
    "while such diagrams with a self - energy insertion do not derive explicitly from the 2pi loop expansion of the effective action , self - energy insertions are of leading importance and are accounted for implicitly , by using resummed propagators to evaluate the collision terms .",
    "in fact , self - energy insertions in all propagators present in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] contribute to the flavour decoherence at lo .",
    "as we will see below , it is possible to expand the higgs propagator up to the order of single loop insertions , whereas the lepton propagators must be maintained in the fully resummed form due to the presence of @xmath6-channel divergences from fermion exchange .",
    "according to the loop expansion indicated in figures  [ fig : diagrams ] and  [ fig : fl_vertex ] , we decompose the collision term as @xmath73 the contribution from the lepton self - energy diagram , figure  [ fig : diagrams ] , is given by @xmath74 _",

    "diagrammatically , the collison term  ( [ c : self ] ) is given by figure  [ fig : cl : self ] , where the double - line propagators represent the resummed propagators .",
    "when all propagators are on shell and massless , @xmath78 , this self energy does not contribute to the collision term , so that no contribution of order @xmath79 arises .",
    "however once the medium effects are included by replacing the tree level propagators with resummed propagators , one obtains contributions that are parametrically of order @xmath80 .",
    "the lo terms of this type will be calculated in section  [ sec : self ] .",
    "the vertex - type diagrams give an order @xmath80 contribution to the collision term when evaluated using tree - level propagators . while in principle , it would be possible to evaluate also these diagrams with finite temperature resummed propagators , the difference between the two calculations is of higher order in the gauge coupling . for the purpose of the present work , it is therefore sufficient to calculate @xmath81 using tree level propagators , which will be performed in section  [ sec : vertex ] . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that collinearly enhanced @xmath16 processes appear as a third contribution that is parametrically as important as the two contributions discussed above , and which requires a resummation of ladder diagrams with an arbitrary number of soft gauge bosons inserted between the higgs and the lepton propagator in figure  [ fig : diagrams ] .",

    "was recently demonstrated in  @xcite . using the approach presented here",
