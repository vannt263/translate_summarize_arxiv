    "despite our limited understanding of what entanglement is at the most fundamental level , many tasks that feature entanglement as a _ sine qua non _ condition have been successfully performed thanks to our ever - growing ability to manipulate quantum systems comprised of interacting subsystems  @xcite .",
    "ultimately , entanglement is an attribute of quantum states and , as such , practical applications will unavoidably rely upon one s ability to prepare certain density matrices . in practice , though , depending on the details of a particular implementation and on the types of noise that affect the relevant quantum system , some entangled states may turn out to be very hard to produce , thus limiting the entanglement available to practical applications . as a result ,",
    "it is natural to ask : how much entanglement is left as we avoid certain density matrices ?    in this paper",
    "this question is approached in the context of two - qubit states and with a clear specification as to which states are to be avoided . surprisingly , we find that no entanglement ( as quantified by three entanglement measures and with respect to a fixed level of mixedness ) is lost as we avoid every two - qubit density matrix , but the sparse family that , in the computational basis , can display non - zero entries only along the main- and anti - diagonals ; the so - called x - states  @xcite . for entanglement measures",
    "we consider concurrence , negativity and relative entropy of entanglement , in terms of which our main result acquires its more precise expression : _ for every two - qubit state with a value of entanglement set by any of these measures , there is a corresponding x - state of same spectrum and same entanglement_.    two - qubit x - states generalize many renowned families of entangled two - qubit states , for example , bell states  @xcite , werner states  @xcite , isotropic states  @xcite and maximally entangled mixed states  @xcite .",
    "they were first identified as a class of states of interest in the work of yu and eberly  @xcite , where some of their properties in connection with the phenomenon of sudden death of entanglement were investigated .",
    "ever since , the interest in x - states exceeded its original motivation and has been manifested in many other contexts  @xcite . particularly relevant for this paper",
    "is the work of hedemann  @xcite , who provided compelling numerical evidence that the set of two - qubit x - states alone is sufficient to access every possible combination of concurrence and purity available to two - qubit states , and conjectured that any generic two - qubit state can be converted into a x - state via a unitary transformation that preserves concurrence . besides proving hedemann s conjecture",
    ", we demonstrate that it also holds true when entanglement is quantified with negativity or relative entropy of entanglement instead of concurrence .",
    "also closely related to our purposes is the work of verstraete  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that , for a fixed set of eigenvalues , the states of maximal concurrence , negativity or relative entropy of entanglement are the same x - states , thus establishing the top frontier of the relevant entanglement versus mixedness diagrams as comprised by x - states .",
    "our main result extends theirs in implying that x - states not only border such diagrams , but can be put in a many - to - one correspondence with every internal point .    from a pragmatic viewpoint",
    ", the interest in this universality property of x - states relies upon their inherent easiness of manipulation , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "owing to the highly sparse form of x - state density matrices written in the computational basis ( x - density matrices , for short ) , a great deal of symbolic computations is possible , even in the context of entanglement quantification where one is usually forced to resort to numerical approaches .",
    "the possibility of replacing generic two - qubit density matrices with x - density matrices is a promising route toward a deeper understanding of mixed - state entanglement . on the experimental side ,",
    "two - qubit x - states can be produced and evolved , for example , with standard interactions arising in the context of nuclear magnetic resonance  @xcite and with variations of available technology for generating werner states in optical and atomic implementations  @xcite .    throughout ,",
    "aiming to take full advantage of the highly sparse form of two - qubit x - density matrices , we exploit the luxury of working in a constructive - analytic fashion .",
    "largely , this is enabled by the introduction of a simple parametrization on the set of x - states , which leads to a geometric visualization of separable , entangled and rank - specific x - states in the relevant parameter space .",
    "thanks to this , we are able to explicitly construct a set of two - qubit x - states that can be put in a one - to - one correspondence with the points of the cp - diagram for generic two - qubit states .",
    "most importantly , we parametrize a unitary transformation that maps an arbitrary two - qubit state into a x - state of same entanglement ( according to any one of the three considered measures ) , and show how to set the parameter values to achieve conservation of concurrence or negativity .",

    "the set of two - qubit x - density matrices is equal to the subset of matrices of the form  ( [ eq : xstates_param ] ) with parameter values that render it positive semidefinite . for that , we start by considering the characteristic equation for ( [ eq : xstates_param ] ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 in the above , the calligraphic letters @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are functions of the diagonal parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",

    "however , the results of  @xcite are not conclusive and call for analytical investigation . also worth of note",
    "is the fact that a closed formula for the genuine multipartite concurrence for arbitrary @xmath276-qubit x - states was recently obtained in  @xcite and maximized in  @xcite , giving rise to the set of @xmath276-qubit x - states of maximal genuine multipartite concurrence for a given linear entropy ( the so - called x - mems ) .",
    "given the formal similarity between the x - state formulas for two - qubit concurrence and @xmath276-qubit genuine multipartite concurrence , it is conceivable that the universality of @xmath276-qubit x - states with respect to genuine multipartite concurrence can be established in an analogous way as that presented in this work .",
    "however , the success of such an analysis depends on a previous demonstration that the x - mems are indeed the maximally entangled mixed states over all @xmath276-qubit states , a fact that is currently unknown  @xcite .",
    "second , the universality of two - qubit x - states with respect to the relative entropy of entanglement implies that a closed formula for the relative entropy of two - qubit x - states can be regarded as a closed - formula for any two - qubit state as long as one is able to relate every two - qubit state with its x - counterpart independently of previous knowledge about the relative entropy of entanglement of the input two - qubit state .",
