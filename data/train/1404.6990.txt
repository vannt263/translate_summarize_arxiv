    "astrophysical and cosmological observations have established that dark matter ( dm ) is one of the main components of our universe .",
    "but the nature of dm is still a mystery .",
    "one kind of well motivated candidates for dm is the so - called weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , which can be produced from the thermal bath in the early universe . in order to explain the correct dm relic density observed today",
    ", wimps should interact with standard model ( sm ) particles via non - negligible couplings .",
    "such interactions are expected to be testable at collider experiments , which are complementary to direct and indirect searches for dm .",
    "dm particles can be produced directly or as decay products of other new particles at colliders .",
    "once produced , dm particles will escape from the detector without energy deposit , like neutrinos .",
    "therefore a large missing energy ( @xmath2 ) is the typical signature of dm particles , which has been used to search for particles in supersymmetric models with r - parity . in order to determine the missing energy , other energetic objects associating with dm particles",
    "are required .",
    "such energetic objects are useful handles and can be jets , leptons , photons , etc . when dm particles are directly produced or their mother particles are almost degenerate with them in mass , a better approach to probe the dm signal is to observe the excess in the @xmath3 processes , where @xmath4 can be a jet  @xcite , a photon  @xcite , a @xmath5 boson  @xcite , a @xmath0 boson  @xcite , or a higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "typically , the interactions between dm and sm particles are model - dependent . in order to capture the most generic features of dm searches at colliders , it is helpful to use the effective field theory approach  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will use contact operators to describe the interactions between dm and sm particles in a rather model - independent way .",
    "studies on dm signatures at hadron colliders have been performed by many authors  @xcite . on the other hand , future high energy @xmath1 colliders , such as ilc , cepc , and tlep ,",
    "can also be good places to probe dm signatures  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 signature at the lhc has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and an experimental analysis at @xmath7 with an integrated luminosity of @xmath8 has been recently released by the atlas collaboration  @xcite . however",
    ", this signature at @xmath1 colliders has not been done . in this work ,",
    "we study the @xmath6 signature at future @xmath1 colliders to fill this gap .",
    "it is worthy to point out that the mono-@xmath0 searching channel is sensitive to the dm interaction with @xmath9 as well as the dm interaction with @xmath10/@xmath11 : 1 ) for the dm-@xmath9 interaction , which is difficult to be explored at hadron colliders , the mono-@xmath0 boson is produced by the initial state radiation of @xmath9 beams .",
    "2 ) for the dm interaction with @xmath10/@xmath11 , a @xmath0 boson and a pair of dm particles are directly produced via the @xmath12 process . in this work ,",
    "we consider two kinds of contact operators to describe these interactions .",
    "it is remarkable that compared with the situation at hadron colliders , the mono-@xmath0 bosons can be reconstructed through both their charged leptonic and hadronic decay channels in a much cleaner environment .",
    "another remarkable fact is that the full 4-momentum of the missing energy can be reconstructed .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eff_op ] , we introduce effective operators to describe the dm interactions with @xmath9 and with electroweak gauge bosons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sim ] , we present the simulation procedure for generating signal and background samples .",
    "we investigate both the charged leptonic and hadronic decay channels of @xmath0 bosons . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sensi ] , we estimate the experimental sensitivity to the interactions . we also compare the expected sensitivity at @xmath1 colliders with the constraints from dm indirect searches . in sec .  [",
    "sec : pol ] , we discuss the benefits of searching with polarized beams , which will be available at the ilc . the final section is our conclusions and discussions .",
    "the mono-@xmath0 channel at @xmath1 colliders is sensitive to the dm production process @xmath13 . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_dmdm_z : a ] , this process can be contributed by @xmath14-channel feynman diagrams due to the dm coupling to @xmath15 . meanwhile",
    ", the dm coupling to @xmath9 can be another source of this process , where the @xmath0 boson comes from the initial state radiation , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : d_dmdm_z : b ] .    in this work",
    ", we assume that the dm particle is a dirac fermion @xmath16 and a singlet under sm gauge interactions .",
    "effective operators are used to describe the interactions between dm and sm particles .",
    "we adopt several representative operators to demonstrate the experimental sensitivity .",
    "comprehensive lists of effective operators for the interactions between dm and electroweak sectors can be found in refs .",
    "regarding the @xmath17 gauge invariance and @xmath18 conservation , a pair of dm particles may couple to a pair of gauge bosons through either of the following dimension-7 operators : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the field strength tensors for the @xmath22 and @xmath23 gauge groups , respectively . in terms of physical fields",
    ", we have @xmath24 with @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the weinberg angle , and @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) is the field strength tensor of the photon ( @xmath0 boson ) . through either @xmath29 or @xmath30",
    ", dm particles generally couple to both @xmath10 and @xmath11 . however ,",
    "if @xmath31 is equal to @xmath32 , @xmath33 would vanish and the coupling to @xmath11 would be turned off .    it is noticed that the dm coupling to @xmath10 may also be originated from another @xmath17 gauge invariant dimension-7 operator  @xcite @xmath34 after the sm higgs doublet @xmath35 acquires its vacuum expectation value , this operator induces a dimension-5 operator @xmath36 at high energy colliders , the dm production resulted from this operator is highly suppressed by a factor of @xmath37 and the sensitivity could be poor . for the sake of comparison with the operators defined in eq .",
    "( [ op1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ op2 ] ) , we take into account this operator in the study .",
    "the interaction between dm and @xmath9 can be described by various effective operators  @xcite .",
    "we consider two dimension-6 operators as illuminating examples : @xmath38 although they have no essential difference in the dimensional analysis , they exhibit distinct behaviors from each other when polarized beams are considered , as we will see below .",
    "here we briefly describe our simulation procedure of generating background and signal samples in the mono-@xmath0 channel at @xmath1 colliders . according to @xmath0 boson decay modes",
    ", we categorize the mono-@xmath0 channel into the charged leptonic channel and the hadronic channel , where the @xmath0 boson decays into two charged leptons and into two jets , respectively .",
    "both background and signal simulation samples are generated by ` madgraph  5 `  @xcite , where the model file is produced by adding the dm particle and its effective couplings to the sm through ` feynrules `  @xcite . `",
    "pythia  6 `  @xcite is used to carry out parton shower , hadronization , and decay processes .",
    "fast detector simulation is performed by ` pgs `  @xcite .",
    "jets are reconstructed by the anti-@xmath39 clustering algorithm  @xcite with the jet parameter @xmath40 . from the technical design report of ilc detectors  @xcite ,",
    "the energy smearing parameters of the electromagnetic calorimeter and of the hadronic calorimeter are implemented to the pgs card , which are listed below as @xmath41 respectively .",
    "we consider three collision energies , @xmath42 , 500  gev and 1  tev , which will be available at the ilc .",
    "future circular higgs factories , like cepc and tlep , may only have a collision energy of @xmath43 or so .",
    "nevertheless , for the dm searching we study here , their sensitivities would be similar to the case of @xmath42 , given the same integrated luminosity .",
    ".for the case of @xmath44 , the benchmark points of effective operators are listed . for the operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath45 is assumed .",
    "@xmath46 is the production cross section of @xmath13 computed by ` madgraph ` . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in tab .",
    "[ tab : pol_xsec ] , we tabulate the cross sections for the main backgrounds and signals under various polarization configurations after applying selection cuts . the polarized cross sections of the main backgrounds are primarily determined by the @xmath9 couplings to @xmath5 and @xmath0 bosons . in the standard model , @xmath47 can only couple to the left - handed @xmath48 and the right - handed @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath0 couples to @xmath9 via @xmath50 , where @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "thus the left - handed @xmath48 ( right - handed @xmath49 ) coupling to @xmath0 is stronger . as a result , for the polarization configurations listed in tab .",
    "[ tab : pol_xsec ] , the backgrounds @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are most suppressed with @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    for the operators @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , the completely polarized cross sections @xmath60 and @xmath61 vanish , due to the requirement of the vector and axial vector current interactions .",
    "@xmath62 is larger than @xmath63 due to the stronger coupling between @xmath0 and left - handed @xmath48 .",
    "however , the backgrounds with @xmath64 are very huge",
    ". the optimal polarization configuration will be @xmath56 .    on the other hand , for the operator @xmath65 , @xmath62 and @xmath63",
    "vanish , because the pseudo - scalar interaction requires the electron and positron have the same helicity . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are equal . in order to avoid huge backgrounds , the optimal polarization configuration will be @xmath66 .    with an integrated luminosity of @xmath67 and @xmath44 , signal significances with unpolarized beams ( @xmath68 ) and with optimal polarized beams ( @xmath69 ) for the benchmark points",
    "are tabulated in tab .",
    "[ tab : pol_signif ] . a gain in significance",
    "is observed and the ratios @xmath70 are in the range of @xmath71 in both the charged leptonic and hadronic channels . since the signal significance is basically proportional to the square root of the integrated luminosity , using optimal polarized beams is roughly equivalent to collecting more than three times of data . in fig .",
    "[ fig:3sigma_lamb_pol ] , we show the @xmath72 reaches in the @xmath73-@xmath74 plane with and without polarized beams for @xmath44 and an integrated luminosity of @xmath75 , where the gains in significance are vividly demonstrated .",
    "in this work , we focus on the dark matter searching sensitivity in the mono-@xmath0 channel at @xmath1 colliders where @xmath0 bosons can be reconstructed by either two charged leptons or two jets . by using the cut - based method ,",
    "we propose two sets of detailed kinematic cuts that can be used in the charged leptonic and hadronic channels , respectively .",
    "it is observed that both the reconstructed @xmath0 boson mass and the recoil mass against the @xmath0 boson are crucial to distinguish signal and background . in the context of effective operators , we obtain the expected sensitivities to the dm couplings to @xmath15 and to @xmath9 . due to the larger branching ratios of the hadronic @xmath0 decay modes and relatively clean background at @xmath1 colliders , with the current analysis we observe that the significance in the hadronic channel is better than that in the charged leptonic channel .",
    "compared with dm indirect searches by the fermi - lat experiment , dm searches at @xmath1 colliders have better sensitivity to the @xmath76 and @xmath77 couplings when the mass of the dm particle is below several hundred gev .",
    "indirect searches for nonrelativistic dm may be incapable of detecting some particular kinds of dm interactions due to @xmath78-wave or helicity suppressed annihilation cross sections . in contrast , collider searches can cover such parameter space and can offer complementary searches to these interactions .",
    "we emphasize that polarized beams can play an impor tant role for the dm searches .",
    "we point out that in order to achieve the optimal sensitivity , different polarization configurations are needed to target different kinds of dm interactions , as demonstrated in tab .",
    "[ tab : pol_xsec ] . we also observed that using optimal polarized beams is roughly equivalent to acquiring more than three times of the integrated luminosity for the case of @xmath44 .",
    "_ note added . _ as this paper was in preparation , a similar paper appeared  @xcite , where the searching for dark matter in the mono-@xmath0 channel at @xmath1 colliders is studied .",
    "nonetheless , it restricts to the study of interactions between dm particles and @xmath9 .",
