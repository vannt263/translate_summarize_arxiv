    "we will see however that the second setup is less informative than the first one . finally , we will consider tunneling between a 5/2 edge and a uniform parallel one - channel quantum wire .",
    "such setup can come in two versions : a ) tunneling into a full 5/2 edge that includes both fractional and integer modes and b ) tunneling into a fractional edge between @xmath8 and @xmath0 qhe liquids @xcite .",
    "a closely related setup is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ setup-2 ] . there",
    "the tunneling occurs between different modes of the same edge .    below we will use the language referring to tunneling between two qhe liquids , a 5/2 liquid and an integer @xmath8 qhe liquid .",
    "this language can be easily translated to the quantum wire situation .",
    "in contrast to the integer qhe edge , a quantum wire contains counter - propagating modes .",
    "however , the energy and momentum conservation , together with the pauli principle , generally restrict tunneling to only one of those modes .",
    "the hamiltonian assumes the following general structure : @xmath38 where the three contributions denote the hamiltonians of the @xmath12 edge , the integer edge and the tunneling term .",
    "the latter term expresses as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the coordinate on the edge , @xmath41 is the electron creation operator at the integer edge , @xmath42 are electron operators at the fractional qhe edge and @xmath43 are tunneling amplitudes .",
    "several operators @xmath42 correspond to different edge modes .",
    "we assume that the system is uniform .",

    "( [ restriction ] ) we first note that in a uniform system @xmath46 can not depend on the coordinate .",
    "next , we consider the system with the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath47 the current can depend on @xmath48 only and not on @xmath49 - otherwise different points of the junction would not be equivalent . applying the second order perturbation theory in @xmath50 to the calculation of",
    "the current one finds that @xmath51 must be a constant , independent of @xmath49 . using the limit of small",
    "@xmath48 one now easily sees that the phase of the complex number @xmath52 is a linear function of @xmath40 .",
    "this proves eq .",
    "( [ restriction ] ) .",
    "we assume that the same voltage @xmath11 is applied to both contacts at the upper @xmath0 edge in fig .  1 , so that all right - moving and left - moving modes at the upper edge are in equilibrium with the chemical potential @xmath53 .",
    "the lower edge is grounded , i.e. , the chemical potential at the lower edge @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath45 may depend on the applied voltage @xmath11 since the width of the line junction may change when the applied voltage changes .",
    "we will neglect that dependence in the case of the setup with the tunneling between two qhe liquids ; more specifically , we will assume that both liquids are kept at a constant charge density and the tunneling between them is weak . in the case of the tunneling between a qhe liquid and a quantum wire we will assume that the charge density is kept constant in 2deg but can be controlled by the gate voltage in the one - dimensional wire .",
    "the fermi - momentum @xmath55 in the quantum wire depends on the charge density and any change of @xmath55 results in an equal change of all @xmath45 .",
    "thus , we will assume a setup with two 2deg in the discussion of the voltage dependence of the tunneling current at fixed @xmath45 .",
    "the setup with a quantum wire will be assumed in the discussion of the dependence of the current on @xmath55 at a fixed low voltage . in all cases",
    "we will assume that the temperature is low .    in our calculations",
    "we will use the luttinger liquid model for the edge states @xcite .",
    "it assumes a linear spectrum for each mode and neglects tunneling between different modes on the same edge .",
    "these assumptions are justified in the regime of low energy and momentum .",
    "thus , we expect that the results for the tunneling between two 2deg are only qualitatively valid at high voltage .",
    "our main assumption is that both energy and momentum conserve in each tunneling event .",
    "this means that we neglect disorder at the edges .",
    "this assumption needs a clarification in the case of the disorder - dominated anti - pfaffian state because its formation requires edge disorder .",
    "we will assume that for that state only neutral modes couple to disorder and one can neglect disorder effects on the charged mode .",
    "for completeness , we include a discussion of the momentum resolved tunneling into the non - equilibrated anti - pfaffian state . however , a much simpler experiment is sufficient to detect that state .",
    "one just needs to measure the conductance of the @xmath12-liquid in the bar geometry illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup2 ] .",
    "indeed , in the non - equilibrated anti - pfaffian state , disorder is irrelevant .",
    "each non - equilibrated edge has three charged fermi - liquid modes propagating in one direction and another luttinger - liquid charged mode ( and a neutral mode ) propagating in the opposite direction . in the bar geometry , the lower edge carries the current @xmath56 .",
    "the upper charged mode carries the current @xmath57 _ in the same direction_. hence , the total current is @xmath58 and the conductance is @xmath59 and not @xmath12 conductance quanta .",
    "our discussion assumes an ideal situation with no disorder . in a large system",
    "even weak disorder , irrelevant in the renormalization group sense , might result in edge equilibration .",
    "nevertheless , if the qhe bar is shorter than the equilibration length the nature of the state can be probed by the conductance measurement in the bar geometry .    before presenting the calculations we will discuss a qualitative picture . unless otherwise specified we consider @xmath60 .",
    "as seen from the calculations in the following section , the particle - hole symmetry for luttinger liquids implies that the tunneling current at negative @xmath45 can be found from the relation @xmath61 .",
    "we assume that tunneling is weak and hence only single electron tunneling matters .",
    "one can imagine two types of electron operators on the edge : one type of operators simply creates an electron in one of the integer or fractional channels .",
    "the second type of operators creates and destroys electrons in different edge channels of the same edge .",
    "generally , operators of the second type are less relevant than operators of the first type and we will neglect them ( see , however , a discussion in the appendix for the case of reconstructed integer edge channels ) .",
    "an exception is the @xmath1 state .",
    "only electrons pairs can tunnel into the fractional @xmath1 edge . as we will see in section vi",
    ", the most relevant single - electron operator transfers two electron charges into the fractional edge and removes one electron charge from a co - propagating integer edge . for simplicity of our qualitative discussion , in this section we will disregard that operator and concentrate instead on the two - electron tunneling operator into the fractional edge .",
    "such operator is most relevant in the setup fig [ setup-2 ] .",
    "we will use another simplifying assumption in this section : we will neglect interaction between different integer and fractional modes .",
    "this assumption is not crucial as discussed in section v and we make it solely for simplicity .",
    "we will find the total number of singularities both for strongly and weakly interacting edges . at the same time",
    ", the current can be found analytically in the case of weak interactions , sec .",
    ".    at the lower edge there are two edge modes for spin - up and -down electrons . at the upper edge",
    "there are two spin - up and -down integer modes and one or more modes corresponding to the @xmath62 edge .",
    "spin is conserved during the tunneling process .",
    "thus , we have three contributions to the tunneling current : ( a ) tunneling between the upper spin - down fractional edge modes and the lower spin - down integer edge mode ; ( b ) tunneling between the upper spin - down integer edge mode and the lower spin - down integer edge mode ; ( c ) tunneling between the upper spin - up integer edge mode and the lower spin - up integer edge mode .",
    "we use only the lowest order perturbation approximation so these contributions are independent .",
    "thus , the total tunneling current is @xmath63 .",
    "contributions ( b ) and ( c ) are similar since the zeeman energy is small compared to the coulomb interaction under typical magnetic fields .",
    "thus , we will only consider spin - down electrons below .",
    "all edge modes are chiral luttinger liquids with the spectra of the form @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the edge mode velocity , the sign reflects the propagation direction",
    ". we will first consider case ( b ) ( case ( c ) is identical ) , tunneling between two integer fermi - liquid edge modes .",
    "denote the upper edge velocity as @xmath66 and the lower edge velocity as @xmath67 .",
    "if an electron of momentum @xmath68 from the upper edge tunnels into the lower edge or vice verse , energy and momentum conservation gives @xmath69 where @xmath70 ( in the rest of this paper , we will refer to both @xmath71 and @xmath11 as the applied voltage ) .",
    "the tunneling happens only when @xmath72 , i.e. , one of the two states is occupied and the other is not .",
    "( [ eqn : conservation ] ) is easy to solve directly but a graphical approach is more transparent . fig .  [",

    "( [ eqn : conservation ] ) .",
    "the black dots represent occupied states .",
    "we see that when @xmath73 , both states at the intersection point are unoccupied , therefore no tunneling happens .",
    "when @xmath71 increases , the left line moves down . for a small @xmath71 , there is still no tunneling .",
    "after @xmath71 reaches the value of @xmath74 and the state from the right line at the intersection point becomes occupied , an electron from the lower edge can tunnel into the upper edge .",
    "this results in a positive contribution to the tunneling current .",
    "since the tunneling happens only at the intersection point and the tunneling density of states ( tdos ) is a constant in fermi liquids , the current will remain constant for @xmath75 . for a negative @xmath71 ,",
    "the situation is similar .",
    "before @xmath71 reaches the value @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath77 , no tunneling happens .",
    "when @xmath78 , an electron from the upper edge can tunnel into the lower edge and a negative voltage - independent tunneling current results .",

    "the positions of the two jumps provide the information about the edge mode velocities .",

    "this does not create much difference for the further analysis .",
    "it is convenient to use bosonization language for the description of the @xmath1 edge .",
    "all elementary excitations are bosons with positive momenta @xmath84 and linear spectrum .",
    "thus , the relation between the momentum and energy remains the same as in the fermi liquid case .",
    "hence , the @xmath85 curve has singularities at @xmath80 and @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the velocity at the @xmath1 fractional edge .",
    "however , the current is no longer a constant above the thresholds because of a different tdos .",
    "we will see below that the current exhibits universal power - law dependence on the voltage bias near the thresholds .",
    "in the pfaffian state , case ( a ) involves three modes : a charged boson mode @xmath88 and a neutral majorana fermion mode @xmath89 from the upper edge , and the fermi - liquid mode from the lower edge .",

    "any tunneling event involves creation of a majorana fermion .",

    "this may happen at a positive applied voltage .",
    "in this process the electron emits a majorana fermion and creates excitations of the charged boson mode at the upper edge .",

    "different @xmath89-lines start at different _ occupied _ states on the right line and correspond to different momenta of the electron at the lower edge .",
    "one can visualize the tunneling process in the following way : an electron with the momentum @xmath93 from the right line slides along the @xmath89-line ( emitting a majorana fermion with the momentum @xmath94 ) and reaches the left line at @xmath95 ( otherwise the tunneling is not possible since the momentum change @xmath96 of the bose mode must be positive ) .",
    "both energy and momentum are conserved in such picture . because the majorana fermion has a positive momentum",
    "the @xmath89-line points downward and leftward .",

    "the highest @xmath89-line intersects the left line at @xmath99 , so the tunneling becomes possible and contributes a positive current . thus @xmath100 is the positive threshold voltage . when @xmath71 reaches @xmath101 , the intersection point of the right and left lines corresponds to @xmath95 ( an ` empty state ' ) at the upper edge and a filled state at the lower edge .",
    "the tunneling process involving those two states and a zero - momentum majorana fermion becomes possible .",
    "this results in another singularity in the @xmath85 curve . for negative @xmath71",
    ", it is expected that a majorana fermion and an excitation of the charged boson mode combine into an electron and tunnel into the lower edge .",
    "the same analysis as above shows that there is no current when @xmath71 is negative and small .",
    "when @xmath80 , the tunneling process involving a zero - momentum majorana fermion becomes possible .",

    ".    for all other proposed fractional states , the graphical method also works but becomes more complicated , so we will not discuss them in detail here .",
    "the above discussion , based only on the conservation of energy and momentum , confirms that singularities appear in the @xmath85 characteristics and they are closely related to the number and nature of the edge modes . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the calculations based on the chiral luttinger liquid theory .",
    "the calculations below involve the velocities of the charged and neutral edge modes .",
    "we generally expect charged modes to be faster .",
    "indeed , in the chiral luttinger liquid theory the kinetic energy and the coulomb interaction enter in the same form , quadratic in the bose - fields . since the coulomb contribution exists only for the charged mode , it is expected to have a greater velocity .",
    "we now calculate the tunneling current . in this section",
    "we derive a general expression , valid for all models . in the next two sections",
    "it will be applied to the six models discussed above .    as mentioned above , to the lowest order of the perturbation theory",
    "the tunneling current can be separated into three independent parts , @xmath102 .",

    "so in the following , we will only consider @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "we will use below the bosonization language which can be conveniently applied to all modes except majorana fermions .",
    "thus , we will not explicitly discuss majorana modes in this section .",
    "however , all results can be extended to the situation involving majorana fermions without any difficulty .",
