    "the symmetry principle is perhaps the most important ingredient in the development of high energy physics . roughly speaking , the symmetries of the physical system lead to conservation laws , which give many important relations among physical processes .",
    "many of the symmetries in nature are however approximate symmetries rather than exact symmetries and are also very useful in the understanding of various phenomena in high energy physics . among the broken approximate symmetries ,",
    "the most interesting one is the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) which seems to have played a special role in high energy physics .",
    "many important progress has come from the understanding of the ssb .",
    "the ssb is characterized by the fact that symmetry breaking shows up in the ground state rather than in the basic interaction .",
    "this makes it difficult to uncover this kind of approximate symmetries .",
    "historically , ssb was first discovered around 1960 in the study of superconductivity in the solid state physics by nambu and goldstone @xcite .",
    "one of consequences of ssb is the presence of the massless excitation @xcite , called the nambu - goldstone boson , or just goldstone boson for short .",
    "later , nambu @xcite applied the idea to the particle physics . in combination with @xmath1 current algebra",
    ", ssb has been quite successful in the understanding of the chiral symmetry in the low energy phenomenology of strong interaction .",
    "more importantly , in 1964 it was discovered by higgs @xcite and others @xcite that in the context of gauge theory , ssb has the remarkable property that it can convert the long range force in the gauge theory into a short range force .",
    "thus it avoids both the massless goldstone bosons and the massless gauge bosons .",
    "weinberg , @xcite and salam @xcite , then applied this ideas to construct a model of electromagnetic and weak interactions .",
    "the significance of this model was not realized until thooft @xcite show in 1971 that it was renomalizable . since then",
    "this model has enjoyed remarkable experimental success and now called the `` standard model of electroweak interactions '' @xcite .",
    "undoubtedly , this will serve as benchmark for any new physics for years to come .",
    "in this article i will give a simple introduction to the spontaneous symmetry breaking and its application to chiral symmetries in the hadronic interaction .",
    "the emphasis is on the qualitative understanding rather than completeness and mathematical rigor .",
    "eventhough ssb has been quite successful in explaining many interesting phenomena , its implementation in the theoretical framework is more or less put in by hand and it is not at all clear what is the origin of ssb . here",
    "i will also discuss some non - relativistic example where the physics is more tractable in the hope that they might give some hints about the true nature of ssb .",
    "maybe good understanding of ssb might extend its applicability to some new frontier .",
    "the @xmath0-model has a long and interesting history .",
    "it was originally constructed in 1960 s as a tool to study the chiral symmetry in the system with pions and nucleons@xcite .",
    "later the spontaneous symmetry breaking and pcac ( partially conserved axial current ) were incorporated ..",
    "eventhough this model is not quite phenomenologically correct it remains the simplest example which realizes many important aspects of broken symmetries .",
    "even though the strong interaction is now described by @xmath3 the @xmath0-model of pions and nucleons is still useful as an effective interaction in the low energies where it is difficult to calculate directly from @xmath4 in addition , the @xmath0-model has also been used quite often as a framework to test many interesting ideas in field theory and string theory . here",
    "we will discuss the most basic features of the @xmath0-model .",

    "it is more useful to write this lagrangian as : @xmath9 ^{2 }   \\label{sigma2 } \\\\ & & + \\overline{n}_{l}i\\gamma ^{\\mu } \\partial _ { \\mu } n_{l}+\\overline{n}% _ { r}i\\gamma ^{\\mu } \\partial _ { \\mu } n_{r}+g(\\overline{n}_{l}\\sigma n_{r}+% \\overline{n}_{r}\\sigma ^{\\dagger } n_{l } )   \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 this lagrangian is now clearly invariant under transformation , @xmath11 where @xmath12 are two arbitrary @xmath13unitary matrices .",
    "thus the symmetry group is @xmath14 and representation contents under this group are @xmath15 : the nucleon mass term @xmath16transforms as @xmath17 representation and is not invariant .",
    "one way to construct invariant nucleon mass term is to introduce another doublet of fermions with opposite parity , @xmath18",
    "so that the term @xmath19is invariant . this will give same mass to both doublets and is usually called parity doubling . as we shall see later , another way to give mass to nucleon is by spontaneous symmetry breaking which does not require another doublet .",
    "the general form of noether current is of the form @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the infinitesimal change of the fields under the symmetry transformations .",
    "we have for the left - handed transformation , @xmath22 and @xmath23 + % \\overline{n}_{l}\\gamma _ { \\mu } \\frac{\\tau ^{a}}{2}n_{l}\\ ] ] similarly , @xmath24 and @xmath25 + % \\overline{n}_{r}\\gamma _ { \\mu } \\frac{\\tau ^{a}}{2}n_{r}\\ ] ] the corresponding charges are given by @xmath26 using the canonical commutation relations , we can derive @xmath27 = i\\varepsilon _ { ijk}q_{l}^{c},\\qquad \\left [ q_{r}^{a},q_{r}^{b}\\right ] = i\\varepsilon _ { ijk}q_{r}^{c},\\qquad \\left [ q_{l}^{a},q_{l}^{b}\\right ] = 0\\ ] ] which is the @xmath28 algebra .",
    "the vector and axial charges are given by @xmath29 in particular , the axial charges are @xmath30   \\label{axialcurr}\\ ] ] : another way to describe the symmetry of the @xmath0-model is the @xmath31 symmetry , which is isomorphic to @xmath32 locally and is characterized by @xmath33 orthogonal matrix , @xmath34 the infinitesimal transformation is @xmath35 the scalar field @xmath36 transform as 4-dimensional vector , @xmath37 the combination @xmath38is just the length of the vector @xmath39 and is clearly invariant under the rotations in 4-dimension .",
    "if we take @xmath40 we get @xmath41 thus we see from eqs([lefttran],[righttran ] ) that the parameters @xmath42 correspond to vector transformations and @xmath43 the axial transformation",
    ".      the classical ground state is determined by minimum of the self interaction of scalars , @xmath44 the minimum of the potential is located at @xmath45 which is a 3-sphere , @xmath46 in the 4-dimensional space formed by the scalar fields .",
    "each point on @xmath46 is invariant under @xmath47 rotations .",
    "for example , the point @xmath48 is invariant under the rotations of the first 3 components of the vector .",
    "then , after a point on @xmath46 is chosen to be the classical ground state , the symmetry is broken spontaneously from @xmath31 to @xmath49 note that different points on @xmath46 are related to each other by the action of those rotations which are in @xmath31 but not in @xmath50 these rotations are usually denoted by @xmath51(this is called the coset space . ) . thus we can identify 3-sphere with @xmath52    for the quantum theory , we need to expand the fields around the classical values @xmath53 here @xmath54 is usually called the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "then we see that @xmath55 @xmath56 thus @xmath57 are massless and @xmath8 s are massive.remark:if we had made another choice for vev , e.g . @xmath58",
    "the physics is still the same as we will now illustrate . in this case , we write @xmath59 to get @xmath60 @xmath61 thus we still have 3 massless scalar fields . for the nucleon , if we define @xmath62 we get @xmath63 which the mass term for the new field .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath64 @xmath65form an unbroken @xmath66 algebra .",
    "there are several interesting features worth noting :    @xmath67 s are massless .",
    "this is a consequence of the goldstone theorem which states that spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb)of a continuous symmetry will give massless particle or zero energy excitation .",
    "this theorem will be discussed in more detail in next subsection .",
    "@xmath68after ssb , the original multiplet @xmath69splits into massless @xmath70 and massive @xmath71 also the nucleons become massive .",
    "thus eventhough the interaction is @xmath72 symmetric the spectrum is only @xmath73 symmetric .",
    "this is the typical consequence of ssb . in some sense ,",
    "the original symmetry is realized by combining the @xmath66 multiplet , e.g. @xmath8 , with the massless goldstone bosons to form the multiplets of @xmath74 this , as we will discuss later , is the basis of the low energy theorem .",
    "@xmath75the axial current in eq([axialcurr ] ) after the ssb will have a term linear in @xmath76 field , @xmath77 which is responsible for the matrix element , @xmath78 using this matrix element in @xmath76 decay , we can identify the vev @xmath54 with the pion decay constant @xmath79 this coupling between axial current @xmath80 and @xmath81 will give rise to a massless pole .    @xmath82the appearance of the cubic term @xmath83 and the mass term @xmath84 is the result of the spontaneous symmetry breaking . since these terms have dimension 3 , they are usually called soft breaking , in contrast to the dimension 4 hard breaking terms .",
    "@xmath85 in the scalar self interaction , quartic , cubic , and quadratic terms have only 2 parameters , @xmath86 this means that these 3 terms are not independent , and there is a relation among them .",
    "this is an example of low energy theorem for theory with spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the ssb leads to many relations which are quite different from the usual symmetry breaking .",
    "the most distinct ones are relations among amplitudes involving goldstone bosons in low energies .",
    "as we have mentioned before , these relations are consequence of the fact that goldstone bosons are massless and can be tagged on to other particles to form a larger multiplet . since goldstone bosons do carry energies ,",
    "this is possible only in limit that goldstone bosons have zero energies .",
    "consider the following processes involving the goldstone bosons in the external states .",
    "@xmath87the tree - level contributions are coming from diagrams in fig1 ,    the amplitudes for these diagrams are given by , @xmath88 @xmath89\\ ] ] here @xmath90 @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the usual mandelstam variables , @xmath93 . in the limit where pions have zero momenta , @xmath94 we get @xmath95 @xmath96 and @xmath97 = 0\\ ] ] where we have used @xmath98 thus the amplitude vanishes in the soft pion limit , i.e. @xmath99    @xmath100 similar calculation gives    @xmath101\\ ] ] in the soft pion limit , @xmath102 we get @xmath103 this is the same as the limit , @xmath104 because soft pion means pion momentum much smaller than @xmath105 these are simple examples of the low energy theorem which says that physical amplitudes vanish in the limit where myomata of goldstone bosons go to zero .    in examples above , the vanishing of these amplitudes results from some cancellation among different contributions . since this is a general property of the goldstone boson , there should be a better way of getting this .",
    "it turns that one can change the variables representing the scalar fields such that goldstone bosons always enter with derivative coupling .",
    "then the vanishing of the amplitudes involving goldstone boson is manifest .",
    "this can be accomplished by the which we will now describe briefly(@xcite ) .",
    "suppose we start from a lagrangian with field @xmath106 and make a transformation to a new field @xmath107 with the relation , @xmath108 where @xmath109is some power series in @xmath110if we impose the condition that @xmath111 the free lagrangian for @xmath112 will be the same as that for @xmath113 then according to a general theorem valid with rather weak restrictions on the lagrangian and @xmath114 the on - shell matrix elements calculated with @xmath112 fields and with @xmath106 fields are the same .",
    "we will use this field redefinition to write the goldstone boson interaction in terms of derivative coupling . consider a simplified lagrangian given by    @xmath115 + \\frac{\\mu ^{2}}{2}% \\left ( \\sigma ^{2}+\\pi ^{2}\\right ) -\\frac{\\lambda } { 4}\\left ( \\sigma ^{2}+\\pi ^{2}\\right ) ^{2}\\ ] ]    which is just the @xmath116 version of the @xmath0-model without the nucleon . as before",
    ", the ssb will require the shift of the @xmath0-field , as in eq([vev ] ) and @xmath76 field is massless ( goldstone boson ) .",
    "equivalently , we can use a complex field defined by @xmath117 so that the lagrangian is of the form @xmath118 the symmetry transformation is then @xmath119 @xmath120 is some constant .now we use the polar coordinates for the complex field @xmath121 to write the lagrangian in the form , @xmath122",
    "this clearly shows that @xmath123 is massless and has only derivative couplings .",
    "this follows from the fact that the @xmath124 ( or @xmath125 ) symmetry @xmath126 corresponds to @xmath127 which is inhomogeneous .",
    "so @xmath123 needs to have a derivative in order to be invariant under such inhomogeneous transformation .",
    "note that this lagrangian , due to the presence of terms like @xmath128 is not renormalizable .",
    "but this lagrangian will be used only as an effective theory to study the low energy phenomenology while the renomalizability deals with high energy behavior .      from eq([ssbv ] ) we see that the pions @xmath129 are massless .",
    "this is a consequence of the goldstone theorem which states that spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry will give a massless particle or zero energy excitation .",
    "we will first illustrate this by showing that quadratic terms in @xmath129 are absent in the tree level as a consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking of the original chiral symmetry .. we will use the @xmath31 notation , @xmath130the invariance under the chiral transformation implies that @xmath131 differentiating eq([invv ] ) with respect to @xmath132 and then evaluating this at the minimum , we see that @xmath133 for the case @xmath134 we see that in the expansion of @xmath135 around the minimum , @xmath136 there are no terms of the form , @xmath137 with @xmath138 therefore @xmath139 are massless in the tree level .",
    "we can extend this to more general case where the effective potential is written as @xmath140 this potential is invariant under some symmetry group @xmath141 which transforms @xmath39 as @xmath142 where @xmath143 are the parameters for the infinitesimal transformations and @xmath144 matrix for the representation where @xmath39 belongs .",
    "the invariance under these transformation implies that @xmath145 the minimum of the potential is located at @xmath146 which satisfies the equation , @xmath147 differentiating eq ( [ minimum ] ) with respect to @xmath132 and evaluating this at the minimum , @xmath146 we get @xmath148 this means that the vector @xmath149 if non - zero , is an eigenvector of the mass matrix @xmath150 with zero eigenvalue(massless ) .",
    "thus the number of massless goldstone bosons is just the number of independent vectors of the form , @xmath151 in other words , if @xmath152 the combination @xmath153 is the goldstone boson , up to a normalization constant .",
    "these arguments only show that @xmath129 s are massless in the tree level .",

    "the energy and momentum is related by @xmath168then eq ( [ massless ] ) implies the existence of massless particle in the system .",
    "more specifically , there are physical states @xmath169 with the property that @xmath170 and are massless from goldstone theorem .",
    "it is convenient to choose the normalization such that @xmath171 and write @xmath172 it is easy to see that @xmath173 for the non - relativistic system eq([massless ] ) simply says that the dispersion relation @xmath174has zero energy excitation .      in the @xmath0-model without the nucleons",
    ", we have 3 massless @xmath76 s and a massive @xmath0 field . for the energies much smaller than @xmath175 the massless goldstone bosons are the important physical degrees of freedoms and it is desirable to write down an effective theory with @xmath76 s only . as we have seen , the theory with ssb has many physical consequences , e.g. low energy theorem for the goldstone bosons .",
    "the removal of @xmath0-field should preserve symmetry so that these results are maintained . also , phenomenologically there are no good evidence for the existence of the @xmath176 meson which is the partner of @xmath57 in the chiral symmetry .",
    "we now discuss the explicit steps for carrying out this process .",
    "write the scalar fields as a vector in 4-dimensional space , @xmath177 we want to parametrize the @xmath106 fields in such a way that the non - goldstone field to be eliminated later is @xmath31 invariant .",

    ", this describes the same physics as the usual @xmath0-model lagrangian in the goldstone sector .",
    "for example , we can check that in the simple case of @xmath197 scattering in the tree level the amplitude from this lagrangian in eq ( [ nonlinl ] ) is @xmath198 = \\frac{i}{v^{2}}\\left ( s+t+u\\right ) .\\ ] ] this is the same result as in eq([pipi ] ) , obtained in the @xmath0-model with @xmath199    the lagrangian in eq ( [ nonlinl ] ) which contains on the goldstone boson fields , is one example of non - linear realization of chiral symmetry , which will be discussed in detail in the next section . here",

    "these transformations on @xmath287 and @xmath288 induced by the group elements will have the same group properties as the group elements and are called the _ non - linear realization _ of the group .",
    "this is in contrast to the usual representation of the group where group elements are represented by matrices . in the transformation in eq([coset ] ) @xmath289 is generally not a linear function of @xmath290 but for the special case where @xmath291 is a group element from the unbroken subgroup @xmath240 we get , from eq([g ] ) , @xmath292 where @xmath293 in general , the broken generators @xmath294 transform as some representation @xmath295 with respect to the subgroup @xmath240@xmath296 for example , in the case of @xmath297 model , the broken generators , @xmath298 transform as triplet under the unbroken subgroup @xmath299 we can then write @xmath300 where @xmath301 this means that @xmath302 transform linearly under the subgroup @xmath303 also it is easy to see that the parameters @xmath304 are independent of the coset parameters @xmath305 .",

    "there is significant simplification due to parity operation .",
    "we will illustrate this in the simple case of @xmath308 symmetry .",

    "however , the combination @xmath320 will have a simple transformation law , @xmath321 since @xmath322 are independent of the coset parameters @xmath283this transformation law is linear and will be useful for constructing lagrangian .",
    "we are interested in the cases where spontaneous symmetry breaking is generated by the scalar fields .",
    "some of these scalar fields become the massless goldstone bosons , like the pions in the @xmath0-model and others remain massive , like @xmath0-field .",

    "since the transformation law for @xmath351 is linear and simple , it is easier to construct the chirally invariant interaction in terms of @xmath352 rather than @xmath353 it is easy to see that the only invariants without derivatives will involve trace of some powers of @xmath354which is just an identity matrix .",

[ [ nucleon - field ] ] nucleon field + + + + + + + + + + + + +    the nucleon field in the linear @xmath0-model has the transformation properties , @xmath376 thus to couple nucleon fields to the goldstone bosons , we could write down the following @xmath5 invariant coupling , @xmath377 however , this is not of the form of derivative coupling which exhibits the low energy theorem explicitly . for this purpose and general non - linear realization , we define a new nucleon field by , @xmath378 under the action of the group element @xmath360we get @xmath379 where @xmath380 thus @xmath381 transforms according to the representation of the subgroup @xmath236 but with the group parameters depend on @xmath76 fields , @xmath382 then from the transformation properties given in eqs([covarv , covara ] ) , we can write down the derivative coupling as @xmath383 which will yield the low energy theorem explicitly .",
    "in the frame work of relativistic field theory , e.g. in @xmath218 @xmath0-model , spontaneous symmetry breaking seems to be put in by hand , i.e. setting the quadratic terms to have negative sign in the scalar potential in order to develope vacuum expectation value .",

    "for calculational simplicity we allow every spin to interact with every other spin , while more realistic situation will be the short range nearest neighbor interaction .",
    "but the interest here is to see how the spontaneous symmetry breaking come about and we will ignore this .",

    "this condition , we have @xmath416 here @xmath417 is the coupling which wants to align the spins in the same direction while the effect of temperature is to randomize spins .",
    "thus the condition in eq([critical ] ) simply means that the interaction of spins has to overcome the thermalization in order to produce significant spin alignment .",
    "the temperature @xmath418 is usually called the critical temperature and spontaneous symmetry breaking is possible only for @xmath419 in this simple example , the non - zero magnetization @xmath420 breaks the symmetry , @xmath421 and originates from the competition between spin - spin interaction which aligns the spin and the thermalization which tends to destroy the alignment.remarks:@xmath422from the partition function in eq([partition ] ) we see that the probability to find the system to have @xmath423 is given by the boltzmann factor @xmath424 if @xmath404 is the absolute minimum for @xmath400 , then in the thermodynamic limit @xmath425 we have @xmath426 and the probability for all the other @xmath423 will be zero . @xmath68for the case @xmath427 is near @xmath428the minimum of @xmath408 is located at small values of @xmath255 .",
    "thus we can expand @xmath408 in power series , @xmath429 the minimum is then @xmath430 this means that near the critical temperature @xmath431the dependence of average magnetization on @xmath432 is non - analytic .",
    "this is a typical behavior of physical quantities near the critical point .",
    "the superfluid @xmath433 provides a simple example of goldstone excitation where the excitation energy , @xmath434 goes to zero when the wave number @xmath435 the helium atoms are tightly bounded and the long - distance attractive force between atoms are very weak while the short distance is strongly repulsive .",
    "thus a system of helium atoms can be described as a gas of weakly interacting bosons with hamiltonian , @xmath436 here @xmath437 is the potential describes the effective interaction between helium atoms and @xmath438 is the field operator for the helium atom and satisfies the commutation relation , @xmath439 = \\delta ^{3}\\left ( x - y\\right)\\ ] ] we will assume that the system is in a large box of volume @xmath440 with periodical boundary condition . clearly , this hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation , @xmath441 this is just a @xmath124 symmetry which says that the number of he atoms is conserved .",
