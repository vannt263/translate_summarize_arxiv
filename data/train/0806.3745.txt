    "the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is expected soon to begin circulation of beams , with proton - proton collisions at center - of - mass energy @xmath10 tev , followed by a physics run at @xmath11 tev .",
    "this energy scale ought to be sufficient to explore the mechanism behind the breakdown of electroweak symmetry ( ewsb)@xcite .",
    "expectations are high that the upcoming lhc era will provide the necessary data to construct a new paradigm for the laws of physics as we know them , and new physics beyond that of the standard model ( sm ) is widely anticipated .",
    "numerous theoretical constructs have been created , including weak scale supersymmetry@xcite , theories with extra dimensions@xcite , little higgs models@xcite , _",
    "which- if any- of these theories correctly describes nature at the tev scale will be determined by lhc experiments  @xcite .",
    "however , before new physics searches can commence at the lhc , it will be necessary to fully understand the responses of the atlas and cms detectors to particle physics scattering events . towards this end",
    ", the experimental groups will first focus their interest on well - understood sm processes .",
    "these will include the following :    * detect familiar di - jet or multi - jet events and compare the measured jet @xmath12 , @xmath13(=pseudorapidity ) and invariant mass distributions to expectations from qcd theory and monte carlo event generators .",
    "* detect the @xmath14 events ( @xmath15 or @xmath16 initially ) and verifying that the @xmath1-peak appears with the correct mass and width as measured by lep / tevatron experiments .",
    "one also wants to study the associated multi - jet activity and use the rates as a tune for monte carlo generators .",
    "in particular , @xmath17jets production should serve as an excellent calibrator for @xmath18jets production , which is one of the most important backgrounds for susy jets @xmath19 searches . *",
    "detect @xmath20 events , verify the expected transverse mass distribution and investigate again the associated multiplicity of jets expected .",
    "* detect @xmath21 production and check that the lhc - measured @xmath22 value is in accord with the most recent tevatron results .",
    "the simplest channel to begin with is @xmath23 while the other @xmath24 decays hadronically , thus allowing a direct @xmath22 reconstruction with relatively few ambiguities .    once these familiar processes are measured , and it is ascertained that expected results are in accord with previous lep / tevatron measurements and sm theory , then the hunt for _ deviations _ from the sm can be made and the search for new physics will have begun .",
    "in addition , if a high degree of confidence is gained in the observation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production , then these reactions may serve as a _",
    "luminosity monitor_.    the rate for @xmath25 boson production at the lhc is @xmath26 nb , while @xmath1 production occurs at the @xmath27 nb rate .",
    "the @xmath28 cross section for @xmath29 gev is @xmath30 pb . thus , with only @xmath31 fb@xmath32 of integrated luminosity , sizable @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 signals are expected .    in this paper , we wish to make the point that it is possible that _ new physics _",
    "signals at the lhc may be so large that they may already make their presence felt in these baseline sm reactions . in this case",
    ", they would potentially disrupt efforts at calibrating both detectors and monte carlo event generators to expected sm signal levels .",
    "as an example , we consider a relatively low mass spectrum of supersymmetric particles .",
    "weak scale supersymmetry is one the main classes of new physics signals to be searched for at the lhc .",
    "we adopt several simple susy case studies and show that these may cause distortions in the @xmath3jets , @xmath4jets and @xmath2 signal channels .    in our simulations",
    "we adopt the event generator isajet 7.76@xcite to model @xmath3jets , @xmath4jets , @xmath2 and weak boson pair production at the lhc , along with superparticle production . by prescribing a non - zero @xmath33 distribution for @xmath0 and @xmath1 production ,",
    "isajet calculates @xmath0 or @xmath1 plus one parton emission using exact qcd matrix elements .",
    "further jets are developed via the parton shower algorithm .",
    "this procedure generates the expected high @xmath34 and @xmath35 distributions .",
    "the multi - jet production via this method agrees rather well with overall rates for weak boson plus multi - jet production at the tevatron and is in qualitative accord with the merged nlo weak boson production plus parton shower approach advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we use isajet also for the simulation of signal and background events at the lhc .",
    "a toy detector simulation is employed with calorimeter cell size @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the hadronic calorimeter energy resolution is taken to be @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 for the forward region with @xmath41 .",
    "the electromagnetic calorimeter energy resolution is assumed to be @xmath42 .",
    "we use a ua1-like jet finding algorithm with jet cone size @xmath43 and require that @xmath44 gev and @xmath45 .",
    "leptons are considered isolated if they have @xmath46 gev and @xmath47 with visible activity within a cone of @xmath48 of @xmath49 gev .",
    "the strict lepton isolation criterion helps reduce multi - lepton backgrounds from @xmath50 and @xmath51 production .",
    "we identify a hadronic cluster with @xmath52 gev and @xmath53 as a @xmath54-jet if it contains a @xmath55 hadron with @xmath56 gev and @xmath57 within a cone of @xmath58 about the jet axis .",
    "we adopt a @xmath54-jet tagging efficiency of 60% and assume that light quark and gluon jets may be mis - tagged as @xmath54-jets with a probability @xmath59 for @xmath60 gev , @xmath61 for @xmath62 gev , with a linear interpolation for @xmath63 gev@xmath64 250 gev@xcite .",
    "we will compare expectations for sm calibration reactions against a case study from the well - known minimal supergravity ( msugra or cmssm ) model , plus two other case studies with non - universal soft susy breaking terms .",
    "in msugra , given a set of parameters m_0 ,  m_1/2 ,  a_0 ,  ,  sign ( ) , one may calculate the entire superparticle mass spectrum , along with sparticle branching fractions and production cross sections .",
    "the isajet program is used to generate the associated lhc collider events . in our work",
    "we adopt three case studies listed in table [ tab : susy ] .",
    "the msugra point p1 is chosen to give a sparticle mass spectrum which yields a modest rate for production of real @xmath1 bosons from sparticle cascade decays .",
    "point p2 is similar to point p1 except that it is within the context of non - universal higgs models ( nuhm)@xcite , wherein the superpotential @xmath16 parameter is fixed to a higher value ( 400 gev ) so that gluino and squark decays to higher chargino and neutralino states ( which in turn may decay to real @xmath1 bosons ) are kinematically suppressed .",
    "thus , point p1 is expected to yield a significant rate for real @xmath1 bosons in susy events , while point p2 is constructed so that @xmath1 production in cascade decays is suppressed .",
    "finally , point p3 is engineered so as to provide a rather high rate of @xmath1 boson production in cascade decays .",
    "p3 has gut scale gaugino masses @xmath65 gev , while the @xmath66 gaugino mass @xmath67 is just 120 gev .",
    "the non - universal gaugino masses allow @xmath68 decay , and since @xmath69 is produced at a high rate in gluino and squark cascade decays , real @xmath1 bosons are expected to be very common in lhc events for point p3 .",
    ".masses and parameters in  gev units for three cases studies points p1 , p2 and p3 using isajet 7.76 with @xmath70 gev and @xmath71 .",
    "we also list the total tree level sparticle production cross section in fb at the lhc . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "one of the first orders of business for the lhc experiments will be to `` re - discover '' the standard model , _",
    "i.e. _ to make sure that familiar processes like qcd dijet production , @xmath4jets production , @xmath3jets production and @xmath2 production all occur as expected .",
    "in fact , these processes will likely be used as _ calibration _",
    "processes , to calibrate the detectors and to tune standard model monte carlo programs . in this paper",
    ", we have emphasized that low mass susy may already make significant contributions to these familiar sm processes , these susy contributions , if not taken into account , could cause detector mis - calibration , or mis - tuning of sm monte carlo codes .",
    "it will be imperative to check that the sm calibration reactions have _ all _ of the properties expected from these reactions .",
    "we point out several ways in which @xmath3jets , @xmath4jets and @xmath2 production can be checked for contamination from non - sm processes like low mass susy .    in @xmath3jets events , even though initially @xmath72 will not be well - measured , there should still be an obvious excess of @xmath72 from susy contamination .    in @xmath4jets events",
    ", we advocate plotting the @xmath73 ratio versus jet multiplicity",
    ". the sm prediction should grow with jet multiplicity due to the presence of @xmath2 contributions .",
    "however , susy contamination is likely to upset the expected ratios , especially at high jet multiplicity .    in @xmath2 events , we advocate comparing the shape of the trijet distribution which reconstructs @xmath22 against sm expectations . in addition",
    ", the dilepton - to - single - lepton event ratio can be sensitive to susy contamination , as can the presence of a high rate of same - sign dileptons .",
    "only if all the properties from the sm processes accurately match the data can they be used with a high degree of confidence for calibrations .",
