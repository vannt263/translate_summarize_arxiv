    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics is remarkably successful in explaining a wide range of microscopic phenomena and has passed numerous tests over the past few decades .",
    "the only ingredient of this model that has yet to be discovered is the higgs boson .",
    "it is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of this field that breaks the electroweak ( ew ) symmetry @xmath0 down to @xmath1 of quantum electrodynamics and provides masses for elementary particles in the sm .",
    "however , this picture , though economical , leaves some intriguing questions unanswered .",
    "one obvious and central question is related to the patterns of the sm fermion masses ( that , including the neutrinos , span 12 orders of magnitude ! ) and mixing ; this is the _ flavor puzzle _ and is based on firm experimental evidence .",
    "another question , which is more theoretical in nature , arises when one considers the effect of quantum corrections on the higgs vev .",
    "these corrections are quadratically sensitive to any physical mass scales that could emerge at energies above the weak scale @xmath2  gev .",
    "however , stringent requirements from precision data strongly suggest that new physics can only appear at scales much larger than @xmath3 .",
    "besides , very high physical scales are well - motivated in the context of a grand unified theory ( gut ) or theories of quantum gravity .",
    "therefore , one is faced with the question of what stabilizes the higgs potential well below such large scales .",
    "the severest version of this problem arises when the fundamental cutoff scale is assumed to be near the 4d planck mass @xmath4  gev ; this is the _ hierarchy problem_.    in this review , we will focus on a framework based on a model originally proposed by randall and sundrum @xcite to address the hierarchy problem .",
    "the randall - sundrum ( rs ) model is based on a slice of ads@xmath5 spacetime between two flat 4d boundaries , often referred to as the uv ( planck ) and ir ( tev ) branes .",
    "the branes are assumed to be separated by a distance of order the curvature radius of the background , which is in turn of order the 5d fundamental scale @xmath6 .",
    "this model provides a natural resolution of the hierarchy , by exponentially generating the weak scale from scales of order @xmath7 . to achieve this ,",
    "the higgs field is localized at the ir - brane and the warping along the fifth dimension redshifts the planckian 5d higgs vev down to the weak scale .",
    "the requisite brane separation was shown to be easily obtained in simple models @xcite , resulting in a stable geometry .    in the original rs model all sm fields were localized on the ir - brane and the most distinct signature of this setup was the emergence of a spin-2 tower of kaluza - klein ( kk )",
    "gravitons @xcite at the tev scale .",
    "however , it was soon realized that resolving the hierarchy only required the higgs to be ir - localized @xcite and other fields could propagate in the 5d bulk .",
    "the sm gauge sector @xcite and the fermions @xcite were then promoted to 5d fields .",
    "it was shown that localization of fermion zero modes could be achieved using 5d mass terms @xcite , with the heavy fermions localized toward the higgs and the light fields localized away from the higgs , resulting in a natural and predictive model of flavor . in particular , given that 5d location sets the relevant physical mass scale in the rs background , light - flavor 4-fermion operators are governed by large cutoff scales in warped flavor models @xcite , as required by precision data .",
    "this interesting feature allows one to address both the hierarchy and flavor puzzles within rs - type models , making them a very attractive model building framework that can be experimentally tested at the weak scale .",
    "while warped 5d models explain some of the important unresolved issues of the sm to a large extent , they are still subject to a degree of ( fine-)tuning , once confronted with precision ew @xcite and flavor data @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the gist of this tension is traced back to the resolution of the hierarchy problem that would prefer the scale of new physics to be near @xmath3 .",
    "this gives rise to an effective 4d cutoff scale in the tev range , where all non - renormalizable interactions that are not forbidden by a symmetry will emerge , whereas precision data generally require the cutoff scale to be at @xmath8  tev or more . to eliminate such  little hierarchies ,",
    "\" the basic 5d sm structure of warped models have been augmented by various new ingredients , such as larger gauge symmetry groups @xcite , in order to keep the scale of kk modes in the few - tev range .",
    "this would remove the need for inordinate amounts of ( fine-)tuning and also make the models more likely to be testable in various high energy experiments .    even though the most recent warped models of hierarchy and flavor can accommodate kk masses as low as 2 - 3  tev @xcite , the discovery of the signature states quite generically poses a significant challenge .",
    "the basic reason for this originates in the way various states are localized in the bulk : light fermions are uv - localized , whereas the kk modes and heavy fermions are ir - localized .",
    "this suppresses the couplings of the kk modes to light flavors that are important initial ( such as light quarks ) and final ( such as @xmath9 ) states in collider production and detection , respectively .",
    "a volume suppression also affects the couplings of the highly localized kk modes to gauge fields that are spread over the bulk .",
    "hence , in models that explain the flavor problem we end up with suppressed production of kk modes that eventually decay into heavy fields , such as @xmath10 , requiring complicated event reconstructions . also , the heavy final states are highly boosted due to the high mass of the kk parent .",
    "this makes the eventual decays of the heavy final sates into di - jets difficult to distinguish from mono - jets , hence rendering qcd background suppression challenging .",
    "in the first half of this review , we will discuss the theoretical techniques that have been used to analyze the phenomenology of rs - type models .",
    "although our results are of more general applicability , we focus on the most recent prototypical models that incorporate a realistic flavor structure ( bulk sm gauge and fermion fields ) and possibly allow for new physics within reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) . we restrict ourselves to the original rs background and assume that there is a higgs degree of freedom in the low - energy theory .",
    "we survey the phenomenological status of these realistic scenarios , thus providing a guide as to the plausible values of parameters in viable models .",
    "having determined the phenomenologically relevant range of parameters , we will discuss the key collider signatures of warped 5d models in the second half of the review .",
    "our main focus will be models endowed with bulk symmetries that allow for the kk masses to be within the reach of the lhc , without the need for unnatural choices of parameters .",
    "some of the experimental obstacles that these models pose , as well as proposals to overcome such problems , will be outlined .",
    "we will also briefly discuss the expected enhancement of clean signals in  truncated \" warped models whose uv cutoff is well below @xmath11 , but still explain flavor .",
    "we will conclude with a summary .    before closing this introduction",
    ", we would like to emphasize that this review is not meant to be exhaustive or comprehensive .",
    "such an undertaking will require a much longer article due to the large amount of research performed on warped models , over the past several years .",
    "in particular , important cosmological and gravitational effects that have been discussed in a number of interesting works lie outside the scope of our review , but certainly deserve attention in separate or more comprehensive surveys of warped physics . as such ,",
    "we have limited our survey to some of the most generic features of model building and phenomenology . to the extent",
    "possible , we have cited works that are directly or closely related to our discussions . however , unfortunately , many worthy papers have been left out in our review .",
    "we hope that this article will serve to present a sufficiently inclusive account of the status of warped models to motivate the interested reader to pursue further references and delve more deeply into some of the subjects that we have ( not ) considered here .",
    "* _ contributed by e.  pontn and j.  santiago _ * in the first part of this review , we describe the tools that have been used to study the physics of warped extra - dimensional scenarios .",
    "we have put special emphasis on the explanation and comparison of the different techniques used .",
    "we focus on models that incorporate a custodial symmetry , and analyze the constraints from ew precision measurements .",
    "there are also important constraints from flavour data that , under the assumption of strict `` anarchy '' ( that the 5d flavor couplings present no structure at all and are all of the same order , including complex phases ) , can result in rather severe bounds on the new physics .",
    "these constraints depend on parameters different from those relevant for the ew precision constraints and can be evaded without significantly modifying the latter . due to space constraints",
