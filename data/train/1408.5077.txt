    "the nuclear shell model is a standard microscopic theory for describing a many - nucleon system . for doubly closed nuclei , first we consider the lowest ho state expressed with a single slater determinant ( sd ) , an antisymmetrized product of single - particle ho orbits .",
    "to take many - body correlations into account , multi - particle - multi - hole ( @xmath6p-@xmath6h ) configuration mixing calculations are performed by superposing many sd states that include higher ho excitations .",
    "thus far , the _ ab initio _ no - core shell model ( ncsm ) with modern nuclear forces has been developed extensively  @xcite . in the ncsm ,",
    "all nucleons are active , but a crucial approximation is the truncation of maximum ho quanta , which determines the ncsm space . compared to ordinary shell - model effective interactions , the use of realistic nuclear forces requires many sd states in higher major shells to reach convergence because of strong couplings between low- and high - momentum components arising from the tensor component and short - range repulsion of the nuclear force .",
    "the ho expansion provides us with systematic and size extensive calculations , but it is not advantageous to describe the spatial extent of the wave function because of a rapid fall - off of the ho wave functions . if a system exhibits a cluster structure , the subsystems are localized and their relative motion wave function can have a long tail .",
    "for example , the first excited state of @xmath7o is still difficult to reproduce by present large - scale shell - model calculations  @xcite . as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the cluster structure always induces extremely high ho quanta beyond the limitation of present computational resources . to make an efficient description of nuclear many - body systems using the ho expansion , it is useful to know how many ho excitations are required to account for those important correlations which are induced by the tensor force , the short - range repulsion , and the cluster structure .    nowadays , precise wave functions of very light nuclei",
    "can be obtained using _ ab initio _ few - body methods .",
    "though the few - body method can only be applied to very light nuclei , long - ranged asymptotics as well as short - range correlations are accurately described .",
    "such few - body wave functions can provide important hints on how to tackle complicated many - body problems . since the shell model and the few - body model",
    "are formulated in different frameworks , it is convenient to relate the few - body wave function to the ho wave function . for this purpose , by extending the formulation of ref .",

    "the nucleus @xmath8he is an interesting example because important ingredients of many - nucleon dynamics show up in its spectrum .",
    "the ground state is strongly correlated due to the tensor component and short - range repulsion of the nuclear force .",
    "the tensor force induces a @xmath9state mixing of approximately 14%  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , the short - range repulsion makes a strong depression at short distances in the pair correlation function . in the ho expansion ,",
    "this depression of the pairwise relative wave functions at short distances is taken care of by superposing many ho wave functions that have larger @xmath108 with the same @xmath109 , which obviously leads to the large-@xmath73 components .",
    "on the other hand , the tensor correlations induce high-@xmath73 components , because of the couplings between the ho wave functions with different @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath17 distribution actually reflects the momentum distribution .",
    "as we have already mentioned , the realistic interaction demands ho functions with large @xmath73 in the coordinate space . noting that the fourier transform of the ho function in the coordinate space is again the ho function in the momentum space , the ho functions with large @xmath73 certainly contain large - momentum components .",
    "@xcite showed that the momentum distribution has a long tail due to the tensor and short - range correlations .",
    "the ho functions with large @xmath73 play a role in enhancing the high momentum tail of the momentum distribution , whereas those with small @xmath73 describe the mean - field structure below the fermi momentum .",
    "since the inclusion of all the high-@xmath73 components is not practical for heavier nuclei , an effective interaction starting from the realistic @xmath0 interaction is usually employed to accelerate the convergence .",
    "such effective interactions are derived in several approaches , for example , lee - suzuki transformation  @xcite , unitary correlation operator method ( ucom )  @xcite , and similarity renormalization group  @xcite .",

    ", obviously because the state is orthogonal to the ground state whose major configuration is @xmath74 .",
    "the distribution is less interaction - dependent at @xmath111 compared to that of the ground state , which appears to be attributed to the weakly bound @xmath2 cluster structure of the first excited state  @xcite . assuming that the scattering length between @xmath112 and @xmath16 is much larger than its effective range , the system does not depend much on the detail of the interaction .",
    "this universal property is found in atomic systems and its similarity to the first excited @xmath113 state is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . beyond @xmath87 ,",
    "@xmath17 decreases monotonously and very slowly with increasing @xmath73 , and the values of @xmath69 and @xmath70 in the case of the av8@xmath45 + 3nf potential turn out to be 15.3 and 13.3 , respectively .",
    "appreciable probability still exists even at @xmath88 , which is too large for standard shell - model calculations to incorporate  @xcite . from the angular momentum decomposition of @xmath17 we find out that the @xmath100 component , @xmath114 , dominates over the whole @xmath73 region .",
    "this is also consistent with the fact that the @xmath10 state has an @xmath11-wave @xmath2 cluster structure .",
    "if a state has a cluster structure , its @xmath17 distribution spreads over large @xmath73 because describing the relative motion between the clusters up to the asymptotic region requires configurations with large @xmath73 , even though the intrinsic wave functions of the clusters do not contain high ho excitations  @xcite .",
