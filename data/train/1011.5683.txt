    "this means that the parallel translation with respect to the connection @xmath15 does not depend on the path if and only if all these curvature tensors vanish .",
    "one of the main steps of v.wagners construction is an extension of the metric @xmath13 given on @xmath12 to the first prolongation @xmath16 of @xmath12 , where @xmath16 is the distribution generated by the lie brackets of vector fields tangent to @xmath12 .",

    "in @xcite we calculated the curvature tensor of @xmath5 , found the differential equations for the projections of geodesics of @xmath5 onto @xmath3 ( see of the present paper ) , and described the wagner lift for the metrics @xmath4 of constant curvature @xmath36 .",
    "it is worth noting that v.wagners metric extension can be applied only to completely nonholonomic distributions , and in our case the distribution @xmath12 is completely nonholonomic if and only if the curvature @xmath7 of @xmath0 does not vanish .",
