    "one of the most interesting topics in nuclear structure is the study of nuclei near the limits of particle stability .",
    "much attention is currently being focused on nuclei in the regions of shell closures off stability , in particular the @xmath0sn and @xmath3sn neighbors .",
    "these nuclei , unlike those in the @xmath4pb region , were until recently not accessible to spectroscopic studies .",
    "new data are now becoming available for them , which provide a challenging testing ground for the effective interaction and allow exploring the evolution of the shell structure when approaching the proton and neutron drip lines .    to test the effective interaction between unlike nucleons , in a recent paper @xcite we have studied nuclei with proton particles and neutron holes around @xmath3sn .",
    "this study has been performed within the framework of the shell model making use of the cd - bonn nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath5 ) potential @xcite .",
    "we have considered @xmath3sn as a closed core and derived the proton - neutron effective interaction explicitly in the particle - hole ( @xmath6 ) formalism .",
    "actually , a similar study @xcite was performed for the heavier proton particle - neutron hole nucleus @xmath4bi more than thirty years ago , employing @xmath6 matrix elements derived from the hamada - johnston potential @xcite . since then , however , substantial progress has been made in both the development of high - quality @xmath5 potentials and many - body methods for deriving the effective interaction , which has stimulated our study of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the results obtained in @xcite are in good agreement with the experimental data , thus evidencing the reliability of our proton particle - neutron hole matrix elements in the @xmath3sn region .",
    "a relevant outcome of our study is that all multiplets in the two odd - odd nuclei @xmath3sb and @xmath7sb show the same peculiar behavior , which is consistent with the available experimental data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the same behavior was evidenced for the multiplets in @xmath4bi @xcite , which was well reproduced by the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of a study of @xmath0sn neighbors performed along the same lines of ref . @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we consider the three odd - odd nuclei @xmath0 in , @xmath2ag , and @xmath1 in . clearly , the most appropriate system to study the neutron particle - proton hole multiplets in this mass region is @xmath0 in with only one neutron valence particle and one proton valence hole .",
    "although no experimental information is yet available for this nucleus , we have found it interesting to predict some of its spectroscopic properties to gain insight into the effects of the neutron - proton effective interaction in the @xmath0sn region also in the light of what we have learned from the study of nuclei around @xmath3sn .",
    "we hope that this may stimulate further experimental efforts to access this highly important nucleus .",
    "some experimental information is instead available for the two neighboring odd - odd nuclei @xmath2ag and @xmath1 in , which have two additional proton holes and two additional neutrons with respect to @xmath0 in , respectively .",
    "the study of the @xmath6 multiplets in these nuclei not only is interesting in its own right , but also provides a rather stringent test of the reliability of our predictions for @xmath0 in .",
    "preliminary results for @xmath2ag and @xmath1 in have been already presented in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have also reported some results for @xmath4bi , which turn out to be in better agreement with experiment than those of the early realistic calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follow . in sec .",
    "ii we give a brief description of our calculations focusing attention on the choice of the neutron single - particle ( sp ) and the proton single - hole ( sh ) energies .",
    "our results are presented and compared with the experimental data in sec .",
    "section iv contains a discussion and a summary of our conclusions .",
    "we assume that @xmath0sn is a closed core and let the valence neutrons occupy the five levels @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 of the 50 - 82 shell , while for the proton holes the model space includes the four levels @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 of the 28 - 50 shell . as input to our shell - model calculations",
    "we need the neutron sp and the proton sh energies as well as the two - body matrix elements of the effective interaction .",
    "as regards the latter , the calculation for @xmath0 in requires only the neutron - proton matrix elements in the @xmath6 formalism , while for @xmath2ag and @xmath1 in we also need proton - proton and neutron - neutron matrix elements in the hole - hole ( @xmath17 ) and particle - particle ( @xmath18 ) formalism , respectively .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , our effective interaction has been derived from the cd - bonn @xmath5 potential @xcite .",
    "the difficulty posed by the strong short - range repulsion contained in the bare potential has been overcome by constructing a renormalized low - momentum potential , @xmath19 , that preserves the physics of the original potential up to a certain cut - off momentum @xmath20 .",
    "the latter is a smooth potential that can be used directly in the calculation of shell - model effective interactions .",
    "a detailed description of our derivation of @xmath19 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present paper , we have used for @xmath20 the value 2.1 @xmath21 .",
    "once the @xmath19 is obtained , the calculation of the effective interaction is carried out within the framework of the @xmath22-box plus folded diagram method @xcite . in the calculation of @xmath23",
    "we have included diagrams up to second order in @xmath19 .",
    "a description of the derivation of the effective interaction in the @xmath18 and @xmath17 formalism can be found in refs . @xcite and @xcite , respectively , while the matrix elements in the @xmath6 formalism have been explicitly derived in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as regards the neutron sp and proton sh energies , they can not be taken from experiment , since no spectroscopic data are yet available for @xmath24sn and @xmath25 in . in two previous papers ,",
    "we have determined them by an analysis of the low - energy spectra of the odd sn isotopes with @xmath26 for the former @xcite and of the @xmath27 isotones with @xmath28 for the latter @xcite .",
    "recently , however , the @xmath29 ground state and the first - excited @xmath30 state have been identified in @xmath31sn @xcite .",
    "we have therefore found it appropriate to include these states in our analysis of the sn isotopes , which yields the value of 0.010 mev for @xmath32 , as compared to the value of -0.200 mev adopted in ref .",
    "for the sake completeness , the values of the neutron sp and proton sh energies adopted in the present calculation are reported in table i.    .proton single - hole and neutron single - particle energies ( in mev ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to conclude this section , it is worthwhile to comment on the @xmath33 spacing . from the experiment we know that the @xmath34 isotones with @xmath35 are characterized by a @xmath36 ground state with the excitation energy of the @xmath37 state going down when approaching the proton shell closure .",
    "furthermore , the data for the light sn isotopes indicate that the @xmath38 and @xmath39 levels should lie close in energy , no subshell effect being observed as evidenced by the constancy of the excitation energy of the first @xmath40 state up to @xmath41sn .",
    "however , the spacing between these two levels can not be firmly established from the available experimental data and it is still an open question the ordering of the @xmath39 and @xmath38 level in @xmath24sn .",
    "the sp energies of the @xmath42 and @xmath43 levels adopted in this study are almost degenerate , with the @xmath43 level lying only 10 kev below the @xmath42 one .",
    "it should be pointed out , however , that this choice is based on the above mentioned analysis of the light sn isotopes with @xmath44 .",
    "it therefore depends on the @xmath45 neutron - neutron matrix elements of the effective interaction . on these grounds",
    ", we consider that our value may be subject to an uncertainty of the order of 100 kev .",
    "we now present the results of our calculations for the neutron - proton multiplets in @xmath0 in , @xmath2ag , and @xmath1 in and compare them with the experimental data .",
    "all calculations have been performed using the oxbash shell - model code @xcite .",
    "the calculated results are represented by open circles while the experimental data by solid triangles .",
    "the lines are drawn to connect the points . ]",
    "let us start with @xmath0 in .",
    "first we note that the wave functions for low - lying states have little configuration mixing and can be then grouped into multiplets . in fig .",
    "1 we show our predictions for the @xmath46 and @xmath47 multiplets . for both of them",
    "the weight of the leading component in each member is at least 77% , the remaining percentage in the states of the @xmath46 multiplet coming from the @xmath47 configuration and vice versa .    from fig .",
    "1 we see that the two multiplets have a similar shape with a splitting between the centroid energies of about 400 kev , the centroid of the @xmath47 multiplet being the highest one .",
    "since the @xmath39 and @xmath38 neutron levels are almost degenerate , this splitting can be only attributed to the difference between the average energy contribution of the neutron - proton interaction for the two different configurations .",
    "this implies therefore that the matrix elements of the effective interaction , which is essentially repulsive in the particle - hole channel , are generally stronger for the states of the @xmath47 multiplet .",
    "this is also characterized by a larger dispersion ( @xmath48 kev ) as compared to that ( @xmath49 kev ) of the @xmath46 multiplet .    as regards the shape of the two multiplets , we see from fig .",
    "1 that it is a main feature of both of them that the states with the minimum and maximum @xmath50 have the highest excitation energy , while the state with next to the highest @xmath50 is the lowest one .",
    "this reflects the very small contribution of the effective interaction ( either attractive or repulsive ) to the @xmath51 state , the largest repulsive effect occurring for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 states .",
    "it is just this feature that causes the first and last states of the @xmath46 multiplet to lie above the @xmath40 and @xmath54 members of the @xmath47 multiplet . as can be seen from fig .",
    "1 , all the other members of the @xmath46 multiplet are instead yrast states .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the configuration mixing also contributes to further split the two @xmath40 and the two @xmath54 states .",
    "the peculiar behavior exhibited by the proton hole - neutron multiplets in @xmath0 in turns out to be quite similar to that of the multiplets in the proton particle - neutron hole nuclei @xmath3sb and @xmath4bi , which we have discussed in the introduction .",
    "this pattern appears to be typical of the particle - hole multiplets in odd - odd nuclei irrespective of the mass region and the nature of the hole , either a proton or a neutron .",
    "this similarity makes evident that the main features of the effective interaction in the @xmath6 channel are essentially the same in the @xmath0sn , @xmath3sn , and @xmath4pb regions .",
    "note that we have found that no significant role is played by the configuration mixing and therefore the behavior of each multiplet is essentially determined by the matrix elements of the effective interaction for the corresponding configuration .    in .",
    "the lines are drawn to connect the points . ]",
    "we now would like to draw attention to our results as regards the spin and parity of the ground state .",
    "the nature of this state is of great interest since it may provide information on the @xmath55 neutron spacing @xcite .",
    "we predict the ground state of @xmath0 in to be the @xmath56 member of the @xmath46 multiplet , while the @xmath57 state , which originates from the @xmath47 configuration , lies at 110 kev excitation energy .",
    "we have found that to obtain the latter as ground state the @xmath58 level should go at least 200 kev below the @xmath59 one .",
    "this value is needed to compensate for the effect of the repulsive effective interaction , which , as mentioned above , is stronger in the @xmath47 configuration .",
    "however , based on our previous discussion ( see sec .",
    "ii ) , such a spacing seems to be too large .",
    "let us now come to @xmath2ag and @xmath1 in which are the odd - odd nuclei closest to @xmath0sn for which some experimental information is available .",
    "the calculated multiplets @xmath47 and @xmath46 for @xmath2ag and @xmath1 in are reported in figs . 2 and 3 , respectively , where they are compared with the experimental data @xcite .",
    "we have identified as members of the multiplets the states dominated by the corresponding @xmath6 configuration with the two remaining proton holes or neutron particles forming a zero - coupled pair . in both nuclei",
    "we have found that the calculated yrast and yrare states with angular momentum from 2 to 7 belong to one of the two multiplets , while the @xmath60 member of the @xmath47 multiplet turns out to be the second excited @xmath60 state .",
    "as for the @xmath61 member of the latter multiplet , we find that it is the third @xmath62 state in @xmath2ag and the fourth one in @xmath1 in .    in .",
    "]    it is worth mentioning that the percentage of components other than those characterizing the multiplets is rather large in all states reported in figs . 2 and 3 , exceeding 50% for some of them .",
    "we have verified that this mixing is rather sensitive to the spacing between the @xmath38 and @xmath39 neutron levels . for instance , if one takes the @xmath58 level 200 kev above the @xmath42 one , the two @xmath40 , as well as the two @xmath54 , states in @xmath1 in change their nature , namely the yrast state become a member the @xmath46 multiplet while the yrare a member of the @xmath47 multiplet . however , the pattern of each multiplet in both nuclei is on the whole not affected by changes in the @xmath55 neutron spacing , remaining quite similar to that of the corresponding multiplet in @xmath0 in .",
    "let us now come to the comparison with the experimental data . in this connection , some comments on the values reported in figs .",
    "2 and 3 are in order .",
    "as regards @xmath2ag , we have included the first six low lying states , assuming the @xmath63 and @xmath64 levels at 0.515 and 1.066 mev , respectively , to have both @xmath65 as suggested by our calculations .",
    "we have not included the experimental @xmath60 state at 1.115 mev , which has been identified with our first calculated @xmath60 state at 1.315 mev .",
    "it should also be noted that none of the experimental @xmath61 states has been reported , since no safe identification can be made with our calculated @xmath61 state reported in fig .",
    "the experimental data shown in fig . 3 for @xmath1 in include only three states : the ground state for which we have adopted @xmath66 according to refs .",
    "@xcite , and the two first excited states both with @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath60 at 0.980 mev has not been reported since , as for @xmath2ag , it has been identified with our first @xmath60 at 1.210 mev . from figs . 2 and 3 we see that the calculated energies are in good agreement with the experimental ones , the largest discrepancy being 200 kev for the second @xmath54 state in @xmath1 in .",
    "we conclude by noting that our calculations predict for the ground state of the three nuclei considered @xmath68 .",
    "we have verified that this result is independent of reasonable changes in the @xmath55 neutron spacing .",
    "in this work , we have performed shell - model calculations for @xmath0 in , @xmath2ag , and @xmath1 in , which are the immediate odd - odd neighbors of doubly magic @xmath0sn .",
    "the effective interaction has been derived from the cd - bonn nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite , making use of a new approach @xcite to the renormalization of the short - range repulsion of the nucleon - nucleon potential .",
    "the main aim of this work has been to study the particle - hole multiplets in this region to obtain information on the neutron - proton effective interaction .",
    "we have found that the proton hole - neutron multiplets in the three above nuclei exhibit the same behavior as that of the multiplets in the proton particle - neutron hole nuclei around doubly magic @xmath4pb and @xmath3sn .",
    "namely , the highest- and lowest - spin members of each multiplet have the highest excitation energy , while the state with next to @xmath52 is the lowest , the latter feature being in agreement with the predictions of the brennan - bernstein coupling rule @xcite . this pattern , which is essentially independent of the mass region , can be directly related to the effective interaction between unlike nucleons in the particle - hole channel .",
    "in fact , the diagonal matrix elements of the effective interaction for a given configuration show the same behavior , the configuration mixing , as mentioned in sec .",
    "iii , playing a minor role . in this connection",
    ", we would like to mention the work of ref .",
    "@xcite , where empirical neutron particle - proton hole matrix elements have been used .",
    "these have been determined by fitting the energies of 150 levels in 10 nuclei with @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the diagonal matrix elements for the @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 configurations are reported and it is interesting to note that their behavior is somewhat different from that of our realistic matrix elements .",
    "in fact , while the @xmath53 and @xmath52 matrix elements still have the largest values , the matrix element with @xmath74 is not the smallest one , except for the @xmath72 configuration .    to conclude this discussion",
    ", it is worth mentioning that in refs .",
    "@xcite we have reported the diagonal matrix elements of our effective interaction for some configurations in @xmath0 in , @xmath4bi , and @xmath3sb . from an analysis of these matrix elements it turned out that the renormalizations of the @xmath19 potential due to core - polarization processes , although not very large in magnitude , are quite relevant for the pattern of the particle - hole multiplets .",
    "as regards the comparison with experiment , we have shown that the data available for the two odd - odd nuclei @xmath2ag and @xmath1 in are well reproduced by our calculations providing confidence in our predictions for @xmath0 in .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that for the ground state of this nucleus we predict @xmath75 originating from the @xmath72 multiplet .",
    "this result turns out to be quite insensitive to reasonable changes in the @xmath76 neutron spacing .",
