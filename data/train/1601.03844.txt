    "the physical properties of interfaces between complex oxides are of great current interest  @xcite .",
    "a prominent example is the interface between the two band insulators @xmath5 and @xmath6 at which highly mobile carriers are confined and give rise to electronic and superconducting phenomena that can be tuned with a gate voltage  @xcite .",
    "another interesting example involves the magnetic proximity effect ( mpe ) at the interface between the cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductor ( sc ) @xmath1 ( ybco ) and ferromagnet ( fm ) @xmath2 ( lcmo )  @xcite .",
    "with polarized neutron reflectometry ( pnr ) it was found that , in the vicinity of the interface , the fm order of the mn moments is strongly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon has been discussed in terms of a _ _ or a _ _ .",
    "in addition , it was shown with x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) that the interfacial cu ions acquire a ferromagnetic moment of about 0.2@xmath7 which is antiparallel to the one of mn  @xcite .",
    "recent x - ray resonant magnetic reflectometry ( xrmr ) studies have demonstrated that these cu moments reside in the interfacial cuo@xmath3 planes  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , x - ray linear dichroism ( xld ) studies revealed that the interfacial cu ions undergo an orbital reconstruction which yields a large hole density in the cu @xmath4 orbitals ( that are almost fully occupied in the bulk )  @xcite .",
    "both the orbital reconstruction and the magnetic moment of the interfacial cu ions have been explained in terms of a strong hybridization between the cu and mn @xmath4 orbitals which leads to an antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( af - ei ) between the cu and mn spins  @xcite . in this context , the ferromagnetic cu moment is induced by the af - ei with the mn moments , and one expects that the magnitude of this cu moment is proportional to the strength of this coupling  @xcite .",
    "we have performed xmcd , xld and pnr measurements on a series of ybco / lcmo multilayers ( mls ) for which the strength of the af - ei between cu and mn has been altered by changing the electronic and magnetic properties of the lcmo layers . as described in the experimental section ,",
    "this goal has been achieved by changing the growth and annealing conditions , as well as the thickness of the lcmo layers . to our surprise , we have found that the magnitude of the fm cu moment is almost independent of the strength of the af - ei with mn , i.e. , it remains sizeable if the af - ei is strongly reduced or even absent .",
    "this suggests that the fm order of the cu moments is not induced by the coupling to the fm mn moments of lcmo or by a transfer of spin - polarized charge carriers .",
    "instead , this cu moment seems to be intrinsic to the interfacial cuo@xmath3 planes .",

    "finally , in subsection  [ result - yltheory ] we provide an explanation of the intrinsic nature of the ferromagnetic cu moment in terms of the modification of the intra - planar cu - cu exchange interaction that is brought about by the so - called orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu ions .",

    "the xmcd signal , i.e. , the difference between the absorptions for the left and right circularly polarized x - rays , has been obtained in the total electron yield ( tey ) and total fluorescence yield ( tfy ) modes . due to the limited escape depth of the photo - electrons of only few nanometers ,",
    "the tey mode is very surface sensitive .",
    "since the mls are terminated with lcmo , the tey cu xmcd signal is governed by the cu ions at the uppermost ybco / lcmo interface .",

    "the cu xmcd is always negative and almost saturates above 1 t .",
    "the corresponding mn xmcd is positive with a similar saturation behavior .",
    "this is the signature of the antiparallel orientation of the cu and mn moments that was interpreted in terms of a strong af - ei between cu and mn  @xcite .    for @xmath11 ,",
    "the cu xmcd exhibits a remarkably different behavior .",
    "it is also negative at first , but above 1 t it reveals a paramagnet - like trend with a zero crossing around 3 t .",
    "the sign change is also evident from the cu xmcd curves at 0.5 t and 6 t in figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( b ) ( middle panel ) .",

    "strikingly , similar xmcd field scans have indeed been reported for a molecular system with a weak af coupling between cr and dy moments  @xcite .",
    "finally , for @xmath12 , the cu xmcd signal is always positive suggesting that the af - ei with mn is entirely suppressed .",
    "this suppression of the af - ei is expected since the mn moments themselves are hardly ferromagnetic .",
    "the surprising result is that there is still no sign of a reduction of the magnitude of the maximal cu xmcd signal and thus of the interfacial cu moment .",
    "for the three kinds of samples yl_1 - 3 , the sum rule  @xcite analysis yields rather similar effective spin moments of @xmath60@xmath7 per interfacial cu ion .",
    "first of all , it is important to clarify whether both the negative and the positive cu xcmd signals originate from the cuo@xmath3 planes next to the interface with lcmo or whether the latter is due to the bulk - like cu ions in the more distant cuo@xmath3 planes . the second possibility that the paramagnetic cu xcmd originates from bulk - like cu ions , has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite which reported similar xmcd data for corresponding lsco / lcmo mls .",
    "nevertheless , as shown in the following , we can exclude such a two component scenario for the case of these ybco / lcmo mls .",

    "the interfacial and bulk - like cu ions give rise to distinct peaks  @xcite in the xas curves .",
    "in particular , the low - energy peak around 930.4ev ( for which the position is marked by a dotted line in figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( d)-(g ) ) originates from the interfacial cu ions since it is much stronger in the tey mode ( figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( e ) ) which primarily probes the cu ions at the topmost ybco / lcmo interface , than in the tfy mode ( figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( d ) ) .",
    "the negative xld ( @xmath61 ) of the @xmath62  ev peak , as compared to the positive one of the peaks at 931.0 and 931.7ev due to the bulk - like cuo@xmath3 planes , is the fingerprint of the orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cuo@xmath3 plane  @xcite .",
    "the red - shift of the peak at 930.4ev can be understood in terms of a charge transfer between lcmo and ybco  @xcite .",
    "the cu xmcd curves of @xmath11 in figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( f ) and  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( g ) highlight that the xmcd originates predominantly from the peak at 930.4ev and thus from the interfacial cu ions .",
    "this applies to the positive cu xmcd signal at 6 t as much as to the negative one at 0.5 t . in figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( g )",
    "there is also a very weak paramagnetic contribution from the peak at 931ev due to the bulk - like cu ions .",
    "this paramagnetic signal is however at least an order of magnitude smaller than the one from the interfacial cu ions .",
    "note that this conclusion is independent of the particular fitting procedure that is used to account for the different peaks .",
    "the essential effect is even seen in the bare spectra where the position of the peak of @xmath63 in tey mode ( solid blue circles in figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( e ) ) coincides with the one of the maximum in the xmcd signal ( solid gray symbols in figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( f )  and  ( g ) ) . an additional argument against the two - component scenario of ref .",
    "@xcite is that such a paramagnetic signal is not observed in @xmath10 , despite the circumstance that this sample contains the same amount of bulk - like cu ions as @xmath11 .",
    "this puts the focus on the magnetic properties of the interfacial cu ions and the questions , firstly , why the af - ei with the mn moments on the lcmo side is so strongly reduced in the @xmath11 type samples and , secondly , why the magnitude of the ferromagnetic cu moment is independent of the strength of the exchange coupling with mn .",
    "concerning the first question we note that , based on the x - ray diffraction and reflectometry data , the structural quality , and the roughness of the ybco / lcmo interfaces are comparable for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( 10  bl repetitions ) type samples .",
    "furthermore , we find that whereas the roughness of the respective interface of the @xmath11 type sample with 1  bl repetition is only about 6 ( discussed in figure  [ fig - xrd ]  ( b ) ) , the characteristics of the cu xmcd signal is very similar to the one shown ( in figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ] ) for the @xmath11 10  bls sample that has a larger roughness of 10 .",
    "therefore , the strong suppression of the af - ei in @xmath11 is not the result of an increased interface roughness .",
    "furthermore , the tem study in figure  [ fig - tem - eels ] has shown that @xmath11 has the same interfacial stacking ( termination ) as it was reported in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10 , i.e. , with a sequence of cuo@xmath3-bao - mno@xmath3 layers that results in a straight cu - o@xmath64-mn bond across the ybco / lcmo interface ( and vice versa for the lcmo / ybco interface ) .",
    "this kind of interface termination is corroborated by the cu xld data which show no significant differences between these samples ( see figure  1  ( a)-(d ) of ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath10 , figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( d )  and  ( e ) for @xmath11 , and figure  [ cu - xld - yl3 ]  ( a )  and  ( b ) for @xmath12 ) .",
    "they suggest that these samples have a very similar charge transfer and orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu ions .",
    "in particular , the orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu ions , which is determined by the covalent bonding between the cu and mn ions , should be strongly affected by a change of the interfacial layer stacking .",
    "it was previously discussed that a strong covalent bonding requires a direct cu - o@xmath64-mn bond  @xcite and shown that other kinds of interfacial layer stacking result in a much weaker orbital reconstruction effect  @xcite .",
    "next , one may suspect that in @xmath11 the fm order of the mn moments is more strongly suppressed at the interface with ybco than in @xmath10 .",
    "this may be a result of the different growth and annealing conditions of the lcmo layers which in @xmath11 may weaken the fm double exchange interaction between the mn moments and strengthen the competing af interactions .",
    "such a reduction of the mn moment in the vicinity of the interfaces with ybco has already been observed in the @xmath10 sample and was discussed in terms of a _ _",
    "naturally , one might assume that this suppression of the fm order of the interfacial mn moments is even stronger in @xmath11 .",

    "the magnetic moment in the central part of lcmo amounts to about @xmath71@xmath7 per mn ion . ]",
    "this puts the emphasis on the exchange coupling mechanism across the interface .",
    "it was previously shown that the ybco / lcmo mls have an interface termination with a layer stacking sequence of cuo@xmath3-y - cuo@xmath3-bao - mno@xmath3-(la , ca)o at both the ybco / lcmo and lcmo / ybco interfaces ( one plane of cuo chains per ybco layer is missing )  @xcite .",
    "this termination thus yields a covalent cu - o - mn bond across the interface which according to ref .",
    "@xcite is at the heart of the charge transfer and the orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu ions .",
    "the corresponding feature in the cu xas spectra is the red - shifted peak at 930.4ev that is strongly enhanced in tey mode and exhibits only a weak cu xld signal ( as opposed to the large cu xld signal of the bulk - like cu ions ) .",
    "we find that these characteristic features due to the charge transfer and the orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu ions are equally present in the cu xld spectra of the samples @xmath10 ( see figure  1  ( a)-(d ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , @xmath11 ( see figure  [ fig - cu - xmcd ]  ( d )  and  ( e ) ) and @xmath12 ( see appendix  [ app - xld - yl3 ] ) . in return , this suggests that these samples do not exhibit any significant differences concerning the interface termination , the resulting charge transfer and the orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu ions . in the following",
    "we show that the most significant changes occur indeed with respect to the electronic properties of the lcmo layers",
    ". a clear reduction of the conductivity of the lcmo layers in @xmath11 , as compared to the one in @xmath10 , is evident from electric transport data in figure  [ fig - rt - rh ] and also from the infrared spectroscopy data in figure  [ fig - optics ] .",
    "the r - t data in figure  [ fig - rt - rh ]  ( a ) show that the kink in the resistance around @xmath30 , which is a signature of the transition from a paramagnetic insulator to a ferromagnetic metal in the lcmo layers , is fairly pronounced for @xmath10 whereas it is hardly visible for @xmath11 .",
    "the r - h curves in figure  [ fig - rt - rh ]  ( b ) show that the corresponding magneto - resistance effect in the vicinity of @xmath30 is much smaller for @xmath11 than for @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the infrared spectra in figure  [ fig - optics ]  ( b ) confirm that the increase of the drude peak below @xmath30 , which is a hallmark of the concomitant insulator - to - metal and paramagnet - to - fm transition of lcmo  @xcite , is much weaker in @xmath11 than in @xmath10 .",
    "for the former a significant fraction of the spectral weight is instead accumulated in a broad mid - infrared ( mir ) band .",
    "the development below @xmath30 of such a mir band is well known from bulk manganites that are in the less hole doped part of the phase diagram close to the insulating fm ( i - fm ) phase where the charge carriers start to form fm polarons  @xcite .",
    "the signatures of this mir band are also seen in a corresponding ml with lamno@xmath72 ( lmo ) layers that are known to be in the i - fm state  @xcite ( see figure  [ fig - optics ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "this mir band is therefore a fingerprint of the fm polarons which are predicted to give rise to a particular local orbital order  @xcite which involves an alternating occupation of the @xmath73-@xmath74 orbitals of the mn@xmath75 ions as shown in figure  [ fig7-polaron - coupling ]  ( a ) .",
    "notably , the orbital occupation can have a profound effect on the exchange interaction with the interfacial cu ions .",
    "this is shown by the scheme in figure  [ fig7-polaron - coupling ]  ( b ) which illustrates that the exchange interaction is af if the mn @xmath4 level is occupied , whereas it becomes fm if the in - plane polarized orbital is occupied .",
    "shown , for simplicity , is the extreme case for which the orbital reconstruction yields a complete inversion of the occupation of the cu @xmath76 and @xmath4 orbitals .",

    "the inset magnifies the low energy part of @xmath80 . ]            the strong af - ei in @xmath10 accordingly can be understood in terms of a preferred occupation of the mn @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "such an effect is indeed suggested by the tey mn xld data in figure  [ figure8-mnxld ]  ( a ) which yield an electron polarization of the @xmath83-orbitals of p@xmath84@xmath85% ( as detailed in the appendix  [ app - peg ] ) . on the other hand , the scheme in figure  [ figure8-mnxld ]  ( b )",
    "shows how the presence of the fm polarons in @xmath11 can reduce the strength of the af - ei .",
    "it displays the spatial arrangement of the occupied cu and mn @xmath83-orbitals close to the interface due to a fm polaron lattice for the representative case of a doping of @xmath86 .",
    "it gives rise to an alternation of the in - plane and out - of - plane polarization of the occupied mn @xmath83-orbitals along the lateral direction and , accordingly ( see figure  [ fig7-polaron - coupling ]  ( b ) ) , to a sign change of the exchange interaction with the cu ions .",
    "needless to say that the scheme in figure  [ figure8-mnxld ]  ( b ) shows a simplified and qualitative picture of how the presence of the fm polarons leads to a reduction of the af - ei between the interfacial mn and cu moments , even in the presence of a strong fm order of the mn moments . in the lcmo layers of @xmath11",
    ", these fm polarons may still be partially dynamic and strongly disordered .",
    "nevertheless , especially in the vicinity of the interfaces , they can be pinned and thus contribute significantly to the suppression of the net af - ei with the cu moments .",
    "the presence of these fm polarons can also explain the smaller thickness of the _ _ in @xmath11 since they make the fm order of the mn moments more robust against the interfacial strain and disorder effects .",
    "finally , we remark that in line with this orbital polaron scenario , for which the average polarization of the mn @xmath83-orbitals should vanish ( see appendix  [ app - polaron - xld ] ) , the mn xld signal of @xmath11 in figure  [ figure8-mnxld ]  ( a ) yields a reduced value of p@xmath84@xmath87% .",

    "this brings us to the second question , that has been formulated at the beginning of subsection  [ result - pnr ] , about the origin of the intrinsic cu moment of the interfacial cuo@xmath3 plane .",
    "we suggest that this is due to its strongly underdoped state which arises from the electron transfer from lcmo to ybco and the lack of a cuo chain layer which serves as a charge reservoir  @xcite and to the orbital reconstruction . in a bulk - like environment , where the holes reside mainly in cu @xmath76 orbitals , there would be a strongly af intra - planar exchange interaction between the cu moments which suppresses the corresponding cu xmcd signal .",
    "nevertheless , for the cu ions in the cuo@xmath3 plane next to the ybco / lcmo interface , the occupation of the @xmath83-orbitals is substantially different : the concentration of holes in the cu @xmath4 orbitals is approximately the same as in the cu @xmath76 orbtials .",
    "this is the so called orbital reconstruction effect that was reported in ref .",

    "it can be seen , that for high ( low ) values of @xmath90 , @xmath88 of the ground state is close to 1 ( close to 0 ) , as expected . for intermediate values in the range from ca -0.2 ev to ca -0.05 ev , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "clearly , the ground state properties for this particular range may be of relevance in the context of considerations of orbitally reconstructed cuo@xmath119 planes at the ybco / lcmo interfaces .",
    "figure  [ fig9 - 10 ]  ( b ) shows the @xmath90 dependence of the total spin of the cluster in its ground state and in the first excited state .",
    "interestingly , with decreasing @xmath90 the spin state of the ground state changes from a singlet at high values of @xmath90 to a quintuplet ( spins of the four holes parallel ) to a singlet at low values of @xmath90 .",
    "the quintuplet occurs precisely in the same @xmath90-window as the 0.4-plateau in @xmath88 . for completeness",
    "we show in figure  [ fig9 - 10 ]  ( c ) the @xmath90 dependence of the energies of the ground state and of the first excited state . note the crossings between the singlet line and the quintuplet line .",
    "the trend of the total spin can be qualitatively understood as follows . for high values of @xmath90 the holes",
    "are located mainly in the @xmath89 orbitals and the standard superexchange mechanism involving virtual hoppings between these orbitals stabilizes the singlet ground state . in the large @xmath120 limit",
    "the ground state can be even described analytically  @xcite . with decreasing @xmath90",
    ", more and more holes enter the @xmath103 orbitals , and at certain critical value of @xmath90 , virtual hoppings within @xmath121 configurations begin to play a more important role than those within the @xmath122 configurations and stabilize the ferromagnetic ( quintuplet ) ground state . the reason for why the former hoppings support the ferromagnetic configuration",
    "is that for parallel spins the energies of the intermediate states are lower than for antiparallel spins because of the hund s rule coupling ( for a schematic representation of the mechanism , see figure  [ s4c ] ) .",
    "the in the @xmath90 dependence of @xmath123 appears only for relatively high values of @xmath124 , for the present values of @xmath125 and @xmath120 , @xmath124 has to be larger than @xmath126 .",
    "for very low values of @xmath90 , the holes are located mainly in the @xmath103 orbitals and the superexchange mechanism involving virtual @xmath127 hoppings yields the singlet ground state .    in conclusion ,",
    "results of our calculations demonstrate that the orbital reconstruction can give rise to a weak intra - planar ferromagnetic interaction between the spins of the interfacial cu ions .",
    "note that the 3d versions of the @xmath74 hubbard model are known to exhibit ferromagnetic solutions for certain ranges of doping , in particular for 1/4 filling and 3/4 filling , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "we have shown , based on x - ray absorption spectroscopy and polarized neutron reflectometry measurements , that the antiferromagnetic exchange interaction ( af - ei ) between the interfacial cu and mn moments in ybco / lcmo multilayers can be strongly suppressed , whereas the ferromagnetic moment of the interfacial cu ions remains sizeable .",
    "this suggests that the cu moments are not induced by the af - ei with mn but are intrinsic to the interfacial cuo@xmath3 planes .",
    "we have outlined that a weakly ferromagnetic intra - planar magnetic exchange interaction between the cu moments may arise due to the nearly equal hole occupation of the cu @xmath4 and the @xmath76 orbitals that is brought about by the so - called orbital reconstruction which originates from the hybridization with the mn ions .",
    "we have furthermore suggested that the strong suppression of the af - ei between the cu and mn moments may be caused by ferromagnetic polarons which develop in poorly hole doped lcmo layers .    in terms of applications",
    ", these findings may be used to create spin - active cuprate / manganite interfaces for which the relative orientation of the cu and mn moments can be readily varied with an external magnetic field .",
    "this kind of interfacial spin control can for example allow one to induce a spin - triplet superconducting order parameter which serves as source of spin - polarized supercurrents .",

    "<S> with x - ray absorption spectroscopy and polarized neutron reflectometry we studied how the magnetic proximity effect at the interface between the cuprate high-@xmath0 superconductor @xmath1 ( ybco ) and the ferromagnet @xmath2 ( lcmo ) is related to the electronic and magnetic properties of the lcmo layers . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we explored how the magnitude of the ferromagnetic cu moment on the ybco side depends on the strength of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) exchange coupling with the mn moment on the lcmo side . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the cu moment remains sizeable if the af coupling with the mn moments is strongly reduced or even entirely suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the ferromagnetic order of the cu moments thus seems to be intrinsic to the interfacial cuo@xmath3 planes and related to a weakly ferromagnetic intra - planar exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is discussed in terms of the partial occupation of the cu @xmath4 orbitals , which occurs in the context of the so - called orbital reconstruction of the interfacial cu ions . </S>"
