    "<S> moreover , the bulk phonon wavelengths ( @xmath80 ) exceed electron wavelengths ( @xmath81 nm ) so much that the electrons do not couple to them either . </S>",
    "<S> however , sudden quench in @xmath12 may cause the electrons to jiggle around their positions causing fluctuations in exchange interactions . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in the supplemental material , these high frequency vibrations ( @xmath82 ) are integrated out during the transmission time @xmath83 .        _ </S>",
    "<S> experimental realization. _ the quantum dot - quantum wire - quantum dot system can be realized in a iii - v material such as gaas / algaas heterostructure  @xcite , using gates and quantum point contacts technique , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the quantum wire has achieved a state of wigner crystallisation  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spin initialization in the left dot and read - out in the right dot after the transfer time , can be performed using demonstrated techniques  @xcite such as singlet - triplet charge measurements by appending double - dots to both ends of the wire . however , here we show how transport measurements can also probe our mechanism by effectively detecting the transfer of a spin current . </S>",
    "<S> the prototype of this measurement consists of a left electron pump  @xcite injecting polarised electrons ( say , from a standard source  @xcite ) whereas the right pump injecting unpolarised electrons in the respective quantum dots as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . as the electrons are injected into the dots they interact with the electrons in the quantum wire as the barrier height </S>",
    "<S> is reduced and their quantum state is swapped . </S>",
    "<S> thus upon exiting the dots , the initially polarized electrons will be unpolarized and vice - versa . </S>",
    "<S> as the interaction time for spin swap is about @xmath84ns ( @xmath85ns ) for the linear ( zig - zag ) configuration the electrons must stay in the dot for such time . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the pumps have to inject current of @xmath86 depending on the configuration of electrons in the quantum wire . a spin polarization of the current carried off from the right dot by the right pump </S>",
    "<S> could then be detected by the halving of the conductance through a quantum point contact in series with the right dot .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion and conclusions. _ we have shown that entirely within the remit of gate defined structures , one can use a wigner crystal in a quantum wire for transferring spin qubits between quantum dots separated by micrometers reaching very high fidelities . </S>",
    "<S> compared to varied proposals for mediating between separated quantum dot spin qubits  @xcite , the proposed mechanism can have various advantages . </S>",
    "<S> for example , it could have higher speed making it more resilient to decoherence , simpler fabrication compared to hybrid systems , and a greater spatial extension over few electron quantum dot mediators . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , thanks to the self - assembled nature of the wigner crystal , our scheme does not require complex electronics to artificially create a regular structure of exchange coupled spins . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows the proposed protocol can operate in current dilution refrigerators , and remarkably the details of the charge configuration does not influence the performance of the system , adding additional robustness to the device fabrication . </S>",
    "<S> it also opens an avenue in spintronics by facilitating the spatial transport of a spin current without a charge current , and provides a smoking gun for the near unitary nonequilibrium dynamics in many - body solid - state systems . </S>",
    "<S> alternative realizations of wigner crystals , in liquid helium @xcite , ion traps @xcite and carbon nanotubes @xcite can also be used for implementing our mechanism .    _ </S>",
