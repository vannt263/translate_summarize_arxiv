    "photoproduction of mesons in nuclei offers the possibility to study the interaction of photons with nucleons in the nuclear medium . in the total photonuclear absorption cross section one",
    "observes experimentally for photon energies above 1 gev a reduction of the absorption strength in nuclei which is known as shadowing effect . while vector meson dominance ( vmd ) models are able to quantitatively describe this effect for photon energies above about 4 gev they usually underestimate the effect for lower photon energies ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been speculated that this may be related to a decrease of the @xmath3-meson mass in the nuclear medium .",
    "the in - medium properties of the @xmath3-meson have found widespread interest during the past decade as they may be related to chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the experimental data on dilepton production in nucleus - nucleus collisions at sps energies @xcite also seem to indicate a change of the @xmath3-meson spectral function ( lowering of the mass or broadening ) in the nuclear medium @xcite .",
    "a third experimental observation that may be related to in - medium properties of the @xmath3-meson is the disappearance of the @xmath4-resonance in the total photoabsorption cross section in nuclei at photon energies around 800 mev . in refs .  @xcite it has been proposed that this disappearance is caused by the large coupling of the @xmath5 to the @xmath6-channel and a medium modification of the spectral function of the @xmath3-meson .    while a consistent theoretical descriptions of these observations is not yet available our transport approach is a first step into this direction . during the past years",
    "we have developed a semi - classical buu transport model that allows us to calculate inclusive particle production in heavy - ion collisions from 200 amev to 200 agev , in photon , and in pion induced reactions with the very same physical input .",
    "this model has already been very successfully applied to the description of heavy - ion collisions at sis energies @xcite and photoproduction of pions and etas up to 800 mev @xcite .",
    "just recently we have given predictions for dilepton production in pion - nucleus reactions @xcite , that will be measured by the hades collaboration at gsi @xcite , and in photon - nucleus reaction in the energy range from 800 mev to 2.2 gev @xcite that is accessible at tjnaf @xcite . in these studies we have investigated direct observable consequences of medium modifications of the vector mesons through their dilepton decay .",
    "the calculation of photoproduction in the region of the nucleon resonances ( up to photon energies of about 1 gev ) has recently been extended to electroproduction @xcite . in this study",
    "we have also discussed different scenarios that might lead to a disappearance of the @xmath5 in the total photoabsorption cross section with respect to their influence on more exclusive observables .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to give predictions for pion , eta , kaon , and antikaon production in photon - nucleus reactions in the energy range from 1 to 7 gev . a comparison of these calculations with experiments that are possible at elsa and tjnaf will on the one hand help to improve our understanding of the onset of the shadowing effect . on the other hand is photoproduction an excellent tool to study medium modifications of the produced mesons since the final observables get strongly modified by the final state interaction of the primary produced particles with the nuclear medium . in photon - nucleus reactions the produced particles have in general larger momenta with respect to the nuclear environment than in heavy - ion collisions",
    "therefore , photonuclear experiments yield partly complementary information about the in - medium self energies of mesons compared to heavy - ion experiments .",
    "they also have the great advantage that they allow to study the properties of the produced hadrons in an environment that is much closer to equilibrium than in a heavy - ion collision .",
    "while the early seventies have already seen a remarkable number of experimental and theoretical studies of photoinduced particle production ( for a rather complete review see ref .",
    "@xcite ) the emphasis there was on the study of coherent production processes .",
    "incoherent production had to rely for an interpretation on the glauber approximation that involves a number of approximations and restrictions .",
    "the study described here is free of most of these and thus provides a more reliable framework for an interpretations of such reactions .",
    "unfortunately , the few existing experimental data in refs .",
    "@xcite on incoherent photoproduction of mesons in nuclei were all obtained under very restrictive experimental conditions which , furthermore , can not be reconstructed from the literature .",
    "we can , therefore , not compare our results to any data .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : buu ] we describe briefly the buu transport model . in section  [ sec : ele ] we discuss our treatment of elementary photon - nucleon collisions and , in particular , the implementation of the shadowing effect .",
    "our results for photoproduction of pions , etas , kaons , and antikaons are presented in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we close with a summary in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "we use a semi - classical transport model ( buu ) for a description of the final state interactions ( fsi ) of the produced particles .",
    "this description allows a full coupled channel treatment of the fsi , including non - forward processes .",

    "[ sn_pb_2_7 ] we show the shadowing factor @xmath92 for @xmath2pb at photon energies of 2 and 7 gev . at 2 gev",
    "there are some interference structures but since @xmath95 varies only between 0.8 and 1.2 the influence of shadowing on our calculations for particle production is very small . at 7 gev shadowing",
    "is much more important .",

    "the same shadowing factor @xmath92 is used for all partial cross sections , so that , for example , the primary in - medium cross section @xmath96 for photoproduction of a meson m in @xmath97 is related to the vacuum cross section @xmath98 via : @xmath99 the final state interactions are then treated in the transporttheoretical framework described in section  [ sec : buu ] .",
    "the initial state interactions of the incoming photon are thus described in a model that contains quantum - mechanical coherence effects whereas the final state interactions are treated in a completely incoherent way .",
    "in fig .  [ fig8 ]",
    "we present the results of our calculations for the total @xmath100 production cross section in @xmath1c ( upper part ) and @xmath2pb ( lower part ) .",
    "the solid lines display our standard calculations .",
    "one sees that the cross section per nucleon is larger for @xmath1c because nuclear shadowing and final state interaction are less effective . for @xmath1c",
    "there is also a local maximum around 2 gev in the excitation function that is not present in @xmath2pb .",
    "this maximum is mainly caused by an interplay of the rising @xmath64-production cross section and the onset of shadowing . for @xmath2pb",
    "the decrease between 2 and 3 gev due to shadowing is neutralized by secondary collisions of the primary produced particles that contribute to the total yield .",
    "for the dashed lines we used a two - body absorption for the @xmath101-resonance only instead of the absorption introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite that gives an enhanced @xmath102-absorption . with increasing photon energy",
    "the treatment of the @xmath102-absorption becomes less important . for @xmath1c",
    "the improved , new treatment reduces the pion yield by about 5% , for @xmath2pb by about 20% .",
    "the use of a string fragmentation model in hadronic transport models always requires the introduction of a finite formation time. in our calculations we use @xmath103 fm / c ( in the rest frame of the produced particles ) which leads to a good reproduction of experimental data on pion production in heavy - ion collisions at sps energies .",
    "while this value lies in a reasonable range our formation time prescription is nonetheless questionable as we neglect any interaction of the strings during their formation with the surrounding nuclear medium . from a practical point of view",
    "this prescription should thus be regarded as a parameterization of our ignorance with respect to the role of partonic degrees of freedom . in order to explore the resulting uncertainties we have also performed calculations with @xmath104 ( dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) .",
    "this enhances the final state interactions of the produced particles . here",
    "one should note that by the final state interactions the particle yield is not only reduced but can also be enhanced when a primarily produced particle with high energy strikes another nucleon , as e.g. in @xmath105 . from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] one sees that the formation time becomes more important with increasing photon energy . for @xmath1c the calculation with zero formation time gives an enhancement of the pion yield at 7 gev by about 15% .",
    "this enhancement is less pronounced in @xmath2pb because the absorption of the secondary produced particles is more effective .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we also show results of calculations without shadowing for the incoming photon ( dash - dotted lines ) . because of the coordinate dependence of the shadowing factor the effect of shadowing is in principle not simply proportional to the effect seen in the total absorption cross section . however , the deviations from this proportionality are quite small as one sees by comparing the results in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] to the effective mass numbers in figs .",
    "[ shad_12c ] and [ shad_208pb ] .",
    "the effect of the final state interaction of the produced particles is , as expected , rather different for @xmath1c and @xmath2pb . in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] calculations without final state interaction are displayed by the dot - dot - dashed lines .",
    "now there are only two competing mechanisms that influence the shape of these excitation functions . on the one hand",
    "the particle yield in elementary photon - nucloen collisions increases with photon energy . on the other hand",
    "the shadowing effect becomes also more important for higher energies . in the case of @xmath2pb",
    "the shadowing effect dominates and the cross section decreases monotonously with increasing photon energy . for @xmath1c",
    "there is first a decrease of the pion yield up to a photon energy of 3 gev and then an increase because shadowing is here less important than for @xmath2pb .    in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show the effects of the same scenarios on @xmath65 photoproduction .",
    "first one observes a strong increase of the total cross section from 1 to 3 gev by about a factor of 4 which is simply due to the opening of phase space .",
    "the effect of the formation time is again determined by an interplay between secondary production and absorption which results in a very small net effect .",
    "the shadowing effect is , as expected , very similar to the case of pion production . for @xmath1c the calculation without final state interaction",
    "gives practically the same result as the standard calculation .",
    "this is quite different for @xmath2pb where the final state interaction reduces the yield , in particular for low photon energies , significantly .",
    "since the total meson production yield is , as discussed above , determined by different effects that partly cancel each other it is instructive to look at more exclusive observables . in figs .",
    "[ fig92 ] and [ fig91 ] we therefore present momentum differential cross sections for the production of pions ( upper part ) and etas ( lower part ) at photon energies of 2 and 4 gev in @xmath2pb . here",
    "we show our standard calculations ( solid lines ) as well as calculations without formation time ( i.e. maximum final state interaction ) ( dashed lines ) and without final state interaction ( dotted lines ) . in the pion case the spectrum is getting softer with increasing final state interactions .    the @xmath65-spectra show a pronounced structure at high momenta that is caused from exclusive processes @xmath106 that are strongly forward peaked . in @xmath100 production",
    "such a structure is not present because the string fragmentation model used here does not include flavor exchange mechanisms .",
    "we leave the inclusion of such processes for future work .",
    "the influence of the final state interaction on the @xmath65-spectrum is similar to the pion case : the final state interactions mainly shift the spectrum to lower energies .    in figs .",
    "[ c_rho ] and [ pb_rho ] we present the results of our calculations for the @xmath107 invariant mass spectra at photon energies of 2 , 4 , and 6 gev in @xmath1c and @xmath2pb , respectively .",
    "we show at each case the total mass differential cross section as well as the contribution coming from @xmath78 decays .",
    "the effect of the final state interaction is , as expected , much larger for @xmath2pb than for @xmath1c . while the peak of the @xmath3 meson clearly dominates the spectrum in @xmath1c it is , especially for low photon energies , harder to identify in @xmath2pb .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the observable effects of medium modifications of the vector mesons @xmath3 and @xmath66 through their @xmath108 decay in photoproduction at energies between 0.8 and 2.2 gev . in this study we have found an enhancement of the yield of intermediate mass ( @xmath109 mev ) dileptons by about a factor 3 when the mass of the @xmath3 meson was reduced in the nuclear medium according to the predictions of refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath110 where @xmath111 denotes the pole mass of the @xmath3 meson . in figs .",
    "[ c_rho ] and [ pb_rho ] the dashed lines show the calculations with such a dropping mass scenario .",
    "one sees that the @xmath107 spectrum is hardly influenced by such a medium modification .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that the pions have a very short mean free path in the nuclear medium ( @xmath112 fm ) .",
    "therefore the probability that two pions which stem from a decay of a @xmath3 meson at a relevant density are both able to propagate to the vacuum without rescattering is very low .      in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we present our results for @xmath113-production in @xmath1c and @xmath2pb .",
    "we again show , like for pion and eta production , the results of different model calculations : a standard calculation ( solid lines ) that includes all effects , a calculation with zero formation time ( dashed lines ) , without shadowing ( dotted lines ) , and without final state interaction ( dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "the primary produced @xmath114-quarks can not be annihilated in the nuclear medium and all of them are finally contained in @xmath113 and @xmath115 mesons . therefore the final state interaction can only enhance the @xmath113 yield . from fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] one sees that for @xmath1c the number of secondary produced @xmath113-mesons is almost negligible while for @xmath2pb they amount to about 30% of the total yield . in a calculation with zero formation time the cross section for @xmath113 production is enhanced for large photon energies in @xmath1c by about 20% and in @xmath2pb by about 40% .",
    "this enhancement is mainly caused by collisions of primary high energy pions with nucleons .",
    "such pions have a large formation time @xmath116 in the lab system , where @xmath117 is a lorentz factor , which suppresses secondary interactions .",
    "the shadowing effect is very similar to the one for pion or eta production .",
    "the fact that the calculations without shadowing and zero formation time are practically identical for both nuclei is accidental .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we show our results for @xmath118-production .",
    "in contrast to @xmath113-production primary @xmath118-mesons can be absorbed via processes @xmath119 . for @xmath1c absorption and secondary production",
    "nearly cancel each other as can be seen by comparing the standard calculation ( solid line ) and the calculation without final state interaction ( dash - dotted line ) .",
    "the calcultion with zero formation time gives a slightly larger result . in @xmath2pb",
    "the absorption mechanism is a little more dominant .",
    "therfore , the calculation without final state interaction gives the largest result .    by comparing the total @xmath113- and @xmath118-production in figs .",
    "[ fig10 ] and [ fig11 ] one sees that in our calculation almost as many antikaons as kaons are produced .",
    "this is due to the fact that the string fragmentation model produces much more antikaons than hyperons in a @xmath78-nucleon collision which might be an artifact of the model .",
    "however , since there are presently no experimental data for inclusive antikaon production in photon - nucleon collisions available it is difficult to check this point .",
    "therefore we stress here that our results for photoproduction in nuclei are only valid under the caveat that our description of the elementary photon - nucleon collision is correct .    in figs .",
    "[ fig112 ] and [ fig111 ] we show momentum differential cross sections for production of @xmath113- and @xmath118-mesons in @xmath2pb at photon energies of 2 and 4 gev .",

    "sees that the final state interactions primarily enhance the low momentum yield . for the @xmath118-mesons",
    "the high momentum tail is significantly reduced by the final state interactions",
    ". a comparison of these spectra to future experimental data will therefore be helpful with respect to our understanding of the interactions of kaons with nucleons in the nuclear medium .",
    "we have presented a calculation of photoproduction of pions , etas , kaons , and antikaons in the energy range from 1 to 7 gev in @xmath1c and @xmath2pb within a model that contains shadowing of the incoming photon and treats the outgoing particles in a coupled channel semi - classical buu transport model .",
    "it thus goes beyond the standard glauber treatment because it can describe all possible chains that can lead to the final state under investigation .",
    "predictions for total cross sections as well as momentum differential cross sections were given .",
    "we have investigated in detail the influence of shadowing for the incoming photon and final state interaction of the produced particles on our results .",
    "a comparison of experimental data to our results will clarify if our treatment of the in - medium meson - nucleon interactions is correct .",
    "in particular , we have shown that @xmath107 invariant mass spectra exhibit only a very small sensitivity on medium modifications of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "our calculations of photoproduction of mesons in nuclei are based on the input of photoproduction of mesons on nucleons for which so far only few experimental data in the relevant energy range exist .",
    "new experimental data are urgently needed in order to remove uncertainties coming from the treatment of the elementary process .",
    "there are also uncertainties coming from our description of the hadronic interactions because not all channels have yet experimentally been measured or are in principal unmeasurable .",
    "however , we do not expect these uncertainties to have a large influence on the results reported here since we have calculated rather inclusive observables for which the total employed cross sections are most decisive .    in assessing the overall reliability of the predictions made here we point out that the method ( and code ) used here has been shown to provide a very good description of @xmath64 , @xmath120 and @xmath65 photoproduction data in the mami energy regime ( up to 800 mev ) @xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that the method also describes shadowing very well up to photon energies of a few gev .",
    "the same method also gives an excellent description of meson production in heavy - ion collisions in the gev regime , typically describing these data within a factor @xmath121 . in these latter reactions",
    "the same final state interactions take place as in the present calculation . thus , both the initial state ( shadowing ) and the final state interactions with their complex coupled channel effects are well under control .",
    "we thus feel confident that the accuracy of the present calculations is as good as that observed in the other reaction channels .",
    "finally , we wish to mention that the calculations reported here can be extended to the case of electroproduction @xcite .",
    "the elastic cross section @xmath122 is parameterized for invariant energies below the string threshold @xmath123 gev by the following expression : @xmath124 where @xmath125 denotes the kaon momentum in the rest frame of the nucleon and we use : @xmath126 mb , @xmath127 mb / gev , @xmath128 mb / gev@xmath129 , @xmath130/gev , @xmath131/gev@xmath129 . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( upper part ) we show that this gives a good description of the experimental data",
    ". for scattering on a neutron there exist in the relevant energy range only a few experimental data for the charge exchange process @xmath132 @xcite and no data for the process @xmath133 .",
    "therefore , we assume on the neutron the same total elastic cross section ( including charge exchange ) : @xmath134 this is a rather crude approximation which is also not in line with the experimental data for @xmath132 at low momenta @xcite . however , for the calculations presented here this is not essential since all these cross sections are small and , in particular , for low momenta they play only a small role for the phase space distributions of the particles involved .",
    "the inelastic kaon - nucleon cross section is obtained by a spline interpolation through selected data points of the total cross section after subtraction of the elastic contribution .",
    "the resulting cross sections are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( middle part for @xmath135 , lower part for @xmath136 ) .",
    "we assume the inelastic cross section to consist only of @xmath137 states which is a good approximation since these cross sections are only used for invariant collision energies below 2.2 gev .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath115 scattering on nucleons follow from isospin symmetry : @xmath138    in case of antikaon scattering on nucleons we first get contributions to the cross sections from the @xmath36 resonances listed above which we treat analogous to pion - nucleon scattering @xcite as incoherent breit - wigner type contributions . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one sees that these contributions alone  unlike the case of pion - nucleon  do not suffice to describe the cross sections for the different channels .",
    "therefore we have introduced a non - resonant background cross section of the following form for the different channels @xmath139 in @xmath140 scattering : @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath143 denote the cms momenta of the initial and final particles , respectively and @xmath144 is the total cms energy .",

    "for @xmath146 this parameterization is only used for invariant energies below 1.7 gev . for larger energies we use a spline interpolation through selected experimental data points because the broad bump in the experimental data around 1.8 gev can hardly be described by a simple fit function . from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] one sees that our parameterizations give a good description of the experimental data for @xmath147 .    in order to describe the total @xmath140 cross section in the relevant energy range",

    "the experimental data are described rather well up to a photon energy of 4 gev , but for larger energies the experimental cross section is overestimated by about 50% . the experimental data seem to indicate a saturation of the cross section already at 4 gev which is hard to explain .",
    "therefore we use the described cross sections keeping in mind that out treatment of the elementary photon - nucleon reaction might need to be refined when new and more reliable experimental data will become available .",
