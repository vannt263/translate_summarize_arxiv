    "new spin - dependent interactions of nature with very weak couplings to matter and ranges of mesoscopic  scale ( millimeters to nanometers ) are poorly constrained by experiment and are attracting more theoretical attention@xcite .",
    "particles which might transmit such interactions are starting to be referred to as wisps ( weakly - interacting sub - ev particles )  @xcite .",
    "symmetries broken at a high energy scale generically lead to weakly - coupled light particles with long - range interactions through goldstone s theorem .",
    "theoretical attempts to explain dark matter and dark energy can also produce new weakly - coupled long - range interactions . in both cases",
    "there are many examples in which the new interactions are spin - dependent .",
    "the fact that the dark energy density of order ( 1 mev)@xmath6 corresponds to a @xmath7 @xmath8 m length scale by dimensional analysis also encourages searches for new phenomena around this scale  @xcite . taken together , these developments suggest that it is reasonable to conduct experimental searches for possible new spin - dependent interactions which act over mesoscopic distance scales .",
    "many searches for new spin - dependent interactions have been motivated by the idea of axions  @xcite , which can induce a @xmath9-odd and @xmath10-odd interaction between polarized and unpolarized particles proportional to @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the distance between the particles and @xmath13 is the spin of the polarized particle .",
    "several other ideas can generate exotic spin - dependent interactions  @xcite .",
    "however the idea to search for new spin - dependent interactions can be considered within a more general theoretical context .",
    "dobrescu and mocioiu  @xcite recently performed a general classification of interactions between nonrelativistic spin @xmath14 fermions assuming only rotational invariance .",
    "this analysis emphasized the rich variety of possibilities for new spin - dependent interactions .",
    "of the 16 different terms in the elastic scattering amplitude uncovered in this analysis , 15 involve either one or both of the spins of the fermions .    in this paper",
    "we will consider constraints on possible new spin - dependent , velocity - independent forces between nucleons .",
    "for one boson exchange between two nonrelativistic spin @xmath14 fermions there are 9 types of potentials involving both spins .",
    "six depend on the relative velocities of the particles and the remaining three ( @xmath15 , and @xmath16 in the notation of dobrescu and mocioiu ) are velocity - independent :    @xmath17    @xmath18    and @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the mass , @xmath21 is the spin of the polarized particle , @xmath22 is planck constant , @xmath23 is the interaction range , and @xmath24 is the unit vector between the particles .",
    "the existing constraints on new spin - spin interactions between nucleons at distance scales below 1 cm are generally rather poor .",
    "it is not hard to understand why : for shorter - range interactions both the number of particles that can be brought within the range of the interaction becomes smaller and smaller , and the required precision with which one can understand the large backgrounds from the electromagnetic fields that accompany any macroscopically polarized medium becomes more and more difficult to achieve .",
    "several measurements  @xcite constrain @xmath25 and @xmath26 at relatively large distances .",
    "the best constraints at atomic distance scales come from the work of ramsey  @xcite who used spectroscopy in molecular hydrogen to constrain @xmath25 and @xmath26 interactions between protons .",
    "recently kimball and coauthors  @xcite have used measurements  @xcite and calculations  @xcite of cross sections for spin exchange collisions between @xmath0he and na atoms to constrain @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 between neutrons and protons .",
    "@xmath27 is a spin - dependent and velocity - dependent potential of the form    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is the relative velocity of the particles ( such a potential can also influence atomic spin exchange collisions ) . in atomic spin exchange collisions",
    "the spin - dependent part of the interaction is a small perturbation on the dominant spin - independent atom - atom potential , and theoretical calculations of the spin - exchange cross section can be performed with high accuracy given sufficiently precise data on atomic potentials .",
    "the theoretical calculations are simpler for systems involving light atoms , and experimental data on spin exchange cross sections exist under conditions dominated by fast binary atom - atom collisions which minimize possible contributions from three - body collisions and the spin - rotation interaction  @xcite . in combination with existing constraints from spectroscopy in molecular hydrogen  @xcite mentioned above , these authors were also able to set indirect constraints for new interactions between neutrons .",
    "measurements on ensembles of polarized @xmath0he gas atoms have been used in several recent studies which constrain monopole - dipole interactions@xcite , which involve the spin of one of the two particles . in this paper",
    "we show that polarized @xmath0he can also be used to improve existing constraints on possible new nucleon spin - dependent interactions involving the spins of both particles .",
    "the @xmath0he nucleus is isolated enough from external influences by the inert closed electron shell that other weak interactions involving the spin of the nucleus can manifest themselves .",
    "the interactions between the @xmath0he atoms in a gas at room temperature are dominated by binary atomic collisions whose dynamics have been accurately calculated using the well - measured he - he atomic potential , and the extra effects from weak spin - dependent interactions can be treated to high accuracy as weak perturbations . unlike the spin exchange collisions between noble gas atoms and alkali metal atoms , there is no contribution from polarized electrons .",
    "experimental measurement coupled with theoretical analysis shows that the polarization of the @xmath0he nucleus is dominated as one would expect by the polarization of the neutron  @xcite , and therefore any limit derived from this system can be attributed directly to a limit on neutron - neutron interactions .",
    "the spin exchange cross section between @xmath0he atoms can be calculated with relatively high accuracy using the well - measured atomic potentials since ( as for na-@xmath2he ) the spin - dependent part of @xmath2he-@xmath2he scattering is also a small perturbation on the dominant spin - independent part .",
    "the spin relaxation rate @xmath30 is simply related to the @xmath2he-@xmath2he spin - exchange cross section @xmath31@xcite    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the boltzmann",
    "constant , @xmath34 is the energy of the particles , @xmath8 is the reduced mass , @xmath10 is the temperature , and @xmath35 is the gas density . furthermore , there is extensive data on the longitudinal spin relaxation rate @xmath1 of ensembles of polarized @xmath0he gas atoms under conditions in which this rate is dominated by binary @xmath0he-@xmath0he spin exchange collisions . by using special glass cells to suppress the loss of polarization from interaction with the container walls , the measured spin relaxation rate of polarized @xmath0he gas in certain cells is so slow ( relaxation times on the order of several hundred hours ) that the measured rate closely approaches the rate calculated from magnetic dipole - dipole interactions .",
    "since the events which lead to the @xmath1 relaxation rate come from a large number of binary atom - atom collisions between many pairs of polarized atoms , @xmath1 measurements have the potential to be more sensitive to new interactions than measurements of spin exchange cross sections , which involve single binary collisions between atoms .    in this work",
    ", we compare the measured longitudinal spin relaxation rates @xmath1 of polarized @xmath2he gas with theoretical calculations of @xmath1 from magnetic dipole - dipole interactions to set a limit for possible new spin - spin couplings between neutrons .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we discuss the physical mechanisms which can lead to @xmath1 spin relaxation in an ensemble of polarized gas atoms and argue that the dominant contributions for the data considered in this paper come from spin exchange collisions and interactions of the polarized atoms with the cell walls .",
    "we also outline the calculation of the contribution to @xmath1 from the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the spin dependent potential @xmath26 described above is directly proportional to the magnetic dipole - dipole interaction in the @xmath36 limit .",
    "we observe that there is a distance scale beyond which the difference between the radial dependence of the matrix elements involved in the calculation of the spin exchange cross section for the two interactions is negligible . in sec .",
    "iii we present experimental data on @xmath1 spin relaxation rates and use this data to set limits on the pseudoscalar coupling @xmath37 which generate the @xmath26 potential and on possible contributions from gravitational torsion between neutrons .",
    "iv has our conclusions and suggestions for further work .",
    "interactions which can cause longitudinal spin relaxation in an ensemble of polarized @xmath0he atoms include : ( 1 ) a possible electric dipole moment , ( 2 ) the spin - rotation interaction in @xmath0he-@xmath0he collisions , ( 3 ) wall relaxation(@xmath38 ) , ( 4 ) magnetic field gradients(@xmath39 ) , ( 5 ) magnetic dipole - dipole interactions(@xmath40 ) , and ( 6 ) a new dipole - dipole interaction(@xmath41 ) .",
    "the experimental upper bounds on atomic electric dipole moments in general and on @xmath0he in particular make mechanism ( 1 ) utterly negligible  @xcite and we shall not consider it further .    the spin - rotation interaction ( mechanism 2 above ) is proportional to @xmath42 with @xmath43 the orbital angular momentum coming from the motional magnetic fields seen by the polarized nucleus during atomic collisions  @xcite .",
    "the interatomic interaction distorts the charge distribution of the atom and creates a fluctuating field . at room temperature the average kinetic energy of the colliding @xmath2he atoms",
    "is small compared to the atomic binding energy and therefore these distortions are relatively small . in addition , the @xmath0he-@xmath0he interaction is weak enough that there are no molecular bound states which can allow the atoms to experience several revolutions and amplify the spin - rotation interaction , as happens for other atomic species .",
    "this effect has been investigated  @xcite for @xmath0he and is negligible ( < 1% ) compared with magnetic dipole - dipole interaction at room temperature .",
    "the longitudinal relaxation rate @xmath38 due to atomic collisions with the cell wall is significant .",
    "the detailed physics involved in the wall relaxation remains poorly understood .",
    "nevertheless careful preparation of the surfaces of certain types of aluminosilicate glasses can reduce the relaxation rate from this process to be small compared to dipole - dipole relaxation , as will be shown in section  iii .",
    "spin relaxation @xmath39 from the motion of the polarized nuclei in magnetic field gradients can be calculated to be@xcite @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the diffusion constant of the polarized gas and @xmath46 are the magnetic fields parallel ( perpendicular ) to the spin s direction . for a polarized @xmath2he cell of pressure 1 bar at room temperature in an external field gradient of @xmath47 @xmath48 , which is typically achieved in the helmholtz coil arrangements used in the measurements described in section iii , @xmath49  s@xmath50@xcite , which is small compared to the dipole - dipole relaxation in the cells discussed in section iii .",
    "internal field gradients induced by the magnetization of the polarized gas are proportional to the gas density and polarization and also depend on the geometry of the gas container .",
    "a field generated by polarized gas in a spherical cell is uniform and thus has no effect on spin relaxation . for the gas cells discussed in this paper",
    "the relaxation from self - generated internal field gradients is very small compared to relaxation from external field gradients .",

    "<S> new particles with masses in the sub - ev range have been predicted by various theories beyond the standard model . some can induce new spin - spin interactions between fermions . </S>",
    "<S> existing constraints on such interactions between nucleons with mesoscopic ranges ( millimeters to nanometers ) are quite poor . </S>",
    "<S> polarized @xmath0he gas is an especially clean system to use to constrain these possible new spin - spin interactions because the spin - independent atomic potential between helium atoms is well - characterized experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the small effects from binary atomic collisions in a polarized gas from magnetic dipole - dipole and other possible weak spin - spin interactions which lead to spin relaxation can be calculated perturbatively . </S>",
    "<S> we compare existing measurements of the longitudinal spin relaxation rate @xmath1 of polarized @xmath2he gas with theoretical calculations and set a @xmath3 upper bound on the pseudoscalar coupling strength @xmath4 for possible new neutron - neutron dipole - dipole interactions of @xmath5 for distances larger than 100 nm . </S>",
    "<S> we also set new direct limits on possible gravitational torsion interactions between neutrons . </S>"
