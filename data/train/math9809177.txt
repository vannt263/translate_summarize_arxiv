    "ninety - five years ago william burnside asked whether every finitely generated group of finite exponent must be finite @xcite . since then , significant progress has been made in the study of the free burnside groups , much of it coming in recent years . in this first section the recent history of their study",
    "will be briefly reviewed so that the results announced below can be viewed in their proper context .",
    "the second section introduces many of the concepts from which the general theory is constructed .",
    "the third and the fourth sections will describe the results of general small cancellation theory and the results on the burnside groups in greater detail .",
    "the existence of exponents for which burnside s conjecture is false was first demonstrated by novikov and adian in a series of articles published in 1968  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath1 and odd , they proved that the free burnside group of exponent @xmath2 is infinite , that these groups have decidable word problems , and that their only finite subgroups are cyclic . in a book - length reworking of the results @xcite , adian was able to extend coverage of the proof to include all cases with @xmath3 and odd .",
    "both versions of the proof are several hundred pages in length .    in 1982 , a.  yu .  olshanskii published an alternative proof that the burnside groups of exponent @xmath4 and odd are infinite , that they have a decidable word problem , and that their only finite subgroups are cyclic @xcite . olshanskii used small cancellation theory and especially van kampen diagrams to create a significantly shorter proof of adian and novikov s results . by introducing more geometry ,",
    "the proof was reduced to a mere thirty - page article .    in 1994 , s. v. ivanov published a substantial article on the burnside groups in which he showed that when @xmath2 is at least @xmath5 and either odd or divisible by @xmath6 , then the free burnside group of exponent @xmath2 is infinite  @xcite .",
    "in addition , he showed that these groups have a decidable word problem and he effectively described their finite subgroups . since every burnside group with exponent at least @xmath7 has one of these groups as a homomorphic image , ivanov s proof shows that burnside s original conjecture can be answered in the negative for almost all exponents @xmath2 .",
    "finally , in 1996 i.  lysionok published a proof that the burnside groups of exponent @xmath8 are infinite @xcite .",
    "combined with the earlier proofs regarding burnside groups of large odd exponent , this work also shows that almost all of the burnside groups are infinite .",
    "as can be seen from the above review , the study of an arbitrary burnside group of large exponent has proceeded indirectly through the study of the homomorphic images onto burnside groups whose exponent is either large and odd or divisible by a large power of 2 .",
    "in particular , the restriction that @xmath2 be either large and odd or divisible by a large power of 2 has always been needed to show the decidability of the word problem , the structure of the finite subgroups , and other detailed structural information .",
    "the results described below remove these restrictions .",
    "the author is currently in the process of publishing and preparing to publish a pair of articles which first develop a general version of small cancellation theory applicable in higher dimensions ( @xcite ) , and then apply this theory to the burnside groups of sufficiently large exponent ( @xcite ) . in combination",
    "these articles prove that the free burnside groups of exponent @xmath0 are infinite groups which have a decidable word problem .",
    "the structure of the finite subgroups of these groups is calculated from the automorphism groups of the general relators used in the presentation .",
    "the present article gives a brief introduction to the methods and techniques involved in the proof .",
    "the definition of a general relator , the axioms of general small cancellation theory , and a description of the inductive construction involved for the burnside groups are included . many of the ideas involved originate with the recent work of a.  yu .",
    "olshanskii and s.  v.  ivanov .",
    "some familiarity with their work on the burnside problem will be assumed .",
    "the theory developed by the author in @xcite is a generalized version of small cancellation theory which is applicable to specific types of high - dimensional simplicial complexes .",
    "the usual results on small cancellation groups are shown to hold in this new setting with only slight modifications .",
    "the major results of this theory are summarized below in theorem  [ mainthm1 ] .",
    "the definitions of the unfamiliar terms will be given later in the article .",
    "[ mainthm1 ]    if @xmath9 is a general small cancellation presentation with @xmath10 , then the word and conjugacy problems for @xmath11 are decidable , the cayley graph is constructible , the cayley category of the presentation is contractible , and @xmath11 is the direct limit of hyperbolic groups .",
    "if the presentation satisfies a few additional hypotheses , then every finite subgroup of @xmath11 is a subgroup of the automorphism group of some general relator in @xmath12 .",
    "the generalized small cancellation theory developed in @xcite overlaps significantly with the general theories developed by rips ( @xcite ) and olshanskii ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the theory described below attempts to provide an underlying geometric object whose existence explains the success of these earlier constructions .",
    "the main results on the burnside groups which are proved in @xcite are summarized below in theorem  [ mainthm2 ] .",
    "the notation @xmath13 refers to the @xmath14-generated free burnside group of exponent @xmath2 .",
    "[ mainthm2 ]    for any @xmath15 , and any @xmath0 , the burnside group @xmath13 possesses a general small cancellation presentation which satisfies all of the hypotheses and conclusions of theorem  [ mainthm1 ] . in addition , every finite subgroup of the group @xmath13 is contained in a direct product of a dihedral of order @xmath16 with a finite number of dihedral @xmath17-groups whose exponent divides @xmath2 . as a consequence , all of the groups @xmath13 are infinite .",
    "the approach used in these articles has succeeded in significantly lowering the previous bounds beyond which all of the burnside groups are known to be infinite , and also in proving for the first time that the word problem for all burnside groups of sufficiently large exponent is decidable .",
    "finally , in contrast with earlier work on the burnside groups , no distinction is made between burnside groups with even or odd exponents .",
    "the generalization of small cancellation theory alluded to above will depend on an expansion of the usual definition of a relator . to help motivate the revised definition",
    ", we will begin with a few familiar examples , followed by the technical definitions .",
    "the following examples are groups with familiar presentations and well - known properties which can be subsumed under the rubric of general small cancellation theory .",
    "the explanation of the exact definitions will be postponed until after the examples have been described .",
    "[ exam - modular ]    * [ the modular group ] * let    @xmath18    then @xmath19 .",
    "the modular group @xmath20 is the free product of the cyclic groups of order 2 and 3 which are generated by @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in particular , @xmath23 is generated by @xmath21 and @xmath24 , and it has the following presentation :    @xmath25    this particular presentation does not satisfy any of the usual small cancellation conditions such as @xmath26 or @xmath27 since the letter @xmath21 is a piece and it represents one - half of the boundary of the first relator .",
    "the general small cancellation theory under discussion would replace this presentation with a ` general presentation ' which still has @xmath21 and @xmath24 as generators , but the relators will be altered to appear as in figure  [ fig - modular ] .       [ exam - dihedrals ]    * [ dihedral groups ] * consider the standard presentation of the dihedral group of order @xmath16 :    @xmath28    this presentation also has a modification which satisfies some general small cancellation conditions . the resulting general relators are given in figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] moreover , it is easy to show that no presentation of a dihedral is ever a small cancellation presentation in the traditional sense , since one of the results of the traditional theory is that all of the finite subgroups of a small cancellation group are cyclic .",
    "[ exam - coxeter ]    * [ coxeter groups ] * coxeter groups can be seen as a generalization of example  [ exam - dihedrals ] .",
    "let @xmath29 be a symmetric @xmath30 matrix whose entries lie in the set @xmath31 .",
    "assume in addition that @xmath32 and @xmath33 for all @xmath34 .",
    "the coxeter group based on @xmath29 is given by the presentation    @xmath35    where no relation is added in the case @xmath36 .",
    "if @xmath37 is never equal to 2 , then the coxeter group is said to be of large type .",
    "if @xmath37 is never equal to 2 or 3 , then the coxeter group is said to be of extra - large type .",
    "once the relators @xmath38 are modified as in example  [ exam - dihedrals ] , the resulting coxeter group satisfies a version of @xmath39 , a coxeter group of large type satisfies a version of @xmath26 , and a coxeter group of extra - large type satisfies a version of @xmath40 .",
    "the most important concept involved in general small cancellation theory is that of a general relator .",
    "every general relator will be assigned a height .",
    "traditional relators are examples of height 2 .",
    "the examples given in the previous section are general relators of height 3 .",
    "before the precise technical definition is given , the examples from the previous section will be discussed in greater detail , and we will present a single example of a general relator of height 4 .",
    "[ def - boundary ]    * [ boundaries of general relators ] * in the same way that a relator in the traditional sense is often viewed as a labeled disk rather than a labeled circle , the structures shown in figure  [ fig - modular ] and figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] are , technically speaking , merely the boundaries of general relators and not the general relators themselves",
    ". a general relator will be the topological cone over its roughly circular boundary .",
    "thus , the general relator corresponding to @xmath41 ( whose boundary is shown in figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] ) will be composed of eight solid circular cones which are adjoined along their lateral sides .",
    "this particular general relator is shown schematically in figure  [ fig - solid ] .",
    "similarly the general relator corresponding to @xmath42 ( whose boundary is shown in figure  [ fig - modular ] ) will consist of three triangles and three solid circular cones .",
    "[ def - height ]    * [ heights ] * in a traditional relator , the vertices , the open edges and the interior of the disk can be thought of as being represented by their barycenters .",
    "moreover , these barycenters can be assigned heights based on whether they come from a vertex ( height 0 ) , an edge ( height 1 ) , or a disk ( height 2 ) . in a similar way",
    ", the apex of the cone over the dihedral structure in figure  [ fig - solid ] can be assigned a height of 3 since it contains a disk of height 2 in its boundary .",
    "once these barycenters have been assigned heights , there is a notion of a 1- , 2- , and 3-skeleton which is the union of all of the pieces assigned a height of at most 1 , at most 2 , or at most 3 .",
    "the rightmost picture in figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] is thus the 2-skeleton of the general relator , as well as its boundary .",
    "[ exam - higherheight ]    * [ a general relator of height 4 ] * the following explicit example will be used to illustrate several key concepts which are precisely defined below .",
    "let @xmath43 .",
    "a modification of this presentation which uses general relators begins with the three ( general ) relators whose boundaries are shown in figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] .",
    "the fourth relator , @xmath44 , is modified as shown in figure  [ fig - highrank ] .",
    "it is obtained from the cycle labeled @xmath44 by attaching the general relator for @xmath41 to each of the paths labeled @xmath45 .",
    "the top figure shows the 2-skeleton of this relator , while the bottom figure shows its 3-skeleton .",
    "as described above , the general relator itself will be the topological cone over this roughly circular boundary , and the apex of the cone will be assigned a height of 4 since it contains a point of height 3 in its boundary .",
    "examples of general relators of higher height can be obtained as follows : given a general relator @xmath46 of height @xmath47 , introduce a new generator @xmath48 and attach an arrow labeled @xmath48 to any two distinct vertices in @xmath46 .",
    "the resulting structure qualifies as the boundary of a general relator , and since it contains @xmath46 in its boundary it has height @xmath49 .",
    "variations on this theme can create presentations which contain general relators of arbitrary height .    as can be seen from these examples , a general relator is no longer simply a word or a cycle , but rather a particular type of simplicial complex with a labeling on its 1-skeleton .",
    "the detailed structure of a general relator is best captured by the partially ordered set of its barycenters . in each of the examples given so far",
    "we can associate a partially ordered set to each general relator .",
    "the elements are the barycenters , and the ordering is defined by setting @xmath50 if and only if @xmath51 is contained in the boundary of @xmath52 .",
    "perhaps more surprising , this partially ordered set , or poset , contains all of the information needed to reconstruct the complex .",
    "( the procedure for creating a simplicial complex from a poset is due to d. quillen @xcite ) . for an arbitrary",
    "partially ordered set the corresponding simplicial complex is derived by taking the finite chains as the simplices . for a traditional relator ,",
    "the poset has only 3 levels : the vertices are the elements of height 0 , the open edges are the elements of height 1 , and the single open 2-cell is the unique element of height 2 .",
    "the simplicial complex corresponding to this poset is a simplicial subdivision of the original 2-cell .",
    "the @xmath47-skeleton of such a poset will refer to the geometric realization of the sub - poset consisting only of those elements of height @xmath47 or less .",
    "thus in the traditional case , the 1-skeleton is the cyclic boundary and the 0-skeleton consists of the vertices alone . for the general relator shown in figure  [ fig - highrank ]",
    ", the poset has one element of height 4 , two elements of height 3 , sixteen elements of height 2 , and sixteen elements of height 1 .",
    "we will now precisely define a general relator using these partially ordered sets .",
    "[ def - relators ]    * [ general relators ] * a general relator @xmath46 is ( the simplicial complex corresponding to ) a finite poset with a unique maximum element subject to certain additional restrictions .",
    "first , the 1-skeleton of the poset must be a simplicial subdivision of a graph , and the unsubdivided graph needs to be deterministically labeled by a set of generators .",
    "next , for all elements @xmath51 of height at least 2 , the geometric realization of the ideal of all elements strictly below @xmath51 must be homotopically equivalent to a circle .",
    "in other words , the simplicial complex corresponding to this ideal should be homotopically equivalent to the space @xmath53 .",
    "if the unique maximum element has height @xmath47 then the general relator @xmath46 is said to be of height @xmath47 , and the @xmath54-skeleton of @xmath46 is called its boundary .",
    "general relators were introduced by the author in @xcite .",
    "notice that the boundary of a general relator is allowed to be fairly complicated as long as it is homotopically equivalent to the unit circle .",
    "although a general relator can contain a 1-skeleton which can be significantly more complicated than is allowed in the traditional theory , the local structure is often less important than its global topology .",
    "one example of a global topological concept which plays a key role in the theory is that of the winding number of a loop .",
    "a winding number is definable in this context because of the homotopic equivalence to the unit circle .",
    "a loop in the boundary of a general relator with winding number 1 will be called a representative of the general relator . using representatives , it is possible to define more or less traditional van kampen diagrams over collections of general relators by requiring that the label of every 2-cell in the planar van kampen diagram be the label of a representative loop in the boundary of some general relator .",
    "[ def - representatives ]    * [ representatives ] * a representative of a general relator @xmath46 is any path in @xmath46 which forms a loop with winding number @xmath55 .",
    "there are no other restrictions on representatives : they can complete five clockwise rotations followed by four counterclockwise ones , they can self - intersect , they can even be unreduced in the free group .",
    "the main use to which these representatives will be put is to define a van kampen diagram over a set of general relators .",
    "[ def - vkdiagrams ]    * [ van kampen diagrams ] * a van kampen diagram over a set @xmath12 of general relators is exactly like a van kampen diagram over a set of traditional relators except that the boundary cycle of each 2-cell in the diagram is a path which maps onto a representative path in one of the general relators in @xmath12 , instead of being a relator itself .    in traditional small cancellation theory van kampen diagrams",
    "are reduced and cancellable pairs are removed until in the reduced diagram a curvature condition forces a large portion of a relator to exist on the boundary . in the general theory described here a similar strategy is pursued , but one situation arises which does not need to be considered in the traditional case .",
    "[ exam - self ]    * [ self - bordering cells ] * the annular diagram shown in figure  [ fig - self ] is a van kampen diagram over the presentation given in figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] . more explicitly , starting at the rightmost vertex , and reading counterclockwise around the outer circle ,",
    "the boundary of the 2-cell in the diagram reads the word @xmath56 , and this is a path which is a representative of the rightmost relator in figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] .",
    "the difficulty that this diagram causes is that the word @xmath45 is long relative to the length of the boundary . in the traditional theory ,",
    "an overlap longer than a piece is prohibited by the fact that no ( nontrivial ) word in the free group is conjugate to its own inverse . the word @xmath57 , however , is conjugate to its own inverse , as figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] demonstrates .",
    "when diagrams such as this are encountered as subdiagrams during the reduction of a van kampen diagram , there must be some way to remove them since the goal of the reductions is to produce a reduced diagram with no long internal arcs .",
    "for example  [ exam - self ] the reduction is easy since the entire annular subdiagram can be removed and the inner and the outer loops labeled @xmath58 can be identified . (",
    "the general situation is more complicated but those details will be glossed over here . )",
    "there is another way to explain the existence of self - bordering cells in the general case .",
    "notice that corresponding to a self - bordering 2-cell which represents a general relator @xmath46 there is a label - preserving automorphism of the boundary of @xmath46 which reverses the orientation of its boundary .",
    "in particular , the self - bordering 2-cell in figure  [ fig - self ] corresponds to the automorphism of figure  [ fig - solid ] which rotates the left- and right - hand @xmath59 loops by 180 degrees .",
    "this automorphism will preserve the labels on the edges but it will reverse the orientation of the circular boundary .",
    "traditional relators can not have automorphisms of this type .",
    "although general relators can have automorphisms which are more complicated than traditional relators , the structure of the possible automorphism groups is fairly restricted by group theoretic standards . before the relevant theorem",
    "is quoted , however , it is necessary to make plain the meaning of two of the expressions used in its statement .",
    "first , the phrase ` closed under subcones ' is just another way of stipulating that a general relator which is contained in the boundary of a general relator in the set @xmath12 must also be contained in @xmath12 .",
    "thus a set of general relators which contains the one whose boundary is shown in figure  [ fig - highrank ] must also contain the general relator shown in figure  [ fig - solid ] .",
    "next , a crucial cone in the boundary of a general relator @xmath46 is , loosely speaking , an edge or a general relator whose removal from the boundary of @xmath46 makes it impossible to complete a representative . in a traditional relator all of its edges are crucial . in the general case , there are some additional restrictions on the way in which the crucial cone is situated in the boundary .",
    "see @xcite for details .",
    "[ thm - autr ] let @xmath12 be a set of general relators closed under subcones and suppose that all general relators in @xmath12 have at least one crucial cone in their boundary . if @xmath60 is a subgroup of the automorphism group of a general relator @xmath61 , then for some @xmath62 there is a group homomorphism from @xmath60 to @xmath63 whose kernel is a 2-group . in particular",
    ", @xmath60 is isomorphic to a cyclic or a dihedral group extended by a 2-group .",
    "the main advantage which general relators present over the traditional type is that certain symmetries which exist in the group can be captured by the relations .",
    "this obviates the need to break these symmetries by making arbitrary choices , such as selecting one representative loop of length 8 in the final relator in figure  [ fig - dihedrals ] and not any of the others .",
    "when these symmetries are incorporated into the general relators themselves , the structure of the group beyond the relator level becomes more visible .",
    "because general relators are allowed to have boundaries which are ` thick ' , the portion of the boundary traversed by a path requires a bit of exposition . along the way",
    ", a length and a width will be prescribed for each general relator .",
    "a single example will be sufficient to illustrate the nuances of these definitions .",
    "[ exam - moebius ]    * [ twisted boundaries ] * consider the presentation    @xmath64    where @xmath65 .",
    "if the relator @xmath57 had been excluded , the presentation would satisfy @xmath26 .",
    "the relator @xmath57 can be altered to form a general relator by attaching a relator to @xmath57 whenever the cycle @xmath57 contains a sizable portion of this other relator .",
    "this process quickly stops at a structure which is a mbius strip .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig - moebius ] except that the arrow on the far left labeled @xmath58 must be glued ( in an orientation - preserving way ) to the arrow on the far right labeled @xmath58 .",
    "the word @xmath57 can be traced in the diagram from the upper left to the lower righthand corner .",
    "notice also that this path becomes a loop under the gluing operation .",
    "the resulting structure satisfies all of the conditions necessary to qualify as the boundary of a general relator .",
    "let @xmath46 be the name of the general relator which results .",
    "the general relator @xmath46 is technically the topological cone over the mbius strip , the mbius strip being merely the boundary of @xmath46 .",
    "the twisting of the boundary which occurs in this example occurs in a great many general small cancellation presentations , including those constructed for the burnside groups .",
    "the general relator @xmath46 decribed above will now be used to illustrate several key definitions .",
    "the first such concept is that of length of a general relator . for a traditional relator ,",
    "the length of its boundary is simply the length of the unique reduced loop of winding number 1 . in the general case",
    "the situation is more subtle . in example",
    "[ exam - moebius ] the loop @xmath57 is the shortest representative of general relator @xmath46 and it has length 7 .",
    "but among those loops with winding number 2 , some have length 12 . for loops with extremely large winding number the geodesic length of the path is more closely approximated by six times the winding number rather than by seven . in order to accurately estimate large geodesic distances ,",
    "the length of a general relator must be based on the smallest average length per winding number .",
    "thus the length of the general relator @xmath46 will be defined to be 6 even though there is no representative loop with that length .",
    "[ def - length ]    * [ length of a general relator ] * the length of a general relator @xmath46 is defined to be the smallest value of the length of a loop in @xmath46 divided by its nonzero winding number .",
    "it is easy to show that such a minimum value must exist , and to create examples where the length of the relator is a fraction instead of an integer .",
    "the length of @xmath46 will be denoted @xmath66 .",
    "finally , notice that for traditional relators , this procedure gives the traditional value for the length .    now that the length of the relator itself has been clarified , it is possible to define the relative length of a path in the boundary of a general relator .",
    "[ def - graphmetric ]    * [ graph metric ] * the ( normalized ) graph metric for a general relator @xmath46 is a function which assigns a nonnegative length to every path in the boundary of @xmath46 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath67 is a path in @xmath46 whose lift to the universal cover of the boundary of @xmath46 is a geodesic path , then the length of @xmath67 relative to @xmath46 , denoted @xmath68 , is the length of @xmath67 divided by the length of @xmath46 .",
    "if the path @xmath67 is not a geodesic when it is lifted to the universal cover of the boundary of @xmath46 , then let @xmath69 be a geodesic path in the universal cover between the same vertices as @xmath67 and set @xmath68 equal to @xmath70 .",
    "equivalently , the normalized length of @xmath67 is the length of the shortest path which is homotopic to @xmath67 in the boundary of @xmath46 relative to its endpoints , divided by the length of @xmath46 defined above .",

    "let @xmath72 represent the universal cover of the boundary of a general relator @xmath46 .",
    "since the boundary of @xmath46 is by definition topologically equivalent to a circle , it seems clear that the universal cover should look topologically like the real line .",

    "these intuitions are true and they can be made precise but we will not do so here .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",

    "also , for convenience , an open ball will be defined so that it always contains the vertex used as its center . as a result ,",
    "the width of a traditional relator is 0 .",

    "assume in addition that the figure is a portion of the universal cover , so that the row of adjacent hexagons extends infinitely in both directions .",
    "an open ball of radius 1 centered at @xmath75 will remove only the vertex @xmath75 and the two open edges incident with it .",
    "an open ball of radius 2 will remove a total of six edges and three vertices , but a path running along the top edge of the structure still succeeds in connecting the ends . with a radius of 3 ,",
    "the ends are disconnected , and the three connected components which result are the positive end , the negative end , and an isolated vertex which is directly above the vertex @xmath75 .",
    "a general presentation is a set of generators @xmath76 together with a collection of general relators @xmath12 which are labeled by @xmath76 .",
    "such a presentation will be denoted @xmath9 .",
    "the group assigned to a particular general presentation is based on the fundamental group of a topological space constructed from the generators and relators . for traditional presentations the standard construction of a 2-complex has the described group as its fundamental group .",

    "the general relator @xmath46 is then attached using the map from the boundary to the developing structure as the attaching map . after all the relators have been added , the result is the completed poincar construction .",

    "the details are as follows .",
    "the universal cover of the poincar construction contains a 1-skeleton which is the cayley graph of this group . as in the traditional theory , the universal cover of the poincar construction may contain multiple copies of a general relator attached to this cayley graph by functions which agree on the 1-skeletons in their boundaries .",
    "this occurs precisely when the general relator under consideration possesses nontrivial automorphisms .",
    "the number of such multiplicities is governed by the size of the automorphism group of the particular general relator involved .",
    "once these multiple copies are eliminated through a suitable identification process , the resulting structure is called the cayley category of the presentation . the map from the universal cover to the poincar construction factors through the cayley category .",
    "if we again use the dihedral group of order 8 as an example , the universal cover of the poincar construction has the cayley graph as its 1-skeleton , and has two disks labeled @xmath59 attached to each @xmath59 loop , and two disks labeled @xmath77 attached to each @xmath77 loop . if we forget the way they are mapped into the poincar construction , there is a natural way to identify two disks which are already attached along their boundaries .",
    "once we perform these identifications , we next look at the 3-skeleton .",
    "we now have eight copies of figure  [ fig - solid ] attached to the 2-skeleton , one for each of the distinct label - preserving automorphisms of its boundary .",
    "again , we ignore the eight distinct ways in which these are mapped to the poincar construction and simply identify the interiors .",
    "the result in this case is the structure shown in figure  [ fig - solid ] . in general the cayley category",
    "is infinite .",
    "this example is a special case since the relator contains the entire cayley graph in its 1-skeleton .",
    "the height of a general relator defines a filtration on any set of general relators that is sufficient for the above constructions , but it is a filtration which is often not fine enough for more involved operations . for this reason a rank function is allowed which provides an alternative way to order the general relators in a presentation .",

    "following a discussion of these metrics , the axioms of general small cancellation theory will be discussed in detail .",
    "the section concludes with a statement of the results derived in @xcite .      to generalize the small cancellation hypotheses to the context of general relators requires the introduction of functions which measure the extent to which a particular path wraps around the boundary of a general relator .",
    "the function on paths in @xmath46 will be called the relator metric for @xmath46 and it will be denoted @xmath82 .",
    "the use of the term ` metric ' is justified by the fact that the function @xmath82 will induce a metric on the points in the universal cover of the boundary of @xmath46 .",

    "one example of a relator metric which is always available is the normalized graph metric defined in the previous section .",

    "a geodesic is always dehn - reduced but the converse is false .",

    "the multiplicity of metrics and the variety of corresponding reductions arise from various facets implicit in small cancellation theory .",
    "for instance , the curvature condition on van kampen diagrams arises from the purely combinatorial and decidedly nonmetric condition @xmath26 , while the strict shortening of the length of a word is necessary in many cases to guarantee that a process will stop in a finite number of steps .",
    "as long as the metrics are suitably related to each other , different metrics can fulfill these two roles . in the present system these roles will be performed by the relator metrics and the ( normalized ) graph metrics , respectively .",
    "this particular version of general cancellation theory requires seven axioms involving five constants . while the numbers may seem large , the axioms are far from independent , as are the constants . the redundancy built into the system",
    "is intended to improve the overall conceptual clarity .",
    "after the constants and the axioms are described informally , the exact statements will be given .",

    "the situation described in the second axiom is in some sense redundant since whenever the first axiom holds for some @xmath95 , the second axiom holds for @xmath98 equal to the same constant .",
    "axiom three specifies that the ratio of the width of a general relator to its length must be at most @xmath99 .",
