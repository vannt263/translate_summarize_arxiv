    "in this section we consider a theory with a single spin-2 boson and as many spin-1 and spin-0 bosons as required . in this first attempt ,",
    "we do not concern ourselves with gauge invariance but allow the couplings with spin-1 fields to take on whatever lorentz invariant form necessary to achieve a tree - level unitary theory .",
    "we will return to theories that are gauge invariant in sections  [ sec : multiple spin-2 ] , [ sec : adjoint rep ] and [ sec : symmetric cubic term ] .",
    "we consider the most general set of dimension-3 and -4 operators consistent with lorentz invariance that make unique nonvanishing contributions to the tree - level scattering process @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a spin-2 field .",
    "this means that operators that are antisymmetric in the lorentz indices of a single external @xmath8 or trace the lorentz indices of a single external @xmath8 are not included .",
    "it also means that operators that differ only in the interchange of the lorentz indices of a single external @xmath8 are all represented by a single operator from the set .",
    "however , on the other hand , an internal @xmath8 is allowed to have trace and antisymmetric contributions .",
    "our full set of operators along with their resulting feynman rules as well as the propagators for our fields are described in detail in appendix  [ sec : feynman rules ] .",
    "these feynman rules are then used to construct the full set of @xmath0 scattering diagrams which includes the 4-point diagram as well as the s- , t- and u - channel diagrams which contain an intermediate spin-2 @xmath8 , spin-1 @xmath9 or spin-0 @xmath10 , where the subscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 enumerate the spin-1 and spin-0 bosons , respectively .",
    "each of the external spin-2 bosons @xmath8 contains 5 polarizations or helicities .",
    "since there are four external @xmath8 s , there are @xmath13 helicity combinations for this scattering amplitude . however , as described in detail in appendix  [ sec : equivalencies ] , not all of these helicity combinations are linearly independent .",
    "many of them are related by spatial rotations as well as t and p invariance . after taking these symmetries into account ,",
    "only 97 helicity combinations are linearly independent .",
    "we list these 97 linearly independent helicity amplitudes in table  [ tab:97 amps ] .",
    "moreover , we have explicitly calculated all 625 helicity amplitudes and have verified that our calculation satisfies these linear dependencies .    for tree - level unitarity to be valid ,",
    "the energy growth in these helicity amplitudes must vanish for all large energies which are much greater than the masses of the particles and all scattering angles @xmath5 at those energies ( see appendix  [ app : no energy growth ] ) . at these high energies ,",
    "the scattering amplitude can be series expanded in the ratio of the masses divided by the scattering energy , where these ratios are small parameters .",
    "after this expansion , the scattering amplitude is a polynomial in energy and the cosine of the scattering angle @xmath5 ( sometimes with overall factors that are functions of @xmath5 for each power of the energy . )",
    "since each of these polynomial terms are linearly independent , in order for the large energy growth to vanish for all energies and angles @xmath5 , each coefficient must vanish simultaneously .",
    "this gives a system of equations that must be satisfied in order to achieve tree - level unitarity .",
    "for example , the highest potential energy growth is in the amplitude @xmath14 , where the subscript gives the helicities of the external states , and is given by @xmath15\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\mathcal{o}\\left(e^8\\right)\\ , \\label{eq : non - gauge 1st eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the mass of the scattering @xmath8 , @xmath17 is the mass of @xmath9 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are coupling constants for @xmath20 vertices ( see app .  [",
    "app : h^3 interactions ] ) , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are coupling constants for @xmath23 vertices ( see app .  [",
    "sec : h^2v_j interactions ] ) , and we have taken the standard propagators ( see app .  [",
    "app : propagators ] ) for compactness and clarity in these expressions .",
    "although there are three linearly independent powers of @xmath4 in the @xmath24 term , their coefficients are linearly dependent , giving us our first equation ( or sum rule ) that must be satisfied for tree - level unitarity @xmath25    the next highest power of energy growth is an @xmath26 term which has @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 terms .",
    "only one is linearly independent with the coefficient in square brackets in eq .  .",
    "we choose the @xmath29 term which gives the additional constraint @xmath30 where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are coupling constants for @xmath33 vertices ( see app .",
    "[ app : h^4 interactions ] ) and we have again used the standard propagators .",
    "this procedure must be followed for the @xmath34 term , the @xmath35 term and the @xmath36 term , extracting all linearly independent constraints on the couplings and masses .",
    "furthermore , this procedure must be followed for all 97 linearly independent helicity amplitudes .",
    "although it might appear that there would be a very large number of constraints , we find that there are only 7 that are linearly independent .",
    "we also find that all 7 linearly independent constraints can be obtained from the two amplitudes @xmath14 ( see app .",
    "[ app : m0000 ] ) and @xmath37{-}}10}$ ] ( see app .",
    "[ app : m20 - 10 ] ) .",
    "all other constraints are linearly dependent with these .",
    "slightly rearranged for convenience , the first three are @xmath38 while the final 4 equations are @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the mass of @xmath10 , @xmath41 is the coupling constant for the @xmath42 vertex ( see app .",
    "[ app : hhsk interaction ] ) , @xmath43 is a spin-1 propagator numerator coefficient and @xmath44 and @xmath45 are spin-2 propagator numerator coefficients ( see app .",
    "[ app : propagators ] ) .",
    "we have explicitly checked that inserting these sum rules into all 625 tree - level helicity amplitudes removes all high energy growth .",
    "we have also checked that the helicity amplitudes do not identically vanish when using this solution and arbitrary propagator coefficients .",
    "for example , after inserting these relations and using the standard propagator for spin-2 but setting @xmath46 , we have @xmath47    on the other hand , if we use the standard propagators for spin-2 and spin-1 , their numerator coefficients satisfy @xmath48 consequently , our sum rules reduce further to @xmath49 and @xmath50 which clearly satisfies eqs .   and .",
    "the interaction lagrangian for this theory is nontrivial @xmath51 however , interestingly , with this solution and using the standard propagators , all tree - level @xmath7 amplitudes identically vanish independent of the values of the external momenta , lorentz indices and helicities .",
    "nevertheless , it should be noted that the individual diagrams do not vanish .",
    "only the combination of diagrams vanishes after relating the couplings and masses in this way .",
    "other scattering processes should still be nonzero .",
    "because the sum rules for the standard propagator case are so simple , they can be achieved in a theory with only one spin-1 boson @xmath52 , where we have dropped the subscript @xmath11 . in this case , the lagrangian is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 is some small coupling that defines this theory and @xmath55 is not too large .",
    "considering again the general sum rules in eqs .   and , it remains to show that the tree - level @xmath0 scattering amplitudes with other particles in the external states do not grow at high energy .",
    "we first consider amplitudes with one or more external spin-1 @xmath9 s .",
    "we note that our only operator for the spin-1 @xmath9 fields ( see eqs .   and )",
    "contains @xmath56 which identically vanishes on - shell .",
    "that is , the vertex with the external spin-1 @xmath9 will contribute @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the polarization vector for the external @xmath9 ( see app .",
    "[ app : polarization vectors ] ) , and this will vanish because the polarization vector is orthogonal to the momentum of the external particle .",
    "therefore , all tree - level @xmath0 amplitudes with external @xmath9 s trivially satisfy unitarity .",
    "we next consider amplitudes with external spin-0 @xmath10 bosons .",
    "the operator in eq .   will result in amplitudes with one or two @xmath10 s in the external states along with @xmath8 s .",
    "we have checked these amplitudes and find that the conditions in eqs .   and are not sufficient to nontrivially remove the high energy growth in these amplitudes .",
    "however , we are free to add other three- and four - point operators that could contribute to these processes but not to @xmath59 .",
    "we expect that it would be possible to choose the couplings of these new operators such that tree - level unitarity would also be satisfied in amplitudes with external @xmath10 s .",
    "however , since our goal was to achieve a non - trivial theory with massive spin-2 bosons that is tree - level unitary , we note that we can accomplish this with only the spin-1 bosons by taking the further condition @xmath60 along with the reduced set of constraints @xmath61 the theory that satisfies these constraints removes the polynomial high energy growth in all tree - level @xmath0 scattering amplitudes .",
    "its interaction lagrangian is the same as in eq .  .",
    "although we have achieved tree - level unitarity in this theory , we should comment that we do not expect our sum rules to be sufficient to unitarize the theory at higher loop - level .",
    "in fact , at higher perturbative order , new diagrams contribute which alter the set of sum rules outlined here , likely modifying these simple relations . on the other hand",
    ", the new diagrams also include contributions from new lagrangian operators that were not used in our analysis , either because their contribution vanishes at tree - level or because their contribution is identical to that given by our operators at tree - level",
    ". however , at loop level , these new operators contribute unique terms in the sum rules and potentially help unitarize the process at higher order .",
    "therefore , at loop level , there are new parameters that can , in principle , be adjusted in order to achieve unitarity . whether this is actually possible in practice is not clear to us .",
    "however , it seems likely that any theory that is perturbatively unitary at the loop - level would require gauge invariance for the spin-1 sector . for this reason",
    ", we now move on to gauge invariant theories .",
    "in this section , we attempt to unitarize the spin-2 scattering in the absence of a spin-1 interaction . we allow multiple spin-2 bosons and spin-0 bosons .",
    "since we do not have any interactions with a spin-1 boson , it is trivially gauge invariant . as in the previous section",
    ", we consider the most general dimension-3 and -4 operators consistent with lorentz invariance that make unique nonvanishing contributions to the tree - level process @xmath7 .",
    "our full set of operators along with their resulting feynman rules are described in detail in appendix  [ sec : feynman rules ] .",
    "we then use these feynman rules to construct the full set of @xmath0 scattering diagrams which includes the 4-point diagram as well as the s- , t- and u - channel diagrams which contain an intermediate spin-2 @xmath8 or @xmath62 ( where @xmath62 is another spin-2 boson different than the one that is scattering ) or a spin-0 @xmath10 . as in the previous section",
    ", we have explicitly checked that our calculation of the 625 helicity amplitudes satisfy the equivalencies outlined in appendix  [ sec : equivalencies ] with only 97 being linearly dependent .",
    "we series expand each helicity amplitude in large energy and demand that the coefficient of each positive power of energy and each unique term in @xmath4 must vanish .",
    "this gives us a set of sum rules that must be satisfied in order for unitarity to be valid at tree - level in this theory .",
    "as in the previous section , we find that the amplitudes @xmath14 and @xmath37{-}}10}$ ] are sufficient to give us our result . among the sum rules that we find",
    "are @xmath63 which can be obtained purely from @xmath37{-}}10}$ ] .",
    "since this is the sum of positive numbers , the only way to satisfy these sum rules is to take @xmath64 this is in contrast to the previous section where we included spin-1 bosons and they contributed to these sum rules with the opposite sign ( see , for example , the second equation of eq .  ) .",
    "however , in the present absence of spin-1 fields , once the @xmath20 and @xmath65 vertices vanish , we have only the @xmath33 vertices and the @xmath42 vertices and we find that they are not sufficient to unitarize this process nontrivially . the only solution in this case is the trivial solution where all coupling constants are set to zero .",
    "therefore , we find that it is impossible to perturbatively unitarize massive spin-2 scattering with only dimension-3 and -4 operators in the absence of interactions with spin-1 bosons .",
    "this is in interesting contrast to spin-1 scattering which can be unitizarized with only spin-1 bosons @xcite and spin-@xmath6 fermions scattering to spin-1 bosons which can be unitarized with only spin-@xmath6 fermions and spin-1 bosons @xcite , both with no need for lower spin fields .",
    "in this section , we reintroduce the spin-1 field as a gauge boson and demand that the spin-2 boson interacts with it in a gauge invariant way . since we consider only real spin-2 bosons in this paper , we use the simplest real representation that is present in all compact lie groups , namely the adjoint representation .",
    "we consider the most general lorentz and gauge invariant dimension-3 and -4 operators ( see appendix  [ sec : feynman rules ] ) that contribute to the process @xmath66 , where the subscript @xmath67 is the adjoint gauge index .",
    "we then use these feynman rules to construct the full set of @xmath0 tree - level scattering diagrams which includes the 4-point diagram as well as the s- , t- and u - channel diagrams which contain an intermediate spin-2 @xmath8 or @xmath62 , an intermediate spin-1 gauge boson @xmath52 or a spin-0 @xmath10 .",
    "we find that our helicity amplitudes do not depend on @xmath43 in the spin-1 propagator .",
    "this is as we expect since our interactions are gauge invariant . as in the previous two sections",
    ", we explicitly check that the 625 helicity combinations satisfy the equivalencies outlined in appendix  [ sec : equivalencies ] with only 97 being linearly independent .",
    "we also find that , in this case , the contribution from an intermediate spin-2 boson vanishes identically .",
    "the reason for this is that the only operator with a product of three fields that each transform under the adjoint representation of the gauge group is totally antisymmetric in the gauge index .",
    "that is , the gauge index is contracted by the structure constant which is totally antisymmetric .",
    "the two possible terms we could have are @xmath68 for an intermediate @xmath8 and @xmath69 for an intermediate @xmath62 . the first operator in each pair is identically zero due to the antisymmetry of the structure constant on the first two fields .",
    "the second term is nonzero but gives a feynman rule that is antisymmetric in the lorentz indices of one of the three fields ( see eqs .   and ) .",
    "however , when it is used in a feynman diagram , since the external polarization vectors are symmetric in their lorentz indices and since the spin-2 propagator is symmetric in each pair of its lorentz indices ( see table  [ tab : fields ] ) , the contribution from this vertex also vanishes .",
    "this means that intermediate spin-2 bosons can not help unitarize the spin-2 scattering amplitude when the spin-2 bosons transform under the adjoint representation of one gauge group .",
    "after series expanding the remaining contributions to @xmath14 in large energy and setting the coefficients of each positive power of energy and @xmath4 to zero , we get the following set of constraints that must be satisfied for tree - level unitarity @xmath70 the last two constraints set the sum of positive terms equal to zero .",
    "therefore , the only solution to these equations is the trivial one where all contributing couplings are zero @xmath71 on the other hand , the couplings @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 could be nonzero and still allow tree - level unitarity , since they do not contribute to @xmath0 scattering at tree - level .",
    "however , this case is very different than that of sec .  [",
    "sec : non gauge - invariant ] with the standard propagators where a nontrivial cancellation happened between the diagrams . in this section",
    ", each diagram vanishes independently and the @xmath0 scattering is trivial .",
    "in the last section , where the spin-2 bosons transformed under the adjoint representation of one gauge group , we found that diagrams with spin-2 intermediate states identically vanished and could not contribute to the unitarization of the tree - level scattering .",
    "we found that this was due to the antisymmetry of the structure constant in the @xmath20 and @xmath65 lagrangian operators , which produced feynman rules that were antisymmetric in the lorentz indices of at least one @xmath8 or @xmath62 .",
    "combined with the symmetry of the lorentz indices of the external polarization vector and the spin-2 propagator , these diagrams vanished individually . in the present section , on the other hand , we would like to consider a theory whose interactions are gauge invariant and which also have non - vanishing contributions from intermediate spin-2 states .",
    "we do this by constructing a theory with two gauge groups where the spin-2 bosons transform under the adjoint representation of both groups . as a result",
    ", the operators with three spin-2 fields will have two structure constants as in @xmath75 for an intermediate @xmath8 and @xmath76 for an intermediate @xmath62 .",
    "all of these operators are now nonzero and can contribute nontrivially to the amplitude .    as in previous sections",
    ", we consider the most general lorentz and gauge invariant operators ( see appendix  [ sec : feynman rules ] ) that contribute to the process @xmath77 , where the subscripts @xmath78 and @xmath67 are the adjoint gauge indices of the two gauge groups .",
    "we then use these feynman rules to construct the full set of @xmath0 scattering diagrams which include the 4-point diagram as well as the s- , t- and u - channel diagrams which contain an intermediate spin-2 @xmath8 or @xmath62 , an intermediate spin-1 gauge boson @xmath79 or @xmath80 , or a spin-0 boson @xmath10 .",
    "we find that , as in the previous section , our results do not depend on @xmath43 in the spin-1 propagator , as we expect since our interactions are gauge invariant . as in the previous three sections",
    ", we explicitly check that all 625 helicity combinations satisfy the equivalencies outlined in appendix  [ sec : equivalencies ] with only 97 being linearly independent .",
    "we again , as in previous sections , series expand the amplitudes in large energy and set the coefficient of each positive power of energy and each power of @xmath4 to zero in order to ensure unitarity at high energy .",
    "this gives us a set of constraints on the couplings and masses that must be satisfied . among the constraints we get from the @xmath14 amplitude are @xmath81 each of these",
    "is the sum of positive terms which , therefore , requires that each of these coupling is zero .",
    "consequently , we see that , although we constructed a theory where the spin-2 bosons could , in principle , contribute as intermediate states to the @xmath0 scattering , in practice they do not help .",
    "all the @xmath20 and @xmath65 couplings must vanish in order to achieve perturbative unitarity .",
    "additionally , we also find that the couplings to gauge bosons and scalar bosons must vanish . with these results , we find that the only couplings allowed to be nonzero must satisfy the following constraints @xmath82 these couplings are all @xmath33 couplings .",
    "there are no longer any s- , t- or u - channel diagrams .",
    "the 4-point diagrams cancel among themselves and the amplitude is identically zero .",
    "this case is very different than that in section  [ sec : non gauge - invariant ] where there was a nontrivial cancellation between 4-point and s- , t- and u - channel diagrams . in the present case , each of these is zero individually and the theory is trivial .",
    "a theory with gauge invariant operators and nontrivial contributions from intermediate spin-2 states , as formulated here , is not sufficient to achieve perturbative unitarity .",
    "we have analyzed the tree - level unitarity of @xmath0 scattering in a set of illustrative quantum field theories which contain a massive spin-2 boson . we have focused on theories with only dimension-3 and -4 operators and only spins 0 , 1 and 2 . for convenience",
    ", we have taken all our fields to be real .    in section  [ sec : non gauge - invariant ] , we considered a theory with a single spin-2 boson and as many spin-0 and -1 bosons as required to achieve unitarity , however , we did not force our interactions to be gauge invariant at this point , but allowed the operators to take on whatever lorentz invariant form was required to achieve unitarity .",
    "we found that tree - level unitarity was possible in this case as long as the coupling constants and masses satisfied a set of sum rules , which were presented in eqs .   and .",
    "we further showed that , for general propagators , this set of constraints did not cause the amplitude to identically vanish for all energies and angles and demonstrated this by presenting the leading term in the amplitude for a particular choice of propagators in eq .  .",
    "on the other hand , if the standard propagators were used , we showed that the constraints simplified further to those given in eqs .   and with the nontrivial lagrangian given in eq .  .",
    "with this theory and using the standard propagators , we noted that the amplitude vanished identically for all energies and angles .",
    "however , we pointed out that this was due to a nontrivial cancellation between the various diagrams and that other scattering processes should still be nonzero .",
    "this was followed by noting that a theory with one spin-2 boson and one spin-1 boson with the lagrangian given in eq .",
    "satisfied tree - level unitarity in all @xmath0 scattering processes . following this , we commented on the fact that the sum rules would likely be modified at the loop - level and require the further adjustment of new lagrangian operators that were not required for the tree - level analysis .",
    "although it is possible that perturbative unitarity is achievable even at the loop - level , we consider it likely that perturbative unitarity at higher loops requires gauge invariance of the spin-1 sector .    in section  [ sec : multiple spin-2",
    "] , we removed the spin-1 boson and concentrated on a theory with only spin-2 bosons and spin-0 bosons , but as many of each of these as required to achieve unitarity .",
    "we noted that this theory is trivially gauge invariant . in this case",
    ", we found that , among the sum rules for this theory , there are two , shown in eq .  , that equate the sum of positive terms to zero which can only be satisfied if all the coupling constants for three spin-2 bosons vanish .",
    "we then , further , found that the remaining interactions are not sufficient to unitarize the scattering unless all couplings are zero and the theory becomes trivial .",
    "we noted that this was in contrast to what occurs in higgsless theories where it has been shown that all the high energy growth of massive spin-1 scattering can be cancelled purely by other massive spin-1 bosons @xcite and all the high energy growth of massive spin-@xmath6 scattering to massive spin-1 bosons can be cancelled purely by other massive spin-@xmath6 fermions and spin-1 bosons @xcite , both of which make no use of lower spin fields .    in section  [ sec : adjoint rep ] , we reintroduced a single spin-1 field as a gauge boson and required that all interactions were gauge invariant under this group .",
    "we took the spin-2 boson to transform under the simplest real representation which is present in all gauge groups , the adjoint representation .",
    "we discussed the fact that the lagrangian operators with three spin-2 bosons must be constructed with the structure constant of the gauge group , as shown in eqs .   and .",
    "this lead to the vanishing of one of the lagrangian operators .",
    "the other lagrangian operator did not vanish , but produced a feynman rule that was antisymmetric in the lorentz indices of one of its spin-2 fields .",
    "when combined with the symmetry of the lorentz indices in the polarization vectors and the propagator , this operator gave a vanishing contribution to the amplitude .",
    "we then found the sum rules for the remaining couplings , presented in eq .  , and found that only the trivial solution with all other couplings set to zero was allowed .    in section",
    "[ sec : symmetric cubic term ] , we considered again a gauge invariant theory .",
    "however , this time we constructed it in such a way that diagrams with intermediate spin-2 bosons did not identically vanish and therefore could , in principle , contribute to the unitarization of the scattering .",
    "we did this by including two gauge groups and having the spin-2 bosons transform under the adjoint representation of both gauge groups . with this definition",
    ", we found that the lagrangian operators , presented in eqs .   and , with three spin-2 bosons did not vanish and generated feynman rules which were symmetric in the lorentz indices on each field .",
    "nevertheless , we found that the sum rules for this theory , given in eq .",
    ", required all these couplings to be zero , and the spin-2 bosons were still not able to help unitarize the scattering by contributing in the intermediate states .",
    "as in the previous section , the sum rules only allowed the trivial solution where the amplitude identically vanished and no nontrivial cancellation between diagrams occurred .    from our result ,",
    "it is still not possible to determine whether all gauge invariant theories with real massive spin-2 bosons , only spins 2 and lower , and only relevant and marginal operators can be made perturbatively unitary .",
    "for one thing , we did not consider arbitrary real representations under an arbitrary number of gauge groups .",
    "we also did not consider complex spin-2 bosons transforming under complex representations of the gauge groups .",
    "it is conceivable that there are special representations and special numbers of gauge groups , under which perturbative unitarity is achievable .",
    "it seems to us that , it might be possible to construct a general argument either discovering a gauge invariant theory that is unitary or a general proof , perhaps by induction , that such a theory is impossible .",
    "additionally , we note that string theory predicts an infinite set of spins including all spins higher than 2 as well as those which are lower @xcite .",
    "it is conceivable that the perturbative unitarity of scattering of particles with spin greater than 1 requires these fields to interact with an infinite set of fields with an infinite number of spins @xcite . finally , it is also possible that nontrivial higher spin fields can not be made perturbatively unitary at very high energies in quantum field theory and that this can only be accomplished in a more fundamental theory , such as string theory .",
    "we hope this is not the case .",
    "in this appendix , we review how the unitarity of the @xmath83-matrix implies that the scattering amplitude must remain below a constant and , therefore , can not grow indefinitely with energy .",
    "thus , at very high energy , all polynomial energy growth must vanish . in app .",
    "[ app : heuristic ] , we give a heuristic proof based on finite dimensional spaces while in app .",
    "[ app : optical ] , we give a more complete proof in the case of an infinite dimensional hilbert space , but only for @xmath0 scattering . a bound on the amplitude",
    "was originally found by froissart @xcite .      in this subsection",
    ", we give a heuristic review of the unitarity bound on scattering amplitudes that will only be strictly valid for finite dimensional spaces . in the next subsection",
    ", we will consider infinite dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the @xmath83-operator is defined to give the @xmath83-matrix when acting on free - particle states @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are a complete specification of the incoming and outgoing free - particle states .",
    "since the probability of this transition is equal to the square of the @xmath83-matrix and the sum of probabilities over the complete set of outgoing free - particle states must add to one @xmath87 we have the relation @xmath88 giving us the unitarity of the @xmath83-operator .",
    "we can form the scattering part of this operator by removing the identity as in @xmath89 solving for @xmath90 , we have @xmath91 since @xmath83 is unitary , it can be written as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is hermitian and diagonalizable . as a result ,",
    "we can rewrite @xmath90 as @xmath94 in the diagonal basis , where the exponential and the sin of an operator are defined in terms of their series expansion . inserting this operator between free particle states gives the amplitude @xmath95 if we expand the initial and final free - particle states in terms of the eigenstates @xmath96 , @xmath97 where @xmath98 , we have @xmath99 the absolute value of this satisfies the triangle inequality @xmath100 where we have dropped the phase @xmath101 since it does not affect the absolute value and @xmath102 since it only strengthens this inequality .",
    "this is the inner product of two vectors , so by the cauchy - schwartz inequality , @xmath103 consequently , we see that in a finite dimensional space , the amplitude must always be below a constant .",
    "this means that the amplitude can not grow indefinitely with energy , or in other words , any energy growth must be cancelled at very high energies .",

    "<S> it is generally believed that all theories with a finite number of fields of spin greater than one are nonrenormalizable and perturbatively nonunitary @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there have been several no - go theorems for a finite number of massless fields with higher spin @xcite . in the case of gravitational theories , </S>",
    "<S> the nonrenormalizability has been shown to occur at one - loop for scalar fields , fermions and gauge fields coupled to gravity @xcite , while pure gravitational theories have been shown to be nonrenormalizable at two - loops @xcite . with these high - profile failures , </S>",
    "<S> the renormalizability of theories with spin-2 fields might seem hopeless . </S>",
    "<S> however , on the other hand , @xmath1 supergravity theories have been shown to be divergence free up to at least four - loop order @xcite with work currently under way at five loops @xcite . also , new directions in scattering theory that bypass fields altogether look promising for consistently describing spin-2 particles @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , to the best of our knowledge , it has never been formally proved that _ all _ theories of spin-2 bosons are nonrenormalizable .    finding a fully renormalizable and perturbatively unitary theory of interacting spin-2 bosons is a great challenge and we certainly do not claim to have achieved this in the present article . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we take on a much more modest challenge . </S>",
    "<S> we attempt to find a theory of massive spin-2 bosons that only contains relevant ( dimension-3 ) operator and marginal ( dimension-4 ) operator interactions with fields of spin-0 , spin-1 , and spin-2 that is tree - level unitary at high energy . </S>",
    "<S> since in the present article , we are interested in the general existence of such a theory , for the moment , we completely ignore any higher symmetry and focus instead on freely choosing the lorentz invariant operators that will give tree - level unitarity . with this in mind , </S>",
    "<S> we admit right away that our results may have no relevance to gravitational type theories . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we think this is an interesting quantum field theory question and we leave our minds open to what , if any , possible future applications may come from this . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to freely choose our couplings in a way that achieves our goal of a tree - level unitary theory .    </S>",
    "<S> this article is organized as follows : in app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ app : no energy growth ] , we review the fact that unitarity implies a lack of polynomial energy growth at high energies in @xmath0 scattering processes . when we say that we have achieved tree - level unitarity in our theory , </S>",
    "<S> we mean that we have cancelled this polynomial high energy growth in all tree - level @xmath0 scattering processes and the theory is , with appropriate choice of couplings and masses , tree - level unitary up to some high energy scale , such as the planck scale . in app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : feynman rules ] , we list all possible lorentz invariant relevant and marginal operators that give a unique non - zero contribution to the tree - level @xmath0 scattering amplitudes of our massive spin-2 particle . </S>",
    "<S> we also describe the propagators that we use for each spin . for convenience , we take all our fields to be real . in app .  [ </S>",
    "<S> app : polarization vectors ] , we describe our conventions for the momenta and polarization vectors . in app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : equivalencies ] , we describe the relationships between the helicity amplitudes due to rotational , p and t invariance and show that only 97 of the 625 helicity amplitudes are linearly independent . in app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ app : m0000 ] , we give the high polynomial energy contributions to the @xmath0 scattering amplitude from each diagram for the external helicities @xmath2 while in app .  </S>",
    "<S> [ app : m20 - 10 ] , we do the same for helicities @xmath3 . this appendix can be used to check the readers calculation against ours .    with these details out of the way </S>",
    "<S> , we focus , in the main body of this article , on the sum rules between the couplings and the masses that result from demanding tree - level unitarity of the @xmath0 scattering amplitudes . we do this by series expanding the amplitudes in the small ratio of masses divided by the energy of the collision . with this expansion , the amplitudes are polynomials in the energy and @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scattering angle . </S>",
    "<S> since the high energy growth must cancel for all high energies and all angles , and since each power of energy and @xmath4 are linearly independent , the only way for tree - level unitarity to be satisfied is for the coefficient of each positive power of energy and @xmath4 to vanish . </S>",
    "<S> this gives a system of equations relating the coupling constants and the masses that must be satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> since this must be done for all helicity combinations of the external particles , it might at first appear that this system of equations will be very badly over - constrained . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of these equations are linearly dependent and the final system of equations can be satisfied in some but not all cases as we will describe for four illustrative cases .    in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : non gauge - invariant ] , we consider theories with only one spin-2 boson and any number of spin-1 and spin-0 bosons . in this section , we do _ not _ enforce gauge invariance but allow the spin-1 couplings to take on any lorentz invariant form . </S>",
    "<S> we present the sum - rules between the couplings and masses that must be satisfied for tree - level unitarity to be achieved and discuss scenarios where these sum - rules are fulfilled . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : multiple spin-2 ] , we consider theories with no spin-1 bosons which are , therefore , trivially gauge invariant . </S>",
    "<S> we do , however , allow as many spin-2 and spin-0 bosons as required to achieve unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous case , we find that only the trivial solution where all the couplings are zero satisfies the system of equations required for unitarity . </S>",
    "<S> this is in interesting distinction compared to what occurs in higgsless theories where it is found that massive spin-@xmath6 and -1 scattering can be made perturbatively unitary in the absence of fields of lower spin @xcite . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : adjoint rep ] , we bring back the spin-1 field as a gauge boson and require that all interaction operators are gauge invariant . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the gauge boson , we allow as many spin-2 and spin-0 fields as required for unitarity and take the spin-2 fields to transform under the adjoint representation of the group . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find in this case that , due to the antisymmetry of the structure constant , the diagrams with intermediate spin-2 fields all identically vanish and can not contribute to the unitarization of the scattering process . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that only the trivial theory with all potentially contributing couplings vanishing is allowed . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : symmetric cubic term ] , we again consider a theory with only gauge invariant interactions . </S>",
    "<S> however , this time we include two gauge groups and take the spin-2 fields to transform under the adjoint representation of both gauge groups . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the previous case , we find that diagrams with intermediate spin-2 fields do contribute to the scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> we again allow as many spin-2 and spin-0 fields as necessary . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we again find that only the trivial solution with all couplings set to zero is allowed by unitarity . in sec .  </S>",
    "<S> [ sec : conclusion ] , we conclude . </S>"
