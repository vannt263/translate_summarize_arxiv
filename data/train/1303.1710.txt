    "interactions of chiral fermions with magnetic fields are the origin of a number of nontrivial physical phenomena , which have been intensively studied in the last few years @xcite .",
    "some of the most notable examples of such phenomena are the chiral magnetic effect ( cme ) @xcite , which is the generation of electric current in a system of chiral fermions at finite chiral chemical potential , and the chiral separation effect ( cse ) @xcite , the generation of chiral current in a system of chiral fermions at finite chemical potential .",
    "the most striking feature of such phenomena is that electric current is generated due to the magnetic field , so that no electric field is needed to initiate the transport of charge / chirality .",
    "rather , this current has a topological nature related to the axial anomaly for chiral fermions and spin projection in the lowest landau level @xcite and flows without dissipation even for interacting fermions @xcite .",
    "experimentally , such phenomena are supposed to manifest themselves in specific features of the distributions of charged particles produced in heavy ion collisions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe a similar phenomenon , in which an electric charge , rather than current , is generated in a system of dirac fermions in the presence of an external magnetic field . for this reason we call it",
    "`` charge catalysis by a magnetic field '' . to this end",
    "the fermions , in addition to charge and chirality , should carry yet another quantum number , which we call isospin @xmath0 ( not to be confused with the term isospin commonly used in particle physics ) and assume that it takes values @xmath1 . in qcd , this additional quantum number is naturally associated with color .",
    "the fermions should also interact with an isospin magnetic field , or a chromomagnetic field in the case of qcd , for which the vector potential @xmath2 enters the action as @xmath3 .",
    "we consider a grand canonical ensemble at nonzero isospin chemical potential @xmath4 which enters the action as @xmath5 and thus favors particles with @xmath6 and anti - particles with @xmath7 and disfavors particles with @xmath7 and anti - particles with @xmath6 .",
    "for qcd , the role of imaginary isospin chemical potential can be also played by the time - like component of non - abelian gauge field .",
    "the generated charge is also imaginary in this case , and shows up only in charge fluctuations after the functional integration over the non - abelian gauge field .",
    "while the mechanism of the described effect is not directly related to the axial anomaly , it is still similar to cme in the sense that charge generation ( which also manifests itself as spatial separation of positive and negative charges , as we will demonstrate in subsection [ subsec : charge_halo ] ) is caused by magnetic , rather than electric field , and has a purely quantum origin related to the two - dimensional index theorem . as we argue in subsection [ subsec : temperature ] , for a classical gas of charged particles this effect would be absent .",
    "it should be stressed that it is the assumption of a grand canonical ensemble that makes the generation of charge possible : the system is not isolated , but rather coupled to an environment , with which it can exchange particles .",
    "thus the extra charge comes from the environment , and charge conservation is not violated .",
    "the system then acquires electric charge _ only _ if all three factors are present : an ordinary magnetic field , an isospin magnetic field and a nonzero isospin chemical potential @xmath4 . at vanishing temperature",
    ", the latter can be arbitrarily small .",
    "the mechanism of this phenomenon can be also reversed , so that an isospin polarization is generated at nonzero ordinary chemical potential @xmath8 ( which couples to electric charge ) , again in the presence of both ordinary and isospin magnetic fields .",
    "we should note here that this work was in fact originally motivated by an attempt to describe the chiral magnetic effect @xcite by using calorons , topologically nontrivial classical solutions of finite - temperature yang - mills equations @xcite , in external magnetic fields as a model for topological transitions in qcd at finite temperature ( see subsection [ subsec : caloron ] ) . while we have found no traces of electric current flowing along the magnetic field , we have noticed the emergence of a nonzero imaginary charge density induced by a magnetic field parallel to the caloron axis .",
    "the present work was initiated as an attempt to understand this peculiar effect .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in section [ sec : uniform ] we start with a simple description of charge catalysis at zero temperature and at small values of the isospin chemical potential , and in subsection [ subsec : temperature ] discuss the case of arbitrary temperatures / chemical potentials .",
    "the dependence of the induced charge on isospin chemical potential turns out to be quite nontrivial and is in some sense similar to shubnikov - de haas oscillations . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : charge_halo ] we consider the case of spatially localized magnetic and isospin magnetic fields .",
    "we demonstrate that even in the case when the net induced charge is zero , there is still an excess of charge in the region with nonzero field strength , which is compensated by an excess of charge of opposite sign in a `` halo '' around that region .",
    "thus in such a setting the magnetic field induces spatial charge separation . in section [ sec : graphene ]",
    "we illustrate the described mechanism on a very simple and at the same time physically relevant example of strained monolayer graphene . in this case the isospin index corresponds to two distinct valleys in the graphene brillouin zone and the isospin magnetic field is the pseudo - magnetic field arising due to mechanical strain @xcite . in section [ sec : qcd ]",
    "we discuss possible manifestations of charge catalysis in finite - temperature qcd , for which the role of isospin is played by the color of quarks and that of the isospin chemical potential by a nontrivial holonomy ( polyakov loop ) of a gauge field configuration .",
    "we first consider a simple example of a constant non - abelian gauge field and demonstrate that while the net electric charge vanishes in this case due to integration over all values of the holonomy , the described phenomenon still manifests itself in the suppression of charge fluctuations . in subsection [ subsec",
    ": caloron ] we consider a more realistic example of an @xmath9 caloron gauge field configuration .",
    "we show numerically that the induced charge is localized between the monopole and the anti - monopole which constitute the caloron , that is , in the region where the chromo - magnetic field is approximately constant . finally , in subsection [ subsec : experiment ] we roughly estimate the possible contribution of the discussed effect to charge fluctuations in off - central heavy - ion collisions , using both the model of a uniform chromomagnetic field with fluctuating holonomy ( subsection [ subsec : const_field_qcd ] ) as well as a model of a dilute caloron gas @xcite .",
    "let us denote the strength of the ordinary magnetic field as @xmath10 , and the strength of the isospin magnetic field as @xmath11 . for simplicity",
    "we first assume that the fermions are @xmath12-dimensional , but our arguments can be easily generalized to @xmath13-dimensional case .",
    "the magnetic and the isospin magnetic fields in @xmath14 dimensions have only a single component , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the energy spectrum of fermions in such a background is given by the landau levels ( we assume magnetic fields in the cgs units in the denominator . ] ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 , the labels @xmath19 and @xmath1 denote particle / antiparticle states and the isospin quantum number , respectively , @xmath20 is the electron charge , @xmath21 is the speed of light and @xmath22 is the fermi velocity . for relativistic fermions ( electrons or quarks in quark - gluon plasma ) @xmath23 ,",
    "but for dirac quasiparticles in graphene @xmath22 is significantly smaller , @xmath24 @xcite .",

    "the degeneracies of the landau levels are @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the fluxes of the magnetic and the isospin magnetic fields through the area @xmath33 of the system . for definiteness",
    ", we have assumed periodic boundary conditions for spatial directions , which implies that @xmath34 and @xmath35 take integer values @xcite . from now on we work in natural units with @xmath36 in order to shorten the notation ( in particular , this means that the physical electron or quark charge is absorbed into the units in which @xmath11 and @xmath10 are expressed ) .",
    "it also follows from ( [ landau_levels ] ) that the effect of the fermi velocity @xmath22 is to simply rescale all the energies by @xmath22 .",
    "thus for the sake of simplicity we also assume that @xmath37 .",

    "simplicity let us first assume that @xmath41 and that the temperature is zero ( these conditions will be relaxed in the next subsection ) . in this case only the lowest landau levels for particles ( @xmath42 ) with @xmath6 and anti - particles ( @xmath43 ) with @xmath7 will be occupied .",
    "the degeneracies of these levels are @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , and thus different ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels_shift_general ] ) . therefore , if both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are present , there is an unequal number of particles and antiparticles on these levels , and the system has a nonzero electric charge : @xmath46 if the strength of the isospin magnetic field @xmath11 is kept constant , the charge grows linearly with @xmath10 for @xmath47 and then saturates at @xmath48 . if @xmath47 , increasing the flux @xmath34 by one flux quantum produces two elementary charges .",
    "we also note that since the existence of zero energy level in the magnetic field is topologically protected in @xmath14 dimensions , the result ( [ charge_generated ] ) is also valid for non - uniform gauge fields as long as @xmath4 is smaller than the first non - zero energy level .",
    "finally , we note that the mechanism described above can be reversed by switching on the ordinary chemical potential which couples to electric charge and thus increases the fermi energy for particles and decreases it for anti - particles .",
    "then only the lowest landau levels for particles will be occupied , independently of @xmath0 .",
    "the degeneracies of the lowest landau levels for particles with @xmath6 and @xmath7 are again given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively , and thus different again .",

    "consider first the case of zero temperature but an arbitrary value of isospin chemical potential .",
    "the equation ( [ charge_generated ] ) is then easily generalized to @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the floor function .",

    "[ fig : charge_generated_high_mu ] for an illustration .",
    "depending on how many landau levels occupied by particles or anti - particles lie below @xmath4 , the charge @xmath60 can take both positive and negative values .",
    "the charge decreases if one of the more closely spaced negatively charged states sinks below the fermi energy and increases if this happens for one of the more widely separated positively charged states .",
    "it is also easy to prove that the charge ( [ charge_generated_high_mu ] ) is a periodic function of @xmath61 with a period equal to @xmath62 , where @xmath63 stands for the least common multiple of two integers @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the dependence of the induced charge density on the magnetic field at fixed isospin chemical potential exhibits oscillations similar to shubnikov - de haas oscillations , see fig .",
    "[ fig : charge_generated_high_mu ] below .",
    "however , while in the latter case the period of oscillations tends to zero at zero magnetic field , here this happens at @xmath11 close to @xmath10 , when the spacing between energy levels for anti - particles with @xmath7 becomes very small .    in case of finite temperature the floor functions in ( [ charge_generated_high_mu ] )",
    "are smoothed out by the corresponding fermi factors , so that the charge is given by @xmath66 we have evaluated these sums numerically .",
    "the resulting dependence of the generated charge on @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : charge_generated_high_mu ] .",
    "one can see that now the dependence of the generated charge on @xmath4 , @xmath11 and @xmath10 becomes continuous . however , the charge still changes sign as @xmath4 is changed .",
    "since the asymptotic density of states for landau levels in both sectors with @xmath1 is equal ( since smaller spacing between landau levels is compensated for by smaller level degeneracy ) , at very high temperatures and/or isospin chemical potentials the generated charge should vanish .",
    "asymptotic equality of the density of states in both sectors implies also that the described effect should vanish in the classical limit , when a macroscopically large number of levels is occupied .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , the generation of charge is only possible for the grand canonical ensemble , that is , for a system coupled to some environment , from which the charge is `` borrowed '' , and charge conservation is not violated . in this subsection",
    "we investigate in more details the situation in which the charge density is generated locally , but the net charge is still zero . we show that this situation can be interpreted as spatial charge separation .",
    "let us formally assume that the space is infinite and the magnetic field strengths are described by some localized functions . in this case",
    "normalizable eigenmodes with zero energy exist also for non - integer values of the fluxes @xmath34 , @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "their number is given by the floor functions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , so that the equation ( [ charge_generated ] ) reads in this case @xmath67 in deriving ( [ charge_generated_aharonov ] ) we have again assumed that there is a small but finite isospin chemical potential @xmath4 so that only the particle zero energy states with @xmath68 and antiparticle zero energy states with @xmath69 are filled .    we now restrict ourselves to the situation in which both fluxes @xmath35 and @xmath34 are nonzero , but the total charge ( [ charge_generated_aharonov ] ) is still zero . for example , one can take @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "if the region in which the magnetic field is localized is sufficiently small , one can still have very large magnetic fields locally .",
    "we would like to study here whether the charge is generated locally in this case , and how it is distributed .",
    "as the simplest example let us assume that both fields @xmath10 and @xmath11 take constant values in the region @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the radial coordinate in two spatial dimensions , and are equal to zero outside of this region .",
    "the wave functions of the zero energy states can be found analytically as @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the unit spinor which is the eigenstate of the projection of the spin operator on the magnetic field with eigenvalue @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the solution of the poisson equation @xmath80 it is easy to see that the eigenvectors ( [ eq:2dzeromodes ] ) are orthogonal to each other for cylindrically symmetric distributions of magnetic field ( in the absence of cylindrical symmetry this might not be the case ) . solving the equation ( [ eq : poisson ] ) for magnetic field which is localized in a cylinder of radius @xmath81 we obtain @xmath82 the wave functions ( [ eq:2dzeromodes ] ) are then : @xmath83 although the normalization constants @xmath84 can be calculated analytically , the resulting expressions are not very instructive and we do not give them here .",
    "it is important to note , however , that for large @xmath85 and @xmath86 they behave as @xmath87    under the assumption that all the zero energy states are occupied , the charge density is given by @xmath88 where @xmath89 .",
    "this result is illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : charge_halo ] , where we plot the charge density as a function of the radial coordinate @xmath73 for the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 for which the net generated charge ( [ charge_generated_aharonov ] ) vanishes .",
    "one can see that while positive charge is accumulated in the region with nonzero field strength ( @xmath90 ) , the excess of negative charge is accumulated in the exterior of that region . at large distances",
    "@xmath91 , the negative charge density behaves as @xmath92 where the last expression is just the smallest fractional part of the fluxes @xmath85 .",
    "thus the charge distribution has a negative `` heavy tail '' which compensates for the positive charge accumulated in the region with nonzero field strengths .",
    "such exact compensation becomes obvious if one integrates ( [ eq : halo_ch_dens ] ) over the whole space , taking into account the normalization of the eigenmodes @xmath93 : the total charge is then just @xmath94 , which is equal to zero for field configurations under consideration ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) . in order to better illustrate the existence of this heavy tail , on the lower plot of fig .",

    "since at small @xmath73 the eigenfunctions ( [ eq : halo_states ] ) behave as @xmath99 , the contributions of states with @xmath100 are strongly suppressed , and one can safely extend the summation over @xmath64 in ( [ eq : halo_ch_dens ] ) to infinity .",
    "using now the asymptotic expression ( [ eq : halos_norm_lim ] ) for the normalization constants @xmath84 , we find for the charge density @xmath101 which is is precisely the charge density which can be obtained from the expression ( [ charge_generated ] ) valid in the case of uniform fields .",
    "we thus conclude that even if the system does not exchange electric charge with the environment , the charge generation still takes place due to spatial charge separation , and for sufficiently large fluxes @xmath85 the charge density in the center of a region with nonzero field strength is given precisely by ( [ charge_generated ] ) .",

    "it is interesting to note that in this case the charge density has a dip in the center ( although remaining positive for @xmath122 ) .",
    "this dip emerges due to the suppression of the densities of eigenstates with large @xmath64 by a factor proportional to @xmath123 . in the case of uniform fields this contribution conspired with the gaussian envelope to make the distribution uniform . here",
    ", however , the envelope is not gaussian and the effects of modes with @xmath124 is to create a dip in the center of the region with nonzero strength of isospin magnetic field @xmath11 . the mode with @xmath125 , which is monotonically decreasing with @xmath73 , still creates a finite charge density at @xmath102 , but this contribution becomes smaller as compared to the contribution of higher modes at intermediate values of @xmath73 .",

    "again , since @xmath128 , the excess of positive charge around @xmath102 must be compensated by a negative charge density at large @xmath73 , which decays as ( [ charge_dens_asymptotics ] ) . in order to illustrate this slow decay of negative charge density , on the second plot on fig .",

    "let us demonstrate now how the described phenomenon can be realized in graphene , a two - dimensional hexagonal crystal lattice of carbon atoms .",
    "the dispersion relation of valence electrons in graphene has two zeros - the dirac points @xmath131 and @xmath132 .",

    "the low - energy excitations in both valleys can be described as dirac fermions @xcite , which couple to magnetic fields in the usual way . however , by applying mechanical strain in certain directions one can also induce a pseudo - magnetic field which has opposite signs for the two valleys , but does not distinguish between particles and holes ( playing the role of anti - particles ) @xcite .",

    "then we should also introduce the `` valley '' chemical potential @xmath134 , so that the two valleys have different numbers of charge carriers in them . a practical method which can be used to generate valley currents ( and thus imbalance in valley populations in some part of the sample ) by cyclic application of strain and",
    "chemical potential has been discussed recently in @xcite .",
    "note that in contrast to the general derivation given above , the degeneracies of the lowest landau levels in such a setting are given by @xmath135 and the chemical potential couples to @xmath0 rather than to @xmath136 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : levels_shift_graphene ] , top panel ) , but the principle by which the charge is generated is the same .",
    "namely , now the lowest landau levels for particles and holes in the valley @xmath131 are populated .",
    "again , the level degeneracies for particles and holes in this valley are different and given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively .",

    ", such charge density can be easily measured using modern experimental methods such as scanning tunnelling spectroscopy .",
    "again we can invert the mechanism of charge accumulation : if instead of the valley chemical potential the ordinary chemical potential is nonzero , the lowest landau levels will only be populated for particle states in both @xmath131 and @xmath132 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : levels_shift_graphene ] at the bottom .",
    "the degeneracies of these levels are given by @xmath44 and @xmath139 .",

    "estimating the value of charge density in the valley pumping device of @xcite as @xmath141 ( the ratio of the estimated `` valley charge '' per pumping cycle to a typical area of the device ) , we see that for @xmath142 the magnetically induced valley asymmetry is much larger .",
    "thus the described phenomenon can be also potentially useful for applications in ( at present hypothetical ) valley - based electronics @xcite .",
    "we note that the possibility of breaking the symmetry between the two valleys due to combined effect of mechanical strain and magnetic field has also been discussed in @xcite , but the possibility of charge catalysis was not considered .",
    "in qcd , we associate the isospin quantum number with the color of quarks , and the isospin magnetic field with the chromomagnetic field . the external magnetic field will then change the degeneracies of energy levels in different color sectors , as in eq .",
    "( [ charge_generated ] ) . recently",
    ", it was demonstrated that this difference of level degeneracies leads to the appearance of nonzero electric dipole moment in the background of topologically nontrivial configurations of non - abelian gauge fields @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of the `` color chemical potential '' , which would be required to produce electric charge in this situation , is clearly prohibited by gauge invariance .",
    "still , the weights of different landau levels in the partition function can be different for different color sectors if the gauge field configuration in the euclidean path integral representation of the thermal partition function has a nontrivial non - abelian holonomy ( polyakov loop ) @xmath143 around the compact euclidean time direction @xmath144 } $ ] . here",

    "<S> we describe a generic mechanism by which a system of dirac fermions in thermal equilibrium acquires electric charge in an external magnetic field . to this end </S>",
    "<S> the fermions should have an additional quantum number , isospin or color , and should be subject to a second magnetic field , which distinguishes the isospin / color , as well as to a corresponding isospin chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the latter can be also played by a nontrivial holonomy ( polyakov loop ) along the euclidean time direction . </S>",
    "<S> the charge is accumulated since the degeneracies of occupied lowest landau levels for particles of positive isospin and anti - particles of negative isospin are different . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two physical systems , where this phenomenon can be realized . </S>",
    "<S> one is monolayer graphene , where the isospin is associated with two valleys in the brillouin zone and the strain - induced pseudo - magnetic field acts differently on charge carriers in different valleys . </S>",
    "<S> another is hot qcd , for which the relevant non - abelian field configurations with both nonzero chromo - magnetic field and a nontrivial polyakov loop can be realized as calorons - topological solutions of yang - mills equations at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the induced electric charge on the caloron field configuration is studied numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that due to the fluctuations of holonomy external magnetic field should tend to suppress charge fluctuations in the quark - gluon plasma and estimate the importance of this effect for off - central heavy - ion collisions . </S>"
