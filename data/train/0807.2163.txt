    "let @xmath4 be a graph with edge set @xmath5 and vertex set @xmath6 .",
    "we require that the graph is finite and connected .",
    "it may sometimes have loops and/or multiple edges ; if these are not allowed the graph is called simple .",
    "let @xmath7 be the vertex degree of @xmath8 , where we note that a loop at vertex @xmath9 contributes @xmath10 to its degree .",
    "we shall only need the edge degree @xmath11 for simple graphs @xmath4 , where it is defined as the number of edges meeting @xmath12 in either of its endpoints . note that this is equivalent to the vertex degree of @xmath12 in the line graph @xmath13 of @xmath4 .",
    "denote by @xmath14 the combinatorial distance between vertices @xmath15 .",
    "the universal cover @xmath16 of any graph @xmath4 is a tree with vertex set @xmath17 and edge set @xmath18 .",
    "it can be constructed as follows : choose a root vertex in @xmath4 , let the vertex set of @xmath16 be the set of non - backtracking paths in @xmath4 starting at the root vertex , and define two such paths to be neighbours if they differ by exactly one edge at the end ( see @xcite , p833 ) .",
    "the projection map @xmath19 then associates a vertex @xmath20 with the terminal vertex in @xmath6 of the path it represents , and an edge in @xmath18 from @xmath21 to @xmath22 is mapped to the edge in @xmath5 by which the paths @xmath21 and @xmath22 differ . if we are now given a real function @xmath0 on the vertices @xmath6 ( or edges @xmath5 ) of @xmath4 , we can lift it uniquely to a function @xmath3 on the vertices ( edges ) of the universal cover via @xmath23 .",
    "we define a vertex sphere @xmath24 on @xmath16 . the edge sphere is defined analogously as @xmath25",
    "the _ spherical mean _ of the function @xmath0 on the vertices or the edges is now defined as @xmath26 where we replace @xmath27 by @xmath28 in the edge case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study the asymptotic behaviour of these averages as @xmath29 for particular types of graphs , before looking at some other averages .",
    "we use an analogy between hyperbolic surfaces and regular graphs which has been studied by various authors ( see e.g.  the preface of @xcite ) .",
    "the problem studied by gnther @xcite in the continuous case translates to the case of the regular graph , where we obtain the following result :    [ reg v ] let @xmath4 be a nonbipartite regular connected graph of degree @xmath30 and @xmath31 a function on its vertices .",
    "then we have for any basepoint @xmath32 @xmath33 here @xmath34 is a constant depending on @xmath4 but independent of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 with lowest value @xmath37 for ramanujan graphs .",
    "obviously , this implies that @xmath38 for any @xmath39 .",
    "the norm @xmath40 comes from the inner product @xmath41 .",
    "we exclude bipartite graphs in this theorem because spheres of even and odd radii can have different limiting behaviour in this case - see section [ other ] for details .",
    "we shall see in the proof that @xmath42 depends on the spectral gap - recall that ramanujan graphs are graphs with a large spectral gap ( see e.g.  @xcite or @xcite ) .    [ arc ] the proof of theorem [ reg v ] can be modified for averages over increasing circular arcs on @xmath16 .",
    "a straightforward argument then allows us to use the result for arcs to prove convergence on increasing subsets of _ horocycles _ as defined by cartier in @xcite .",
    "see section [ other ] for more details .",
    "the next result is concerned with functions defined on the edges of a regular graph .",
    "[ reg e ] let @xmath4 be a regular connected simple graph with @xmath43 and let @xmath44 be a function on its edges .",
    "then we have for any basepoint @xmath32 @xmath45 here @xmath34 is a constant depending on @xmath4 but independent of @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "note that it is not possible to use theorem [ reg v ] to prove theorem [ reg e ] ( and [ semihom ] below ) by looking at the corresponding line graph @xmath13 for two reasons : the spheres on @xmath13 do nt correspond to our edge spheres , and @xmath46 .",
    "( recall that the vertices of @xmath13 correspond to the edges of @xmath4 , and two vertices in @xmath13 are connected by an edge if the corresponding edges in @xmath4 have a vertex in common ) .",
    "finally , we look at _ semiregular _ graphs , which are connected bipartite graphs where every edge connects a vertex of degree @xmath47 to one of degree @xmath48 , so that the edge degree is constant at @xmath49 . we shall only consider functions on the edges of this type of graph , as the vertex case will be treated in section [ other ] when we deal with bipartite graphs .",
    "[ semihom ] let @xmath4 be a semiregular simple graph with edge degree @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , and let @xmath44 be a function on its edges .",
    "then we have for any basepoint @xmath32 @xmath45 here @xmath34 is a constant depending on @xmath4 but independent of @xmath35 , and @xmath51 .",
    "note that theorem [ semihom ] only deals with bipartite graphs , whereas theorem [ reg e ] holds for any graph , so it is not a special case of theorem [ semihom ] .",
    "we need @xmath50 in this theorem , as @xmath52 can give a non - converging function on the graph - see the example in figure 2 on @xmath53",
    ". taking the top left vertex as @xmath35 , we find the spherical average takes the values @xmath54 for increasing @xmath55 , and does nt converge .",
    ": dashed edges have function value @xmath2 , others have function value @xmath56.,height=113 ]    before we turn to the proofs of the above theorems and discuss further results , let us briefly explain how spherical means are related to non - backtracking random walks ( nbrw ) . this is a topic which has been investigated thoroughly in recent years and is the subject of active current research .",
    "nbrw have been studied in the context of cogrowth , although there is a subtle difference between the way we calculate our average and the method used for nbrw . in the latter case ,",
    "one calculates the probability with which a non - backtracking path in @xmath4 with starting point @xmath8 and length @xmath57 will terminate at a vertex @xmath58 ; this is calculated for all @xmath58 , and the resulting probabilities can be used as weights in calculating the average of a function @xmath0 on the vertices .",
    "however in our case all non - backtracking paths are counted with the same weight , which in the case of non - regular graphs gives a different average .",
    "the concept of cogrowth on graphs was first introduced in the context of groups and their cayley graphs .",
    "this was studied in the early 1980s by grigorchuk @xcite , cohen @xcite and woess @xcite . in the 1990s",
    "the application of cogrowth was extended to arbitrary graphs , see for example northshield @xcite or bartholdi @xcite .",
    "we define the growth of the tree @xmath16 by @xmath59 and the cogrowth of the graph @xmath4 by @xmath60 both of which are independent of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 .",
    "then the cogrowth constant is @xmath63 .",
    "more recently , ortner and woess @xcite generalised the definition of cogrowth and used it to study nbrw .",
    "they set @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a sequence of probability measures concentrated on the sphere @xmath66 , subject to some regularity conditions .",
    "choosing particular measures we obtain cogrowth or nbrw probabilities , which coincide in the case of a regular graph . in this case the results in their paper prove convergence of our spherical mean , however without giving information on the convergence rate , in contrast to the methods used in this article .",
    "in fact although various authors have investigated the spectrum of the non - backtracking adjacency matrix , which is related to the poles of the ihara zeta function ( see e.g.  @xcite , @xcite ) , they have not related this to the convergence rate of the spherical mean as defined here .",
    "the convergence of a _ simple _ random walk ( which allows backtracking ) on a finite @xmath67-regular graph @xmath4 is discussed in @xcite , where the authors find that the probability distribution of the random walk converges to the uniform distribution by a factor @xmath68 at each step , where @xmath69 is the modulus of the largest nontrivial eigenvalue of the vertex adjacency matrix of @xmath4 .",
    "they also find the lowest value of @xmath70 appears iff @xmath4 is ramanujan .",
    "however this random walk allows backtracking , so we can not use this result in the case of spherical means , as the paths that define the vertices of @xmath16 do not allow backtracking .",
    "we start by discussing theorem [ reg v ] , namely the case of a function on the vertices of a connected non - bipartite regular graph @xmath4 of degree @xmath30 .",
    "let @xmath71 be a function on the vertices of a graph @xmath4 .",
    "then we define the laplacian of @xmath0 at @xmath8 as @xmath72 where @xmath73 means that the vertex @xmath58 is adjacent to @xmath9 .",
    "it is related to the adjacency matrix @xmath74 of the @xmath67-regular graph via @xmath75 , which means it is a real symmetric operator with eigenvalues @xmath76 satisfying @xmath77 .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath2 occurs iff @xmath4 is bipartite , and we have excluded this case from the theorem as the result will not hold for such a graph ( precisely due to this eigenvalue ) .",
    "the simple eigenvalue @xmath56 is associated to the constant eigenfunction , so for all nonconstant eigenfunctions we now have @xmath78 .",
    "we will show that the spherical mean converges to the graph average , and then use the proof to calculate the convergence rate .",
    "there is an orthonormal basis of @xmath79 eigenfunctions @xmath80 of the laplacian , that is , @xmath81 and @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "we start by proving the convergence of spherical means for these eigenfunctions .",
    "let @xmath84 be the constant eigenfunction , and note that here the spherical mean @xmath85 clearly equals the graph average for all @xmath55 . since @xmath86 for @xmath87 , we are left to prove that @xmath88 for @xmath89 with the required speed of convergence .    for each eigenfunction @xmath90 on @xmath4",
    "let @xmath91 be its lift onto the universal covering tree @xmath16 , where it is also an eigenfunction of the laplacian , and define the _ radialisation _ of @xmath91 with respect to @xmath92 as @xmath93 where @xmath94 .",
    "@xmath95 is also an eigenfunction on @xmath16 with the same eigenvalue @xmath96 as @xmath80 , and as it only depends on @xmath57 we shall denote it @xmath97 for all @xmath9 such that @xmath98 .",
    "observe that @xmath99 .",
    "using @xmath100 we obtain a recursion relation @xmath101 the solution to which is given by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 for @xmath104 , and @xmath105 are some constants derived from the initial values @xmath106 , @xmath107 , which in turn are determined by the eigenfunction @xmath80 and the chosen basepoint @xmath35 . for @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 for some constants @xmath111 .",
    "it then just remains to check that @xmath112 and @xmath113 to show @xmath114 for @xmath87 .    for the calculation of the convergence rate",
    "we distinguish three cases :    * case @xmath115 * ( @xmath116 ) : we find @xmath117 and @xmath118 for some constant @xmath119 which originally depends on @xmath120 and @xmath121 , that is @xmath80 and @xmath35 .",
    "now there are only finitely many values of @xmath105 , because @xmath95 is the same for any lift @xmath35 of one of the _ finitely many _",
    ". therefore we can choose @xmath122 large enough so that it is independent of @xmath35 .",
    "* case @xmath108 * ( @xmath123 ) : here we have @xmath124 for some @xmath125 .",
    "choosing @xmath126 for some @xmath127 and adjusting the constant @xmath128 appropriately , we obtain @xmath129 for @xmath130 independent of @xmath35 .",
    "* case @xmath131 * ( @xmath132 ) : we find @xmath133 are both real , and at least one of them satisfies @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath135 , then @xmath136 and we have @xmath137 for some @xmath119 independent of @xmath35 .",
    "a general function @xmath31 can be written as @xmath138 and we obtain @xmath139 here @xmath140 is the convergence rate obtained from the eigenvalue @xmath141 of largest modulus as then @xmath142 ( so the larger the spectral gap of @xmath4 , the smaller @xmath140 ) . applying cauchy - schwarz",
    ", we obtain @xmath143 where @xmath144 .",
    "note that this convergence is independent of the basepoint @xmath35 , and that for ramanujan graphs we obtain @xmath145 ( or @xmath146 ) as all their eigenvalues give @xmath147 .",
    "theorem [ reg e ] concerns functions on the edges of a regular graph @xmath4 , and the method of proof follows that of the vertex case apart from a small deviation towards the end .",
    "we no longer allow the graph to have loops or multiple edges , and require @xmath148 .",
    "let @xmath149 be a function on the edges of a graph @xmath4 .",
    "then the ( edge ) laplacian of @xmath150 at @xmath151 is defined as @xmath152 where @xmath153 means that the edge @xmath154 is adjacent to @xmath12 in the sense that it has a vertex in common with @xmath12 ( note that this is equivalent to taking the vertex laplacian on the line graph @xmath13 of @xmath4 ) .",
    "we find that here the range of eigenvalues of the edge laplacian is smaller , namely @xmath155 , as for any line graph the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix are no less than @xmath156 , see @xcite .",
    "the recurrence relation now looks as follows @xmath157 once again we want to show for @xmath158 that @xmath114 . for @xmath159",
    "we find again that @xmath102 , where this time @xmath160 and for @xmath108 we have @xmath110 .    for @xmath161",
    "the proof now follows that of the vertex case .",
    "note that @xmath131 for @xmath162=i$ ] , where @xmath163 and @xmath164 . as functions of @xmath76 ,",
    "@xmath133 are both monotone on @xmath165 and @xmath166 $ ] , because @xmath167 does nt change sign in either interval .",
    "calculating @xmath168 for boundary values of @xmath169 gives @xmath170 , except @xmath171 ( which corresponds to the constant funtion ) and @xmath172 .",
    "however theorem 3 in @xcite states that any eigenfunction on the edges of a graph with eigenvalue @xmath156 ( which corresponds to @xmath173 ) must have @xmath174 , where @xmath175 means that @xmath35 is either the initial or terminal vertex of the edge @xmath12 .",
    "but this is equivalent to saying that @xmath176 . observing that @xmath177 we find @xmath178 , which means the spherical average of the corresponding @xmath80 converges to zero as required .",
    "this completes the proof of the fact that the spherical mean of functions on the edges of @xmath4 converge to the graph average . to find the convergence rates we work completely analogously to the vertex case in theorem [ reg v ]",
    "finally we discuss our third theorem , the case of functions on the edges of a simple semiregular graph with edge degree @xmath49 , where we require that @xmath50 . as for theorem [ reg e ] ,",
    "we reduce the problem to looking at the radialisation of nonconstant eigenfunctions of the edge laplacian , which now has eigenvalues @xmath179 . recall that edge circles are centred on a vertex , and we shall assume this vertex has degree @xmath47 .    because @xmath4 is semiregular",
    ", there is a more complicated recursion formula for the radialised eigenfunction @xmath180 with eigenvalue @xmath76 on the edges of the universal covering tree @xmath16 , given by @xmath181 @xmath182 hence @xmath183 .",
    "the convergence properties of the spherical average are now determined by the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath184 , which are @xmath185 @xmath186    it turns out below that the convergence of the spherical mean can only fail if we have @xmath96 such that @xmath187 or @xmath188 ( see formulas ( [ 1 ] ) and ( [ 2 ] ) below ) .",
    "therefore we investigate @xmath189 for all possible @xmath96 , and we distinguish the cases @xmath190 and @xmath191 .    for @xmath147",
    "we have @xmath192 which means the spherical average converges as required . when @xmath131 we look at the various regions of @xmath76 for which @xmath131 separately .",

    "the second eigenvalue @xmath211 is more problematic .",
    "if we have @xmath212 such that the root @xmath213 is imaginary , we obtain @xmath214 for all @xmath76 ; but when @xmath215 and @xmath216 are such that it is real , we choose @xmath217 and derive that @xmath218 ( solved as before ) , @xmath214 for @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 for @xmath222 .",

    "<S> in 1966 , p.  gnther proved the following result : given a continuous function @xmath0 on a compact surface @xmath1 of constant curvature @xmath2 and its periodic lift @xmath3 to the universal covering , the hyperbolic plane , then the averages of the lift @xmath3 over increasing spheres converge to the average of the function @xmath0 over the surface @xmath1 . in this article </S>",
    "<S> , we prove similar results for functions on the vertices and edges of regular and semiregular graphs , with special emphasis on the convergence rate . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider averages over more general sets like arcs , tubes and horocycles . </S>"
