    "for the last ten years , dramatic progress has been made in the investigation of low dimensional quantum gases  @xcite . when quantum gases are confined to one or two dimensions , the role of quantum correlations",
    "is strongly enhanced and the physics changes qualitatively  @xcite .",
    "for example , one - dimensional bosons behave as fermions in the tonks - girardeau regime  @xcite , or a homogeneous bosonic gas restricted to two dimensions undergoes a specific transition to a superfluid state described by the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless theory ( bkt )  @xcite , below a critical temperature .",
    "while one - dimensional quantum gases have been investigated experimentally some time ago  @xcite , experimental results have been obtained more recently with two - dimensional quantum gases , including the observation of the bkt phase  @xcite and the measurement of the equation of state  @xcite . in many respects ,",

    "long range order is destroyed , but the correlation function decreases algebraically which preserves a partial coherence on finite size systems  @xcite .",
    "moreover , interacting two - dimensional gases in a harmonic trap present a scale invariance  @xcite which is at the origin of the absence of damping of the breathing mode  @xcite .",

    "all the experiments which achieved this regime  @xcite made use of dipole traps  @xcite to strongly confine the atoms in one direction .",
    "the drawback of dipole traps is that , even if spontaneous photon scattering can be avoided by the use of high power and large detunings  @xcite , pointing stability remains an issue for long time scale experiments  @xcite .",
    "moreover , light scattered by the windows of the vacuum chamber or any other surface close to the atoms may lead to interferences with the main light field and induce local defects in the trapping potential  @xcite .",
    "these defects are detrimental to experiments requiring a high smoothness of the trapping potential , or a high degree of control on the application of a tailored disorder  @xcite . on the other hand , macroscopic magnetic traps give access to smoothly varying potentials . in this paper",

    "any high frequency spatial noise is filtered out and the fields seen by the atoms vary smoothly , in a very well controlled way .",

    "while the rf frequency is very well known , the rabi coupling experienced by the atoms can be measured _ in situ _ with a resolution of 0.5  khz by rf spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "the number of atoms remaining in the dressed trap is recorded as a function of the frequency of a second , weak , rf field , which induces resonant spin flips to an un - trapped dressed state when its frequency is equal to the rabi coupling @xmath100 at the position of the atoms , see for example figure  [ fig : dressfreqz](b ) . in our setup",

    "the horizontal oscillation frequencies can also be determined by exciting the dipolar oscillation and recording directly the in - plane cloud position as a function of time , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : dipole ] for another set of trap parameters .",
    "this measurement confirms the very small anisotropy .",
    "moreover , the dipolar oscillation can be monitored for half a second without detecting any damping  @xcite .",
    "this feature reveals the excellent harmonic character of the dressed quadrupole trap .",
    "another remarkable feature of this trap is the low heating rate and the long lifetime which can be achieved .",
    "we recorded the total number of atoms in the cloud as a function of time .",
    "the lifetime is limited by the background gas collisions to more than 200s for a rabi coupling above 20  khz .",
    "we also measured the number of atoms in the coherent central peak .",
    "the lifetime of the degenerate gas , recorded in the presence of an rf - knife 200  khz above the trap bottom , reaches 10s and is limited by three - body losses .    in the same experimental conditions , the heating rate is as low as 4  nk@xmath84s@xmath109 .",
    "it can be attributed to a small amplitude noise  @xcite of the fields produced by the two independent antennas , responsible for a heating of 2  nk@xmath84s@xmath109 each .",
    "these figures depend on the rabi coupling between magnetic states . at very small values of the rabi coupling",
    ", landau - zener transitions may occur and limit the lifetime .",
    "we observe a reduction in the lifetime of thermal atoms for rabi frequencies below 20  khz for a magnetic gradient of 55.4  g@xmath84@xmath85 .",
    "we expect that the lifetime will be lower with a larger magnetic gradient .",
    "for the whole set of data presented in this paper , the lifetime is always above 20  s. the issue of lifetime in dressed traps has been addressed in part in refs .",
    ". however , quantitative comparisons with experiments , in both the cases of thermal atoms and quantum degenerate gases , would require further theoretical and experimental studies .",
    "as demonstrated in the previous sections , the dressed quadrupole trap is naturally oblate with a large anisotropy . in the horizontal plane",
    ", it is very well described by an harmonic potential .",
    "moreover , it exhibits a very long lifetime and a low heating rate . in this section , we show that we are able to compress the gas in the vertical direction up to very large values of the anisotropy and to reach the two - dimensional regime for the trapped quantum gas .",

    "the rf - coupling @xmath112 slightly changes during this procedure , due to the frequency dependence of the amplifier gain .",
    "a spectroscopic measurement in the compressed trap at 2.336  mhz gives a smaller value of @xmath108  khz , which contributes to increasing the vertical frequency further , see figure  [ fig : dressfreqz](b ) . in these conditions",

    "we can infer the total atom number , the temperature , the coherent fraction and the density profiles .",
    "the cloud after expansion exhibits a bimodal distribution .",
    "the coherent fraction is extremely anisotropic : its density profile has a thomas - fermi parabolic shape in the horizontal directions whereas it exhibits a gaussian shape in the vertical direction , which is a consequence of the confinement to the ground state in the vertical direction .",

    "our data agree well with the model taking into account the interactions .",

    "the vertical displacement of the trap centre induced by this frequency sweep is slow compared to the vertical confinement frequency and the atoms follow adiabatically .",
    "however the subsequent change in @xmath127 is not adiabatic with respect to the in - plane dynamics : the gas is then placed in an out - of - equilibrium state where its radius is smaller than the equilibrium one . since during this procedure the trap cylindrical symmetry is preserved , this results mainly in an excitation of the monopole mode , see figure  [ fig : monopole ] .",

    "this shows that the quality factor @xmath130 , ratio of the monopole angular frequency to the damping rate , exceeds 150 . the current experimental resolution does nt allow for a search for the quantum anomaly , which is at the level of @xmath131 for our trap parameters  @xcite",
    "furthermore , the quantum anomaly shift will be masked , at the @xmath132 level , by beyond two - dimensional effects originating from a finite value of the ratio @xmath133  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the study of the quadrupole mode .",
    "this mode consists in out - of - phase oscillations of the cloud radii along two orthogonal directions . in our experiment ,",
    "the thermal gas is always in the collisionless regime .",
    "this implies that , while the breathing mode also exists at a frequency @xmath134 for the thermal gas , the quadrupole mode can only be observed when a superfluid fraction is present . in order to excite this mode",
    ", we must break the cylindrical symmetry of the trap and induce an anisotropy in the trap potential .",
    "this is done by switching the rf - dressing to another configuration where both antennas are driven in phase to produce the dressing field .    in this situation ,",
    "the rf field is linearly polarized along a direction @xmath135 at 45 degrees between @xmath89 and @xmath25 .",
    "the degeneracy of the in - plane trapping frequency is lifted , according to eq .",
    ", see appendix .",
    "the in - plane anisotropy can be increased either by reducing the bubble radius @xmath24 or by increasing the rabi coupling .",
    "we chose to reduce @xmath24 by tuning the rf frequency to 1  mhz while keeping the rabi coupling constant to keep the same vertical oscillation frequency . in these conditions",
    ", we are able to load degenerate samples with almost no thermal fraction .",
    "the temperature estimated from the trap depth is 50  nk . the clouds exhibit an in - plane anisotropy of 1.2 , as revealed by in - situ imaging , see figure  [ fig : quadrupole](b ) . by monitoring small in - situ",
    "dipolar oscillations of the cloud , we measure the two trap frequencies : @xmath136  hz and @xmath137  hz , consistent with the cloud radii . in this anisotropic trap ,",
    "the expected frequency for the quadrupole mode , derived from a castin - dum analysis  @xcite adapted to two dimensions , is @xmath138    hz .",
    "( b ) : in situ ( 1 ms time of flight ) imaging of the gas density profile by a home made objective ( magnification @xmath139 , resolution @xmath140 m ) , with probe propagating along @xmath3 . in order to reduce the optical thickness only about 10% of the atoms are pumped on the cycling transition before the imaging pulses .",
    "the density profile exhibits a bimodal shape with a coherent central feature well described by a thomas - fermi profile on top of a larger gaussian pedestal . ]",
    "the excitation of the quadrupole mode in this trap proceeds as follows .",
    "the gas is initially at rest in the symmetric trap with circularly polarized dressing field .",
    "we then rapidly change the relative phase between the two antennas , from @xmath90 to @xmath141 in 0.4  ms , thus going to the final situation where the dressing field is linearly polarized and the trap is anisotropic .",
    "the initial values of the cloud radii do not correspond to equilibrium in this new trap configuration , one being larger and the other being smaller , which results in out of phase oscillations of the radii at constant cloud volume .",
    "we observe these oscillations by measuring the cloud in - plane anisotropy as a function of time : this quantity oscillates at the quadrupole mode frequency , as shown in figure  [ fig : quadrupole](a ) .",
    "we measure a quadrupole mode frequency of @xmath142  hz in good agreement with the prediction of @xmath143  hz , deduced from eq .  .",
    "in summary , we have demonstrated for the first time the confinement of a quantum gas to two dimensions in a magnetic trap .",
    "magnetic traps are very stable , and are not subject to photon scattering or short scale defects as can occur if scattered light is present . moreover , the trap frequencies are in excellent agreement with those predicted from the simple knowledge of the magnetic gradient and rf characteristics , making the trap geometry well under experimental control .",
    "we have shown that the trap is indeed extremely smooth , sustaining dipole oscillations for about one second .",
    "this trap is very well suited for the study of collective modes of a quantum gas .",
    "we present data for the monopole and quadrupole mode , in a regime of low temperature .",
    "for this two - dimensional gas , dependence of the mode frequencies on temperature or on the two - dimensional parameter @xmath133 are expected  @xcite but , up to date , very few experimental data have been published for the bosonic case  @xcite .",
    "a shift in the monopole mode frequency , in particular , is a signature of the equation of state . in turn",
    ", the equation of state depends on a transverse mean field shift  @xcite , or on subtle quantum effects  @xcite",
    ". a systematic study of these frequency shifts will be the subject of future work .",
    "we consider here a linearly polarized rf field @xmath144 = b'_1\\cos(\\omega_{\\rm rf}t)\\,\\mathbf{e}_{y'}$ ] along a direction @xmath135 in the @xmath99 plane making an angle @xmath145 with @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath146 . the orthogonal direction in the plane is labeled @xmath147 , with @xmath148 .",
    "we now define @xmath112 as the maximum rf amplitude at the bottom of the isomagnetic ellipsoid , @xmath149 .",
    "the effective rabi coupling depends on * r * as @xmath150 the dressed quadrupole trap now has three non degenerate frequencies along the axes @xmath147 , @xmath135 and @xmath3 .",
    "the oscillation frequencies are deduced from a second order expansion of the trapping potential around its minimum .",
    "the result is as follows  @xcite :        with the same equilibrium position @xmath24 , given at eq .  .",
    "the oscillation frequency in the @xmath147 axis depends on @xmath112 only through @xmath24 , because the rabi coupling is uniform in the whole @xmath152 plane where the static magnetic field is orthogonal to the rf polarization everywhere .",
    "we acknowledge institut francilien de recherche sur les atomes froids ( ifraf ) for support .",
    "we thank paolo pedri and maxim olshanii for helpful discussions and fabrice wiotte for technical assistance with rf sources .",
