    "the most elementary and standard way to solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation is to express the initial wave function in terms of the eigenfunctions and write the solution as a sum of and/or an integral over the corresponding eigensolutions oscillating with the corresponding frequencies .",
    "this method is appropriate to investigate the revival behaviour @xcite which is a pure quantum phenomenon that occurs in many quantum systems at late times .",
    "but in order to get information about details of the wave packet dynamics including the transition from classical to quantum mechanics taking place much earlier than the revival phenomenon the eigenstates have to be summed up numerically @xcite,@xcite .",
    "moreover there are cases such as the finite square well where the energy eigenvalues @xmath0 are only given implicitly @xcite , which complicates the summation .",
    "an alternative route is the feynman path integral that contains the classical action and seems to be a good candidate for the study of quasiclassical behaviour .",
    "but even attempts to simplify the path integral via semiclassical approximations such as the gutzwiller trace formula @xcite or the method of cellular dynamics @xcite still lead to involved expressions . moreover evaluating these semiclassical formulas one can never be sure how long they are a good approximation for the exact behaviour of the wave function .",
    "so the question arises wether there is something in between the brute force method of summing up eigenstates and entering the world of path integrals . for the infinite square",
    "well a third possibility is known .",
    "the so - called mirror solution @xcite consists of a sum of free particle solutions , describing a wave packet ( particle ) being reflected from one wall to the other .",
    "this solution is achieved by just considering the special symmetry of the problem and making a successful guess .",
    "so it would be desirable to have a method to derive such intuitive solutions also for more general problems .",
    "the method of laplace transform that we will introduce gives the exact solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation when the solution of the stationary equation is known . for our purpose",
    "it is not necessary to identify the eigenvalues .",
    "instead the laplace transformed schrdinger equation contains the initial wave packet as an inhomogeneous term which allows to apply the method of variation of constants .",
    "the solution is then given in terms of the initial wave packet .",
    "the only technical difficulty is to perform the inverse laplace transform .",
    "here we can use the toolbox of rules and inversion formulas , provided for instance in @xcite,@xcite .    though the technique of laplace transformation has been applied to several specific problems concerning the time dependent schrdinger equation ( see below ) , the proposed method has not yet been consequently used and explored as a tool to solve the initial value problem of wave packet evolution .    in @xcite and",
    "@xcite the laplace transform was used to determine a perturbative solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation with the help of an eigenfunction expansion of the unperturbed hamiltonian . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the laplace transform was applied to problems with time dependent boundary conditions .",
    "@xcite,@xcite explored the late time behaviour of special initial wave functions for tunneling phenomena .",
    "both authors required the identification of complex poles of the laplace transformed solution which brings back a problem of similar difficulty as the identification of eigenvalues and makes the solutions less explicit .",
    "what comes closer to the proposed method is the derivation of the propagator @xmath1 from the green function which means to invert the half - sided fourier transform ( @xcite , @xcite ) @xmath2 since this integral can in general not be expected to converge this implies a regularization @xmath3 .",
    "this makes the laplace transform favorable , where such a procedure is not needed and the existing inversion formulas can be applied .",
    "we start by introducing the method in section [ method ] . in section [ isw ]",
    "we show that we can reproduce the mirror solution of the infinite square well in a straightforward way .",
    "we proceed with the potential step in section [ ps ] .",
    "the derivation of the exact solution in this case is significantly easier than the derivation of the propagator in @xcite,@xcite where the pdx method for path integrals was applied .",
    "apart from being of similar simplicity as the most explicite solutions available in the literature ( @xcite,@xcite ) the obtained solutions admit a direct insight into the wave packet dynamics . we show directly that sufficiently peaked wave packets with energy higher than the potential step will be slowed down as a corresponding classical particle which was already derived in @xcite using the saddle point approximation .",
    "and we investigate the wave packet behaviour in the classically forbidden region for wave packets with energy lower than the energy of the step .",
    "we are able to derive an exact result for the reflection probability in terms of the transmission coefficient of the time independent solutions ( [ finding ] ) .",
    "this result confirms a conjecture in @xcite under a certain condition for the initial wave packet .    in section [ asw ]",
    "we investigate the asymmetric square well , a potential that is a combination of the two preceding ones and can be described as a box with exit .",
    "as far as we know the initial value problem of this model was not considered before .",
    "we find out that the solution is a very intuitive combination of the solutions of the infinite square well and the potential step .",
    "we show that for reasonably peaked wave packets and after not too long times the probability of a particle to be found in the box is given by powers of the reflection probability of the potential step , where the power is given by the number of reflections the wave packet has already undergone .",
    "the laplace transform @xcite @xmath4 of the wavefunction @xmath5 reads    @xmath6    here and from now on we always assume that the laplace transform of the wave function exists which is ensured if the wavefunction does not grow faster than exponentially in time .    applying the laplace transformation to the schrdinger equation    @xmath7    we find    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the initial wave function .",
    "equation ( [ wampi ] ) is an inhomogeneous linear ordinary second order differential equation for the laplace - transformed wave function @xmath4 .",
    "when two linearly independent solutions of the homogeneous equation are known a particular solution of ( [ wampi ] ) can be achieved by the method of variation of constants . with the two homogeneous solutions @xmath10 and",

    "what is left is working out the inverse laplace transformation for the specific problem .",
    "the infinite square well is a physical model system which can be interpreted as the one - dimensional description of a particle locked up by infinitely rigid walls .",

    "well , a given wave packet is reflected between the walls with the classical period corresponding to its momentum expectation value . at a certain period of motion ,",
    "a certain term of ( [ dynkb ] ) is dominant .",
    "the first term is just the free particle propagator . when the wave packet , initially located between the walls , leaves the box it will no longer yield a relevant contribution to the solution .",
    "the second term represents the free dynamics of a wave packet , that has the initial shape @xmath35 , since @xmath36 furthermore , if @xmath9 has the momentum expectation value @xmath37 , the mirrored wavefunction @xmath35 has just the opposite momentum @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , if the first term describes a wave packet moving towards the left wall , the second describes a wave packet initially located left outside the box and entering it around the time when the classical reflection takes place .",
    "so the first two terms of ( [ dynkb ] ) are the quantum version of the reflection of a classical particle at the left wall .",
    "similarly , each term can be given a certain meaning in terms of classical dynamics .",
    "if the initial wave packet moves towards the right wall , the term ( [ reflection ] ) becomes negligible , and another term of ( [ dynkb ] ) will be responsible for the description of the first reflection at the right wall .",
    "for each of the subsequent reflections there will be two relevant terms describing the reflection process .",
    "these terms coincide with the exact solution for a wave packet reflected at a single infinite wall which was already investigated in detail ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) . as time progresses , of course the spreading of wave packets increases and the semiclassical picture is no longer correct .",
    "out next model system is the potential step , described by the potential    @xmath39    the evolution of the wave packet @xmath40 , is determined by    @xmath41    where @xmath5 is supposed to be continuously differentiable . the solution will be square integrable for all times , if the initial function is chosen square integrable .",

    "the second term represents the reflected wave packet and has the form of a wavepacket reflected at an infinite wall ( see also the description at the end of the last section ) , deformed by a convolution .",

    "moreover , if the initial function is reasonably peaked the second term of ( [ stufekn ] ) does not become relevant until the wave packet approaches the barrier .",
    "so the approximation can always be used when    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the time , a classical particle corresponding to the wave packet would need to reach the barrier .",
    "the solution for the region @xmath56 , then reads @xmath67    since the integral ( [ approx ] ) is itself a laplace integral , we can apply ( [ koeffizient ] ) and find for @xmath68    @xmath69=-1 + 2 k-2 \\sqrt{k(k-1 ) }   \\quad \\mbox{with } \\quad k=\\frac{p^2}{2 m v}\\,.\\ ] ]    this function coincides with the reflection coefficient of the time independent solution ( see for instance @xcite ) .    defining the reflection probability as @xmath70 we are now able to show that @xmath71 if the momentum expectation value @xmath37 of the initial wavepacket is positive .",
    "the first term of ( [ stufeknm ] ) describes the free time evolution of the wavepacket @xmath72 . for positive momentum expectation values",
    "we find @xmath73 this result can be derived by determining the correction that has to be applied to a free wave packet solution with @xmath74 if the expectation value changes to @xmath75 .",
    "so only the second term of ( [ stufeknm ] ) which describes the reflected wave packet contributes @xmath76 where @xmath77",
