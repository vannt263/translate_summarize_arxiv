    "considering the overall grounds we may expect that the theory of general relativity and quantum theory can be unified in the form of the standard model of particle physics at the planck energy scale .",
    "however , this unification requires quantizing gravity , which results in very fundamental difficulties .",
    "one of these difficulties is related to the energy of the fundamental vacuum state and the other concerns the status of lorentz invariance .",
    "the fuzzy nature of space - time in quantum gravity may lead to violations of this fundamental symmetry . during the last two decades theoretical studies and experimental observation of lorentz invariance violation",
    "have received a lot of attention @xcite .",
    "one possible consequences of lorentz invariance violation is energy dependent photon propagation velocities .",
    "the energy dependence can be constrained by recording the arrival times of photons of different energies emitted by distant objects at approximately the same time @xcite .",
    "one feature of lorentz invariance violation to be considered is that the speed of light differs from that in special relativity . according to gravity theories with lorentz violation ,",
    "the speed of graviton or the speed of gravitational wave differ from that in general relativity [ see e.g.@xcite ] .",
    "studying the speed of gravitational wave in a lorentz violating gravity theory will provide different perspectives on quantum gravitational phenomena .    of promising theories dealing with gravity in recent years",
    "are the brane - world scenarios , offering a phenomenological way to test some of the novel predictions and corrections to general relativity that are implied by the m - theory . in such models",
    ", it is usually assumed that @xmath1 is a universal constant .",
    "alternatively , approaches where the speed of gravitational waves can be different from @xmath1 in a brane - world context have also been considered , see@xcite . it should be emphasized that the assumption that the maximal velocity in the bulk coincides with the speed of light on the brane should not be taken for granted . in this",
    "regard , theories with two metric tensors have been suggested with the associated two sets of  null cones \" , in the bulk and on the brane @xcite .",
    "this is the manifestation of violation of the bulk lorentz invariance by the brane solution . in some brane - world scenarios ,",
    "the space - time globally violates @xmath0 lorentz invariance , which results in apparent violations of lorentz invariance from the brane observer s point of view due to bulk gravity effects .",
    "these effects are restricted to the gravity sector of the effective theory while the well measured lorentz invariance of particle physics remains unaffected in these scenarios @xcite .    in this paper , we focus attention on the einstein field equations on the brane obtained through the well known sms procedure @xcite and address the question of the speed of propagation of gravitational waves in the bulk as well as on the brane .",
    "we find a relation between the maximum velocity in the bulk and the speed of light on the brane .",
    "next , we compare the red shift experienced by gravitational waves traveling in the bulk with that of the electromagnetic waves on the brane and show that they are different .",
    "we find the signature of the extra dimension which would provide a possible detection mechanism in gravitational wave experiments , thus clarifying the maximal velocity in the bulk .",
    "if it turns out that the extra dimension is space - like , then we expect the lorentz violation effects manifest themselves in gravitational wave experiments .",
    "in the usual brane - world scenarios the space - time is identified with a singular hypersurface ( or 3-brane ) embedded in a five - dimensional bulk .",
    "suppose now that the background manifold @xmath2 is isometrically embedded in a pseudo - riemannian manifold @xmath3 by the map @xmath4 such that @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the metric of the bulk ( brane ) space @xmath7 in arbitrary coordinate , @xmath8 is the basis of the bulk ( brane ) and @xmath9 is normal unite vector , orthogonal to the brane . since @xmath9 is a vector field along the extra dimension , we can introduce @xmath9 as follows @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a scalar field .",
    "the perturbation of @xmath12 with respect to a small positive parameter @xmath13 along the normal unit vector @xmath9 is given by @xmath14 the integrability conditions for the perturbed geometry are the gauss and codazzi equations .",
    "the perturbation ( [ eq2c ] ) induces a perturbation on the metric @xmath15 which can be written as @xmath16 in particular , the linear perturbation obtained from the expansion in @xmath13 is @xmath17 to find the perturbed metric , we follow the same definitions as in the geometry of surfaces .",
    "consider the embedding equations of the perturbed geometry written in the particular gaussian frame defined by the embedded geometry and the normal unit vector @xmath18 substituting equation ( [ eq2c ] ) in ( [ eq5c ] ) , we may express the perturbed metric in the gaussian frame defined by the embedding as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the extrinsic curvature of the original brane and the metric of our space - time is obtained at @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "using equations ( [ eq2 ] ) , ( [ eq5c ] ) and ( [ eq6c ] ) , the metric of the bulk is written as @xmath23 where we have used the signature @xmath24 everywhere .",
    "the five - dimensional einstein equations contain the first and second derivatives of the metric with respect to the extra coordinate .",
    "these can be expressed in terms of geometrical tensors in @xmath0 .",
    "the first partial derivatives can be written in terms of the extrinsic curvature @xmath25 the second derivatives can be expressed in terms of the projection @xmath26 of the bulk weyl tensor to 5@xmath27 @xmath28b}- ^{(5)\\!\\!\\!}r_{b[c}g_{d]a}\\right)\\ \\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{1}{6}\\left(^{(5)\\!\\!}r g_{a[c}g_{d]b}\\right).\\label{eq14}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the absence of off - diagonal terms @xmath29 the dimensional reduction of the five - dimensional equations is particularly simple @xcite .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 . with the brane - world scenario in mind , for deriving the einstein field equations on the brane it is assumed that the five - dimensional energy - momentum tensor has the form @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the cosmological constant in the bulk and @xmath37 is the energy - momentum tensor of the matter on the brane with @xmath38 and @xmath39 in the spirit of the brane world scenario , we assume @xmath40 symmetry about the brane , considered to be a hypersurface @xmath41 at @xmath21",

    "it is usually separated in two parts , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the tension of the brane in @xmath48 , which is interpreted as the vacuum energy of the brane world and @xmath49 represents the energy - momentum tensor of ordinary matter in @xmath0 . using equations ( [ eq35 ] ) and ( [ eq38 ] )",
    ", we obtain the einstein field equations with an effective energy - momentum tensor in @xmath0 as @xmath50 where @xmath51    all these @xmath0 quantities have to be evaluated in the limit @xmath52 .",
    "they give a working definition of the fundamental quantities @xmath53 and @xmath54 and contain higher - dimensional modifications to general relativity .",
    "also , to obtain the equations of gravitational waves in the bulk , first we assume that the bulk space is empty .",
    "using equation ( [ eq6c ] ) , the metric of the perturbed brane can be written as fallow @xmath55 where @xmath56 is a small parameter . by using the einstien gauge ,",
    "the equations of gravitational waves become @xmath57 since @xmath58 is related to the energy - momentum tensor on brane @xmath59 by junction conditions , so we can conclude these waves are generated by ordinary matter on the brane .",
    "in this section , we want to obtain a relation between the maximal velocity of propagation in bulk and on the brane .",
    "let us start by assuming a perfect fluid configuration on the brane .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is therefore written as @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the unit velocity , energy density and pressure of the matter fluid respectively .",
    "we will also assume a linear isothermal equation of state for the fluid @xmath64 the weak energy condition @xcite imposes the restriction @xmath65 .",
    "in this paper we deal with non - tilted homogeneous cosmological models on the brane , _",
    "i.e. _ we are assuming that the fluid velocity is orthogonal to the hypersurfaces of homogeneity .",
    "in standard cosmological models , we can also consider @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "next , we take the metric for our @xmath0 universe as @xmath67 with coordinates @xmath68 and the 3-metric @xmath69 on the spatial slices of constant time . now , using the israel s junction condition , we have @xmath70 , \\",

    "\\label{eq49}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from ( [ eq46 ] ) , we see that the constant @xmath73 represents the speed of light on the original brane , whereas from ( [ eq47 ] ) the speed of the propagation of gravitational waves on the @xmath0 section of the bulk is @xmath74 .",
    "now , in a brane world scenario where our universe is identified with a singular hypersurface embedded in an @xmath75 bulk , the extra dimension has to be space - like @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath27 is always greater than unity @xmath76 .",
    "this leads to apparent violations of lorentz invariance from the brane observer s point of view due to bulk gravity effects , since the maximal velocity in the bulk becomes more than the speed of light on the brane .",
    "it is worth noting that if the energy density of the matter fluid on the brane is zero , we obtain @xmath77 , implying that the maximal velocity in bulk will be the speed of light on the brane .",
    "on the other hand , this issue may lead to a modified dispersion relation for propagating modes of gravitational waves .",
    "thus , we should construct a parameterized dispersion relation that can reproduce a range of known lorentz violation predictions .",
    "also , we can investigate its effects on how these waves propagate . in this regard ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "an interesting analogy exists between the behavior of gravitational waves propagating into the bulk from the brane and the electromagnetic waves crossing one medium into another with different indexes of refraction .",
    "this is a reflection of fermat s principle where the greater speed achieved by gravitational waves in the bulk is taken advantage of when such waves bend slightly into the bulk with the result that they arrive earlier than electromagnetic waves do , the latter being stuck to the brane .",
    "therefore , gravitational waves traveling faster than light would be a possibility .",
    "these faster than light signals , however , do not violate causality since the apparent violation of causality from the brane observer s point of view is due to the fact that the region of causal contact is actually bigger than what one would naively expect from the ordinary propagation of light in an expanding universe , with no closed timelike curves in the @xmath78 spacetime that would make the theory inconsistent @xcite .",
    "as the present day observations of distant objects involve red shifted spectra , knowing the behavior of the red shift of different waves is necessary for analyzing data . in this section",
    ", we compare the red shift of gravitational waves in the bulk with that of the electromagnetic waves on brane . in doing",
    "so we consider the usual flrw line element on the brane with @xmath79 as scale factor .",
    "therefore , the red shift of electromagnetic waves on the brane is obtained by the usual formula @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the detected and emitted wavelengths , respectively .",
    "on the other hand , using equations ( [ eq47 ] ) , ( [ eq49 ] ) , the red shift of gravitational waves on brane is given by @xmath83 now , the ratio of the red shift of the gravitational waves to that of the electromagnetic waves is @xmath84 and thus depends on the function @xmath85 . to study the variation of the ratio with time , it is necessary to know the time variation of @xmath62 and @xmath86 . from",
    "( [ eq36 ] ) and ( [ eq38 ] ) it follows that @xmath87 for the perfect fluid ( [ eq44 ] ) , this is equivalent to @xmath88 @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the expansion , @xmath91 is the acceleration and @xmath92 is the projector onto the spatial surface orthogonal to @xmath93 . in homogeneous cosmological models , equation",
    "( [ eq54 ] ) becomes redundant and only equation ( [ eq53 ] ) is relevant .",
    "for the case of the constant vacuum energy @xmath94 and equation of state @xmath95 , it yields the familiar relation between the matter energy density and expansion factor @xmath96 @xmath97 for the case where the vacuum energy is not constant , we need some additional assumption . we know that the time variation of @xmath54 is usually written as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the present observational upper bound is @xmath100 @xcite . in what follows",
    "we assume that @xmath99 is constant . since @xmath101 and @xmath102 , we have @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is a constant of integration . from equation ( [ eq53 ] )",
    "we thus find @xmath105 first , we consider the case where @xmath62 can be expressed in @xmath96 , similar to ( [ eq55 ] ) , i.e. as a power of @xmath96 .",
    "we therefore find @xmath106 , and @xmath107 where @xmath108 is a positive constant . in order to simplify the notation we set @xmath109 and @xmath110 which gives @xmath111 with this notation we now have @xmath112 note that one may take @xmath113 and that @xmath114 @xmath115 , otherwise @xmath116 .",
    "we also have @xmath117 before going any further , we should be aware of observational bounds on @xmath118 .",
    "the lower bound comes from the obvious requirement @xmath119 , while the upper bound comes from the observation that @xmath120 .",
    "thus , @xmath121 the next step would be to find the function @xmath122 .",
    "in standard cosmological models , we can set @xmath123 .",
    "the physical condition @xmath124 then puts a lower limit on @xmath125 , namely @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "therefore , we find @xmath85 as @xmath127\\ \\nonumber\\\\ & \\simeq&\\left[1-\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}k_{5}^{2}y\\phi_{0}\\rho_{0}(1+\\gamma ) \\left(\\frac{a}{a_{0}}\\right)^{r-3(\\beta+1)}\\right],\\label{eq63}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath128 now , if the extra dimension is space - like , @xmath84 is less than unity and so the red shift due to gravitational waves is smaller than that of the electromagnetic waves . on the other hand ,",
    "if the extra dimension is time - like , @xmath84 is greater than unity . then , the red shift of gravitational waves is greater than that of the electromagnetic waves .",
    "since the red shift of gravitational waves is different from that of the electromagnetic waves , this issue may have effects on the detection of gravitational waves .",
    "for instance , through the process of finding a correlation between the small scale cmb polarization fluctuations and the galaxy number density at a given red shift , one can determine the local quadrupole moments of the cmb at that red shift .",
    "then , considering these quadrupoles at different patches on the sky and at different red shifts , one can obtain a map of the quadrupole moments during the reionization era @xcite .",
    "a small part of this quadrupole pattern can be produced by the tensor modes of fluctuations , _",
    "i.e. _ , gravitational waves . using the correlation between galaxy distribution and the cmb polarization anisotropies",
    ", we can constrain the strength of the primordial gravitational waves which are really important to physicists , see also @xcite . since the red shift of gravitational waves is different from that of electromagnetic waves ,",
    "one expects the strength of primordial gravitational waves to be modified .",
    "in this paper we have considered a brane - world scenario where the einstein field equations on the brane were obtained using the usual sms formalism . based on this scenario we then showed that within the framework of the standard cosmological models , the red shift associated with gravitational waves moving through the bulk is not equal to the red shift of electromagnetic waves propagating on the brane .",
    "such a difference could be used , in the event of the detection of gravitational waves , to find the signature of extra dimension .",
    "this should clarify the question of the maximal velocity in the bulk space .",
    "we also showed that if the extra dimension is space - like , the @xmath0 lorentz invariance in the gravitational sector is broken in the sense of having a propagation speed greater than that of light .",
    "gauge fields will not feel these effects , but gravitational waves are free to propagate into the bulk and they will necessarily feel the effects of the variation of the speed of light along the extra dimension .",
