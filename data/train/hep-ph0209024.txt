    "<S> we briefly summarize the outcomes of our recent improved fits to the experimental data of ccfr collaboration for @xmath0 structure function of @xmath1 deep - inelastic scattering at the next - to - next - to - leading order . </S>",
    "<S> special attention is paid to the extraction of @xmath2 and the parameter of the infrared renormalon model for @xmath3-correction at different orders of perturbation theory . </S>",
    "<S> the results can be of interest for planning similar studies using possible future data of neutrino factories .    </S>",
    "<S> the most precise up to date data for @xmath1 deep - inelastic scattering cross - sections were provided in 1997 by ccfr collaboration @xcite . in view of the necessity of understanding of the place of different theoretical effects in the fits to @xmath0 non - singlet structure function data , interesting from the point of view of possible future theoretical program of neutrino factories ( for a review see ref.@xcite ) </S>",
    "<S> , it is worth to summarize some basic results of the most recent higher - order perturbative qcd analysis @xcite , which updates the results of the previous similar studies of refs.@xcite,@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is based on the jacobi polynomial technique of reconstruction of the structure function from its mellin moments @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 are the jacobi polynomials , @xmath7 contain @xmath8 and @xmath9 euler @xmath10-functions with the jacobi polynomial parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 fixed following the detailed studies of ref.@xcite .    the moments @xmath13 contain the leading order target mass correction , while the contribution of higher terms of order @xmath14 do not affect the results of the fits @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will fix the dynamical non - perturbative corrections using infrared renormalon ( irr ) model as @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 was calculated from the single chain of one - fermion loop insertions into the one- gluon contribution to the born diagram in ref.@xcite and @xmath18 is the arbitrary fitted parameter .    </S>",
    "<S> the mellin moments obey the following renormalization - group equation @xmath19\\frac{c_{f_3}^{(n)}(a_s(q^2 ) ) } { c_{f_3}^{(n)}(a_s(q_0 ^ 2))}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 , while @xmath21 is the phenomenological quantity , defined at the initial scale @xmath22 as @xmath23 .    </S>",
    "<S> the main new ingredient of the analysis of ref.@xcite comes from the recent results of analytical calculations of next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) correction to @xmath24 at odd @xmath25 @xcite ( the nnlo corrections to @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath27 @xcite were already known for quite a long time ) . </S>",
    "<S> the switch from the nnlo non - singlet contributions to @xmath28 at n=2,4, .. ,10 calculated in ref.@xcite , which numerically are closely related to the identical contributions to @xmath24 , and were used in the previous nnlo fits of ccfr97 data of refs.@xcite,@xcite , is making our new analysis more self - consistent . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that in spite of fixation of the number of previously existing theoretical ambiguities , our new fits are confirming the main results of ref.@xcite , putting them on more solid ground .    in order to save space </S>",
    "<S> , we will avoid discussions of the number of technical steps of the analysis of ref.@xcite and will concentrate ourselves on the presentation of the main physical results .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table 1 . * the results of the fits to the ccfr97 @xmath0 data with @xmath29 with related statistical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the cases of different @xmath22 are considered . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath30 are given in mev , while @xmath18 is `` measured '' in gev@xmath31 .    in table 1 </S>",
    "<S> we present the results of the fits taking into account leading order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and nnlo perturbative qcd corrections . </S>",
    "<S> due to the incorporation of the recently calculated nnlo corrections to @xmath32 @xcite into our new nnlo fits of ref.@xcite the nnlo fitted parameters turn out to be rather stable to the variation of @xmath22-scale from 20 gev@xmath31 , used in ref.@xcite , to the lower initial scale @xmath33 gev@xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed , that the tendency @xmath34 demonstrates the minimization of the role of the power corrections for the description of @xmath0 data . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , at the nnlo the value of the irr model parameter @xmath18 is effectively minimized and within statistical uncertainties is comparable with zero . </S>",
    "<S> this property was already observed in the process of our previous nnlo analysis of ccfr97 data @xcite and in the nnlo fits to the combined data of slac , nmc and bcdms collaboration for @xmath35 structure function of deep - inelastic scattering of charged leptons on nucleons @xcite.in all these fits the qcd coupling constant was closed to its world average value @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in our analysis of ref.@xcite we got @xmath37 @xmath38 the latter result agree , within errors , with the results of the nnlo fits to ccfr97 data , performed with the help of bernstein polynomial technique using different theoretical representations ( compare the original publication of ref.@xcite with the recent work of ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , that if one gets the `` small '' nnlo value of @xmath2 , namely @xmath39 , like in the work of ref.@xcite , the @xmath3 contributions to @xmath35 remain visible even at the nnlo @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we can conclude , that there is some correlation between twist-4 terms and nnlo perturbative qcd corrections and nnlo value of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> one can hope , that the possibility to detect higher - twist terms at the nnlo will be clarified in future using drastically more precise data for @xmath35 and @xmath0 structure functions , which can be obtained at neutrino factories in the lower @xmath40-region .    * </S>",
