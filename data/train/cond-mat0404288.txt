    "the interest of the condensed matter community in cluster physics has been recently revived due to exciting technological possibilities offered by new materials in which clusters play the role of basic `` building blocks '' ( see e.g. ref .",
    "theoretical investigations of model clusters , i.e. assemblies of particles interacting via binary ( mostly lennard - jones ) potential has a long history @xcite .",
    "most studies performed so far have concentrated on the search of the most stable configuration of @xmath0 particles .",
    "typically , total potential energy of a cluster is written as a sum over binary interactions of all pairs of particles within the cluster .",
    "then , a search for a set of coordinates ( or configuration of the cluster ) which minimize the potential energy is performed @xcite .",
    "depending on the number of particles within a cluster , very different cluster shapes can be obtained following this procedure @xcite .",
    "the approach just sketched can require formidable numerical optimization procedures @xcite .",
    "however , it is completely classical since it produces an absolute minimum in the potential energy , rather than the energy of a ground quantum state of the system which must be smaller in absolute value .",
    "the difference between the two values is the ( quantum ) zero - point energy of the cluster .",
    "the clusters investigated in this article are known as closed shell clusters .",
    "these appear for `` magic values '' of @xmath0 , and the specific sequence to be investigated here is @xmath1 .",
    "the characteristic sequence of `` magic '' numbers has also been observed experimentally ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) . closed shell clusters of interest to the present article appear in two configurations , icosahedral and cuboctahedral ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "these clusters can be thought of as being assembled by adding closed `` shells '' of atoms to a single atom located at the origin , i.e. the center of the cluster .",
    "the thus `` assembled '' structure can be characterized with the maximum shell number @xmath2 ( see fig . [",
    "fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the two types of clusters have quite different geometries , but their common feature is that they have the same number of atoms for the given maximum shell number @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this is a very convenient feature which enables a direct comparison of the various physical properties of such clusters @xcite .",
    "cuboctahedral clusters can also be visualized as pieces of a crystal with face - centered - cubic ( fcc ) packing .",
    "a fcc crystal can be obtained from cuboctahedral clusters in the limit of infinite shell number .",
    "the same is not true for icosahedral clusters which are therefore `` noncrystal '' @xcite .",
    "closed shell icosahedral configuration has been shown to have lower total potential energy for clusters smaller than about 9000 particles @xcite . the actual number of particles ( or the shell number ) @xcite above which cuboctahedral clusters have lower potential energy has been a subject of debate ( see e.g. refs .",
    "this is not important for the purpose of this article since i am going to consider relatively small clusters ( up to nine shells or 2869 atoms ) for which icosahedral configuration is a classically preferred one .",
    "a plausible reason for the fact that the closed shell icosahedral ( csic ) configuration is classically more stable from the closed shell cuboctahedral ( csfcc ) configuration is that the arrangement of particles which are on the cluster surface is `` tighter '' in the csic than in the csfcc ordering of the cluster ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "the aim of this article is twofold .",
    "first , a detailed microscopic calculation of cluster vibrations shall be performed , depending on the closed - shell cluster size .",
    "it is of interest to see whether the different cluster geometries reflect themselves in the cluster vibrational properties .",
    "the differences in vibrational properties could be exploited to discriminate between the different cluster geometries .",
    "some early studies @xcite have dealt with the vibrational frequency spectra of clusters , but these studies were limited to quite small clusters and there were no attempts to compare the vibrational spectra pertaining to clusters with the different symmetries .",
    "the results should also be relevant to the studies of vibrations in nanoparticles deposited on substrates @xcite .",
    "the second aim is to reexamine the cluster stability from the point of quantum mechanics , i.e. to investigate the differences between the csic and csfcc clusters with respect to their quantum ground state energy and temperature dependent vibrational entropy .",
    "the quantum approach is quite easy in the case in which the cluster dynamics can be adequately represented by harmonic vibrations , but it should be kept in mind that such treatment is adequate only for sufficiently low temperatures .",
    "this is the region of temperatures that is of interest to this article .",
    "there are several points that come to mind regarding the second aim .",
    "first , one could assume that the fact that the surfaces of csfcc clusters are less densely packed implies that their characteristic vibrations will be `` softer '' , i.e. of lower frequency .",
    "thus , zero - point energy of csfcc clusters could be expected to be smaller , and the shift of the ground state energy from absolute minimum of the potential energy lesser than in csic clusters .",
    "this would suggest that quantum ground state energy may even be larger ( in absolute units ) in csfcc clusters , which would promote them to thermodynamically preferred configurations of @xmath0 atoms at zero temperature , @xmath3 k. second , even if the zero - point energy is not sufficiently different in the two cases , in order to find the thermodynamically preferred configuration at finite temperature one should minimize free energy of the system . as the cluster free energy depends on the features of the cluster vibrational spectrum and temperature",
    ", it may happen that at some finite temperature , @xmath4 , the free energy of the csfcc configuration becomes smaller than the free energy of csic configuration , even if its ground state , binding energy was smaller than in the csic configuration .",
    "third , as vibrational frequencies depend on the mass of particles in the cluster , @xmath5 , quantum effects and thermodynamical considerations must be mass dependent .",
    "classically , the cluster stability considerations depend only on the binary interaction potential .",
    "thus , any two clusters composed of different isotopes of the same element will always have the same configuration .",
    "obviously , this needs not be the case in a quantum treatment and quantum effects are going to be larger for clusters composed of lighter particles .",
    "this article aims at examining the three points mentioned above .",
    "the results of the article are not directly applicable to real clusters , although the model of the cluster adopted could be used to describe noble gas clusters and could serve as a point of departure for setting up more complex interaction models @xcite .",
    "there are some reservations , however , since it is known that the form of the binary potential employed in calculation can influence the cluster optimal shape and its dynamical properties @xcite .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in section [ sec : sec1 ] , i shall briefly describe the adopted theoretical approach ( quantum quasiharmonic approximation ) .",
    "section [ sec : sec2 ] deals with the model clusters in which the particles interact via lennard - jones binary potentials .",
    "vibrational spectra of csic and csfcc clusters are calculated for shell numbers between two ( 55 atoms ) and nine ( 2869 atoms ) .",
    "the effects of mass and temperature on the helmholtz free energy of clusters are considered on the example of clusters of ne , ar and xe atoms .",
    "section [ sec : sec3 ] summarizes and concludes the article .",
    "the dynamical behavior of a cluster is described by a set of coordinates @xmath6 which are treated as time dependent variables .",
    "the particles within the cluster are assumed to interact via a binary potential , @xmath7 , which depends only on their relative positions , i.e. @xmath8 . the total potential energy of the cluster , @xmath9 is assumed to be given by a summation of binary interactions over all the pairs of particles in the cluster , @xmath10 where the dependence of the potential energy on the cluster configuration has been emphasized .",
    "the configuration of a cluster which minimizes the potential energy function can be denoted by a set of coordinates @xmath11 which denote mean , static positions of the @xmath0 particles within the cluster .",
    "assuming that @xmath12 , i.e. that the displacements of particles from their equilibrium positions are small , one can expand the total potential energy of the cluster in the taylor series up to the second order as , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote the cartesian components ( @xmath16 , and @xmath17 ) of the vectors .",
    "the first derivatives of @xmath9 with respect to atom coordinates are assumed to vanish , i.e. the cluster is assumed to be in a minimum potential energy configuration .",
    "this is the well known harmonic approximation and it serves as a starting point for the calculation of the cluster normal modes of vibration @xcite , i.e. a set of linear combinations of @xmath18 variables ( or eigenmodes ) , each of which corresponds to a vibration of the system with a single frequency @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the problem when written in terms of normal mode coordinates represents a set of independent harmonic oscillators whose both quantum and classical dynamics are well known .",
    "there are @xmath19 such oscillators with characteristic frequencies @xmath20 .",
    "six degrees of freedom that do not represent vibrations are three rotations and three translations of the whole system .",
    "once a set of eigenfrequencies is calculated , one can proceed to calculate the helmoltz free energy of the cluster , @xmath21 , which is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath24 is temperature , and @xmath25 is the quantum partition function of a system of @xmath19 independent oscillators . in terms of the eigenmode frequencies , one can write @xcite @xmath26 , \\label{eq : free2}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the minimum of classical potential energy of the cluster ( classical ground state energy ) , and @xmath28 is the reduced planck constant . the sum of the first two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free2 ] ) represents the quantum ground state energy of the cluster , @xmath29 , calculated in the harmonic approximation .    at constant temperature",
    ", the state which represents thermodynamical equilibrium of the system is the one which minimizes the helmholtz free energy @xcite .",
    "note that even at zero temperature , the cluster free energy has a quantum , zero - point energy contribution [ second term in eq.([eq : free2 ] ) ] , in agreement with the ideas put forth in the introduction .",
    "thus , even at zero temperature , the thermodynamical equilibrium state of the cluster need not be the same as the state which minimizes the classical potential energy of the cluster @xcite .",
    "this of course depends on the nature of particles in the system , their mass in particular as is known from the studies of systems of he atoms @xcite .",
    "in order to perform a normal vibrational mode calculation , one first has to find the set of coordinates @xmath11 which make the functional @xmath9 stationary in the @xmath30-dimensional configurational space .",
    "if the normal mode calculation were performed in a nonstationary configuration , some of the normal mode frequencies would turn out imaginary .",
    "this would signify the instability of the cluster structure @xcite .",
    "the atoms were assumed to interact via binary lennard - jones 6 - 12 potentials , @xmath31,\\ ] ] and were initially arranged in a configuration which has the symmetry of either cuboctahedral or icosahedral cluster with the nearest - neighbor atom distances set close to the lennard - jones range parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the thus obtained initial configuration was then allowed to relax to a configuration in which the forces acting on each of the atoms in the cluster were smaller than some predefined and arbitrarily small absolute force . to obtain the relaxed configuration ,",
    "each of the atoms in the cluster was displaced a certain distance in the direction of the total force acting on it .",
    "this was repeated until the absolute value of the force averaged over all cluster atoms dropped below predefined force @xmath33 . in each step of this iterative procedure ,",
    "the lengths of vectors the atoms were moved along were reduced or enlarged , depending on the vectorial characters of forces in a given and preceding step acting on a particular atom .",
    "apparently similar relaxation algorithms were used in refs .",
    "the value of @xmath33 used in the calculations presented below was @xmath34 @xmath35 , except for the @xmath36 csfcc cluster for which @xmath37 @xmath35 was used .",
    "for smaller values of @xmath33 , the algorithm used relaxes the cluster of @xmath36 csfcc initial symmetry to the @xmath36 csic configuration . whether this signifies instability of csfcc @xmath36 cluster ,",
    "as is the case for @xmath38 csfcc cluster @xcite , or is simply a manifestation of inability of the algorithm to reach presumably shallow and/or narrow minimum in the configurational space , is not clear and is of limited importance to this work - the @xmath36 csfcc cluster was treated as stable and the calculation of vibrations has been performed .",
    "it suffices to say that the potential energy obtained for @xmath36 csfcc cluster in this study agrees perfectly with the result of the previous study @xcite ( see table [ tab : tab1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it is also of interest to note that the results of refs .",
    "@xcite also indicate the instability of @xmath36 csfcc cluster .",
    "the classical potential energies of the clusters , @xmath39 obtained using the procedure explained in the previous paragraph are displayed in table [ tab : tab1 ] for closed - shell clusters with maximum shell number @xmath2 .",
    "these energies depend only on @xmath40 , and this was used as a scale for @xmath39 . the minimum nearest neighbor distance within the cluster , @xmath41",
    ", is also displayed .",
    ".classical potential energies ( @xmath39 ) in units of @xmath40 and minimum nearest neighbor distances ( @xmath42 ) in units of @xmath32 of lennard - jones icosahedral and cuboctahedral closed - shell clusters . the maximum cluster shell number is denoted by @xmath2 , and total number of atoms in the cluster by @xmath0 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : tab2 ]    these results are to some extent surprising .",
    "although both the minimum and maximum frequency are smaller in the csfcc clusters , the first moments of their frequency spectra are _ larger _ than in corresponding csic clusters , at least for the cluster shell numbers between 2 and 9 studied here .",
    "one can visually inspect that this is indeed so by looking again at the panel denoted by @xmath43 in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "this means that quantum ground state energies differ more than ( classical ) potential energies of the clusters .",
    "thus , icosahedral closed shell clusters are even more preferred energetically when the quantum nature of the particles is important ( in the cases when one can speak about the ordered ground state , when the approach presented here is adequate ) . to illustrate this effect and estimate its magnitude for clusters composed of rare gas atoms , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] i plotted the difference between the classical potential energies of csic and csfcc clusters [ @xmath44(csic)@xmath45(csfcc ) , full circles ] and the difference between the quantum ground state energies [ @xmath46(csic)@xmath45(csfcc ) + @xmath47(csic)@xmath48(csfcc ) , empty diamonds ] as a function of cluster shell number @xmath2 , and for clusters composed of ne , ar , and xe atoms .",
    "these quantities can not be obtained for general lennard - jones clusters in some reduced units of energy since the classical potential energy scales with @xmath40 , while the zero - point energy scales with @xmath49 .",
    "the lennard - jonnes parameters used in this calculation were @xmath50 mev , @xmath51  , @xmath52 mev , @xmath53  , @xmath54 mev , @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "this produces characteristic frequency scales @xmath56 mev , @xmath57 mev , and @xmath58 mev .",
    "the classical results ( full circles ) are practicaly the same as those obtained in fig . 2 of ref .",
    "it is obvious that quantum corrections become more important for lighter atoms .",
    "even for xe clusters , their effect is not negligible , especially when the differences between the csic and csfcc clusters are considered .",
    "intriguingly enough , the relative importance of quantum effects increases with the shell number .",
    "the behavior of free energy with temperature is such that the differences between the csic and csfcc free energies increase in absolute value as the temperature increases .",
    "this means that at finite temperatures , the csic structure is even more favored than at @xmath3 k. the behavior of the sum of second two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : free2 ] ) , @xmath59 , \\label{eq : f1}\\ ] ] with temperature is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] for @xmath60 csfcc ( full line ) and csic ( dotted line ) clusters .",
    "similar behavior is found for all @xmath2 s examined in this work .",
    "the main result of this article is that quantal treatment of the low temperature properties of 2 to 9 shell csic and csfcc lennard - jones clusters results in a larger binding energy of csic clusters .",
    "the difference between binding energies of csic and csfcc clusters is larger than in classical treatment @xcite .",
    "this results is somewhat surprising in the view of expectations put forth in the introduction .",
    "it is plausible , although not shown in this article , that the presented quantal treatment would yield a quantum binding energy `` crossover '' between the csfcc and csic clusters for larger shell numbers than obtained classically ( 14 ) , i.e. that the csfcc arrangement of clusters would become energetically favorable for larger clusters than predicted previously @xcite . on the basis of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] it can be expected that the exact number of atoms for which the crossover takes place is dependent on the mass of atoms in the cluster .",
