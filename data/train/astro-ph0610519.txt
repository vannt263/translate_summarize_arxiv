    "the cosmological constant @xmath4 has a fairly long history of acceptance and rejection due to its peculiar properties and behaviour .",
    "historically , it was first proposed by einstein  @xcite as repulsive pressure to achieve a stationary universe for his theory of general relativity .",
    "but , later on , theoretical work of friedmann  @xcite without cosmological constant and observational result of hubble  @xcite with galactic law of red - shifts - all did indicate towards an expanding universe paradigm .",
    "this situation forced einstein to abandon the concept of introducing @xmath4 in his gravitational field equations .",
    "thus what was rejected by einstein the same was embraced by friedmann and hubble .",
    "this is the first phase for its weird history of ups and downs in the first quarter of nineteenth century .",
    "however , the debate went on with its non - existence and even existence .",
    "actually zeldovich  @xcite in his most innovative way revived the issue of cosmological constant @xmath4 by identifying it with the vacuum energy density due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "therefore , people started thinking about @xmath4 once again with a new outlook .",
    "if it does exist then what are the features and implications of it on the physical systems are available in these review articles  @xcite .",
    "following all these what we are really interested to mention here that survival of cosmological constant @xmath4 was occurring slowly and getting gradually a strong theoretical footing .",
    "however , the resurrection came in a bold way through the observational evidence of high redshift type ia supernovae  @xcite for a small decreasing value of cosmological constant ( @xmath5 ) at the present epoch .",
    "it is now commonly believed by the scientific community that via cosmological constant a kind of repulsive pressure , _ dark energy _",
    ", is responsible for this present state of accelerating universe .",
    "this is because of the fact that the @xmath4-cdm model agrees closely with all most all the established cosmological observations , the latest being the 2005 supernova legacy survey ( snls ) . according to the first year data set of snls _ dark energy",
    "_ behaves like the cosmological constant to a precision of @xmath6 per cent  @xcite .",
    "obviously , this small decreasing value of cosmological constant indicates that instead of a strict constant then @xmath4 could be a function of space and time coordinates or even of both .",
    "it is , therefore , argued that the solutions of einstein s field equations with variable @xmath4 will have a wider range and the roll for scalar @xmath4 viz . ,",
    "@xmath0 , in astrophysical problems in relation to the nature of local massive objects like galaxies , will be as much significant as in cosmology  @xcite . in this line of approach",
    ", the field equations including variable @xmath4 have been solved in various cosmological situations ( i.e. @xmath7 ) as well as astrophysical situations ( i.e. @xmath0 ) by several workers  @xcite .",
    "now , string theory being a major tool for understanding nature involving physical systems a string theoretic approach towards astrophysical and cosmological realm thought to be useful from the very beginning of the advent of the theory .",
    "letelier  @xcite studied the spherical symmetric gravitational field produced by a bunch of strings by replacing the motion of dust clouds and perfect fluids in terms of string clouds and string fluids .",
    "later on vilenkin  @xcite proposed a model of a universe composed of string clouds .",
    "einstein field equations have also been solved by several workers from string theoretic point of view for a single cosmic string  @xcite , two moving straight strings  @xcite and @xmath8 straight strings moving on a circle  @xcite .",
    "dabrowski and stelmach  @xcite considered friedman universe filled with mutually noninteracting pressureless dust , radiation , cosmological constant and dense system of strings .",
    "there are also several other very recent models where the concepts of string have been considered , e.g. , rolling tachyon from the string theory  @xcite , a string - inspired scenario associated with a rolling massive scalar field on d - branes  @xcite , exotic matter , either in the form of cosmic strings or struts with negative energy density also has been considered in connection to the matter content of an additional thin rotating galactic disk  @xcite and a fluid of strings along with the cosmological constant , as a candidate of dark energy , has considered by capozziello et al .",
    "@xcite to get a viable scenario of the present status of the universe .",
    "so , it is not unnatural to investigate the effect of space - variable @xmath4 on an anisotropic static spherically symmetric source composed of string fluid . therefore , the present investigation is the generalization of the work of tiwari and ray  @xcite with string fluid replacing perfect fluid .",
    "the main purpose of the investigations are : firstly , to search for some kind of link between the approaches with matter and string theoretic one ; secondly , interrelationship , if exist , between the string and cosmological constant ; and thirdly , to find out the extra features which appear due to the inclusion of varying cosmological constant in string fluid .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 the general relativistic einstein field equations are presented where the cosmological constant and string fluid are included in the energy - momentum tensors .",
    "section 3 deals with their solutions in various cases and subcases under this modified theory of general relativity .",
    "we include two sections 4 and 5 regarding solar system and effective attractive correction to the newtonian force due to cosmic string density admitting varying @xmath4 .",
    "some salient features of the present model are discussed in the concluding section  6 .",
    "the einstein field equations are given by @xmath9 where in relativistic units both @xmath10 and @xmath11 of @xmath12 are equal to @xmath13 .",
    "here , we shall assume the cosmological constant @xmath4 to be space - varying , i.e. , @xmath14 .",
    "it is to be noted here that the left hand side of the einstein field equations express the geometrical structure of the space - time whereas the right hand side is the representative of the matter content .",
    "we have , therefore , purposely put the non - zero @xmath4 term in the right to make its status as physical one such that the conservation law in the present case takes the form as follows  @xcite @xmath15    let us consider a spherically symmetric line element @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the metric potentials and are function of the space coordinate @xmath19 only , such that @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "now , if we assume that ( 1 ) the fluid source is a perfect fluid of finite - length straight strings and ( 2 ) the individual strings do orient themselves in a perfectly radial direction , then the energy - momentum tensors reduce to @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for both the angular coordinates @xmath24 and @xmath25 related to the metric ( 3 ) . in this context",
    "it is to be noted here that the above assumptions are quite relevant to the results of gott  @xcite and hiscock  @xcite that a straight ideal string has vanishing gravitational mass due to the gravitational effect of tension which exactly cancels the effect of mass .",
    "therefore , strings do not produce any gravitational force and can be thought of exactly straight and radially oriented  @xcite .",
    "now , to solve the einstein s gravitational field equations uniquely one has to specify some relationship between the energy - momentum tensors .",
    "let us , therefore , assume that the transverse pressure part of the string energy - momentum tensor @xmath26 is proportional to the angular part of the energy - momentum tensors @xmath27 .",
    "then , from the above equation ( 4 ) , we get @xmath28 where @xmath29 is a dimensionless constant of proportionality . this assumption ( 5 ) , as mentioned in the previous discussion , indicates the perfect radial orientation of the strings . here",
    ", however , we would like to mention that this algebraic form of energy - momentum tensors was earlier considered by gliner  @xcite and petrov  @xcite in mathematical context and later on by dymnikova  @xcite and soleng  @xcite associated with anisotropic vacuum polarization in a spherically symmetric space - time .    by virtue of the equations ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) , the field equations ( 1 )",
    "can explicitly be expressed as @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32= \\frac{8\\pi}{\\alpha } { \\rho}_s - \\lambda.\\ ] ] the above field equations , at a glance , give some clue in between the metric potentials .",
    "therefore , addition of the equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) immediately provides us the following relation @xmath33 which is equivalent to @xmath34 , between the metric potentials of the metric equation ( 3 ) . a coordinate - independent statement of this relation",
    "have been obtained by tiwari , rao and kanakamedala  @xcite by using the eigen values of the einstein tensor @xmath35 expressed in equation ( 1 ) .",
    "it is also interesting to note that @xmath36 can be expressed in terms of the energy - momentum tensors @xmath37 .    the energy conservation law , in the present situation ,",
    "is given by @xmath38 = \\frac{2}{r}\\left[{\\rho}_s + \\frac{{\\rho}_s}{\\alpha}\\right]=\\frac{\\beta}{r}{\\rho}_s\\ ] ] where @xmath39 then , from the equation ( 10 ) , we get @xmath40 which , on multiplication by @xmath41 and then integrating it , reduces to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is an integration constant .",
    "to obtain some explicit simplified results , let us investigate the field equations under the following special assumptions .",
    "let us assume that @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a proportional constant .    by the use of this assumption ( 14 ) , we get from the equation ( 13 ) @xmath47 so that the energy density can easily be obtained as @xmath48 again , on integration , equation ( 14 ) yields @xmath49 using the equations ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) we get from the equation ( 6 ) @xmath50 so that after simplification it takes the following differential form @xmath51dr.\\ ] ] the above equation ( 19 ) on integration provides the form for the metric potentials as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is an integration constant",
    ".    thus the general form of the space - time can be given by @xmath54 dt^2 \\nonumber\\\\- \\left[1-\\frac{2m}{r } - \\frac{a}{3-\\beta}r^{2-\\beta}- \\frac{b\\beta}{(1-\\beta)(4-\\beta)}r^{3-\\beta}\\right]^{-1 } dr^2 \\nonumber\\\\- r^2 ( d \\theta ^2 + sin^2 \\theta d\\phi^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      for this subcase when @xmath56 readily makes @xmath4 , via equation ( 17 ) , to be infinite and hence is not a well - defined quantity . however , for @xmath57 one can get @xmath58 for a particular choice of the values for @xmath59 and @xmath60 , therefore , equation ( 17 ) gives @xmath61 this result is similar to the one as obtained by krisch and glass  @xcite when @xmath19 is recognized as the cosmic scale factor in connection to a toroidal fluid solution embedded in a locally anti - de sitter exterior .      for this",
    ", we get from the equation ( 11 ) the value for @xmath63 as zero , which reduces the equation ( 10 ) in the form @xmath64 = 0.\\ ] ] this immediately yields @xmath65 where @xmath66 is an integration constant . hence , from the equation ( 6 ) , after integrating it and using results of ( 9 ) and ( 25 ) , we get @xmath67 from the above equation ( 26 ) we find that , for the appropriate choice of value of the constant as @xmath68 , it turns out to be schwarzschild solution .",
    "a comparison of the equations ( 20 ) and ( 26 ) , via equation ( 25 ) , immediately reveals that @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , choosing suitably the values of @xmath71 one can obtain @xmath72 this means that , even in a restricted case , vacuum energy density is dependent on cosmic string density and vice versa .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that , in the context of the inflationary cosmology  @xcite , the above relation ( 27 ) can be expressed as @xmath73 , where @xmath74 , now equivalent to @xmath75 , is the fluid pressure of string .",
    "the equation of state of this type @xmath76 with @xmath77 implies that the matter distribution is in tension and hence the matter is known , in the literature , as a ` false vacuum ' or ` degenerate vacuum ' or ` @xmath78-vacuum '  @xcite .",
    "now two cases may be considered here - + _ case i : _ when the condition is @xmath79 and @xmath80 , we get the positive energy density of string with negative vacuum energy density .",
    "we emphasize here that in the cosmological context @xmath4 positive is related to the repulsive pressure .",
    "@xmath4 being negative , as evident from the equation ( 27 ) , this case does not correspond to the present state of the accelerating universe rather it is related to a collapsing situation  @xcite .    _ case ii : _ when the condition is @xmath81 and @xmath82 , we get the negative energy density of string with positive vacuum energy density .",
    "this case of positive @xmath4 and hence negative pressure , therefore , indicates towards a state of acceleration .",
    "this positive @xmath4 as appears in the form of the negative pressure try to expand the space - time curvature in the outward direction and thus does play the role for _ dark energy _ which is responsible for the present status of the cosmic acceleration  @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted here that the concept of negative energy density of string is not unrealistic in the realm of string theory and have been extensively studied by several workers  @xcite .",
    "let us assume here that @xmath84 where @xmath85 is a constant of proportionality .    from the above assumption ( 28 ) ,",
    "after differentiating it , we get @xmath86 for which the equation ( 12 ) reduces to @xmath87 on integration this yields @xmath88 therefore , by the use of the equations ( 28 ) and ( 31 ) , we get from the equation ( 6 ) @xmath89 thus the general form of the space - time can be written as @xmath90 dt^2 \\nonumber\\\\- \\left[1-\\frac{2m}{r } - \\frac{8\\pi d_0(1+d)^2}{3 + 3d-\\beta}r^{(2 + 2d-\\beta)/(1+d)}\\right]^{-1 } dr^2 \\nonumber\\\\- r^2 ( d \\theta ^2 + sin^2 \\theta d\\phi^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      this subcase , obviously , goes back to the subcase @xmath92 for @xmath71 so that the explanation in connection to the negative string density and cosmic acceleration is also valid here .",
    "the schwarzschild vacuum solution also can be recovered here as a special case in the form given by @xmath93 dt^2 - \\left[1-\\frac{2m}{r}\\right]^{-1 } dr^2 \\nonumber\\\\- r^2 ( d \\theta ^2 + sin^2 \\theta d\\phi^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this space - time is associated with a particle of mass @xmath94 centered at the origin of the spherical system surrounded by a cloud of strings of density @xmath95 , for @xmath96 .",
    "obviously , there does not exist any string around the spherical configuration except at the points where @xmath97 . at @xmath98",
    "the string density and space - time both blow up and thus _ singularity _ arises in the solution . according to soleng  @xcite , however , this singularity at the origin is not a unique feature for string fluid model the mass being surrounded by a string fluid .      for this subcase",
    "the cosmological parameter @xmath4 vanishes by virtue of assumption ( 28 ) and hence the equation ( 31 ) reduces to @xmath100 this result can easily be recognized as the one obtained by turok and bhattacharjee  @xcite and also by kibble  @xcite where @xmath101 in their case . if we now choose @xmath102 then for this very large value of @xmath29",
    ", when @xmath103 , the equation ( 31 ) becomes @xmath104 this suggests that string - dominated universe expands more rapidly than matter- or radiation - dominated one where energy density varies , respectively , as @xmath105 and @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "this case @xmath103 and the astronomical constraint on string - dominated universe have been investigated by gott and rees  @xcite .",
    "however , dabrowski and stelmach  @xcite prefer this case @xmath103 as it corresponds to the set of randomly oriented straight strings or to the tangled network of strings which conformally stretches by expansion . according to them unlike @xmath101 this case",
    "is particularly interesting because it allows treatment of all type of components of the universe simultaneously in an analytic way and also gives some aspects of observational problems in the universe with strings .",
    "vilenkin  @xcite and soleng  @xcite also exploit this type of string cloud with energy density @xmath107 .    in this connection we are interested to point out that the present model with @xmath108 is more general than others as mentioned above and can be applicable , at least theoretically , with out any constrains like @xmath101 .",
    "another point to note here is that this result appears in the form of a solution of the einstein field equations not as an _ ad hoc _ assumption .      for this trivial case of erstwhile cosmological constant",
    ", the equation ( 13 ) becomes @xmath110 this is again the same relation ( 35 ) for @xmath111 .",
    "therefore , we can recover the relation @xmath107 from here also for @xmath112 , @xmath103 and hence the explanation of this can be made in a similar way as before .    by the use of above expression in the equation ( 6 ) the metric potential",
    "can now be given by @xmath113 thus the general form of the space - time can be written as @xmath114 dt^2 \\nonumber\\\\ - \\left[1-\\frac{2m}{r } - \\frac{\\lambda}{3}r^2 -\\frac{a}{3-\\beta}r^{2-\\beta}\\right]^{-1 } dr^2 \\nonumber\\\\ - r^2 ( d \\theta ^2 + sin^2 \\theta d\\phi^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      for this subcase we get @xmath70 and hence the equation ( 38 ) reduces to @xmath115 one can observe that for @xmath116 the above space - time becomes the schwarzschild - de sitter vacuum solution which again , in the absence of @xmath4 reduces to the schwarzschild vacuum solution as in the case of soleng  @xcite for @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively . moreover , in this case the string density becomes a constant quantity as given by @xmath119 which means that the space - time associated with the particle of mass @xmath94 is surrounded by a spherical cloud of constant string density here .      in this subcase of @xmath121",
    ", we get the metric as @xmath122 dt^2 \\nonumber\\\\- \\left[1-\\frac{2m}{r}- \\frac{\\lambda}{3}r^2 + \\frac{a}{r^2}\\right]^{-1 } dr^2 \\nonumber\\\\- r^2 ( d \\theta ^2 + sin^2 \\theta d\\phi^2).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if we now smoothly match this space - time with that of the reissner - nordstrm on the boundary of the spherical object of radius @xmath123 such that @xmath124 , then we get @xmath125 in the absence of @xmath4 . therefore , the constant @xmath126 can easily be identified with the square of the charge contained in the sphere and hence the above solution provides a reissner - nordstrm black hole surrounded by strings of fluid density @xmath127 . however , in the case of @xmath128 this turns into a reissner - nordstrm - de sitter universe  @xcite .",
    "to study the gravitational effects of cosmic string density admitting varying @xmath4 on planetary motion , we discuss the perihelion precession of planet .",
    "to find perihelion shift , we use usual geodesic equation for a massive particle ( e.g. planet ) , which can be obtained in a standard manner for the spherically symmetric metric of the form @xmath129    as  @xcite    @xmath130 ^ 2 =               \\frac{e^2}{p^2}- \\frac{f}{p^2}-   \\frac{f}{r^2}.\\ ] ]    here , @xmath131 , @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the energy and momentum of the particle respectively and over dot implies differentiation with respect to affine parameter @xmath135 .    by using @xmath136 ,",
    "the above equation takes the form as @xmath137    where ,    \\1 ) for the case 3.1 i.e. corresponding solution ( 21 ) , @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 proportional constant , @xmath143 , @xmath144 integration constant .",

    "since the planetary orbits are nearly circular , so to analyze the perihelion shift , we take a perturbation from the circular solution , @xmath157 , where    @xmath158    now we assume , @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and substitute this in equation ( 46 ) retaining to the first order in @xmath161 , we get @xmath162\\epsilon.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    from einstein s general relativity , the precession coming from the solar mass @xmath163 is    @xmath164    in addition , there is a string density ( with varying @xmath165 ) induced precession as    @xmath166    since observed perihelion shift of mercury or other planets are slightly vary with general relativistic prediction i.e. @xmath167 , so this discrepancy would be overcome due to presence of string density with varying @xmath4 in solar system . in future study",
    "one can adjust the parameters for @xmath168 percent accuracy with the experiment result .",
    "the gravitational potential can be expressed within the newtonian limit as @xmath169 and consequently the classical gravitational acceleration ( @xmath170 ) for our models are given by @xmath171 where , the parameters @xmath172 , @xmath173 , @xmath174 , @xmath175 are given as above for the three sets of solutions ( i.e. corresponding equations ( 21 ) , ( 33 ) and ( 39 ) ) .    from equation ( 51 ) , it is readily understood that one can get an effective attractive correction to newtonian force due to presence of cosmic string density admitting varying @xmath4 .",
    "it seems that our models give some clue how cosmic string with varying @xmath4 would modify newtonian as well as non - newtonian gravity in various aspects . at the same time",
    ", our models would help to solve missing mass problem ( i.e. unseen dark matter in the galaxies ) .    again , taking hubble radius ( which is of the order of @xmath176 cm ) as the value of @xmath19 it is easy to see from equation ( 23 ) that the value of @xmath4 is of the order of @xmath177 which agrees well with its present value . also by putting @xmath178 and @xmath179 in equation ( 16 ) and neglecting that the term involving @xmath180 it is easy to see that the present value of the string density @xmath181 is of the order of @xmath182 .",
    "moreover , the cosmological term and the string density are directly proportional to each other . in the case of equation ( 27 ) also @xmath4 and @xmath181 are directly proportional and the present value of the former is one order of magnitude larger than the latter .",
    "this means that depending on the signature of @xmath181 the universe will accelerate or decelerate .",
    "our three major results in the present investigations are as follows :    _ firstly _ , it is observed that variable cosmological constant has power law dependence in the form @xmath1 for a particular value for @xmath59 .",
    "this gives the toroidal fluid solution embedded in a locally anti - de sitter exterior  @xcite .",
    "_ secondly _ , it is possible to show that by the suitable choice of the values of the constants one can easily obtain the relation @xmath2 .",
    "this means that locally vacuum energy density and cosmic string density are interdependent to each other .",
    "it is already known that cosmological constant is responsible for providing repulsive pressure to the present state of accelerating universe  @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can explore the possibilities of whether there is any relation between the cosmic acceleration and cosmic string .",
    "_ thirdly _ , it is shown that cosmic string density can be scaled by a power law of the type @xmath183  @xcite .",
    "this result indicates that string - dominated universe expands more rapidly than matter - dominated universe ( @xmath105 ) or radiation - dominated universe ( @xmath184 )  @xcite .",
    "it is also observed that from the general solutions several known solutions such as the schwarzschild vacuum solution , the schwarzschild - de sitter vacuum solution , the reissner - nordstrm space - time and the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter universe can be recovered here  @xcite .",
    "however , as concluding remarks we would like to give emphasis here that only few of the above solutions seems to have some relationship with nature , the rest are interesting only from the mathematical point of view .",
    "it seems , for these few solutions with some contact with the reality , a comparison with observations would be a reasonable plan for validity of the features .",
    "therefore , we have proposed a test of our models to the solar system scales .",
    "for the same reason , it is possible to have an estimate of the string density needed to have some interesting deviations from the classical newtonian potential and how these values affect cosmological expansion .",
    "one of the authors ( sr ) would like to express his gratitude to the authorities of iucaa , pune , india and ictp , trieste , italy for providing him visiting programmes under which a part of this work was carried out .",
    "we are thankful to s. randjbar - daemi and p. creminelli , ictp , trieste , italy for helpful discussions .",
