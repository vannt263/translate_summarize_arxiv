    "several gravitational wave ( gw ) detectors are now operating around the world , including both laser interferometers @xcite and resonant mass detectors @xcite .",
    "combining the data from such a network of detectors can benefit both the detection of gw signals and estimation of signal parameters .",
    "unlike real gw signals that would occur in coincidence across all detectors in a network , most background events due to instrumental and terrestrial disturbances are expected to be local to each detector and , therefore , can be rejected by analysing data from a network . given a network with different orientations and locations of the detectors , gw sources can be localized on the sky and the waveforms of the two independent gw polarization components can be reconstructed .",
    "methods for the analysis of data from a network of gw detectors can be divided into two classes : _ coincidence _ and _ coherent _ methods . in coincidence methods , first , a search for gw signals is carried out for individual detectors and a list of candidate events is generated .",
    "then a subset of events is selected by requiring temporal coincidence of events between the detectors . in coherent methods , one ,",
    "first , combines the detector responses and then analyzes the combined data to generate a single list of events .",
    "networks of detectors are particularly important for searches of gravitational wave _ burst _ signals .",
    "these are defined to be broadband signals that may come either from unanticipated sources or from sources for which no reliable theoretical prediction exists for signal waveforms .",
    "potential astrophysical sources of burst signals are stellar core collapse in supernovae  @xcite , mergers of binary neutron star or black hole systems  @xcite and gamma ray burst progenitors  @xcite .",
    "the first coherent method for burst searches with a network of three misaligned detectors was proposed by grsel and tinto  @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the detector responses are combined into a functional , which attains its minimum at the correct direction to the source .",
    "the minimization of the functional allows one to reconstruct the source coordinates and two polarization waveforms of the burst signal .",
    "flannagan and hughes  @xcite considered maximization of the _ likelihood functional _",
    "@xcite as a means of reconstructing source direction and polarization waveforms .",
    "@xcite extended this approach to derive a detection statistic called _",
    "excess power_. it is obtained by integrating the likelihood functional , weighted by a bayesian prior probability density , over the space of all waveforms . in this paper , we refer to signal detection and reconstruction based on the global maximum of the unweighted likelihood functional as the _ standard likelihood _ method .",
    "another coherent method , proposed by sylvestre @xcite , starts with the _ ad hoc _ approach of forming a linear combination of data from a network of detectors .",
    "the combination coefficients are then adjusted to construct a quadratic detection algorithm that satisfies certain well defined criteria .",
    "@xcite have numerically explored the issue of statistical performance of coherent and coincidence methods and find that the former are more efficient than the latter for burst signals . in the case of signals with known waveforms ,",
    "finn  @xcite has shown using simulations that a coherent method can also be robust when confronted with non - gaussian noise .",
    "coherent methods can also be used for rejecting coincident background signals .",
    "cadonati  @xcite has proposed a cross - correlation test , called _",
    "r - statistic _ , for pairs of aligned detectors as a follow up consistency check on a coincidence analysis  @xcite .",
    "rakhmanov and klimenko  @xcite have proposed the _ mixed correlations _",
    "method that extends the cross - correlation test to a network of three or more misaligned detectors .",
    "wen and schutz  @xcite have recently generalized the coherent approach of grsel and tinto  @xcite to create a method for rejecting background coincident signals with a network of arbitrary detectors . in this paper , we propose a method for the coherent detection and reconstruction of burst signals that is based on the use of the likelihood ratio  @xcite .",
    "our analysis differs from  @xcite in an important way .",
    "we identify and solve a problem with the standard likelihood analysis , first spotted in  @xcite .",
    "the problem , which we call the _ two detector paradox _ , is that the maximum likelihood ratio statistic for misaligned detectors does not reduce , contrary to physical intuition , to the statistic for co - aligned detectors in the limit of small misalignment angles .",
    "the latter statistic depends on the cross - correlation of detector outputs whereas the former does not .",
    "we show that the problem originates in the maximization of the likelihood ratio functional over all signal waveforms including those to which a detector network may not actually be sensitive .",
    "we propose a solution to this problem that is based on constraints imposed on the gw signal waveforms .",
    "the constrained maximization of the likelihood functional yields new detection and reconstruction methods which we call the _ constraint likelihood _ methods .",
    "unlike the grsel and tinto method , the constraint likelihood methods can be used for arbitrary networks , including networks consisting of two detectors .",
    "the performance of these methods is studied in comparison with the standard likelihood method by using the numerical simulations . in the simulation",
    "we use networks of interferometric detectors consisting of ligo 4  km detector in hanford ( h1 ) , ligo 4  km detector in livingston ( l1 ) , geo-600 detector ( g1 ) , tama detector ( t1 ) and virgo detector ( v1 ) .",
    "we find that the constraints employed in this paper enhance the detection efficiency of the likelihood method . for detected sources ,",
    "the constraints significantly improve accuracy of the source localization .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s_network ] lays out much of the basic notation and conventions used in the paper . in section  [ overview ] , we provide an overview of the standard likelihood approach and its application to burst signals .",

    "the results from numerical studies of the performance of these methods are described in section  [ results ] .",
    "gravitational waves are described by a symmetric tensor of second rank @xmath0 , which is usually defined in the transverse - traceless gauge  @xcite .",
    "it takes particularly simple form in the coordinate frame associated with the wave . in this coordinate frame ( the wave frame ) , a gravitational wave propagates in the direction of @xmath1 axis and it can be described with the waveforms @xmath2 and @xmath3 representing two independent polarizations components of the wave .",
    "in addition to the waveforms @xmath2 and @xmath3 we will use complex waveforms defined as @xmath4 in what follows tilde will always denote complex conjugation . the gw waveforms @xmath5 and @xmath6 are eigenstates of the rotations around @xmath1-axis in the wave frame .",
    "we denote this particular rotation by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the rotation angle .",
    "the rotation @xmath7 generates equivalent waveforms which are different representations of the same gravitational wave .",

    "the response of the interferometer to an arbitrary gravitational wave @xmath0 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the detector tensor  @xcite .",
    "in the wave frame the detector response is a linear superposition of two gw polarizations @xmath13 where the coefficients @xmath14 and @xmath15 are known as antenna patterns .    to calculate the antenna pattern",

    "in this section , we present a brief overview of the standard likelihood approach to the detection and reconstruction of gravitational wave burst signals using a network of detectors . though the scientific content of this section is essentially the same as the results in  @xcite , our derivation and the notation we use are rather different .",
    "these will aid in a clearer exposition of our main results in subsequent sections .",
    "the reader is referred to  @xcite for a textbook level discussion of the statistical theory of signal detection used in this paper .",
    "consider an observable that is a finite data segment @xmath34,x[2],\\ldots , x[n]\\}$ ] from a noisy time series .",
    "the simplest detection problem is to define a _",
    "decision rule _ for selecting one of two mutually exclusive hypotheses , @xmath35 ( _ null hypothesis _ ) or @xmath36 ( _ alternative hypothesis _ ) , about the data @xmath37 . under the @xmath35 and @xmath36",
    ", @xmath38 is a realization of a stohastic process described by the joint probability density @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .",

    "- @xmath35 is selected when @xmath36 is true .",
    "each error will have a probability associated with it , namely , the false alarm and the false dismissal probabilities @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively . in order to select the best decision rule ,",
    "several criteria have been proposed out of which the neyman - pearson criterion is the most suitable for detection of gravitational waves . according to this criterion , the optimal decision rule has the least @xmath42 for fixed @xmath41 .",
    "the rule accepts @xmath36 ( @xmath35 ) when the _ likelihood ratio _ , @xmath43 , defined as @xmath44 is greater ( less ) than a threshold value that is fixed by the specified @xmath41 . in the case of the gw data analysis",

    "likelihood_.    the situation with two mutually exclusive hypotheses , outlined above , is the simplest one . in general , as in the case of gw analysis , the observed data @xmath38 can be a realization of one among several joint probability densities @xmath50 , @xmath51 , where , as usual , @xmath35 is the null hypotheses and @xmath52 are the alternative hypotheses . correspondingly , the probabilities for false alarm and false dismissal can be assigned but now the false dismissal probabilities @xmath53 are hypothesis specific .",
    "one possible generalization of the neyman - pearson criterion could be to select that decision rule which minimizes all probabilities @xmath53 for a fixed false alarm probability @xmath41 .",
    "it turns out that , in general , no such rule is possible  @xcite .",
    "another approach is to generalize the likelihood ratio test itself by constructing a functional @xmath54\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and comparing it with a threshold .",
    "this test , called the maximum likelihood ratio ( mlr ) test , tends to outperform any other _ ad hoc _ test .",
    "however , it is important to note that the mlr test itself does not have a formal proof of optimality . therefore , it is possible that modifications of the mlr test , as presented in this paper , can lead to better performance .",
    "one of the applications of the mlr test is the detection of gravitational waves from the inspiral of compact binaries  @xcite . in principle",
    ", the waveforms of the gw signals can be calculated to arbitrary precision given the parameters of the binary system .",
    "the set of alternative hypotheses now becomes a continuum that is identified with the space of binary parameters .",
    "the likelihood ratio @xmath55 can , therefore , be expressed as a function over the binary parameters .",
    "the mlr statistic is obtained by maximizing the likelihood ratio over these parameters and reaches its maximum for the best match of the corresponding waveform to the data .",
    "in contrast to binary inspiral signals , where the number of parameters is small , the parameters characterizing burst signals are essentially the signal amplitudes themselves at each instant of time .",
    "thus , for burst signals , the number of parameters can be very large .",
    "formally , however , the concept of the likelihood ratio can still be used for burst signals . in this case , the likelihood ratio is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the detector response to the burst signal .",
    "the application of the mlr test to burst signals involves maximization over each sample @xmath58 $ ] independently  @xcite .",
    "so far , we have considered a time series @xmath38 at the output of a single gw detector . the entire formalism outlined above",
    "can be extended to a network of detectors .",
    "let the data from the @xmath59 detector be @xmath60,x_k[2],\\ldots\\}$ ] and the detector response to the gravitational wave be @xmath61}=u[i]\\tilde{a}_k+\\tilde{u}[i]a_k.\\ ] ] we will assume that the noise in different detectors is independent . then the likelihood ratio becomes , @xmath62 \\xi_k[i ] -   \\frac{1}{2 } \\xi_k^2[i]\\right)\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 is the number of detectors in the network . for detectors illuminated by the same gw source , the detector responses are not independent .",
    "therefore , the variation of the likelihood functional is performed over the sampled amplitudes @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] . to characterize the angular and strain sensitivity of the network",
    ", we introduce the _ network antenna patterns _",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 is real and @xmath68 is complex .",
    "similarly to the antenna patterns @xmath69 for a single detector , they describe the _ network response _ to the gravitational wave : @xmath70 we also define the network output time series @xmath71 which combines the output time series @xmath72 from individual detectors @xmath73 to simplify equations , we will replace summation over any sampled time series @xmath74 $ ] with @xmath75 . with these new notations the likelihood functional can be written as @xmath76 where the @xmath77 and @xmath78 are complex conjugates of @xmath79 and @xmath68 respectively .",
    "the equations for the gw waveforms are obtained by variation of the likelihood functional : @xmath80 which results in two linear equations for @xmath28 and @xmath81 @xmath82 the solution is @xmath83 note , the solution @xmath84 satisfies the condition @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the network response to the gravitational wave ( see eq.([response ] ) ) .",
    "equations [ linear1 ] and [ linear2 ] can also be written in the matrix form @xmath87 =     m_r     \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } h_+ \\\\",
    "h_{\\times } \\\\   \\end{array } \\right ] \\;,\\ ] ] where the matrix @xmath88 is given by @xmath89.\\ ] ]      the maximum likelihood ratio statistic is obtained by substitution of the solution @xmath84 in eq.([fun1 ] ) @xmath90 where the quantities @xmath91 and @xmath92 are defined by @xmath93 and @xmath94 is complex conjugate of @xmath95 .",
    "the data matrix @xmath96 is calculated for the detector output @xmath97 and @xmath98 scaled by the variances of the detector noise @xmath99",
    "the data matrix depends on the gravitational wave time delays @xmath100 between the detectors .",
    "the time delays , in turn , depend on the coordinates of the source on the sky @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the data matrix represent the power terms and the non - diagonal elements represent the cross - correlation terms .",
    "there is a simple geometrical interpretation of the mlr statistics . at any instance of time",
    ", the gw waveform @xmath28 and the network output @xmath71 can be viewed as vectors @xmath101 and @xmath102 in the complex plane .",
    "then the mlr statistics , given by eq.([l0 ] ) , is the inner product @xmath103 which is a projection of the solution @xmath84 onto the data @xmath71 .",
    "note , that the projection is the estimator of the total signal - to - noise ratio of the gw signal detected in the network @xmath104",
    "so far we have described the standard likelihood approach for the detection and reconstruction of burst gw signals wherein the likelihood ratio is maximized independently over each signal sample . though attractive because both a detection and estimation method are obtained simultaneously , there is a problem with this approach when applied to a network of two detectors .",
    "the problem , which we call the _ two - detector paradox _",
    ", is described in this section .",
    "let us consider a network of two detectors in two configurations : ( a ) aligned detectors and ( m ) misaligned detectors .",
    "the detectors in the configuration a have the same antenna patterns . in this case",
    "the detector responses are the same in both detectors and we consider the gw signal as the scalar wave @xmath105 .",
    "the likelihood functional is then @xmath106 where @xmath107 , @xmath108 are the detector outputs and @xmath109 , @xmath110 are the standard deviations of the detector noise .",
    "the solution of the likelihood variation problem is @xmath111 the mlr statistics for two aligned detectors is obtained from eq.([lla ] ) by substituting @xmath105 with the solution @xmath112 as expected , the mlr statistic for two aligned detectors includes both the power and the cross - correlation terms . for two arbitrary misaligned detectors the mlr statistic , given by eq.([l0 ] ) , reduces to @xmath113 which includes the power terms only .",
    "the two detector paradox is that the statistic @xmath114 does not include cross - correlation between the detectors even for a small misalignment .",
    "this is highly counterintuitive since one expects that the response of detectors to the same gw source will differ only infinitesimally when the detectors are infinitesimally misaligned .",
    "hence , as in the case of @xmath115 , one would expect that the cross - correlation term will benefit detection and that its importance will decline only gradually as the detectors are misaligned .",
    "in other words , the functional @xmath114 is expected to approach @xmath115 in the limit of perfect alignment .",
    "the origin of the two detector paradox is easily seen . for the aligned case",
    ", the standard likelihood ratio approach has the prior information that both detector responses are identical .",
    "hence , the cross - correlation term is guaranteed to have positive mean and , thus , should improve the detectability of gw signals . while , for the misaligned case , it is always possible to specify two arbitrary responses and invert them to obtain some @xmath26 and @xmath116 components of the gw signal . the standard mlr statistic , therefore , does not benefit from having the cross - correlation term since now it can contribute pure noise to the statistic .",
    "hence , this term disappears from the mlr statistic .",
    "the fact that the standard likelihood approach does not exhibit the expected continuity for the case of two detectors indicates that this approach may not be the best one for a general network of gw detectors also .",
    "to resolve the two detector paradox we take a closer look at how the gw signal and the detector noise contribute to the mlr statistic . in this section",
    "we show that the detection of two gw components can be considered as two independent measurements equally affected by the detector noise but conducted with different angular and strain sensitivities of the detectors .",
    "being an _ ad hoc _ method , the maximum likelihood may not be an optimal approach in this situation .",
    "for example , if the network is sensitive only to one signal component ( as in the case of co - aligned detectors ) the measurement of the second component does not benefit the gw detection , but rather adds noise to the measurement . in the next section we propose a solution to the problem and derive the detection statistics , which continuously bridge the cases of aligned and misaligned detectors .      as we mentioned in section  [ dresponse ] ,",
    "the detector response is invariant under rotations @xmath10 in the wave frame .",
    "consequently , all measurable quantities , including the likelihood functional , are invariant as well .",
    "we have a freedom to select an arbitrary wave frame by applying the rotation @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the rotation angle .",
    "the rotation induces the transformation of the gw waveforms and the detector antenna patterns ( see eq.([au ] ) ) , as well as the transformation of the network parameters : @xmath117 and @xmath118 . in general",
    ", the rotation angle @xmath8 can be selected individually for each instance of time and for each point in the sky . by applying the rotation @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the phase of @xmath68 , we selected a wave frame in which both network antenna patterns are real and positively defined .",
    "we call this particular coordinate frame the dominant polarization frame .    as follows from eq.([response ] ) , for a gw signal @xmath28 defined in the dominant polarization frame , the network response is @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the real and imaginary components of the signal",
    ". we will distinguish them from the gw polarizations @xmath124 and @xmath125 defined for an arbitrary wave frame .",
    "note , the coefficients in front of @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the eigenvalues of the network response matrix @xmath88 ( eq.([rmatrix ] ) ) , which takes a diagonal form in the dominant polarization frame @xmath126 the coefficient @xmath127 characterizes the network sensitivity to the @xmath128 wave .",
    "the sensitivity to the second component @xmath129 is @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the network alignment factor : @xmath132 the alignment factor @xmath131 shows the relative sensitivity of the network to the gw components @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "note that @xmath133 .",
    "the total signal - to - noise ratio of the gw signal detected in the network is @xmath134 where @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the sum - square energies carried by each component ( see eq.([ess ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , to be detected with the same signal - to - noise ratio , the @xmath123 wave should carry @xmath137 times more energy than the @xmath122 wave .    both the network sensitivity and the alignment factor depend on the angular and the strain sensitivities of the detectors .",
    "the alignment factor reflects also the angular alignment of the detectors . for co - aligned detectors @xmath138 and the @xmath129 component of the gw signal can not be detected . even for detectors with large angular misalignment , depending on the sky",
    "coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath22 , the alignment factor may take small values indicating that the detectors are effectively aligned .",
    "for example , figure  [ factorfig ] shows the alignment factors as a function of the sky coordinates calculated for several network configurations consisting of the h1 , l1 , g1 , v1 and t1 detectors . for simplicity , we assume that the detectors have the same strain sensitivity",
    ". the example shows , that for the closely aligned h1-l1 detectors , the alignment factor is close to zero everywhere , except for a few small patches on the sky .",
    "the more detectors are added to the network , the larger is the area on the sky with large values of @xmath131 .",
    "but even for the network of five detectors ( h1-l1-g1-v1-t1 ) , the factor @xmath131 remains small for a considerable fraction of the sky area , where the network is much less sensitive to the @xmath129 wave , than to the @xmath128 wave .",
    "assuming that both components carry on average the same energy , the @xmath129 wave is suppressed by the factor of @xmath131 .",
    "therefore , the @xmath129 component adds little to the total signal - to - noise ratio @xmath139 for gw signals originating from areas on the sky with small values of @xmath131 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath140 defines the overall sensitivity of the network to the gravitational waves .",
    "figure  [ sensitivity ] shows the network sensitivity calculated as a function of the sky coordinates for several network configurations . as we expect , adding more detectors reduces the sky area where the network is blind to gravitational waves .          in the dominant polarization frame",
    "the likelihood functional can be written as @xmath141 where @xmath142 .",
    "expressed in terms of @xmath128 and @xmath129 , it can be written as @xmath143 : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the amplitude and @xmath146 is the phase of the data vector @xmath147 .",
    "the solutions for the @xmath128 and @xmath129 are obtained by the variation of the @xmath148 and @xmath149 functionals : @xmath150 the mlr statistic can be calculated separately for each component @xmath151 the statistics @xmath152 and @xmath153 are the estimators of the signal - to - noise ratio of two gw components detected in the network .",
    "the detector output @xmath154 is a sum of the detector noise @xmath155 and the detector response @xmath156 . if no gw signal is present than the network output is @xmath157 which follows from the definition of the data vector @xmath71 ( see eq.([datav ] ) ) . in this case , as follows from eq.([uuu ] ) , the likelihood variation procedure produces the non - zero solutions @xmath84 for the gw waveforms and the mlr statistic is the biased estimator of @xmath158 .",
    "the reconstructed sum - square energy @xmath159 is biased as well , where @xmath160 and @xmath160 are the mlr statistics due to the detector noise .",
    "the ensemble average @xmath161 can be easily calculated when the detector noise is white and gaussian .",
    "indeed , in this case the mean of the data matrix is @xmath162 where @xmath163 is the kronecker delta .",
    "the average mlr statistics due to the detector noise is than @xmath164 as one can see , in average the detector noise introduces the same bias for each signal component . from eq.([eqf2 ] ) it follows that the reconstructed energy in the second component is proportional to @xmath137 and it diverges when @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , for small values of @xmath131 , the likelihood variation procedure may result in the un - physical solutions for the signal component @xmath129 .",
    "this is the root of the two detector paradox described in section  [ 2dp ] .    the statistics @xmath152 and @xmath153 can be considered as two independent measurements of the gw components @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "indeed , the measurements are uncorrelated , and their fluctuations are characterized by the same variances of the noise , which follows from the equations @xmath166 when the value of the alignment factor is small , the standard mlr statistic @xmath167 is not the optimal estimator of @xmath158 , because the second component adds pure noise into the measurement .",
    "we have seen that for the standard likelihood approach the problem arises when there is a large asymmetry ( @xmath168 ) in the detection of two gw components . in this case",
    "we could find better estimators for the gw waveforms and for the total signal - to - noise ratio of the gw signal detected in the network .",
    "the construction of such estimators depend on our assumptions about the gw signals .",
    "mathematically these assumptions can be implemented as constraints applied to the likelihood functional .",
    "the purpose of the constraints is to exclude the un - physical solutions arising from the variation of the likelihood functional . by removing such solutions from the waveform parameter space",
    "we expect to sacrifice a small fraction of the real gw signals , while considerably improve the detection for the rest of the sources .",
    "below we consider examples of the likelihood constraints that can be used in the analysis .      given a source population , we could expect that in average both signal components @xmath128 and @xmath129 carry about the same energy .",
    "for example , for binary sources , the gravitational waves are emitted with the random inclination angles . for waves in the dominant polarization frame , which is oriented randomly with",
    "respect to the source frame , the ensemble mean of the sum - square energies of two components satisfies @xmath169    for areas in the sky where the network alignment factor is small , for most of the sources the detected energy will be dominated by the first component ( see eq.([q2 ] ) ) .",
    "for example , for a network consisting of three interferometric detectors h1 , l1 and g1 the alignment factor is less then 0.1 for approximately 50% of the sky area .",
    "therefore , the noisy component @xmath129 can be entirely ignored for those sky locations where @xmath131 is less then some threshold @xmath170 .",
    "this requirement impose a constraint on the reconstructed gw waveforms and , therefore , on the mlr statistic . for a given sky location",
    "we define the _ hard _ mlr statistic as @xmath171 when the threshold @xmath172 , the mlr statistics is defined by the first signal component only . in the limit of a small alignment angle between the detectors ( @xmath165 ) ,",
    "the hard constraint statistics converges to the statistics for co - aligned detectors thus resolving the two detector paradox .",
    "the hard constraint is a good approximation in the case of closely aligned detectors , such as the network of the h1-l1 detectors .",
    "the simulation results ( see section  [ results ] ) show , that the @xmath152 is a reasonably good statistic even for a network of the h1-l1-g1 detectors with large angular misalignment between the ligo and geo detectors .",
    "however , if the detection statistic @xmath152 is used , the search algorithm is entirely inefficient to a gw signal when @xmath173 .",
    "although , such gw signals are quite unlikely ( due to random relative orientations of the source and the dominant polarization frames ) , and for small values of @xmath131 they may not be detected anyway ( unless the @xmath129 component is very strong ) , in the next section we introduce a different constraint , which is free from this problem .",
    "as we mentioned in section  [ factorization ] , the unconstrained mlr statistic @xmath167 is a sum of the statistics @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which can be written as @xmath174 if the detector output is dominated by the gw signal , and assuming that both gw components carry about the same energy , the ensemble average for @xmath175 is @xmath176 which follows from the expression for the network response ( see eq.([q1 ] ) ) .",
    "it means that in average @xmath177 and the second term in eq.([soft1 ] ) is much less then @xmath178 . on contrary , for the detector noise @xmath179 and respectively @xmath180 therefore , the noisy second term in eq.([soft1 ] ) can be omitted , resulting in the statistic , which we call the _ soft _ mlr statistic @xmath181    there is a simple statistical justification of this result .",
    "since the statistics @xmath152 and @xmath153 are two uncorrelated gaussian random variables with the mean @xmath182 and @xmath183 , and the variance @xmath184 , the joint probability @xmath185 belongs to the rayleigh distribution . for the assumption above ( see eq.([assh ] ) ) , we expect that @xmath186 and @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is the gw sum - square energy .",
    "then the best estimator for @xmath158 is obtained by maximizing @xmath189 over @xmath188 , which gives the statistic @xmath190 .    to obtain the solution for the gw waveforms",
    ", one should impose a constraint on the likelihood functional itself .",
    "the constraint can be integrated into the variation procedure by the method of the lagrange multiplier @xcite . in this method , first , we have to obtain the constraint equation .",
    "the soft constraint can be constructed by requiring that @xmath191 which limits the sum - square energies @xmath192 and @xmath193 . since",
    ", the constraint is applied to the @xmath129 component only , we can replace the @xmath128 with the solution for the first component and re - write the constraint as @xmath194 the solution for the second gw component @xmath195 is trivially obtained by the constraint variation of the likelihood functional @xmath196 @xmath197 as one can see , the constrained solution is the standard solution @xmath129 , multiplied by a penalty factor of @xmath198 , which reduces both the noise and the signal contribution from the second component to the mlr statistic at small values of @xmath199 .",
    "obviously , it reduces the sensitivity of the @xmath200 statistic to a particular class of gw signals with @xmath173 , described in section  [ hard ] . for these signals , to be detected with the same false alarm rate , the @xmath190 statistic requires @xmath201 times more powerful gw signal , then the standard @xmath167 statistic . for example , for @xmath202 the degradation of the strain sensitivity is by a factor of 2 .",
    "but it happens only for a small fraction of the gw sources .",
    "compare to the standard likelihood method , for most of the sources we expect to improve the detection sensitivity if the @xmath190 statistic is used .",
    "( top ) , @xmath203 ( middle ) and @xmath190 ( bottom ) for the detector network h1-l1-g1 .",
    "the injected signal snr is @xmath204 ( h1 ) , @xmath205 ( l1 ) and @xmath206 ( g1 ) .",
    "the source is located at @xmath207 and @xmath208.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      in un - triggered burst searches the coordinates of the source , @xmath23 and @xmath22 are free parameters . in this case , the detector responses , the likelihood statistics and the reconstructed waveforms become functions of @xmath23 and @xmath22 or skymaps .",
    "for example , the skymaps corresponding to different statistics are shown in figure  [ 3detskymaps ] .",
    "( for details see section  [ results ] ) .    for a given location in the sky ,",
    "the value of the likelihood statistic indicates how consistent the data is with the hypothesis that a gw signal originates from that location .",
    "the coordinates @xmath23 and @xmath22 which yield maximum for the likelihood statistic correspond to the most probable location of the source .",
    "the maximum value of the statistic is then used for detection . by setting a threshold on the maximum likelihood value",
    "one can decide on the presence or absence of a gravitational wave signal in the data as described in section  [ overview ] .",
    "given the most probable source coordinates the waveforms @xmath26 and @xmath3 are reconstructed as described in section  [ constraint ] .",
    "we have outlined a general method for using the mlr statistic in conjunction with constraints limiting the space of the gw waveforms . the method is intended for application to burst searches with networks of gravitational wave detectors .",
    "the performance of the method and the effect of the constraints can be analyzed using numerical simulations with modeled waveforms .",
    "the present simulation is similar to the one previously used for estimating the performance of the mixed correlation method @xcite .",
    "the two - polarization waveforms which represent burst gravitational waves used in the simulation are taken from the numerical models of the merger phase of coalescing binary black holes ( bh )  @xcite .",
    "these waveforms form a one - parameter family bh-@xmath209 , where @xmath209 is the total mass of the binary system in units of solar mass .",
    "the results below correspond to @xmath210 . in the simulations we generate the detector noise which is gaussian and white .",
    "the variance of the noise is selected to be the same for all detectors .",
    "a typical simulated data segment has the duration of 1 second and consists of @xmath211 data samples . for calculation of the data matrix ( see eq.([dmatrix ] ) ) we set the integration window of 85  ms , which is substantially greater than the duration of the signal .",
    "the magnitude of the simulated signals is controlled by the overall gain @xmath212 , which is varied from @xmath213 to @xmath214 , whereas the magnitude of the noise is kept fixed .",
    "due to different orientation of the detectors with respect to the incoming gravitational wave , the detectors responses are different ( see eq.([detresp ] ) ) . to characterize the magnitude of the signal in",
    "any given detector we define the signal - to - noise ratio : @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the power spectral density of the noise .",
    "for white gaussian noise @xmath217 , where @xmath218 is the sampling rate .    for any given detector in the network ,",
    "the magnitude of the signal varies significantly depending on the source location in the sky .",
    "we therefore choose the location of the simulated sources at random , with a uniform distribution over the sky .",
    "we also choose the polarization angle @xmath8 at random from the interval @xmath219 $ ] .",
    "with these choices the simulation gives us an estimate of the performance of the detection algorithms without the bias which can be introduced by the particular choice for the source location or its polarization angle .",
    "the simulation consists of series of tests corresponding to different values of snr ( controlled by @xmath212 ) . for each value of @xmath212",
    "a total number of 10,000 injections were made . to characterize the strength of the signal in each detector for the entire test we introduce the sky - average snr , denoted by @xmath220 .",
    "the sky - average snr is proportional to @xmath212 and it is the same for each detector in the network ( @xmath221 ) .      in the simulation we tested the following detection methods : the standard likelihood method ( @xmath222 ) , the hard constraint method ( @xmath223 ) , and the soft constraint nethod ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "the detection performance of the methods is compared by using the receiver operating characteristic ( roc ) , which shows the detection probability as a function of the false alarm probability .",
    "examples of the roc curves , corresponding to @xmath225 and @xmath226 , are shown in figure  [ rocdets3 ] .",
    "the accuracy of the source localization depends on the strength of the gw signal and on the network configuration . with only one detector in the network ,",
    "the likelihood statistics is constant across the sky ( it has no @xmath23 or @xmath22 dependence ) and therefore the source localization is not possible .",
    "however , already with two spatially separated detectors the network becomes sensitive to the source location ( see figure  [ 2detskymaps ] ) . in the case of two closely aligned detectors h1-l1 ,",
    "the area with the large values of the likelihood is rather a ring then a point , showing an ambiguity in the determination of the source location .",
    "but even in this case the method gives directional information about the source and allows exclusion of the most of the sky area as inconsistent with the detected gw signal .",
    "for two misaligned detectors h1-g1 , the source localization is more accurate due to different angular sensitivities of the detectors .",
    "even more accurate estimation of the source coordinates can be obtained with three and more detectors in the network ( see figure  [ 3detskymaps ] )",
    ". the greater the number of the detectors in the network , the better the source localization .     and @xmath208.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "the error in the source localization is given by the angle @xmath227 between the true direction to the source and the reconstructed direction to the source .",
    "equivalently , @xmath227 can be defined as the length of an arc connecting these two locations on a sphere with unit radius . to describe the efficiency of the source localization we introduce the following figure of merit .",
    "first , we chose a cone with the opening angle @xmath228 which constitutes an acceptable error .",
    "then we calculate the number of detected sources ( @xmath229 ) which satisfy the condition @xmath230 .",
    "the ratio of @xmath229 to the total number of injections defines the efficiency of the source localization and depends on the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath231 .",
    "figure  [ angerr ] shows the efficiencies of the source localization for the l1-h1-g1 network corresponding to the different detection methods . in this example , the values of the acceptable localization error are chosen to be @xmath232 and @xmath233 .",
    "note that the constraint likelihood methods perform considerably better than the standard likelihood method .",
    "let us consider , for example , the source localization for @xmath220 of 10 ( 20 ) .",
    "the hard constraint method recovers approximately @xmath234 ( @xmath235 ) of all simulated sources within the @xmath236-degree angle from their true location . in comparison ,",
    "the standard likelihood method yields only @xmath237 ( @xmath238 ) efficiency for the same angle . within the @xmath239-degree angle ,",
    "the hard constraint method recovers @xmath235 ( @xmath240 ) of all the simulated sources , whereas the standard method yields only @xmath241 ( @xmath242 ) efficiency .",
    "similar comparisons hold for the soft constraint method .",
    "we find that for both constraint likelihood methods , the events with poorly reconstructed coordinates come from the areas in the sky with small values of the network sensitivity .",
    "we have presented a novel approach to the detection and reconstruction of gravitational waves with an arbitrary network of interferometric detectors . starting with the network likelihood ratio functional for unknown gravitational wave burst signals , we identify and solve the two detector paradox .",
    "the essence of the paradox is that in the case of two arbitrary misaligned detectors the maximum likelihood ratio statistics depends only on the power in the detector data streams .",
    "it does not agree with the statistic of two co - aligned detectors , which depends also on the cross - correlation between the detectors .",
    "we show that the problem is associated with the different sensitivity of the detector network to two polarization components of the gw signal and present not only in the case of two detectors , but for any arbitrary network .",
    "to characterize the difference in the sensitivity to the gw components , we introduce the network alignment factor . for locations on the sky where the value of the alignment factor is small ,",
    "the network is sensitive to only one gw component and the variation of the likelihood functional results in the un - physical solutions for the second gw component . to exclude the un - physical solutions we propose to use constraints , which limit the parameter space of the gw waveforms and result in a new class of the maximum likelihood ratio statistics . for the networks of two and more detectors , the constraint likelihood methods allow reconstruction of the two gw polarization components and the location of the source on the sky .    in the paper",
    "we introduce two examples of the constraint statistics , which performance is compared with the standard likelihood statistics .",
    "the performance of the method was estimated with the numerical simulation .",
    "we restricted our simulation to the case of the white gaussian noise .",
    "for simplisity we assumed that all detectors have identical sensitivities though the method presented in this paper does not have these restrictions .",
    "our simulation results indicate that the constraint likelihood method enhance the detection of the gw signals and performs significantly better than the standard likelihood method in the reconstruction of the source coordinates .",
    "we believe that since all the methods we have considered are compared on exactly the same footing , our results regarding relative performance will not change for the general case . however , as a work in progress , we plan to expand our simulations to more realistic detector noise .",
