    "all elementary charged fermions in the standard model ( sm ) are dirac fermions . nevertheless , the nature of the neutrino is not yet definitely settled and depending on the model the neutrino can be either a majorana or dirac fermion . by discriminating the electromagnetic behavior of the neutrino",
    ", we could have an alternative resource ( aside the neutrinoless double beta decay ) to determine the nature of such a particle .",
    "since neutrinos do not carry electric charge , they can participate in electromagnetic interactions by coupling with photons only via quantum corrections . likewise , as it happens for other particles , electromagnetic properties of neutrinos can be described employing electromagnetic form factors ( effs ) .",
    "for example , by the realization of their multipole moments , neutrinos can be sensitive to intense electromagnetic fields .",
    "such intense fields can exist in nature indeed ; it has been suggested that there could be sources of magnetic fields of order @xmath1 g , as it could be the case during a supernova explosion or in the vicinity of particular groups of neutron stars known as magnetars @xcite .",
    "several experiments have measured phenomenological constraints over neutrinos effs , particularly their magnetic dipole moment ( mdm ) , which in the most stringent bound the respective value should be less to @xmath2 @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the first prototypical model to take into account these experimental thresholds has been the sm with right - handed neutrinos ( transforming as singlets of sm gauge group ) .",
    "however , and from effective operators computations , mdms in this minimal extended sm give contributions with considerable several orders of magnitude below of this experimental threshold ; under the small values of neutrino masses @xcite",
    ". a way to enhance these contributions can be introduced by new physics effects @xcite , such as those described by a well motivated extended higgs sector .",
    "present limits on the scalar sector in the sm still allow the possibility of an extended higgs sector , if the correspondent effects are weak enough in the current decay channels for the detection of the sm like scalar in the mass region around of @xmath4 gev @xcite .",
    "we shall study one of the simplest extensions of the scalar sector of the sm , the so - called two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) in which we add to the symmetry breaking sector of electroweak gauge group two higgs doublets with the same quantum numbers of isospin and hypercharge .",
    "there are many motivations for this model .",
    "one of them is the fact that the sm with just one higgs doublet is unable to generate a baryon asymmetry of the universe of sufficient size as well as plausible dark matter candidates , or to explain the mass hierarchy in the third generation of quarks .",
    "two higgs doublet models are possible scenarios to solve these problems , due to the flexibility of their scalar mass spectrum and the existence of additional sources of @xmath5 violation diaz . also , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", a second doublet should be added to cancel chiral anomalies @xcite ; since scalars are represented by chiral multiplets together with spin @xmath6 fields . moreover , in mssm , a minimal higgs sector is unable to give the mass to the up type quarks and down type quarks simultaneously , because doublets of different chiralities can not be coupled together in the lagrangian .",
    "thus , a second higgs doublet must be introduced to endow all quarks with masses .",
    "furthermore , the origin of neutrino masses is still an open question in high energy physics . explaining the smallness of neutrino masses in the sm demands to consider an effective operator involving a possible high energy scale for new physics related to perhaps a most fundamental theory . indeed",
    ", 2hdms could be invoked to describe the neutrino - hierarchy problem by the introduction of a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for one of the doublets in the scale of neutrino masses .",
    "this approach can be achieved by the realization of 2hdm - neutrino specific , where fundamentals of the model are incorporated when the new doublet couples only to the neutrino sector gabriel , logan1,logan2 .",
    "when 2hdm is built up , the general form of yukawa couplings among fermions and scalars compatible with gauge invariance have rare processes called flavor changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) .",
    "experiments such as @xmath7 mixing highly constrain flavor violation currents @xcite .",
    "the discrete symmetry @xmath8 ( e.g. @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) as an intrinsic parity is usually implemented in the 2hdm because it forbids mixing between the two doublets , which is the primary source of fcncs .",
    "moreover , this symmetry ensures a cp - conserving frame in the scalar sector when @xmath8 symmetry extended to the higgs potential . in the last point",
    ", the @xmath8 transformation unfolds the 2hdm since its presence ( absence ) leads to different forms of the yukawa couplings between fermions and higgs bosons with ( without ) flavor natural conservation .",
    "besides to this discrete symmetry , a continuous global symmetry like @xmath11 could be incorporated to achieve this fcnc suppression .",
    "these symmetry implementations respect the so - called weinberg - glashow theorem : all fermions should be coupled at most to one doublet to avoid fcncs naturally . in our description of neutrino mdms , we consider three models with suppression of fcncs at tree level ( type i , ii , flipped , lepton and neutrino - specific 2hdms ) and one model with that kind of couplings , i.e. , the type iii-2hdm .",
    "as it was pointed out above , couplings of neutrinos with photons occur via loop diagrams . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the loop corrections have the form of vertex diagrams and vacuum polarization diagrams .",
    "when the ssb sector includes a second doublet , further corrections appear by replacing the vector bosons @xmath12 by charged higgs bosons @xmath13 .",
    "our goal is to characterize the corrections to the eff s coming from the new physics and particularly in the region of parameters in which such factors become near to the threshold of experimental detection .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "we discuss the general form of the eff s for neutrinos in section [ form factors ] .",
    "subsequently , in section [ 2hdm ] we review the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) and its possible realizations to incorporate the neutrino masses . in section",
    "nspecific we include the neutrino - specific model with viable mass terms for neutrinos .",
    "we dedicate section [ loops ] to study the behavior of the form factors for these different 2hdms . in section [ results ]",
    "we perform the correlations between the masses and the possibility of finding observable effects coming from eff s of the neutrino in the different frameworks of 2hdms with natural flavor conservation and under the presence of fcncs .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] highlights our conclusions and remarks , as well as perspectives to implement these constraints in other models with new physics beyond sm .",
    "in this section , we review the general structure of the electromagnetic interactions of dirac and majorana neutrinos in the one - photon approximation . to find all the eff s , we use the general expression for the electromagnetic current    @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the four - momenta shown in fig .",
    "[ vertex ] , and  @xmath17 , @xmath18 are the initial and final fermion states respectively .",
    "further , @xmath19 are matrices of couplings acting on the spinors . the matrices @xmath19 have some interesting properties nova , broggini , studenikin    * the first condition is that the arrangement @xmath19 must be a cuadrivector , i.e. must be lorentz covariant . *",
    "the second condition is hermiticity of the associated current , i.e. , @xmath20 which implies@xmath21 * the current conservation or gauge invariance @xmath22 gives@xmath23    finally , the most general expression for @xmath24 reads@xmath25 \\sigma _ { \\mu \\nu } q^{\\nu } + f_{a}\\left ( q^{2}\\right ) \\left ( q^{2}\\gamma _ { \\mu}-q_{\\mu } \\neg{q}\\right ) \\gamma _ { 5 } ,   \\label{fullvertex}\\]]where @xmath26 and @xmath27 represent the electric charge , magnetic dipole moment , electric dipole moment and anapole moment respectively .",
    "the eff s show us how the particles couple with the photon at the tree level or in loop corrections . at the tree level",
    ", we got the electric charge and one part of the contribution coming from the magnetic dipole moment .",
    "now , if we consider the interaction with an external field @xmath28 in the form @xmath29the so - called anomalous magnetic moment arises .",
    "even uncharged particles may have a magnetic dipolar moment . however , for uncharged particles , all dipole moments only appear in loop corrections . just like the anomalous magnetic moment , the electric dipole moment and the anapole moment can be non - zero even for an uncharged particle @xcite .    in a similar way to what happens to other particles",
    ", neutrinos can be described by eff s with vertex functions . for neutrinos",
    ", the magnetic and electric dipole moments are expected to be slight since they are likely proportional to the neutrino masses .",
    "for instance , the leading contribution to anomalous magnetic moment is @xcite@xmath30consequently , the neutrino magnetic moment is@xmath31this relation was derived for the first time in @xcite , where @xmath32 is the bohr s magneton .",
    "other systematics , as the background field method and computations based on neutrino self - energy , have determined values in the same structure and the same order of magnitude for mdm of neutrino @xcite . if neutrino couples to photons via such moments , the neutrino electromagnetic properties can be used to distinguish majorana and dirac neutrinos . for dirac neutrinos ,",
    "the most important moment is @xmath33 because the other terms vanish in a @xmath34conserving scenario with a hermitian @xmath35 , and are highly suppressed owing to the soft violation of @xmath5 . on the other hand , for majorana neutrinos only @xmath27 is possible because the other terms vanish due to the self - conjugate nature of majorana neutrinos .",
    "table [ tab : emnc ] summarizes the contribution for the mdm of massive neutrinos ( with effective flavor masses ) .",
    "@xmath36    constraints over neutrino mdms are a result of scattering experiments ( based on mainly on the distortion of the recoil of charged leptons energy spectrum ) @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the flavor neutrino produced at some distance from the detector is a superposition of neutrino mass eigenstates .",
    "therefore , the mdm measured is an effective value which takes into account neutrino mixing and the oscillations during the propagation between source and detector @xcite .",
    "all computations shall be referred to an effective magnetic moment of a flavor neutrino without indication of a source - detector distance @xmath37 .",
    "indeed , it is implicitly understood that this value is small , such that the effective magnetic moment is independent of the neutrino energy and from the source detector distance @xcite . in such case , the effective mdm is @xmath38 ; being @xmath39 and @xmath40 the neutrino magnetic dipole moment and electric dipole moment respectively .    in a cp - conserving case ,",
    "majorana neutrinos have only transition elements ( @xmath41 are antisymmetric implying majorana neutrinos do not have diagonal elements ) .",
    "nonetheless , flavor neutrinos can have effective magnetic moments even if neutrinos are of majorana nature . in this case , since massive majorana neutrinos do not have diagonal magnetic and electric dipole moments , the effective magnetic moments of flavor neutrinos receive contributions only from the transition dipole moments .",
    "henceforth , we shall only be focused in dirac neutrinos because considered models in the next section introduce right - handed neutrinos in such a way lepton number is conserved .",
    "these scenarios based on different yukawa sectors of 2hdms lead us to elucidate as effective mdms for flavor dirac neutrinos arise regarding new physics parameters .",
    "before introducing new physics effects in mdms , we review several 2hdms differentiating flavor properties ; which are relevant in the form of interpreting electromagnetic properties for neutrinos . from a general point of view , in 2hdms , the symmetry breaking @xmath42 is implemented by introducing a new scalar doublet with the same quantum numbers of the first one . by counting the new degrees of freedom , 2hdms contain five higgs bosons in its spectrum @xcite . in a cp - conserving scenario ,",
    "the higgs sector consists of two higgs cp - even scalars @xmath43 one cp - odd scalar @xmath44 and two charged higgs bosons @xmath45 .",
    "a key parameter of the model is the ratio between the vacuum expectation values , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the vev s of the higgs doublets ; with values of @xmath49 .",
    "there are several ways to incorporate neutrino masses within the sm or its extensions , to explain the observed neutrino oscillations .",
    "we shall use a simple form which consists of adding @xmath50 right - handed singlets of neutrinos fields @xmath51 corresponding to each charged lepton , enforcing the conservation of lepton number on the lagrangian .",
    "the most general gauge invariant lagrangian that couples the higgs fields to leptons reads    @xmath52    where @xmath53represents the higgs doublets , and@xmath54 , the superscript @xmath55  indicates that the fields are not mass eigenstates yet,@xmath56 and @xmath57are non diagonal @xmath58 matrices with @xmath59 denoting family indices .",
    "@xmath60 denotes the three charged leptons and@xmath61 denotes the lepton weak isospin left - handed doublets . in ( [ yukawalagrangiani ] )",
    "we have introduced non natural masses for dirac neutrinos by considering singlets of right handed neutrinos @xmath62 .    as was pointed before , it is customary to implement a discrete symmetry in the 2hdm to suppress some processes such as the flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) . in particular by demanding the @xmath8 symmetry @xmath63fcncs are eliminated at the tree - level . here",
    "@xmath62 and @xmath64 denote right - handed singlets of the down and up types of leptons respectively .      by taking @xmath65 ,",
    "the lagrangian ( yukawalagrangiani ) is reduced to the so - called type i-2hdm . in this scenario , only @xmath66 couples in the yukawa sector and gives masses to all fermions .",
    "the lepton part of the yukawa lagrangian in this case becomes    @xmath67    and the contribution to the lepton sector coupling with @xmath68 yields@xmath69where @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , in a convenient chiral basis , vertices with @xmath68 have the following behavior @xmath71    working uniquely with the leptonic part , with the same couplings in the charged sector for type i-2hdm , is possible to describe another model without fcncs , the so - called flipped model . in the last scenario , leptons and up type quarks are coupled to @xmath72 , and @xmath73 is just coupled to down type quarks ; making type i- and",

    "@xmath75 couples and gives masses to the charged lepton sector , while @xmath66 couples and gives masses to the neutrino sector .",
    "consequently , the lepton yukawa lagrangian becomes@xmath76and the term of charged current of the lagrangian with leptons gives@xmath77 l~h^{+}+h.c.\\]]therefore , in an appropriate chiral basis , vertices for @xmath68 behave as @xmath78 l~h^{+}.\\ ] ]    for the type ii model , an interesting aspect is that the limits of the parameter space ( @xmath79 ) are very similar to those obtained by considering the minimal supersymmetric scenario .",
    "furthermore , since we are concerned only in lepton sectors , couplings with @xmath80 can also be extrapolated to the lepton specific-2hdm , where @xmath72 couples to all quarks , while that @xmath73 couples to right - handed leptons @xcite .",

    "it is achieved by imposing a convenient texture for nondiagonal matrices @xcite , i.e. proposing that fcnc couplings should be of the order of the geometric mean of the masses    @xmath97    where @xmath98 are of @xmath99 .",

    "interactions among charged leptons @xmath102 and neutrinos @xmath103 arise from the following lagrangian@xmath104    under any assumption in the couplings in the type iii-2hdm , the radical difference with other 2hdms presenting fcnc suppression is that the magnetic dipole moment arises as a consequence of flavor neutral currents , but not directly from mass terms in the lagrangian .",
    "we have considered in this paper an extension of the standard model consisting of adding one extra higgs doublet with the same quantum numbers as those for sm - doublet along with three right - handed neutrinos , which are singlets under the standard model @xmath105 @xmath11 gauge group .",
    "the vev s for both doublets belong in the same scale of energy .",
    "neutrinos couple to doublets at the same energy scale that charged leptons yielding a hierarchical problem for fermions masses .",
    "thus , in those scenarios and to take into account dirac masses and explain mdms , right - handed neutrinos are implemented in an unnatural way .",
    "we shall work on the so - called neutrino specific-2hdm , where the tiny neutrino masses could arise using a small vev , which implies fewer assumptions than fitting small masses or yukawa couplings directly . in this framework",

    "one interesting and straightforward model arising from this lagrangian structure is the neutrino specific 2hdm , wherein dirac neutrino masses are generated with the same ssb to the remaining fermions .",
    "naturalness and smallness are circumvented by the fact that a doublet acquires one vev in the same scale as the neutrino masses @xcite . to see this formally ,",
    "we introduce a higgs potential taking into account a softly broken @xmath106 symmetry using a @xmath112  term , which has small radiative corrections as well as soft contributions to rge s",
    "@xcite    @xmath113    we can settle @xmath112 as real and positive without loss of generality , by re - phasing @xmath66 and translating the excess phase into the yukawa couplings , which is already , in general , a complex matrix taking into account possible cp violation phases .",
    "note that even after the global @xmath11 is softly broken , lepton number survives as an accidental symmetry of the model .",
    "neutrinoless double beta decay and majorana neutrinos are thus absent .",
    "on the other hand , it is worthwhile to discuss naturalness dependency in the scalar spectrum and radiative corrections for propagators .",
    "likewise sm , the mass - squared parameters @xmath114 and @xmath115 in the higgs potential ( [ higgspotential1 ] ) suffer from large radiative corrections with quadratic @xmath116 sensitivity to the high - scale cutoff of the theory , in the same way as the sm higgs mass - squared parameter works .",
    "hence , hierarchy problem is still present in this model .",
    "nonetheless , it is possible to avoid it , by introducing this scalar sector in a model with strong dynamics ( e.g. composite higgs model ) or susy in tev scale .",
    "due to smallness size demanded for @xmath112 softly broken model @xmath112 has the following rge@xmath117hence its size is technically natural since radiative corrections to @xmath118 are proportional to @xmath118 itself and are only logarithmically sensitive to the cutoff . ] , this problem can be circumvented even a tev scale when mass scalar eigenstates @xmath119 and @xmath120 take appropriate values in the mass range of @xmath121 gev @xcite .",

    "the first part in ( [ nelagrangian ] ) comes from right - handed neutrinos , while the second part is sm like .",
    "this can be considered as a dirac addition for sm , where the small mass for neutrinos come from a small vev in the second doublet .",
    "these right handed neutrinos @xmath133 will pair up with the three left - handed neutrinos of the sm to form dirac particles .",

    "indeed , these limits are established to avoid divergences in the renormalization group equations .",
    "the reason is that the value of yukawa coupling ( square ) can not exceed the bound of @xmath237 since beyond this limit the chance to find out some landau pole in energy couplings evolution is significantly greater @xcite .",

    ", the constraints also exclude several values of charged higgs masses .",
    "from the latter points , we can see as the neutrino specific scenario is converted into a promising scenario to explain the mdms and its intimate relation with neutrino mass .",
    "the neutrino magnetic moment provides a tool for exploration of possible physics beyond the standard model .",
    "although the value of the magnetic moment is suppressed by the smallness of the neutrinos masses , the contribution from new physics parameters ( such as masses and mixing angles ) could become relatively significant .",
    "in particular , for the 2hdms , we evaluated the contributions coming from the insertion of the charged higgs bosons into the loops .",
    "our results show that for the type i and type ii 2hdms ( scenarios without fcnc s ) , the total contribution is located from the threshold of experimental detection in the case of electron neutrinos , obtaining a maximum contribution about three orders of magnitude below of the sm values ( type ii-2hdm ) . in the scenario of muon neutrinos ,",
    "the total contribution produces comparable values with the sm contributions for the parameters of the model type i , with the higher contributions coming from the case of model type ii . finally , such values are much higher for tau neutrinos , but those contributions are much stronger for the model type ii with @xmath242 and @xmath169 gev .",
    "the last scenario for @xmath243mdm is only two order of magnitude below of the threshold experimental given by borexino experiment .    despite",
    "the type - iii 2hdm shows a new scenario to interpret mdm as a result of fcncs , its contributions are tiny , even compared with the experimental threshold values .",
    "this effect is due to the suppression yielded by the cheng - sher anzats which defined that fcncs couplings satisfy the same hierarchical structure for leptonic mass matrices .",
    "this fact makes that fcncs for neutrinos and charged leptons become suppressed by the same ew - scale .",
    "although the models without fcncs converts into plausible scenarios for electromagnetic form factors , such frameworks are based on unnatural terms for neutrino masses . to circumvent this issue , we consider a simple 2hdm that incorporates viable masses for neutrinos .",
    "it is done by choosing a vev in the ev scale ( or even less ) for the second doublet ( @xmath48 ) , which is coupled only to dirac neutrinos . from this assumption ,",
    "plausible masses could be explained if other parameters in the model , e.g. @xmath118 , take appropriate values .",
    "besides this neutrino - specific model has other phenomenological motivations ( e.g. @xmath244 decays , cosmology and neutrino phenomenology ) , in our case , this has been used to determine the nature of mdm and the relation with small sizable masses in the neutrino sector .",
    "for instance , neutrino specific-2hdm gives characteristic scales up to @xmath245 @xmath3 for @xmath240-mdm ( even respecting the perturbative limit on yukawa couplings ) .",
    "higher values in mdm for the neutrino - specific model are due to yukawa couplings structure , which scales with the ratio between neutrino mass and @xmath48 . the last fact is a radical difference with the remaining yukawa couplings structures of other considered 2hdms . under the assumption of normal ordering for neutrinos , these scales for mdms are above of sm contributions and reach the threshold measurement , making of neutrino specific a great scenario to constrain new physics in future experiments .    an important aspect is the close relationship of mdms with the neutrino mass and with the respectively charged lepton mass . in the type i - iii 2hdms , this can be clearly appreciated when the contribution due to the tau neutrino is compared concerning the muon and electron neutrinos ones , further strengthened by the normal hierarchy that we are assuming .",
    "another relevant fact is that if we found magnetic dipole moment for neutrinos , such a measure would be highly sensitive to the type of 2hdm .",
    "however , at precision order we are working to neutrino mdms , lepton - specific analyses are the same that type ii ones . moreover , the flipped model shares the same remarks that case for type i-2hdm .",
    "therefore , we have studied the influence on neutrinos - mdms of all possible 2hdms with natural flavor conservation .    in conclusion , @xmath205-mdm could be converted into a plausible framework to constrain new physics scenarios contributing to electromagnetic form factors .",
    "particularly , in the light of future experiments for coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering , which are expected to improve all bounds on neutrino electromagnetic properties @xcite . particularly , and despite perturbativity could be in conflict with lower values of the natural vev @xmath48 , the neutrino specific model would be a significant benchmark to introduce these effects of new physics , at the same time that neutrino masses are at one viable scale .",
    "this mechanism leads to a well - motivated study of 2hdms itself or implemented under more robust theories ( e.g. @xmath246 gauge extended plus 2hdms or susy models ) containing a compatible explanation of smallness for neutrino masses and the influence of @xmath5 phases in neutrino - phenomenology . in these scenarios ,",
