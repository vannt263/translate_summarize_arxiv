    "diffuse continuum @xmath0-rays  from the interstellar medium are potentially able to reveal much about the sources and propagation of cosmic rays ( cr ) , but in practice the exploitation of this well - known connection is problematic . while the basic processes governing the cr propagation and production of diffuse emission seem to be well - established , some puzzles remain . in particular , the spectrum of @xmath0-rays  calculated under the assumption that the proton and electron spectra in the galaxy resemble those measured locally reveals an excess above 1 gev in the egret spectrum @xcite .",
    "the galactic diffuse continuum @xmath0-rays  are produced in energetic interactions of nucleons with gas via neutral pion production , and by electrons via inverse compton ( ic ) scattering and bremsstrahlung .",
    "these processes are dominant in different parts of the spectrum , and therefore if deciphered the spectrum can provide information about the large - scale spectra of nucleonic and leptonic components of cr . in turn , having an improved understanding of the galactic diffuse emission and the role of cr is essential for unveiling the spectra of other components of the diffuse emission and is thus of critical importance for the study of many topics in astronomy , both galactic and extragalactic .",
    "the puzzle of the `` gev excess '' has lead to an attempt to re - evaluate the reaction of @xmath1-production in @xmath2-interactions .",
    "however , a calculation made using modern monte carlo event generators to simulate _ high - energy _",
    "@xmath2-collisions has shown @xcite that the flux agrees rather well with previous calculations .",
    "a flatter galactic nucleon spectrum has been suggested as a possible solution to the `` gev excess '' problem @xcite . explaining the excess requires an ambient proton spectrum power - law index of about 2.42.5 , compared to 2.75 measured locally ( for a summary of recent data see * ? ? ?",
    "such large variations in the proton spectrum are , however , improbable .",
    "a sensitive test of the large - scale - average proton spectrum has been proposed by @xcite based on the fact that secondary antiprotons and @xmath0-rays  are produced in the same @xmath2-interactions .",
    "the secondary antiprotons sample the proton spectrum in a large region of the galaxy , and a flatter nucleon spectrum in distant regions would lead to overproduction of secondary antiprotons and positrons .",
    "the `` hard nucleon spectrum '' hypothesis has effectively been excluded by recent measurements of @xmath3 ratio at high energies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , new accurate measurements of the local proton and helium spectrum allow less freedom for deviations in the @xmath1-decay  component .",
    "a `` hard electron spectrum '' hypothesis has been investigated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "an essential idea of this approach is that the locally - measured cr spectrum of electrons is not a good constraint because of the spatial fluctuations due to energy losses and the stochastic nature of the sources in space and time ; the average interstellar electron spectrum responsible for @xmath0-rays  via ic emission ( and bremsstrahlung ) can therefore be quite different from that measured locally .",
    "an extensive study of this hypothesis has been made by @xcite ; in this model a less dramatic but essential modification of the proton and helium spectrum ( for the @xmath1-decay  component ) was also required .",
    "the latter was still consistent with the locally - observed proton spectrum , as it should be since the proton fluctuations are expected to be small @xcite as the result of their negligible energy losses .",
    "the `` hard electron spectrum '' hypothesis suffers however from the following problems :    * it is hardly compatible with the local electron spectrum _ even _ considering the fluctuations due to stochastic sources and energy losses , as shown by a 3d time - dependent study @xcite ; * the fit to the shape of the spectrum is still poor above 1 gev @xcite ; * it can not reproduce the spectrum in the inner and outer galaxy and intermediate / high latitudes simultaneously @xcite ;    these problems were already evident before the present study , but now we show in addition that    * it predicts significantly higher intensities than the egret data above 10 gev .",
    "another suggestion which has been made @xcite is that the spectrum contains a contribution from accelerated particles confined in snr .",
    "the snr proton and electron spectra , being much harder than the interstellar cr spectra , produce @xmath1-decay  and ic @xmath0-rays  adding to the apparently diffuse @xmath0-rays , while the snrs themselves are too distant to be resolved into individual sources .",
    "an alternative model involving spatial variation of the cr propagation conditions has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "a shortcoming of previous analyses was that the comparison with egret data was limited to particular regions , and the rich egret data have remained not fully exploited .",
    "@xcite made an extensive comparison of the spectra near the galactic plane @xmath4 .",
    "other analyses have concentrated on particular molecular clouds : ophiuchus @xcite , orion @xcite , cepheus and perseus @xcite , monoceros @xcite , high latitudes @xcite .",
    "the previous analysis by @xcite was limited to the inner galaxy at low latitudes , and profiles integrated over large regions of longitude or latitude . in that study , we compared a range of models , based on our cr propagation code galprop , with data from the compton gamma ray observatory .",
    "relative to the work of @xcite we emphasized the connection with cr propagation theory and the importance of ic emission , and less to fitting to structural details of the galactic plane .",
    "the study confirmed that it is rather easy to get agreement within a factor @xmath52 from a few mev to 10 gev with a `` conventional '' set of parameters , however , the data quality warrant considerably better fits .    in the present paper",
    "we attempt to exploit the fact that the models predict quite specific behaviour for different sky regions and this provides a critical test : the `` correct '' model should be consistent with the data in _ all _ directions .",
    "we show that a new model , with less dramatic changes of electron and nucleon spectra relative to the `` conventional '' model , can well reproduce the data .",
    "the changes consist in renormalization of the _ intensities _ of the electron and proton spectra , and a relatively small modification of the proton spectrum at _ low _ energies .",
    "the model is compatible with locally observed particle spectra considering the expected level of spatial fluctuations in the galaxy .",
    "we extend the data comparisons over the entire sky and to 100 gev in energy .",
    "we also exploit the recent improved measurements of the local proton , helium , as well as antiproton , and positron spectra which are used as constraints on the proton spectrum in distant regions .",
    "our approach differs from that of @xcite in that it is based on a model of cr propagation while @xcite use cr - gas coupling and a relatively small ic component .",
    "it is also different from @xcite in that it is based on a physical model , while that work was based on model - fitting to gas surveys to determine the emissivity spectrum as a function of galactocentric radius .",
    "the current study concentrates on spectral aspects of the emission ; the question of the cr source gradient and the distribution of molecular hydrogen is addressed in @xcite .",
    "the selection of a good model for the diffuse galactic emission is critical to another topic , the extragalactic background ( egrb ) .",
    "we have argued in @xcite and @xcite that ic from a large halo can make up a substantial fraction of the high - latitude emission and hence reduce the residual egrb  ( and modify its spectrum relative to * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in a companion paper",
    "@xcite we present a comprehensive discussion of the egrb , with a new estimate which is used in the present paper .",

    "an important point to note is that even in the 2d case , the symmetry applies only to the cr distribution ; for the gas - related components ( @xmath1-decay  and bremsstrahlung ) of the skymaps we use 21-cm line survey data for h i  and co ( @xmath11 ) survey data for h@xmath12 , in the form of column densities for galactocentric `` rings , '' using velocity information and a rotation curve ( see appendix for details ) . in this way details of galactic structure",

    "these explanations are therefore by themselves insufficient , although they could give a contribution .",

    "we find that an injection spectrum of electrons with a steepening from 1.5 to 2.42 at 20 gev ( see table [ model_parameters1 ] ) produces sufficient curvature in the inverse compton spectrum to explain the observed shape of the spectrum , _ provided the electron spectrum is suitable normalized upwards by a factor of about 4 relative to the locally observed spectrum_. the proton injection spectrum is also normalized upward , by a factor 1.8 ; it has the same shape as for the electrons , as a function of rigidity , but the break energy is 10 gev instead of 20 gev .",

    "there we proposed that a contribution from compact sources is the most likely explanation .",
    "recent results from integral @xcite indeed indicate a large contribution from sources in the hard x - ray band , and this would be consistent with the mev region marking a transition from source - dominated to diffuse - dominated ridge emission .",
    "a sensitive test of the proton spectrum using the @xmath3 ratio has been proposed @xcite based on the fact that secondary antiprotons and @xmath0-rays  are produced in the same @xmath2-interactions .",
    "positrons are also produced in @xmath2-collisions and thus may be used to support the conclusions made from the antiproton test . while some deviation from the locally - observed spectrum of primary protons is acceptable , secondary antiprotons ( and partly positrons ) trace the primary proton spectrum on scales up to @xmath510 kpc over the galaxy , and hence allow us to put limits on deviations from the local measurements .    antiprotons and positrons were originally used to exclude the possibility of a hard proton spectrum as the origin of the gev excess @xcite .",
    "however , even for a conventional nucleon spectrum , a problem appears in the reacceleration model in the simultaneous fitting of secondary / primary nuclei ratios and the antiproton spectrum ; the former fixes the propagation parameters which can be used to predict antiprotons , but using the measured proton spectrum leads to too few antiprotons . to reproduce both the secondary / primary nuclei ratios and the antiproton spectrum , @xcite suggested a change in the propagation mode at low energies .",
    "@xcite proposed a contribution to the primary cr spectrum from the `` local bubble '' as a possible solution .",
    "our present model provides an alternative to these solutions .    as was noted in @xcite and (",
    "* and references therein ) , the `` gev excess '' in @xmath0-rays  and underproduction of antiprotons in the reacceleration model may indicate that the nucleon spectrum typical of large regions of the galaxy differs moderately from the local measurements .",
    "the problem with secondary antiprotons in the reacceleration model has been extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is apparent that if the solution of the gev excess can not be found in modifications of the electron spectrum alone , the required modifications in the nucleon spectrum must satisfy the constraints from both antiprotons and positrons .",
    "fig : pbars ] and [ fig : positrons ] show the antiproton and positron fluxes as calculated in the conventional and optimized models .",
    "the modifications of the nucleon spectrum introduced in the optimized model appear to be exactly what is required to reproduce both , antiproton and diffuse data , and the positron spectrum also agrees at high energies . at low energies",
    "the calculated positron spectrum is rather high but the solar modulation is a factor of @xmath51000 at these energies , and besides the scatter in the positron data may indicate large systematic errors .",
    "secondary positrons in cr produced in interactions of energetic nucleons with interstellar gas are usually considered a minor component of cr .",
    "this is indeed so in the heliosphere where the positron to all - lepton ratio is small at all energies , @xmath43 .",
    "however , the secondary positron flux in the interstellar medium is comparable to the electron flux at relatively low energies @xmath51 gev because of the steeper spectrum of secondary positrons .",

    "more dramatic is the case of bremsstrahlung , where secondaries contribute about 60% of the total below @xmath5200 mev .",
    "it is the contribution of secondaries which improves the agreement with data below some 100 mev .",
    "however the secondaries are not sufficient to explain the excess in the 130 mev range observed by comptel , so that an additional point - source contribution to the emission is still required here @xcite .",
    "evidence for such a point source contribution has indeed recently been found by integral @xcite .",
    "we do not discuss here possible calculation errors .",
    "derivation of such errors is a very complicated matter given the many uncertainties in the input .",
    "those most probable are the uncertainties in the @xmath1-production in @xmath2-collisions at relatively _ low _ energies , nuclear cross sections , gas distribution in the galaxy , isrf , systematic errors in the cr measurements , heliospheric modulation , etc .",

    "the hadrin code , which is designed to reproduce nuclear collisions at laboratory energies below 5 gev and describes the threshold and resonance behavior of inelastic hadron - nucleon interactions , shows good agreement with isobar model calculations @xcite at proton kinetic energy @xmath44 gev .",
    "the isobar model is shown to reproduce the data on the secondary @xmath1-production at low energies , in particular , at @xmath45 gev ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the data on @xmath1-production at gev energies are now 40 years old , they have large statistical errors and are very scattered indicating possibly large systematic uncertainties . given the lack of new data , the deviations from the isobar model calculations by a factor of @xmath52 would be also consistent with the old data",
    ". however , the comparison to the galactic diffuse emission is now rather precise , and the uncertainty in the @xmath1-production at low energies may be critical .",
    "our required flattening of the proton spectrum below 10 gev could thus be understood as a compensation for errors in the @xmath1-production physics . at high energies ,",
    "a comparison of @xcite and @xcite scaling model with resuls of pythia and fritiof shows generally a good agreement , but all of them overpredict the cross sections at high rapidities .",

    "[ fig : spectrum_secondary],width=340 ]    possible errors in the cross section of the cr nuclei affect the derived propagation parameters such the diffusion coefficient , alfvn speed etc . while they may be important for calculation of cr isotopic abundances",
    ", they do not affect much the calculation of the diffuse @xmath0-rays  as we normalize the particle spectra to the given local values .",
    "errors in the galactic gas distribution are not so important in the case of stable and long - lived nuclei .",
    "such errors are compensated simultaneously for all species by the corresponding adjustment of the propagation parameters ( diffusion coefficient ) . in case of @xmath0-rays , we compare with the large sky regions so that the error in the column density in any particular direction produces a minor effect .    for the calculation of the spectrum of @xmath0-rays  arising from ic scattering and electron energy losses , the full isrf as function of position and wavelength",
    "is required , which was not available in the literature .",
    "the isrf was evaluated in @xcite using emissivities based on stellar populations and dust emission .",
    "given the complicated and uncertain input in this calculation a factor of two error is quite possible .",
    "the inaccuracies in the isrf are compensated in our model by adjustment of the cr electron flux .",
    "therefore , if the isrf energy density is in reality higher , it will result in lower normalization of the electron injection spectrum making it closer to the local one .",
    "our knowledge of the heliospheric modulation is still incomplete , and it remains the source of a large uncertainty in the propagation models . over the last years ulysses made its measurements at different heliolatitudes so we know more about the solar magnetic field configuration and the solar wind velocity distribution .",
    "however the modulation parameters are usually still determined based on the assumed _ ad hoc _ interstellar nucleon spectrum .",
    "estimates of the modulation made using the simplest force - field approximation show that the modulation changes the proton intensity below 1 gev by a factor of 10 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : protons ] ) , and by a factor of 1001000 in case of electrons and positrons ( figs .",
    "[ fig : electrons ] , [ fig : positrons ] ) .",
    "this makes it difficult to speculate about the reasons for deviations of the calculated spectrum from the measured one by a factor of a few at _ low _ energies .",
    "modulation is important at energies below @xmath510 gev / nucleon , while it is negligible at higher energies .",
    "the @xmath0-rays  with energy @xmath3310 gev are produced by protons of @xmath33100 gev and by electrons of @xmath3310 gev where modulation has ( almost ) no effect .",
    "lower energy @xmath0-rays  may be affected by the uncertainties in the solar modulation , but this is compensated by the adjustment of the interstellar spectra . in our optimized model ,",
    "the diffuse @xmath0-rays  themselves are used to constrain the interstellar particle spectra at low energies , while the constraints from the local measurements are relaxed .",
    "finally , due to the random nature of sn explosions the cr spectrum fluctuates in space and time ( see simulations in * ? ? ?",
    "further , since more cr sources are concentrated in the spiral arms ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the cr intensity in the arms might be higher , while the sun is located in the interarm region .",
    "these effects can cause the locally measured cr intensity to differ from the large - scale average by the required factor of 24 .",
    "we do not discuss here possible calculation errors .",
    "derivation of such errors is a very complicated matter given the many uncertainties in the input , such as the cross sections , gas distribution in the galaxy , isrf , systematic errors in the cr measurements , heliospheric modulation , etc .",
    "some possible errors and their effects have been discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we qualitatively mention what we think may affect our conclusions and what may not .",
    "we have revisited the compatibility of diffuse galactic continuum models with the egret data .",
    "we confirm that the `` conventional model '' based on the locally observed electron spectrum is inadequate , for all sky regions .",
    "a conventional model plus hard sources in the inner galaxy is also inadequate , since this can not explain the excess outside of the galactic plane .",
    "models with a hard electron injection spectrum , while reproducing the egret spectrum in the few gev region over much of the sky , are not compatible with the locally observed electron spectrum ( the expected fluctuations are not sufficient ) and are inconsistent with egret data above 10 gev .    a new model , with relatively mild deviations of the electron and proton spectra from local , is shown give a good reproduction of the diffuse sky .",
    "the agreement extends from 30 mev to 100 gev .",
    "it also gives a very good representation of the latitude distribution of the emission from the plane to the poles , and of the longitude distribution .",
    "ic emission is a major component of the diffuse emission and dominates outside the galactic plane and at energies below 100 mev .",
    "the model reproduces simultaneously the @xmath0-rays , synchrotron , cr secondary / primary ratios , antiprotons and positrons . in this sense",
    "it goes a long way towards realizing our original goal , stated in @xcite , to reproduce astronomical and directly - measured data on cosmic rays in the context of a single model of the high - energy galaxy .",
    "obviously our optimized model is far from unique , both in the choice of parameters like halo size , diffusion coefficient , source gradient , cosmic - ray spectra etc .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to show that it is possible to construct at least one model which is consistent with all the relevant data within understandable limits on cr fluctuations and solar modulation .",
