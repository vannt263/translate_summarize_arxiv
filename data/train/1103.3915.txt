    "physical - layer security provides secure communication between desired users by taking advantages of various physical channel characteristics .",
    "the study of physical - layer security dates back to wyner s seminal paper  @xcite , in which he introduced the _ wiretap channel _ model . in a wiretap channel",
    ", a source tries to send secret information to a destination in the presence of a wiretapper .",
    "when the wiretapper channel is a degraded version of the destination channel , wyner  @xcite described a code design based on group codes such that the source can transmit messages at a positive rate to the destination .",
    "this degradedness condition was removed in  @xcite , which showed that a positive secrecy rate is possible for the case where the destination channel is `` less noisy '' than the wiretapper channel .",
    "generalization of wyner s work to the gaussian wiretap channel was considered in  @xcite . in  @xcite ,",
    "a code design based on coset codes was suggested for the type - ii ( the destination channel is error free ) binary erasure wiretap channel .",
    "reference  @xcite considered the design of secure nested codes for type - ii wiretap channels .",
    "recently , references  @xcite and @xcite concurrently established the result that polar codes  @xcite can achieve the secrecy capacity of the degraded binary - input symmetric - output ( biso ) wiretap channels",
    ".    low - density parity - check ( ldpc ) codes have emerged as potential practical candidates for providing reliable and secure communication over wiretap channels .",
    "first , ldpc codes provide excellent `` close - to - capacity '' performance with reasonable encoding / decoding complexity  @xcite .",
    "second , there exists powerful tools like density evolution  @xcite for asymptotic analysis and code design of ldpc codes .",
    "for example , the authors of  @xcite constructed ldpc based wiretap codes for the binary erasure channel ( bec ) and the binary symmetric channel ( bsc ) . in  @xcite , multilevel coding / multistage decoding using ldpc codes has been proposed for the quasi - static rayleigh fading wiretap channel . in  @xcite ,",
    "punctured ldpc codes were employed in a coding scheme that aims at reducing the security gap of the gaussian wiretap channel . in  @xcite , further reductions in the security gap are achieved using non - systematic ldpc code obtained by scrambling the information bits prior to ldpc encoding .    in this paper , we design ldpc codes for sending secret messages over the gaussian wiretap channel with binary phase - shift keyed ( bpsk ) source symbols .",
    "this work is inspired by the results in  @xcite on secret key agreement over the same wiretap channel , with the availability of an additional public feedback channel .",
    "in particular , theorem  2 of  @xcite can be modified to show the existence of regular ldpc code ensembles with increasing block lengths that achieve secrecy capacity  @xcite of the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel .",
    "based on this observation , we propose a coding scheme which employs irregular ldpc codes  @xcite with finite block lengths to support practical secret transmission over the gaussian wiretap channel .",
    "the proposed coding structure allows efficient design of irregular ldpc codes that give good secrecy performance as measured in terms of equivocation about the secret message at the wiretapper .",
    "this design constitutes the main technical contribution of the present paper .",
    "we note that codes suggested in  @xcite can be considered as unoptimized special cases of the proposed coding scheme .",
    "a more detailed comparison will be given in the sequel .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "introduces the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel .",
    "the proposed coding scheme will be discussed in detail in  . in  , we describe a code search algorithm based on density evolution analysis to obtain good irregular codes for use in the proposed coding scheme .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in  .",
    "we consider the wiretap channel model in which the source tries to send a secret message to the destination via an additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) channel in the presence of a wiretapper .",
    "the wiretapper intends to reconstruct the message by listening to the transmission through another independent awgn channel .",
    "the secret message @xmath0 is encoded into a transmitted sequence @xmath1 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 denote the corresponding received sequences at the destination and wiretapper , respectively .",
    "we restrict the source to transmit only bpsk symbols , i.e. @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the two usual elements in gf(2 ) . ] .",
    "then the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel can be modeled as @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "zero - mean gaussian random variables of variance @xmath11 .",
    "note that @xmath12 is the gain of the bpsk symbols transmitted by the source .",
    "we impose the source power constraint @xmath13 such that @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the maximum power available to the source .",
    "also , @xmath16 is a positive constant that models the gain advantage of the wiretapper over the destination .",
    "let the ( noise ) normalized gain be @xmath17 , then the received signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) at the destination and wiretapper are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "assuming a uniform message distribution , the rate of the secret message is @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 denote the estimate of the message at the destination .",
    "the level of knowledge of the wiretapper possesses about the secret message can be quantified by the equivocation rate @xmath22 .",
    "a rate - equivocation pair @xmath23 is achievable if for all @xmath24 , there exists a rate-@xmath25 code sequence such that    1 .",
    "@xmath26 , and 2 .",
    "@xmath27    for sufficiently large @xmath28 .",
    "when the equivocation rate at the wiretapper is as large as the secret message rate , i.e. @xmath29 , we say that the equivocation - rate pair is achievable with _ perfect secrecy",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "capacity - equivocation region _ of a wiretap channel contains all achievable rate - equivocation pairs @xmath23 .",
    "when @xmath30 , specializing the result in  @xcite shows that the capacity - equivocation region of the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel is given by @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the channel capacity of awgn channel with bpsk input .",
    "the _ secrecy capacity _ of the wiretap channel is defined as the maximum secret message rate such that the condition of perfect secrecy is satisfied . for the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel , the secrecy capacity",
    "is given by @xmath34 if @xmath30 .",
    "we note that @xmath34 is achieved when @xmath35 is equiprobable ; but it is not necessarily achieved by transmitting at the maximum allowable power @xmath15 .",
    "[ fig : cb ] shows the plot of @xmath34 , in units of bits per ( wiretap ) channel use ( bpcu ) , versus the maximum allowable snr @xmath36 for @xmath37 and @xmath38  db , respectively .     of the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel for different value of @xmath39.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "in this section , we describe the proposed coding scheme for the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel . inspired by our previous work  @xcite on secret key agreement over the same wiretap channel , the proposed coding scheme employs irregular ldpc codes and its secrecy performance will be evaluated by measuring the equivocation rate of the secret message at the wiretapper .",
    "similar to  @xcite , we start with an @xmath40 _ secret binary linear block code _ defined by the pair @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an @xmath43 binary linear block code with @xmath44 distinct codewords of length @xmath28 and @xmath45 is an @xmath46-dimensional subspace in @xmath42 . the ratios @xmath47 and",
    "@xmath48 will be referred to as the _ code rate _ and _ secret rate _ of @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the pair @xmath41 will be employed to support practical secret transmission over the wiretap channel .",
    "we take the following considerations into account when choosing @xmath41 .",
    "first , the choice of @xmath41 should admit efficient encoder and decoder in order to make the proposed coding scheme practically implementable .",
    "second , the choice of @xmath41 should avoid transmitting the secret message @xmath49 `` directly '' through the channel since such `` direct '' transmission is undesirable .",
    "third , the choice of @xmath41 should permit a design procedure based on which `` good '' codes can be obtained .    to satisfy these considerations , we choose an @xmath50 linear block code @xmath51 from an ensemble of irregular ldpc codes , where @xmath52 .",
    "then the pair @xmath41 is chosen as follows .",
    "let @xmath53 be the parity - check matrix associated with @xmath51 and assume @xmath54 $ ] where @xmath55 is an @xmath56 lower triangular matrix .",
    "let @xmath57 $ ] where @xmath58a^t(b^{-1})^t$ ] denote a codeword of @xmath51 .",
    "then the @xmath43 linear block code @xmath42 is chosen to be set of codewords obtained by removing @xmath59 from @xmath60 .",
    "that is , @xmath42 is a punctured version of @xmath51 .",
    "the subspace @xmath45 is chosen to be the subset of ( punctured ) codewords obtained by setting @xmath59 to zero .",
    "the coding scheme employing the pair @xmath41 is as follows :    1 .   *",
    "encoding : * the source sets @xmath59 to be the @xmath61-bits secret message @xmath49 and chooses @xmath62 randomly according to a uniform distribution . then it calculates @xmath63a^t(b^{-1})^t$ ] and sends @xmath64 $ ] to the destination through the gaussian wiretap channel .",
    "* decoding : * the destination performs belief propagation ( bp ) decoding to decode @xmath60 using its channel observation @xmath2 .",
    "the first @xmath61 bits of the decoded codeword give the estimate @xmath21 of the secret message .",
    "we evaluate the secrecy performance of the proposed coding scheme in the context of achievable rate - equivocation pair defined in  .",
    "first , if the bp decoder at the destination achieves error probability @xmath65 , then we have @xmath66 .",
    "hence , condition 1 in   is satisfied if @xmath65 is small enough .",
    "second , the uncertainty about the message @xmath49 at the wiretapper given his received sequence @xmath3 is @xmath67 based on the memoryless nature of the source - to - wiretapper channel and the encoding process , we have @xmath68 , @xmath69   contains @xmath44 distinct codewords , which is in turn the case with very high probability if @xmath70 is chosen randomly in the usual manner described in  @xcite . ] and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "moreover , consider a fictitious receiver at the wiretapper trying to decode for @xmath72 from observing @xmath3 and @xmath49 .",
    "suppose that the average error probability achieved by this receiver is @xmath73 .",
    "then we have @xmath74 by fano s inequality . putting all these back to",
    ", we obtain @xmath75 let @xmath76 , then condition 2 in   is satisfied if @xmath73 is small enough and @xmath28 is large enough .",
    "hence , @xmath23 is an achievable rate - equivocation pair through the bpsk - constrained gaussian wiretap channel .",
    "moreover , we note that the above lower bound is derived from the fano s inequality ; thus it applies to any decoder at the fictitious receiver .",
    "in fact , the value of the bound depends on the choice of decoders only through @xmath73 . in the next section",
    ", we perform computer simulation to estimate @xmath73 and then employ   to bound the equivocation rate achieved by the proposed coding scheme as described above . to get @xmath73 ,",
    "a bp decoder is implemented for the fictitious receiver at the wiretapper . in order to provide information about the secret message @xmath49 to the bp decoder , the intrinsic log - likelihood ratios ( llrs ) of @xmath59",
    "are explicitly set to @xmath77 according to the true bit values .",
    "as mentioned in  , reference  @xcite uses a systematic irregular ldpc code to encode the secret message @xmath49 ( along with some random bits ) and then punctures the secret message bits in the codeword prior to transmission in order to `` hide '' the secret message from the wiretapper .",
    "the puncturing pattern is designed to minimize the security gap .",
    "such a coding scheme can be viewed as an unoptimized special case of our scheme proposed in .",
    "we show in this section that the generalization in   allows us to systematically optimize the irregular ldpc code for good secrecy performance . to that end , let us apply the code search process proposed in  @xcite to the present case .",
    "our objective is to design the irregular ldpc code @xmath70 and a puncturing scheme so that the secret ldpc code @xmath41 works well for both the channel from the source to the destination and the channel from the source to the wiretapper ( given the secret message ) .",
    "let us first consider uniform puncturing of the systematic bits of @xmath70 , with @xmath78 denoting the corresponding fraction of punctured variable nodes .",
    "note that the secret rate @xmath79 . also , write the rate of @xmath70 as @xmath80 . then @xmath81 . for any fixed @xmath25 ,",
    "the discussion just below at the end of the previous section suggests that we should maximize @xmath82 , or equivalently @xmath83 , in order to maximize the achievable equivocation rate .",

    ", the design objective is to then find @xmath90 and @xmath91 that maximize the code rate @xmath92 subject to the constraint that both @xmath65 and @xmath73 vanish as the bp decoders iterate .",

    "let @xmath101 denote the similar quantity for bit error probability obtained at the wiretapper .",

    "let @xmath104 be a small prescribed error tolerance .",
    "suppose that @xmath105 satisfies the property that @xmath106 and @xmath107 , for some integers @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "then , we can frame the @xmath82-maximizing code design problem as the following linear program : @xmath110 \\\\ &   \\hspace*{0.2in}\\mbox{and~ } \\sum_{j=2}^{d_v } a_{\\ell , j } \\lambda_j \\leq e_s(\\ell-1 ) ,   & & \\mbox{for~}1 \\leq \\ell \\leq m_s \\\\ &   \\left |\\sum_{j=2}^{d_v } b_{\\ell , j } \\lambda_j - e_w(\\ell)\\right| \\leq \\max   [ 0 , & &   \\hspace*{-1.3em}\\delta ( e_w(\\ell-1)-e_w(\\ell ) ) ] ,   \\\\ &   \\hspace*{0.2in}\\mbox{and~ } \\sum_{j=2}^{d_v } b_{\\ell , j } \\lambda_j \\leq e_w(\\ell-1 ) ,   & & \\mbox{for~}1 \\leq \\ell \\leq m_w , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 here is the maximum allowable degree of @xmath90 and @xmath111 is a small positive number . the solution @xmath90 of the above linear program is then employed as the initial @xmath98 for the next search round .",

    "the iterative search can then alternate between the linear programs for @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .    for illustration ,",
