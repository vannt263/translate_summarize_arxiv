    "the environments of quasars provide important clues to the physical processes of their formation and also yield important information about the relations between the distribution of quasars and the large - scale structure of the universe . for more than three decades",
    ", we have known that quasars are associated with enhancements in the spatial distributions of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "studies of the environments of quasars in the nearby universe ( @xmath2 ) have shown that quasars reside in environments ranging from small to moderate groups of galaxies rather than in rich clusters ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in order to interpret the observational results of the environments of quasars at low redshifts and predict the environments of quasars at high redshifts , a physical model of quasar formation based on cosmological context",
    "is required .",
    "it has become widely accepted that quasars are fueled by accretion of gas onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the nuclei of host galaxies since @xcite proposed this idea on quasars .",
    "recent observations of galactic centers suggest that a lot of nearby galaxies have central black holes and their estimated masses correlate with the luminosities of spheroids of their host galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the connection between smbhs and their host spheroids suggests that the formation of smbhs physically links the formation of the spheroids which harbor the smbhs .",
    "thus , this implies that the formation of quasars is closely related to the formation of galaxies , especially of spheroids .",
    "therefore , in order to study the formation and evolution of quasars , it is necessary to construct a unified model which includes both galaxy formation and quasar formation .",
    "recently , some authors have tried to construct galaxy formation models on the basis of the theory of hierarchical structure formation in cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe .",
    "these efforts are referred to as semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation . in the cdm universe ,",
    "dark matter halos cluster gravitationally and merge together in a manner that depends on the adopted power spectrum of initial density fluctuations . in each of the merged dark halos ,",
    "radiative gas cooling , star formation , and supernova feedback occur .",
    "the cooled dense gas and stars constitute _ galaxies_. these galaxies sometimes merge together in a common dark halo and more massive galaxies form . in sams , the merger trees of dark matter halos are constructed using a monte - carlo algorithm and simple models are adopted to describe the above gas processes .",
    "stellar population synthesis models are used to calculate the luminosities and colors of model galaxies .",
    "it is therefore straightforward to understand how galaxies form and evolve within the context of this model .",
    "sams successfully have reproduced a variety of observed features of local galaxies such as their luminosity functions , color distribution , and so on ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite , ; @xcite ; @xcite , ) .    in these models",
    ", it is assumed that disk stars are formed by cooling of gas in the halo .",
    "if two galaxies of comparable mass merge , it is assumed that starbursts occur and form the spheroidal component in the center of the galaxy .",
    "@xmath3-body simulations have shown that a merger hypothesis for the origin of spheroids can explain their detailed internal structure ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite , ; @xcite ) .",
    "kauffmann and charlot ( ) have demonstrated that the merger scenario for the formation of elliptical galaxies is consistent with the color - magnitude relation and its redshift evolution ( see also @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "hydrodynamical simulations have shown that a merger of galaxies drives gas to fall rapidly to the center of a merged system and to fuel nuclear starburst ( @xcite ; @xcite , ; @xcite ) . moreover ,",
    "observed images of quasar hosts show that many quasars reside in interacting systems or elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it has often been thought that the major merger of galaxies would be a possible mechanism for quasar and spheroid formation .",
    "so far , a lot of studies on quasar evolution based on the hierarchical clustering scenario have been carried out with the assumption that the formation of quasars is linked to the first collapse of dark matter halos with galactic mass and that these models can explain the decline of quasar number density at @xmath4 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) and properties of luminosity functions of quasars ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . however ,",
    "if quasars are directly linked to spheroids of host galaxies rather than to dark matter halos , the approximation of a one - to - one relation between quasar hosts and dark matter halos would be very crude , especially at low redshift .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to construct a model related to spheroid formation and smbh formation directly .",
    "kauffmann and haehnelt ( ) introduced a unified model of the evolution of galaxies and quasars within the framework of sam ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "they assumed that smbhs are formed and fueled during major galaxy mergers and their model reproduces quantitatively the observed relation between spheroid luminosity and black hole mass in nearby galaxies , the strong evolution of the quasar population with redshift , and the relation between the luminosities of nearby quasars and those of their host galaxies .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate properties of quasar environments , using a sam incorporated simple quasar evolution model .",
    "we assume that smbhs are formed and fueled during major galaxy mergers and the fueling process leads quasar activity .",
    "while this assumption is similar to the model of kauffmann and haehnelt ( ) , our galaxy formation model and the adopted model of fueling process are different from their model . here",
    "we focus on optical properties of quasars and attempt to consider the number of quasars per halo , effective bias parameter of quasars and the number of galaxies around quasars as characterizations of environments of quasars , because a ) these quantities provide a direct measure of bias in their distribution with respect to galaxies and b ) comparing results of the model with observations will enable us to constrain our quasar formation model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ model ] we briefly review our sam for galaxy formation ; in  [ qsomodel ] we introduce the quasar formation model ; in  [ env ] we calculate the galaxy number distribution function around quasars ; in  [ disc ] we provide a summary and discussion .    in this study",
    ", we use a low - density , spatially flat cold dark matter ( @xmath5cdm ) universe with the present density parameter @xmath6 , the cosmological constant @xmath7 , the hubble constant in units of @xmath8 @xmath9 and the present rms density fluctuation in spheres of @xmath10 radius @xmath11 .",
    "in this section we briefly describe our sam for the galaxy formation model , details of which are shown in @xcite .",
    "our present sam analysis obtains essentially the same results as the previous sam analyses , with minor differences in a number of details .",
    "first , we construct monte carlo realizations of merging histories of dark matter halos using the method of @xcite , which is based on the extended press - schechter formalism ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt the power spectrum for the specific cosmological model from @xcite .",
    "halos with circular velocity @xmath1240 km  s@xmath13 are treated as diffuse accretion matter .",
    "the evolution of the baryonic component is followed until the output redshift coincides with the redshift interval of @xmath14 , corresponding to the dynamical time scale of halos which collapse at the redshift @xmath15 .",
    "note that @xcite recently pointed out that a much shorter timestep is required to correctly reproduce the mass function given by the press - schechter formalism .",
    "however , a serious problem exists only at small mass scales ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "thus we use the above prescription of timestep .",
    "if a dark matter halo has no progenitor halos , the mass fraction of the gas in the halo is given by @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the baryonic density parameter constrained by primordial nucleosynthesis calculations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "note that a recent measurement of the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background by the boomerang project suggests a slight higher value , @xmath19 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite have already investigated the effect of changing @xmath20 and showed that this mainly affects the value of the invisible stellar mass fraction such as brown dwarfs parameterized by @xmath21 ( see below ) . when a dark matter halo collapses , the gas in the halo is shock - heated to the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "we refer to this heated gas as the _ hot gas_. at the same time , the gas in dense regions of the halo cools due to efficient radiative cooling .",
    "we call this cooled gas the",
    "_ cold gas_. assuming a singular isothermal density distribution of the hot gas and using the metallicity - dependent cooling function by @xcite , we calculate the amount of cold gas which eventually falls onto a central galaxy in the halo . in order to avoid the formation of",
    "unphysically large galaxies , the above cooling process is applied only to halos with @xmath12400 km  s@xmath13 .",
    "this handling would be needed because the simple isothermal distribution forms so - called `` monster galaxies '' due to the too efficient cooling at the center of halos . while this problem will probably solved by adopting another isothermal distribution with central core ( @xcite ) , we take the above approach for simplicity .",
    "stars are formed from the cold gas at a rate of @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the mass of cold gas and @xmath24 is the time scale of star formation .",
    "we assume that @xmath24 is independent of @xmath15 , but dependent on @xmath25 as follows :    @xmath26    the free parameters of @xmath27 and @xmath28 are fixed by matching the observed mass fraction of cold gas in neutral form in the disks of spiral galaxies . in our sam , stars with masses larger than @xmath29 explode as type ii supernovae ( sne ) and heat up the surrounding cold gas .",
    "this sn feedback reheats the cold gas to hot gas at a rate of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the efficiency of reheating .",
    "we assume that @xmath31 depends on @xmath25 as follows : @xmath32 the free parameters of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are determined by matching the local luminosity function of galaxies . with these @xmath35 and @xmath36 thus determined , we obtain the masses of hot gas , cold gas , and disk stars as a function of time during the evolution of galaxies .",
    "given the star formation rate as a function of time , the absolute luminosity and colors of individual galaxies are calculated using a population synthesis code by @xcite .",
    "the initial stellar mass function ( imf ) that we adopt is the power - law imf of salpeter form with lower and upper mass limits of @xmath37m@xmath38 and @xmath39m@xmath38 , respectively .",
    "since our knowledge of the lower mass limit is incomplete , there is the possibility that many brown dwarf - like objects are formed .",
    "therefore , following @xcite , we introduce a parameter defined as @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the total mass of luminous stars with @xmath42 and @xmath43 is that of invisible brown dwarfs . to account for extinction by internal dust",
    "we adopt a simple model by @xcite in which the optical depth in @xmath44-band is related to the luminosity as @xmath45 .",
    "optical depths in other bands are calculated by using the galactic extinction curve , and the dust distribution in disks is assumed to be the slab model considered by @xcite .",
    "when several progenitor halos have merged , the newly formed larger halo should contain at least two or more galaxies which had originally resided in the individual progenitor halos .",
    "we identify the central galaxy in the new common halo with the central galaxy contained in the most massive of the progenitor halos .",
    "other galaxies are regarded as satellite galaxies .",
    "these satellites merge by either dynamical friction or random collision .",
    "the time scale of merging by dynamical friction is given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath25 are the radius and the circular velocity of the new common halo , respectively , @xmath48 is the coulomb logarithm , and @xmath49 is the mass of the satellite galaxy including its dark matter halo @xcite . when the time passed after a galaxy becomes a satellite exceeds @xmath50 , a satellite galaxy infalls onto the central galaxy . on the other hand , the mean free time scale of random collision",
    "is given by @xmath51 where @xmath3 is the number of satellite galaxies , @xmath52 is their radius , and @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the 1d velocity dispersions of the common halo and satellite galaxies , respectively @xcite . with a probability of @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the timestep corresponding to the redshift interval @xmath57 , a satellite galaxy merges with another randomly picked satellite .",
    "consider the case that two galaxies of masses @xmath58 and @xmath59 merge together .",
    "if the mass ratio @xmath60 is larger than a certain critical value of @xmath61 , we assume that a starburst occurs and all the cold gas turns into stars and hot gas , which fills the halo , and all of the stars populate the bulge of a new galaxy . on the other hand , if @xmath62 , no starburst occurs and a smaller galaxy is simply absorbed into the disk of a larger galaxy .",
    "these processes are repeated until the output redshift .",
    "we classify galaxies into different morphological types according to the @xmath44-band bulge - to - disk luminosity ratio @xmath63 . in this paper ,",
    "galaxies with @xmath64 , and @xmath65 are classified as ellipticals / s0s and spirals , respectively .",
    "this method of type classification well reproduces the observed type mix .",
    "the above procedure is a standard one in the sam for galaxy formation .",

    "in this section , we introduce a quasar formation and evolution model into our sam .",
    "as mentioned earlier , the masses of smbhs have tight correlation with the spheroid masses of their host galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the hosts of quasars found in the local universe are giant elliptical galaxies or galaxies displaying evidence of major mergers of galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , in sams for galaxy formation , it is assumed that a galaxy - galaxy major merger leads to the formation of a spheroid .",
    "therefore , we assume that smbhs grow by merging and are fueled by accreted cold gas during major mergers of galaxies .",
    "when host galaxies merge , pre - existing smbhs sink to the center of the new merged galaxy owing to dynamical friction and finally coalesce .",
    "the timescale for this process is unknown , but for the sake of simplicity we assume that smbhs merge instantaneously .",
    "gas - dynamical simulations have demonstrated that the major merger of galaxies can drive substantial gaseous inflows and trigger starburst activity ( @xcite ; @xcite , ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we assume that during major merger , some fraction of the cold gas that is proportional to the total mass of stars newly formed at starburst is accreted onto the newly formed smbh . under this assumption , the mass of cold gas accreted on a smbh is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a constant and @xmath69 is the total mass of stars formed at starburst .",
    "@xmath69 is derived in the appendix .",
    "the free parameter of @xmath68 is fixed by matching the observed relation between a spheroid luminosity and a black hole mass found by @xcite and we find that the favorable value of @xmath68 is nearly @xmath70 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bulge - bh ] we show scatterplots ( open circles ) of the absolute @xmath71-band magnitudes of spheroids versus masses of smbhs of model for @xmath72 .",
    "the thick solid line is the observational relation and the dashed lines are the @xmath73 scatter in the observations obtained by @xcite . for @xmath74 ,",
    "changing @xmath68 shifts the black hole mass almost linearly .",
    "the obtained gas fraction ( @xmath75 ) is so small that the inclusion of smbh formation does not change the properties of galaxies in the local universe . in figure",
    "[ fig : gal - lum ] , the dashed lines show the results of the model with the smbh formation .",
    "this result differs negligibly from the result of the model without smbh formation .",
    "therefore , we use the same astrophysical parameters tabulated in table [ tab : astro ] regardless of inclusion of the smbh formation model . figure [ fig : bh - mass ] ( a )",
    "shows black hole mass functions in our model at a series of redshifts .",
    "this indicates that the number density of the most massive black holes increases monotonically with time in the scenario where smbhs grow by accretion of gas and by merging . in figure",
    "[ fig : bh - mass ] ( a ) , we superpose the present black hole mass function obtained by @xcite .",
    "they derived this black hole mass function from the observed radio luminosity function of nearby radio - quiet galaxies and the empirical correlation between radio luminosities from the nuclei of radio - quiet galaxies and the mass of their black holes .",
    "our model result is consistent with their mass function . for comparison",
    ", we also plot the mass functions of bulge and disk for all galaxies in figure [ fig : bh - mass ] ( b ) and ( c ) , respectively .",
    "the steep slopes at low masses of mass functions of black hole and bulge are mainly due to random collisions between satellite galaxies in this model .    to obtain the observed linear relation between a spheroid luminosity and a black hole mass , kauffmann and haehnelt ( ) adopted model of fueling process in which the ratio of accreted mass to total available cold gas mass scales with halo circular velocity in the same way as the mass of stars formed per unit mass of cooling gas .",
    "while their approach is similar to ours , their star formation and feedback models are different from ours and they do not consider random collisions .",
    "therefore , their resultant model description is slightly differ from ours in equation ( [ eq : bhaccret ] ) .",
    "( 70mm,70mm)fig2.eps    ( 120mm,80mm)fig3.eps    next , we consider the light curve of quasars .",
    "we assume that a fixed fraction of the rest mass energy of the accreted gas is radiated in the @xmath44-band and the quasar life timescale @xmath76 scales with the dynamical time scale @xmath77 of the host galaxy where @xmath78 . here",
    "we adopt the @xmath44-band luminosity of a quasar at time @xmath79 after the major merger as follows ; @xmath80 the peak luminosity @xmath81 is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the radiative efficiency in @xmath44-band , @xmath84 is the quasar life timescale and @xmath85 is the speed of light . in order to determine the parameter @xmath83 and the present quasar life timescale @xmath86 , we have chosen them to match our model luminosity function with the observed abundance of bright quasars at @xmath87 .",
    "we obtain @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the resulting luminosity functions at four different redshifts are shown in figure [ fig : qso - lum ] .",
    "we superpose the luminosity functions derived from the 2df 10k catalogue ( @xcite ) for a cosmology with @xmath90 and @xmath9 , which is analyzed and kindly provided by t. t. takeuchi .",
    "he used the method of @xcite for the estimation of the luminosity functions . in order to reanalyze the error with greater accuracy , they applied bootstrap resampling according to the method of @xcite .",
    "absolute @xmath44-band magnitudes were derived for the quasars using the @xmath91-corrections derived by @xcite .",
    "our model reproduces reasonably well the evolution of observed luminosity functions .",
    "thus , in the next section , we use these model parameters in order to investigate the environments of quasars .    for comparison",
    ", we also plot the result of model with @xmath88 and @xmath92 in figure [ fig : qso - lum ] ( dot - dashed lines ) . in this case",
    ", the abundance of luminous quasars decreases . to prolong a quasar life timescale affects the quasar luminosity function due to the following two factors : a decrease in the peak luminosity @xmath93 ( eq.[[eq : qso - peak ] ] ) and an increase in the exponential factor @xmath94 in equation ( [ eq : qso - lc ] ) . for the majority of bright quasars , the elapsed time @xmath79 since the major merger is much smaller than the quasar life timescale @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "therefore , the former factor dominates the latter and the number of luminous quasars decreases .",
    "thus , a long quasar life timescale results in a very steep quasar luminosity function .",
    "note that if we change the radiative efficiency @xmath83 , the quasar luminosities simply scale by a constant factor in our model .",
    "thus , changing @xmath83 shifts the luminosity function horizontally .",
    "in this section , we investigate the environments of quasars using our model .",
    "we consider the halo mass dependence of the mean number of quasars per halo and the probability distribution of the number of galaxies around quasars as characterizations of the environments of quasars .",
    "this is because the former is one of measures of the relation between quasars and dark matter distributions and the latter reflects the relationship between galaxies and quasars .    in figure",
    "[ fig : number - gal ] , we plot @xmath97 and @xmath98 that denote the mean number of galaxies and quasars per halo with mass @xmath99 , respectively , at ( a ) @xmath100 and ( b ) @xmath101 .",
    "we select galaxies with @xmath102 and quasars with @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is absolute @xmath44-band magnitude .",
    "it should be noted that changing the magnitude of selection criteria for galaxies and quasars would alter these results , but qualitative features are not altered .",
    "as is seen in figure [ fig : number - gal ] , there are more galaxies and quasars at high @xmath15 . at higher redshift , halos have more cold gas available to form stars and to fuel smbhs because there has been relatively little time for star formation to deplete the cold gas at these redshifts .",
    "thus , the number of luminous galaxies grows .",
    "furthermore , at higher redshift , both timescales of the dynamical friction and the random collisions are shorter because the mass density of a halo is higher .",
    "therefore , the galaxy merging rate increases .",
    "consequently , the number of quasars also grows .",
    "moreover , the decrease in the quasar life timescale @xmath105 with redshift also contributes to the increase in the number of quasars because quasars become brighter as a result of decrease in @xmath105 ( eq . [ [ eq : qso - peak ] ] ) .    from figure",
    "[ fig : number - gal ] , we find that the dependence of @xmath106 on halo mass @xmath99 is different from the dependence of @xmath97 .",
    "furthermore , figure [ fig : qg - ratio ] shows that the ratio of @xmath107 to @xmath108 varies with redshift and halo mass .",

    "these results are applicable to the quasar spatial distribution .",

    "the ratio of @xmath107 to @xmath97 varies with halo mass in our model ( fig[fig : number - gal ] ) .",
    "these results of our model suggest that the clustering of galaxies is not the same as the clustering of quasars and the effective bias parameter of quasars and its evolution are different from these of galaxies ( fig.[fig : bias ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we predict the galaxy number distribution function around quasars , @xmath151 ( fig[fig : gnd ] ) . at lower redshifts ( @xmath0 ) , most halos which have quasars have at most several galaxies .",
    "this indicates that most quasars reside in groups of galaxies . on the other hand , at higher redshift ( @xmath152 ) ,",
    "the number of galaxies in the halo with quasars is from several to dozens ; quasars reside in ranging from small groups of galaxies to clusters of galaxies .",
    "these results show that most quasars at higher redshift reside in more varied environments than at lower redshift .",
    "this model prediction is checkable by statistics of galaxies around quasars which will be obtained in future .",
    "it is still controversial whether the environments of quasars depend on their optical and radio luminosities .",
    "some authors have claimed that radio - loud quasars were located in richer environments than radio - quiet quasars at at @xmath153 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , other people obtained a different result .",
    "for example , @xcite observed the galaxy environment of radio - loud quasars and radio - quiet quasars and concluded that there is no significant difference in the richness .",
    "recent studies support this conclusion ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the discrepancies between different studies may be caused partly by too small quasar samples and by differences in sample selection of quasars .",
    "this situation will soon improve with the availability of a new generation of very large quasar surveys such as the 2df quasar redshift survey ( @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "although we do not deal with radio properties of quasars in this paper , our investigation of quasar environments will also provide a clue for understanding the radio character of quasar environments .",
    "the mean number of quasars per halo , @xmath107 , and probability distribution of the number of galaxies around quasars , @xmath151 , used in this study can provide some useful features of the quasar environments .",
    "furthermore , the spatial galaxy - quasar correlation function is used in order to quantify the galaxy environments around a quasar .",
    "therefore , for the further investigation of environments and clustering of quasars and in order to constrain the quasar formation model , it is also necessary to predict spatial distribution of galaxies and quasars .",
    "we will show the results using the combination of cosmological @xmath3-body simulation and sam for formation of galaxy and quasar in the near future .",
    "we would like to thank t. t. takeuchi for providing us with the reanalyzed data of the quasar luminosity functions derived from the 2df 10k catalogue .",
    "we are also grateful to k. okoshi , h. yahagi and s. yoshioka for useful comments and discussions .",
    "we also thank to the anonymous referee for a thorough reading of the manuscript and for his valuable suggestions and comments , which improved our paper very much .",

    "in this appendix , we summarize our model of star formation and gas evolution .",
    "we use a simple instantaneous recycling approximation of model star formation , feedback and chemical enrichment .",
    "the following difference equations describe the evolution of the mass of cold gas @xmath23 , hot gas @xmath154 , and long lived stars @xmath155 at each time step .",
    "@xmath156 where @xmath157 is star formation rate , @xmath158 is the gas fraction returned by evolved stars , and @xmath31 is the efficiency of reheating . in this paper , @xmath159 .",
    "the solutions of these equations are the following : @xmath160 , \\label{eq : coldsol } \\\\",
    "m_{\\rm hot } & = & m_{\\rm hot}^{0 } + \\beta \\delta m _ { * } , \\label{eq : hotsol } \\\\ m_{\\rm star } & = & m_{\\rm star}^{0 } + ( 1-r)\\delta m _ { * } , \\label{eq : starsol } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are the masses of cold gas , hot gas and long - lived stars from the previous time step , @xmath79 is the time sine the start of the time step , and @xmath163 is the mass of total formed stars .",
    "when a starburst occurs , stars are formed in a very short timescale .",
    "thus , the starburst corresponds to @xmath164 in the above solutions . in this case , the changes of masses are given by @xmath165 and the total star mass formed at starburst becomes @xmath166 from equation ( [ eq : totstar ] ) , we can obtain the mass of accreted cold gas onto a black hole ( eq.[[eq : bhaccret ] ] ) ."
