    "despite several decades of intensive research , experimental results on the superhigh energy ( @xmath2 ev = 1 pev ) cosmic ray spectrum and composition are still somewhat controversial .",
    "an uncertainty of the spectral shape is considerable ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , and the results on the nuclear composition obtained by different experiments are often contradictory ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a scatter of results is especially large for the composition studies : various measurements of the mean logarithmic mass number , @xmath3 , at some energy region span almost the full range of masses from proton to iron . for some extensive air shower ( eas )",
    "experimental techniques the uncertainty of the primary composition might translate into an additional error of the reconstructed all - nuclei spectrum , and this latter systematic uncertainty may dominate the total error of the spectrum measurement .",
    "the experimental situation clearly calls for development of new eas observation and data analysis methods . in the present paper",
    "we describe one such method based on reflected vavilov - cherenkov radiation ( `` cherenkov light '' ) registration .",
    "many details could be found in @xcite .",
    "the first proposal to use a compact device lifted over a snow surface to observe reflected cherenkov light of eas was made by a.e .",
    "chudakov @xcite .",
    "the first detector of such kind was developed by c. castagnoli et al . @xcite .",
    "the first balloon - borne apparatus capable of reflected cherenkov light observation was the sphere-1 detector @xcite ; it had a mosaic of only 19 pmts and could not register details of light impulse shape .",
    "the next generation , and currently the most advanced experiment with reflected cherenkov light , employed the sphere-2 detector .",
    "the sphere-2 balloon - borne detector @xcite had a mosaic of 109 pmts and 12.5 ns time sampling ( 25 ns until the 2012 experimental run ) .",
    "a general view of the sphere-2 detector together with the bapa tethered balloon is shown in fig .",
    "observations were typically carried out in february - march at altitude h= 400900 m above the surface of lake baikal .",
    "total observation time for the 20082013 runs was about 140 h ; about 1100 eas were detected .",
    "the detector response simulations were carried out by means of monte carlo ( mc ) approach using the corsika code with the qgsjet - i high energy hadronic model and the gheisha low energy hadronic model @xcite , and the geant4 code @xcite . the first step of experimental data analysis is reconstruction of lateral distribution function ( ldf ) of detected showers .",
    "an example of reconstructed ldf is shown in fig .",
    "ldf reconstruction is a quite complex procedure ; it is important to have several independent techniques to ensure robustness of this procedure .",
    "an example of ldf obtained with the second technique is shown in fig .",
    "2 , right .",
    "the next step of analysis , estimation of eas primary energy , was performed by normalising the experimental ldfs to the model ldfs with known energy @xcite . finally , the sample of the estimated primary energy values together with the model of the instrumental acceptance allowed the all - nuclei spectrum reconstruction @xcite,@xcite .",
    "simulated energy distributions for the 2013 experimental run data , power - law primary spectrum @xmath4 with slope @xmath5 , and different types of primary nuclei , are shown in fig .",
    "the lowest curve corresponds to the primary iron case , upper concentric curves are calculated for the nitrogen , helium and proton cases , correspondingly . the thick curve that fits the experimental histogram ( circles )",
    "is drawn for the energy distribution with mixed composition .",
    "information about the ldf steepness , that is sensitive to the primary composition , was utilized to build a model of energy distribution for mixed composition ( see @xcite,@xcite for more details ) .    the combined all - nuclei spectrum for the 20112013 runs is shown in fig.3 ( right ) by stars with statistical uncertainies ( bars ) ;",
    "systematic uncertainties are shown as well .",
    "for comparison the results of the kascade - grande ( triangles with associated statistical and systematic uncertainties ) @xcite and the akeno ( circles ) @xcite experiments are shown .",
    "for the akeno case statistical uncertainties are small and comparable to the diameter of the circles , and systematic uncertainties are unknown . for other results on the all - nuclei spectrum",
    "see @xcite .    the primary composition for the 2012 run",
    "was reconstructed using the ldf steepness parameter @xcite,@xcite , that allows an event - by - event composition study .",
    "the reconstructed composition for the 2012 run is shown in fig . 2 of @xcite .",
    "it is in general agreement with the kascade - grande result @xcite ; the estimated fraction of light nuclei averaged over the 30150 pev energy region is 0.21@xmath60.11 .",
    "uncertainty of results on the primary spectrum and composition discussed in sec .",
    "3 at e@xmath050 pev is dominated by statistical errors .",
    "two possible extensions of the sphere experiment to the energy region e@xmath0100 pev were proposed @xcite : + 1 ) a sphere - type detector with n@xmath010@xmath7 channels that would allow to perform an event - by - event study of the primary cr composition at e@xmath0100 pev with statistical uncertainty comparable to the kascade - grande s one given @xmath8500 h of exposition at h= 23 km ; + 2 ) a detector with n@xmath010@xmath7 channels aimed for study of the all - nuclei spectrum of ultrahigh energy cosmic rays ( uhecr , e@xmath010@xmath9 ev ) during a long - duration high - altitude ( h@xmath103040 km ) antarctic flight , or , alternatively , a detector with n@xmath010@xmath11 channels that would allow to study the uhecr primary composition under similar experimental conditions .         to conclude , we have reviewed a novel technique to study cr at e@xmath01 pev using reflected cherenkov light .",
    "the method is currently mature enough to be competitive with other eas observation methods , given sufficient observation time .",
    "for the first time , a detailed reconstruction of the all - particle cr spectrum at e= 3 - 300 pev was performed using reflected cherenkov light .",
    "this technique allows the cr nuclear composition study on event - by - event basis .",
    "reflected cherenkov light is a promising signal to study cr at e@xmath0100 pev , either with tethered balloon at h= 23 km , or during a high - altitude antarctic flight .",
