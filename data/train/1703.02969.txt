    "over the past decade , there has been a surge in the number of galaxies at the peak epoch of star formation ( @xmath31 ) in which molecular gas , the fuel for star formation , has been detected ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "this includes a sizable sample of `` normal '' star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ; @xcite ) ; most of these fall on a tight relation between stellar mass ( @xmath32 ) and star formation rate ( sfr @xmath33 ) , the so - called star - forming `` main - sequence '' ( ms ; @xcite ) . the specific star formation rate ( ssfr @xmath34 sfr@xmath35 ) remains roughly constant along the ms at each epoch but increases with redshift , consistent with the overall increase in the cosmic star formation rate density ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of the galaxy ms shows that the bulk of cosmic star formation at high-@xmath29 proceeds in a quasi - steady state , over long timescales ( @xmath36 gyr ) and large spatial scales , while episodes of intense merger - induced starburst activity play a smaller role .",
    "consequently , two main modes of star formation have been proposed for the high-@xmath29 sfg population : a quiescent star formation mode which dominates in ms galaxies , and an enhanced `` starburst '' mode of merger - driven star formation commonly seen in outliers lying above the ms @xcite .",
    "ms galaxies at @xmath37 have star formation rates that are @xmath38 times higher than sfrs observed in normal galaxies in the local universe .",
    "a significant fraction of extreme high-@xmath29 galaxies such as sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs ) or merging ulirgs are inconsistent with the ms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) , and display enhanced star formation efficiencies ( sfe@xmath39 = sfr/@xmath40 ) and short gas depletion timescales ( @xmath41 = 1/sfe@xmath39 ) . however , it is yet unclear what fraction of the enhanced star formation rate in high-@xmath29 sfgs is driven by their high gas masses , as opposed to an increase in their sfe , and whether this fraction differs between sfgs lying or above the galaxy ms @xcite . while recent studies for above - ms galaxies at @xmath42 have found a higher @xmath28/@xmath21@xmath30 i.e. a higher sfe relative to ms galaxies , in 7 outliers above the ms @xcite , existing work is far from conclusive .",
    "alternative theories suggest a single unified mode of intense star formation in all high-@xmath29 sfgs , driven by compression and turbulence in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , with constant replenishment of cold gas from the cosmic web @xcite . in this framework ,",
    "all high-@xmath29 sfgs , including both ms and above - ms galaxies , have a near - constant gas depletion timescale ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "such a mode would be fundamentally different from that seen in ir - luminous starburst galaxies , which boast concentrated and short - lived star formation activity , or that in local spiral galaxies , where star formation primarily takes place in clumps of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) , distributed throughout the diffuse molecular gas . as the molecular gas",
    "is strongly coupled to the star formation , we need to better characterize its properties in galaxies lying on and above the ms to identify the prevalent mode of star formation in high-@xmath29 sfgs .",
    "the kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) relation @xcite relates the local average gas density to the local sfr , typically traced using the fir luminosity @xmath28 .",
    "it also explains the observed correlation @xmath28@xmath43 @xmath21@xmath44 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where co is typically used to trace molecular gas .",
    "however , ground - state co transitions ( @xmath45 @xmath46 ) trace both the dense and diffuse molecular gas due to their low critical density , while only the cold , dense component is immediately available for star formation .",
    "most of the star formation in the milky way and the local universe takes place in the dense cores of gmcs ( @xmath47 @xmath48 ) , which are better traced by dense gas tracers such as hcn , hco@xmath10 and hnc ( @xmath49 @xmath48 ) than co. there exists a strong linear correlation between @xmath28@xmath30 and @xmath20@xmath30 @xcite .",
    "this @xmath28-@xmath20@xmath30 relation holds over 7 orders of magnitude , ranging from gmcs in the milky way to high-@xmath29 galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is a much tighter relation than the @xmath28-@xmath21@xmath30 relation , which also shows a change in slope depending on the sample selection @xcite .",
    "while such a relationship is shown by both hcn and hco@xmath10 @xcite , hco@xmath10 is more sensitive to ionization conditions and typically shows weaker emission than hcn .",
    "on the other hand , the hcn abundance can be enhanced by the presence of an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) or mechanically driven shocks or outflows , contributing to non - linearity in the @xmath20-@xmath28@xmath30 relation for more fir luminous sources @xcite .",
    "together , the relative intensities of dense gas tracers , hcn , hnc and hco@xmath10(@xmath11)@xmath30 allow us to probe the gas temperature and ionization @xcite .",
    "in addition , the line luminosity ratio @xmath20/@xmath21@xmath30 is an indicator of the dense gas fraction @xmath50 , and represents the _ actively star - forming _ fraction of molecular gas .",
    "as @xmath20/@xmath21 , @xmath28/@xmath20 , and @xmath28/@xmath21@xmath30 vary significantly between different star formation environments , these are critical tools for identifying the dominant mode of star formation in high-@xmath29 sfgs , and they provide significantly more powerful constraints on the global star formation mechanisms than @xmath28/@xmath21@xmath30 alone .",
    "however , studies of the dense molecular gas as traced by hcn require high observing sensitivity , and thus have been mostly limited to the nearby universe . there are only 3 solid and 3 tentative detections at high-@xmath29 , including lensed systems , ( u)lirgs and smgs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) ; there are no such observations for normal , unlensed sfgs at high-@xmath29 .    in this paper , we present for the first time observations of the dense , actively star - forming gas in a massive star - forming galaxy , egs 13004291 , at high redshift ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "egs 13004291 is the most co - luminous source in the currently known sample of high-@xmath29 sfgs @xcite , and is therefore the best candidate for this initial study of the dense gas fraction in high-@xmath29 sfgs .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in and , we present the observations and results . in , we discuss our analysis , including line stacking and spectral energy distribution ( sed ) fitting , as well as the serendipitous detection of two sources . in and , we discuss our results and conclusions .",
