    "solar magnetic cycle is believed to be excited by solar dynamo mechanism based on a joint action of differential rotation and mirror - asymmetric convection .",
    "differential rotation known from helioseismology produces toroidal large - scale magnetic field from poloidal one while mirror asymmetric convection is responsible for transformation of the * toroidal * large - scale magnetic field into * poloidal * one in order to close the chain of self - excitation .",
    "simple symmetry arguments show that a link between the toroidal and poloidal magnetic fields must be governed by a mirror - asymmetric * quantity ( generally a pseudo tensor ) * , however , there are several ways on how to implement this link in particulars ( e.g. by notion of cyclonic motions , @xcite ; or by magnetic tubes arising and being twisted by coriolis force , as in @xcite , @xcite mechanism , what gives a variety of solar dynamo models . from the other hand , the degree of mirror asymmetry is believed to be moderate and the very degree of mirror asymmetry seems to be hardly determined from observational data .",
    "the point is that in order to quantify the mirror asymmetry of a dynamo one has to know 3d distribution of the mean - field characteristics and compute their spatial derivatives .",
    "for example , a more straightforward quantity known as hydrodynamic ( or kinetic ) helicity density @xmath2 which determines the excess of right - hand helixes against left - hand ones requires 3d distribution of velocity field @xmath3 and its derivatives while conventional doppler - effect gives line - of - sight velocities only . note that we are interested in averaging quantities and @xmath4 means corresponding averaging .",
    "while in mean - field dynamo theory the averaging is carried out over the ensembles of turbulent pulsations , practically given the observational data in vector magnetograms of solar active regions , we average by area in the available field - of - view of something similar to that .    a practically accessible way to quantify mirror asymmetry observationally was firstly suggested by @xcite .",
    "he pointed out that vector magnetographic observations provide three magnetic field components on a surface @xmath5 at solar atmosphere ( local coordinates @xmath6 and @xmath7 are parallel to the solar surface , and for a limited field of view we can ignore the effect of curvature ) .",
    "he used the force - free field parameter @xmath8 as a proxy of electric current helicity .",
    "the available vector magnetic field is not sufficient to calculate the entire current helicity density @xmath9 and to quantify relative number of right handed twisted magnetic tubes against left - handed ones , however , one can calculate a mirror - asymmetric quantity    @xmath10    which makes one of the three believed to be similar contributions to the entire quantity @xmath11 , i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( they can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ see ] ) by circular replacement of indices ) .",
    "note that @xmath14 do not contain derivative in direction @xmath15 .",
    "if magnetic field @xmath16 is locally statistically isotropic , all three contribution in @xmath11 are statistically equal and the natural consequence is @xmath17    the force - free field parameter @xmath8 and the current helicity parameter @xmath11 become available for observational determination in solar active regions ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the above statistical studies show that the sign of @xmath8 and @xmath11 is same , which is predominantly negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern hemisphere . results of monitoring @xmath14 in two last solar cycles and butterfly diagrams for solar cyclic variation of this quantity are presented in @xcite .",
    "the quantity followed the helicity polarity rule as well as pronounced areas on the butterfly diagrams where the polarity rule is inverted @xcite .",
    "the result looks instructive for solar dynamo modeling @xcite .",
    "dynamo interpretation of the observational data is usually based on assumption of the local statistical isotropy , and so @xmath14 is considered as an observational tracer for @xmath11 .    conventional theory of turbulence is originated from @xcite , while @xcite and @xcite ideas presumes that the velocity and magnetic fields become statistically homogeneous in sufficiently small scales ( though @xcite have stressed the role of magnetic field anisotropy in mhd turbulence ) .",
    "it is however not clear what scales in the solar photospheres can be considered as homogeneous enough for this assumption and whether typical active regions may fall under this consideration .",
    "a perspective to verify to what extent the solar magnetic field at the scale of active regions can be considered as statistically isotropic has not been yet considered observationally at least in the approach suggested by @xcite : the point is that calculation of other contributions to the current helicity to be compared with @xmath14 would require derivatives of magnetic field components in @xmath15 direction while in fact we have three components of the magnetic field at surface @xmath5 only .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that one can refurnish the approach of @xcite in a way to verify the hypothesis of local isotropy in the scales of active regions . instead of to present @xmath11 as a sum of three contributions @xmath14 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 which have to be equal in a locally isotropic case , we present this quantity as a sum of six quantities to be equal in the isotropic case .",
    "four out of the six quantities do not contain derivatives in @xmath15 direction and are potentially accessible for observations .",
    "we demonstrate that the available bulk of data for the magnetic field vector in solar active regions enable us to obtain statistically robust estimates for the four quantities .",
    "local statistical isotropy implies two pairs of identities for the above four quantities .",
    "we show that one pair of the identities holds while the other fails being confronted with the observational data .",
    "we may believe that the magnetic field occurs to be substantially statistically anisotropic in scales of active regions . as a result",
    ", the quantity @xmath14 which has been traced for last two solar cycles has to be considered as a specific mirror asymmetric tracer of anisotropic solar mhd rather than purely @xmath18 .",
    "we discuss the importance of this conclusion for solar dynamo models .",
    "we used 6629 vector magnetograms observed by solar magnetic field telescope ( smft ) at huairou solar observing station from 1988 to 2005 .",
    "this data sample was used earlier by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the smft is equipped with a birefringent filter for wavelength selection and kd*p crystals to modulate polarization signals .",
    "the fe 1 5324.19   line is used .",
    "a vector magnetogram is built using four narrow - band ( 0.125 ) filtergrams of stokes _",
    "i , q , u _ and _ v _ parameters .",
    "the center wavelength of the filter can be shifted and is normally at -0.075   for the measurements of longitudinal magnetic field and at the line center for the transversal magnetic fields @xcite . the @xmath19 ambiguity in the azimuth angle ( @xmath20 )",
    "was resolved following @xcite by comparison with a potential field .",
    "we used the method given by @xcite to correct the faraday rotation to the azimuthal angles for vector magnetic field .",
    "we have also established the levels of noise for the longitudinal and transverse components of the magnetic field as 20 g and 100 g , in accord with previous works on analysis of huairou smft data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . that values have been used to estimate the impact of noise in statistical studies as it has been performed earlier by e.g. @xcite or @xcite",
    ".,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    by definition the current helicity is a scalar product of the magnetic field pseudo - vector and its curl ( proportional to the electric current ) vector . generally speaking this construction",
    "can be obtained as a trace of a more generic three - index tensor quantity as it has been considered by @xcite , see their appendix 1 . for our analysis ,",
    "let us denote local observable quantities by low cases , i.e. the local magnetic field @xmath21 which is observable at the solar surface @xmath22 as well as the local electric current helicity density @xmath23 .",
    "we denote @xmath24 local cartesian coordinates on the image plane . the direction to the observer @xmath15 on the plane",
    "is fixed @xmath22 .",
    "we reserve above mentioned notations @xmath16 and @xmath11 for the magnetic field and current helicity in homogeneous and isotropic model . then according to definition of @xmath25 this quantity naturally comprises of six parts : @xmath26 where    @xmath27    we denote integral quantities over the available magnetogram field - of - view by capital cases @xmath28 for @xmath29 , so the overall average current helicity reads @xmath30    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in order to establish the degree of anisotropy quantitatively , we take 3 active regions which used for calculating boundary integral in section 3 for examples .",
    "we estimate the relative degree of anisotropy , for example , as a relative anisotropy imbalance between the two parts of helicity using some norm as following :    @xmath31    where the norm @xmath32 can be computed as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is weight factor as follow : when we integrate in the magnetogram using all pixels , then @xmath35 .",
    "alternatively , we can use only pixels where the signal is greater than cut - off noise levels ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) as we usually do so in helicity statistical studies ( @xmath35 if greater , or @xmath38 if less than noise level ) .",
    "the value of @xmath39 is between 0 to 1 .",
    "the results are listed in table  [ tab : xu2 ] .",
    "@xmath39 is calculated using all pixels in the magnetogram , @xmath40 is only using the pixels where the signal is greater than cut - off noise levels . from this table , the order of @xmath39 is from 0.74 to 0.83 and it is not affected much by the noise , which is close to 1 , it says that the observed quantities are extremely anisotropic .",
    "we may further speculate about the sources of anisotropy of current helicity .",
    "one effect which sounds trivial in the solar photosphere would be vertical stratification of convection .",
    "we , however , are inclined to discuss this issue as the parts of helicity involving vertical derivatives of the magnetic field are not observationally available .",
    "the difference in properties and behaviour of @xmath41 and @xmath42 is likely a manifestation of the effect of rotation as one contains derivatives with respect to azimuthal ( collinear to rotation ) , and the other meridional direction ( perpendicular to rotation ) .",
    "the other source of anisotropy could be the effect of large - scale magnetic field .",
    "two components ( azimuthal and radial ) of the solar cyclic magnetic field are anti - symmetric over the equator and the other meridional component is symmetric over the solar equator .",
    "the complete use of the assumption of local statistical isotropy means also the equality between these two groups of the three parts of helicity in equation  [ h146 ] and  [ h235 ] .",
    "two of them , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , however , can not be calculated from the observational vector magnetograph data at the solar photosphere .",
    "therefore , we can not check the condition of local isotropy of solar turbulence in active region by observationally available data completely . on the other hand ,",
    "there are several factors which affect the precision of the calculated helicity parts , such as that the accuracy of transversal field is lower than the one of longitudinal field , the magneto - optical effects , calibration of magnetic fields etc .",
    "we can not completely estimate the influence of these factors on the helicity parts although we used some data reduction method to reduce it .",
    "this topic requires further investigation .",
    "we have studied the distribution and properties of the parts of current helicity from observation and simulation .",
    "the main conclusions are as following :    \\(1 ) the simulation results show that the means of the six helicity parts statistically coincide with each other for the isotropic case , while for the anisotropic helical case it is different .",
    "\\(2 ) the distribution of the observed helicity parts is similar with the helical anisotropic case in simulations .",
    "this shows that the distribution of the observed helicity parts is anisotropic over active region scales .",
    "assumptions of local homogeneity and isotropy in computation of observational proxies of helicity require further analysis in the light of our findings .",
    "\\(3 ) the four observable helicity parts are equal in pairs owing to the magnetic field is weak at the boundaries of magnetogram , but there is a large difference between different pairs which may be caused by the anisotropy of the current helicity density in active region .",
    "both the pairs of the helicity parts follow the hemispheric sign rule with certain exceptions in periods and hemispheres but the sums of the two parts follow the hemispheric sign rule more robust and uniform than the individual parts of helicity alone .",
    "more theoretical modeling of anisotropy in solar - like turbulence is required to understand these statistical results .",
    "our simple simulations have shown that the anisotropy may be present in several directions and not only in the direction of vertical stratification .",
    "this is confirmed by several examples of observational data as well as their statistical analysis .",
    "other sources of anisotropy such as inhomogeneity or rotation , and furthermore presence of the large - scale _ mean _ magnetic field which alternates in sign with every 11-year sunspot cycle may be possible explanations of these results .",
