    "molecular clouds contain many organic molecules that are known to be important in biochemistry .",
    "astronomical observations , particularly at radio wavelengths , allow us to determine the chemical composition and characteristics of this molecular inventory ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "following incorporation into protostellar disks and comets , these molecules , or their descendants , were probably the major source of volatile organic material available to the early earth @xcite .",
    "studies of molecular cloud composition therefore enable us to quantitatively address the issue of the connection between interstellar chemistry , the organic composition of primitive solar system material , and the origin , evolution and distribution of life in the galaxy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "many organics that are known , or strongly suspected , to be present in interstellar clouds , are fundamental components of the large organic macromolecules that are central to biochemistry .",
    "examples of these are sugars and amino acids , the respective building blocks of polysaccharides and proteins .",
    "the simplest of these , glycolaldehyde and glycine , are both identified in the interstellar medium @xcite .    until recently ,",
    "definitive detections of interstellar ring compounds have been scarce ( e.g.  ethylene oxide , @xcite ) and previous searches for imidazole , cyanoform , pyrrole and pyrimidine were unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "recently we have tentatively detected the azaheterocyclic compounds 2h - azirine ( @xmath4-@xmath5 ) and aziridine ( @xmath4-@xmath6 ) at mm wavelengths @xcite .",
    "two ( different ) tentative lines of aziridine have also been claimed by @xcite .",
    "these observations suggest that biochemically important ring molecules may await detection . of these potential discoveries , a key interstellar molecule for astrobiology , comparable in importance to glycine , would be pyrimidine ( @xmath4-@xmath7 ) , the unsubstituted ring analogue for three of the dna and rna bases : thymine , cytosine and uracil .",
    "interstellar pyrimidine was unsuccessfully searched for at 46 ghz 30 years ago @xcite .",
    "evidence for various purines and pyrimidines in space , including pyrimidine , comes from the fact that they have been detected in meteoritic organic matter @xcite , and also may be components of comet halley s chon dust @xcite .    the molecular composition of hot molecular cores is known to largely reflect the solid state chemistry that occurred on grain surfaces , prior to their deposition into the gas after protostellar dust heating ( see @xcite ) .",
    "reactions between hcn and vycn ( @xmath8 ) on the surface of dust grains has been suggested as a possible source of interstellar pyrimidine @xcite .",
    "observations of hot cores , known to contain other rings believed to have formed on dust prior to evaporation , such as @xmath4-@xmath9 ( ethylene oxide ) @xcite and @xmath4-@xmath5 @xcite , do show the very high abundances of the hcn and vycn molecules required for formation of n - heterocycles @xcite .",
    "alternatively , experiments indicate that energetic processing of ices ( e.g.  @xcite ) leads to an organic residue containing many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) @xcite .",
    "one may speculate that similar processing of interstellar ice analogues containing ammonia , molecular nitrogen , and hydrogen cyanide , may similarly produce n - heterocycles like pyrimidine .",
    "hence , searches of hot molecular cores , employing high - quality spectroscopic data , may offer the best chance of a pyrimidine detection .",
    "in this paper we report the results of a search towards three massive star - forming regions for submillimeter emission from pyrimidine .",
    "we carried out a program of submillimeter observations using the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) on mauna kea , hawaii during semester 01b over the period september 913 , 2001 .",
    "additional measurements were made on november 23 , december 12 , and december 10 , 2001 .",
    "our target list is given in table  [ tbl-1 ] ; column 4 gives the nominal lsr velocity of each source adopted for the search .",
    "the source list consists of three well - studied regions of massive star formation which are known to be rich in complex organic molecules ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    ".source list [ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     sample pyrimidine spectra are shown in figures  [ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] . with a limited number of spectral lines observed in each source , our submillimeter - wave search for pyrimidine did not yield a definite detection of pyrimidine in either",
    "sgr b2(n ) or orion kl . by averaging over all observed lines measurable in each source ( see table  [ tbl-3 ] ) ,",
    "the inferred upper limits on the total column density in sgr b2 and orion are 1.7@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath12 and 2.4@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath12 , respectively .    in the case of w51  e1/e2",
    ", there is a spectral feature at @xmath13 57 km s@xmath14 with respect to the rest frequency adopted for the observation ( see the spectrum shown in the lower panel of figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this feature coincides precisely with the j @xmath15 55 band - head of pyrimidine between 342289.9 and 342297.4 mhz ( line 4 ) , containing 32 transitions at v@xmath16 = 59.0 km s@xmath14 . an unidentified u - line at 342290.0 mhz",
    "was previously reported in a line survey of orion kl @xcite ; unfortunately we did not observe either orion or sgr  b2 at this particular frequency .",
    "the total pyrimidine column density in w51 e1/e2 derived solely from line 4 is 4.8@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath12 ; the averaged upper limit to the column density from all 3 lines available in w51 is n@xmath17 @xmath18 3.4@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the pyrimidine column density computed only from line 4 ( assuming t@xmath19 = 100 k ) is just slightly higher ( within a factor of 2 ) than the upper limits deduced from the two other , interloper - contaminated , lines .",
    "it appears that if line 4 of w51 is truly a detection , we may have expected to detect another bandhead , line 5 , whose transitions are at higher frequencies .",
    "it could be argued that the fact that we failed to detect line 5 makes the identification of line 4 less likely .",
    "however , line 5 is expected to be much weaker than line 4 at an excitation temperature lower than 100 k , and so , in the absence of accurately measured pyrimidine rotational temperatures for these sources , we can not entirely rule out a true detection in w51 .",
    "finally , the submillimeter transitions targeted in this search possess rather high excitation levels , and so any observable pyrimidine emission would mostly originate from regions of high temperature and/or density , if radiative excitation is negligible . as a result , these excited pyrimidine molecules would have been located in regions fairly close to protostellar hot cores within molecular clouds .",
    "it is therefore probable that the real source size is smaller than the telescope beam ( @xmath1314 ) ; it is more likely to be the case particularly for distant sources such as sgr b2(n ) and w51 e1/e2 .",
    "hence , one should note that our observations would suffer from beam dilution if the source extent is indeed smaller than the beam .",
    "the derived upper limits on the column densities , based on the assumption that the source fills the beam , could consequently be underestimated .",
    "the upper limits of fractional abundance of pyrimidine with respect to molecular hydrogen , x(@xmath20 ) = n@xmath21 , may also be deduced .",
    "molecular hydrogen column densities inferred from single - dish observations with beam sizes similar to the jcmt are employed , in order to determine the beam - averaged abundances more accurately .",
    "the h@xmath22 column densities adopted are : @xmath23 5 @xmath10 10@xmath24 @xmath12  for sgr b2(n ) @xcite , 8 @xmath10 10@xmath25 @xmath12  for orion kl @xcite , and 1 @xmath10 10@xmath24 @xmath12  for w51 e1/e2 @xcite .",
    "the upper limits of pyrimidine fractional abundances thus estimated are x(@xmath20 ) @xmath18 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath26 for sgr b2 , 3.0 @xmath10 10@xmath27 for orion , and 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath27 for w51 .",
    "our submillimeter search for the nucleic acid building - block pyrimidine has not been successful .",
    "we have perhaps detected one-_line _ in a single source but this needs to be confirmed .",
    "the negative result therefore can not be considered definitive and searches at lower frequencies may yet detect pyrimidine in hot cores .",
    "the low inferred pyrimidine abundance limits may simply reflect the fact that pyrimidine is generally of low abundance in massive star - forming cores , and hence it is difficult to populate the high - j energy levels ( j @xmath18 56 in our study ) which are observable at submillimeter wavelengths . on the other hand",
    ", it could also imply that either pyrimidine is not evaporated efficiently from dust grains at hot core temperatures , or is destroyed easily in the warmest regions in hot cores sampled by submillimeter observations .",
    "it would appear that the best chance for an astronomical detection of pyrimidine , and other nitrogen heterocycles , is probably in the circumstellar envelopes ( cses ) of carbon stars .",
    "agb and post - agb stars ( e.g. irc+10216 , crl 618 and crl 2688 ) are copious producers of carbonaceous dust particles .",
    "recent iso observations of well - known protoplanetary nebulae ( ppne ) have uncovered more new organic molecules , including the first detection of benzene in crl 618 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the initial stages of dust formation involve polymerization of acetylene to form benzene and subsequent @xmath28 additions lead to large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) molecules ( e.g.  @xcite ) . during this reaction sequence other triply - bonded molecules",
    "can also add to the growing ring structures .",
    "in particular , recent theoretical work indicates that n atoms can become incorporated in ring structures through additions involving hcn @xcite .",
    "however , the kinetics of ring growth suggests that single rings containing two n atoms will be less favoured than single rings with one n atom ( i.e. pyridine ) .",
    "even two - ring compounds containing a single n atom , such as quinoline and isoquinoline , the n - substituted analogues of naphthalene , could be more abundant than pyrimidine @xcite and may explain why our search appears to have been unsuccessful .",
    "searches for pyridine , quinoline and isoquinoline in the molecular envelopes of evolved stars are currently underway .    as an alternative to ring formation in neutral - neutral reactions ,",
    "@xcite have shown that ion - molecule reactions are able to account for the abundance of benzene observed in crl 618 .",
    "the growth of larger rings , and incorporation of heteroatoms into them , has not yet been considered in circumstellar ion - molecule chemistry .",
    "@xcite have proposed one neutral process , involving benzene and cn , that could lead to nitrogen being added to ring structures . however , the product of this reaction has the nitrogen present in a side - group ( i.e. benzonitrile , @xmath4-@xmath29 ) and not bonded into the ring .",
    "another possible reason for a low interstellar pyrimidine abundance concerns its photostability .",
    "the infrared spectra and photostability of pyrimidine have recently been measured in an ar matrix at 10 k @xcite .",
    "the stability of pyrimidine ( which does not have real aromatic properties ) against uv photolysis is rather limited and far below that of mono and polycyclic aromatic rings .",
    "these experiments appear to indicate that any circumstellar pyrimidine would be easily destroyed by uv photons , or cosmic ray particles , soon after delivery to the interstellar medium . in this case ,",
    "any interstellar pyrimidine would have to be produced in dark molecular clouds .",
    "to strengthen the role of prebiotic interstellar matter in astrobiology , we have searched for 6 pyrimidine lines in three massive star - forming regions : sgr b2(n ) , orion kl and w51 e1/e2 .",
    "our search was unsuccessful and did not yield a conclusive result , with only one potential single-_line _ detection .",
    "the abundance limits inferred are @xmath18 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath26 for sgr b2 , 3.0 @xmath10 10@xmath27 for orion , and 3.4 @xmath10 10@xmath27 for w51 .",
    "our negative result may simply reflect the fact that interstellar pyrimidine is of low abundance .",
    "sources that are ongoing sites of carbon dust formation , such as the c - rich envelopes of agb and post - agb stars , probably present the best opportunity for detecting pyrimidine and other nitrogen heterocycles .",
