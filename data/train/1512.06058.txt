    "in plasma physics , turbulence is an underlying problem for numerous topics of research , ranging from the study of anomalous transport across magnetic surfaces in fusion relevant plasmas to the problem of plasma heating in astrophysical conditions .",
    "one of the most identifiable characteristics of turbulence is the self - organization of turbulent structures .",
    "mathematically , following a fourier decomposition , the nonlinear interactions between various scales of the system can be discerned ( here length scales being defined simply as @xmath0 ) and the self - organization of turbulence can be described in term of energy transfers and scale fluxes@xcite . while this methodology is primarily used in the case of homogenous isotropic turbulence , large scale motions like the zonal flows are captured by particular modes of the system . as these modes can lead to the development of an anisotropy that can affect the energy transfers and the scale fluxes ,",
    "expanding the definitions of various nonlinear based diagnostics becomes necessary for a better understanding of the underlying dynamics of the turbulent system and the subsequent development of models .",
    "micro - turbulence in gradient driven magnetized plasmas represents one of the best examples where large structures in turbulence self - organize to give rise to zonal flows@xcite that in turn dominate the self - organization of smaller scales . since the turbulent structures in plasma reach scales much smaller than that of the ion gyroradius in the presence of a strong magnetic guide field , using the five - dimensional gyrokinetic ( gk ) formalism ( for which , due to the gyrokinetic ordering , the gyration phase of charged particles around the magnetic guide field has been removed consistently@xcite ) represents the most efficient method for the description of the problem@xcite .",
    "this approach@xcite is of particular interest in sheared toroidal magnetic geometries characteristic of tokamaks .",
    "as turbulent structures tend to elongate along magnetic field lines , the natural coordinate system for the problem , namely field - aligned coordinates@xcite @xmath1 , becomes nonorthogonal .",
    "any modal decomposition along nonorthogonal directions show complicated couplings of primary instabilities ( responsible for the source of free energy ; the quantity of interest for the nonlinear redistribution@xcite in gk turbulence ) and secondary instabilities ( responsible for the self - organization of structures ) . to simplify the analysis of the interplay between primary and zonal - flow modes and the subsequent impact on the turbulent energy redistribution",
    ", we turn towards a simpler yet non - trivial problem , that of the z - pinch@xcite .    in a z - pinch configuration ,",
    "described using a simple cylindrical coordinate system ( @xmath2 ) , a cylindrically symmetric equilibrium magnetic guide field is given as , @xmath3 .",
    "unlike the complicated tokamak geometry ( even local equilibrium models@xcite have a non - diagonal metric tensor ) , for such a simple closed field line system a fourier mode can only contribute energy to one scale , drastically simplifying the energy redistribution analysis .",
    "the primary instability driving gk turbulence in this system is the small scale entropy - mode@xcite .",
    "it manifests itself by the development of streamer like structures in the radial direction .",
    "as secondary instabilities are excited , zonal flows develop in the @xmath4-direction .",
    "depending on the parameters of the system , zonal flows will dominate the self - organization of turbulence@xcite , leading to a predator - prey type oscillation@xcite between streamer and zonal flows like structures .",
    "form this interplay , coherent vortices can emerge , as seen in other plasma configurations@xcite .    while the study of z - pinch plasmas represents an area of interest on its own , we limit our analysis to the impact made by zonal flow structures on the redistribution of energy between scales and the subsequent wavenumber anisotropy developed .",
    "as such , we introduce a series of nonlinear diagnostics that can describe the wavenumber anisotropy from the perspective of free energy fluxes .",
    "this represents the focus of the current work , for which the z - pinch configuration is used as a simple framework for these ideas to be put forward . in the final section",
    ", we will discuss an extension of these diagnostics and their applicability to tokamak geometries .",
    "numerically , we make use of the eulerian code gene@xcite , which can solve the nonlinear gyrokinetic equations in both global@xcite and local@xcite ( flux - tube ) geometries . here , the standard field - aligned coordinates @xmath1 are employed for a local flux - surface approximation of the z - pinch geometry ( @xmath2 ) . in this approximation , a small periodic domain , mapped by the radial coordinate @xmath5 ,",

    "as it is mentioned in ref  [ ] , the collisional and hyperdiffusion terms can affect the growth rate of the modes .",
    "however , since this work concentrates on the study of the anisotropic redistribution of free energy , a high @xmath61 energy accumulation is deemed more problematic than a shift in growth rates .    as numerically @xmath62",
    "is taken to be zero , the pressure gradient is neglected and the ideal mhd interchange mode does not enter into our system .",

    "the analysis of the nonlinear energy redistribution between perpendicular spatial scales , presented here , is based solely on the computation of @xmath66 , defined as @xmath67 from the perspective of the underlying triadic interactions , @xmath66 can be interpreted as the energy received by a mode @xmath68 from the interaction with all other modes .",
    "seeing @xmath66 as the total energy received rather than the total energy given is just an arbitrary choice that does not change the results as long as this interpretation is used consistently ; here a mode receives energy if @xmath69 and gives energy if @xmath70 .",
    "unlike previous works@xcite , which use a shell decomposition for the nonlinear energy transfers that requires multiple computations of the nonlinear terms ( of the order of the number of shells , or even its square ) , an analysis based solely on @xmath71 terms requires only one computation of the nonlinear term . while using this approach prohibits the computation of shell - to - shell energy transfers@xcite or obtaining information related to the locality of interactions@xcite , it is still possible to obtain data related to the transfer spectra and the energy fluxes , as we will see next .",

    "the free energy is independently conserved by the @xmath51 nonlinear term for each species .",
    "however , it would be improper to think of the nonlinear interactions that contribute to these two individual energy channels as being separate . as the gyro - averaged electrostatic potential enters the nonlinearities from the @xmath51 drift velocity , it acts as a mediator for the energy exchanges .",
    "seeing the electrostatic potential as the sum of moments of the distribution functions , leads to the interpretation that each species mediates the energy exchanges of all other species , or equivalently that each energy transfer for a species is mediated by all the other species .    rewriting the condition given by eq .",

    "consequently , a negative value for the flux denotes an inverse cascade of energy across scales .      in a similar fashion",

    "it should be noted that the angular flux can be defined to be positive if energy is being moved towards a given direction ( towards the @xmath25 direction for instance ) . while simpler conceptually , the definition given here leads a transfer of energy from the @xmath95-axis towards the @xmath25-axis to generate a positive flux in the @xmath96 $ ] interval and a negative value one in the @xmath97 $ ] interval .",
    "we introduce another quantity that can help characterize the anisotropic redistribution of free energy .",
    "the angular density of the free energy scale flux can be defined as , @xmath98 from the start it is evident that the scale flux is recovered by integrating over @xmath99 , @xmath100 highlighting the role of @xmath101 as an angular density of the free energy scale flux . however , while the three definitions of the scale flux given by eq .",
    "( [ def_flux ] ) are equivalent , the resulting angular densities are not .",

    "can fail to capture any modes from the rectangular grid , it is preferred to use the given definition ( computed numerically in the interval @xmath104 $ ] ) , which is not as sensitive to the angular distribution of small @xmath61 modes .",
    "while the results obtained from the definition adopted here are smoother in appearance , the visual representation of the anisotropy is the same regardless of the definition adopted .",
    "we stress that the angular density of the scale flux is still a quantity related to the transfer of energy across scales and it should not be interpreted as a measure of the movement of energy from one direction to another ( which is the angular flux given by eq .",

    "we report on the steady state regimes for the @xmath65 and @xmath105 cases ; the gradient levels for both ion and electron species are equal . in both cases ,",

    "the case @xmath105 exhibits such a behavior during its transient state , consisting of streamer like structures being broken by zonal flows only to reform again .",
    "this interplay during the transient state corresponds in fig .",

    "central to this work , for the steady state regimes , we present the free energy scale flux ( eq .  [ def2_f ] ) and its respective angular density ( eq .  [ def2_fa ] ) for each species . these quantities are presented for @xmath65 in fig .  [ fig_fluxes_16 ] and for @xmath105 in fig .",
    "[ fig_fluxes_40 ] .",
    "looking at the maximal values , the ion scale flux is about twice as large as the electron flux ( @xmath110 ) for the @xmath65 case . at large scales ( @xmath111 ) , while the ion flux is slowly growing in value ( seemingly as @xmath112 ) , the electron flux exhibits an inverse cascade process ( negative valued flux ) . at smaller scales ( @xmath113 ) , the ion scale flux becomes scale independent , a fact associated with inertial range dynamics . for the @xmath105 case ,",
    "[ fig_fluxes_40 ] , the maximal value of the ion scale flux is smaller than its electron counterpart ( @xmath114 ) . in this case",

    ", the ion scale flux seems to achieve scale independence and is positive in value , even if this value is much smaller that the maximal negative one .",
    "a more interesting behavior is exhibited by the electron scale flux , which in this case exhibits a @xmath115 scaling .",
    "this yet unexplained scaling has been observed for other systems ( astrophysical and tokamak conditions ) and merits more future work to try to explain it .",
    "while the scale flux represents a good way to determine the type of energy cascade ( direct or inverse ) and provides additional information regarding its saturation value and wavenumber dependence ( or lack thereof ) , by construction , it can not distinguish between contributions made by different directions .",
    "for both cases and both species , looking at the angular density of the scale flux we clearly see the anisotropic wavenumber makeup .    in the case of @xmath65",
    ", while negative angular sections are present for the ion flux , the electron angular density clearly shows that both negative and positive angular sections coexist .",
    "while the dominance of one aspect gives the overall direct or inverse characteristic to the scale flux , it should be clear that both energy redistribution mechanisms are present at the same time .",
    "for the electrons we see that the positive fluxes ( from large to small scales ) are in the @xmath5-direction , while the negative fluxes ( traditionally associated with the reorganization of large scales in turbulence ) are along the @xmath8-direction .",
    "this indicates the radial break up of large structures into smaller ones , while at the same time joining together to form even larger scales in the @xmath106direction ; a picture consistent with what we come to expect from turbulence in the presence of zonal flows .    for the case",
    "@xmath105 , the positive valued electron scale flux is clearly shown to be composed of negative angular sections , when looking at the angular density .",
    "moreover , we see that both species exhibit dominant positive value fluxes in the @xmath116 directions .",
    "we associate this behavior with the vortex dominated turbulent state .",
    "as vortices are structures with comparable @xmath95 and @xmath25 wavenumbers , observing preferential @xmath116 directions in the energy redistribution is not surprising .",
    "looking at the ions , we also notice that the contributions to the flux are close to zero along the @xmath25-axis , indicating the suppression of the energy cascade along this direction at larger @xmath61 .",
    "while the angular density of the scale flux allows us to measure the anisotropy of the cascade of energy between large and small scales , it does not tell us how much energy is moved from one direction to the other .",
    "this is important , as gauging the amount of energy transferred through a direction can help us understand the development of anisotropy .",
    "we present the angular flux ( @xmath117 ) for the case @xmath65 in fig .",
    "[ fig_aflux16 ] and for the case @xmath105 in fig .",
    "[ fig_aflux40 ] .",
    "normalizing the angular flux to the maximal value of the scale flux allows us to assess the strength of the angular energy redistribution .",
    "while for an ideal isotropic case we expect to see zero angular flux , oscillations around zero are to be expected in practice , especially when long time averages are not possible .    for @xmath65 , for both ion and electron angular fluxes , negative values can be see in the @xmath118 $ ] interval and positive values in the @xmath119 $ ] interval .",
    "this is a sign of energy flowing from the @xmath25-axis towards the @xmath95-axis .",
    "the @xmath120 $ ] interval just reproduces this behavior , due to the reality condition .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ion angular flux is substantially reduced in value compared to its flux across k. also , as the ion angular flux curve is more flat across each interval compared to the electrons , we can infer a more constant angular flow of energy",
    ".    for @xmath105 , looking at the angular fluxes , we see that the energy flows in opposite directions for ion and electron species .",
    "while for the ions the energy is flowing towards the @xmath95-axis , for the electrons the energy is flowing towards the @xmath25-axis .",
    "as the angular flux is integrated over all possible scales , we can not say if the energy represents an exchange between streamer and zonal - flow modes or smaller scale structures .",
    "in this paper we introduced a series of novel diagnostics related to the assessment of anisotropy of the nonlinear energy redistribution between scales for turbulent systems .",
    "results are reported for a gyrokinetic plasma in a z - pinch magnetic geometry .    from the angular density of the scale flux",
    "we see that while scale fluxes indicative of direct energy cascades are observed for gk turbulent systems , they are highly anisotropic . not only do most positive contributions come from the @xmath121 direction ( @xmath95-axis ) , or solely from the @xmath122 one , but negative values denoting an inverse exchange of energy is found along the @xmath8 direction ( @xmath123 ) .",
    "the z - pinch case reported here is a perfect example where the backscatter of energy in a direct cascade scenario is found to occupy a distinct wavenumber domain .",
    "while the direct cascade is associated with the removal of energy at small scales , the backscatter of energy is associated with the self - organization of structures in turbulence .",
    "a similar behavior is expected for the more complex sheared toroidal geometry case .",
    "looking at the angular density plots for the two cases , we can infer another interesting result . while certain wavenumber domains show the backscatter of energy , this occurs for relatively small @xmath61 . at large @xmath61 , the angular density shows positive values for all angles @xmath99 .",
    "this seems to indicate a certain universality of the small scales , which just move the free energy to ever smaller scales until they become thermalized .",
    "larger direct numerical simulations are needed to properly validate this interpretation . however ,",
    "this is consistent with what we expect form turbulence : complex self - organization of larger scales , interacting with universal small scales ; especially when zonal flows are present .",
    "relating the @xmath99 angle arc for the domain that exhibits a backscatter of energy to the parameters characterizing the zonal flows is a desired goal for the future .",
    "moreover , as the development of coherent structures ( vortices ) is related to intermittency in turbulence , we see that the angular density plots can capture these effects ( the @xmath116 enhanced contributions for the @xmath105 case ) .",
    "one particular line of work that will benefit from this analysis consists in the further development of les models for gyrokinetics .",
    "in essence , les models attempt to reproduce the correct scale flux value for a given @xmath61 , while neglecting the contributions made to this flux from interactions that involve small scales ( not present in the simulation ) .",
    "while les methods are successful in removing energy accumulation at large wavenumbers , they fail when coupled solely with the largest scales that govern the transport levels in plasma .",
    "the fact that les models depend on a constant , which even when dynamically computed is taken to be positive , can explain this failure .",
    "as les methods were primarily developed to remove energy , they are not designed to take into account inverse cascades ( negative scale fluxes ) , for which a negative value constant is presumably needed . however , as seen by looking at the angular density of the scale flux , both positive and negative angular sections coexist for the same @xmath61 .",
    "this implies that computing either a positive or negative constant for the les method will lead to one of the contributions to the flux to be faulty at very large scales .",
    "the results presented in this work suggest the need for a constant that has a @xmath99 dependence for each @xmath61 .    in general , regardless of the source of anisotropy , a similar @xmath124 object can be constructed for any quadratic nonlinearity , where the parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers are taken in reference to the anisotropic direction .",
    "thus , all diagnostics built on the net energy transfer are general and valid for various turbulent problems . moreover , as the nonlinear diagnostics presented here are much cheeper from a numerical perspective , it is the hope of the authors that they will be used on a larger scale by the plasma community , helping to accumulate information related to the nonlinear energy exchanges for a wide variety of cases .",
    "computing the energy transfers between various wavenumber shells and angular sections is technically possible ; this was done in the past for three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamic turbulence using a ring decomposition@xcite . however , in practice , the computational cost compared to the benefits of such an analysis makes this a prohibitive endeavor for gk turbulence .    in a tokamak geometry , and even for simpler flux - tube simulations , due to the metric dependence on @xmath54 , a @xmath125 object needs to form the starting point for a similar analysis , to allow for the recovery of scale fluxes .",
    "while this involves a larger memory requirement ( not a particularly stringent constraint ) , the computational costs remain the same .    finally , an interesting result that is worth mentioning is the @xmath126 slope exhibited by the electron scale flux for steady state turbulence dominated by the electron cascade ( @xmath127 ) .",
    "the same @xmath126 scaling for the electron scale flux was observed in slab simulations pertinent to astrophysical conditions , while an antenna driven ions species was found to have a scale independent flux .",
    "this puzzling and interesting behavior will be analyzed in detail elsewhere and remains an open question .",

    "<S> for a z - pinch geometry , we report on the nonlinear redistribution of free energy across scales perpendicular to the magnetic guide field , for a turbulent plasma described in the framework of gyrokinetics . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis is performed using a local flux - surface approximation , in a regime dominated by electrostatic fluctuations driven by the entropy mode , with both ion and electron species being treated kinetically . to explore the anisotropic nature of the free energy redistribution caused by the emergence of zonal flows </S>",
    "<S> , we use a polar coordinate representation for the field - perpendicular directions and define an angular density for the scale flux . </S>",
    "<S> positive values for the classically defined ( angle integrated ) scale flux , which denote a direct energy cascade , are shown to be also composed of negative angular sections , a fact that impacts our understanding of the backscatter of energy and the way in which it enters the modeling of sub - grid scales for turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> a definition for the flux of free energy across each perpendicular direction is introduced as well , which shows that the redistribution of energy in the presence of zonal flows is highly anisotropic . </S>"
