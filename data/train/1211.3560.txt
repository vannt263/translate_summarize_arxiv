    "understanding how quantum resources compare to classical ones is of fundamental importance in the rising field of quantum information science  @xcite .",
    "an insightful approach is to characterize , for instance , information processing tasks that can be achieved by distributed parties sharing different resources  @xcite .",
    "notable examples of classical resources are shared randomness and classical communication of various types ( distinguished , e.g. , by restrictions on the amount and/or direction of communication , and/or number of rounds performed  @xcite ) .",
    "quantum resources also fall under different categories , such as separable or entangled states  @xcite in particular .    a natural way to compare quantum resources against classical ones is via the simulation  @xcite of _ quantum measurement scenarios _  @xcite . there , one tries to simulate the correlations obtained by measuring a given quantum state in a bell scenario  @xcite , allowing the parties to use in the simulation shared randomness and possibly classical communication  @xcite . if no communication is allowed , the set of simulable correlations is bounded by bell inequalities  @xcite , whereas an infinite amount of communication allows the simulation of any correlations .",
    "conversely , the number of classical bits exchanged by the parties can be used to quantify the entanglement of a given state that violates some bell inequalities . for the example of the singlet state , projective measurements",
    "can be simulated with 1 bit in the _ worst case _ scenario  @xcite , and more general measurements with 6 bits _ on average _  @xcite . a more general model by massar _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite simulates arbitrary measurements on arbitrary bipartite states using a finite number of bits on average  @xcite .",
    "a few results are known for the multipartite case : for instance , projective equatorial measurements on the multipartite greenberger - horne - zeilinger state  @xcite can be simulated using shared randomness and finite communication on average  @xcite ; in the tripartite case , 3 bits are always sufficient  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , only small amounts of communication are necessary in the tasks mentioned above , which we will refer to as _ standard simulation tasks_. in fact , even the correlations obtained from entanglement swapping  @xcite(a more complex process involving both entangled states and entangled measurements ) can be simulated using only finite communication and uncorrelated shared randomness  @xcite .",
    "of course , it should not be forgotten that there exist entangled states which  when measured one copy at a time  can be simulated using solely shared randomness ( see , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) ; such states can not be distinguished from separable states in a standard simulation task .",
    "nevertheless , these states have an advantage over separable states for quantum teleportation  @xcite , and their nonlocal behavior can be demonstrated using more subtle bell tests ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "note that all these tasks involve single copies of quantum states .",
    "other scenarios allowing joint measurement on multiple copies of a quantum state  @xcite nevertheless enable states with bell - local correlations to exhibit non - local correlations .",
    "we will however not consider such possibilities in our paper , and stick to the problem of simulating correlations produced by single copies of quantum states .    in a standard bipartite bell scenario , alice and",
    "bob receive or select randomly classical inputs @xmath0 , @xmath1 indicating measurements to be performed on the shared state @xmath2 , with outcomes @xmath3 , @xmath4 . in a quantum input ( qi ) scenario , the inputs are quantum states @xmath5 , @xmath6 , prepared and provided by an external agent , to be measured jointly but locally by alice and bob with their respective part of the state @xmath2 , producing outcomes @xmath3 , @xmath4 . it is assumed that there is no leak of information about the indices @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "we then consider the task of simulating qi scenarios using classical resources , namely local operations assisted by shared randomness ( losr ) , as well as classical communication ( locc ) . ]",
    "recently , buscemi  @xcite generalized standard bell scenarios by using",
    "_ quantum _ inputs , and showed that , in those scenarios , single copies of any entangled state can produce correlations which are non - simulable using only shared randomness and local operations ( see figure  [ fig : scenarios ] ) .",
    "naturally , these scenarios call also for a generalization of the standard simulation task which we will refer to as the _ quantum input simulation task_. these simulation tasks are defined in section  [ sec : simulationtasks ] .",
    "we prove our main result in section  [ sec : nonsimulability ] , namely that in the quantum input framework , it is _ impossible _ to simulate _ any _ entangled state using shared randomness and even unrestricted classical communication  thus establishing a new feature of quantum entanglement .",
    "we demonstrate this by constructing , for any entangled state , a generalized bell scenario and an inequality that is necessarily satisfied by classical resources , but which can be violated by the given entangled state .",
    "explicit examples of such inequalities for werner states are given in section  [ sec : wernerstates ] .",
    "before proving our main result , let us generalize the standard simulation tasks to allow for quantum inputs .",
    "we shall start by recalling from ref .  @xcite the simulation task inspired from a standard bell test .",
    "[ sec : simulationtasks ]      in the bipartite case , we define via the triple @xmath7 the scenario to be simulated , where @xmath2 is a bipartite entangled state shared between alice and bob , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) elements  @xcite describing the respective measurements to be performed on their subsystems ; each povm , labeled by settings @xmath0 or @xmath1 , has outcomes @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "the simulation task is defined as follows : alice and bob are given beforehand classical descriptions of the triple specifying the scenario and have access to shared randomness . in each round of the simulation , they each receive a classical description of their input @xmath0 or @xmath1 but do not know the other party s input .",
    "their task is to produce  possibly after some rounds of classical communication with each other  classical outputs @xmath10 such that they reproduce exactly the joint conditional probability distribution    @xmath11,\\ ] ]    as predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "it is well known that some quantum correlations can violate bell inequalities , and as such can not be simulated using only shared randomness .",
    "the canonical no - go result is represented by the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh )  @xcite bell scenario , where each of @xmath12 is binary . in this scenario ,",
    "the chsh inequality defines constraints that have to be satisfied by bell - local correlations  @xcite ; these constraints can be maximally violated with judicious choices of measurements @xmath13 , @xmath14 when alice and bob share for instance a two - qubit singlet state @xmath15 , with @xmath16 .",
    "note that only entangled states @xmath2 can generate bell - nonlocal correlations ; entanglement is however not a sufficient resource , as some entangled states can only generate bell - local correlations when measured one copy at a time  @xcite .",
    "when any amount of communication is allowed , a simple strategy to achieve the simulation task is the following .",
    "alice communicates the input that she receives to bob , and then they produce outputs in accordance with some pre - established strategy via shared randomness",
    ". however , there may be more efficient strategies when more inputs are considered : for instance , the simulation of all projective measurements on the singlet state can be achieved using only one bit of communication in addition to shared randomness  @xcite .",
    "let us now consider a variant inspired by buscemi s work  @xcite .",
    "the scenario of a quantum - input simulation task is defined via the 5-tuple @xmath17 where the superscripts identify the relevant subsystems ( see figure  [ fig : scenarios ] ) ; the sets @xmath18,@xmath19 specify the quantum input states prodived to alice and bob , while @xmath20 and @xmath21 are povm elements acting respectively on the systems aa and bb. as with the standard simulation task , alice and bob are given beforehand classical descriptions of the 5-tuple specifying the scenario and are assumed to have access to shared randomness .",
    "however , instead of a classical description of the inputs @xmath0 and @xmath1 , in each round of the simulation task , alice and bob now receive respectively from external state preparation devices the quantum states @xmath22 and @xmath23 to be measured jointly with @xmath2 .",
    "the goal here is again for alice and bob to produce , possibly with the help of classical communication , outputs @xmath3 and @xmath4 such that they reproduce exactly the conditional probability distribution    @xmath24,\\ ] ]    as predicted by quantum mechanics .",
    "the correlations   can also be written in a similar form as  , namely @xmath25,\\ ] ] where the operators @xmath26 describe alice and bob s effective povms acting on @xmath2 , for each input state @xmath27 . here",
    ", in contrast to standard simulation tasks  , alice and bob do not know _ a priori _ which effective povms @xmath28 and @xmath29 they should simulate , as they do not know ( and may not able to determine with certainty ) the classical indices @xmath0,@xmath1 of their quantum inputs @xmath5,@xmath6 : these states are indeed chosen randomly and prepared by external devices they do not control and @xmath1 are provided by an external agent or randomly chosen by the parties provided that such a choice is independent of any underlying variables describing the system@xcite . ] .",
    "note however that when all alice s ( respectively bob s ) input states @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) are orthogonal to one another , alice ( bob ) can perfectly distinguish them ; then the qi simulation task simply reduces to the standard one . as such",
    ", there is a distinction between the two tasks only when the quantum input states are non - orthogonal , and therefore non - distinguishable .",
    "note that the non - orthogonality of the set of quantum input states only implies , according to quantum theory , that the received state can not be determined with certainty .",
    "if the states in @xmath32 are non - orthogonal but still linearly independent , they can be unambiguously discriminated with a non - zero probability of getting a conclusive answer  @xcite .",
    "we already know from buscemi s result  @xcite that all entangled quantum states can produce correlations that are non - simulable when both parties perform only arbitrary local operations assisted by shared randomness ( losr ) . clearly , a natural follow - up question is whether classical communication could help in the simulation of these correlations , in the paradigm of local operations and classical communication ( locc ) .",
    "we answer below this question by the negative , showing that any entangled state can produce correlations that can not be reproduced using locc . to do so",
    ", we first define a canonical qi simulation task relevant for entangled states of dimension @xmath33 .",
    "we then construct , for any such state , an explicit bell - like inequality violated by the correlations of the given entangled state but otherwise satisfied by locc resources .",
    "we consider a state @xmath2 of dimension @xmath34 , and prescribe the following : alice and bob perform local measurements @xmath35 with binary outcomes @xmath36 , where the outcome @xmath3 or @xmath37 corresponds to the successful projection onto the maximally entangled state @xmath38 .",
    "thus : @xmath39    the input states are chosen to have the same dimensions as the respective subsystem of a and b in @xmath2 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and constructed such that the corresponding density matrices @xmath42 , @xmath43 span the space of linear operators acting on @xmath44 , @xmath45 , as is also done in the proof and example of  @xcite .",
    "such sets can always be constructed using the minimal number @xmath46 of elements , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "together with @xmath2 , these elements define completely our quantum - input simulation task .",
    "the effective povms applied to @xmath2 are then described [ from eq .  ] by @xmath49 where @xmath50 indicates transposition in the computational bases @xmath51 of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "as a concrete example , consider the case where alice and bob share the singlet state @xmath15 .",
    "the input states can for instance be chosen as the vertices of a regular tetrahedron on the surface of the bloch sphere . using @xmath52 the vector of pauli matrices , and @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 ,",
    "we define , for @xmath57 : @xmath58 the resulting correlations are then : @xmath59 \\ !",
    "\\dfrac{7 - 5a-5b+4ab}{12 } & \\!\\ !",
    "\\text { otherwise}. \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eq : singlet_correlations}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this means that alice and bob must _ never _ output @xmath60 when their input states are identical , but must otherwise produce this combination of outputs with some non - zero probability . recall that alice and bob only have access to their respective quantum states @xmath5 and @xmath6 and not their classical labels @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "since these input states are not linearly independent , they can not be unambiguously distinguished from one another  @xcite , i.e. alice and bob are bound to make mistakes if they try to guess the classical label @xmath0 and @xmath1 in some rounds of the simulation ; thus the task of reproducing the correlations in eq .   can not be achieved perfectly if alice and bob only make use of shared randomness and classical communication .",
    "the no - go result given in the previous paragraph is in fact not specific to pure two - qubit maximally - entangled states , but rather is a general feature of all entangled states , as we shall demonstrate by constructing an explicit bell - like inequality in the following theorem and proof :    [ thm1 ]    for any entangled quantum state @xmath61 of dimension @xmath33 , and sets of inputs states @xmath62 , @xmath63 whose corresponding density matrices are informationally complete ( i.e. span the space of linear operators acting on @xmath44 , @xmath45 respectively ) , there exist real coefficients @xmath64 defining a bell - like inequality @xmath65 which is satisfied by all correlations obtainable from locc , but is violated by the quantum correlation @xmath66 obtained from the entangled state @xmath61 , when alice and bob perform projections onto a maximally entangled state as in  .",
    "any entangled state can generate correlations that can not be simulated by classical resources in a quantum input simulation task .",
    "we use the fact that for any entangled state @xmath61 , there exists a positive ( but not completely positive ) map @xmath67 , such that @xmath68 is not positive  @xcite ; it has at least one eigenstate @xmath69 with negative eigenvalue @xmath70 . let us denote by @xmath71 the ( positive ) dual map of @xmath67 ( defined such that @xmath72 = \\text{tr}[\\lambda(m ) \\cdot n]$ ] for all linear operators @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) , and let us decompose the hermitian operator @xmath75 as follows :    @xmath76    where @xmath64 are real coefficients .",
    "note that such a decomposition is always possible of @xmath68 with negative eigenvalue is such that @xmath75 can be decomposed as in  ; the information - completeness assumption guarantees that this is indeed possible , but this assumption is not always necessary .",

    "the coefficients @xmath64 introduced in   are used to define the linear combination @xmath85 in  .    [ [ i ] ] ( i ) + + +    to show that inequality   holds true for all correlations @xmath86 that can be obtained from locc operations , we shall now recall that all classes of locc operations , distinguished by the amount and/or number of rounds of communication  @xcite , are included in the set of so - called separable operations  @xcite . as a result , the set of correlations obtainable by performing arbitrary locc operations on the input states @xmath27 ( _ locc correlations _",
    ", for short ) is included in the set of correlations obtainable from separable measurements on @xmath27 .",
    "our strategy is to prove that inequality   holds for all separable measurements , which in turn , implies that it also holds for all locc correlations .",
    "let then @xmath87 be the correlations obtained from some separable measurements on @xmath27 . in our qi simulation task ,",
    "such correlations take the form of :    @xmath88,\\ ] ]    where the @xmath89 are some povm elements corresponding to outcomes @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the separability constraint implies that for each @xmath3 and @xmath4 , these can be decomposed as @xmath90 , where the @xmath91 and @xmath92 are positive operators  @xcite .",
    "thus : @xmath93 \\nonumber \\\\   & = \\sum_k \\ \\text{tr } [ { \\mathbbm{1}}\\!\\otimes\\ ! \\lambda^{\\ ! * } ( { { |\\xi\\rangle\\!\\langle\\xi| } } ) \\cdot ( \\pi_{11}^{\\text{a},k } \\otimes \\pi_{11}^{\\text{b},k})^{\\top } ] = \\sum_k \\ \\text{tr } [ { { |\\xi\\rangle\\!\\langle\\xi| } } \\cdot ( \\pi_{11}^{\\text{a},k})^{\\!\\top } \\!\\!\\otimes\\ !",

    "this proves that inequality   indeed holds for separable measurements on @xmath27 .",

    ", we remark that they have , in general , two interesting properties .",
    "first , let us emphasize that these inequalities always use sets of input states that render unambiguous quantum state discrimination impossible . as seen in section  [ sec : simulationtasks ] , qi simulation tasks offer richer scenarios specifically because they allow sets of non - orthogonal quantum input states . as also noted before , non - orthogonality by itself does not rule out the possibility to perform unambiguous state discrimination ( usd )  @xcite .",
    "now , if usd was possible , alice ( bob ) could learn the classical label @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "@xmath1 ) of her state @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) with non - zero probability . then",
    ", for all @xmath0 and @xmath1 , both alice and bob would obtain conclusive results in some rounds of the simulation task .",
    "alice and bob could then coordinate to output @xmath60 only when @xmath99 is known and @xmath100 is negative , filtering out non - negative contributions to the inequality .",
    "however , this strategy can not be used against inequalities constructed in theorem  [ thm1 ] : informationally complete sets of @xmath46 rank-1 projectors in dimension @xmath101 , @xmath102 have corresponding states @xmath5 , @xmath6 linearly dependent in @xmath44 , @xmath45 , rendering usd impossible  @xcite .",
    "we also note that the bell - like inequality   can be used to certify the entanglement of any state that violates it ( and in particular the entangled state @xmath61 for which it is constructed ) .",
    "it corresponds indeed to a measurement - device - independent entanglement witness ( mdi - ew ) , as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , in a scenario with ( trusted ) quantum inputs .",
    "our proof here made use of positive but not completely positive maps , but can equivalently be based on the existence of entanglement witnesses  @xcite , as in the proof of  @xcite .",
    "our present theorem  [ thm1 ] thus implies that the mdi - ews constructed in  @xcite can be used to distinguish entangled states not only from separable states , but also from arbitrary locc resources .",
    "to provide explicit examples of bell - like inequalities , we turn to bipartite werner states . in dimension",
    "@xmath103 , they are defined as mixtures of the singlet state and the maximally mixed state : @xmath104.\\ ] ] and in arbitrary dimension @xmath105 as  @xcite : @xmath106,\\ ] ] where the flip operator @xmath107 is @xmath108 .",
    "werner states are entangled if and only if  @xcite @xmath109 ( for qubits @xmath110 ) .",
    "for some values of @xmath111 , entangled werner states are local , in the sense that their correlations in standard bell scenarios can be simulated using solely shared randomness : this is the case for correlations obtained from projective measurements  @xcite for @xmath112 ( qubits : @xmath113 ) , and for correlations obtained from povms  @xcite for @xmath114 ( qubits : @xmath115 ) .",
    "let us also recall that correlations from entangled werner states can be simulated in standard bell scenarios by using only finite communication on average  @xcite ; remarkably , for qubits , only a single bit is required in the worst case  @xcite .    in qi scenarios , in contrast ,",
    "all entangled werner states exhibit correlations that can not be simulated using locc , as we shall see explicitly below , first for qubits and then in higher dimensions .",
    "when alice and bob share the state @xmath116 , and use the inputs given in   corresponding to the measurements specified in eqs .  - ,",
    "their correlations are a mixture @xmath117 of the singlet correlations given in   and noise @xmath118 .",
    "entangled werner states have non - positive partial transposes  @xcite ; hence , the map @xmath67 introduced in our construction above can simply be taken to be the transposition ( which is self - dual ) .",
    "the four eigenvalues of the partial transpose @xmath119 of @xmath116 are @xmath120 , with the eigenvalue @xmath121 corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath119 thus has a negative eigenvalue @xmath70 if and only if @xmath110 , which indeed corresponds to the necessary and sufficient condition for @xmath116 to be entangled .",

    "note that the bell - like inequality thus obtained is exactly the same as the first mdi - ew derived in ref .",

    "inspired by buscemi s generalization of standard bell scenarios , where the parties are provided external quantum input states , we have introduced the notion of quantum input simulation tasks . within the framework of such tasks",
    ", we showed that if separated parties only have access to shared randomness and classical communications , the set of correlations that they can produce must satisfy some bell - like inequalities that can however be violated by entangled quantum states , thus establishing a new feature of quantum entanglement .",
    "our no - simulation result thus improves over those derived from standard bell scenarios in two aspects : firstly , our inequalities can be violated by entangled states which do not violate any bell inequality at the single - copy level .",
    "secondly , bell inequalities can always be violated using classical communication  @xcite , whereas such classical resources never violate our inequalities .    in experimental setups ,",
    "such a construction can be used to check that alice and bob share quantum resources ( be it an entangled state or a quantum channel ) when their measurements are not performed in a space - like separated way .",
    "the robustness of our scheme against imperfections in the preparation of the quantum inputs is left for future work ; a brief discussion of the effect of losses can be found in  @xcite .    from an information - theoretic perspective ,",
    "our results reinforce the point that _ all _ entangled states have an edge over classical resources in their information processing capacities , in particular in the context of certain bipartite simulation tasks as considered here .",
    "given the rich structure of multipartite entanglement  @xcite , it would also certainly be desirable to understand how our results generalize to the multipartite scenario .",
