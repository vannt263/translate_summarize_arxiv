    "well resolve the vertical scale height of two edge on debris disks , the 12myr old @xcite dusty circumstellar disks of the m1ve star au microscopii ( au  mic ) and the a5v star @xmath2  pictoris ( @xmath2  pic ) @xcite .",
    "also resolved is the inner edge of fomalhaut s eccentric ring also allowing a measurement of the disk scale height @xcite .",
    "the vertical scale height , @xmath3 , is related to the inclination dispersion of dust particles and so allows an estimate of the velocity dispersion of the smallest particles .",
    "the velocity dispersion of planetesimals sets the energy of inter - particle collisions and so affects a calculation of the dust production rate through a collisional cascade ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the velocity dispersion is also sensitive to the presence of larger bodies in the disk as gravitational scattering or stirring causes an increase in the velocity dispersion with time ( e.g. , @xcite ) . here by combining observations of observed vertical thickness with estimates for the dust production and gravitational stirring rates we will place constraints on the underlying planetesimal population in these disks . because of the difficulty in resolving vertical structure , previous cascade calculations have not used a velocity dispersion consistent with that estimated for these disks or estimated the role of gravitational stirring .",
    "we consider three disks with resolved vertical scale heights .",
    "the properties of these three systems along with the quantities we estimate from them are listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] . for au mic and",
    "@xmath2  pic we list properties at the radius , @xmath4 , from the star where there is break in the surface brightness profile . for fomalhaut , we list properties in the ring edge .",
    "one of the observed quantities is the optical depth , @xmath5 , at wavelength , @xmath6 , normal to the disk plane .",
    "because the absorption or emissivity coefficient of a dust grain with radius @xmath7 is reduced for @xmath8 , and there are more dust grains with smaller radii , we expect the optical depth to be related to the number density of particles of radius @xmath9 ( e.g. , see discussion in section 4 by @xcite ) .",
    "as we only detect the dust particles in scattered light or in thermal emission , we use scaling arguments to estimate the number of larger bodies residing in the disk .",
    "another observed quantity is the disk thickness that we describe in terms of a scale height @xmath3 that here is a half width .",
    "the disk aspect ratio is the scale height divided by radius ; @xmath10 .",
    "a population of low inclination orbits has @xmath11 , so @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 and @xmath14 is the inclination dispersion .",
    "subsequently we also refer to @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the eccentricity dispersion .",
    "we assume a rayleigh distribution of particle inclinations and eccentricities .",
    "we review how the dust opacity and disk thickness can be used to estimate the planetesimal size distribution .",
    "dust production in a destructive collisional cascade can in its simplest form be studied with a power law size distribution .",
    "the single power law form for the size distribution is in part based on the simplest assumption that the specific energy ( kinetic energy per unit mass ) , @xmath17 , required to catastrophically disrupt a body is a fixed number independent of body radius ; ( often @xmath18erg  g@xmath19 for icy bodies is used based on the estimates by @xcite ) .",
    "the number of particles with radius @xmath7 in a logarithmic bin of size @xmath20 is predicted to be @xmath21 using a logarithmic bin gives the same scaling with @xmath7 as a cumulative distribution @xmath22 ( see appendix a by @xcite ) . in an infinite destructive self - similar collisional cascade ,",
    "the exponent is predicted to be @xmath23 @xcite . the main asteroid belt , if fit with a single power law , has a lower exponent of @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "it is collisionally evolved but deviates from @xmath25 because of additional removal mechanisms ( e.g. , yarkovsky drift and resonances ) and because the material properties depend non trivially on size @xcite .",
    "in contrast the larger bodies in the kuiper belt are consistent with @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "because of their low number these do not collide often enough to be part of an ongoing destructive collisional cascade .",
    "the high exponent probably reflects conditions during the early solar system when planetesimals were growing as well as colliding ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the number of objects of radius @xmath7 can be estimated from another of radius @xmath27 using the scaling relation @xmath28 this relates the number of larger particles to the smallest and so observable particles .",
    "estimates of the number of dust particles , @xmath29 , as a function of their radius , @xmath27 , can be made from studies of optical , infrared and submillimeter observations .",
    "it must be kept in mind that because of the uncertainty in the exponent @xmath30 , it is difficult to be accurate when extrapolating over orders of magnitude in the size distribution .",
    "the fractional area covered by particles of radius @xmath7 or @xmath31 in a log radial bin can be similarly estimated . because the opacity depends on the number per unit area times the cross section area , our assumed power law gives for the opacity integrated over a log radial bin @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the number of particles per unit area with radius @xmath27 in a log radial bin .",
    "likewise the surface mass density @xmath35 where @xmath36 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "most of the disk mass is in the largest particles or at the top of the cascade .",
    "gravitational stirring and dynamical friction heating and cooling rates are proportional to the product of the surface density time the mass ( e.g. , equations 6.1 and 6.2 by @xcite ) , scaling as @xmath37 where @xmath38 . even when the size distribution is as steep as that for the large objects in the kuiper belt ( @xmath26 ) gravitational stirring is dominated by the largest bodies .",
    "the optical depth is related to the collision time . for a population of identical objects the collision timescale @xmath39 @xcite where @xmath40 is the mean motion ( angular rotation rate for a particle in a circular orbit ) at radius @xmath4 .",
    "since the collision lifetime is proportional to the inverse of the optical depth , the timescale for a particle of radius @xmath7 to hit another with the same size scale ( again in log radial bins ) is @xmath41 as explored by @xcite , smaller particles are capable of dispersing a larger one if the specific energy of the collision exceeds the critical value .",
    "the collision lifetime is shorter by a factor of @xmath42 ( equation 21,22 and associated discussion by @xcite ) , where @xmath43 is the radius of a smaller particle capable of disrupting one with radius @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 is estimated by considering what energy projectile object can disrupt the target , @xmath45 ( approximating equation 25 by @xcite ) , where @xmath46 is the relative or inter - particle velocity dispersion .",
    "we expect the relative velocity dispersion is twice the particle velocity dispersion or @xmath47 .",
    "we can now estimate the collisional lifetime for particles in a log radial bin taking into account collisions with smaller particles . after multiplying by equation [ eqn : eps ] , equation",
    "[ eqn : tcolsimple ] becomes @xmath48 for @xmath25 , the timescale @xmath49 consistent with equation 23 by @xcite .",
    "the maximum radius object that will disrupt during the lifetime of the system is found by setting @xmath50 to the age of the system , @xmath51 , and solving equation [ eqn : tcol ] for @xmath7 .",
    "this estimate was also used by @xcite in their section 5.3 . in other words",
    "we define a radius , @xmath52 such that @xmath53 or @xmath54 for @xmath25 this gives @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the rotation period at radius @xmath4 .",
    "if the disk is hotter or older then a higher surface density disk that contains more massive bodies is required to initiate the collisional cascade and account for the dust production .",
    "objects of radius @xmath52 are those likely to be currently initiating the collisional cascade . using equation [ eqn : sig_cascade ] with @xmath52 we can estimate the total surface density in these massive objects . as the disk grinds up and is depleted , more massive but lower number density objects can enter and generate the cascade .",
    "we first relate the disk aspect ratio , @xmath57 , to the velocity dispersion and the inclination and eccentricity dispersions .",
    "a population of low inclination orbits has @xmath11 , so @xmath12 .",
    "an isotropically scattering disk is expected to have @xmath58 ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at low eccentricity ,",
    "the radial velocity dispersion is @xmath59 , and the tangential and vertical velocity dispersions are @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the velocity of a particle in a circular orbit ( e.g. , see equations c10a , b by @xcite ) .",
    "the total velocity dispersion is the sum of the three velocity components corresponding to @xmath62 or @xmath63 these approximations are consistent with @xmath64 used by previous studies @xcite .",
    "in equation [ eqn : tauq ] we described the scaling of opacity in a log radial bin .",
    "the normal disk opacity inferred from observations at wavelength @xmath6 , depends on the disk emissivity or absorption coefficient ( here denoted @xmath65 ) @xmath66 this is consistent with our definition for @xmath31 ( equation [ eqn : tauq ] ) and approximations commonly used in interpreting observed fluxes ( e.g. , equation 1 by @xcite relating dust opacity to flux and the definition given in the caption of fig .",
    "6 by @xcite ) .",
    "the simplest models for the absorption or emissivity coefficient of a particle estimate that these coefficients are @xmath67 ( e.g. , @xcite ) with @xmath68 . for @xmath68 and @xmath69 by integrating equation [ eqn : bartau ] we find that @xmath70 .",
    "more detailed modeling of the absorption coefficients ( e.g. , @xcite ) shows deviations from this simplest model with strong structure at specific wavelengths such as the @xmath71 m silicate feature . in addition ,",
    "the exponent @xmath30 , describing the dust size distribution , may not be well constrained or may not be the same for small dust particles as for larger ones ( e.g. , @xcite ) or for cm or m sized bodies .",
    "the wavelength at which the absorption coefficient begins to drop for equation [ eqn : qabs ] may depend on dust composition ( see discussion in appendix d by @xcite ) .",
    "multi - wavelength observations are required to better model the size distribution and composition of the dust . to take this uncertainty into account we describe our estimates in terms of a factor @xmath72 , such that @xmath73 that relates the opacity estimated at a wavelength based on observations to the size distribution of particles with radius equal to that wavelength .",
    "an estimate of normal disk opacity at a particular radius requires modeling the surface brightness distribution @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , normal disk opacity estimates are available only at a few wavelengths for the three disks we are considering here and not all of these are based on multi - wavelength models .",
    "while optical and near - infrared wavelength observations tend to better resolve the disks , they may not accurately predict the mm size distribution ( e.g. , see the discussion comparing the optical and near - infrared opacities to that predicted from the submillimeter for au  mic by @xcite ) . we summarize",
    "the existing observed optical depth measurements for these three disks in table [ tab : tab1 ] and in the associated table notes but note that there is uncertainty in the conversion factor @xmath72 between the measured optical depths and the opacity function that we have use here , @xmath74 , the optical depth integrated in a log radial bin of size 1 for dust particles of size @xmath75 .",
    "as the opacity of smaller grains is sensitive to the removal process as well as collisions it is important to use observed opacity that is dominated by particles that are not affected by radiative forces ( e.g. , see discussion by @xcite ) .",
    "we now convert equation [ eqn : atop ] into a form more easily computed from observables .",
    "the observables are the disk aspect ratio , @xmath57 and the normal disk opacity @xmath76 at wavelength @xmath6 .",
    "the size of the objects initiating the collisional cascade when @xmath25 @xmath77 because we have scaled with the inclination or aspect ratio instead of the collision velocity the exponent of @xmath4 and @xmath78 differ from but are consistent with equation 36 by @xcite .",
    "the relation also differs from previous work @xcite because we have based our estimate on a collision time scaled from the face on disk opacity at a particular radius rather than the total fraction of starlight re - emitted in the infrared .",
    "inserting our value for the @xmath52 into equation [ eqn : sig_cascade ] yields an estimate for the total disk density , @xmath79 we have assumed here that the collision cascade started very early in the life of the system , however at early stages the inter - particle velocities were probably not high enough for destructive collisions @xcite .",
    "if the timescale of the destructive cascade were smaller then @xmath52 and @xmath80 would both be smaller than the estimates given above .    the product of the density times the mass for the bodies initiating the cascade @xmath52 @xmath81",
    "we explore the idea that the observed thickness of the disk is due to gravitational stirring by bodies of mass , @xmath82 , surface density , @xmath83 , and size @xmath84 .",
    "we define a mass ratio @xmath85 , and surface density ratio @xmath86 .",
    "if the disk is in collisional equilibrium then we expect that @xmath87 . in the dispersion dominated regime , and assuming that the dispersions of the tracer particles exceed those of the massive particles doing the stirring ( @xmath88 and @xmath89 ) @xmath90 ( based on equation 6.2 by @xcite ) where @xmath91 ( corresponding to equation 2.11 by @xcite ) .",

    ", @xmath96 , only depends logarithmically on @xmath94 we can use the scale height estimated from observations to estimate @xmath94 and we can solve equation [ eqn : gravstir ] finding that @xmath97 , specifically @xmath98 the above equation can be inverted at time @xmath51 @xmath99 where we have set @xmath56 to be the rotation period at @xmath4 . in terms of observables",
    "this leads to a constraint on the largest bodies with size @xmath84 @xmath100 we note that the constraint on the product of the surface density times the mass of the largest bodies is independent of the disk opacity .",
    "in contrast the estimates for the top of the collisional cascade ( size of object and density ) are sensitive to the dust opacity .",
    "equation [ eqn : atopnum ] gives us an estimate for the size of the bodies at the top of the collisional cascade , and equation [ eqn : sigmnum ] gives us the surface density times mass in the disk for these bodies .",
    "this product is well below that needed to account for the disk thickness with gravitational stirring ( equation [ eqn : sigmgrav ] ) . to find the size , @xmath84 , of the bodies responsible for the gravitational stirring",
    "we must extend the size distribution beyond @xmath52 .",
    "unfortunately , for bodies with sizes @xmath101 we can no longer assume a size distribution consistent with a collisional cascade .",
    "there are few guidelines on what type of power law to use for bodies greater than 10 km .",
    "the only known system that differs significantly from the size distribution expected from collisional evolution might be the largest bodies in the kuiper belt that have size distribution with power law @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "a variety of size distributions might be produced during the phase of planetesimal growth with low values for the exponent @xmath30 at the high mass end implying runaway growth ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to place constraints on the size and density of the largest bodies and exponent of the size distribution for these bodies we compare our constraint on the product of the surface density and mass of the largest bodies to the surface density and size of the bodies initiating the collisional cascade .    in figure [",

    "we attribute the differences in these figures primarily to the observed thickness as @xmath114 ( equation [ eqn : atopnum ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , the bodies we infer at the top of the collisional cascade are not sufficiently dense and massive to account for the thickness of this disk .",
    "a comparison between the surface densities in the bodies required to account for the disk thickness and that predicted at the top of the collision cascade allows exponents @xmath115 and @xmath116 for the three disks au  mic , @xmath2-pic and fomalhaut , respectively .",
    "the extremely shallow exponent for au  mic at the top end suggests that the size distribution deviates from power law form .",
    "a curve in the size distribution at the high mass end has been predicted by models and simulations of planetesimal accretion when the disk contain embryos in a stage of runaway growth @xcite .",
    "we have only considered the effect of gravitational stirring in the dispersion dominated regime .",

    "does a body s hill radius approach a scale height @xmath118 for an inclination @xmath119 .",
    "the dispersion dominated gravitational stirring estimate used in equation [ eqn : gravstir ] ( rather than a sheer dominated one ) is therefor reasonable .",
    "previous work has found that passage through the sheer dominated regime is comparatively fast ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a better estimate would take into account both regimes , though the improved constraints on the massive bodies should not significantly deviate from those estimated here .",
    "we have used estimates of collisional cascades ( e.g. , @xcite ) to estimate the size and surface density of the bodies responsible for initiating the collisional cascade .",
    "we have done this for 3 debris disks , that of au mic , @xmath2-pic and fomalhaut , with resolved vertical structure estimating that these bodies have radii of 4 , 180 , and 70 km , respectively .",
    "we have estimated these at the radius at which the surface brightness profile changes slope ( also called the break radius ) .",
    "the body sizes are a few times larger than previous estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the differences arise because we have based our estimate on a collision time scaled from the face on disk opacity at a particular radius rather than the total fraction of starlight re - emitted in the infrared and we have used the observed disk aspect ratio to estimate the velocity of collisions .    assuming that the smallest particles are heated solely by gravitational stirring from the largest ones , the disk thickness can be used to place a constraint on the product of the surface density times mass of the largest bodies ( equation [ eqn : sigmnum ] ) . from this",
    "we infer that 1000 km radius bodies or planetary embryos are likely to reside in these three disks .",
    "the large body sizes do not conflict with the lack of observed gaps in the disks @xcite except possibly for the extreme high mass end allowed for @xmath2-pic s disk . a comparison between the surface densities in these bodies and that predicted at the top of the collision cascade allows exponents @xmath120 for the three disks au  mic , @xmath2-pic and fomalhaut , respectively .",
    "the shallow exponent for au  mic at the top end suggests that this disk contains embryos in a stage of runaway growth , as predicted by simulations @xcite .",
    "for all three disks we infer that most of the disk mass is likely to reside in embryos and estimate that the surface densities are of order @xmath121 g  @xmath1 .",
    "a number of simplifying assumptions went into estimating the properties of the top of the cascade .",
    "we assumed only a single power law form for the size distribution , however , the specific energy for dispersion is predicted to depend on body size @xcite so a single power law is probably not a good assumption .",
    "the disks may not have been sufficiently excited for efficient dust production during the entire lifetime of these systems @xcite .",
    "a shorter collisional lifetime would lead to a lower surface density and size estimated for the top of the cascade ( see equations [ eqn : signum ] , [ eqn : atopnum ] ) , though taking into account the dependence of the specific energy on size in the regime where self - gravity is important would increase the surface density of larger bodies and might decrease the size at the top of the cascade .",
    "the sizes at the top of the cascade predicted here are nearing the threshold for a destructive equal - mass collision at a velocity estimated from the disk thickness , particularly in the case of fomalhaut that has a very thin disk but has a large estimated @xmath52 .",
    "our estimate of the gravitational stirring rate neglected the role of dynamical friction from smaller particles and the sheer dominated regime .",
    "both should be taken into account to improve the estimate of size and number of the largest bodies residing in these disks .",
    "better modeling of the dust distribution using multi - wavelength observations and high angular resolution imaging would significantly improve constraints on the small radius end of the size distribution .",
    "while we have found normal disk opacity measurements in a few wavelengths in the literature , the different wavelength estimates , different assumptions for the assumed size distributions and different procedures for modeling the data make it difficult to constrain and compare the dust size distributions and normal disk opacities among the disks .",
    "we have discussed ways to improve the estimates introduced here .",
    "we now discuss possible implications based on these predictions .",
    "if the size distributions inferred here are common then longer lifetimes would be predicted for dust production because the larger bodies ( inferred here ) , entering the cascade later , contain a reservoir of mass available for dust production at later times .",
    "the distribution of disk properties as a function of age can be used to place constraints on planetesimal growth models as well as dust production .",
    "we have only considered opacities at particular radii for these disks . for au mic and @xmath2-pic we chose radii",
    "at which there is a break ( or change in slope ) in the surface brightness profile .",
    "if the disk aspect ratios do not strongly vary with radius then equation [ eqn : sigmgrav ] implies that the product of the mass times the surface density in the largest bodies , @xmath122 is only weakly decaying with radius .",
    "compare this to @xmath123 and @xmath124 predicted via equations [ eqn : atopnum],[eqn : signum ] .",
    "both @xmath80 and @xmath52 must drop rapidly with radius .",
    "if disks are not extremely thin at larger radii then either there is another source of heating at large radii accounting for the disk thickness , or dust particles detected at large radii originate from inner radii and are either blown out or are on highly eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "a thin and sparse disk will not efficiently produce dust as the collisions are not destructive .",
    "consequently multi - wavelength observations resolving disks as a function of radius should be able to test the utility of the estimates explored here as well as better probe planetesimal growth and evolution with radius .",
