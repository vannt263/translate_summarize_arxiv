    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is already operational and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is the basic theory which is used to set up the initial conditions for the collisions at the lhc as well as to calculate hadronic observables .",
    "the application of perturbative qcd relies on the so called factorization theorems which allow to decompose a given process into a long distance part , called parton density , and a short distance part , called matrix element . here",
    "we will focus on high energy factorization @xcite .",
    "the evolution equations of high energy factorization sum up logarithms of energy accompanied by a strong coupling constant , i.e. terms proportional to @xmath0 , which applies when the total energy of a scattering process is much bigger than any other hard scale involved in a process .    until now , in principle , the bfkl @xcite , bk @xcite and ccfm @xcite evolution equations were used on equal footing since the energy ranges did not allow to discriminate between these frameworks . however , there were indications already at hera @xcite for the need to account for nonlinear effects in gluon density .",
    "these observation are supported by recent results obtained in @xcite . on top of this , the results from @xcite point at the need to use the framework which incorporates hardness of the collision into bfkl like description . with the lhc one entered into a region of phase space where both the energy and momentum transfers are high .",
    "therefore , one should provide a framework where both dense systems and hard processes can be studied .",
    "this might be achieved with a relatively simple nonlinear extension of the ccfm equation where one could take into account both the gluon production and recombination in the description of final states .    in this paper",

    "the singularity in the unresolved real contribution of the @xmath1-channel real gluon is canceled by the virtual contribution .",
    "this is the minimal condition in order to eventually perform a monte carlo simulation based on the bk equation .",
    "however , the bk equation concerns inclusive observables and does not allow for applications to the description of exclusive final states .",
    "thus , we need the ccfm equation which is applicable to the description of the exclusive processes .",
    "we propose the nonlinear extension of the ccfm equation being motivated by the resumed form of the bk equation in which we replace the regge form factor by the non - sudakov form factor and introduce angular ordering ( coherence ) .",

    "it is enough to mention that the nonlinearity which suppresses contributions from gluons with low transversal momenta makes the dependence on the non - sudakov s form subleading .",

    "the nonlinear term in ( [ eq : final1 ] ) , apart from allowing for recombination of gluons might be understood as a way to introduce the decoherence into the emission pattern of gluons .",
    "this is because the gluon density is build up due to coherent gluon emission and since the nonlinear term comes with the negative sign it slows down the growth of gluon density and therefore it introduces the decoherence .",
    "+ we expect the nonlinear term to be of main importance at low @xmath2 similarly as in case of the bk equation . in this limit",
    "it will be of special interest to check whether in this formulation of the nonlinear extension of the ccfm equation one obtains an effect of saturation of the saturation scale as observed in @xcite . in the mentioned paper it has beens",
    "stated that extension of the ccfm equation which mimics saturation by special boundary conditions generates saturation scale which saturates itself due to constraints on the phase space coming from maximal allowed scale by the kinematics .",
    "this effect is of great importance since it has a consequences for example for imposing a bound on amount of production of entropy from saturated part of gluon density as observed in @xcite .",
    "another interesting limit is the large @xmath2 region of the phase space where the nonlinear effects are believed to be subleading and can be safely neglected .",
    "however , since the ccfm extends beyond bfkl asymptotics , with the presented formulation one can study onset of saturation in a function of @xmath2 .",
    "in this paper we have studied the high energy factorizable evolution equations .",
    "we obtained a new form of the bk equation where the unresolved real and virtual contributions in the linear part of the kernel are resummed . on top of this , both the linear part and nonlinear pieces became folded with the regge form factor .",
    "the obtained representation of the bk equation might likely be useful in future monte carlo solution .",
    "however , in order for it to be useful for phenomenological studies of exclusive final states one has to take also into account angular ordering of gluon emissions .",
    "this we do by extending the ccfm equation by nonlinear term following the suggestive form of the bk equation in the exclusive representation . in a future",
