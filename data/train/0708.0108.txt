    "let @xmath2 be a global field with adle ring @xmath6 and let @xmath7 be a linear algebraic group over @xmath2 .",

    "metaplectic extension _ of @xmath7 by @xmath9 is a topological central extension : @xmath10 which splits over the discrete subgroup @xmath11 of @xmath8 .",
    "such extensions are of use in the theory of automorphic forms since certain automorphic forms ( for example the classical theta - functions , see @xcite ) may be regarded as functions on @xmath12 , which are invariant under translation by the lift of @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "the groups @xmath12 are topological groups but they are not in general groups of adle valued points of an algebraic group .    if @xmath2 contains a primitive @xmath0-th root of unity , then the group @xmath5 has a canonical metaplectic extension with kernel the group @xmath13 of all @xmath0-th roots of unity in @xmath2 .",
    "this extension is always non - trivial ; in fact if @xmath0 is the total number of roots of unity in @xmath2 and if @xmath14 , then the canonical extension is universal amongst metaplectic extensions .    as the groups @xmath3 and @xmath4 are not perfect , @xmath1 has no universal metaplectic extension .",
    "however the canonical extension of @xmath5 may be continued in various ways to give a metaplectic extension of @xmath1 by @xmath13 .",
    "this has been done by embedding @xmath1 in @xmath15 for @xmath16 ( see @xcite ) ; we shall call the metaplectic extensions on @xmath1 obtained in this way the _",
    "standard twists_. in this paper we shall give an elementary construction of a metaplectic extension @xmath17 of @xmath1 , which in fact is not one of the standard twists , but which nevertheless restricts to the canonical metaplectic extension of @xmath5 .",
    "the method used gives an independent construction of the canonical metaplectic extension of @xmath5 .",
    "there are other ways of constructing the group @xmath17 .",
    "the advantages of the method of construction employed in this paper are as follows :    * other methods of construction require class field theory and algebraic k - theory .",
    "in contrast the method here is very elementary .",
    "in fact one can deduce certain theorems of class field theory as corollaries of the results here . *",
    "the method described here is very explicit in the sense that a 2-cocycle @xmath18 is given which represents the group extension .",
    "this means @xmath17 may be realized as a set of pairs @xmath19 with multiplication given by @xmath20 thus the cohomology class of @xmath18 is an element of @xmath21 which splits on the subgroup @xmath4 .",
    "an expression for @xmath18 as a coboundary on @xmath4 is also obtained .",
    "in contrast the usual method of construction gives only a cocycle on the standard borel subgroup .",
    "an expression for the whole cocycle has been obtained ( after various incorrect formulae obtained by other authors ) in @xcite , but the cocycle obtained there is more complicated than ours . in partiular",
    "the formula of @xcite involves first decomposing @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the bruhat decomposition , and then decomposing each of the three weyl group elements as a minimal product of simple reflections . *",
    "the cocycle @xmath18 is smooth on the non - archimedean part of @xmath3 ; in fact if @xmath2 has no real places then we obtain a cocycle which is smooth everywhere . the cocycle may therefore be used to study the smooth representations of the metaplectic group .",
    "more precisely suppose @xmath25 is an irreducible representation of @xmath17 on a space @xmath26 of smooth functions on @xmath17 , on which @xmath17 acts by right translation : @xmath27 let @xmath28 be the restriction of the central character to the subgroup @xmath13 .",
    "then @xmath26 is isomorphic to a space @xmath29 of smooth functions on @xmath3 with the twisted action : @xmath30 the isomorphism @xmath31 is given by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is defined by @xmath34 although the action ( [ actionb ] ) looks more complicated than ( [ actiona ] ) , it is perhaps easier to use in calculations as one is dealing with elements of @xmath1 .",
    "one can not do this with the cocycle of @xcite as it is not smooth ( in fact on @xmath3 with @xmath35 it is nowhere continuous ) .",
    "there are two disadvantages to the method of construction described in this paper .",
    "first , the construction is long and quite difficult .",
    "second , the part of the cocycle on the subgroup @xmath36 for @xmath37 is not very explicit . in a sense",
    "one has the same problem with the cocycle of @xcite , since it is expressed in terms of ramified hilbert symbols .",

    "we then have @xmath47 and hence : @xmath48 we shall write down explicit 2-cocycles @xmath49 on @xmath50 and @xmath51 on @xmath52 . then , for a certain compact , open subgroup @xmath53 of @xmath54 , we find a function @xmath55 such that @xmath56 it follows fairly easily from this that we can extend @xmath57 to @xmath58 in such a way that there is a unique continuous cocycle @xmath59 on @xmath60 defined by the formula @xmath61 finally we show that there is a cocycle @xmath18 on @xmath3 which is metaplectic and which extends all our cocycles .    note",
    "that this definition of @xmath59 is global ; it is defined on the dense subgroup @xmath58 and then extended by continuity to @xmath60 .",
    "it would be of some interest to find a local construction of the cocycle @xmath59 , as the ramified hilbert symbols may be expressed in terms of this cocycle via the isomorphism ( [ k2 ] ) below .",
    "however i do not know how to make such a construction .",
    "if @xmath0 is even then the cocycle @xmath18 has the surprising property that it is not , even up to a coboundary , a product of cocycles @xmath62 on the groups @xmath36 ( in contrast the standard twists are products of local cocycles ) .",
    "in fact if we write @xmath63 for the preimage of @xmath36 in @xmath17 , then the various subgroups @xmath63 do not even commute with each other .",
    "this means that irreducible representations @xmath25 of @xmath17 can not be expressed as restricted tensor products of irreducible representations of the groups @xmath63 .",

    "the commutator of @xmath71 is a continuous bimultiplicative , skew symmetric function @xmath1607 .",

    "clearly the restriction to @xmath1619 of a symmetric cocycle on @xmath1620 is symmetric .",
