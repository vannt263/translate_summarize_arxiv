    "abundance studies of sodium ( na ) for early - type stars in the upper main sequence have been insufficient , despite the astrophysical importance of this element . actually , until recently , investigations of na abundances have long been limited up to late a stars ( @xmath4  k ) , and those of higher @xmath5 from early a through b remained essentially untouched .",
    "this is presumably due to its elemental characteristics ; i.e. , an alkali element with only one valence electron weakly bound and thus its ionization potential is fairly low ( @xmath6  5.1  ev ) , which means that almost all na atoms are ionized and only a very small fraction remain neutral in the atmospheres of early - type stars . accordingly .",
    "several subordinate na  i lines of low excitation ( @xmath7  ev ) frequently used for abundance determinations in late - type fgk stars are too weak to be measurable at higher @xmath5 , while the strong resonance lines ( na  i 5890/5896 , so called d lines ) tend to be avoided because they are not easy to handle ( e.g. , non - lte effect , contamination of interstellar lines , strong parameter - sensitivity , etc . ) .",
    "nevertheless , an extensive na abundance study based on non - lte analysis of strong na  i 5890/5896 lines was challenged by takeda et al .",
    "( 2009 ; hereinafter referred to as paper  i ) for 122 unbiased sample of a - type stars ( 7000  k  @xmath8  k ) having a wide range of rotational velocities .",
    "unfortunately , the resulting abundances turned out systematically subsolar ( @xmath9  [ na / h ]  @xmath10 ) and unreliable , which was eventually interpreted as due to the considerable sensitivity of na abundances ( derived from such strongly saturated na  i d lines ) to a choice of microturbulence along with its inevitable uncertainty due to depth - dependence ( see subsection 5.3 in paper  i and the references therein )",
    ".    having learned a lessen for this problem , takeda et al .",
    "( 2012 ; hereinafter referred to as paper  ii ) then determined the abundances of na ( along with other alkalis such as li and k ) based on weaker subordinate na  i 5682/5688 lines ( less sensitive to microturbulence ) for 24 selected sharp - lined a - type stars ( @xmath11  km  s@xmath12 , 7000  k  @xmath8  k ) .",
    "interestingly , the resulting na abundances were found to tightly scale with those of fe ( cf .",
    "figure 11a in paper  ii ) , despite that fe abundances were quite diversified in those 24 sample stars including am stars ( generally showing fe enrichment ) .",
    "actually , this tendency is considered to hold for a - type stars in general , since figure 7b in paper  i definitely shows evidence of such a positive correlation ( even if [ na / h ] values themselves may suffer systematic errors ) .",
    "this correlation between na and fe has a significant implication on the understanding of the physical mechanism for producing the abundance anomalies of am stars ( a group of a - type stars generally of slow rotation ; see , e.g. , preston 1974 for a review ) , where heavier elements such as iron - group are overabundant while light elements such as cno tend to be deficient .",
    "it is generally believed that some kind of segregation process ( atomic diffusion ) in the stellar envelope ( depending on the balance between the downward gravitational settlement and upward radiative acceleration ) is responsible for these peculiarities . however , since none of the existing theoretical calculations for am stars ( e.g. , richer et al . 2000 or",
    "talon et al .",
    "2006 ) has predicted that fe and na behave in the same way , this observational facts may require that the theory should be improved .",
    "how come these two elements ( where atomic level configurations considerably differ from each other ) show similar anomalies ?    here , we should recall that another group of apparently non - magnetic chemically peculiar stars of somewhat higher @xmath5 exists at the spectral type of late b , which are namely hgmn stars ( cf .",
    "the review by preston 1974 ) sharing rather similar characteristics to those of am stars ; such as an underabundance of o coupled with an overabundance of fe ( e.g. , takeda et al . 1999 ) . actually , the possible connection between these two groups has been occasionally argued ( e.g. , adelman , adelman , & pintado 2003 ) .",
    "if so , it is worthwhile to check whether or not such a close correlation between na and fe is seen also in sharp - lined late b - type stars including hgmn stars .    as already mentioned , very few people have tried determinations of na abundances for b - type stars so far , except for the recent lte studies of fossati et al .",
    "( 2009 ) for two sharp - lined late - b stars ( 21  peg and @xmath13  cet ) .",
    "given this situation , we decided to carry out a new spectroscopic study for the abundances of o , fe , and na ( where o and fe abundances are indicators for hgmn peculiarities ) for selected 30 sharp - lined late b - type stars , with an aim to give a clear answer to this question ( i.e. , whether or not na correlates with fe also in late b - type stars ) .",
    "this time , since subordinate lines such as na  i 5682/5688 are too weak to be measurable , we have no other way than to invoke the resonance lines of na  i 5890/5896 , which are fortunately moderately weak and not strongly saturated at this range of @xmath5 ; thus , we do not suffer such problems as encountered in paper  i. the purpose of this paper is to report the outcome of this investigation .",
    "as the targets of this study , we selected 30 late b - type stars ( including a few a0 stars ) mostly with spectral classes of b6b9.5 and luminosity classes of iii  v ( cf . table 1 ) , which are comparatively sharp - lined for early - type stars ( @xmath14  km  s@xmath12 ) .    for 9 stars among these , we could avail ourselves of old spectra covering a wavelength range of 56006800  @xmath15 with a resolving power of @xmath16 , which were obtained in 2006 october by using hides spectrograph at okayama astrophysical observatory ( oao ) to determine the o and ne abundances of b - type stars .",
    "see takeda et al .",
    "( 2010 ) for more details .    regarding the other 21 stars , we carried out new observations on 2012 may 2631 again by using oao / hides , where the same slit width ( 200  @xmath17 m ) as in 2006 october observations was adopted to get spectra of @xmath18 covering the wavelength range of 51008800  @xmath15 .",
    "1200  @xmath15 because only one ccd was available .",
    "at present , hides has three mosaicked 4k@xmath192k ccds , accomplishing the whole wavelength coverage of @xmath20  @xmath15 in the mode of red cross - disperser . ]",
    "the reduction of these new 2012 spectra was done in the same manner as in 2006 data , and s / n ratios typically on the order of @xmath21 were attained . for both of the 2006 and 2012 data , telluric lines existing in the region of",
    "na  i 5890/5896 lines were removed by dividing the spectra by that of a rapid rotator as done in paper  i.    these 30 program stars are plotted on the @xmath22 vs. @xmath23 diagram ( theoretical hr diagram ) in figure 1 , where girardi et al.s ( 2000 ) theoretical evolutionary tracks corresponding to different stellar masses are also depicted .",
    "we can see from this figure that the masses of our sample stars are in the range between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "in order to maintain consistency with our recent studies ( paper  i , paper  ii , takeda et al .",
    "2010 ) , the effective temperature ( @xmath5 ) and the surface gravity ( @xmath26 ) of each program star were determined from the colors of strmgren s @xmath27 photometric system with the help of napiwotzki , scnberner , and wenske s ( 1993 ) uvbybetanew programhttp://www.astro.le.ac.uk/~rn38/uvbybeta.html@xmath28 .",
    "] , where the observational data of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 were taken from hauck and mermilliod ( 1998 ) via the simbad database .",
    "the resulting @xmath5 and @xmath26 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "their typical errors may be estimated as @xmath33 in @xmath5 and @xmath34  dex in @xmath26 for the present case of late b stars , according to napiwotzki et al .",
    "( 1993 ; cf . their section 5 ) . and @xmath26 by using moon s ( 1985 ) uvbybeta / tefflogg program based on moon and dworetsky s ( 1985 ) calibration , which may be better for stars of the relevant spectral type according to kaiser ( 2006 ) .",
    "we then found that the resulting values of @xmath5 are slightly ( but systematically ) higher by @xmath21  k ( @xmath35  k ) while those of @xmath26 are practically the same ( @xmath36  dex ) , compared to our adopted parameters based on the napiwotzki et al.s ( 1993 ) uvbybetanew program .",
    "therefore , we should bear in mind the possibility that our @xmath5 given in table 1 might be slightly underestimated by @xmath21  k on the average , though this is still within the considered uncertainty ( @xmath37 ) . ]    the model atmosphere for each star was then constructed by two - dimensionally interpolating kurucz s ( 1993 ) atlas9 model grid in terms of @xmath5 and @xmath26 , where the solar - metallicity models were exclusively used as in our previous studies .    regarding the microturbulent velocity ( @xmath38 ) , we assume @xmath39  km  s@xmath12 with uncertainties of @xmath40  km  s@xmath12 in this study ,  km  s@xmath12 with uncertainties of @xmath41  km  s@xmath12 based on the results of lyubimkov , rostopchin , and lambert ( 2004 ) , since b - type main - sequence stars in a much wider @xmath5 range ( 10000  k  @xmath42  k , corresponding to masses of 411  @xmath43 ) were involved in that investigation . ] which we regard as most reasonable considering the published @xmath38 results for late b - type stars ( 10000  k  @xmath44  k ) typically ranging between @xmath45 and @xmath46  km  s@xmath12 ( see , e.g. , table 1 of sadakane 1990 ) .",
    "the determination procedures of elemental abundances and related quantities ( e.g. , non - lte correction , uncertainties due to ambiguities of atmospheric parameters ) are essentially the same as adopted in takeda et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , papers i and ii , and takeda et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , which consist of two consecutive steps .",
    "the first step is to find the solutions for the abundances of relevant elements , projected rotational velocity ( @xmath47 ) , and radial velocity ( @xmath48 ) such as those accomplishing the best fit ( minimizing @xmath49 residuals ) between theoretical and observed spectra , while applying the automatic fitting algorithm ( takeda 1995 ) .",
    "two wavelength regions were selected for this purpose : [ 1 ] 61456160  @xmath15 region comprising o  i 61568 and fe  ii 6147/6149 lines , which is to determine the abundances of oxygen and iron , and [ 2 ] 58885898  @xmath15 region comprising na  i 5890/5896 lines to establish the abundance of na .",
    "the adopted atomic data of important lines are presented in table 2 .",
    "how the theoretical spectrum for the converged solutions fits well with the observed spectrum is displayed in figures 2 ( region [ 1 ] ) and 3 ( region [ 2 ] ) .",

    ", @xmath47 values for very sharp - line cases ( e.g. , @xmath50  56  km  s@xmath12 ) may be somewhat overestimated because the effects of the instrumental broadening or of the macroturbulence may not be negligible compared to @xmath47 . ] resulting from region [ 1 ] fitting are presented in table 1 .",
    "note that , in the evaluation of @xmath49 residuals , we had to occasionally mask some regions showing features irrelevant to stellar spectra ; such as spurious spectrum defect ( figure 2 ) or interstellar absorption components of na  i 5890/5896 lines ( figure 3 ) , as highlighted in green in both figures .",
    "also , in the case of 58885898  @xmath15 fitting of na  i lines , @xmath47 values were often fixed at the values derived from 61456160  @xmath15 fitting , since only incomplete na  i d line profiles are available in most cases .      as the second step , with the help of kurucz s ( 1993 ) width9 program ( which had been considerably modified in various respects ;",
    "e.g. , inclusion of non - lte effects , treatment of total equivalent width for multi - component lines ; etc . ) , we computed the equivalent widths of the representative lines `` inversely '' from the abundance solutions ( resulting from spectrum synthesis ) along with the adopted atmospheric model / parameters ; i.e. , @xmath52 ( for fe  ii 6147 ) , @xmath53 ( for o  i 61568 merged triplet ) , and @xmath54 ( for na  i 5890 ) .    since the non - lte effect was explicitly taken into consideration for o and na as done in papers i , ii , and takeda et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2010 ) , @xmath55 ( nlte abundance ) and @xmath56 ( lte abundance ) were computed from @xmath53 and @xmath54 , from which the nlte correction @xmath57 was further derived .",
    "the resulting nlte abundances and corrections for o and na , as well as the lte abundances for fe , are given in table 1 .",
    "although only the results for the stronger na  i 5890 line of the doublet are given in table 1 , those for the weaker na  i 5896 are well represented by the following formula : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are measured in m@xmath15 , and @xmath61 as expected , inequality relations of @xmath62 and @xmath63 generally hold .",
    "we then estimated six kinds of abundance variations ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 ) for @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 by repeating the analysis on the @xmath73 values while perturbing the standard atmospheric parameters interchangeably by @xmath74 in @xmath5 , @xmath75  dex in @xmath26 , and @xmath40  km  s@xmath12 in @xmath38 ( which are the typical ambiguities of the parameters we adopted ; cf . section 3 ) .",
    "finally , the root - sum - square of these perturbations , @xmath76 , were regarded as abundance uncertainties ( due to combined errors in @xmath5 , @xmath26 , and @xmath38 ) , where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 are defined as @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , respectively .",
    "figures 4(o ) , 5(na ) , and 6(fe ) graphically show the resulting abundances , equivalent widths , non - lte corrections ( or @xmath47 in figure 6 ) , and abundance variations in response to parameter changes , as functions of @xmath5 .",
    "we can see from these figures that , while the extents of non - lte corrections for o  i 61568 are not very significant ( typically @xmath6  0.10.2  dex ) , those for na  i  5890 are significantly large and non - negligible ( @xmath6  0.30.5  dex ) . besides , the abundance errors due to parameter uncertainties are typically @xmath6  0.10.2  dex for na and fe ( though errors in na may grow up to @xmath83  0.3  dex for near - a0 stars with @xmath84  k ) , while those for o are not important ( @xmath85  dex ) .",
    "in order to discuss the results derived in section 4 , the mutual relations between [ o / h ] , [ na / h ] , and [ fe / h ] ( the differential abundances relative to the sun ) as well as their behaviors with respect to @xmath47 are displayed in figure 7 , where stars with @xmath87  k and @xmath88  k are discriminated in different symbols .",
    "we can barely recognize the weak @xmath47-dependence in [ o / h ] ( figure 7d ) and [ fe / h ] ( figure 7f ) ( i.e. , o tends to be deficient while fe to be overabundant with a decrease in @xmath47 ) .",
    "besides , figure 7a manifestly shows that [ o / h ] and [ fe / h ] are anti - correlated with each other in the sense that [ o / h ] gets decreased from @xmath89 to @xmath90 as [ fe / h ] increases from @xmath89 to @xmath3 .",
    "since these tendencies are qualitatively the same as seen in sharp - lined a - type stars showing am phenomenon ( takeda & sadakane 1997 , takeda et al .",
    "2008 , paper  i ) , we may state that o and fe abundances of these sharp - lined late b - type stars ( 10000  k  @xmath0  k ) can be regarded as peculiarity indicators ( weakly dependent upon @xmath47 , behaving in an opposite way to each other ) just as has been reported for a - type stars ( 7000  k  @xmath8  k ) .",
    "note that this consequence is consistent with the results of takeda et al .",
    "( 1999 ; cf . figures 10 and 11 therein )    now , we are almost ready to answer the question which originally motivated this investigation : `` does [ na / h ] scale with [ fe / h ] in accordance with the extent of peculiarity in these late b stars , just as seen in a stars ? ''",
    "our answer is negative according to figure 7b , which reveals that [ na / h ] values are roughly homogeneous distributing at a mildly subsolar level between @xmath91 and @xmath89 ( the average is @xmath92[na / h]@xmath93 with @xmath94 , where the outlier value of [ na / h ] = + 0.59 for hd  143807  crb ) , being very sharp - lined with almost the lowest @xmath86 ( 4  km  s@xmath12 ) , belongs to the low @xmath5 group of near a0 ( 10828  k ) . reflecting its conspicuously strong and saturated @xmath60 ( 116  m@xmath15 ) , the na abundance of this star is especially sensitive to errors in @xmath5 as well as @xmath38 , as manifestly seen in figures 5d and 5f .",
    "accordingly , we have to keep in mind that the na abundance derived for this star is less reliable compared to other stars , which might explain ( at least partly ) this outlier nature . ]",
    "is excluded ) without any significant dependence on [ fe / h ] ( showing a large dispersion from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ) . yet ,",
    "if we confine to stars with 10000  k  @xmath95  k ( red circles in figure 7b ) , we still see a sign of weak positive correlation between [ na / h ] and [ fe / h ] , presumably because they tend to share the characteristics of a0-type stars .",
    "however , as @xmath5 becomes higher , this trend eventually disappears at @xmath96  k ( blue triangles ) where [ na / h ] tends to be stabilized with only a small dispersion around [ na / h ]  @xmath97 .",
    "hence , we may state that whether and how na correlate with fe in upper main - sequence stars depends significantly on @xmath5 .",
    "let us investigate this issue in a more quantitative manner . combining the present results with those of our previous studies ( takeda 2007 ; paper  ii )",
    ", we display in figure 8 the [ na / h ] vs. [ fe / h ] relations for four stellar groups of different @xmath5 ranges ( fgk - type stars , a - type stars , late b - type stars of near a0 , and late b - type stars ) , and the statistical quantities showing the nature of correlation between these two elements were also computed for each group as given in table 3 .",
    "we can recognize from this table ( and intuitively confirmed from figure 8) that the slope ( @xmath99 ) of linear - regression relation ( [ na / h ] @xmath100 [ fe / h ] + @xmath101 ) progressively decreases while the dispersion increases as @xmath5 becomes higher , which is an interesting tendency .",
    "it should be remarked , however , that the characteristics of fgk stars ( first group ) and those of a  b stars ( last three groups ) are intrinsically different from each other .    regarding the former late - type stars in the galactic disk ( @xmath6  11.5  @xmath43 ) which have ages of @xmath102@xmath103  yr , the reason for the spread of @xmath104  dex in [ fe / h ] as well as [ na / h ] is due to the chemical evolution in our galaxy . and the scaling relation of [ na / h ]  @xmath6  [ fe / h ] may be interpreted by the fact that the synthesis of na ( odd - z neutron - rich element ) is sensitive to neutron excess and thus considered to be metallicity - dependent .",
    "actually , [ na / fe]@xmath45 almost holds for disk stars of @xmath105  [ fe / h ]  @xmath10 , though a slight upturn is observed at the metal - rich end ( @xmath106  [ fe / h ]  @xmath107 ) ( see , e.g. , takeda et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "in contrast , early - type stars with masses of @xmath6  1.55  @xmath43 are considerably younger ( @xmath108@xmath109  yr ) , which are regarded to have formed from gas of nearly the same chemical composition .",
    "( see , e.g. , the near - homogeneity of o and ne abundances in b - type stars derived by takeda et al .",
    "accordingly , the diversified na as well as fe abundances in these sharp - lined a and late - b stars ( @xmath110  700014000  k ) must be due to `` abundance peculiarities '' which were acquired during their main - sequence life time presumably due to chemical segregation processes operating in the stable atmosphere or envelope .",
    "the significance of the result we found is , therefore , that it can provide with important observational characteristics of chemical peculiarities in a and late - b stars to be explained theoretically , e.g. , by atomic diffusion calculations .",
    "regarding our primary aim of this investigation ( i.e. , to check whether or not the trend of na vs. fe correlation seen a - type stars persists into the regime of late b - type stars ) , our conclusion is summarized as follows : +  ( 1 ) in the regime of a - type stars ( 7000  k  @xmath8  k ) , the mechanism causing chemical peculiarities ( mainly am anomalies in this case , characterized by overabundance of fe and underabundance of o ) acts nearly equally on both na and fe , so that a near - scaling relation between [ na / h ] and [ fe / h ] ( [ na / h ]  @xmath111  [ fe / h ] ) is realized despite that these two elements have suffered appreciable abundance changes . + ",
    "( 2 ) however , as @xmath5 is increased ( higher than 10000  k ) , this relation first becomes appreciably loosened and ambiguous at the transition region ( 10000  k  @xmath112  11000  k ) , then the correlation eventually disappears at 11000  k  @xmath112",
    "14000  k where [ na / h ] stabilizes almost at the primordial value  k. as a matter of fact , we are not certain whether the slightly subsolar tendency in [ na / h ] ( by @xmath6  0.2  dex on the average ) is really meaningful , considering the possibility that our @xmath5 scale might as well be systematically raised by @xmath21  k ( cf . footnote 3 ) . ] , despite both o and fe still show @xmath47-dependent anomalies .",
    "this suggests that the physical process causing abundance peculiarities does not work any more on na at this higher-@xmath113 regime of late b - type stars , though it still operates on both fe and o ( typically exhibited by hgmn stars ) .",
    "+  ( 3 ) it is interesting to note that the `` transition region '' stars at 10000  k  @xmath112  11000  k are in the mass range of 2.53  @xmath43 ( cf .",
    "figure 1 ) , which just correspond to the region on the hr diagram occupied by both hgmn stars and hot am stars nearly overlapped as pointed out by adelman et al .",
    "( 2003 ; cf .",
    "figure 1 therein ) .",
    "we may state that these two groups of non - magnetic chemically peculiar stars ( am stars and hgmn stars ) could be roughly characterized by the existence of na  fe correlation ( i.e. , both elements undergo abundance peculiarities in a similar manner ) and the absence of such connection ( i.e. , fe suffers anomaly while na do not ) , respectively .",
    "this consequence may serve as an important observational constraint for understanding the mechanism producing abundance peculiarities in upper main - sequence stars .",
    "generally , less attention seems to have been paid to na in early - type chemically peculiar stars , presumably because published observational data have been insufficient .",
    "above all , diffusion calculations for na in the envelope of b - type stars with @xmath114 seem to have been rarely conducted so far , except for the old work ( e.g. , michaud et al .",
    "1976 ) . in this respect ,",
    "new contributions by theoreticians are desirably expected toward reasonably explaining the observational trend for na ( along with o and fe ) confirmed in this investigation .",
