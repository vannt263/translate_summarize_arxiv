    "indirect measurements use interaction between monitored ( target ) and ancillary ( pointer ) system followed by projection measurement on ancilla .",
    "this gives the wide opportunity in realizing indirect ( and unsharp ) detection process with weak disturbance of initial state of the target .",

    "this technique were successfully applied in @xcite to describe stern - gerlah experiment with unsharp measurement .",
    "another way is to start from the arbitrary suitable pointer and comparatively simple interaction and construct positive operator valued measures ( povm ) corresponding to this kind of generalized detection .",

    "the second one is influence of environment , which may appears in initially entangled state with the pointer and/or pointer state decoherentization during it s interaction with measured system .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the conditional evolution of the monitored system in the case of interaction between pointer and environment during measurement process .",
