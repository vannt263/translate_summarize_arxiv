    "<S> highly - excited single - particle states in nuclei are coupled with the excitations of a more complex character , first of all with collective phonon - like modes of the core . in the framework of the quasiparticle - phonon model we consider the structure of resulting complex configurations using the @xmath0 orbital in @xmath1pb as an example . </S>",
    "<S> although , on the level of one- and two - phonon admixtures , the fully chaotic goe regime is not reached , the eigenstates of the model carry significant degree of complexity that can be quantified with the aid of correlational invariant entropy . </S>",
    "<S> with artificially enhanced particle - core coupling , the system undergoes the doubling phase transition with the quasiparticle strength concentrated in two repelling peaks . </S>",
    "<S> this phase transition is clearly detected by correlational entropy . </S>"
