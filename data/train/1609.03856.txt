    "in the present paper the szeged index and the wiener index of partial cubes are investigated .",
    "our main result extends a parallel result about the szeged index of benzenoid systems @xcite to all partial cubes . in @xcite",
    "the corresponding indices were expressed as the sum of indices of three weighted quotient trees , while in the general case these trees are quotient graphs of a partial cube with respect to a partition coarser than @xmath0-partition .",
    "partial cubes constitute a large class of graphs with a lot of applications and includes , for example , many families of chemical graphs ( benzenoid systems , trees , @xmath1 systems , phenylenes , cyclic phenylenes , polyphenylenes ) .",
    "therefore , our results can be used to calculate the indices of a particular family of chemical graphs in linear time .    the wiener index and the szeged index",
    "are some of the most commonly studied topological indices .",
    "their history goes back to @xmath2 , when h. wiener used the distances in the molecular graphs of alkanes to calculate their boiling points @xcite .",
    "this research has led to the wiener index , which is defined as @xmath3    in that paper it was also noticed that for every tree @xmath4 it holds @xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes the number of vertices of @xmath4 whose distance to @xmath7 is smaller than the distance to @xmath8 and @xmath9 denotes the number of vertices of @xmath4 whose distance to @xmath8 is smaller than the distance to @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , a proper generalization to any graph was defined in @xcite as    @xmath10 this topological index was later named as the szeged index .",
    "for some recent results on the wiener index and the szeged index see @xcite .",
    "the wiener index , due to its correlation with a large number of physico - chemical properties of organic molecules and its interesting mathematical properties , has been extensively studied in both theoretical and chemical literature .",
    "later , the szeged index was introduced and it was shown that it also has many applications , for example in drug modelling @xcite and in networks @xcite .",
    "the paper reads as follows . in the next section",
    "we give some basic definitions needed later . in section",
    "[ main ] we prove that the problem of calculating the szeged index of a partial cube can be reduced to the problem of calculating the szeged indices of weighted quotient graphs with respect to a partition coarser than @xmath0-partition .",
    "it turns out that such quotient graphs are again partial cubes .",
    "we also consider a similar result for the wiener index , which was proved in @xcite under the name partition distance . in section [ uporaba ]",
    "we show that the mentioned results generalize already known results for benzenoid systems ( see @xcite ) and apply them to @xmath1 systems .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate with an example that the method can also be used to calculate the corresponding indices by hand .",
    "the _ distance _ @xmath11 between vertices @xmath12 and @xmath13 of a graph @xmath14 is the length of a shortest path between vertices @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath14 . we also write @xmath15 for @xmath11 .",
    "two edges @xmath16 and @xmath17 of graph @xmath14 are in relation @xmath0 , @xmath18 , if @xmath19 note that this relation is also known as djokovi ' c - winkler relation .",
    "the relation @xmath0 is reflexive and symmetric , but not necessarily transitive .",
    "we denote its transitive closure ( i.e.  the smallest transitive relation containing @xmath0 ) by @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the @xmath20-partition of the set @xmath22 .",
    "then we say that a partition @xmath23 of @xmath22 is _ coarser _ than @xmath24 if each set @xmath25 is the union of one or more @xmath20-classes of @xmath14 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the _ hypercube _ @xmath26 of dimension @xmath27 is defined in the following way : all vertices of @xmath26 are presented as @xmath27-tuples @xmath28 where @xmath29 for each @xmath30 and two vertices of @xmath26 are adjacent if the corresponding @xmath27-tuples differ in precisely one coordinate . therefore , the _ hamming distance _ between two tuples @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the number of positions in @xmath12 and @xmath13 in which they differ .    a subgraph @xmath31 of @xmath14 is called an",

    "in this section we prove the main result of the paper .",

    ", the proof for the szeged index follows obviously",
    ".    the above proposition can be useful for deriving closed formulas for some families of graphs .",
    "but since the number of @xmath0-classes of a partial cube can be very large , in the rest of this section we generalize this result such that the computation is possible for any partition of @xmath22 coarser than @xmath0-partition . as a consequence",
    ", the calculation of these two indices will be much more efficient . to prove the main theorem ,",
    "some preparation is needed .",
    "the following lemma claims that every quotient graph obtained from a partition coarser than @xmath0-partition is again a partial cube .",

    "every edge @xmath114 represents @xmath115 edges of @xmath98 .",
    "also , any edge @xmath116 is represented by some edge @xmath114 , since each edge of @xmath14 is in exactly one @xmath0-class of @xmath14 .",

    "we also consider the wiener index of partial cubes .",
    "this problem was solved in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.3 ) , where it was proved that the partition distance of a connected ( weighted ) graph can be expressed as the sum of the wiener indices of weighted quotient graphs with respect to a partition coarser than @xmath20-partition .",
    "in a special case , the partition distance is the wiener index . since for the partial cubes it holds @xmath43 , we get the following result .",
    "@xcite [ wini ] let @xmath14 be a partial cube .",
    "if @xmath23 is a partition coarser than the @xmath0-partition , then @xmath128",
    "the results proven in section [ main ] are already well - known for benzenoid systems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since each benzenoid system is a partial cube , these well - known results also follows directly from the results from section 3 .",
    "therefore , in this section we will concentrate to the @xmath1 systems .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath1 systems we show that the wiener index and szeget index can be computed in linear time .",
    "let @xmath129 be the infinite @xmath1 net and let @xmath130 be a cycle in it .",
    "then a @xmath1 _ system _ is induced by the vertices and edges of @xmath129 , lying on @xmath130 and in its interior . obviously , any @xmath1 system is a bipartite graph , since the whole @xmath1 net is bipartite .",
    "@xmath1 systems are important in chemical graph theory , since they are subgraphs of @xmath131 and @xmath132 nanotubes and nanotori , which are some of the central and most commonly studied families of chemical graphs ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "also , the infinite version of a @xmath1 system was considered in @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xmath1 systems can represent chemical compounds , formed by the rings of cyclobutane and cyclooctane . in the next theorem",
    "we show that each @xmath1 system is a partial cube .",
    "let @xmath14 be a @xmath1 system .",
    "two edges of an internal face of @xmath14 are in relation @xmath0 if they are antipodal .",
    "if the edge @xmath133 is contained in two different internal faces @xmath134 and @xmath135 , then @xmath136 is in relation @xmath0 with two different antipodal edges @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are also in relation @xmath0 and therefore , @xmath136 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 are all in relation @xmath0 . again ,",
    "if @xmath139 ( or @xmath140 ) is contained in two different internal faces , then we obtain the edge @xmath141 which is in relation @xmath0 with edges @xmath136 , @xmath139 , and @xmath140 .      without loss of generality",
    "we assume that @xmath142 , where @xmath27 is a positive integer , is a maximal set of edges obtained as above .",
    "obviously , @xmath143 is not connected .",
    "moreover , it contains exactly two connected component , namely @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "clearly , these components are convex subgraphs of @xmath14 .",

    "our next goal is to prove that the wiener index and the szeged of a @xmath1 system can be computed in @xmath158 time .",

    "this can be done in linear time .",
    "next we visit all the vertices of @xmath4 according to this labelling ( we start with the smallest label ) .",
    "furthermore , for every vertex @xmath13 , we will adopt weights @xmath163 and calculate new weights @xmath164 .",
