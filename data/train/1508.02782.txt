    "in the past decade , quantum - chemical studies prove helpful in understanding and predicting chemical phenomena of small and medium - sized molecules  @xcite .",
    "routine applications to larger molecular systems are , however , hampered as conventional quantum chemistry methods are either too expensive or too approximate to guarantee reliable results .",
    "these problems are particularly severe for molecules where strong electron correlation becomes important .",
    "examples for strongly - correlated systems are , for instance , radicals , transition metals , and actinide compounds . furthermore ,",
    "well - established approaches for strong correlation scale poorly , often factorially , with system size .",
    "these drawbacks motivate the development of new , unconventional electron correlation methods for strongly - correlated many - body systems that represent computationally cheaper alternatives to standard methods .",
    "one active field of research for strongly - correlated systems focuses on the development of wavefunction methods that use two - electron functions ( geminals ) to model the correlated motion of electrons  @xcite .",
    "the most popular geminal - based approaches are the antisymmetric product of strongly orthogonal geminals  @xcite ( apsg ) , the antisymmetrized geminal power  @xcite ( which is a special case of projected hartree  fock ",
    "bogoliubov  @xcite ) , the antisymmetric product of interacting geminals  @xcite ( apig ) , generalized valence bond  @xcite ( gvb ) , and the antisymmetric product of 1-reference orbital geminals ( ap1rog )  @xcite .",
    "specifically , ap1rog provides a very good approximation to the doubly occupied configuration interaction  @xcite ( doci ) wavefunction , at mean - field computational cost .",
    "the ap1rog geminal creation operator reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 are the standard fermionic creation operators for spin - up ( @xmath6 ) and spin - down electrons ( @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 are the geminal coefficients , and the summation runs over all virtual orbitals . specifically , the ap1rog geminal coefficient matrix has the form @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the number of basis functions , @xmath11 the number of electron pairs , and the left sub - block of @xmath12 entails some reference determinant .",
    "the geminal matrix connects each geminal with the underlying one - particle basis functions .",
    "we should note that if we impose specific restrictions on the structure of the above matrix , we can deduce different geminal models  @xcite .",
    "the electronic wavefunction is written as a product of geminal creation operators for all electron pairs @xmath11 acting on the vacuum state , @xmath13 .",
    "unique among geminal methods , the ap1rog wavefunction ansatz can be rewritten in terms of one - particle functions as a fully general pair - coupled - cluster - doubles  @xcite ( pccd ) wavefunction , @xmath14 is some independent - particle wavefunction ( for instance the hartree  fock ( hf ) determinant ) .",
    "the exponential ansatz of ap1rog ( _ cf_.  eq .  ) ensures size - extensivity of the model .",
    "however , to recover size - consistency , we have to optimize the one - particle basis functions",
    ". this can be done in a fully variational manner  @xcite , analogous to orbital - optimized coupled cluster  @xcite , or using non - variational orbital optimization techniques  @xcite .",
    "a number of numerical studies on systems with strongly correlated electrons showed the superiority of the variational orbital optimization procedure over the latter ones  @xcite .",
    "we should note that due to the four - index transformation of the electron repulsion integrals , the computational scaling of the orbital - optimized ap1rog model deteriorates to @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "although restricted orbital - optimized ap1rog is limited to close - shell systems , it has already proven to be a reliable method for modeling strong electron correlation effects in quasi - degenerate systems  @xcite , single and multiple bond - breaking processes  @xcite , and actinide chemistry  @xcite .    as all other geminal models , ap1rog misses a large fraction of weak ( dynamical ) electron correlation effects . to address this problem and account for weak electron correlation effects in the geminal reference wavefunction , various _ a posteriori _ corrections",
    "have been proposed .",
    "these include models based on single- and multi - reference perturbation theory  @xcite , extended random phase approximation  @xcite , ( linearized ) coupled cluster theory  @xcite , and density functional theory  @xcite . in the case of ap1rog ,",
    "dynamical correlation was included using perturbation theory  @xcite and density functional theory  @xcite .",
    "recent studies on diatomic molecules , however , point out numerical instabilities and failures of the proposed perturbation theory corrections  @xcite .",
    "this motivates the development of different , ideally more robust dynamical correlation models for ap1rog . a reliable way to account for dynamical correlation effects _",
    "a posteriori _ is to use a multi - reference linearized coupled cluster ( lcc ) correction .",
    "recently , zoboki _ et al .",
    "_ presented an lcc correction based on an apsg reference function and demonstrated the good performance of the apsg - mrlcc approach .",
    "their findings encouraged us to develop an lcc correction based on an ap1rog reference state .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : lcc ] , we will discuss two different lcc corrections for ap1rog .",
    "their performance is compared by studying some well - known problems in quantum chemistry that require a balanced treatment of dynamical and strong electron correlation effects : the dissociation of c@xmath0 and f@xmath0 , the symmetric dissociation of h@xmath2 , and spectroscopic constants of the uo@xmath1 molecule .",
    "computational details are presented in section  [ sec : comp ] , while numerical results are discussed in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in this work , dynamical correlation effects are built in the electronic wavefunction _ a posteriori _ using an exponential coupled cluster ansatz , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a general cluster operator .",
    "the corresponding time - independent schrdinger equation reads @xmath18    multiplying from the left by @xmath19 and truncating the baker  campbell ",

    "the projection manifold @xmath28 will depend on the choice of the cluster operator @xmath29 ( vide infra ) .",
    "the energy can be calculated by projecting against the reference determinant of @xmath26 , _",
    "i.e. _ , multiplying eq .   by @xmath30 and using intermediate normalization , @xmath31 ) \\vert { \\rm ap1rog } \\rangle = e.\\ ] ]    the only constraint on the cluster operator we have made so far",
    "is that it creates states that are orthogonal to the ap1rog reference function . a possible choice for the cluster operator that ensures this orthogonality condition is to include substitutions between the occupied and virtual orbitals with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "if only double excitations are included , the cluster operator is specified as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the singlet excitation operator and the cluster amplitudes are symmetric with respect to pair - exchange , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath34 . the prime in the above summations indicates that pair - excited determinants are excluded in the cluster operator , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath35 ( as those excitations do not fulfill the orthogonality condition , @xmath27 ) .    to arrive at a computationally feasible model , we will further restrict the cluster operator of eq .   to allow for excitations with respect to the reference determinant only .",
    "thereby , we exclude possible redundancies in excitations and amplitudes .",
    "the projection manifold then contains all doubly - excited determinants with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "furthermore , as basis for the bra states of the projection manifold , we will use the convenient choice @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "the bra basis then forms a biorthogonal basis which satisfy the normalization condition @xmath39    the doubles amplitudes @xmath40 are obtained by solving a linear set of equations @xmath41 where the sum runs over all double excitations ( without pair excitations ) and @xmath42 , while @xmath43 \\vert { \\rm ap1rog } \\rangle$ ] .",
    "the energy correction @xmath44 with respect to the ap1rog reference wavefunction is given as @xmath45 where we have used the standard notation for the exchange intergrals , @xmath46 , and physicists notation for the two - electron integrals .    similarly , the contribution of single excitations can be accounted for by including @xmath47 in the cluster operator . restricting the single excitations to the ap1rog reference determinant @xmath36 , the singles projection manifold contains all singly - excited determinants with respect to @xmath36 . in analogy to the doubles projection manifold , the bra states of the singles projection manifold are chosen to form a biorthogonal basis with the convenient normalization condition @xmath48 where @xmath49",
    ". the single and double amplitudes are obtained by solving a coupled set of linear equations equivalent to eq .   where @xmath50 and @xmath51 now run over all single and double excitations .",
    "the energy correction with respect to the ap1rog reference value is as follows @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the elements of the fock matrix , @xmath54 and @xmath55 are the one - electron integrals .",
    "note that , in contrast to canonical hartree ",
    "fock orbitals , the fock matrix is not diagonal when the orbitals are optimized within ap1rog . in the ap1rog - lcc approach , the single excitations thus contribute both directly to the energy correction and indirectly through coupling to the doubles equations .",
    "we will abbreviate the lcc correction using @xmath56 as ap1rog - lccd , while ap1rog - lccsd indicates that the cluster operator contains single and double excitations , @xmath57 .",
    "all geminal calculations have been performed in the horton 2.0.0 software package  @xcite .",
    "all restricted ( variationally ) orbital - optimized ap1rog calculations were allowed to freely relax without any spatial symmetry constraints , _",

    "the cc - pvdz basis set of dunning was employed , ( 10s5p1d ) @xmath58 [ 4s3p1d ] .",
    "the potential energy curves of diatomic molecules were obtained by varying bond lengths in a range of @xmath59   and @xmath60    for the f@xmath0 and c@xmath0 molecules , respectively .",
    "the points on the resulting potential energy curve were used for a subsequent generalized morse function  @xcite fit to obtain the equilibrium bond lengths ( r@xmath61 ) and potential energy depths ( d@xmath61 ) .",

    "adding dynamical correlation effects on top of ap1rog shifts @xmath64 closer to ccsd(t ) reference data .",
    "the shape of the potential , however , strongly depends on the ap1rog dynamical correlation model .",
    "specifically , ptb results in a much steeper potential energy surface overestimating vibrational frequencies by more than 330 @xmath65 compared to ccsd(t ) , while lccd preserves the shape of the potential energy surface and yields a vibrational frequency that agrees well with ap1rog and ccsd(t ) data ( differences amount to ca .",

    "furthermore , the casscf equilibrium distance strongly depends on the size of the active space chosen in casscf calculations . specifically , increasing the active space from cas(10,10 ) to cas(12,12 ) , _ i.e. _ , including the @xmath66- and @xmath67-orbitals , results in spectroscopic constants that are in good agreement with ap1rog - lccd and ccsd(t ) data .",
    "figure  [ fig : uo2 ] shows the fitted potential energy surfaces around the equilibrium for selected quantum chemistry methods .",
    "ap1rog - lccd yields total electronic energies that are between ccsd and ccsd(t ) , while the potential energy surface predicted by ap1rog - ptb is considerably lower than the ccsd(t ) reference curve .",

    "our approach is motivated by previous studies of an lcc correction to an apsg reference function  @xcite .",
    "specifically , our cluster operator is restricted to doubles and singles and doubles excitations as in the standard coupled cluster approach , _",
    "i.e. _ , excitations from the occupied to the virtual orbitals of some reference determinant .",
    "we have compared this new dynamical correlation ansatz to the pta and ptb perturbation theory models as well as standard quantum chemistry approaches for the c@xmath0 and f@xmath0 molecules , the h@xmath2 hydrogen chain , and the uranyl cation , uo@xmath1 .    in general ,",
    "both ap1rog - lcc models yield similar spectroscopic constants and are closest to mrci - sd , ccsd(t ) , and dmrg reference data for all molecules we have investigated .",
    "furthermore , lccd and lccsd represent more robust and reliable dynamical correlation models than pta and ptb .",
    "our study demonstrates that the success and failures of pta and ptb are difficult to anticipate a priori and are strongly system - dependent . while pta yields reasonable results for equilibrium bond lengths of the c@xmath0 molecule and for the potential energy depth of the f@xmath0 molecule , the corresponding c@xmath0 potential energy depth and the f@xmath0 equilibrium bond length significantly differ from reference data .",

    "<S> we present a linearized coupled cluster ( lcc ) correction based on an antisymmetric product of 1 reference orbital geminals ( ap1rog ) reference state . in our lcc ansatz , </S>",
    "<S> the cluster operator is restricted to double and to single and double excitations as in standard single - reference cc theory . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the ap1rog - lcc models is tested for the dissociation of diatomic molecules ( c@xmath0 and f@xmath0 ) , spectroscopic constants of the uranyl cation ( uo@xmath1 ) , and the symmetric dissociation of the h@xmath2 hydrogen chain . </S>",
    "<S> our study indicates that an lcc correction based on an ap1rog reference function is more robust and reliable than corrections based on perturbation theory , yielding spectroscopic constants that are in very good agreement with theoretical reference data . </S>"
