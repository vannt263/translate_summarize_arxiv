    "in 1898 , heegaard @xcite introduced a heegaard splitting for a closed , orientable , triangulated 3-manifold , i.e. , there is a closed , orientable surface cutting this manifold into two handlebodies . later , moise @xcite proved that every closed , orientable 3-manifold admits a triangulation .",
    "so each closed orientable 3-manifold admits a heegaard splitting .",
    "this makes studying 3-manifolds through heegaard splittings possible .",
    "one astonishing result proved by haken @xcite is that if all heegaard splitting of a 3-manifold are reducible , i.e. , there is an essential simple closed curve in heegaard surface bounding essential disks on both sides , then this manifold is reducible .",
    "later , casson and gordon @xcite defined a weakly reducible heegaard splitting and proved that if a 3-manifold has a weakly reducible and irreducible heegaard splitting , then it contains an embedded closed incompressible surface , i.e. , it is haken .",
    "both of these two phenomenons drive people to think how heegaard splittings reflect 3-manifolds .    for classifying 3-manifolds ,",
    "thurston @xcite introduced the geometrization conjecture ( haken version proved by thurston @xcite and full version proved by perelman @xcite ) as follows : for any closed , irreducible , orientable 3-manifold , there are finitely many disjoint , non isotopy essential tori so that after cutting the manifold along those tori , each piece is one of eight geometries . among all of these eight geometries ,",
    "one is hyperbolic , another one is solvable and the left six pieces are seifert . in these eight geometries",
    ", it is known that seifert 3-manifolds have been completely classified .",
    "moreover all of their irreducible heegaard splittings are either vertical or horizontal , see @xcite .",
    "cooper and scharlemann @xcite studied all irreducible heegaard splittings of a solvmanifold . and",
    "there are series of works on heegaard splittings of some typical 3-manifolds , such as lens space , surface @xmath0 etc .",
    "with the curve complex defined by harvey @xcite , hempel @xcite introduced an index - heegaard distance for studying heegaard splitting .",
    "basically , this index- heegaard distance is defined to be the length of a shortest geodesic in curve complex which connects these two boundaries of essential disks from different sides .",
    "then he proved that all heegaard splittings of a seifert 3-manifold have distance at most two ; if a 3-manifold contains an essential torus , then all heegaard splittings of it have distance at most two , where this result is also proved by hartshorn @xcite and scharlemann @xcite . combined with the geometrization conjecture , if a 3-manifold admits a heegaard splitting with heegaard distance at least three , then it is hyperbolic .",
    "so it seems that if we fully understand all of distance two heegaard splittings , then we can fully answer the question that how heegaard splittings reflect 3-manifolds .",
    "so this question is reduced to    what dose a 3-manifold look like if it only admits distance at most two heegaard splittings ?",
    "[ ques:1 ]    since the hyperbolic 3-manifolds are the most concerned , given a distance two heegaard splitting , it is interesting to know whether the corresponding manifold is hyperbolic or not .    by the definition of a distance two heegaard splitting",
    ", there is an essential simple closed curve and a pair of essential disks from different handlebodies so that this curve is disjoint from those two essential disks boundaries .",
    "it seems that this heegaard splitting is simple and hence whether the manifold is hyperbolic or not should not be hard to answer .",
    "however , things for distance two heegaard splittings are complicated because there are examples showing that a 3-manifold admitting a distance two heegaard splitting could be seifert , hyperbolic or contains an essential torus , see @xcite .",
    "thompson @xcite studied all distance two genus two heegaard splittings and found that even for genus two heegaard splittings , those manifolds could be very complicated .",
    "later , rubinstein and thompson @xcite extended this result to genus at least three cases .",
    "but their results give no sufficient conditions to determine whether it is hyperbolic or not .    according to geometrization conjecture , except small seifert 3-manifolds and hyperbolic 3-manifolds ,",
    "all of 3-manifolds contain essential tori .",
    "it is known that the heegaard splittings of small seifert 3-manifolds are well understood .",
    "so to answer the question [ ques:1 ] , the first step is to understand possible essential tori in a 3-manifold .    in @xcite , the authors studied the curve complex and introduced the definition of a locally large geodesic .",
    "then they constructed infinitely many arbitrary large distance heegaard splitting . in the proof of theorem 1.3 in @xcite",
    ", they found that the locally large property of geodesics forces any geodesic realizing heegaard distance to share some vertex @xmath1 in common .",
    "so if the resulted manifold contains an essential torus @xmath2 , then @xmath2 intersects this heegaard surface in some essential simple closed curves , which are all isotopic to @xmath1 .",
    "thus @xmath2 intersects that heegaard surface in fixed essential simple closed curves . under this circumstance",
    ", it seems the corresponding 3-manifold is not hard to understand . for this reason",
    ", we introduce the definition of a locally large distance two heegaard splitting .    a length two geodesic realizing heegaard distance is @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 bound essential disks from two sides of the heegaard surface and @xmath1 is disjoint from both @xmath4 and @xmath5 . as we know , there is a length two geodesic contains a non separating essential simple closed curve as its middle vertex realizing heegaard distance .",
    "so we assume that @xmath1 is represented by a non separating essential simple closed curve .",
    "let @xmath6 be this heegaard surface .",
    "we say the geodesic @xmath7 is locally large if for the surface @xmath8 , @xmath9 , for any pair of @xmath10 and @xmath11 disjoint from @xmath1 , where both @xmath10 and @xmath11 bound essential disks in different sides of @xmath6 respectively .",
    "moreover , by the definition of a locally large geodesic , we say a heegaard splitting is locally large if there is a locally large geodesic realizing heegaard distance .",
    "the main result is    if a closed orientable manifold @xmath12 admits a locally large distance two heegaard splitting @xmath13 , then @xmath12 is a hyperbolic manifolds or an amalgamation of a hyperbolic manifold and a small seifert manifolds along an incompressible torus .",
    "moreover there is only one essential torus in the non - hyperbolic case up to isotopy .",
    "[ thm1 ]    a 3-manifold is almost hyperbolic if either it is hyperbolic or it is an amalgamation of a hyperbolic 3-manifold and a small non hyperbolic 3-manifold along an incompressible torus",
    ". then the conclusion of theorem [ thm1 ] says that    a 3-manifold admitting a locally large distance two heegaard splitting is almost hyperbolic .",
    "the geometrization conjecture indicates that    \\(1 ) a seifert 3-manifold does not admits a complete hyperbolic structure ;    \\(2 ) a solvmanifold does not admits a complete hyperbolic structure ;    \\(3 ) an amalgamation of a complete hyperbolic 3-manifold and a small seifert 3-manifold along a torus is not one of those eight geometries , see @xcite .",
    "thus combined with the result of theorem [ thm1 ] ,    neither a solvmanifold nor a seifert 3-manifold admits a locally large distance two heegaard splitting .    according to geometrization conjecture ,",
    "the most important piece of those eight geometries is hyperbolic . thus giving a sufficient condition for a hyperbolic 3-manifold is critical in studying heegaard splittings .",
    "but the example in section [ sec3 ] shows that the manifold @xmath12 in theorem [ thm1 ] could be a non hyperbolic manifold .",
    "so to give a sufficient condition for a hyperbolic 3-manifold , we need to eliminate the possible essential torus in theorem [ thm1 ] . for this purpose ,",
    "we introduce some definitions .",
    "an essential simple closed curve in heegaard surface is a co - core for a handlebody if there is an essential disk in this handlebody so that its boundary intersects this curve in one point .",
    "the definition of a domain for an essential simple closed curve is in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] implies that under the locally large condition of @xmath1 , the non hyperbolic case happens if two copies of @xmath1 bounds essential tori in both sides of @xmath6 and @xmath1 is not co - core on either side of @xmath6 .",
    "so ,    suppose that a closed orientable manifold @xmath12 has a locally large distance two heegaard splitting @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath1 be an essential simple closed curve disjoint from a pair of essential disks from different sides of @xmath6 .",
    "then @xmath12 is hyperbolic if and only if either all domains of @xmath1 have euler characteristic number less than -1 or @xmath1 is co - core for one side of @xmath6 .",
    "[ thm2 ]    we introduce the definition of a geodesic of curve complex in section [ sec2 ] , construct a non hyperbolic 3-manifold in section [ sec3 ] and prove theorem [ thm1 ] and [ thm2 ] in section [ sec4 ] and [ sec5 ] .",
    "* acknowledgements .",
    "* the authors would like to thank tao li for careful checking the earlier version of this manuscript , pointing out the genus two case of theorem [ thm1 ] and many helpful conversations .",
    "let @xmath6 be a compact surface of genus at least 1 , and @xmath14 be the curve complex of @xmath6 .",
    "we call a simple closed curve @xmath15 in @xmath6 is essential if @xmath15 bounds no disk in @xmath6 and is not parallel to @xmath16",

    ", we do not distinguish the essential simple closed curve @xmath15 and its isotopy class @xmath15 without any further notation .",

    "for any two vertices @xmath21 and @xmath22 of @xmath18 , the distance of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , denoted by @xmath23 , is defined to be the minimal number of 1-simplexes in a simplicial path joining x to y. in other words , @xmath24 is the smallest integer @xmath25 such that there is a sequence of vertices @xmath26 such that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are represented by two disjoint essential simple closed curves on @xmath6 for each @xmath29 .",

    "there is a shortest path in @xmath45 connecting any two vertices of @xmath17 .",
    "thus for any two distance @xmath44 vertices @xmath4 and @xmath46 , a geodesic @xmath7 connects @xmath4 and @xmath46 if @xmath47 . now for any two sub - simplicial complex @xmath48 , a geodesic @xmath7 realizing the distance of @xmath30 and @xmath31 if @xmath7 connects an element @xmath49 and an element @xmath50 so that @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 be a compact surface of genus at least 1 with non - empty boundary .",
    "similar to the definition of the curve complex @xmath53 , we can define the arc and curve complex @xmath54 as follows :    each vertex of @xmath54 is the isotopy class of an essential simple closed curve or an essential properly embedded arc in @xmath52 , and a set of vertices form a simplex of @xmath54 if these vertices are represented by pairwise disjoint arcs or curves in @xmath52 . for any two disjoint vertices , we place an edge between them .",
    "all the vertices and edges form 1-skeleton of @xmath54 , denoted by @xmath55 . and for each edge , we assign it length 1 .",

    "<S> from the view of heegaard splitting , it is known that if a closed orientable 3-manifold admits a distance at least three heegaard splitting , then it is hyperbolic . however , for a closed orientable 3-manifold admitting only distance at most two heegaard splittings , there are examples showing that it could be reducible , seifert , toroidal or hyperbolic . according to thurston s geometrization conjecture , the most important piece in eight geometries is hyperbolic . </S>",
