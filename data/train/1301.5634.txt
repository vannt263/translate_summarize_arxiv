    "many interesting novel electronic materials , including charge - transfer solids and conducting polymers , are quasi - one - dimensional physical systems and exhibit clear effects of both electron - phonon ( e - ph ) and electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions .",
    "accordingly , a large number of one dimensional ( 1d ) hamiltonians have been studied as microscopic models for these systems , with considerable success in describing the range of ground states , nonlinear excitations , and optical and transport properties of these materials .",
    "one outstanding challenge for theorists has remained , however : namely , the identification of a 1d model , incorporating both electron - phonon and electron - electron interactions with _ realistic _",
    "interaction parameters that exhibits dominant superconducting fluctuations .",
    "this has proven especially difficult because of the strong tendency in these 1d systems to form insulating density waves ground states : charge density wave ( cdw ) , spin density wave ( sdw ) , or bond - order wave ( bow ) .",
    "hence the recent suggestion @xcite that the 1d holstein - hubbard ( hh ) model at half - filling might have , for a narrow window of parameters , a region of dominant superconducting fluctuations has generated considerable interest . although some later analyses @xcite suggest that this model likely does not have _ dominant _ superconducting fluctuations , the initial results @xcite provided support for the existence of a novel gapless metallic phase intermediate between the familiar `` peierls '' ( cdw insulating ) and the `` mott '' ( sdw insulating ) phases .",
    "this result , tantalizingly close to the long - sought dominant sc state , has rekindled interest in finding a 1d model which does have clearly dominant sc fluctuations for a range of physically reasonable parameters .    in this paper , we define and study such a model , which we call the `` extended holstein - extended hubbard '' ( eheh ) model .",
    "we will define the model precisely in the ensuing section , but for now we note simply that it involves both on - site ( @xmath0 ) and nearest - neighbor ( @xmath1 ) repulsive e - e interactions and _ non - local _ e - ph interactions .    before describing the eheh model in detail ,",
    "let us first briefly summarize the results in the holstein - extended hubbard ( heh ) model , as these serve as a very useful guide to the surprising subtleties encountered in studies of this seemingly simple model .",
    "the hamiltonian for the heh model is    @xmath2    here electrons move in a tight - binding 1d lattice , where @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron at site @xmath5 with spin @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the electron number operator , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 creates a ( dispersionless einstein ) phonon of frequency @xmath10 at site @xmath5 . the electron density is coupled locally with strength @xmath11 to phonons on the same site .",
    "the e - e interactions are described by the standard extended hubbard model with on - site interaction @xmath0 and nearest neighbor interaction @xmath1 . to recall the results for this model we begin with the case @xmath12",
    ", so the model reduces to the familiar extended hubbard model , @xcite which incorporates only e - e interactions .",
    "we focus on the half - filled case in the physical region with @xmath0 and @xmath1 both positive . for @xmath13 , cdw fluctuations are dominant and the ground state is indeed a long - range ordered cdw . in contrast , for @xmath14 , spin density wave fluctuations are dominant and the ground state is an ( algebraically decaying ) sdw .",
    "recent results @xcite have shown that there also exists a small region around the line @xmath15 in the @xmath16 plane in which the ground state is a long - range ordered bow ( also sometimes called a bond - charge density wave ) .",
    "but there is no evidence for dominant superconducting fluctuations in this model for half - filling with @xmath0 and @xmath1 positive .",
    "this result coincides with the naive expectation that for purely repulsive interactions , superconducting pairing should not exist . for the pure hubbard model ( @xmath17)the exact solution @xcite shows that the charge gap opens immediately for @xmath18 but that it is exponentially small for small @xmath0 .",
    "we consider next the case of e - ph interactions only , in which we recover the equally familiar 1d holstein model .",
    "@xcite in a pioneering study nearly three decades ago , hirsch and fradkin @xcite argued that for spin 1/2 electrons , in the half - filled holstein model a charge gap opens unconditionally for any non - zero e - ph coupling and at any finite phonon frequency . in the adiabatic limit ( @xmath19 )",
    "the gap is also exponentially small in @xmath20 .",
    "while some subsequent studies have supported this results , @xcite others @xcite have suggested that for sufficiently large @xmath10 a finite value of @xmath20 is required to open the gap , so for sufficiently small @xmath20 there is a gapless phase .",
    "similarly , in the full heh model , although the initial study @xcite suggested no gapless phase , more recent studies @xcite , have found the `` gapless '' metallic phase mentioned above in a small region of the @xmath20-@xmath0 plane around the line @xmath21 . ref [ ] gives a plausible intuitive interpretation of this phase , as well as a clear statement of the important caveat of the likely exponentially small nature of any gap in this region makes drawing definitive conclusions from these numerical studies very difficult .",
    "a further reflection of the subtleties in this problem is the fact that other studies , including some recent results , do not find this gapless phase .",
    "@xcite    whatever the ultimate resolution of this issue in the hh model , @xcite the `` fragility '' of the gapless metallic state and the absence of dominant superconducting fluctuations in that model strongly suggest that we seek a more robust model in which it is clear that there are dominant superconducting fluctuations . a hint as to what",
    "sort of model could produce this result comes from considering a problem simpler than the full many - body problem : namely , the two - electron `` bipolaron '' problems .",
    "recently , several groups have studied this relatively more manageable problem in models with _ long - range _ e - ph interactions .",
    "@xcite one of the main differences between the holstein model , which has only on - site e - ph interactions , and models with non - local or long - range e - ph interaction is that in the latter models the mass of the bipolaron is reduced considerably @xcite with the possible enhancement of superconductivity . if these results translate to the many - electron problem , then one should expect _ non - local _ e - ph interactions to enhance the possibility of superconductivity and lead to dominant superconducting fluctuations in a large region of parameter space .",
    "accordingly , in the ensuing sections , we study a model  the `` extended holstein - extended hubbard '' ( eheh ) model which includes both non - local e - ph interactions and the e - e interactions of the extended hubbard model .",
    "we shall see that this model does indeed allow for dominant sc fluctuations in a substantial portion of the @xmath16 plane .",
    "the explicit form of the extended holstein - extended hubbard ( eheh ) model is given by the hamiltonian @xmath22n_{i,\\sigma } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the notation is the same as in eqn .",
    "[ heh ] . in the remainder of the paper",
    ", we will measure all energies in units of @xmath23 .",
    "this model is similar the `` extended holstein - hubbard '' model studied in the case of bipolarons .",
    "@xcite    working in the path - integral representation and tracing out the phonon fields , we can express the action of the eheh model as , @xmath24 where the coupling function @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 } [ 1+cos(\\vec{k}_{3}-\\vec{k}_{1 } ) ] \\label{g}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to analyze this hamiltonian , we will use our version of the multi - scale functional renormalization group ( mfrg ) method .",
    "@xcite this method has been used successfully to study a number of problems @xcite in models involving both e - ph and e - e interactions because it captures not only the electron correlation effects but also the coupling of different energy scales induced by phonon retardation effects . in its simplest form , the mfrg can be used to follow the flows of the various couplings as the energy cut - off is lowered .",
    "however , it has been shown that retardation can modify the various scalings between different correlation functions for the luttinger liquid .",
    "@xcite therefore , instead of studying the couplings , we use the mfrg to study directly the various _ susceptibilities _ which take the contributions from different energy scales into account .",
    "@xcite the dominant ordering can be inferred from the flows of the susceptibilities corresponding to different order parameters as the cutoff is lowered .    in the ensuing section ,",
    "we calculate the susceptibilities corresponding to the charge density wave ( cdw ) , the spin density wave ( sdw ) , and both the the singlet ( ss ) and triplet ( ts ) superconducting order parameters .",
    "the dominant instability among them is determined by the most divergent susceptibility as the cut - off , @xmath27 , is lowered . for completeness , we present in the appendix a short summary of the mfrg method and the scaling equations for the susceptibilities . for further details , readers are referred to several previous articles .",

    "intuitively , this implies that the zero wave vector ordering benefits from the forward scattering but the @xmath60 ordering , like that of the charge ordering , does not .",
    "therefore , a charge gapless sc ordering is preferred to the charge gapped cdw ordering .",
    "the vanishing of @xmath59 at half - filling also means that the charge part and the spin parts are decoupled in the absence of direct e - e interactions . as a result of these peculiar features , this model can be diagonalized exactly , and it can be shown that the charge gap is zero .",
