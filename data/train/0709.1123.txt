    "since the discovery of the neutron - induced fission of uranium by hahn and strassmann in 1938  @xcite , much effort has been made to understand the processes involved in it and to measure the relevant fission parameters .",
    "nowadays several aspects of heavy nuclei fission seem to be clarified .",
    "meitner and frisch suggested a theoretical explanation based on a nuclear liquid - drop model  @xcite , and , over the past 30 years the model has provided considerable insight into nuclear structure @xcite .",
    "it is known that the de - excitation by fission of heavy nuclei depends of the quantum properties of the saddle point and of the associated fission barrier .",
    "the detection of fission isomers has been interpreted by the secondary well in the fission barrier  @xcite .",
    "the nascent fragments begin to be formed at the saddle point , then the system falls down to the fission valley ( energetically preferred paths to fission ) and ends at the scission configuration where fragments interact only by coulomb force .",
    "moreover , at scission , the fragments have acquired a pre - scission kinetic energy . over the fission valley",
    ", the system could be described by collective variables ( such as deformation , vibration , rotation , etc . ) and intrinsic variables ( such as quasi - particles excitations ) .",
    "nevertheless , the dynamics of the fission processes are not yet completely understood  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is neither known the nature of the coupling between the collective and intrinsic degrees of freedom during the descend from the saddle to scission , nor known how it does arise.the physics problem of the description of the fission fragment mass and kinetic energy distributions is very closely related to the topological features in the multi - dimensional potential energy surface  @xcite .    .",
    "standard deviation of the final fragment kinetic energy distribution as a function of the final mass @xmath2 , as a result of monte - carlo simulation ( @xmath4 ) , and experimental data ( @xmath5 ) . both from  @xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0%",
    "]    in the low - energy fission , several final fragment characteristics can be explained in terms of a static scission model of two coaxial juxtaposed deformed spheroidal fragments , provided shell effects , affecting the deformation energy of the fragments .",
    "these shell effects corrections , determined by the strutinsky prescription and discussed by dickmann _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and wilkins  @xcite , subsequently generate secondary minima in the total potential energy surface corresponding to fragments having some particular neutron or proton shell configurations .",
    "if the final fragment characteristics were governed by the properties of the fragments themselves , a basic argument in any statistical theory , one would then expect an increase in the width of the kinetic energy distribution curve for fragment masses @xmath6 , having the above mentioned special neutron or proton shell arrangements .    .",
    "simulated standard deviation of the final fragment kinetic energy distribution as a function of the final mass @xmath2 ( @xmath7 ) , from ref .",
    "@xcite , does not reproduce the experimental broadening around @xmath8 taken from ref .",
    "@xcite.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    in order to address this question , the fission parameters of the primary fragments ( pre - neutron emission ) have been the most studied are the mass yield ( @xmath9 ) and the kinetic energy ( @xmath10 ) distribution .",
    "nevertheless , direct measurements can only be carried out on the final fragments ( post neutron emission ) mass yield @xmath11 and kinetic energy ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "therefore it is crucial to find out what is the relation between the primary and the final kinetic energy distributions , as well as the relation between the @xmath9 and @xmath11 curves . for thermal neutron",

    "this distribution was represented by the mean value of kinetic energy @xmath15 and the standard deviation ( sd ) of the kinetic energy @xmath16 as function of the final mass @xmath2 . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] the plot of both the measured values and the results of a monte - carlo simulation of @xmath16 from a primary distribution @xmath10 without broadenings , shows one pronounced broadening around @xmath17 .",

    "reproduced the experimental broadening on @xmath16 at @xmath19 , but failed to reproduce the broadening around @xmath8 .",
    "they suggested that this broadening must exist in the primary fragment kinetic energy ( @xmath10 ) distribution ,  and accordingly they fitted their experimental data from a distribution with a broadening around @xmath6=126 . in this paper , we present new monte - carlo simulation results for thermal neutron induced fission of @xmath0 .",
    "we compute both the mass and kinetic energy of the primary and final fission fragments , and we show that the broadenings on the @xmath16 curve around the final fragment masses @xmath19 and @xmath3 can be reproduced without assuming an adhoc initial structure on @xmath20 curve .    .",

    "these broadenings are consequence of neutron emission and variations on slopes of primary fragments yield ( @xmath9 ) and mean kinetic energy @xmath54 curves . from our simulation results , another broadening , around @xmath77 , may be predicted .",
