    "semi - classical approaches of quantum gravity ( qg ) are expected to play an important role in revealing some essential features of the fundamental quantum theory of gravity .",
    "one common feature among most of these semi - classical approaches @xcite is the existence of a minimal observable length @xmath0 , i.e. planck length .",
    "this minimal length works as a natural cutoff , which is expected to resolve the known curvature singularities in general relativity .",
    "another feature , in some of these approaches @xcite , is the departure from the relativistic dispersion relation by redefining the physical momentum at the planck scale , or lorentz invariance violation .",
    "this departure could also be a result of spacetime @xcite discreteness , spontaneous symmetry breaking of lorentz invariance in string field theory@xcite , spacetime foam models @xcite or spin - network in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite . besides , there are other approaches such as non - commutative geometry @xcite which predicts a lorentz invariance violation .",
    "these studies indicate that lorentz violation could be a theoretical possibility in several approaches investigating qg .",
    "these approaches predict a departure from lorentz invariance in the form of modified dispersion relations ( mdr ) . it has been argued that mdr could explain the threshold anomalies occurring in ultra high energy cosmic rays and tev photons @xcite . for a recent detailed review along the mentioned lines",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the most interesting forms of mdr , has been suggested by amelino - camelia , et el . in @xcite which has the following form ;    p^2= e^2 ( ) ^2 [ mdr ]    where @xmath1 describes the energy scale at which the dispersion relation is modified and it is taken to be the planck energy .",
    "this modified dispersion relation has been introduced by amelino - camelia , et al . to explain the astrophysical observations of the hard spectra coming from gamma - ray bursters @xcite at cosmological distances .    a theoretical frame work that naturally produce mdr is double special relativity ( dsr)@xcite .",
    "dsr is an extension of special relativity which preserves the relativity principle and extends the invariant quantities to be the planck energy scale beside the speed of light .",
    "the simplest realizations of the idea of dsr are based on a non - linear lorentz transformation in momentum space , which imply a deformed lorentz symmetry such that the usual dispersion relations in special relativity may be modified by planck scale corrections .",
    "it should be mentioned that lorentz invariance violation and lorentz invariance deformation are in general conceptually different scenarios .",
    "here we are going to adopt lorentz invariance deformation scenarios by considering dsr and its extension in models of rainbow gravity .    in the framework of dsr",
    "the definition of the dual position space is not trivial due to the nonlinearity of the lorentz transformation . to overcome this issue , magueijo and",
    "smolin @xcite proposed a doubly general relativity which assumes that the spacetime background felt by a test particle would depend on its energy .",
    "therefore , we will not have a single metric describing spacetime , but a one parameter family of metrics which depends on the energy ( momentum ) of these test particles , forming a _ rainbow _ geometry .",
    "this approach is known as _ gravity rainbow _ and can be understood as follows ; the non - linear of lorentz transformation leads to the following modified dispersion relation e^2 f(e / e_pl)^2- p^2 g(e / e_pl)^2= m^2 [ rainbowdisper ]    where @xmath1 is the planck energy scale , m is the mass of the test particle , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are commonly known as rainbow functions and @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "a modified equivalence principle was proposed in @xcite which requires that one parameter family of energy dependent orthonormal frame fields describe a one parameter family of energy dependent metrics given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "but in the limit @xmath9 general relativity must be recovered . with the definition of one parameter family of energy momentum tensors",
    "einstein s equations are also modified as @xmath10 potential investigations on the gravity rainbow can be found in @xcite .    the choice of the rainbow functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 is very important for making predictions . among different arbitrary choices in @xcite ,",
    "many aspects of the theory have been studied with schwarzschild metric , frw universe and black hole thermodynamics . in this letter",
    "we employ the modified dispersion relation of eq.([mdr ] ) @xcite , which fix the rainbow functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we also employ another choice of rainbow functions @xmath11 which was considered in @xcite .",
    "this particular choice is capable of giving a theory with constant velocity of light and also solves the horizon problem .",
    "using these rainbow functions we study the effect of gravity rainbow , on the frw universe and investigate the new properties of frw universe in the existence of the mdr .",
    "here we review frw universe in rainbow gravity and study its effect as a semi - classical approach of qg in the early universe@xcite .",
    "the most general frw universe in rainbow gravity has been found in @xcite , it has the following metric ds^2=-dt^2+dx^2  ,    where we have considered a spatially flat universe ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) . using the above metric the authors in @xcite found the following modified friedmann equations :    ( h-)^2&= & [ fr1 ] + + -&=&- + & & -(h-)[fr2 ] where @xmath13 .",
    "in addition , the conservation equation is modified to    + 3(h-)(+p)=0 [ conserv ] here we adopt the point of view of ref.@xcite to study the effect of rainbow gravity as a semi - classical approach of qg in the early universe . as we have mentioned earlier the geometry probed by a test particle depends on its energy .",
    "this raises the question ; which metric one might use to describe the evolution of the spacetime . in this framework",
    "we consider a large ensemble of ultra relativistic particles ( dominant in the early universe ) which are in thermal equilibrium and has a typical or an average energy @xmath14 . as in standard cosmology",
    "the continuity equation leads to the first law of thermodynamics d ( v)=-p dv , where @xmath15 .",
    "the above equation and integrability condition @xmath16 @xcite leads to a constant entropy s= v(+p ) t = const.in this section and the coming sections we are going to take the pressure to be @xmath17 , as in standard cosmology which leave the frw spacetime singular at @xmath18 .",
    "for such a pressure , the average energy @xmath19 can be expressed as ~t = c v , where @xmath20 is some constant . using the above equation of state ( eos ) in the conservation equation eq .",
    "( [ conserv ] ) we get the following equation = -3 which can be solved to give a density @xmath21 .",
    "this leads to an average energy = c ^-1 .[aenergy]notice that the above relation between the average energy @xmath19 and the density @xmath22 depends only on the eos parameter @xmath23 .",
    "clearly , the above relation does not depend on the form of mdr chosen for a particular model .",
    "before showing how the mdr mentioned above leads to a nonsingular frw - like metric , it is constructive to discuss the general conditions on the rainbow functions that leads to a nonsingular cosmology . substituting the modified friedmann equation eq.([fr1 ] ) in the continuity equation eq.([conserv ] ) one gets    = - ^3/2 f()=k ( ) , [ conserv11 ] where we wrote @xmath24 as a function of @xmath22 instead of @xmath19 according to eq.([aenergy ] ) and define some function @xmath25 .",
    "this first - order system is well studied in dynamical system ( see e.g. , @xcite , or see @xcite for more general applications ) in cosmological contexts . knowing the fixed points of the function @xmath25 , ( i.e. , its zeros , let us call them @xmath26 ) and its asymptotic behavior enables one to qualitatively describe the behavior of the general solution without actually solving the system .",
    "fixed points are classified according to their stability to stable , unstable , or half - stable . in @xcite",
    "a very similar system has been studied which was expressed in terms of the hubble rate .",
    "it is straight forward to use the same analysis to study the density @xmath22 instead of the hubble rate @xmath27 .",
    "our basic idea for resolving finite - time singularities is to show the existence of an upper bound for the density @xmath22 ( through having a fixed point @xmath28 ) which is reached at an infinite time , or to show the existence of a point at which the density is unbounded ( a potential singularity ) but reached in an infinite time , i.e. , not a physical singularity .",
    "therefore , following the discussion in @xcite , one can show that finite - time singularities ( including big bang singularities ) are absent if one of the following is true ; i ) if @xmath24 grows asymptotically as @xmath29 , or faster . for example , if @xmath30 , where @xmath31 . in this case",
    ", one can calculate the time to reach a potential singularity by integrating eq .",
    "( [ conserv11 ] ) starting from some initial finite density @xmath32 to an infinite one .",
    "this integral leads to t= c  _",
    "^*^^(s-3/2 ) d= , s1/2 this means that the time to reach this potential singularity is infinite , therefore , it is not a finite - time singularity , i.e. , not physical .",
    "ii ) if @xmath33 is differentiable and has a zero at @xmath34 ( notice that in this case the function @xmath25 will have two fixed points , namely , @xmath35 and @xmath28 ) , then according to the analysis in @xcite the cosmological solution is nonsingular and interpolates monotonically between @xmath28 and @xmath35 .    with a particular choice of @xmath36 and @xmath37 a possible resolution of the big bang singularity was proposed in @xcite in the context of quantum cosmology with a perfect fluid .",
    "the rainbow function @xmath36 plays an important role in possible resolution of the big bang singularity , but it has to satisfy one of the above conditions to do that .    we conclude that frw - like rainbow cosmologies are nonsingular ( expressing @xmath24 as a function of the energy @xmath38 after using eq.[aenergy ] ) if at least one of the following is true ; + i ) @xmath24 grows asymptotically as @xmath39 , or faster , + ii ) @xmath33 is differentiable and has a zero at @xmath40 .",
    "+ although the following two sections we are not going to discuss mdr s with power law behavior and integer exponents , it is worth mentioning that these mdr s are widely studied for phenomenological purposes , see for example @xcite .",
    "for this reason , we would like to apply the above criteria on these cases and comment on that . assuming that the asymptotic behavior of the rainbow function takes the form @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is an integer . according to the previous paragraph",
    ", the cosmological solution is nonsingular when @xmath24 grows as @xmath39 or faster .",
    "this leads to an inequality between the parameters `` @xmath42 '' and `` @xmath23 '' which reads @xmath43 .",
    "for example , taking @xmath44 , leads to a nonsingular solution if @xmath45 , i.e. , if @xmath24 grows as @xmath46 or faster .",
    "notice that , the cases which doe not satisfy the previous criteria can still have nonsingular solutions if they satisfy criteria @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , one is lead to the following comment ; among the cases where @xmath41 , the most interesting ones in cosmological contexts are those with @xmath48 , since they are free from finite - time singularities .    in this work we present two interesting mdr s which lead to nonsingular frw - like cosmologies",
    "the first belongs to case @xmath49 , and the second belongs to case @xmath47 as we will see in the coming sections .",
    "now we employe the modified dispersion relation which is proposed by the amelino - camelia , et al . in eq .",

    "we are interested in an eos parameter @xmath54 , particularly the case where @xmath55 ( i.e. , radiation ) , but we are going to leave the expressions as general as possible .    the modified freidmann equation due to mdr will be given as follows :    h^2&= & (  ) ^2 .",

    "[ solution ]    now let us show that the time taken by the solution to evolve from some finite density @xmath61 to an infinite one ( a potential singularity ) is infinite .",

    "( [ conserv1 ] ) t= -_^^ _",
    "p^-^-[-1]d = since the time to reach this infinite density is infinite , there is no finite - time singularities .",

    "p^-^-[-1]d=    considering the above time calculations , one can see that the solution does not suffer from any finite - time singularity .",

    "[ solution2 ]    finally , it is important to check the behavior the mdr of eq.([mdr ] ) at the planck scale to investigate if density of states would diverge or not @xcite .",

    "in this section , we use the dispersion relation proposed by magueijo - smolin in @xcite to fix the rainbow functions and investigate its impact on frw universe through the gravity rainbow approach @xcite . according to the magueijo - smolin dispersion relation @xcite ,",
