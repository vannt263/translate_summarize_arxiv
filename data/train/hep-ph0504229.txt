    "the discovery in the late 1980 s by the european muon collaboration ( emc ) that the fraction of the spin of the proton carried by the quarks is unexpectedly small @xcite , caused much excitement in the nuclear and particle physics communities .",
    "the `` proton spin crisis '' prompted many new experiments , leading to major new insights into the spin structure of the proton .",
    "however , a thorough theoretical understanding of the non - perturbative parton distributions still remains an exciting challenge .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the spin - independent and spin - dependent quark distributions in the framework developed by bentz , thomas and collaborators , in which proper - time regularization is applied to the nambu@xmath0jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite in order to simulate the effects of confinement  @xcite .",
    "this model is attractive because of its covariance and the transparent description of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "we construct the nucleon as a bound state solution of the relativistic faddeev equation  @xcite in the quark - diquark approximation @xcite , where both scalar and axial - vector diquark channels are included .",
    "this quark - diquark description of the single nucleon has the further advantage that it can be extended to finite baryon density  @xcite .",
    "we pay special attention to the polarized structure of the nucleon , comparing our results for the quark distributions with the empirical parameterizations .",
    "the spin - dependent quark light - cone momentum distribution in the nucleon , at leading twist , is defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : defqd ] ) , where @xmath1 is the quark field of flavour @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the bjorken scaling variable and the subscript @xmath4 reminds us that only connected matrix elements are included .",
    "@xmath5 we normalize the nucleon state vector according to non - covariant light - cone normalization : @xmath6 .",
    "the spin - independent distribution , @xmath7 , is defined by the replacement @xmath8 in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : defqd ] ) . to determine the quark distributions in this model , it is convenient to express eq .",
    "( [ eqn : defqd ] ) in the form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the quark two - point function in the bound nucleon .",
    "hence , within any model that describes the nucleon as a bound state of quarks , the distribution functions can be associated with a straightforward feynman diagram calculation .",
    "the feynman diagrams considered here are given in fig .",
    "[ fig : feydiagrams ] , where in our model the resulting distributions have no support for negative @xmath3 .",
    "therefore this is essentially a valence quark picture . by separating the isospin factors ,",
    "the spin - dependent @xmath11 and @xmath12 distributions in the proton can be expressed as @xmath13 the superscripts @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to the scalar , axial - vector or mixing terms , respectively , the subscript @xmath17 implies a quark diagram and similarly @xmath18 a diquark diagram . because the scalar diquark has spin zero , we have @xmath19 and hence the polarization of the @xmath12-quark arises exclusively from the axial - vector and the mixing terms .",
    "similar expressions hold for the spin - independent distributions , but in that case there is no mixing contribution ( @xmath20 ) @xcite .    ) .",
    "the single line represents the quark propagator and the double line the diquark @xmath21-matrix .",
    "the shaded oval denotes the quark - diquark vertex function and the operator insertion has the form @xmath22 for the spin - dependent distribution and @xmath23 for the spin - independent case . ]",
    "importantly , in this covariant framework , the ward identities corresponding to number and momentum conservation are satisfied , guaranteeing the validity of the baryon number and momentum sum rules @xcite .",
    "the njl model is a chiral effective quark theory that is characterized by a 4-fermi contact interaction of the form , @xmath24 , where the @xmath25 represent matrices in dirac , colour and flavour space and @xmath26 are coupling constants  @xcite . applying fierz transformations , the interaction lagrangian can be decomposed into various interacting @xmath27 and @xmath28 channels . writing only those terms relevant to this discussion , we have @xmath29 where @xmath16 is the current quark mass .",

    "the terms @xmath36 and @xmath37 represent the interactions in the scalar ( @xmath38 ) and axial - vector ( @xmath39 ) diquark channels and are used to construct the nucleon as a quark - diquark bound state .",
    "the couplings @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are related to the original couplings , @xmath26 , via the fierz transformation , but we use them here as free parameters which will be fixed by the properties of the pion and the nucleon .    solving the appropriate bethe - salpeter equations ,",

    "the spin sum in our model is @xmath104 , which is smaller than the result of the pure scalar model , but still somewhat larger than the accepted value of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy primarily reflects the absence of the @xmath106(1 ) axial anomaly @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of structure function and hence quark distribution ratios at large @xmath3 has been an area of considerable debate @xcite and is one of the regions where perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) offers firm predictions  @xcite .",

    "although the empirical parameterizations are constrained to give @xmath109 for these ratios as @xmath108 , we note that the systematic errors in both empirical ratios are very large in the region @xmath115 @xcite .     where @xmath116 , at the scale @xmath117 .",

    "the experimental results are from hall a at jefferson lab @xcite ( solid squares ) and hermes @xcite ( solid stars ) . ]",
    "it is important to note that the pqcd predictions for the mixed flavour ratios are somewhat model dependent , as assumptions have to be made about the relative strengths of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 contributions to the nucleon wavefunction .",
    "a more rigorous pqcd prediction , relying only on helicity conservation , is possible for the single flavour ratios @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",

    "using a covariant quark - diquark model for the nucleon , including both scalar and axial - vector diquark channels , we calculated the spin - independent and spin - dependent quark light - cone momentum distributions and structure functions .",

    "we paid special attention to the single flavour ratios @xmath121 and the asymmetries @xmath137 and @xmath132 , finding good agreement with recent experimental results from jlab .",
    "these results indicate that diquark correlations are an essential feature of the non - perturbative structure of the nucleon .",
    "in particular , the admixture of axial - vector diquarks , though small , is essential to obtain the observed agreement with empirical data .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that a very important advantage of this covariant quark - diquark model is that it can be readily extended to the case of finite nucleon density .",
    "the results presented in this paper strongly suggest that this model should provide a reliable basis from which to begin investigation of the medium modifications of both spin - independent and spin - dependent structure functions .",
