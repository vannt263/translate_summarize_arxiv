    "<S> the spin - excitation frequencies at these wave vectors remain vanishing in the range @xmath104 that determines the domain of this phase . </S>",
    "<S> this phase can be confronted with the two - sublattice metamagnetic phase of the analogous classical heisenberg model , which in our notations exists in the range @xmath105 and has the same ordering vectors @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the frequency of these new minima is small and decreases with increasing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the smallness of the frequency indicates that the correlation length @xmath111 of the considered sro is large . from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) one can see that for small temperatures and large distances @xmath112 the main contribution to the sum is made by a small vicinity of the dispersion minima . </S>",
    "<S> using this observation one can obtain an exponential dependence of the correlations on the distance and estimate @xmath111 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath113 we found @xmath114 and for @xmath115 we determined @xmath116 , where @xmath117 is the lattice spacing . </S>",
    "<S> it should be noted that using a large but finite lattice we introduce an upper limit for the correlation length and a lower bound for the gap at the ordering vector . for the considered large lattice </S>",
    "<S> this gap is extremely small in the ordered states and its magnitude is comparable with the accuracy of the used optimization procedure . a complication arises when an ordering vector is incommensurate , as it happens for @xmath118 . in the general case this vector does not coincide with any allowed wave vector for the considered finite lattice . in this instance we are unable to determine the exact location of the ordering vector and the size of the gap , as in fig .  5 for @xmath119 </S>",
    "<S> however , the tendency for the decrease of the gap is well seen in this figure and there is good reason to believe that the sro gives way to lro at @xmath120 . </S>",

    "<S> the ordering vectors reach the points @xmath123 [ see fig . 1 , 2 ( e ) and 3 ] . the values of the frustration parameter @xmath124 correspond to the case when the interaction between nnn spins is much stronger than between nearest neighbors , @xmath125 . in this situations </S>",
    "<S> the lattice is divided into three sublattices with the elementary translation vectors @xmath126 . within any of the sublattices </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between spins is characterized by the large parameter @xmath127 , while the inter - sublattice interaction is given by the smaller parameter @xmath128 . as a result </S>",
