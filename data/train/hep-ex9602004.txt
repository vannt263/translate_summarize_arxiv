    "current models explaining the evolution of the universe and the measured slight anisotropy of the cosmic background radiation have in common , that they predict an appreciable contribution of non - luminous , non - baryonic matter in the form of a mixture of relativistic , light particles and non - relativistic , massive particles ( so - called hot and cold dark matter ) .",
    "accelerator experiments and results from the first round of dark matter experiments explored up to now only a small range of masses and types of possible candidate particles . in particular they leave room for an interpretation of cold dark matter in terms of weakly interacting massive particles with masses between 20 gev and a few hundred gev . here",
    "a fitting candidate is the neutralino of the `` minimal supersymmetric standard model''(ref .",
    "the cross section of these particles are expected to be of electroweak strength , with coherent or axial coupling .",
    "these particles are supposed to be concentrated in a self gravitating , spherical halo around our galaxy with a maxwellian velocity distribution in the galactic frame with a mean velocity of 300 km@xmath1sec and a local density at the solar system of 0.3 gev/@xmath2 .",
    "the detection reaction of neutralinos would be elastic scattering with a detector nucleus and the nuclear recoil energy would be the measurable quantity . under the given assumptions the mean recoil energy would be + @xmath3 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the masses of the detector nucleus and of the neutralino respectively .",
    "the recoil spectrum falls off exponentially with @xmath6    for all detector materials the recoil energies are expected to be smaller than 100 kev and depending on more detailed assumptions on the cross section the expected event rates in the range between 4 to 20 kev are between 0.01 to 100 events / kgd . therefore in order to ensure a reasonable countrate a high target mass of more than 50 to 100 kg is needed , especially if one wants to detect the 5% annual variation in count rate due to the motion of the earth around the sun .",
    "the latter would be the decisive signature for the detection of dark matter candidates .",
    "due to background limitations , however , current experimental sensitivities are still far away ( @xmath7factor 100 ) to reach the small interaction rates predicted .",
    "we propose a new approach for cold dark matter detection , which has the potential of substantially improved sensitivity .",
    "since a direct detection of dark matter candidates proceeds via elastic scattering off a detector nucleus one has to rely entirely on the observation of the small ionizing signal of the recoiling nucleus in the energy range of several kev to several tens of kev .",
    "since present detectors are sensitive to all kind of ionizing radiation , an extremely low level of radioactive impurities in the detector material and its surroundings is necessary , as well as powerfull active and passive background rejection techniques . in order to reduce the overall background sensitivity we suggest to apply a detection method , which is exclusively sensitive to the high ionization density of recoiling nuclei with a @xmath710 , but is insensitive to the much smaller specific ionization of ordinary @xmath8-radiation .",
    "as is well known from bubble chamber operation , vapor droplet formation in superheated liquids is a process of precisely this kind .",
    "but in contrast to the usual cyclic bubble chamber operation , the detection of nuclear recoils requires only moderately superheated liquids and a quasi - continuous operation becomes possible ( ref.[2,3 ] ) .",
    "it turns out that this technique is successfully applied in superheated drop detectors for neutron dosimetry . here",
    "10 to 20@xmath9 m diameter droplets of a superheated liquid e.g. ccl@xmath10f@xmath10 ( freon 12 ) are dispersed homogeneousely in an elastic , clear medium , such as water saturated polyacrylamide gel ( ref .",
    "[ 4,5,6 ] ) . each of these droplets acts as an individual miniature bubble chamber . under ambient temperature and pressure ,",
    "i.e. 25@xmath11c and 1 bar , the droplets remain in a metastable , superheated condition .",
    "only when a neutron hits a droplet the recoiling nucleus triggers the explosive formation of a gas bubble about 1 mm in diameter .",
    "this event is accompanied by an acoustic shock wave , which can be detected with piezoelectric transducers .",
    "neutron counters of this kind are commercially available and have neutron detection thresholds as low as 10 kev , i.e. precisely in the range of sensitivity needed for our application .",
    "they are insensitive to @xmath12- and @xmath13- radiation , as can be shown by placing the detectors close to a strong @xmath14co source .",
    "the devices used in our particular tests were obtained from bubble technology industries ( ref.[7 ] ) .",
    "the polymer is contained in a transparent polycarbonate test tube with an active detection volume of 4 cm in length and 1.4 cm in diameter .",
    "the device is equipped with a piston . upon unscrewing the piston",
    ", the detector becomes sensitive . after an exposure",
    "the bubbles are held in place by the gel until the piston is reset and the gas bubbles are again reduced to liquid droplets .",
    "properly recompressed after every exposure , the detectors can be used over years .",
    "standard detectors for dosimetry are loaded with about 0.4% active material , with typical sensitivities of about 20 bubbles / mrem for neutrons above 100 kev . upon our request detectors",
    "were fabricated with 3% , 10% and 25% loading . up to 40%",
    "loading appears feasible with the existing technology .",
    "our experimental efforts so far concentrated on the following issues : event detection , localization , detector performance and background studies . in detectors with",
    "more than 3% loading the elasic medium becomes opalescent , non - transparent and eventually optical detection of the bubbles becomes impossible .",
    "for this reason and also in order to be able to trigger electronically on the events we investigated acoustic detection of bubble formation .",
    "piezoelectric sensors had already been shown to be sensitive to the sound of a vaporizing droplet ( ref.[8 ] ) .",
    "+    = 10.00 cm = 12.00 cm    in order to simulate a larger detector volume several bti test tube devices were immersed in a ( 28x28x28 ) @xmath2 water tank , with four piezoelectric sensors installed at the tank walls .",
    "the piezoelectric detector surface makes direct contact with the water .",
    "the sensors are wideband detectors ( canded type - wd ) with a sensitivity band width ranging from 100 to 1000 khz .",
    "their signals are fed into low noise current sensitive preamplifiers lm6365 with a gain of 15v/@xmath9a and a noise characteristic of 1.5 pa/@xmath15 . at 5",
    "cm distance a bubble event gives a signal with a maximum amplitude between 50 and 200 mv above a noise band of 2 mv rms at the preamp output .",
    "the signals from bubble formation are very characteristic ( see fig.1 ) and easily distinguishable from background signals : all bubble signals start off with a sharp negative pulse lasting about 2@xmath9sec ; after this the piezoelectric sensor starts heavily ringing at a frequency of about 25 khz .",
    "the amplitudes of these rather fast oscillations are then modulated by a much slower ( khz ) oscillation which varies from event to event .",
    "the whole phenomenon lasts several msec .",
    "our tests indicate that acoustic time - of flight methods can be used to locate bubbles . for these measurements",
    "the preamp signals are fed into a fadc system and the event position is calculated using a neural network trained for our detector geomtry .",
    "a video recording allows correlating the electronic signals to individual bubbles in the ( low loading ) detectors .",
    "our tests indicate that an event localization is possible with a resolution of 0.5 cm in the tank . in a different experiment we measured the speed of sound in a detector gel with 0.4% loading to be 1200@xmath1690 msec@xmath17 , close to the speed of sound in water ( 1440 m@xmath18 ) .    in order to study the detector performance we spiked several detectors of different loading ( 0.4% , 0.8% , 1.5% , 3.0% ) with a known ( 1 - 10 bq ) @xmath19-activity of @xmath20am .",
    "the 100 kev am recoils come in coincidence with a 59.4 kev @xmath13-ray , which allows in principal the determination of recoil detection efficiencies .",
    "a variation of temperature translates into a variation of superheat according to the phase diagram and therefore by varying the operating temperature of the detector we can study its response to different ionization densities . in particular we find a step - function like increase in countrate between 37 and 40@xmath11c where the detector becomes sensitive to @xmath19-particles . by going to still higher temperature a strong rise in countrate sets in above 45@xmath11c , where electrons and @xmath13-rays start to trigger the detector",
    "being not sensitive to conventional @xmath21 and @xmath13 - radiation is the big asset of our detector .",
    "still the superheated droplets will be sensitive to the 100 kev nuclear recoils following 5 to 6 mev @xmath19- decays due to the presence of u / th daughters in the detector material .",
    "this background can be controlled in two ways : by raising the threshold of the detector , i.e. by varying the operating parameters of pressure or temperature , the @xmath19- induced background can be measured separately and subtracted ; alternatively a sensitivity of the order of 10@xmath22cts@xmath1kg@xmath1day can be reached if the @xmath23u and @xmath24th contamintion is brought down to a level of of 10@xmath25g@xmath1 g . since our detector consists essentially of water ( 58% ) , freon ( 40% ) and about 2% acrylomide we are confident that this low level of activity can be achieved .",
    "highly purified water of the sno - collaboration is available with a purity as high as 2 to 5x10@xmath26g@xmath1 g u / th .    in order to assey the present intrinsic background and to understand its origin ,",
    "measurements were performed on the surface and at the location of the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) 2000 m under ground with and without 20 cm water shielding . at the surface 0.5",
    "cts / d were recorded for standard detectors with 0.4% loading ; in the mine two detectors were exposed up to now and showed no counts after 80 days .",
    "the detector masses envolved in these measurements were however too small to allow meaningful conclusions about the intrinsic background of the devices .",
    "independent of these direct measurements the detector material was also tested for radioactive contaminations at the gran sasso low activity counting facility .",
    "limits of 2.2 bq / kg were obtained for the @xmath24th contamination and again the measurements were compromised by the small mass of the test samples . on the other hand substantial @xmath27cs , @xmath28cs activities of about 0.2bq / kg were found in the samples ( this is due to the presence of cscl salt , which is mixed into the gel in order to match the gel density to the density of liquid freon ) .",
    "although the associated @xmath12- and @xmath13 activities are not harmfull by themselves for our application , we suspect an important contamination of u / th of the unpurified salt itself .",
    "this point is subject to further clarification .",
    "since we are handicapped by the small size of our test counters , we foresee as a next step to build a 1  kg prototype for more detailed background studies on surface and underground .",
    "it will be read out with six piezoelectric sensors .",
    "this detector will later be installed at the sno site , where space is already foreseen for this experiment . with the detector installed in a deep underground laboratory ( sno ) ,",
    "consideration has still to be given to the fast neutron component coming from the rock walls . with the measured flux of 3 x 10@xmath29 n/@xmath30sec a passive shielding of 1 m ( borated ) water",
    "will reduce the neutron induced countrate to a level of sev .",
    "10@xmath31n / day .",
    "we suggest the use of moderately superheated liquids in the form of a superheated droplet detector for a new type of dark matter search experiment .",
    "the advantage of this method for dark matter detection is , that the detector material is cheap , readily available and that it is easily possible to fabricate a large mass detector . from its easy operating conditions and its suitable isotopic composition (",
    "@xmath32 is a spin-@xmath33@xmath34 isotope ) ccl@xmath10f@xmath10 , i.e. freon 12 , is an interesting active material . even more attractive because of its higher mass is cf@xmath35br .",
    "it has a similar vapor pressure curve as freon 12 and is non - inflammable .",
    "compared to alternative techniques our method is insensitive to @xmath19 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 radiation , and avoids the need of complex cryogenics .",
    "we thank m. beaulieu , j .- p . martin and g. beaudoin ( udem ) for their assistance in designing our readout system and for setting up the neural net .",
