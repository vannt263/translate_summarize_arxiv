    "quantum channels play a key role in quantum information theory . in particular , bosonic gaussian channels model most optical communication links , such as optical fibers or free space information transmission  @xcite .",
    "one of the central characteristics of quantum channels is their classical capacity . a lot of attention",
    "has already been devoted to the study of the classical capacity of gaussian channels .",
    "since gaussian encodings are more relevant for experimental implementations , easier to work with analytically , and conjectured to be optimal @xcite , the so - called gaussian classical capacity was evaluated for specific gaussian channels @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we greatly simplify the calculation of these capacities  @xcite for an arbitrary single - mode gaussian channel .",
    "namely , we show that any such channel is indistinguishable from a newly defined fiducial channel , preceded by a phase shift and followed by a general gaussian unitary . since neither the phase shift at the channel s input nor the gaussian unitary at the channel s output affects the input energy constraint or changes the output entropy , the capacities of this channel are equal to those of the fiducial channel .",
    "this conclusion also holds for any cascade of gaussian channels since the latter is equivalent to another gaussian channel .",
    "our results allow us to go beyond previous works on the gaussian capacity @xcite and provide its unified analytical expression valid for any gaussian channel in some energy range , where it is additive . in this range",
    "we prove that the capacity can not exceed the gaussian capacity by more than @xmath0 bits ( generalizing @xcite ) , the latter becoming the actual capacity if the minimum - output entropy conjecture for phase - insensitive gaussian channels  @xcite is true .",
    "let @xmath1 be a single - mode gaussian state , where the coherent vector @xmath2 and the covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath3 are the first- and second - order moments of the @xmath4 dimensionless quadratures , respectively , with @xmath5 .",
    "then , a single - mode gaussian channel @xmath6 is a completely positive trace - preserving map which is closed on the set of gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "it transforms input states with moments @xmath7 to output states with moments @xmath8 according to @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the displacement induced by the channel , @xmath11 is a @xmath12 real matrix , and @xmath13 is a @xmath12 real , symmetric , and non - negative matrix . for simplicity , we choose @xmath14 in what follows ( the capacity is not affected by @xmath10 ) , and focus on the action of the map @xmath6 on second - order moments using the simplified notation @xmath15 . then , the map @xmath6 is fully characterized by matrices @xmath11 and @xmath13 , which must satisfy @xmath16 @xcite , where @xmath17 is the symplectic form  @xcite . in the following ,",
    "we use the parameters @xmath18 where @xmath19 may be a channel transmissivity ( if @xmath20 ) or amplification gain ( if @xmath21 ) , while @xmath22 characterizes the added noise . the map @xmath6 describes a quantum channel if @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is an entanglement breaking channel if @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the single - mode gaussian channels can therefore be conveniently represented in a ( @xmath19,@xmath25 ) plane , see fig .",
    "[ fig : entbreak ] .",
    "any single - mode gaussian channel @xmath6 can be decomposed as @xmath26 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are gaussian unitaries , and @xmath29 is a canonical channel characterized by the matrices @xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the action of a gaussian unitary @xmath31 on a gaussian state can be completely specified by a symplectic transformation @xmath32 acting on the second - order moments of the state ( we ignore first - order moments ) , so that the canonical decomposition may be written as @xmath33 .",
    "one can define seven classes of canonical channels @xmath29 ( see table  [ table : channels ] ) @xcite .",
    "the first five channels in table  [ table : channels ] can be treated together , and we refer to them collectively as thermal channels , @xmath34 : @xmath35 where @xmath36 if @xmath37 and @xmath38 if @xmath39 . as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : graph_ad ] ( a ) , any channel @xmath40 can be physically realized by a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath41 followed by a two - mode squeezer ( tms ) with gain @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "for the zero - transmission ( @xmath43 ) , lossy ( @xmath44 ) , amplification ( @xmath45 ) , and classical additive - noise channel ( @xmath46 ) , the output is given by the signal s output of the tms , and these four canonical channels correspond to phase - insensitive channels .",
    "for the fifth canonical channel , i.e. , the phase - conjugating channel ( @xmath47 ) , the output is given by the idler s output of the tms .",
    "these five channels map any thermal state to a thermal state , so we call them thermal channels . each particular channel @xmath34 corresponds to a single point in fig .",
    "[ fig : entbreak ] , where the relations between @xmath48 and @xmath49 are given in table [ table : channels ] .",
    "finally , the sixth and seventh canonical channels are the classical signal ( or quadrature erasing ) channel @xmath50 and the single - quadrature classical noise channel @xmath51 , which are not thermal channels ( see @xcite ) .",
    "for gaussian quantum channels .",
    "each thermal channel @xmath34 is associated with a particular point @xmath52 .",

    "an example of @xmath57 is given by the dashed line , where @xmath58 and @xmath59.,scaledwidth=49.5% ]",
    "now , our central point is that the above canonical decomposition is not always useful for evaluating capacities of bosonic channels with input energy constraint ( which is needed , otherwise the capacities are infinite ) .",
    "indeed , the gaussian unitary @xmath60 that precedes the canonical channel @xmath29 affects , in general , the input energy .",
    "therefore , we introduce a new decomposition in terms of a fiducial channel @xmath61 , where the preceding unitary is passive and does not affect the input energy restriction .",
    "we show that this decomposition has the major advantage that the energy - constrained capacity of any gaussian channel reduces to that of the fiducial channel @xmath61 .",
    "the latter generalizes @xmath40 by introducing squeezing in the added noise @xmath62 thus , it depends on three parameters @xmath63 , and we denote it by @xmath54 .",
