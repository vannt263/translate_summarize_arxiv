    "today s computers are turing machines governed by deterministic laws .",
    "it has been noticed that such machines can not solve certain class of problems because of their inability to produce random numbers .",
    "for example , it is impossible to simulate a simple radioactive decay . a computer program that would be able to do this",
    "must be able to produce a sequence of times of decays which is by no means deterministic .",
    "+ consequently , a complete machine that is believed to be the ultimate universal computing machine is referred to as `` turing machine with a random number generator '' or `` probabilistic turing machine '' @xcite .",
    "+ since computers play an increasingly important role in modern science and life , it is also increasingly important to develop `` good '' random number generators .",
    "+ the classical approach is to approximate truly random , non - deterministic generator of random numbers by a carefully chosen mathematical function which produces approximately random numbers .",
    "such a function of course can be calculated on turing machines . without loss of generality",
    "we will only consider random bit generators ( rbg ) .",
    "the basic technique is as follows .",
    "first , one chooses at will an integer number @xmath1 ( so called _ seed _ ) from a large set of numbers that are known to be valid seeds for a given function @xmath2 .",
    "( good coverage of the theory and practice of pseudo - random generators may be found in @xcite . )",
    "then one calculates : @xmath3    iterating this as follows :    @xmath4    results in a sequence of numbers :    @xmath5    these numbers converted to bits and put together side - by - side form a long sequence of _ pseudo - random bits_. sometimes , not all bits from the numbers @xmath6 are used to form the sequence but only a pre - selected part ( for example the most significant half ) . + variants of this basic technique exists but the underlying property of all pseudo - random generators is that they _ must _ accept a seed , a form of mathematical initial state that completely determines the sequence of bits produced thereafter .",
    "the idea behind all this is that to someone who does not know the seed and/or function @xmath2 ( or does not care about them ) , the sequence of bits produced appears to be random .",
    "+ pseudo - random numbers can be produced efficiently and are used a lot in simulations of stochastic processes like passage of particles through matter @xcite or speeding up of calculation of exact problems such as multi - dimensional integration or primality testing @xcite . + while good generator functions which approximate true randomness quite well for most purposes @xcite , it is absolutely clear that the entropy of the whole pseudo - random sequence , no matter how long , is equal to the entropy of the seed only , which is usually not more than 16 to 64 bits .",
    "this is most clearly seen by noting that the optimal compression of a sequence of type ( [ eq : sum ] ) would result only in the seed @xmath1 and a decompression routine that equals @xmath2 .",
    "since @xmath2 is usually publicly known it does not represent a useful source of entropy , thus the only entropy left is that of the seed . and",
    "even this tiny entropy , namely the entropy of the seed , has to be provided by somebody or something that has nothing to do with the pseudo - random generator itself .",
    "therefore the conclusion that pseudo - random generators do not generate entropy seems unavoidable .",
    "+ for applications in cryptography this may be a killing property .",
    "for example provability of information - theoretic security of quantum cryptography protocols such as bb84 @xcite , or maurer s skapd protocol @xcite assumes existence of generators of truly random ( non - deterministic ) numbers .",
    "even much less complicated applications such as pin or tan number generators may not be proven secure if the numbers generated are based on a deterministic procedure .",
    "cases are known where seeding by a low - entropy source ( such as clock ) led to serious compromise of the subsequent cryptographic protocol .",
    "an example is attack to the netscape s 40 bit rc4 - 40 @xcite challenge data and encryption keys which could be revealed in a minute or so @xcite .",
    "the authors of that article suspect that 128 bit version rc4 - 128 would not be much harder to break either if seeding is done in a similar fashion .",
    "( this example also shows how a perfectly good cryptographic method may be ruined by a non - educated or malicious implementator . )",
    "+ all these cases boil down to the fact that it is hard to get truly random data form today s computing machines ( usually pc s ) .",
    "some ad - hoc methods exist @xcite to extract a handful of random bits per second , but the only way to get a lot of random bits of guaranteed quality in a short time is to add a non - deterministic random bit generator to the computer , thus effectively realizing the probabilistic turing machine .",
    "+ problem , however , is to construct a good enough generator , whose output can be for all practical purposes considered as being truly unpredictable and random .",
    "+ we describe , in this article , a theory and one practical realization of a reliable and fast random bit generator which should not be expensive to produce .",
    "[ sect : method ]    since it is obvious that only physical reality may provide true randomness , the non - deterministic rbg should be based on a repeated measurements of identical , independent physics processes and associated method for extraction of random bits from these measurements .",
    "an rbg should be characterized by the following :    1 .",
    "its output can not be predicted regardless of the amount of knowledge about it ( just as it would be impossible to predict outcome of flipping a fair coin by knowing exactly how it looks ) ; 2 .",
    "two identical generators may not be synchronized to produce the same sequence of bits .",
    "the second requirement could well be regarded as the definition of a non - deterministic generator .",
    "this requirement may be reformulated so that a non - deterministic generator may not accept an initial state .",
    "this is opposite to pseudo - random generators which must accept an initial state .",
    "+ since we do not expect that measuring of independent physics processes , that is making independent identical experiments whose outcome is random , may form any pseudo - random pattern we are left with only two problems associated with non - deterministic random bit generators .",
    "these are :    1 .    statistical bias , defined as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 stands for probability of ones ; 2 .",
    "correlations among bits , among which the most important _ serial correlation coefficient _ is defined as @xcite : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes @xmath11-th bit in the sequence .    both are measures of imperfections that are inevitable in practical realizations of generators .",
    "correlations appear if the measured physics processes ( experiments ) are not completely statistically independent of each other , whereas statistical bias is mainly associated with imperfections in the measuring equipment ( eg . electronics ) .",
    "serial correlation coefficient is a measure of the extent to which a bit ( in a sequence ) depends on a previous bit ( @xcite ) , and takes on a value between -1 and 1 .",
    "we suppose that correlations between bits further apart ( corresponding to experiments further apart in time ) are smaller if not negligible . for truly",
    "random sequences of bits , of course , both statistical bias and correlations tend to zero , when the length of the sequence goes to infinity . + the method presented here solves both problems .",
    "it consists of counting events which are result of measurement of some random physical process .",
    "for example events may be a radioactive decay or taping of rain drops on a tin roof .",
    "these events appear at random but measured for a long time they have some mean period , @xmath12 .",
    "the state of the counter is examined at regular time intervals with the period @xmath13 .",
    "if the counter state is found to be odd then the output from the generator is `` 1 '' , otherwise it is `` 0 '' . unlike some other methods which require exponential distribution of time intervals between events @xcite or sampling of an analog white noise source @xcite , we will show that this method , in the limit of slow sampling ( @xmath14 ) leads to vanishing bias and correlations regardless of the distribution of the random process being measured .",
    "therefore it may used to extract random bits from a large variety of processes .",
    "[ sect : realization ]    useful non - deterministic random bit generator built in hardware should satisfy several requirements :    1 .",
    "bit sampling method must not rely strongly on any property of the measured physical process other than its randomness , at least in some easily achievable limit ; 2 .",
    "generator should withstand reasonable tolerance in components and operating conditions ( eg . supply voltage , temperature , em noise ) without the need for ( re)calibration or compensation ; 3 .",
    "possible malfunctions during the lifetime of the generator should be foreseen and checked for at each generator restart ( for example like recommended in @xcite ) or even continuously ; 4 .",
    "sequences of bits produced by the generator should pass , with a high probability , any known statistical randomness test .    in the generator described here physical processes in zener diode",
    "serve as a source of randomness .",
    "the noise voltage at terminals of the diode is `` measured '' by a special electronic circuit at regular time intervals .",
    "each measurement results in a random bit .",
    "the circuit presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] follows the method of operation described in the previous section .",
    "it consists of the following five blocks :    1 .   a source of electric noise ; 2 .   a dc decoupling capacitor @xmath15 ; 3 .   a circuit for digitizing the noise voltage consisting of a comparator controlled with a rough automatic zero - bias correction circuitry ; 4 .   a counting circuit ( jk flip - flop ) ; 5 .   a sampling circuit which delivers a bit upon an external request .",
    "it is a well known fact that a zener diode operating in a reverse polarity and the current strength near the knee , can serve as a noise generator .",
    "for example , a 6.8 volt commercial zener diode can produce a noise fluctuation of an amplitude of 30 to 50 mv ( peak to peak ) with a mean frequency of zero crossings of the order of 10 mhz @xcite .",
    "+ it is also well known that a zener diode with a knee voltage of less than 6.2 v operates mainly in the quantum mechanical ( tunneling ) regime , while the diodes with the knee above that operate mainly in the micro plasma regime @xcite .",
    "both regimes have ideal properties of unpredictability needed for a truly random noise voltage source .",
    "+ the best temperature stability of the noise amplitude is also obtained in the zener diodes with the knee voltage of approx .",
    "6.2 v , because in this case the two regimes with opposite temperature coefficients are in equilibrium @xcite . the same condition is also optimal from the point of the long term stability .",
    "+ the generator functions in the following way .",
    "noisy voltage from the zener diode is ac decoupled from the digitizing stage which consists of a comparator comp controlled with a rough automatic zero - bias feedback control .",
    "the role of the comparator is to convert tiny analog noise to the digital signal suitable for further processing . + the capacitor @xmath15 in the series with the output resistance @xmath16 of the noise source and the effective input resistance @xmath17 of the comparator forms a major contribution to an unwanted `` memory '' .",
    "the timely persistence @xmath18 of this memory is equal to : @xmath19 voltage amplitudes of any two noise variations which happen within the period @xmath18 will be mutually correlated because of the electric charge in the capacitor @xmath15 which has no time to discharge through the resistance in the system . if physical events are not completely independent of each other there will be another persistence @xmath20 giving rise to the total memory : @xmath21 luckily , this `` memory '' effect dies off exponentially with the time distance between the two variations , thus one can conclude that any two variations that are distant enough in time may be considered as statistically independent .",
    "whenever this applies , our method is valid , as will be explained later .",
    "nevertheless , the `` memory '' of the circuit limits frequency bandwidth of the noise and sets an absolute upper limit to the bit extraction rate from the generator , which limit is independent of the latter bit extraction method .",
    "+ the negative input of the comparator comp is connected to a suitable dc reference voltage @xmath22 . between the two inputs of the comparator",
    "( positive and negative ) a small dc `` offset '' voltage can be induced by virtue of the resistor @xmath17 and the control current @xmath23 that flows through it . as the result ,",
    "the positive input of the comparator `` sees '' the sum of the offset voltage and the noise voltage .",
    "whenever the sum exceeds the reference voltage @xmath22 , the output of the comparator goes into the high logical state `` 1 '' , whereas when the sum goes below the @xmath22 , the output goes into the low logical state `` 0 '' .",
    "this is illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ]         + by setting the control current @xmath23 a little lower or higher , the output of the comparator comp spends respectively a little more or less time in the logical state `` 1 '' . at certain strength of the control current @xmath23",
    ", one can achieve that the comparator comp spends approximately equal amount of time in either of the logical states , the point at which the comparator has the highest efficiency of detecting voltage variations .",
    "in other words , the duty cycle of the comparator comp would then on average be close to 0.5 .",
    "this is ensured by setting @xmath24 . if , for any reason , the duty cycle ever gets changed , the feedback network closed by comparator comp , operational amplifier opa and low - pass filter lp ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) will respond by changing the control current @xmath23 so that the duty cycle of 0.5 will be restored .",
    "this behavior effectively solves the requirement 2 .",
    "already here , at the output of the comparator comp , there is an approximately equal chance that the state is at logical `` 0 '' or at logical `` 1 '' , i.e. the bias of the sampled output would be close to zero .",
    "however , due to technical reasons it is quite difficult to keep the bias below 1/1000 for long term and even this would be not possible without some fine - tuning .",
    "tuning the bias consumes a lot of time ( due to its statistical nature ) and would therefore be unfavorable for a mass production of the generator . +",
    "present method for extracting random bits eliminates the need to tune the bias to zero value , and actually allows to achieve bias as low as desired , without the need to do any modifications to the circuit",
    ". + event counting is the crucial point of the method .",
    "namely , the jk - type flip - flop ( fig . [ fig1 ] ) performs a continued counting of the events , but keeps track only whether the count is even or odd .",
    "the result of the counting appears at the output q of the jk flip - flop and represents a new random bit sequence with highly suppressed bias and serial correlation . to understand how this works it is important to keep in mind that the output q of the jk flip - flop shall be sampled periodically in time",
    "this is a condition for good operation of this generator .",
    "the sampling is done by the d - type flip - flop .",
    "+ without the loss of generality , let us suppose that at the time zero ( @xmath25 ) the zener diode z exhibits a voltage breakdown .",
    "( voltage breakdown is only one of the processes that may cause fluctuations of the voltage across the diode that are manifested as noise . but to simplify the language we will refer to `` voltage breakdown '' as a synonym for a sudden positive jump of the voltage across the zener diode . )",
    "this causes the output of the comparator comp to exhibit a positive going transition ( and later a negative one ) .",
    "every such event triggers the jk flip - flop to reverse its state at the output q. this is illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ fig2].b and [ fig2].c .",
    "let us suppose that the voltage breakdowns happen at times @xmath26 = 0 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , etc .",
    "tiny intervals of time between neighboring voltage breakdowns @xmath31 where @xmath32 = 1 , 2 , 3 ... are distributed according to some statistical distribution .",
    "the mean value @xmath12 of duration of this tiny intervals is defined as : @xmath33    for example , in the pure quantum mechanical regime of the zener diode , intervals between neighboring voltage breakdowns @xmath34 follow the exponential distribution .",
    "mixing of the quantum mechanical model with the plasma noise , noise sources other than a zener diode or other models including effective memory and/or filtering of the noise signal prior to digitization , may lead to more centered distributions such as poisson or even uniform - like distribution .",
    "the power of this method lies in the fact that the knowledge of the actual distribution of the time intervals between neighboring voltage breakdowns is irrelevant .",
    "the only important thing is that the shape of the distribution stays stable over a period of time substantially larger than the sampling period @xmath35 .",
    "+ the method presented in this work consists in sampling ( i.e. reading out ) of the output q of the jk flip - flop periodically , at times @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and generally at times @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "the sampling is made by a d - type flip - flop ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "namely , when a positive - going edge of the sampling signal ( that is transition from `` 0 '' to `` 1 '' ) appears at the `` request '' input , state that is present at the input d gets sampled .",
    "sampled value is memorized ( frozen ) and displayed at the output q of the d - type flip - flop , and stays there until a new positive - going edge appears . according to the definition of the d - type flip - flop ,",
    "the sampling is done almost instantaneously so its output stays frozen for almost the whole sampling period @xmath35 which makes possible for other devices ( such as a computer ) to read it safely .",
    "+ let us now suppose that the sampling period @xmath35 is chosen large enough so that many voltage breakdowns occur during each sampling period . in another words , we suppose :",
    "@xmath40    this situation is illustrated in the fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] where several voltage breakdowns in the noise signal ( fig.2.a ) happen during any sampling period of length @xmath35 ( fig 2.d ) .",
    "furthermore , let us denote that the jk flip - flop changes its state at the output q : @xmath41 times from @xmath25 till @xmath42 , @xmath43 times from @xmath42 till @xmath44 , and generally @xmath45 times from @xmath46 , till @xmath47 , where @xmath48 .",
    "+ now we can conclude that every sampling period ( of length @xmath35 ) approximately equals the sum of many tiny intervals @xmath34 :    @xmath49    the above equalities hold only approximately because the first and the last of the tiny intervals in a given sum may be only partially happening during the respective sampling period @xmath35 . in such a case , a part of the first tiny interval may have actually happened during the previous period , while a part of the last tiny interval may have actually happened during the next period ( sum ) .",
    "however , approximation can be made arbitrarily good by setting the large enough sampling period @xmath35 .",
    "+ the central limit theorem of the statistics states that the sum of a large number ( say @xmath50 ) of independent random variables ( for example @xmath34 ) , which follow some ( any ) distribution , approaches normal distribution in the limit of large @xmath50 .",
    "this means that the statistical variable @xmath51 defined as : @xmath52    follows approximately the normal distribution for large @xmath50 .",
    "however , in our case , defined by equations ( [ eq : sums ] ) , the `` variable '' @xmath51 is fixed ( being just @xmath35 ) , and the relevant statistical random variable becomes the number of summands , @xmath50 defined as :    @xmath53    in the special case mentioned above , when the tiny intervals @xmath34 are distributed according to the exponential distribution , random variable @xmath50 follows , by definition , the poisson distribution :    @xmath54    quite generally ,",
    "regardless of the distribution function of tiny intervals @xmath34 , it can be shown @xcite that the integer random variable @xmath50 is distributed according to the binomial distribution @xmath55 , where @xmath56 quickly approaches 0.5 as @xmath57 tends to infinity .",
    "given the general expression for the binomial distribution :    @xmath58    distribution of the variable @xmath50 can be written as :    @xmath59    this is not in a contradiction with the previous result because the poisson distribution ( [ eq : poisson ] ) becomes equal to the binomial distribution ( [ eq : binom2 ] ) in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "+ even without a rigorous proof it is easy to understand why @xmath50 follows symmetric binomial distribution ( [ eq : binom2 ] ) in the limit of slow sampling or , equivalently , large @xmath50 .",
    "following eq .",
    "( [ eq : ndef ] ) , for large @xmath50 we can write : @xmath60 approximating the definition ( [ eq : inter ] ) with : @xmath61 to eliminate the sum in ( [ eq : xapprox ] ) we may conclude : @xmath62 since @xmath51 follows normal p.d.f .",
    "so should @xmath50 .",
    "but since @xmath50 is an integer number it actually follows a discrete version of the normal p.d.f . , i.e. symmetric binomial distribution with @xmath56=0.5 ,",
    "_ q.e.d_. this is a very important result because it means that ( [ eq : binom2 ] ) holds regardless of the distribution of tiny intervals @xmath34 .",
    "this solves the requirement 1 .",
    "+ it can be shown @xcite that as a special consequence of the equation ( [ eq : binom2 ] ) the probability that the random variable @xmath50 is even becomes equal to the probability that it is odd , in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "but , when the jk flip - flop changes its state an even number of times its output q returns to the initial state ( say `` 0 '' ) whereas when it changes an odd number of times it returns the complementary state ( say `` 1 '' ) .",
    "thus , in the limit of slow sampling , the probability of producing `` 0 '' would be equal to the probability of producing `` 1 '' at the output sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this fact can be expressed like this :    @xmath63    thus it has been shown that the generator and the corresponding method of sampling random phenomena solve the first problem stated in the section [ sect : method ] , i.e. that the bias should vanish in some limit .",
    "+ the second problem , namely the statistical independence of the logical states ( bits ) at the output of the generator , is solved as follows .",
    "first we realize that the subsequent voltage breakdowns in the zener diode are statistically independent because the breakdown itself is an unpredictable physical phenomenon . secondly , the internal capacitive memory that appears in the circuit ( which for example may be introduced by imperfections in electronics design , or be a part of physical process governing the alternate current noise source ) `` dies off '' exponentially with the half - life @xmath64 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) ) .",
    "effect of the memory on correlations can be made as small as desired in the limit of slow sampling , that is by making t/@xmath64 large enough .",
    "namely , in the limit @xmath65 sums of the type ( [ eq : sums ] ) become mutually statistically independent .",
    "the statistical independence of two subsequent sums , in that limit , takes place because the two sums contain large portion of summands that are `` out of the range '' of the memory effect of each other .",
    "if we consider two sums that are not subsequent , then the memory effects are even smaller .",
    "this means that a bit corresponding to a sum becomes statistically independent of neighboring and even more all other bits , in the limit of slow sampling .",
    "it can be concluded that the generator and the corresponding method of sampling random phenomena also solve the second problem stated in the section [ sect : method ] .",
    "+ functioning of the whole circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] can be best understood by looking at signals shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig2]a - e .",
    "one can see that with each positive - going edge at the output of the comparator comp ( fig .",
    "[ fig2].b ) , the jk flip - flop changes state at its output q ( fig .",
    "[ fig2].c ) .",
    "the sampling signal ( fig .",
    "[ fig2].d ) is nt , of course , in any synchronization with these signals .",
    "whenever it exhibits a positive - going transition , the output q of the jk flip - flop gets sampled and the state thus obtained is the output bit from the generator ( fig .",
    "[ fig2].e ) .",
    "+ it is important to understand that the output q of the jk flip - flop always produces `` 1 '' after `` 0 '' and `` 0 '' after `` 1 '' , therefore its output is not random at all . however",
    "a duration of zeros and ones varies randomly ( fig . [ fig2]c ) and periodic sampling of the said output by the d - type flip - flop provides a good quality random bits , in the limit of slow sampling ( @xmath13 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "[ sect : simulation ]    in order to check the theory of operation described above , a series of simulations of the circuit in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] were made .",
    "simulations should provide an insight on how the type of distribution of tiny intervals between subsequent physical events and ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 influence the quality of generated bits .",
    "the circuit was simulated by a specifically designed computer program which simulates a random digital signal obeying a specified distribution which would be present at the output of the comparator comp , and assuming that this signal gets processed by ideal flip - flops .",
    "the approximation of considering the two flip - flops to be ideal is very good because their fall and rise times ( of approximately 7 nanoseconds ) are much shorter than the changes in the noise being processed . +",
    "two distributions of tiny intervals were simulated : exponential and uniform .",
    "exponential distribution is natural distribution for many processes .",
    "uniform distribution assumes that the intervals between physical events may be between zero and 1 ( in arbitrary time units , for example microseconds ) and evenly distributed between the two limits .",
    "the two distributions are chosen because they are very different : for example exponential d. is completely non - symmetric and peaked at one value ( zero ) whereas uniform d. is symmetric and has no peak , etc .",
    "most processes should obey distributions that are somewhere between those two extremes .",
    "+ the effect of memory was simulated as a pile up : any two breakdowns closer ( in time ) than @xmath64 were considered as being just one breakdown happening at the end of the last breakdown .",
    "this in effect may chain up more than two events to be seen as one .",
    "this is a very faithful model for a noise source which we use , and a reasonable approximation for any other noise source because memory ( by definition ) always piles up events in a way that events which happen to close to one another get piled up and be detected as just one event .",
    "+ the method for extracting bits does not prefer zeros nor ones , therefore we do not expect the bias to be significant even in the case when both ratios @xmath67 and @xmath68 are small .",
    "what happens however is that when sampling is being made too fast there is an excess of longer patterns of ones or zeros .",
    "this in turn means that the probability of single ones ( pattern `` 010 '' ) a well as that of single zeros ( pattern `` 101 '' ) will be smaller than expected ( expected vales are : @xmath69 ) . + for each choice of distribution , ratio @xmath67 and ratio @xmath70 , the program calculates ( by simulation ) three output values : probability of ones @xmath8 , probability of single ones @xmath71 and serial correlation coefficient @xmath72 .",
