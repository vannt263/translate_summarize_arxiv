    "cosmological inflationary models are usually described by the evolution of a background scalar field , the inflaton .",
    "these models can be separated in terms of isentropic ( cold ) @xcite and nonisentropic ( warm ) @xcite expansion ( for earlier related work see @xcite ) , when regarding the production of radiation during the inflation phase . in cold inflation ( ci ) , the couplings of the inflaton field to other field degrees of freedom are considered not to influence the inflaton dynamics in any appreciable way , becoming only relevant at the end of inflation , at the time of reheating . as such , in cold inflation dynamics , during inflation the universe undergoes a stage of supercooling .",
    "in contrast for warm inflation ( wi ) , the interactions of the inflaton field with other field degrees of freedom are strong enough to lead to radiation production at a rate that can eventually compensate the supercooling due to expansion .",
    "this will lead to some general statistical state during inflation .",
    "the analysis of the quantum dynamics of inflationary models is done using the effective action with the in - in schwinger closed - time path ( or schwinger - keldysh ) method  @xcite .",
    "this approach has been used for the study of the quantum dynamics of warm inflation since its early implementations  @xcite .",
    "a review of these quantum field theory methods applied to warm inflation can be found e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the context of cold inflation ,",
    "the schwinger - keldysh method is also commonly used and one primary modification it makes to the tree level theory is to add time local corrections to the effective potential due to radiative effects .",
    "another modification that can be studied by this method is the growth of long wavelength quantum fluctuations and their effect on the evolution of the inflaton background and fluctuation modes  @xcite .",
    "warm inflation models are those in which significant time nonlocal contributions also arise from the effective action .",
    "main consequences of such terms will be dissipation and fluctuation effects  @xcite . this can very generally lead to a vast variety of particle production behavior during inflation , thus to various types of statistical states . amongst all of these ,",
    "the one case which can be studied most extensively by quantum field theory methods is the case where the statistical state of the universe emerging from these effects is near thermal equilibrium .",
    "once particle production occurs during inflation , there are many effects that can follow and it is a complicated problem .",
    "this is why it is essential to understand the properties of warm inflation in the near thermal equilibrium regime , so as to provide insight into the features that one should also expect when away from this limit .",
    "of late there have been some efforts to understand warm inflation models away from thermal equilibrium @xcite .",
    "these papers have analyzed some of the effects that emerge in the presence of particle production , but they are at a much more primary level then the extensive study for the near thermal equilibrium regime . in particular , creating a radiation bath of particles will also then modify the inflaton potential no matter what statistical state it is in .",
    "also the nature of the radiation bath of particles will alter and modify the density perturbations . in the thermal limit",
    "there are well established methods for examining all these effects , whereas away from this limit it is a much more difficult problem .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the case that has been studied most extensively , since it is the most tractable by quantum field theory methods , is when the radiation has adequate time to reach close to a thermal state . for this case ,",
    "the radiation production during inflation manifests itself through an effective dissipation term in the inflaton background equation .",
    "the corresponding dissipative coefficient can be computed from first principles in quantum field theory under appropriate conditions ( see e.g. refs .",
    "in particular , the two - stage interaction configuration for quantum fields proposed in @xcite , has been shown can lead to a large enough dissipative terms , while keeping the quantum corrections to the inflationary potential under control and allowing a period of slow - roll inflation  @xcite .    in wi ,",
    "the transfer of energy of the inflaton field to the radiation bath is mediated by the dissipation term in the inflaton s evolution equation .",
    "nevertheless , an additional effect can arise due to inner couplings in the radiation fluid itself .",
    "internal decays within the radiation fluid can make it depart slightly from thermal equilibrium .",
    "therefore , the radiation fluid can behave as a non - ideal fluid and viscosity effects must be taken into account  @xcite . at the background level , the relevant viscous effect is due to bulk pressure , since it is the only viscous effect appearing in the background equations for an frw universe .",
    "the study of bulk viscous effects in cosmology , and in particular in inflation , has some history to it , focused mainly on the effect of the bulk pressure as a negative pressure ( for a partial sample of the earlier works on bulk viscous cosmologies , see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition , more recently , there has been a surge of interest in exploring the effects of the bulk pressure as the origin of the present accelerated expansion of the universe ( see e.g. refs .",
    "almost all of these past works only use phenomenological forms for the bulk viscosity .",
    "this paper differs from these past works since we will apply first principle quantum field theory computed expressions for the bulk viscosity , based on the calculations found e.g. in ref .",
    "@xcite , to warm inflation .",
    "there has been very little work done in studying first principles bulk viscosity expressions in application to cosmology .",
    "there is one paper we are aware of along these lines , which is the first reference in @xcite ; this paper uses quantum field theory derived expressions of bulk viscosity and shows how they can play the role similar to dark energy",
    ".    our work will examine the consequences of bulk viscosity on warm inflationary dynamics .",
    "in particular we are interested in determining the stability conditions of the background equations of warm inflation when coupled to the bulk viscous radiation bath .",
    "earlier studies examining the stability properties of the warm inflation equations include refs .",
    "@xcite , but these studies did not include the effects of bulk viscous pressure .",
    "preliminary studies on the inclusion of bulk viscous pressure have been done in @xcite,@xcite , where only the non - causal theory of eckart @xcite has been used . here",
    "we extend the stability analysis of the dynamical warm inflation equations to include bulk viscous effects .",
    "moreover our analysis will be done not just for the non - causal eckart theory @xcite but also the causal theories of bulk pressure @xcite , with a full analysis of the differences in the resulting dynamics from these different theories .    in the study of viscous effects in cosmology",
    "it is common to use linear expressions to describe the viscous pressure , where it is assumed that the deviations are close to equilibrium .",
    "however , the viscous pressure can , in principle , take the system far from its thermodynamical equilibrium , so , we must apply suitable approaches in order to see if one really needs to use a more robust description , incorporating nonlinear effects .",
    "we consider here three different theories to describe the viscous pressure : the non - causal theory due to eckart @xcite , the linear and causal theory of israel - stewart  @xcite and finally we will also use a recent causal and nonlinear theory proposed by the authors in @xcite , named by them _ nonlinear causal dissipative hydrodynamics _ ( nlcdh ) .",
    "there have been other proposals for a nonlinear theory for the bulk viscous pressure @xcite , that make use of ad - hoc parameters , such as the time where nonlinear effects become important @xcite or functions @xcite that do not have an immediate interpretation from quantum field theory , for example being a relaxation time . in using such approaches there is no immediate understanding how to associate their parameters with first principles parameters .",
    "we have considered the theory for bulk pressure in @xcite since it utilizes parameters which can readily be determined from microscopic physics , in particular from quantum field theory .",
    "the theories for the bulk pressure we analyze here are more natural to use in field theory model building , where the dissipation terms , viscosity coefficients and relaxation times are well defined and can be reliably computed once a specific field theory model is given .",
    "we study the effects of the inclusion of bulk viscosity in three commonly used supersymmetric realizations of warm inflation , the chaotic , hybrid and hilltop models . as the bulk viscosity modifies the background dynamics of warm inflation",
    ", it also changes the available parameter space for warm inflation , which is analyzed here .",
    "the bulk viscosity is approximated by the eckart description and we place limits on the couplings of the underlying particle physics theory for the validity of this approximation .",

    "in the warm inflation scenario , the inflaton evolution is described in terms of a dissipative equation of motion of the form  @xcite    @xmath0    where @xmath1 is the dissipative coefficient , @xmath2 is the field derivative of the ( field and temperature dependent ) effective potential , @xmath3 is the hubble rate of expansion , and @xmath4 the scale factor of the friedmann - robertson - walker background metric , @xmath5 .    the dissipation term in eq . ( [ eominf ] )",
    "originates from the interactions of the inflaton field with other fields .",
    "these interactions effectively render the inflaton as an open system , which necessarily should give origin to dissipation . the dissipation coefficient @xmath1 accounts for this effective dissipation of the inflaton and , given a particle physics model realization of inflation ,",
    "it can be computed microscopically ( see e.g. the recent review  @xcite and references there in ) . if enough dissipation , _",
    "i.e. _ , radiation , can be produced during the inflationary regime , it can eventually compensate the redshift of the radiation due to expansion . when this happens , we then term the inflationary regime as warm inflation .",
    "a particular field theory model that has been proved successful in generating the wi conditions is the two - stage mechanism  @xcite . in the two - stage mechanism , the inflaton field couples to a heavy catalyst field , and the latter in turn couples to light degrees of freedom .",
    "the evolution of the background inflaton field excites the catalyst fields , which then decay into light fields .",
    "large dissipation has been demonstrated with this simple mechanism , adequate to drive a warm inflationary expansion .",
    "when the produced light relativistic particles thermalize , which is achieved when their creation and scattering times are less than the hubble time in an expanding universe , we can model their contribution as that of radiation ,    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the temperature of the thermal bath , and @xmath8 the effective number of light degrees of freedom , the effective no . of degrees of freedom for the minimal supersymmetric standard model , when presenting numerical results . ] .",
    "bulk viscous effects come in to play when the light particles in the resulting radiation bath in warm inflation can also decay , thus making the radiation fluid slightly depart from equilibrium .",
    "this effectively renders the radiation as a nonideal fluid and gives origin to a bulk viscous pressure ( there may be other dissipative effects in the radiation fluid itself , like shear viscous stresses , but these do not contribute at the background level  @xcite , though they may be relevant in the determination of the spectrum of density perturbations , as demonstrated recently  @xcite ) . in the presence of a bulk viscous pressure , @xmath9 , the stress - energy tensor for the radiation fluid",

    "it is also useful to express this in terms of the entropy density @xmath20 . from the helmholtz free energy @xmath21 , where @xmath22 , and using @xmath23 ,",

    "using also that @xmath30 and that the entropy density @xmath20 is related to the radiation energy density by @xmath31 , eq .",
    "( [ eomrad ] ) can then be written in terms of the entropy density as    @xmath32    where we have used @xmath33 , which is valid for a quasi - equilibrium high temperature thermal bath typical of warm inflation .    from eq .",
    "( [ eoms ] ) , the dynamical effects of the bulk viscosity can be easily read .",
    "given that the bulk viscous pressure @xmath9 is negative , it acts to decrease the radiation pressure , thus enhancing the effect from the source term on the rhs in the equation for the entropy density . as a consequence , the entropy density increases , and therefore the radiation energy density also grows . on the one hand , if this bulk pressure term is too large , there is too much radiation production and the radiation energy density dominates too soon over the scalar field energy density , thus spoiling inflation .",
    "this regime is called the _ unstable regime_. on the other hand , if the bulk pressure term is controlled to avoid the radiation domination until the end of inflation , the system is said to be in the _",
    "stable regime_. in this regime the bulk viscosity gives rise to an additional negative pressure , and hence , inflation is enhanced .    to account for the dynamics involving the bulk viscous pressure @xmath9 , as explained in the introduction",
    ", we will consider three different theories : the noncausal theory due to eckart  @xcite , the linear and causal theory of israel - stewart ( is )  @xcite , and a recent causal and nonlinear theory , _ nonlinear causal dissipative hydrodynamics _",

    "we have only focused on the background evolution and so these observational details are not directly relevant .",
    "a detailed study of the primordial spectrum , that includes dissipation and viscous effects and the observational consequences , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the goal of this section is to study the parameter space of these basic inflation models in the presence of bulk viscosity .    as discussed in previous sections ,",
    "the bulk viscous pressure decreases the radiation pressure and so allows the source term creating radiation to be more effective .",
    "thus assuming thermalization , it raises the temperature .",
    "given that the dissipative coefficient depends on the temperature , the bulk viscosity enhances it ; and therefore , the inflaton can slow - roll down its potential with lower values of the dissipative factor @xmath234 .",

    "this condition roughly separates warm inflation from cold inflation , since for @xmath243 dissipation effects are negligible .",
    "we also must take into account the thermodynamical condition @xmath244 , as the hydrodynamic descriptions of the bulk viscosity that we are using treat the viscous pressure as a perturbation to the equilibrium one .",

    "the ratio @xmath256 decreases , but we have checked that it always remains above @xmath281 as long as the other conditions are fulfilled .",

    "<S> the effects of bulk viscosity are examined for inflationary dynamics in which dissipation and thermalization are present . </S>",
    "<S> a complete stability analysis is done for the background inflaton evolution equations , which includes both inflaton dissipation and radiation bulk viscous effects . </S>",
    "<S> three representative approaches of bulk viscous irreversible thermodynamics are analyzed : the eckart noncausal theory , the linear and causal theory of israel - stewart and a more recent nonlinear and causal bulk viscous theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the causal theories allow for larger bulk viscosities before encountering an instability in comparison to the noncausal eckart theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the causal theories tend to suppress the radiation production due to bulk viscous pressure , because of the presence of relaxation effects implicit in these theories . </S>",
    "<S> bulk viscosity coefficients derived from quantum field theory are applied to warm inflation model building and an analysis is made of the effects to the duration of inflation . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment of bulk pressure would also be relevant to the reheating phase after inflation in cold inflation dynamics and during the radiation dominated regime , although very little work in both areas has been done ; the methodology developed in this paper could be extended to apply to these other problems . </S>"
