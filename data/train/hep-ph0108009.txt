    "there are two first - principles methods to obtain the equation of state : perturbation theory and lattice simulations .",
    "only lattice gauge theory techniques are able to determine the equation of state directly over all temperatures but researchers in other fields have typically contented themselves with the extraction of a few important parameters from lattice results . when the equation of state is needed , the bag model equation of state @xcite is very often used , even though it is a poor representation of lattice results .    as better alternatives , we have developed two simple models for the @xmath0 gluon plasma equation of state .",
    "both models are obtained by combining simple phenomenological ideas with @xmath11  symmetry and the known features of the perturbative equation of state .",
    "these models have many desirable properties , and exhibit thermodynamic behavior similar to that obtained from lattice simulations .",
    "in particular , they give a reasonable picture of the crucial region from the deconfinement temperature @xmath12 to @xmath13 which has not been obtained by other means .",
    "the phase transition in these models is second order for @xmath2 , and first order for @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 .",
    "it appears that the large-@xmath14 limit will be smooth in both models .",
    "quark effects are easily included .    in both models , the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop",
    "determine all thermodynamic properties .",
    "the polyakov loop is defined for euclidean finite temperature gauge theories as @xmath15\\ ] ] where @xmath16is the temperature , and @xmath17 denotes euclidean time ordering .",
    "the polyakov loop is is the natural order parameter of the deconfinement transition in pure gauge theories .",
    "its trace in the fundamental representation can be related to the free energy @xmath18  of a heavy source : @xmath19 where the expectation value is taken over a thermal ensemble of states .",
    "it has been known for some time that @xmath20 is of fundamental importance in describing the deconfining phase transition @xcite . in a pure gauge theory , the action is invariant under a global symmetry associated with the center @xmath21 of the gauge group , but the polyakov loop is not invariant .",
    "if @xmath22 , then the symmetry requires @xmath23 , which implies @xmath24 .",
    "this is in turn interpreted as @xmath25 , indicating confinement . in the phenomenological models developed here , the eigenvalues of the polyakov loop are the essential degrees of freedom rather than @xmath20 alone , a possibility also recently explored by pisarski @xcite .",
    "the polyakov loop @xmath26 is unitary for @xmath27 gauge theories ; we will denote its eigenvalues in the fundmental representation by @xmath28 after a diagonalizing unitary transformation .",
    "the eigenvalues in other representations will be linear combinations of the phase factors @xmath29 .",
    "for simplicity , we will refer to both @xmath29 and @xmath30 as eigenvalues , relying on context to differentiate them .    in our models",
    ", we make a mean - field assumption that the polyakov loop eigenvalues are constant throughout space , and assume that the free energy @xmath31 is a function of the eigenvalues .",
    "confinement is obtained from a set of eigenvalues which make @xmath32 . as we show below , this",
    "is naturally obtained by a uniform distribution of eigenvalues around the unit circle , constrained by the unitary of @xmath26 . in other words , confinement at low temperatures is a consequence of eigenvalue repulsion . in a pure gauge theory below the deconfinement temperature @xmath12 , the eigenvalues are frozen in this uniform distribution . as @xmath33 moves upward from @xmath34 ,",

    ", the eigenvalues jump at @xmath37 . in the models developed below , it is this motion of the eigenvalues which is responsible for the approach to the blackbody limit over the range @xmath38 .    the next section briefly derives the conventional one - loop expression for the free energy of gluons in a constant polyakov loop background . using this expression ,",
    "section  [ sec : landau ] explains in detail why a naive landau - ginsberg treatment of deconfinement based on @xmath39 as a single complex order parameter fails for @xmath40 and higher .",

    "section  [ sec : quarks ] considers the effects of massive and light quarks in model a for @xmath9 .",
    "a final section discusses our results .",
    "there are several reasons for beginning with the perturbative expression for the free energy . as a consequence of asymptotic freedom , the perturbative expression for the free energy as a function of the polyakov loop eigenvalues will be valid at sufficiently high temperatures",
    ". any purely perturbative calculation will give a free energy of the form @xmath46 where @xmath18 depends directly only on dimensionless variables : the polyakov loop @xmath26 and the running coupling constant @xmath47 .",
    "the leading order behavior , which is sufficient for our needs , is independent of @xmath47 and gives the blackbody behavior expected at high temperature .",
    "in addition , the perturbative expression for the free energy will give us significant insights into the structure and interpretation of possible terms in the free energy .",
    "at one loop , the free energy for gluons in a constant @xmath48 background can be written as @xmath49\\ ] ] where @xmath50 is the covariant derivative acting on fields in the adjoint representation .",
    "this can be written in an unregularized form as @xmath51\\ ] ] where the trace is in the adjoint representation and @xmath52 . using a standard identity @xcite ,",
    "this can be written in a familiar form as the sum of a zero - temperature contribution , which is divergent , and a finite temperature contribution : @xmath53 \\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 and the factor of @xmath55 comes from the sum over polarization states .",
    "disregarding the zero temperature contribution , the free energy density can be written as @xmath56\\ ] ] where the factor involving the kronecker @xmath57 projects out the singlet state .",
    "we have defined the differences of the fundamental representation eigenvalues as @xmath58 @xmath59 ; they are just the @xmath60 eigenvalues in the adjoint representation .",
    "it is instructive to expand the logarithm : @xmath61 each factor of @xmath62 is associated with paths that wrap around space - time @xmath63times in the euclidean time direction @xcite .",

    "this leads immediately to @xcite @xmath71\\ ] ] which reduces to the usual black body formula in the case @xmath72 .",
    "the free energy is a smooth polynomial in the @xmath73 variables , except at the points @xmath74 where the @xmath75 function acts to maintain the periodicity which is manifest in the original form of @xmath76 .",
    "the minimum of @xmath76 occurs at @xmath72 and values related to @xmath72 by @xmath11 symmetries for all values of the temperature @xmath33 .",
    "we can characterize these solutions as @xmath77 the one - loop expression for the free energy of gluons propagating in the background of a non - trivial , but constant , polyakov loop thus predicts a gas of gluons would always be in the deconfined phase .",
    "there is no indication that higher orders in perturbation theory modify this result @xcite .",
    "we define @xmath78 to be the expectation value of the trace of the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation , @xmath20 . because @xmath78 is the order parameter for the deconfining phase transition in pure gauge theories , it is natural to attempt to construct a landau theory for the deconfining phase transition as a polynomial in @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "an obvious form for the landau free energy @xmath79 is @xmath80 where the coefficients are all real and temperature - dependent .",
    "most of the terms in @xmath79 are invariant under a @xmath81 symmetry @xmath82 .",
    "the term @xmath83 breaks this symmetry down to @xmath11 , the correct symmetry group for the @xmath0 deconfining transition .",
    "an exception occurs for @xmath41 : @xmath78 is real , so the @xmath84 term can be absorbed into @xmath85 , and @xmath79 has only a @xmath86 invariance .",
    "while additional terms can be added to @xmath79 , this is the minimal form necessary to reproduce all known behavior in @xmath87 dimensions .",
    "models of the lattice @xmath0 deconfinement transition valid in the strong - coupling limit indicate a first - order transition for all @xmath88 @xcite ; there is also an argument based on schwinger - dyson equations that the @xmath89 limit also has a first - order transition @xcite .",
    "recent lattice simulations of @xmath40 at finite temperature provide very good evidence that the @xmath40 transitition is first order @xcite .",
    "the deconfining @xmath0 gauge transition can be first order for all @xmath88 with the simple landau free energy @xmath79 only if the coefficients are carefully chosen functions of the temperature . in the large @xmath14 limit",
    ", these coefficients must scale in such a way that @xmath90 .",
    "there are several problems associated with using @xmath79 to obtain an equation of state over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "first , there are generally at least four unknown coefficients to be determined . because @xmath78 is dimensionless , the coefficients are all of dimension four in @xmath87 dimensions .",
    "we can safely assume that they grow no quicker than @xmath91 for large @xmath33 , in accord with the usual black body behavior .",
    "the standard landau assumption would be that each coefficient is a polynomial in @xmath33 of degree four or less .",
    "this gives us generically @xmath92 undetermined parameters . without additional assumptions ,",
    "it is impossible to make useful progress .",
    "secondly , this form of the free energy includes only part of the known high - temperature physics .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , the high - temperature partition function depends on terms of the form @xmath93 where @xmath62 can be associated with a gluon trajectory winding around space - time @xmath62 times in the temporal direction . because @xmath94 , the @xmath85 term is associated with the @xmath95 gluon trajectories , and so on .",
    "we see that a polynomial in @xmath78 does not take into account all of the high - temperature perturbative result .",
    "finally , the most general form of the free energy does not depend on @xmath96solely through @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "the high - temperature perturbative free energy @xmath76 illustrates this point .",
    "it is not a function solely of @xmath78 and its conjugate , and can not be written as an infinite series in @xmath78 and @xmath99 .",
    "a simple example will illustrate this point . consider two diagonal matrices lying in @xmath40 , defined by @xmath100    and @xmath101 both @xmath102 and @xmath103 have zero trace in the fundamental representation , yet",
    "the traces of their square are differenct : @xmath104 and @xmath105 , establishing that @xmath106 can not be a function solely of @xmath107 .",
    "explicit calculation shows furthermore that @xmath108 .    at first sight",
    ", this may seem to contradict two standard results : a ) the characters form a complete , in fact orthogonal , basis on class functions ; b ) all characters may be obtained from the fundamental representation by repeated multiplication and the application of @xmath109 where all @xmath62 s are non - negative integers .",
    "taken together , these results might suggest that all group characters are polynomials in @xmath110 and its complex conjugate .",
    "consider , however , the product representation @xmath111 .",
    "it is reducible into @xmath112 , which are symmetric and antisymmetric representations , respectively .",
    "their characters are respectively @xmath113 \\nonumber\\\\ \\chi _ { a } & = & \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\left ( tr_{f}u\\right ) ^{2}-tr_{f}\\left ( u^{2}\\right ) \\right ] \\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that the sum @xmath114 is a polynomial in @xmath110 , but @xmath115 and @xmath116 are in general not .",
    "for example , in @xmath9 the restriction on the eigenvalues of @xmath117 imposed by @xmath118 allows us to prove @xmath119 = tr_{f}\\left ( u^{\\dagger}\\right)\\ ] ] in accord with the @xmath9 result @xmath120 . in this case , it is true that @xmath121 can be written as a polynomial in @xmath110 and @xmath122 .",
    "however , for @xmath40 , unitarity of @xmath117 gives instead @xmath119 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left [ \\left ( tr_{f}u\\right ) ^{2}-tr_{f}\\left ( u^{2}\\right ) \\right ] ^{\\ast } \\ ] ] which shows that the @xmath123 representation of @xmath40 is real .",
    "@xmath0 @xmath124group characters can be written as polynomials in @xmath125 and its complex conjugate only for @xmath41 and @xmath9 .",
    "an alternative statement is that the polyakov loop in the fundamental representation , @xmath110 , is not sufficient to determine the eigenvalues of @xmath117 , beginning with the case of @xmath40 .",
    "let us label the eigenvalues for the polyakov loop as @xmath126 , with @xmath127 to @xmath14 . for @xmath9 ,",
    "the characteristic polynomial for the polyakov loop is @xmath128 since the determinant of a special unitary matrix is @xmath8 , we have @xmath129 , and the characteristic polynomial is @xmath130 so for @xmath9 , knowledge of @xmath110 determines all eigenvalues , and the free energy can be written as a function of @xmath110 alone . for @xmath40 ,",
    "similar considerations allow the characteristic polynomial to be written as @xmath131 -ztr_{f}u^{+}+1\\ ] ] and knowledge of @xmath110 must be supplemented by the value of @xmath132 . as @xmath14 increases , more information must be supplied to reconstruct the eigenvalues .",
    "we want to add terms to @xmath76 which are subleading in comparison to the @xmath91 behavior of @xmath76 , and introduce a mass scale into @xmath31 .",
    "this mass scale will determine the deconfinement temperature @xmath133 .",
    "the first of our two models is obtained by adding , by hand , a mass to the gauge bosons , and working with the high temperature expansion of the resultant free energy .",
    "as before , we have @xmath134 but now @xmath135 .",
    "it is easy to derive the first two terms in the high - temperature expansion .",
    "higher order effects , which include terms of order @xmath136 and @xmath137 , can be derived by more sophisticated methods .",
    "such terms were derived in the case of a trivial polyakov loop by dolan and jackiw @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a relatively simple derivation of the general case .",
    "the result is @xmath138\\ ] ] where the second bernoulli polynomial @xmath139 is given by @xmath140 on the interval @xmath141 .",
    "the above expression _ defines _ the free energy for our model a. in fact , the full one - loop free energy for a massive gluon always favors @xmath72 .",
    "we stress that we view this derivation as merely providing an indication of the type of additional terms that might appear in the complete free energy .",
    "the bernoulli polynomials appear naturally in class functions which are almost everywhere polynomials in the @xmath142 s ; these class functions are thus well - suited for the construction of a landau theory in the eigenvalues . in more explicit form , @xmath143 is given by    @xmath144 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + t^{2}m^{2}\\sum_{j , k=1}^{n}(1-\\frac{1}{n}\\delta _",

    "this important property will also hold for model b.    the @xmath91 term has a clear minimum when @xmath146 , corresponding to @xmath72 and its @xmath11 equivalents , and will dominate for large @xmath33 .",

    "this line of first - order critical points in the @xmath228 plane is expected to terminate in a second - order end point at some finite value of @xmath227 .",
    "a low - temperature expansion @xcite gives the free energy of a massive quark as @xmath229 a form suitable for @xmath230 sufficiently large .",
    "we consider only the simple case of @xmath9 using model a with a single heavy quark . taking the parameter @xmath231",
    ", the deconfinement temperature in the pure gauge theory is @xmath232 .",
    "the addition of a single heavy quark shifts the deconfinement temperature very slightly , with the first - order line terminating at a quark mass of @xmath233 . at this critical end point ,",
    "the deconfinement temperature is @xmath234 .    for light quarks ,",
    "the leading order behavior is proportional to @xmath91 and independent of the quark mass , and therefore independent of chiral behavior .",
    "it is given by @xcite @xmath235 where @xmath236 denotes the number of light flavors .",
    "recall that the confined phase of the pure gauge theory was given by @xmath169 .",
    "the term linear in @xmath237appearing in @xmath238directly indicates the breaking of the @xmath239 invariance of the pure gauge theory .",
    "detailed analysis shows that with @xmath240 , the deconfinement transition is replaced by a smooth crossover .",
    "the only scale in this model is again the parameter @xmath241 , which need not have the same value found in the pure gauge theory , and a rapid rise in all thermodynamic quantities begins at a temperature around @xmath242 .",
    "we have developed two phenomenological equations of state for the quark - gluon plasma , which reproduce much of the thermodynamic behavior seen in lattice simulations .",
    "these models have many attractive features .",
    "not the least of these is simplicity .",
    "both models introduce a single new parameter . for the most important case of @xmath9 ,",
    "the free energy is obtained by minimizing over a single variable . both models",
    "correctly predict the order of the deconfining phase transitions for @xmath41 ( second order ) and @xmath9 ( weakly first order ) .",
    "both models predict first order transitions in @xmath40 and @xmath214 as well .",
    "the pressure and other thermodynamic quantities vary rapidly in the range @xmath1 in both models , and both appear to have smooth large @xmath14 limits .",
    "although the two models have very different phenomenological origins , the numerical value of the parameters introduced are reasonable for the case of @xmath243 .",
    "if we take the deconfinement temperature in a pure @xmath9 gauge theory to be @xmath244 , then model a gives a value for @xmath241 of @xmath245 .",
    "this is a plausible value for a constituent gluon mass . in model b , we find that @xmath246is @xmath247fermi , which is of course a typical hadronic scale .",
    "thus in both models the phenomenological parameter introduced has a reasonable value .",
    "it is useful to compare these models to the naive bag model equation of state , which is in common usage in phenomenological applications @xcite .",
    "the bag model also introduces a single dimensional parameter , the bag energy density @xmath248 , but gives a first order transition for all @xmath14 .",
    "the bag model pressure approaches the high - temperature , blackbody limit faster than both model a and model b , and also lattice results .",
    "the graph of @xmath249 versus @xmath16for the bag model is monotonically decreasing , in complete disagreement with lattice results .",
    "finally , the bag model predicts a @xmath250 behavior for @xmath44 , which is ruled out by lattice results . as we have seen , model a and model b",
    "both show a @xmath178 behavior in @xmath44 , which is compatible with @xmath9 lattice data .    as we have formulated them , both model a and model b have no free parameters once @xmath12 is fixed .",
    "it is clear that by allowing the parameters @xmath241 and @xmath251 to depend on the temperature , a better fit to lattice data can be obtained at the cost of introducing additional phenomenological parameters .",
    "we plan to explore this issue for the most important case of @xmath9 .",
    "the success of these phenomenological models strongly suggests a theoretical point of view on the nature of the deconfinement mechanism , independent of the specific gauge theory under study . in confining theories , such as pure gauge theories ,",
    "the eigenvalue distributions of the polyakov loop are peaked at low temperature around values evenly spaced about the unit circle in such a way that the expectation value of the polyakov loop is zero .",
    "such behavior is characteristic of random @xmath252matrices . at the deconfining transition temperature , the peaks of the eigenvalue distributions change , and move towards @xmath8 , which is the asymptotic limit as @xmath33 goes to infinity .",
    "the consistency of this picture can be tested using lattice polyakov loop eigenvalue distributions for @xmath40 and higher . in theories with light quarks , the deconfinement transition may be replaced by a rapid crossover , which is again associated with the motion of the polyakov loop eigenvalues .",
    "we believe that this picture of deconfinement coupled with a field - theory inspired model of chiral symmetry breaking has the potential to fully model the equation of state of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "associating deconfinement with changes in polyakov loop eigenvalue distributions gives some perspective on recent attempts to model the plasma equation of state using the hard thermal loop ( htl )  approximation @xcite .",
    "the htl approximation is a resummation of high - temperature perturbation theory , and may provide a good explanation of the slow asymptotic approach to the blackbody limit at very high temperatures .",
    "however , if the picture we have advocated here is correct , then no approach based on perturbation theory can explain the behavior of the plasma in the crucial region from @xmath12 to @xmath253 , because the polyakov loop eigenvalues are assumed to be @xmath8 .",
    "in fact , preliminary numerical simulations of pure @xmath9 gauge theories using @xmath254 lattices indicate that the eigenvalues of individual polyakov loops move much more slowly towards @xmath247than either model predicts .",
    "it is possible that a hybrid approach combining hard thermal loops with the minimal amount of phenomenology used in our models would be quite successful in reproducing the quark - gluon plasma thermodynamics over the entire range of temperatures above @xmath12 .",
    "finally , there is the question of the connection of these models to candidate explanations for confinement having a deeper basis in the underlying gauge theory dynamics .",
    "both model a and model b attribute confinement to a single , simple term in the free energy .",
    "derivation of a similar term from one of these more fundamental candidate explanations of confinement would be very satisfying . a proper field - theoretic basis for the motion of the polyakov loop eigenvalues would answer many questions .",
