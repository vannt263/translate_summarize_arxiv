    "the hubble diagram of type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) observed at the end of 90 s was hard to reconcile with the decelerated trend implied by the einstein - de sitter model , then suggesting an accelerated expansion of the universe@xcite . in the following decade , both sne ",
    "ia @xcite and other cosmological probes , such as the cosmic microwave background ( cmb)@xcite , galaxy clusters and baryonic acoustic oscillations ( bao)@xcite lent further support to the existence of an unknown form of `` dark energy '' propelling the acceleration . the equation of state of such dark energy",
    "is often expressed as @xmath4 , where @xmath5.@xcite    after combining sne data with flat universe constraints from cmb measurements @xcite , riess et al .",
    "( 2004)@xcite found @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath9 .",
    "these results identified the `` dark energy '' with the cosmological constant .",
    "however , one main issue ( among the others ) remains still unsolved : a cosmological constant interpreted as a vacuum energy is about 120 orders of magnitude smaller than its natural value computed from quantum mechanics .",
    "@xcite this fact justifies a lot of interest in models where the present energy density ( or a dominant fraction of it ) is slowly varying with time .    in this short review",
    "we show that gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) can significantly contribute to shedding some light on this last issue . due to their huge energetic outputs ,",
    "up to @xmath010@xmath1 erg in terms of equivalent isotropically radiated energies , released in a few tens or hundreds of seconds ( fig .  1 ) , grbs are the brightest cosmological sources in the universe .",
    "@xcite therefore , they have been observed up to @xmath10 @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) , well beyond the observing redshift range of sne  ia , limited to @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite in addition , grbs emit most of their radiation as hard x - rays , thus they are only marginally affected by uncertainties connected with correction for reddening.@xcite in recent years it has been shown @xcite that the robust correlation between the photon energy at which the spectrum peaks and the grb radiated energy @xcite can be successfully used to measure the cosmological density parameter .",
    "the spectrum of grbs is nonthermal and can be empirically described by the so - called band function , i.e. , a smoothly broken power law characterized by three parameters : the low - energy spectral index @xmath12 , the high energy spectral index @xmath13 and the `` rollover '' energy .@xcite as can be seen in fig .  2",
    ", the spectrum shows a peak ; the photon energy at which this peak occurs is a characteristic quantity in grb emission models and is called the  peak energy \" .",
    "every grb for which it is possible to measure the redshift and the spectrum can be characterized by two key parameters : the total radiated energy , computed by integrating the spectrum in a standard 110000 kev energy band and assuming isotropic emission , , and the peak energy of the cosmological rest - frame spectra of grbs : = @xmath14  @xmath15 . the updated distribution ( as of the end of 2012 ) of for 156 events ( fig .",
    "2 ) is approximately a gaussian centered at a few hundreds of kev and with a low energy extension down to a few kev , corresponding to the so - called x - ray flashes ( xrfs ) or x - ray rich ( xrr ) events .",
    "the distribution of is somewhat similar , extending from @xmath010@xmath16 to more than @xmath010@xmath1 erg , and peaking at @xmath010@xmath17 erg ( fig .  1 ) .    the distribution of as a function of redshift ( fig",
    "3 ) shows the lack of detection of weak events at high redshift ( which is expected as result of an obvious bias due to instruments detection threshold ) while the lack of bright events at low redshifts may be the result of two factors : an intrinsically low rate of events ( less than 3% of sne  ibc are associated with long duration grbs @xcite ) combined with a correlation between the jet opening angle and grb intensity ( the smaller the opening angle is , the brighter the grb appears to be ) . @xcite",
    "in 2002 , based on a small sample of grbs with known redshift and spectral parameters , it was discovered that is significantly correlated with .@xcite this correlation has the form @xmath18 with @xmath19@xmath00.5 and @xmath20@xmath02 , and is characterized by an extra - poissonian scatter normally distributed with a of @xmath00.2 dex around the best fit law .",
    "subsequent observations with various detectors and spectrometers confirmed and extended the correlation ( fig .  4 ) , showing that it holds for all long grbs and xrfs with well measured redshift and spectral parameters.@xcite the data , together with the power law best fitting the long grb points and their confidence regions , have been taken from amati et al .",
    "@xcite    as discussed by several authors , the existence of the relation , its extension over several orders of magnitude in both coordinates , its slope and its intrinsic dispersion are a challenging observational evidence for the current models of the physics and geometry of the prompt emission of grbs.@xcite in addition , the plane can be used to identify different classes of grbs ( short vs.  long ) and get clues on their different nature .",
    "for instance , the consistency of xrfs with the correlation strongly supports the idea that they are not a different class of sources but form the faint tail of the `` cosmological grb '' population .",
    "there is also clear evidence that short grbs , for which redshift estimates became available only in the last few years , do not follow the correlation , indicating that their main emission mechanism , and/or the geometry of their emission , may be different from long ones .",
    "finally , the weak long grb980425 ( only 40 mpc away ) which is also the  prototype \" event for the grb  sn connection , is inconsistent with the correlation , suggesting the possible existence of a  local \" population of sub - energetic grbs with different properties with respect to cosmological long grbs.@xcite",
    "different grb detectors are characterized by different thresholds and spectroscopic sensitivity , therefore they can spread relevant selection effects / biases in the observed correlation . in the past , there were claims that a high fraction ( 7090% ) of batse grbs without redshift would be inconsistent with the correlation for any redshift.@xcite however , this `` peculiar '' conclusion was refuted by other authors @xcite who show that , in fact , most batse grbs with unknown redshift were well consistent with the correlation .",
    "we also note that the inconsistency of such a high percentage of grbs of unknown redshift would have implied that most grbs with known redshift should also be inconsistent with the relation , and this fact was never observed . moreover , amati et al .",
    "( 2009)@xcite showed that the normalization of the correlation varies only marginally using grbs measured by individual instruments with different sensitivities and energy bands , while ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2010 ) @xcite show that the parameters of the correlations ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 ) are independent of redshift .",
    "furthermore , the satellite , thanks to its capability of providing quick and accurate localization of grbs , thus reducing the selection effects in the observational chain leading to the estimate of grb redshift , has further confirmed the reliability of the correlation.@xcite    finally , based on time - resolved analysis of batse , and grbs , it was found that the correlation also holds within each single grb with normalization and slope consistent with those obtained with time - averaged spectra and energetics / luminosity .",
    "@xcite this ultimate test confirms the physical origin of the correlation , also providing clues to its explanation .",
    "the instruments that measure grb fluences cover an energy range from @xmath010 kev to @xmath010 mev .",
    "the spectral energy distribution of grbs peaks typically at hundreds kev , therefore the effect of using the finite spectral band of the detectors on measuring and is negligible .",
    "we have estimated to be affected by this bias by no more than 10%.@xcite this conclusion is also confirmed by the following facts .",
    "* detectors with different energy bands and sensitivity provide the same correlation ( see section 4 and fig .  4 ) .",
    "in addition , cross  calibration of the instruments is taken into account and included in the uncertainties on and . * by dividing the grb sample into subsets with different redshift ranges ( e.g. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , etc . ) , it is found that slope , normalization and dispersion of the correlation do not change significantly along z.@xcite this result also implies that malmquist  like selection effects are negligible .",
    "the idea to use grbs as cosmological rulers was proposed in 2004 , when it was found that the correlation tightened when was replaced with the collimation - corrected radiated energy @xmath23.@xcite this result was based on a small subsample of grbs with known and for which it was possible to infer the jet opening angle @xmath24 from the  break time \"  at which the decay of the light curve of the optical afterglow becomes steeper .",
    "@xcite by exploiting the low scatter of the correlation and applying statistical methods accounting for the lack of calibration , it was possible to derive , within the  standard \" flrw cosmological model , estimates of and consistent with the  concordance \" values mostly coming from the analysis of type ia sne and the cmb .",
    "a review of these methods and results is provided in ghirlanda et al .",
    "( 2006).@xcite the results of these investigations were encouraging , and prompted other studies aimed at deriving a grb hubble diagram , based , e.g. , on the joint use of the correlation together with other weaker correlations between luminosity and observed properties @xcite , or the calibration of the correlation with type ia sne.@xcite    however , in the last years , the simple jet model assumed to compute @xmath24 from the break time of the optical afterglow light curve has been questioned on the basis of different behaviors exhibited by the x - ray afterglow light curves . in many cases achromatic ",
    "jet - breaks \" were not detected.@xcite this fact makes the determination of , and thus the characterization and use of the correlation , less firm and , in any case , model dependent .",
    "( likelihood ) , of the correlation of long grbs as a function of the value of used to compute the values in a flat flrw universe ( from amati et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) . see the text for a description of the maximum - likelihood method adopted . ]",
    "in view of the previous drawbacks , the possibility to measure the cosmological parameters through the correlation was investigated @xcite , which has the advantage , with respect to the correlation , of : i ) allowing for a grb sample about four times larger because it is based on only two observables ( the correlation requires , in addition to and , also @xmath25 ) ii ) unlike of computation , the use of the correlation it is not model dependent . indeed no assumptions about the jet model , afterglow model , density and profile of the circumburst environment , or efficiency of conversion of fireball kinetic energy into radiated energy are needed .",
    "the question is : how to measure if we need to compute the luminosity distance and in turn ?",
    "we can avoid this `` circularity problem '' after floating the value of  between 0 and 1 and assuming that the dispersion of the correlation will minimize corresponding to the choice of the `` correct '' value .",
    "based on a sample of 70 long grbs with known and , it was found that , after assuming a flat universe , the @xmath26 obtained by fitting the correlation with a simple power law is a function of the value of assumed in the computation of .@xcite however , given the significant extra - poissonian scatter of the correlation , the simple @xmath26 method can not be used to obtain reliable confidence levels on both the parameters of the correlation ( normalization and slope ) and the cosmological parameters . in order to get rid of this , amati et al .",
    "( 2008)@xcite adopted a maximum likelihood method @xcite that takes into account the uncertainties in both the @xmath27 and @xmath28 quantities and the extra variance .",
    "remarkably , as can be seen in fig .",
    "5 , the @xmath29(likelihood ) shows a nice parabolic shape , with a minimum at @xmath00.30 .",
    "this a very simple but relevant result : a ) it shows that the correlation can indeed be used to extract clues on the values of cosmological parameters ; b ) it provides evidence , independently of type ia sne , that is significantly smaller than 1 and around 0.3 .    in table  1 , we show the 68% c.l .",

    "( 2008 ) , the 156 grbs available as of the end of 2012 ( amati et al .",
    "2013@xcite ) , a sample of 250 grbs ( 156 real + 94 simulated ) , expected to be available within a few years , and a sample of 500 rbs ( 156 real + 344 simulated ) which may be expected from future dedicated space missions ( see next section ) .",
    "these values were obtained with the same approach as amati et al .",
    "( 2008 ) but using the likelihood function proposed by reichart ( 2001)@xcite , which has the advantage of not requiring the arbitrary choice of an independent variable among and .",
    "interesting enough , we note that , after increasing the number of grbs from 70 to 156 , the accuracy of the estimate of improves by a factor of @xmath30 .",
    "the accuracy of these measurements is still lower than obtained with supernova data , but promising in view of the increasing number of grbs with measured redshift and spectra ( see also fig .  6 , fig .  7 and the next section ) .    [ ta1 ]    in the last 3 lines of table  1 we report the estimates of and derived from the present and expected future samples by assuming that the correlation is calibrated with a 10% accuracy by using , e.g. , the luminosity distances provided by sne  ia , grbs self - calibration or the other methods shortly described below .",
    "the perspectives of this method , combined with the expected increase of the number of grbs in the sample , for the investigation of the properties of  dark energy , \" are shown in fig .",
    "it is important to note that , as the number of grbs in each @xmath31-bin increases , also the feasibility and accuracy of the self - calibration of the correlation will improve .",
    "thus , the expected results shown in the last part of table  1 and in fig .  7 may be obtained even without the need of calibrating grbs against other cosmological probes .",
    "table  1 shows a sharp increase of the accuracy attached to as a consequence of the increasing number of grbs in the plane .",
    "currently , the main contribution to enlarge the grb sample comes from joint detections by , /gbm or konus - wind .",
    "hopefully , these missions will continue to operate in the next years , then providing us with an `` actual '' rate of @xmath01520 grb / year .",
    "however , a real breakthrough in this field should come from next generation ( @xmath322017 ) missions capable of promptly pinpointing the grb localization and of carrying out broad - band spectroscopy .",
    "we build our hopes , e.g. , on the japanese - led calet / gbm experiment for the iss@xcite , the chinese - french mission svom @xcite , the lomonosov / uffo @xcite experiment , an international project led by korea and taiwan , the wfm on - board loft , a mission currently under assessment study within the esa / m3 programme@xcite . in fig .",
    "6 we show the confidence level contours in the  plane by using the real data as of 2012 and by adding to them 113 and 363 simulated grbs ( resulting in two samples of 250 and 500 grbs in total , respectively ) .",
    "the simulated data sets were obtained via monte carlo techniques by taking into account the slope , normalization and dispersion of the observed correlation , the observed redshift distribution of grbs and the distribution of the uncertainties in the measured values of and .",
    "these simulations indicate that with a sample of 250 grbs ( achievable in about 5 years from now ) the accuracy in measuring @xmath3 will be comparable to that currently provided by sne data .",
    "several authors@xcite are investigating the calibration of the correlation at z @xmath33 1.4 by using the luminosity distance versus redshift relation derived from sne  ia .",
    "the goal is to extend the sn ",
    "ia hubble diagram up to redshifts at which the luminosity distance is more sensitive to dark energy properties and evolution .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that , with this method , grbs are no longer an independent cosmological probe .",
    "other approaches include : cosmographic calibration of the correlation@xcite ; self - calibration of the correlation with a large enough number of grbs lying within a narrow ( @xmath34z @xmath0 0.1 - 0.2 ) range of @xmath31 ( promising , but requires a significant sample enlargement ) ; combining the correlation with other ( less tight ) grb correlations @xcite ; extending the correlation by involving other prompt or afterglow properties @xcite aimed at reducing the dispersion of the correlation ( but with the risk of increasing systematics and lowering the number of grbs that can be used ) ; testing alternative cosmologies vs.  the standard @xmath35cdm model@xcite .",
    "particularly promising , are the perspectives of the self - calibration method , which will become feasible and accurate as the number of grbs in the plane will increase.@xcite    understanding the physical basis for the correlation is also of fundamental importance for both grb physics and cosmology , and several groups are working on this issue in the framework of the different scenarios that have been proposed for the origin of grb prompt emission .",
    "due to their huge radiated energies grbs can be observed up to @xmath36 10 , therefore they are very powerful cosmological tools , complementary to other probes such as sn ",
    "ia , clusters , or bao .",
    "the correlation between spectral peak photon energy  and intensity ( , , ) is one of the most robust and intriguing properties of grbs and a promising tool for measuring cosmological parameters .",
    "analyses in the last years provide evidence that , if we live in a flat universe , then is @xmath33 1 at @xmath3299.9% c.l .  and around @xmath00.3 , consistent with current measurements obtained via different methodologies . the simultaneous operation of , /gbm , konus - wind will increase the number of useful samples ( @xmath31 + ) at a rate of 1520 grb / year , improving the accuracy in the estimate of cosmological parameters . future grb experiments ( e.g. , calet / gbm , svom , lomonosov / uffo , loft / wfm ) will increase dramatically the number of grb usable in the plane up to @xmath2 ( 13.2 gyrs in terms of look - back time ) and therefore it will be possible to use them to follow the dependence on time ( if any ) of the density of vacuum energy since the early stages of the universe .    in conclusion , grbs have already provided a direct and independent measurement of and simulations show that on a time scale of @xmath05 years they will be able to achieve a comparable accuracy to sne  ia .",
    "but the surplus value of grbs is that , in perspective , they can measure @xmath6 and @xmath8 , namely the evolution of dark energy with time .",
