    "the two  dimensional electron gas that can be realized in quantum wells or at the interface of semiconducting heterostructures has attracted a lot of interest over the years@xcite .",
    "such interest has been recently renewed by the the discovery of an apparent metallic phase which is at variance with the predictions of the scaling theory of localization for non - interacting 2d systems at zero magnetic field@xcite . the strictly two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) embedded in a uniform neutralizing background",
    "has been often used to describe the physics of these devices@xcite . however it has been recently found that the 2deg model is too simple to provide a quantitative account of experiments , which can only be achieved through the inclusion in the model of essential device details , such as the finite transverse thickness@xcite , the in  plane anisotropic mass@xcite , the valley degeneracy present for instance in @xmath0-based devices@xcite , the scattering sources ( disorder ) which determine the mobility@xcite .    here",
    ", we discuss the effect of disorder on the ground state energy and spin susceptibility of narrow @xmath1 quantum wells ( qw)@xcite and a gaas higfet@xcite , analyzing as well the role of different scattering sources .",
    "we stress that an accurate treatment of electron correlation is crucial in the present approach , which is based on the properties of the ideally ",
    "clean interacting electron gas ; in particular on its ground state energy and static response functions , the latter being a key ingredient in the evaluation of the ground state energy shift due to disorder .",
    "moreover , some of the parameters modelling the disorder are not known from experiments and we choose to fix them by fitting the experimental mobility within the born approximation .",
    "the set of parameters determined in such a way is then used to estimate the effect of disorder on the ground state energy , within second order perturbation theory .    in the first section",
    "we introduce the model and give some details on our estimate of the ( wavevector and spin - polarization dependent ) density  density response function .",
    "we then present our results for the mobility , obtained using the born approximation , in the second section .",
    "finally , we discuss the effect of disorder on the spin susceptibility enhancement and ground state energy in the third section and offer some conclusions .",
    "our starting point is the strictly 2d1v electron gas ( 2d1veg ) , whose state at zero temperature and magnetic field can be fixed by just two dimensionless parameters : the coupling @xmath2 and the spin polarization @xmath3 . above ,",
    "@xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the spin up and spin down areal densities , @xmath6 , and specific parameters of the solid state device appear only in the effective bohr radius @xmath7 , via the dielectric constant @xmath8 and the band mass @xmath9 .    in this work",
    "we assume that the ground state of the 2d1veg in the presence of disorder provides a first reasonable approximations to the observed metallic phase ; we assume as well that , with respect to the ideally clean system , the ground state is not strongly altered by a weak disorder ",
    "at least far from the metal - insulator transition  and therefore the effect of scattering sources can be accounted for by perturbation theory .",
    "we note in passing that a realistic description of these systems must necessarily take into account disorder , in order to predict a finite ( or vanishing ) mobility .",
    "the energy per particle of the 2d1veg in the presence of a weak uncorrelated disorder reads , at the lowest ( second ) order in perturbation theory , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the fourier transform ( ft ) of the random scattering potential and @xmath12 denotes the average on the disorder configuration distribution .",
    "above , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are respectively the energy and the density - density linear response of the ideally clean system .",
    "@xmath13 can be readily calculated from the analytical parametrization of quantum monte carlo energies given in ref .",
    "we describe how to construct @xmath14 , which is accurately known only at @xmath15@xcite , in the subsection 2.1 below .    for the extremely clean higfet the random scattering comes from the unintentional doping of the @xmath16 channel by charged impurities with density @xmath17 and/or from the charged scatterers in the @xmath18 barrier .",
    "the @xmath19 for these scatterers are taken from @xcite .",
    "the unknown densities of charged scatterers ( @xmath17 and @xmath20 ) are obtained from a fitting of the mobility as described in sec . 2 below . here",
    ", we just mention that the depletion density @xmath17 is expected to be negligible in these systems and indeed our best mobility fit is compatible with @xmath21 .",
    "many scattering sources contribute to the finite mobility of the qw@xcite : remote impurities due to the intentional _ delta _ doping , three dimensional homogenous background doping with density @xmath22 in the algaas , possible unintentional doping in the alas channel with density @xmath23 and above all fluctuations of the quantum well width , which is usually modeled with a contribution to @xmath24 @xmath25@xcite .",
    "the first source can be modeled as the scattering coming from a sheet of randomly distributed charged impurities of areal density @xmath26 separated from the side of the qw by an algaas spacer of width @xmath27 ( in this case @xmath28 and @xmath29@xcite ) .",
    "the unknown parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are fixed through the mobility fit . for completeness",
    ", we need to add that here we considered background doping only in the spacer between the qw and the delta doping sheet .",
    "the density - density linear response function for a partially spin polarized system can be written in terms of local ",
    "field factors ( lff ) depending on the wavevector @xmath32 , as well as on charge and magnetization densities , respectively @xmath33 and @xmath34@xcite : @xmath35,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) is the spin resolved density  density response function for the non - interacting system@xcite , @xmath38 is the fourier transform of the coulomb interaction , and @xmath39 are the lff .",
    "a complete description of the response functions relies on the knowledge of the lff in the whole momentum region .",
    "we note here that the exact low  momentum behaviour ( @xmath40 ) of the lff is known in terms of the exchange - correlation energy @xmath41@xcite : @xmath42 with @xmath43",
    ". the simplest approximation would be to extend the low - momenta linear behaviour ( @xmath44 ) of the lff to all momenta .",
    "we have tested the effect on the response of the linear approximation ( la ) for @xmath45 and @xmath46 , at zero polarisation , with available qmc data@xcite .",
    "deviations from the la become more evident as the system becomes more strongly interacting .",
    "we report in results for @xmath47 and @xmath48 at @xmath49 and @xmath50 where the deviation of the la from the qmc data is more evident .",
    "note that for @xmath51 , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) only involves @xmath45",
    "( @xmath46 ) . for the charge case ( left panel in ) the la for @xmath45 works quite well at least up to @xmath52 . for the spin case ( right panel in ) the @xmath48 obtained from the la for @xmath46 shows important deviations from the qmc results over the whole range @xmath53 , while a much better and in fact",
    "satisfactory agreement is obtained with the exponential approximation , whereby @xmath54}$ ] and @xmath55 .",
    "an analytical parametrizations of the lff@xcite embodying the exact known behaviour at small and large momenta is available for @xmath50 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , while it could be used for the calculation of mobility ( see below ) it is of no use for the calculation of the spin susceptibility , which requires the @xmath57dependence of the lff .",
    "in computing the @xmath57dependent correction to the ground state energy , we have used the la for @xmath45 and @xmath58 and the ea for @xmath46 .",
    "we do not discuss in detail here the behavior of @xmath58 , which appears to be one order of magnitude smaller that the other two lff and therefore should not affect results in an appreciable manner .",
    "quite generally , not all parameters entering the modelling of the scattering sources are know from experiments and we take the customary approach in which the unkwon once are fixed through a global fit of the experimental mobility .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath59 at the lowest order in the scattering potential is given by the born approximation@xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "the integrand in is peaked around @xmath52 because of the combined effect of the factors @xmath62 and @xmath63 , the latter being strongly enhanced by @xmath64 with respect to its rpa expression .",
    "an accurate estimate of @xmath64 in this region of momenta is therefore crucial : the disorder parameters can increase by almost an order of magnitude if one replace @xmath65 with @xmath66 in the mobility fit .",
    "here we use @xmath45 for a strictly two dimensional system and accordingly we set @xmath67 .",
    "this may look at first a very crude assumption for the higfet@xcite , which is characterized by a sizeable thickness .",
    "however we have checked , within rpa , that while the fitted disorder parameters change appreciably in going from the @xmath68 to @xmath69 , the energy shift due to disorder does not change sensibly provided the same consistent combination of @xmath70 and disorder parameters used for the mobility is also used for the energy shift calculation .",
    "the same applies to the ensuing spin susceptibility .",
    "mobility results for the two devices considered are shown in . in the qw",
    "the surface roughness plays the major role in determing the mobility at high densities ( @xmath71 , @xmath72 ) in agreement with existing literature@xcite ( see left panel of ) . at low density , however , roughly below @xmath73 , the born approximation is not able to reproduce the experimental data anymore .",
    "this is a density region where the charged impurities ( @xmath74 ) become effective . in the right panel of we display results for the highfet with @xmath21 and @xmath75 .",
    "the discrepancy of these disorder parameters with those in @xcite is due to the replacement , with respect to the previous calculation , of @xmath76 with @xmath77 .",
    "the effect of such a change on the spin susceptibility is however barely visible , as it can be checked by comparing the results in with those in @xcite .",
    "we should mention that both in the present calculations and those of @xcite we have chosen the form of @xmath19 appropriate to a thick electron gas .",
    "the spin susceptibility enhancement of the systems under investigation is@xcite @xmath78_{\\zeta=0 } \\biggl [ \\frac{\\partial^2 e^{qmc } ( r_s,\\zeta)}{\\partial \\zeta^2 } + \\frac{\\partial^2\\delta e ( r_s,\\zeta)}{\\partial \\zeta^2 } \\biggr]_{\\zeta=0}^{-1 } , \\label{chi_spin}\\ ] ] where @xmath79 is the energy of the non - interacting system , @xmath80 the energy shift due to disorder defined in , and @xmath81 the energy of the clean system , which may include , if necessary , the effect of thickness . as mentioned above , the results of this calculation strongly depend on the lff in the region around @xmath82 , region where @xmath14 has a sizeable change when varying @xmath57 around zero .",
    "we stress that the parameters describing the disorder are fixed by a fit of the experimental mobility and depend on @xmath45 at zero polarisation ; while @xmath83 requires the knowledge of all lff and their @xmath57dependence .    before examining in detail our results for the spin susceptibility , summarized in",
    ", we make some general comments on the effect of disorder .",
    "apart from the surface roughness at very high density ( @xmath84 ) , where it induces a negligible reduction of spin susceptibility , the effect of all scattering sources is to enhance @xmath85 , once electron correlation is included in the response function , even at rpa level .",
    "a calculation employing the response function @xmath86 of non - interacting electrons and including only the roughness scattering , for example , predicts a suppression of the spin susceptibility at all densities . on lowering the electron density",
    "the relative contribution of disorder to the second derivative of the energy , with respect to @xmath57 , increases in size and being negative leads to the eventual divergence of the spin susceptibility .",
    "we note that quite generally the transverse thickness reduces the spin susceptibility of a 2d electron systems , while disorder generally enhances it@xcite .",
    "as it is clearly seen in , in the extremely clean case of the highfet , the inclusion of disorder does not alter the agreement between the theoretical prediction ( obtained including thickness ) and measurements , throughout the whole experimental density range@xcite .",
    "if one neglects thickness and uses the disorder parameters fitted to the experimental mobility of the highfet , as specified above , the energy shift due to disorder makes the ferromagnetic state of the strictly 2deg energetically favourable with respect to the normal state at @xmath87 .",
    "in contrast , the same procedure using the disorder parameters appropriate to the thin electron gas realized in alas qws@xcite predicts a transition towards a partially polarised state at @xmath88 , namely a second - order phase transition .",
    "we should stress , however , that for this system the fitting of the experimental mobility in the born approximation breaks down at low densities ( corresponding to @xmath89 ) , as clearly shown in . yet , up to @xmath90 , our prediction for the spin susceptibility is only moderately affected by disorder ( thick solid line ( a ) in ) , with an enhancement with respect to the clean system of at most 20% , which results in a very good agreement with experiments . by looking at the theoretical prediction for the spin susceptibility enhancement obtained including only the scattering by charged impurities ( dotted line ( c ) ) or only that by roughness ( thin solid line ( b ) ) , it is evident the major role played by roughness at all densities , as well as the negligible effect of charged scatterers at high density ( due to screening ) . at low densities , though being quite smaller than that of roughness , the effect of charged impurities on @xmath91 becomes however sizeable . within second order perturbation theory , lowering the density , disorder becomes more and more effective enhancing the spin susceptibility and finally driving it to diverge .",
    "a strong enhancement is found also in the experiments , however we can not push our quantitative comparison between the experiments and our predictions in density regions where the level of disorder can not be reliably related to the experimental mobility using the born approximation .",
    "we stress that the accuracy of the prediction of the spin susceptibility of the clean 2d1v electron gas is crucial in the present approach , as suggested by the comparison between theory and experiment for the thin electron gas realized in narrow @xmath1 qws@xcite , for which the effect of thickness is negligible@xcite . in this respect ,",
    "we recall that rpa predicts for the 2d1v electron gas a first order ferromagnetic transition already at @xmath92 and a @xmath85 divergence in the paramagnetic phase at @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "evidently the inclusion of disorder in rpa would push the bloch and stoner transitions@xcite at higher density , well inside the experimental range .",
    "we have studied the effect of disorder on the spin susceptibility of 2d electron systems realized in semiconductor heterostructures , considering narrow @xmath1-based qws and a @xmath16-based highfet , systems which have an in - plane isotropic mass and no valley degeneracy .",
    "we take as reference , in assessing the effect of disorder , the ideally clean 2d1v electron gas , whose spin susceptibility is known with great accuracy , thanks to qmc simulations@xcite .",
    "we found that the effect of a weak uncorrelated disorder is to enhance the spin susceptibility , at the lowest order in perturbation theory , with correlation seemingly playing a crucial role .",
    "the disorder parameters which were not known from experiments were determined through a fit of the experimental mobility over the whole experimental density range , in the born approximation , and then used without any change in the spin susceptibility calculation .",
    "we discovered that , at densities where the born approximation is capable of fitting the experimental mobility , also our prediction of the spin susceptibility in the _ dirty _ system turns out to be very accurate ; while it appreciably deviates from the experiment at densities where the born approximation breaks down , or more precisely , is unable to fit the experimental mobility .    thus , the really weak disorder present in the @xmath16 higfet of @xcite has a small effect on the spin susceptibility and does not change qualitatively the phase diagram of the 2d1v electron gas .",
    "evidently , the disorder in the @xmath1 qws of @xcite is much stronger and it can be possibly treated in perturbation theory only at densities not too low .",
    "it is anyhow reassuring that when the perturbative approach is capable of quantitatively fitting the experimental mobility also the resulting prediction of the spin susceptibility enhancement is in good agreement with experiments .",
