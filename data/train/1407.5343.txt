    "<S> in this paper we investigate how the complexity of chaotic phase spaces affect the efficiency of importance sampling monte carlo simulations . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on a flat - histogram simulation of the distribution of finite - time lyapunov exponent in a simple chaotic system and obtain analytically that the computational effort of the simulation : ( i ) scales polynomially with the finite - time , a tremendous improvement over the exponential scaling obtained in usual uniform sampling simulations ; and ( ii ) the polynomial scalling is sub - optimal , a phenomenon known as critical slowing down . </S>",
    "<S> we show that critical slowing down appears because of the limited possibilities to issue a local proposal on the monte carlo procedure in chaotic systems . </S>",
    "<S> these results remain valid in other methods and show how generic properties of chaotic systems limit the efficiency of monte carlo simulations . </S>"
