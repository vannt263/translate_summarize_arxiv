    "this line , often seen in agn , is interpreted as fe fluorescence from cold ( neutral ) matter far from the inner accretion disk @xcite . a viable explanation for its absence in mrk  876 can come from the x  ray baldwin effect @xcite , an anti - correlation between the equivalent width of the fe k line and x  ray luminosity , which can be explained by the drop of the covering factor of the molecular agn torus @xcite .",

    "the inclination angle of mrk  876 s accretion disk of @xmath30 deg is independently constrained by @xcite .",

    "we constrain the emission - region on the accretion disk by simulating the model of @xcite accounting for its different emissivity power - law indices and taking care of the uncertainties of the inclination angle of the source .",
    "the gravitational redshift factor of @xmath33 can not be obtained from emission - regions at radii above @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 ) reaching at most a factor of 0.89 . on the contrary for radii below @xmath34",
    "such a gravitational redshift factor can be well reproduced .",
    "only accretion disks of kerr black holes can extend below @xmath34 @xcite emphasizing once again the environment of a rotating black hole .",
    "on the other hand , for schwarzschild black holes , a detailed line profile study by @xcite allows for the fluorescence fe k@xmath2 line emission from material spiraling toward the event horizon even below 6 @xmath36 .",
    "however , the profile is predicted to be double  peaked for accretion disk inclination angles other than face  on , in contrast to our finding . as a result",
    ", the line can be reproduced by a rotating black hole only .",
    "this is in agreement with a range of spectral parameters predicted in an accurate study by @xcite for a black hole with angular momentum @xmath37=0.9 and disk inclination @xmath38=30 deg for a hotspot on an accretion disk emitting photons from its last stable orbit @xmath39 .",
    "unfortunately the low signal - to - noise spectrum does not allow for a more constraining fit with the laor  model or with the more complex ` kerrdisk`-model .",
    "the same low signal - to - noise ratio prevents from attempting a cross - correlation study between the line light curve and the continuum light curve ( both shown in figure  [ fig : lc ] ) that are predicted to correlate in the hotspot framework @xcite . also correlation studies between _ swift_/xrt and",
    "_ swift_/bat are impossible due to the low signal - to - noise observations of the latter @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no uvot data were taken , which could constrain the geometry of the emitting region @xcite .",
    "on the other hand the independent estimates of the black hole mass of mrk  876 @xcite allow us to compute the orbital period for the hotspot on the accretion disk .",
    "@xcite predict the line to appear for a relatively short fraction of the total orbital period of the hotspot at the distance from the black hole where the line occurs .",

    "this is in agreement with the narrow lines to appear for a fraction of the total period as the flare dies out or emission gets below detectability @xcite .",
    "the _ swift / xrt _ observation ( obs i d : 00050302001 ) taken 6 days later without any line detection , makes the hotspot scenario a consistent picture .",
    "also the line feature has never been observed in any other x  ray observation confirming the transient nature of the event that reinforces the hotspot origin .",
    "+   + another hypothetical origin of the line could be the emission from enhanced abundances of sub  fe elements resulting from fe spallation .",
    "in this scenario , fe nuclei hit by cosmic  rays are converted into elements of atomic number @xmath46 below fe .",
    "the element emitting closest to our line energy would be vanadium at 4.9 kev ( rest  frame energy ) .",
    "however , the absence of the fe k@xmath2 at 6.4 kev , which would still be the strongest line in this scenario @xcite , makes it an unlikely explanation .",
    "also the transient nature of the line would be difficult to explain . + in a further hypothesis a @xmath14.7 kev ( rest  frame energy ) spectral feature could originate also from compton down - scattered fe line from fexxv at 6.7 kev @xcite .",
    "however , the resulting gaussian component is expected to be much broader ( @xmath1 0.4 kev ) . also , this component needed to be present in all our analyzed mrk  876 spectra .",
    "thus , the down - scattered fe line is also very unlikely . + a redshifted fe",
    "line could originate also from inflows and outflows of material ( not related to the accretion disk ) in the vicinity of the black hole . in this region",
    "the material would be subject to strong gravitational effects reaching mildly relativistic ( @xmath10.4c ) velocities @xcite causing an energy shift of emission lines .",
    "this is the interpretation for a line shift observed in mrk  766 in a detailed and time - resolved study by @xcite in presence of a strong fe k@xmath2 component at 6.4 kev .",
    "in fact , the absence of this latter component in all our analyzed observations of mrk  876 disfavors this interpretation since it is difficult to imagine one single blob of material emitting an fe line .",
    "in addition our observations a month earlier ( obs i d : 00050300005 ) and 6 days later ( obs i d : 00050302001 ) with _",
    "swift_/xrt should have detected the corresponding 6.4 kev line .",
    "a detailed study by @xcite suggests that reported line significances might be altered by a publication bias where only most significant among detected spectral features are mentioned .",
    "such an important issue can be addressed by a statistical study of a sample as a whole where several lower significance lines are detected as e.g. in @xcite .",
    "instead , our study reports a case study of a transient event in the hotspot scenario .",
    "therefore , to determine the detection likelihood we can not incorporate the non - presence of the lines in other observations .",
    "also is it here impossible to address the publication bias as it must address the bias for a source population at large @xcite .",
    "our analysis of the _ swift_/xrt observation of mrk  876 ( obs i d : 00050300004 ) has revealed an emission line at @xmath0 kev rest  frame energy associated to the source .",
    "the line is detected at @xmath199% confidence level through monte carlo simulations using @xmath28 and @xmath23-statistic .",
    "the possible origin of the line is the hotspot scenario in which a flare in the hot corona ( possibly due to magnetic reconnection ) illuminates a limited portion of the accretion disk that emits the fe line by fluorescence . due to the independent constraints of the low inclination of mrk  876 s accretion disk ( 15.4 deg ) and the observed gravitational redshift",
    ", we can constrain that the line is emitted from the accretion disk at radii below 6 @xmath36 ( where @xmath47 ) from a kerr black hole . the alternative possible origins due to fe spallation ,",
    "down - scattered fe line , and mass inflows / outflows are disfavored in light of the absence of the 6.4 kev fe line and the variability studies due to the many available observations of _ swift_/xrt , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ ginga_.",
