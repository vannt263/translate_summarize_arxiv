    "the idea of the existence of extra spatial dimensions has fascinated physicists for nearly a century  @xcite .",
    "a quantum theory of gravity seems to be consistent only via extension to extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "if compactification of the extra dimensions occurs near the grand unification scale or the planck scale @xmath3 , then the effects of quantum gravity would be accessible only at very high energy scales , beyond the reach of any collider experiment . in this case",
    ", one would have to understand the mechanism of weak scale stabilization ( at about 100 gev ) against radiative corrections , the so - called hierarchy problem .",
    "recently , a radical scenario has been advocated  @xcite wherein quantum gravity may become significant at a much lower energy scale ( @xmath4 ) , as low as @xmath5 . the apparent large planck scale ( @xmath6 ) is then attributed to the more rapid @xmath7 decrease of the gravitational force with distance in @xmath8 extra space dimensions . in terms of the large compactification size , @xmath9 , of the extra dimensions this leads to and @xmath4 .",
    "it is taken to be @xmath10 in @xcite ; and to be @xmath11 in @xcite where @xmath12 is the newton s constant .",
    "for the convenience of calculations for physical quantities , we take the normalization to be @xcite @xmath13 . ]",
    "m_pl^2~r^n m_s^n+2 .",
    "such a scenario alleviates the hierarchy problem by restating it as a geometrical one , namely understanding the size of the compact dimensions and the scale @xmath4 at which compactification occurs .",
    "this scenario could be realized in certain string formulations  @xcite . naturally , after compactification",
    ", there will be towers of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations with mass separation of @xmath14 . to avoid conflicts with the standard model ( sm )",
    ", it is assumed that the sm fields are stuck to a 4-dimensional hyper - surface , while only gravitons propagate in the extra dimensions .",
    "if we are interested in low - scale quantum gravity effects with @xmath15 , the minimal scenario @xmath16 has been ruled out because @xmath17  km , which would yield effects visible in planetary motion . for @xmath18 , although there is no conflict with newtonian gravity or astronomy for @xmath190.1 mm , the constraint from supernova cooling has put a bound on the scale up to @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "one may even be able to push the scale up to @xmath21 from the spectrum for diffuse gamma radiation  @xcite . for @xmath22 , there is no experimental or observational conflict with the theory .",
    "most interestingly , there will be significant consequences for low - energy phenomenology with this scenario .",
    "although the coupling for an individual kk excitation is gravitationally suppressed , the cumulative effect from the tower of states is suppressed only by @xmath23 .",
    "generically , there are two classes of collider signals induced by the kk gravitons .",
    "first , real kk gravitons can be emitted off sm fields .",
    "second , virtual kk gravitons may be exchanged between external sm fields .",
    "there have been many studies proposing searches for visible signatures of extra dimensions at colliders  @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we study another process to explore the sensitivity to probe low - scale quantum gravity effects , drell - yan charged lepton pair production , which has previously been used as a powerful test of the standard model and has provided severe constraints on new physics . for the process of current interest , we look for the clean signal pp ^+ ^- +   x , [ dymiss ] where the missing transverse energy @xmath24 is due to an escaping kk graviton .",
    "we calculate the signal rate and those of the leading sm backgrounds , and study the sensitivity to probe quantum gravity effects both at the tevatron and at the lhc .",
    "the signal subprocess is q |q ^+ ^- + g_kk where @xmath25 , and the graviton @xmath26 escapes the detector , resulting in missing energy .",
    "the signal can be described by fourteen tree level feynman diagrams , seven each for @xmath27 and @xmath28 exchange , where a graviton is attached to each sm field and also to each sm vertex .",
    "thus , off - shell effects of the @xmath27 boson are fully included .",
    "this would be extremely tedious to calculate by hand , or even with the aid of a trace - based feynman graph program , but we can make this straightforward by using the helicity amplitude method : summing the numerical values of individual feynman graph amplitudes for a set of fixed external helicities and momenta , then squaring the summed amplitude and integrating over all possible helicities and phase space numerically .    to do this , we constructed three new helas  @xcite vertex routines , for the graviton - fermion - fermion , graviton - gauge boson - gauge boson and graviton - fermion - fermion - gauge boson vertices  @xcite .",
    "coding of the matrix elements can then easily be done by hand .",
    "we have verified current conservation for the full matrix elements both analytically and numerically . the summation over kk states with different mass",
    "is carried out numerically based on the weight function in  @xcite .    as we are including photon interference effects",
    ", we must allow the @xmath27 to be off - shell , and thus must include finite - width effects for the @xmath27 propagators .",
    "this presents a problem for the calculation , as the graviton amplitudes are not gauge invariant for a @xmath27 propagator including an imaginary piece .",
    "while we believe we can provide a formal prescription for properly including such a term , for the moment we must rely on an approximation that is known to be extremely reliable  @xcite : we do not include a finite width in the matrix elements , but instead multiply the summed - squared amplitude by an overall factor where @xmath29 is the parton c.m .",
    "energy squared and @xmath30 the invariant mass of the lepton pair .",
    "this factor removes the zero - width propagators from the matrix elements and inserts breit - wigner resonances for the @xmath27 boson . for phase space regions where the principal contribution comes from graphs where the incoming quark pair or outgoing lepton pair have invariant masses far from the @xmath27 mass ,",
    "this factor is essentially unity .",
    "when either pair is at or near the @xmath27 mass , it approximates the full cross section by the correct resonant contributions .",
    "for the numerical evaluations , we use cteq4l parton distribution functions  @xcite and the ew parameters @xmath31  gev , @xmath32  gev , @xmath33 , and @xmath34  gev@xmath35 .",
    "we choose the factorization scale @xmath36 of the lepton system .",
    "we impose basic acceptance cuts for event identification , based on detector capability .",
    "these are [ eq : base1tev ] & & p_t()>15  , |_| < 2.0 , + [ eq : base1lhc ] & & p_t()>20  , |_| < 2.5 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the transverse momentum and the pseudo - rapidity of a charged lepton .",
    "a defining feature of the signal is the missing transverse momentum due to the escaping massive graviton .",
    "also , most signal events are produced in association with a @xmath27 boson .",
    "the irreducible sm background to this signal is from @xmath39 events , which are dominated by @xmath40 and @xmath41 production , which we call `` drell - yan@xmath42 '' .",
    "we want to reduce the photon continuum from @xmath41 events where the virtual photon produces a relatively low mass lepton pair , and therefore require [ eq : base2 ] /e_t",
    "> 20  , m _",
    "> 10   . for the tevatron at @xmath43  tev ( run i ) with these cuts ,",
    "this sm background is 9.4  fb ; at @xmath44  tev ( run ii ) it rises to 11  fb .",
    "the slightly higher @xmath45 and greatly increased luminosity expected for run ii allow us to impose an additional cut on the missing transverse energy , [ eq : tev2 ] /e_t > 100   , reducing the sm background to only 1.25  fb .",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 )    [ fig : ang_dist ]    the much higher @xmath45 available at the lhc allows for the emission of much heavier gravitons and for a significant recoil of the dilepton system .",
    "this is reflected in the normalized dilepton angular distribution of figure  [ fig : ang_dist ] , for an @xmath2 signal and the dy@xmath42 background : ( a ) azimuthal opening angle @xmath46 ; and ( b ) separation @xmath47 .",
    "these plots show distinct differences for the signal and background .",
    "the final state leptons of the signal are preferentially emitted in the same direction , close to each other , while in the background the leptons tend to be more back - to - back .",
    "we can thus impose further cuts on the leptons , requiring [ eq : ang ] _",
    "< 90^ , < 1.2 . this heavy graviton emission will also result in the signal exhibiting a much harder @xmath48 spectrum , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : pt_miss ] .",
    "we therefore suggest an even higher @xmath48 cut for the lhc , [ eq : lhc ] /e_t > 150   .",
    "after the cuts of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : base1lhc],[eq : base2],[eq : ang],[eq : lhc ] ) , the sm background at the lhc is 2.8  fb .",
    "a feature of any effective theory is that it is a low - energy approximation and can not be trusted at large energies , comparable to the defining scale of the theory . applying this rule to the present case",
    ", our calculation requires some additional care for @xmath49 , as a non - trivial fraction of those signal events occur at center of mass energies @xmath50 .",
    "a conservative estimate of the signal is obtained by discarding any events with @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "more generally one could invoke form - factor damping of the high energy region . to obtain estimates of the string scales which can be probed",
    "experimentally we employ an iterative procedure , starting with a seed value for @xmath4 and throwing away all events with @xmath50 .",
    "the resulting signal cross section is used to recompute a new exclusion limit for @xmath4 , assuming a simple scaling behavior of the signal cross section , @xmath51 . using the new exclusion limit as the upper bound on the allowable @xmath45 range , one obtains a stable exclusion limit in only 2 - 3 iterations .",
    "however , for @xmath52 most of the signal events populate this unphysical region , and the overlap of the validity range of the effective theory with the range which would provide for a visible signal shrinks to zero . in this situation ,",
    "one is unable to obtain any reliable estimate for a probe to @xmath4 via @xmath48 signals .",
    "instead , one would expect to first observe string excitations of particles states as a signature for new physics  @xcite .",
    "( 0,0)(0,0 )    in table  [ table1 ] , we summarize the sensitivity reach to the scale @xmath4 for @xmath53 via the process of eq .",
    "( [ dymiss ] ) at the tevatron and the lhc .",
    "we see that this mode is a quite promising search channel .",
    "although the tevatron can impose some bounds , it is much more impressive to search for the signal at the lhc , its reach being several tev for @xmath54 extra dimensions .",
    ".string scale @xmath4 @xmath55 cl exclusion limits ( tev ) at the tevatron and lhc for @xmath56 extra dimensions . for the tevatron run i value",

    "( [ eq : base1tev],[eq : base2 ] ) , and the additional cut of eq .",

    "( [ eq : base1lhc],[eq : ang],[eq : lhc ] ) .",
    "the limits take into account the @xmath57 requirement discussed in the text . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a comparison with other studies at hadron colliders is in order .",
    "while the monojet@xmath58 signal  @xcite from processes like @xmath59 has the largest rate , it also has much more severe qcd backgrounds , mostly due to the mismeasurement of jets in the forward regions of the detector .",
    "@xcite obtained results comparable to ours . for instance , at the lhc a @xmath55  cl limit is expected for @xmath60 with @xmath61 . on the other hand , ref .",
    "@xcite reached a more impressive conclusion , claiming a 5@xmath62 discovery for @xmath63 ( 6.0 )  tev with @xmath64 ( 4 ) extra dimensions to our normalization convention . ] .",
    "alternatively , the virtual @xmath26 contribution to the dy process of @xmath65 can be also significant .",
    "it was found that a @xmath55  cl limit can be reached a scale @xmath66 at the tevatron and the lhc  @xcite , with a little dependence on @xmath8 .",
    "however , one would have to introduce an additional assumption for a cutoff scale @xmath67above which the virtual kk tower is truncated , making a direct comparison of @xmath4 exclusion limits from external @xmath26 production versus virtual exchange difficult .",
    "we have explored the search sensitivity for signals of large extra dimensions at hadron colliders via the drell - yan process @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) where the missing transverse energy is the result of escaping kaluza - klein gravitons .",
    "this is a very clean channel for hadron collider physics .",
    "we find that one is able to place exclusion limits on the gravity scale up to 560 gev at the fermilab tevatron , and up to 4.0 ( 3.3 ) tev at the cern lhc , for @xmath2 ( 4 ) extra dimensions .",
    "this reach is comparable to one found in previous studies of the monojet@xmath58 process  @xcite and for virtual contributions of @xmath26 to the dy process  @xcite .",
