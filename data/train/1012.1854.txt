    "the carbon - rich agb ( asymptotic giant branch ) star irc+10216 ( cw leonis ) is surrounded by a dense , outflowing envelope that harbors a rich chemistry .",
    "because of its proximity to earth ( @xmath6  pc ) and its large mass - loss rate ( @xmath7 ; see crosas & menten 1997 and schier & olofsson 2000 ) , irc+10216 has proven to be the most valuable source available for the study of chemistry in a carbon - rich astrophysical environment ; more than 60 molecules ( e.g. he et al .",
    "2008 ) have been detected within its circumstellar envelope ( cse ) , made up of the elements h , c , n , o , f , na , mg , al , si , s , p , f , and k. the photosphere of irc+10216 has been significantly enriched in carbon  owing to the dredge - up of helium - burning nuclear reaction products from the core  leading to a large c / o ratio ( @xmath8 ; winters , dominik , & sedlmayr 1994 ) and giving rise to a circumstellar chemistry that is qualitatively different from that typical of oxygen - rich agb stars . in particular , while the most abundant molecules in o - rich cses are co and h@xmath9o , those in irc+10216 are co , hcn , and @xmath10 . prior to 2001 ,",
    "the only oxygen - rich molecules reported in the cse of irc+10216 were co , sio , and hco@xmath11 ( lucas & gulin 1999 ) , but in the last decade four other o - bearing molecules have been detected : h@xmath9o ( melnick et al .",
    "2001 ) , oh ( ford et al .",
    "2003 ) , @xmath12 ( ford et al .",
    "2004 ) , and @xmath13 ( tenenbaum et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the discovery of water vapor in irc+10216 , obtained by observations of the @xmath14 rotational transition near 557 ghz with the use of the _ submillimeter wave astronomy satellite _ ( swas ) , was puzzling because models for thermochemical equilibrium in the photospheres of carbon - rich stars predict water abundances of only @xmath15 relative to h@xmath9 ( e.g.  cherchneff 2006 ) , many orders of magnitude below the detection threshold or the abundance @xmath16 inferred ( agndez and cernicharo 2006 ; gonzlez - alfonso , neufeld and melnick 2007 ) from swas observations .",
    "several hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of the observed water vapor .",
    "ford & neufeld ( 2001 ) proposed a model whereby the water vapor was released into the outflow by the vaporization of a kuiper belt analog , in which orbiting icy objects  heated by the enhanced luminosity of the agb star ",
    "underwent sublimation .",
    "willacy ( 2004 ) subsequently suggested that the observed water could be formed from co and h@xmath9 by means of fischer - tropsch catalysis on metallic dust grains , whilst agndez and cernicharo ( 2006 ; hereafter ac06 ) proposed that water might be formed in the outer envelope by means of radiative association of h@xmath9 with o atoms produced by the photodissociation of @xmath17 exposed to the ultraviolet interstellar radiation field ( isrf ) .",
    "because swas had access to only a single transition of water vapor , it was unable to place observational constraints that could readily distinguish between these hypotheses .",
    "in a theoretical study ( gonzlez - alfonso , neufeld and melnick 2007 ; hereafter gnm ) performed in anticipation of the _ herschel space observatory _ , it was discussed how each of these hypotheses gave rise to a specific prediction for the spatial distribution of the emitting water vapor .",
    "gnm investigated how multitransition observations with _ herschel _ might be used to determine that distribution , and showed , in particular , that the relative strength of lines of higher excitation than those accessible to swas was a decreasing function of the inner radius , @xmath18 , of the region containing water vapor .",
    "the vaporization of a kuiper belt analog would lead to @xmath19 ( model b in gnm ; where @xmath20 is the assumed stellar radius ) because any icy object ( at least of small size and on a circular orbit ) within that radius would have been vaporized before irc+10216 ascended the agb .",
    "water production by means of fischer - tropsch catalysis would result in a similar value of @xmath18 , according to calculations of willacy ( 2004 ) .",
    "the formation of water following the photodissociation of co in an outer shell , as suggested by ac06 , by contrast , would lead to a much larger @xmath21 ( model c in gnm ) , and considerably smaller strengths for the higher - excitation water transitions .",
    "conversely , were @xmath18 significantly smaller than @xmath22  a possibility that had not been anticipated by any _ specific _ model  then the high - excitation transitions would be relatively stronger ( model a in gnm ) .    in this _",
    "letter _ , we report the results obtained from _ herschel _ ( pilbratt et al .",
    "2010 ) observations of 10 rotational transitions of water vapor , carried with the heterodyne instrument for the far infrared ( hifi ; de graauw et al .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in  2 , and the spectral line profiles and line intensities are presented in  3 . in  4 , we discuss the spatial distribution inferred for the water vapor in the cse of irc+10216 , in the context of various hypotheses for its origin .",
    "we compare our results with those reported recently in an entirely independent study performed by decin et al .",

    "observations of irc+10216 were carried out in may 2010 as part of the hifistars key program .",
    "we used the hifi instrument in dual beam switch ( dbs ) mode to target 10 rotational transitions of water vapor .",
    "the list of observed transitions , and the details of each observation , are given in table 1 .",
    "the telescope beam was centered on irc+10216 at coordinates @xmath23 , @xmath24 ( j2000 ) , and the reference positions were located at offsets of 3@xmath25 on either side of the source .",
    "the data were processed using the standard hifi pipeline to level 2 , providing fully calibrated spectra with the intensities expressed as antenna temperature and the frequencies in the frame of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) . for five of the ten observed transitions",
    ", we used a pair of local oscillator ( lo ) frequencies , separated by a small offset , to confirm the assignment of any observed spectral feature to either the upper or lower sideband of the ( double side band ) hifi receivers .",
    "the resultant spectra were coadded so as to recover the signal - to - noise ratio that would have been obtained at a single lo setting .",

    "the integrated antenna temperatures and line fluxes are given for each detected transition of water vapor in table 2 , together with the energy of the upper state .",
    "the hifi instrument used for these observations provides a spectral resolution ( 1.1  mhz for the wide band spectrometer ) that is much superior to that of the pacs or spire instruments ; this property of hifi typically provides for the unambiguous identification of strong lines , and yields spectral line profiles that can be used to probe the kinematics of the outflowing gas . in figures 1 and 2",
    ", we present the spectra obtained for each of the ten detected water vapor transitions , each smoothed to a spectral resolution of @xmath30 to improve the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "the lower four panels in figure 2 show comparison spectra for one transition each of the molecules co , @xmath31 , sio and sis ; taking advantage of the wide bandwidth of the hifi receivers ( 4 ghz for @xmath32  ghz and 2.4 ghz for @xmath33  ghz ) , we observed these lines simultaneously with nearby water transitions . in figures 1 and 2 ,",
    "the blue line superposed on each spectrum shows the profile of the @xmath14 ground - state transition of ortho - water .",
    "although a full analysis of the spectral line profiles will be the subject of a future publication , several features are obvious from an inspection of the spectra .",
    "most of the water lines share a distinctive profile that is quite dissimilar from those of either the @xmath34co or @xmath29co transitions .",
    "in particular , the blue sides of the water lines are very similar to the nearly parabolic profile shown by @xmath35 , while the red sides are more similar to that of the @xmath17 line , which shows the more rectangular profile expected of an optically - thin line . in these respects ,",
    "the typical water line profiles are most similar to that of the silicon monoxide line shown in figure 2 .",
    "the observed asymmetry in the line profiles likely reflects an asymmetry in the distribution of the emitting h@xmath9o and sio , perhaps suggesting a common origin . the highest excitation water line to have been detected in our study , the 1162.912  ghz transition , exhibits a profile that is rather different from the typical water line profile , with a narrow core that is similar to that present in the sis 1102.029  ghz line profile ; here , emission from the acceleration zone",
    "may be implicated .",
    "in addition , the other water lines typically show a small narrow emission bump near the systemic velocity of the source , perhaps also representing emission from material that has not yet been fully accelerated .",

    "in figure 3 , we compare the measured line fluxes tabulated in table 2 with the predictions of the gnm models . here , the observed line fluxes are represented by black crosses for each of the ten detected transitions , ordered from left to right in increasing energy of the upper state , and the gnm predictions are shown by the solid lines for various values of the inner radius , @xmath18 , of the water emitting region .",
    "these predictions were  calibrated \" by adjusting the assumed water abundance to match the 557 ghz line flux detected by swas .",
    "clearly , the best fit to the data is obtained for the smallest value of @xmath18 considered by gnm , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , but even for that value the model _ underpredicts _ the relative strengths of the transitions of highest excitation .",
    "thus , our hifi observations confirm the inference drawn by d10  from the detection of high - lying water rotational lines with pacs and spire  about the spatial distribution of water vapor ; water is clearly present at distances smaller than @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) from the star .",
    "the presence of water that close to the star definitively falsifies the model proposed by ford & neufeld ( 2001 ) , in which the origin of the observed water vapor was the vaporization of icy comets in a kuiper belt analog , because any icy object ( at least of small size and on a circular orbit ) within @xmath54 would have been vaporized before irc+10216 ascended the agb .",
    "the models proposed by willacy ( 2004 ; i.e. fischer - tropsch catalysis ) and particularly ac06 ( production via radiative association in an outer shell ) are similarly excluded .",
    "the fact that the 1113  ghz / 557  ghz line ratio is in good agreement with the gnm model implies that the ortho - to - para ratio is close to 3 , the value assumed in the model .",
