    "for convenience of notation , in the sequel we set @xmath6 in the non - divergence case .    with the operator @xmath7 in or , we study the following boundary value problems of dirichlet type : @xmath8 where @xmath9 for the divergence case and @xmath10 is the parabolic boundary of @xmath2 ( see definition [ parabolic_boundary ] below ) .",
    "we prove that there exist unique solutions to the dirichlet problems when the domain satisfies the exterior measure condition and the boundary data is zero ( @xmath11 ) . in the non - divergence case , solutions satisfy the equation in the strong sense , and are locally in @xmath12 , @xmath13 . while in the divergence case",
    ", they are understood in the weak sense . in both cases , solutions are continuous up to the boundary . the coefficients which we consider have two features .",
    "first , concerning the leading coefficients , while in the divergence case we do not impose any regularity assumptions , in the non - divergence case we assume that they have vanishing mean oscillations ( vmo ) with respect to the spacial variables and merely measurable with respect to the time variable .",
    "second , the lower - order coefficients may blow up near the boundary with a certain optimal growth condition .",
    "indeed , there is an extensive literature on the existence of solutions to the boundary value problem in a straight cylindrical domain with lower - order coefficients which are bounded or in certain sobolev spaces .",

    "one may find related results in fichera @xcite , oleinik @xcite , kohn ",
    "nirenberg @xcite , and krylov @xcite , where , under certain assumptions , the existence , uniqueness , and regularity of solutions were discussed .",
    "the solutions to parabolic equations in non - divergence form considered here are called @xmath14-strong solutions in @xcite , where the authors treated various types of solutions to nonlinear equations .",
    "we note that in @xcite crandall , kocan , and wich considered equations in a cylindrical domain satisfying a uniform exterior cone condition and the @xmath14-strong solutions are locally in @xmath12 , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is a number close to @xmath17 .",
    "we also mention that in @xcite lieberman treated a similar problem for a non - divergence elliptic operator in a cylindrical domain with blowup lower - order coefficients in weighed hlder spaces .",
    "as noted above , in the non - divergence case we assume that the leading coefficients are in a class of vmo functions .",
    "the study of elliptic and parabolic equations with vmo coefficients was initiated by chiarenza , frasca , and longo @xcite , and continued in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the class of leading coefficients in this paper was introduced by krylov @xcite in the context of parabolic equations in the whole space .",
    "see also @xcite for further development , the results of which we shall use in the proof .    for divergence form equations in time - varying domains ,",
    "yong @xcite proved the unique existence of weak solutions by using a penalization method when the domain satisfies the exterior measure condition ( definition [ a ] ) and its cross section at time @xmath18 is simply connected .",
    "he considered equations with a non - zero initial condition , and coefficients and the data @xmath19 are in some suitable lebesgue spaces , so that the weak solutions are actually hlder continuous up to the boundary . later in @xcite brown et al .",
    "obtained a similar solvability result in a parabolic lipschitz time - varying domain with bounded measurable coefficients and more general square integrable data .",
    "one may refer to lions @xcite for existence results in an abstract framework .",
    "recently , byun and wang @xcite obtained certain @xmath14-estimates for equations in time - varying @xmath20-reifenberg domains .",
    "we also refer the reader to @xcite and the references therein for other results about boundary value problems in time - varying domains .",
