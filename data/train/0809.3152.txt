    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) introduces many additional flavored particles ",
    "one scalar squark ( slepton ) superpartner for each of the chiral quark ( lepton ) fields .",
    "if light , their presence forces us to fine - tune the parameters of the mssm in order to satisfy all experimental constraints .",
    "this is the so - called mssm flavor puzzle .",
    "for instance , the extensive and precise data from b and k physics on flavor - changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) requires limiting squark - induced flavor mixings , including the possible additional cp - violating phases occurring there .",
    "similarly , the non - observation of lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) transitions like @xmath0 restricts the acceptable level of flavor - mixing in the slepton sector . in these contexts , the minimal flavor violation ( mfv )",
    "hypothesis  @xcite aims at restoring naturalness , by automatically limiting the maximal amount of flavor mixings in both the squark and slepton sectors ( for phenomenological applications in the mssm , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "there is yet another , more puzzling consequence of the presence of the squarks and sleptons .",
    "these scalar particles can be used to write down renormalizable yukawa - type interactions violating baryon ( @xmath1 ) and lepton ( @xmath2 ) numbers , which then drive proton decay at tree - level .",
    "this is a severe problem given the current experimental bounds on the proton lifetime , well - beyond 10@xmath3 years for most decay modes .",
    "these bounds are actually so tight that the mssm is usually equipped with an ad - hoc symmetry , r - parity  @xcite , which simply forbids all the @xmath4 and @xmath5 interactions . in this talk",
    ", we will present a different approach , in which all these couplings are not discarded outright . instead ,",
    "since these @xmath4 and @xmath5 interactions are also necessarily flavor - changing , proton stability will be considered as a manifestation of the mssm flavor puzzle .",
    "then , mfv will be called in to constrain all the r - parity violating couplings , by using exactly the same strategy as for fcnc . that mfv is a viable alternative to r - parity",
    "will finally emerge naturally  @xcite , and will force a reassessment of possible supersymmetric signals at colliders .",
    "the formulation of mfv is detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and is only sketched here . to start with , one observes that the three generations of ( s)quarks and ( s)leptons have identical gauge interactions .",
    "in other words , the gauge sector of the mssm exhibits a global @xmath6 flavor - symmetry , one @xmath7 for each of the quark and lepton superfields  @xcite @xmath8 of course , this symmetry is broken in many sectors of the mssm  specifically , by the r - parity conserving and violating superpotential and soft susy breaking couplings . however , at present , the only observed breakings of @xmath9 are the non - equality of quark and lepton masses , and their mixings . all these entirely derive from the usual yukawa couplings @xmath10 , introduced in the mssm through the superpotential @xmath11 ( up to neutrino masses and mixings , discussed later ) @xmath12 therefore , the starting point of mfv is to assume that these yukawa interactions actually represent the maximal flavor - symmetry breakings allowed in the full mssm .",
    "this does not mean that the other mssm sectors where @xmath9 is broken are ruled out , but forces all the parameters occurring there to be related to the yukawa couplings . to systematically investigate these relationships ,",
    "mfv is formulated as a symmetry principle : the yukawa interactions in eq.([w ] ) are formally @xmath9-invariant if the yukawa couplings are promoted to spurion fields , i.e. are made to transform under @xmath9 just such as to balance the transformations of the quark and lepton superfields : @xmath13 these yukawa spurions are then used to parametrize all the flavor - breaking couplings of the mssm as formally @xmath9-invariant .",
    "once this step is complete , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are frozen back to their physical values , thereby obtaining predictions for the strength of these couplings under mfv .    having reconstructed all the flavor - breaking couplings in terms of the yukawa couplings , they all become non - generic .",
    "they exhibit highly hierarchical structures directly inherited from those of the quark and lepton masses , as well as of the ckm matrix . in this way",
    ", the fine - tunings required to satisfy the experimental constraints on fcnc and lfv transitions are to a large extent automatically achieved , and are just as natural ( or unnatural ) as the yukawa couplings themselves . in this sense , mfv does not explain the origin of the flavor structures , but reduces them to the minimal irreducible set of elementary flavor - breaking structures shown in eq.([yukawas ] ) .",
    "the gauge quantum numbers of the quark and lepton superfields are such that possible renormalizable @xmath4 and @xmath5 couplings have intrinsically different properties under the flavor group @xmath9 .",
    "indeed , while it is immediately possible to parametrize the former , @xmath17 , in terms of yukawa spurions , for example as @xmath18 the latter are forbidden as long as @xmath19 . in other words",
    ", the charged lepton yukawa spurion @xmath16 alone does not permit to write the @xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 couplings as @xmath23-invariants .    to account for the tiny neutrino masses without introducing unnaturally small numbers ,",
    "we supplement the mssm with a seesaw mechanism of type i , by adding right - handed neutrino terms @xmath24 to the superpotential  @xcite . though this formally extends the flavor symmetry group to @xmath25",
    ", the heavy @xmath26 fields never occur at low - energy and only the spurion combinations which are singlets under @xmath27 are relevant . expanding in the inverse right - handed neutrino mass matrix @xmath28 , these are @xmath29 the unsuppressed spurion , @xmath30 , which tunes lfv effects as in the usual supersymmetric seesaw  @xcite , transforms as @xmath31 under @xmath23 , and is thus of no help to write the @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 couplings as @xmath23-invariants . the only way to get flavor - symmetric operators is to use the neutrino mass spurion , @xmath35 , which transforms as @xmath36 .",
    "for example , the @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 couplings can be written as @xmath37 in fact , since the 6 is symmetric , while @xmath38-tensors are antisymmetric , additional @xmath16 insertions are needed to get non - vanishing contributions , e.g. @xmath39 .",
    "we thus arrive at the conclusion that all @xmath5 couplings are suppressed by the tiny neutrino masses as well as by the small charged - lepton masses .",
    "to ensure that mfv is sufficient to prevent a too fast proton decay , we must construct all the possible @xmath40-invariant operators , and check that all experimental bounds  @xcite are passed .",
    "we will not go through this analysis here ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but rather take a simple illustrative example : the s - channel decay process shown in fig.[fig1].@xmath41 , whose corresponding experimental bound is @xmath42/300\\,gev)^2\\;,\\label{eq5b}\\ ] ] for @xmath43 , @xmath44 .",
    "further , only the following three representative mfv operators for the @xmath34 and @xmath45 couplings are kept ( with @xmath46 ) : @xmath47 freezing the spurions to their physical values , the mfv prediction for the combination of couplings of fig.[fig1].@xmath41 reads @xmath48 ( assuming normal hierarchy , with @xmath49 ) .",
    "several suppression factors are immediately apparent .",
    "besides the proportionality to the neutrino mass ( actually , to the mass - difference ) , there are several light - quark mass factors , as well as ckm matrix elements , which together account for about half of the overall suppression .",
    "they all arise from the antisymmetry of the @xmath38-tensors , which forces the amplitude to be sensitive to the three generations .",
    "these two mechanisms neutrino mass factor & @xmath38-tensor antisymmetry are sufficient to suppress proton decay below the current experimental limits .",
    "all the bounds are easily satisfied for small to moderate @xmath50 . for larger @xmath50 values ,",
    "several weaker suppression mechanisms could be at play  heavier lightest neutrino , gim - like interferences , restricting the broken flavor @xmath51 s , reducing the mfv coefficients @xmath52 , ... , see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details .",
    "mfv is a viable alternative to r - parity , and can give rise to very distinctive experimental signatures .",
    "proton decay is an obvious target , since it can be quite close to the current experimental bound , but replacing r - parity by mfv can have profound consequences also in other sectors , in particular for susy searches at the lhc .    )",
    "example of a tree - level , s - channel proton decay mechanism .",
    "@xmath53 ) example of corrections to fcnc processes tuned by the @xmath4 couplings .",
    "@xmath54@xmath55 ) possible consequences of @xmath4 couplings with mfv strength : @xmath54 ) single stop resonant production  @xcite and @xmath56 ) its associated single gluino production  @xcite , @xmath57 ) top production from @xmath58 and @xmath59 decays  @xcite , and @xmath60@xmath55 ) possible @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 lsp decay cascades  @xcite.,width=566 ]    all possible signals are driven by the @xmath4 couplings , @xmath64 , since those violating @xmath2 are proportional to neutrino masses , and thus tiny ( @xmath65 , @xmath33 and @xmath66 ) .",
    "mfv predicts a very strong hierarchy for @xmath45 : @xmath67 so that only the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 couplings are significant .",
    "this immediately implies that the impacts on fcnc are negligible , since at least two couplings with different flavor indices are needed . specifically , the amplitudes for the diagrams shown in fig.[fig1].@xmath53 scale as  @xcite : @xmath71 to be compared with @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 for the standard model contributions . at colliders ,",
    "the situation is much more favorable .",
    "the most obvious processes induced by @xmath75 are shown in fig.[fig1].@xmath54@xmath55 .",
    "most of these signatures depend strongly on the precise mass spectrum of the mssm , and have already been analyzed in details  @xcite , though not within the mfv context yet .",
    "for example , whether the lsp decays in the detector or not depends on its nature  @xcite , since it may need to go through a lengthy cascade before reaching the @xmath75 couplings to finally decay ( see fig.[fig1].@xmath60@xmath55 ) .",
    "the mfv hypothesis accounts simultaneously for the non - observation of new physics effects in flavor transitions , and for the tremendously long proton lifetime .",
    "the latter is then understood as a direct consequence of the smallness of the neutrino masses and of the large hierarchies among quark masses and within the ckm matrix .",
    "even if the origin of the flavor structures is left aside by mfv , naturalness is restored for all the flavor - dependent couplings of the mssm . in particular",
    ", it now appears rather unnatural to allow for @xmath76 r - parity violating couplings , since such values correspond to breakings of the flavor - symmetry group that are many orders of magnitude larger than those due to the yukawa couplings .    in view of these successes of mfv ,",
    "whether r - parity should be imposed or not needs to be reassessed .",
    "indeed , the proton decay puzzle is generally thought to be so serious that one is ready to accept the thorough alteration of the mssm phenomenology induced by r - parity  think in particular of the typical , but not experimentally friendly , topologies of susy events at the lhc .",
    "once proton decay is taken care of by mfv , the motivations for nevertheless imposing r - parity have to be found elsewhere . in this respect ,",
    "a few of the relevant issues for or against r - parity are : ( 1 ) some dimension - five operators can induce proton decay even if r - parity conserving  @xcite . on the other hand , they are again very suppressed by mfv .",
    "( 2 ) in grand unified theories , r - parity is often built in , or nevertheless required because their smaller flavor - symmetry group  @xcite impeaches the mfv suppression to be as powerful .",
    "still , it is fair to say that building a viable gut with low - energy mfv has , up to now , not been fully investigated .",
    "( 3 ) without r - parity , the lsp of the mssm is no longer a viable dark matter candidate .",
    "remember though that there must be physics beyond the mssm , since it is lacking a dynamical susy - breaking mechanism .",
    "( 4 ) having at hand several @xmath1-violating couplings , which may also violate cp , could open new paths towards baryogenesis .    in conclusion",
    ", since the viability of the mssm is no longer in the balance , whether r - parity is present in nature or not is much less clear , and simple tree - level resonant productions of supersymmetric particles at the lhc may be just around the corner .",
