    "in the past few years , @xmath1-models in low dimensions have become an increasingly important area of research , often arising as approximate models in the contexts of both particle and solid state physics .",
    "they have been used in the construction of high-@xmath2 superconductivity and the quantum hall effect ; in two euclidean dimensions , they appear to be the low - dimensional analogues of four - dimensional yang - mills theories .",
    "but only very special @xmath1-models in ( 2 + 1)-d are integrable @xcite , and the physically relevant lorentz - invariant models are not amongst them ; in these cases , recourse to numerical evolution must be made . the simplest lorentz - invariant model in ( 2 + 1)-d is the @xmath0 model , which involves three real scalar fields , @xmath3(@xmath4)@xmath5\\{@xmath6(@xmath4 ) , @xmath7=1,2,3 } , with the constraint that @xmath3 lies on the unit sphere @xmath8 : @xmath9 subject to this constraint , the lagrangian density and the corresponding equations of motion are @xmath10 @xmath11\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}+\\partial^{2}_{x } \\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}+\\partial^{2}_{y}\\mbox{\\boldmath $ \\phi$}.    \\label{eqmp}\\ ] ] note that we are concerned with the model in ( 2 + 1)-d : @xmath12 , with the speed of light set equal to unity .",
    "an alternative and convenient formulation of the model is in terms of one independent complex field , @xmath13 , related to the fields @xmath6 via @xmath14 in this formulation , the lagrangian density and the corresponding equations of motion read ( asterisk denotes complex conjugation ) @xmath15 and @xmath16}{1+|w|^{2}}. \\label{eqmw}\\ ] ] the problem is completely specified by giving the boundary conditions . as usual",
    "we take @xmath17 where @xmath3@xmath18(@xmath19 ) is independent of the polar angle @xmath20 . in ( 2 + 1)-d",
    "this condition ensures a finite potential energy , whereas in two euclidean dimensions , _",
    "i.e. _ , when @xmath3 is independent of time , this leads to the finiteness of the action , which is precisely the requirement for quantization in terms of path integrals . as shown by several people @xcite , any rational function @xmath21 or @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , is a static solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqmw ] ) .",
    "these are the instantons of the model , and can be regarded as _",
    "static _ solitons of the same model in ( 2 + 1)-d .",
    "the simplest one - soliton solution , @xmath24 ( @xmath25 is a free parameter determining the size of @xmath13 ) , has been numerically studied by leese _ et.al _",
    "when viewed as an evolving structure in ( 2 + 1)-d , the soliton has been found to be unstable ; any small perturbation , either explicit or introduced by the discretization procedure , changes its size .",
    "this instability is associated with the conformal invariance of the @xmath0 lagrangian in two dimensions .",
    "the @xmath0 solitons , however , can be stabilized through a judicious introduction of a scale into the model , thereby breaking its conformal invariance .",
    "as explained below , in the present article we study this problem following the methods of a previous investigation @xcite , but considering a different potential - like term and restricting ourselves to the systems initially at rest .",
    "using the @xmath13-formulation , our skyrme model is defined by the lorentz - invariant lagragian density @xmath26\\nonumber \\\\ & -&4\\theta_{2}\\frac{|w-\\lambda|^{8}}{(1+|w|^{2})^{4 } } , \\label{lds}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is given by eq .",
    "( [ ldw ] ) and @xmath28,@xmath29 are real parameters with dimensions of length squared and inverse length squared , respectively ; they introduce a scale into the model , which is no longer conformal invariant . if the size of the solitons is appropriately chosen , it is energetically unfavourable for the solitons to change it .",
    "the @xmath28-term is the ( 2 + 1)-d analogue of the skyrme term , whereas the @xmath29-term is a potential - like one .",
    "unlike the former , the latter term is highly nonunique @xcite .",
    "the field equation corresponding to the above lagrangian can be cast into the form    @xmath30}{1+|w|^{2 } } \\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{4\\theta_{1}}{(1+|w|^{2})^{2}}[2w^{*}_{tx } w_{t}w_{x}+2w^{*}_{ty}w_{t}w_{y}-2w^{*}_{xy}w_{x}w_{y } \\nonumber \\\\ & + & w^{*}_{xx}(w_{y}^{2}-w_{t}^{2})+w^{*}_{yy}(w_{x}^{2 } -w_{t}^{2})-w^{*}_{tt}(w_{x}^{2}+w_{y}^{2})\\nonumber \\\\ & + & w_{xx}(|w_{t}|^{2}-|w_{y}|^{2})+w_{yy}(|w_{t}|^{2 } -|w_{x}|^{2})+w_{tt}(|w_{x}|^{2}+|w_{y}|^{2})\\nonumber \\\\ & + & w_{xy}(w_{x}^{*}w_{y}+w_{y}^{*}w_{x})-w_{tx}(w_{t}^{*}w_{x } + w_{x}^{*}w_{t})-w_{ty}(w_{t}^{*}w_{y } + w_{y}^{*}w_{t})\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{2w}{1+|w|^{2}}((w^{*}_{t}w_{y}-w^{*}_{y}w_{t})^{2 } + ( w^{*}_{x}w_{t}-w^{*}_{t}w_{x})^{2}-(w^{*}_{x}w_{y } -w^{*}_{y}w_{x})^{2})]\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\frac{16 \\theta_{2}|w-\\lambda|^{2}}{(1+|w|^{2})^{3 } } , \\label{eqms}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the notation @xmath31 , @xmath32 , _",
    "etc_. , has been used .",
    "it is straightforward to check that @xmath33 is a static solution of eq .",
    "( [ eqms ] ) , provided the following relation holds : @xmath34{2 \\theta_{1}/\\theta_{2}}}{a - b}. \\label{fix}\\ ] ]    now @xmath25 , which characterizes the size of the instanton @xmath13 , is no longer a free parameter .",
    "it is fixed by eq .",
    "( [ fix ] ) .",
    "the instanton , with its size thus fixed , is usually referred to as a ` skyrmion ' . unlike the ordinary @xmath0 case @xcite , where the instanton changes its size as time elapses , we expect our skyrmion to be stable . in reference 5 ,",
    "a similar question was studied using @xmath35 for the potential - like term , with the skyrme field given by @xmath36 , where @xmath37{2 \\theta_{1}/\\theta_{2}}$ ] .",
    "to perform our numerical simulations we employ the fouth - order runge - kuttamethod , and approximate the spatial derivatives by finite differences ; the laplacian is evaluated using the nine - point formula .",
    "all computations were performed on the workstations at durham , on a fixed 201@xmath38201 lattice with spatial and time steps @xmath39=@xmath40=0.02 and @xmath41=0.005 .",
    "every few iterations we rescaled the fields @xmath42 .",
    "we also included along the boundary a narrow strip to absorb the various radiation waves , thus reducing their effects on the skyrmions via the reflections from the boundary .",
    "as time elapses , this absorption of radiation manifests itself through a small decrease of the total energy , which gradually stabilizes as the radiation waves are gradually absorbed .",
    "we choose the parameters to have the values : @xmath28=0.015006250 , @xmath29=0.1250 , @xmath7=0.75 and @xmath43=0.05 which , according to eq .",
    "( [ fix ] ) , set @xmath25=1 .",
    "the numerical evolution shows that the skyrmion s shape , of which a representative picture is given in the upper half of figure 1 , practically does not change as a function of time .",
    "the maximum of the total energy density , which is related to the soliton size , starts off at the value 128.5 and , after some radiation waves are emitted , stabilizes at @xmath44 129.5 ( see lower half of figure 1 ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the analytical result , as the expression for the maximum of the total energy density , namely , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , yields 129.3 , the ` canonical size ' .    in figure 2",
    "are exhibited some kinetic energy density waves .",
    "they propagate out to the boundary at the speed of light , leaving the region where the skyrmion is located essentially free of kinetic energy .",
    "the smallness of the kinetic energy indicates that the field given by eq .",
    "( [ s ] ) remains almost perfectly static .",
    "for example , the amplitude of the total energy density , at @xmath19=0 , is positioned at @xmath47=(0 , 0.4000 ) and , for @xmath19=10 , it has been slowly shifted to ( 0 , 0.4013 ) .",
    "so , as expected , our skyrmion appears to be stable under perturbations brought about by the discretization procedure .",
    "these results agree with those of reference @xcite , where the skyrmion was positioned at the centre of the grid , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath47=0 , which , as one can easily check , corresponds to a skyrmion given by @xmath24 or @xmath48 .",
    "in order to study the stability problem further , we are currently performing simulations with the same @xmath49-values but setting @xmath50 .",
    "this corresponds to initial conditions that are no longer those of the static solution .",
    "we hope some concrete results will be available in the future .",
    "let us now consider the case where two instantons are put on a lattice .",
    "we consider the field @xmath51 with @xmath25=1 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and let it evolve .",
    "one can readily verify that the above field configuration is not a solution of the equations of motion , and hence it evolves when started off at rest .",
    "our simulations have shown that , at the initial time , @xmath54 is well above the canonical size as determined in the last sub - section .",
    "as soon as the evolution in time begins the solitons shake off some kinetic energy and alter their size by getting broader ; @xmath54 decreases and then undergoes damped - oscillations around a value very close to the canonical one . as this happens , the solitons slowly move away from each other , exhibiting the presence of a repulsive force between them .",
    "by @xmath55 , the amplitude of the above - mentioned oscillations is quite small , and @xmath54 eventually stabilizes near the expected canonical value .",
    "typical pictures for this case are displayed in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "we have performed a numerical study of the time evolution of the general one - instanton solutions of our version of the skyrme model in ( 2 + 1)-d , confirming some of the properties previously seen in other versions of the model .",
    "the extra terms added to the ordinary non - linear @xmath0 model break its conformal invariance and stabilize the solitons .",
    "the changes of soliton size and position are negligible as time progresses .",
    "also , the time evolution of the two - skyrmion configuration has showed us that , like in the previously studied model , the forces between the skyrmions are repulsive .",
