    "@xmath27 , on the other hand , is finite only for @xmath28 whereas it diverges for @xmath29 when @xmath23 . by a combination of different techniques like bosonization , conformal field theory , bethe ansatz as well as numerical results ,",

    "the differences between our and takahashi s result can be explained as follows : whereas in ref .   the sum in eq .",

    "interestingly , the terms in the susceptibility up to @xmath72 remain unaffected , i.e. , these terms are not influenced by the behavior of the correlation function at short - distances .",
    "in fact , we might trust our spine - wave approximation only in the long - wavelength limit where the spin - wave interaction is small . in our one - loop approximation",

    "( [ eq_mswt3 ] ) is also small and @xmath73 . in this limit",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ eq_mswt2 ] ) becomes equivalent to the one for ideal non - interacting spin waves .    for these reasons we can not expect that the mswt gives reasonable results if we try to calculate local quantities for obc near the boundary .",
    "we observed that neither a local constraint @xmath74 nor the correlation function @xmath75 can be calculated without inconsistencies .",
    "for example , if we calculate the correlation function for obc explicitly we find a constant term which vanishes only if we set @xmath76 exactly .",
    "however , the condition ( [ eq_mswt5 ] ) still requires corrections to @xmath46 as given in ( [ eq_mswt9 ] ) .",
    "far enough away from the boundaries , on the other hand , the correlation function will still behave as in eq .",
    "( [ eq_mswt8 ] ) .",
    "when we perform the sum in ( [ eq_mswt6 ] ) using again this long - distance asymptotics for @xmath71 but in a way appropriate for obc we will already obtain a @xmath17 correction to the susceptibility _ without _ taken the modifications to the correlation function near the boundary into account .",
    "we conjecture that for low temperatures , this term yields @xmath0 .",
    "the physical picture behind this procedure is as follows : we can combine two open chains each of length @xmath77 to one periodic chain of length @xmath78 , where the two additional sites do not couple with their neighbors .",
    "we then carry out the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq_mswt6 ] ) only over one half of the periodic chain , thereby discarding correlations between this subsystem and the rest . doing",
    "so we ignore local differences between pbc and obc .    what makes us confident that this is indeed sufficient to obtain the leading terms in a low - temperature expansion for the boundary susceptibility @xmath0 is that the leading term @xmath79 is universal in the sense that it does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "especially , it is the leading term of @xmath0 for both @xmath3 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite the classical result for the correlation function ( [ eq_mswt10 ] ) has been first obtained by fisher @xcite for an _",
    "open chain_. i.e. , in the classical limit the exponential decay of the correlation function does depend only on @xmath81 and not on @xmath82 alone , although translational invariance is broken !",
    "we therefore conjecture that the leading terms in a low - temperature expansion of the susceptibility for a quantum chain with obc are given by @xmath83 in particular , the boundary susceptibility is given by @xmath84 note that the leading term is identical to the leading term in the classical result ( [ eq_i4 ] ) when @xmath85 are replaced by @xmath86 .",
    "this confirms our expectations . to test if the procedure proposed here gives indeed the right corrections to the classical result we will check formula ( [ eq_mswt13 ] ) against numerical data for the @xmath3 quantum model in the following section",
    "in a system with obc the one - point correlation function @xmath87 is no longer a constant because translational invariance is broken . we define @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the magnetization per site in the system with pbc and @xmath90 is the distance from the boundary .",
    "the local boundary susceptibility is then given by @xmath91 and the total boundary susceptibility @xmath0 can be obtained by @xmath92 this means that we can calculate @xmath0 by considering only a local quantity which is particularly useful in numerical calculations where it is difficult to obtain the @xmath17 contribution directly . particularly suited for this purpose",
