    "synthesis of messenger rna , a linear heteropolymer , using the corresponding template dna , is called transcription ; it is carried out by a molecular machine called rna polymerase ( rnap ) @xcite .",
    "this machine also exploits the dna template as a filamentous track for its motor - like movement consuming input chemical energy @xcite .",
    "polymerization of each rna by a rnap takes place normally in three stages : ( a ) initiation at a specific ` start ' site ( also called initiation site ) on the template , ( b ) step - by - step elongation of the rna , by one nucleotide in each forward step of the rnap motor , and ( c ) termination at a specific ` stop ' site ( also called termination site ) on the template . for the sake of convenience , throughout this paper we refer to the segment of the template dna between the start and the stop sites as a ` gene ' .",
    "rnaps move from @xmath0 to the @xmath1 direction on a single strand of dna .",
    "often multiple rnaps transcribe the same gene simultaneously . in such rnap traffic @xcite ,",
    "all the rnaps engaged simultaneously in the transcription process move in the same direction while polymerizing identical copies of a rna , all by initiating transcription from the same start site and , normally , terminating at the same stop site . since any segment of the template dna covered by one rnap is not accessible simultaneously to any other rnap",
    ", this steric exclusion gives rise to nontrivial spatio - temporal organization of rnaps in rnap traffic .",
    "theoretical models of this kinetic process @xcite as well as traffic of cytoskeletal motor proteins @xcite have been developed over the last few years by appropriately adapting , and extending , asymmetric exclusion process ( asep ) @xcite , a popular model in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics that we describe briefly in the next section .",
    "in this paper we report theoretical studies of more complex rnap - traffic phenomena that are believed to play important regulatory roles in living cells @xcite .",
    "these phenomena arise from simultaneous transcription of two overlapping genes either on the same dna template or two genes on the two adjacent single strands of a duplex ( double - stranded ) dna . in the former case ( see fig.[fig - model](a ) ) , traffic is entirely uni - directional although rnaps transcribing different genes polymerize two distinct species of rna molecules by starting ( and stopping ) at different sites on the same template dna strand .",
    "in contrast , in the latter case ( see fig.[fig - model](b ) ) , rnap traffic in the two adjacent `` lanes '' move in opposite directions transcribing the respective distinct genes . in both these situations the phenomenon of suppressive influence of one transcriptional process on the other",
    "is called transcriptional interference ( ti ) @xcite .    in general",
    ", a rnap at the initiation , elongation or termination stage of transcription of one gene can suppress the initiation , or elongation ( or induce premature termination ) of that of the other gene by another rnap @xcite .",
    "in other words , the stages of transcription of the two interfering rnaps define a distinct mode of interference .",
    "different modes of interference have been assigned different names like `` occlusion '' , `` collision '' , `` sitting duck interference '' , etc @xcite .",
    "many pairs of interfering transcription processes are known to form a bistable switch : switching on a high level of transcription of one of the two genes can switch off the other by its suppressive effect and vice versa @xcite .",
    "thus , the ti of the two overlapping genes constitute a `` self - regulatory '' circuit @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a unified theoretical framework that , for a given relative orientation of two genes , captures all possible modes of ti . using this theoretical model",
    "we investigate the effects of ( i ) geometric parameters , like the relative orientation and spatial extent of the overlap of the two genes , and ( ii ) kinetic parameters , like the rates of initiations , terminations , unhindered elongation as well as those of passing or premature detachments of rnaps up on close encounter , etc . on ( a ) the spatio - temporal organization of the rnaps , and ( b ) the overall rates of synthesis of full - length transcripts of both the genes .",
    "our systematic and comprehensive theoretical analysis throws light on the mechanisms of various kinetic aspects of ti phenomena observed in different kingdoms of life ( i.e. , transcription by bacteriophage rnap as well as by those of bacteria and higher organisms ) .",
    "more precisely , we establish the rnap traffic conditions necessary for the switch - like regulation of two mutually interfering transcriptional processes .",
    "we also demonstrate how deviations from these traffic conditions lead to various other types of outcome of ti .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec - model ]",
    "we describe the models of co - directional and contra - directional ti .",
    "we explain how various special cases of the general framework correspond to known examples of ti caused by bacteriophage rnaps and those by non - phage rnaps in bacteria or higher organisms . for these models",
    "we formulate the master equations under mean - field approximation ( mfa ) and the methods for their numerical solutions .",
    "we briefly discuss the algorithms adopted for direct computer ( monte carlo ) simulations that we carry out for testing the validity of the mfa . in section [ sec - codir ]",
    "we present the quantitative results for co - directional ti .",
    "next , in the two subsections of section [ sec - contradir ] we present our results for two distinct special cases of contra - directional ti , namely for bacteriophage and non - bacteriophage rnap traffic . in section [ sec - conclusion ]",

    "we represent a single - stranded dna ( ssdna ) by a linear chain ( i.e. , a one - dimensional lattice ) of equispaced sites .",
    "each site of this lattice denotes a nucleotide which is a monomeric subunit of the dna track .",
    "the chain serves both as the template and track for the respective rnap motors that are engaged in the transcription of genes encoded on it . for modeling ti of two genes",
    "we incorporate two interfering taseps each characterized by the respective on- and off - ramps ; two distinct species of rnap motors use the corresponding distinct ramps . for modeling co - directional ti",

    "but , for modeling transcription of two genes encoded on the two adjacent strands of a duplex dna , we use two antiparallel lattices on which the contra - directional traffic of the two groups of motors take place",

    "we represent each rnap by a hard rod , i.e. , an extended particle , of length @xmath7 in the units of nucleotide length , i.e. , it covers @xmath7 successive sites of the lattice simultaneously .",
    "we denote the position of a rnap transcribing gene 1 by the lattice site at which the _ leftmost _ unit of the rod is located while the next @xmath8 sites of the lattice are merely _ covered _ by the rnap .",

    "but , if the lattice site @xmath3 denotes the position of a rnap transcribing the gene 2 it covers the @xmath7 sites @xmath10 .",
    "the rnaps interact with each other with only hard core repulsion that is captured by imposing the condition that no lattice site is allowed to be covered by more than one rnap simultaneously .",
    "we identify two sites separated by @xmath2 nucleotides as the start sites for the two genes ; @xmath2 is a non - negative integer ; negative @xmath2 essentially corresponds to interchanging the labels 1 and 2 of the two genes ( see fig.[fig - model ] ) . in all figures in this paper",
    "the length of @xmath2 is indicated by the symbol @xmath11 .",
    "a fresh initiation of transcription of a gene , however , is not possible as long as the first @xmath7 sites , starting from the start site of that gene , remain fully or partly covered by any other rnap , irrespective of the identity of the gene that is being transcribed by the latter .",
    "we denote the rates of initiation of transcription of the two genes by @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "whenever @xmath7 successive sites , starting from the start site of a gene on the dna template is vacant , a fresh rnap is allowed to cover those @xmath7 sites thereby initiating the corresponding transcription .",
    "each rnap carries an unique label @xmath13 or @xmath14 depending on which of the two genes it is engaged in transcribing ; the label is assigned to it depending on the start site from where it begins its walk on its track .",
    "irrespective of the actual numerical value of @xmath7 , each rnap can move forward by only one site in each step , provided the target site is not already covered by any other rnap .",
    "single - site stepping rule is motivated by the fact that a rnap must transcribe the successive nucleotides one by one .",
    "unless prematurely detached from its track under special situations that we discuss in section [ sec - contradir ] , a rnap engaged in the transcription of one of the two genes would detach from its track after it reaches the stop site of the corresponding gene and completes synthesis of a full - length transcript .",
    "so far as the rates of the detachment of a rnap from the termination site is concerned , we denote the corresponding rates by @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",

    "the overall rates of synthesis of _ full - length _ transcripts in the steady state are the fluxes @xmath21 and @xmath22 of the rnaps measured at the site of _ termination _ , namely , @xmath23 note that , in the absence of premature detachments , in the steady state the flux of the rnaps are independent of the site on the respective track where fluxes is measured .",
    "but , if premature termination of a gene , induced by head - on collisions , is allowed , the flux of the corresponding rnaps along the track would decrease with increasing distance from the corresponding transcription initiation site .    solving the master equations for @xmath17 numerically under steady state conditions we computed @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and hence , @xmath21 and @xmath22 using the definitions ( [ eq - fdefn ] ) .",

    ", we also carried out extensive direct computer simulations ( monte carlo simulations ) of our model using the same set of parameter values that we used for solving the master equations .",
    "starting from an initial condition with empty lattices , the system was updated for sufficiently long time ( typically , two million time steps ) , while monitoring the flux , to ensure that it reached the steady state .",
    "the steady state data were collected over the next five million time steps . in the computer simulations @xmath21 and @xmath22 were obtained by counting the number of rnaps passing through the respective termination sites per unit time .",
    "the steady - state flux as well as the density profiles of the rnaps presented in this paper are averages of the data collected only in the steady state of the system .",

    ", the rate of transcription of gene 2 is weakly affected by infrequent co - directional close encounters ( `` collisions '' ) and proceeds at a fairly high rate .",

    "however , when two rnaps labelled by two distinct integer indices 1 and 2 ( i.e. , transcribing different genes ) face each other head - on , two distinct consequences can be envisaged .",
    "these two distinct scenarios correspond to two different limiting cases of the general model of contra - directional ti that we report in the next two subsections .    in the first plausible scenario , two rnaps approaching each other on the two adjacent tracks can pass slowly , continuing their respective functions , albeit with a hopping rate that is lower than that in the absence of the obstruction , i.e. , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "we explore the outcomes of ti under different arrangement of the two genes and different rates of the elementary kinetic processes . in this section",
    "first we compare and contrast our model and main results with the earlier tasep - based models of various types of molecular motor traffic ; these include , for example , traffic of cytoskeletal motor proteins , rnap traffic during transcription , ribosome traffic during translation , etc .",
    "finally , we also suggest powerful experimental techniques that are potential candidates for testing our theoretical results reported in this paper .",
    "co - directional and contra - directional two - species tasep , both on a single track and two parallel or anti - parallel tracks , have been studied earlier for purely theoretical consideration as well as for capturing real physical processes @xcite .",
    "but , in almost all those models , barring a few exceptions , under open boundary conditions , a single pair of start and stop sites ( on- and off - ramps ) serve as the entry and exit points for both species of particles .    greulich et al .",
    "@xcite studied more than one tracks where the tasep on the different tracks compete for finite number of particles supplied from a shared reservoir .",
    "thus , unlike our model , the particles on different tracks do not directly hinder movement of each other , but the different taseps affact each other via an indirect influence because of the shared particle resources .",
    "although , in reality , the phenomena studied by kuan and betterton @xcite do not require equal length of the two anti - parallel tracks ( and , hence , start and stop sites of two tracks need not be adjacent ) , for the convenience of mathematical formulation , such equal lengths were assumed .",
    "moreover , in ref.@xcite each motor gets hindered only by the co - moving motors in front on the same track whereas in our model the motors hindered also by oppositely moving motors on the adjacent track .",
    "direct switching of motors from one track to the other was incorporated in ref.@xcite .",
    "besides , motivated by the fact that each microtubule track for cytoskeletal motors consists , normally , of 13 protofilaments each of which serves as a single lane for the motors , lane changing by the motors have also been modelled using appropriate extensions of tasep or equivalent prescriptions @xcite",
    ". direct hopping of a particle from one lattice to an adjoing one , satisfying the exclusion condition , has also been incorporated in a two - lane tasep and related models @xcite .",
    "in contrast , similar direct transfer of a rnap from one ssdna strand to the adjoining ssdna strand is not possible .    furthermore , motivated by cytoskeletal motor traffic , tasep - based models with two distinct species of oppositely moving self - propelled particles @xcite , including that in ref.@xcite ,",
    "allow motors to attach to and detach from any lattice site .",
    "thus , except for quantitative difference in the values of attachment / detachment , the motor kinetics at the two ends of the track were qualitatively no different from those at any other site .",
    "in contrast , for the transcription of a specific gene , rnap motors have to start their walk at pre - designated sites ; attachment at any arbitrary site in between the start and stop sites is not allowed .",
    "although normal error - free transcription would get terminated at a specific stop site , premature termination , caused by head - on collision of two rnaps , was allowed in our model .",
    "in most of the earlier theoretical models on rnap traffic @xcite all the rnaps were engaged in transcribing a single gene ; therefore the traffic was uni - directional and every rnap polymerized identical copies of the rna while a single pair of start - stop sites marked the points of initiation and termination of transcription .",
    "in contrast , in the models reported in this paper two distinct pairs of start - stop sites mark the points of initiation and termination of the respective genes .",
    "moreover , the rna species that gets polymerized by a rnap depends on the sites from which it initiates transcription .",
    "thus copies of two distinct species of rna get synthesized simultaneously by a mixed population of two groups of rnap motors the relative direction of whose movements is dictated by the relative orientation of the two genes .    in our model of ti in co - directional mixed rnap traffic we assumed that a rnap passively waits at its current position if the target nucleotide in front is already covered by another rnap .",
    "the temporarily stalled rnap can resume its forward movement , and the concomitant transcriptional activity , only after its target site is vacated by the rnap immediately in front of it .",
    "we have also ignored the possibility of backtracking of the individual rnap motors @xcite . in future extensions of our model @xcite",
    ", we intend to explore the effects of backtracking @xcite , active re - starting of stalled rnap by a trailing rnap @xcite and , eventually , the other important processes in gene expression to provide a complete quantitative model from `` systems view '' @xcite .",
    "so far we have highlighted the differences between our models of ti and other tasep - based models of various types of molecular motor traffic .",
    "now we also emphasize that the main questions addressed in most of the earlier tasep - based models are also fundamentally different from those addressed in this paper .",
    "the main emphasis here is on the nature of _ regulation _ of transcription of one gene by controlling the level of transcription of another through ti .    in all the earlier theoretical works on ti the effects of the different modes of interference ,",
    "e.g. , occlusion , sitting - duck interference , etc .",
    ", have been studied separately @xcite .",
    "the simple tasep - based unified model that we have developed here not only captures all possible modes of ti and but also accounts for the co - directional and contra - directional traffic of both phage rnaps and non - phage rnaps as various special cases .",
    "the terminology `` bacteriophage '' and `` non - phage '' rnaps have been used in this paper only for the convenience of distinguishing two special cases of our model .",
    "although this terminology is based on some reported experimental characteristics of those two types of rnaps , we do not claim that all bacteriophage and non - phage rnaps must satisfy the properties assigned to the two classes in this paper .",
    "we have already cited examples of traffic of bacteriophage rnaps @xcite and non - phage rnaps @xcite in ti .",
    "moreover , ti is known to be one of the causes of long latency of hiv in infected hosts @xcite .",
    "therefore , our theoretical models also have potential utility in future for quantitative studies of ti .",
    "experimental testing of the theoretical predictions made here need to correlate the overall rate of synthesis of full - length transcripts with the corresponding density profiles of the rnaps .",
