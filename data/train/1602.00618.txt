    "we present a detail analysis of this model in both 2 and 3 dimensions . in particular , we show that this lattice model captures a 2d weyl semi - metallic phase , whose nodes are protected by an anti - unitary operator . in addition , our model also captures a 3d weyl semi - metallic phase , which appears as an intermediate phase between a 3d quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) insulator and a normal insulator ( ni ) .",
    "it is also shown that the porphyrin lattice model can be used as a tight binding model for topological insulator thin film multilayer .",
    "we use this model to simulate the chiral edge states of the 2d system and the surface states ( fermi arcs ) of the 3d system in all the nontrivial topological phases of the system .",
    "in 2d topological insulator ultra - thin film , the hybridization between the top and the bottom layers gives rise to a massive dirac fermion @xcite .",
