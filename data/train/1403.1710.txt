    "the energy density of dark matter ( dm ) occupies about 27 % of the universe . however , its nature is not known yet clearly . recently",
    "two groups independently reported anomalous x - ray line signal at about @xmath0 kev from the analysis of xmn - newton x - ray observatory data of various galaxy clusters and andromeda galaxy  @xcite . in this sense , the x - ray line signal at @xmath0 kev can be explained by a 7 kev dark matter mixing with the active neutrino by angle given by @xmath1 .",
    "this could provide a lot of implications on the nature of dm .",
    "already several works have appeared in various models  @xcite .",
    "due to its too small mixing , the dm can not contribute to the neutrino masses directly . in this letter",
    ", we propose a dirac type neutrino scenario at one - loop level , introducing continuous @xmath2 symmetry  @xcite .",
