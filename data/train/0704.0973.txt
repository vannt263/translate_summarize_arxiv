    "young rotation - powered pulsars typically radiate a large fraction of their spin - down energy at x - ray energies .",
    "observations in this band are thus important to the study of the spin - down evolution of such pulsars and their emission mechanism(s ) .",
    "the study also helps to understand the mechanical energy output of the pulsars into their surroundings , manifested as pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) . to this end , one needs to monitor the spin - down at various evolutionary stages of young pulsars and to measure their energy spectra , both pulsed and unpulsed , with various viewing angles .",
    "however , only a dozen or so of young pulsars with pwne have been identified and studied in detailed so far .",
    "the recently discovered 136  ms pulsar  at the center of the supernova remnant ( snr )  is the latest example of a crab - like pulsar ( camilo et al .",
    "2002 ) . known as the `` bulls - eye '' pulsar , is surrounded by a bright symmetric ring of emission ( lu et al .",
    "2002 ) similar to the toroidal and jet - like structure associated with the crab pulsar , but viewed nearly face - on .",
    "based on the initial timing parameters ,  is the eighth most energetic pulsar known , with a rotational energy loss rate of @xmath8  erg  s@xmath1 , well above the empirical threshold for generating a bright pulsar wind nebula ( @xmath9  erg  s@xmath1 , gotthelf 2004 ) .",
    "such young pulsars are often embedded in observable shell - type remnant which have yet to dissipate .",
    "however , like the crab , g54.1 + 0.3 lacks evidence for a thermal remnant in any waveband ( lu et al .",
    "most likely , the sn ejecta in these two remnants are still expanding into a very low density medium .",
    "in this paper we present the first dedicated x - ray timing and spectral follow - up observations of  since discovery .",
    "previous x - ray results were based on archival data of limited quality .",
    "we use the new data to characterize the pulse shape and energy spectrum and provide a long term ephemeris . throughout the paper , the uncertainties ( statistical fluctuation only )",
    "are quoted at the 68% confidence level .",
    "the pulsar  was observed twice with _ rxte _  on 2002",
    "september 12  14 and on 2002 december 23  25 using a combination of event and instrument modes . for consistency",
    ", we analyze the data taken with the proportional counter array ( pca ) in the good  xenon mode .",
    "pca has a field of view of 1@xmath10 ( fwhm ) , total collecting area of about 6500 @xmath11 , time resolution of 1 @xmath12s , and spectral resolution of @xmath13 at 6 kev .",
    "the data are reduced and analyzed using the _ ftools _ software package version v5.2 .",
    "we filter the data using the standard _ rxte _",
    "criteria , selecting time intervals for which parameters @xmath14 , @xmath15 min , @xmath16 , and the background electron rate @xmath17 .",
    "the effective exposure time after this filtering is 31.7  ks and 41.7  ks for the september and december observations .",
    "since the background of _ rxte _  is high and the spectral resolution is relatively low , the _ rxte _  data is used herein exclusively for timing analysis , selecting photons detected from pca pha channels @xmath18 ( @xmath19  kev ) .",
    "this results in a total of @xmath20 and @xmath21 million counts in the two observations for the subsequent analysis .",
    "the photon arrival times are corrected to the solar system barycenter , based on the de200 solar ephemeris time system and the _ chandra _",
    "j2000 coordinates of j193030.13 + 185214.1 ( lu et al . 2002 ) .",
    "snr  was also observed with _",
    "chandra _  on 2003 june 30 for a total of 58.4 ks .",
    "the pulsar was placed at the aim - point of the front - illuminated acis - i detector .",
    "the ccd chip i3 was operated in continuous - clocking mode ( cc - mode ) , providing a time resolution of 2.85  ms and an one - dimensional imaging , in which the ccd image is integrated along the column direction in each ccd readout cycle .",
    "the photon arrival times are post - processed to account for the spacecraft dithering and sim motion prior to the barycenter correction .",
    "the spectral data are corrected for the effects of cti ( charge transfer inefficiency ) .",
    "however , the spectral gain is not well calibrated in the cc - mode , requiring adjustment in the fitting process ( details are given in  3 ) .",
    "spectral response matrices are generated for the acis - i aimpoint , the location of the pulsar in this observation .",
    "after filtering the data using the standard criteria , the remaining effective exposure is 57.2  ks .",
    "reduction and analysis of the _ chandra _  data are all based on the standard software package _",
    "ciao _ ( v3.2 ) and _ caldb _ ( v3.0.0 ) .",
    "figure  1 presents the geometry of the cc - mode observation overlaid on an archival _ chandra _  x - ray image of snr  g54.1 + 0.3 .",
    "the ccd image is summed along the dimension perpendicular to the marked line which is orientated with a position angle @xmath22 east of north .",
    "the count distribution along this dimension is shown in figure  2 .",
    "the central peak corresponds to the presence of the pulsar , which significantly contributes to the six adjacent pixels , as denoted by the upper horizontal bar .",
    "the neighboring four pixels ( two on each side of the pulsar region ) , marked by the two lower horizontal bars , show the nearly same intensity level in the acis - i3 image - mode data with the pulsar excised .",
    "we therefore select counts falling in the inner six pixels for both our pulsar timing and spectral analysis of the pulsar , while those counts in the outer four pixels are used to estimate the background from the surrounding nebula .",
    "for each observation , we search for the periodic signal of  by folding events around the period extrapolated from the early radio ephemeris of camilo et al ( 2002 ) . for each period folding with a period @xmath23 , a @xmath24 is calculated from the fit to the pulse profile with a constant count rate .",
    "the null hypothesis of no periodic signal can be ruled out when a significant peak is seen in the resultant `` periodogram '' ( @xmath24 vs. @xmath23 ) , which is the case for each of the x - ray observations at a high confidence ( @xmath25 for 10 phase bins ) .",
    "we further fit the peak shape with a gaussian profile to maximize the accuracy of our pulsar period determination ( figure  3 ) .",
    "the centroid of this gaussian is then taken as the best estimate of the pulsar period .",
    "the light curves derived of the _ rxte _  and _ chandra_observations folded at the measured periods are shown in figures .",
    "45 .    to estimate the uncertainties in the period measurements , we use the bootstrap technique of diaconis & efron ( 1983 ) .",
    "this is done as the following : ( 1 ) constructing a new data set of the same total number of counts by re - sampling with replacement from the observed events ; ( 2 ) determining the period with this re - sampled data set in the exactly same way as with the original data ; ( 3 ) repeating the above two steps for 500 times to produce a period distribution ; ( 4 ) using the dispersion of this distribution as an estimate of the 1@xmath26 period uncertainty .",
    "the distributions produced for the three observations are shown in the right column of figure  3 , while the estimated uncertainties are included in table  1 .    to compute the pulsed fraction of the x - ray emission from",
    ", we used the _ chandra_observation .",
    "we extracted a total of 5506 counts in the @xmath27 kev band from the on - pulsar pixels of the count distribution ( the solid curve in figure  2 ) . after subtracting the local nebular contribution estimated from the neighboring off - pulsar pixels ,",
    "the remaining 3560@xmath2892 counts are considered as the net total emission from the pulsar .",
    "this emission can be further divided into the pulsed and persistent components . to determine the persistent component",
    ", we construct a distribution of the persistent emission from the off - pulse counts , defined to be in the phase interval @xmath29 ( figure  5 ) .",
    "the same on - pulsar pixels as shown in figure  2 now contain a total of 598 counts , corrected for the off - pulse phase fraction ( 1/5 ) , the total number of persistent counts over the entire phase is then 598@xmath305 .",
    "therefore , the net number of the pulsed counts is ( 5506 - 598@xmath305)=2516@xmath28143 .",
    "this results in a pulsed fraction of @xmath31 .",

    "the pulsar counts ( pulsed and unpulsed ) are extracted from the 6 pixel source region as discussed in  2 and the background from the neighboring 4 pixels .",
    "the calculated @xmath37 is shown in the lower panel of figure  5 .",
    "fitting these @xmath37 data points assuming a constant @xmath37 value resulted in a @xmath24 of 17.94 for 9 degrees of freedom , which means that the hardness ratio changes with phase at a confidence level of 96.4@xmath38 .",
    "further more , it appears that the @xmath37 values of the on pulse emission are higher than those of the off - pulse emission . in order to quantify this , we computed the mean @xmath37 for the off - pulse emission ( bins 1 , 2 3 and 10 in the panel ) as @xmath39 and the on - pulse bins ( 4 to 9 ) as @xmath40 . therefore , the on - pulse emission is harder than the off - pulse emission at a confidence level of @xmath41 , or 98@xmath38 .",
    "next , we study the _",
    "chandra _",
    "spectrum of psr j1930 + 1852 using the same sources and background counts as extracted above . for the pulsed spectrum ,",
    "the phase width corrected off - pulse counts are subtracted from the on - pulse counts in each spectral bin .",
    "figure  6a presents the best fit absorbed power - law model using the standard response matrix .",
    "although the overall @xmath24 is acceptable ( 34.4 for 35 degree - of - freedom ) , the residuals to this fit display characteristic feature , indicating that the gain of the response function is not properly calibrated for the cc - mode . following the method suggested by kaaret et al .",
    "( 2001 ) we calibrate the gain offset and scale in _ xspec _ by comparing the overall cc - mode spectra of  to that determined by the acis - s3 imaging data .",
    "the latter is characterized by the same model with the absorption column density @xmath42 @xmath7 and a photon index @xmath43 ( camilo et al .",
    "the resulting gain scale and offset are found to be 0.90 and -0.18 , respectively . fixing this gain correction and @xmath44 to the above values",
    ", we re - fit the pulsed emission spectrum to obtain a photon index of @xmath45 ( see figure  6b ) .",
    "the new @xmath24 value is 17.7 for 34 degree - of - freedom , significantly better than without the gain correction .",
    "the pulsed flux measured in the @xmath5  kev energy band is @xmath46 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath1 . when compared to the overall @xmath5  kev flux of @xmath47 ergs @xmath7 s@xmath1 ( camilo et al .",
    "2002 ) , this implies that @xmath3 of the total emission from the pulsar is pulsed , consistent with the estimate in section 3.1 .",
    "the properties of  are most similar to those found for other examples of young , energetic pulsars .",
    "the power - law spectral index of the pulsar emission is consistent with its spin - down energy according to the empirical law of gotthelf ( 2003 ) for energetic rotation powered pulsars with @xmath48  erg  s@xmath1 .",
    "the power law index is also consistent with that of the pulsed emission , as found for other high @xmath49 , crab - like pulsars ( gotthelf 2003 ) . as with most x - ray detected radio pulsars",
    ", the x - ray pulse morphology differs from that of the radio pulse .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the x - ray pulse is 0.4 phase compared to 0.15 phase in radio .",
    "notably , the x - ray pulse has a steep rise and slow decline , whereas the radio pulse is inverted , with a slow rise and steep decay instead .",
    "the unpulsed component of  is most likely nonthermal in nature as the thermal emission from the cooling surface of the neutron star should be negligible .",
    "according to the standard theoretical cooling curves , the surface temperature of a 1.4 m@xmath50 neutron star is about 0.13 kev at the age of  ( about 3,000 years ; page 1998 ) . assuming a radius of 12 km the neutron star should have an absorbed @xmath51 kev flux of @xmath52  erg  @xmath7  s@xmath1 , which accounts for @xmath53 0.4% of our detected total @xmath51  kev x - ray flux or 1.4% of the unpulsed flux .",
    "tennant et al . ( 2001 ) detected the x - ray emission of the crab pulsar at its pulse minimum , though accounting for only a tiny fraction of the total or unpulsed flux .",
    "tennant et al . ( 2001 ) further suggested that this component is nonthermal .",
    "the unpulsed x - ray emission from  may be of the same nature as that of the crab pulsar .    together with the previous x - ray and radio periods ,",
    "the three timing measurements obtained herein provide an opportunity to study the pulsar period evolution .",
    "a linear fit to these periods yields a @xmath54 of 7.5116(6)@xmath55  s  s@xmath1 with a reduced @xmath56 of 3.6 ( see figure  7 ) . the large @xmath56 value and",
    "the scattered residuals show that the period of  evolves in a more complicated than a simply constant spin down .",
    "the period derivative obtained here is also significantly ( @xmath57 ) different from that obtained by camilo et al .",
    "this suggests that  has experienced periods of timing noise and/or glitches - not unepxected for a young pulsar ( e.g. , zhang et al .",
    "2001 ; wang , et al . 2001 ; crawford & demiasky 2003 ) .",
    "arzoumanian et al . (",
    "1994 ) defined a quantity @xmath58 to represent the stability of a pulsar .",
    "they found an empirical relation between @xmath58 and @xmath54 , which predicts a high @xmath58 of -0.67 for psr j1930 + 1852 . this value is higher than those measured for most ordinary pulsars and",
    "is consistent with the variability in spin - down rate observed for this pulsar .    indeed ,  shares other interesting properties with psr  b0540 - 69 .",
    "for example , the pulsed x - ray emission of psr  b0540 - 69 has probably a harder spectrum , with a photon index of @xmath59 , than the steady component whose photon index is ( @xmath60 ; kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ) , whereas also has a harder pulsed emission than the steady emission .",
    "furthermore , the pulse width of psr  b0540 - 69 is about 0.4 and its pulsed fraction @xmath61 , both nearly identical to the respective values measured herein for .",
    "based on these x - ray emission similarities , the x - ray emission regions of the two pulsars may have the similar overall structures and viewing geometries .",
