    "with the successful launch of the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , we now have an unprecedented opportunity to study in detail the @xmath0-ray emission from different types of astrophysical sources .",
    "the 2fgl catalog @xcite contains 1873 sources detected in the 100mev to 100gev range by the large area telescope ( lat ) onboard the _ fermi _ satellite during the first 24 months of the science phase of the mission , which began on 2008 august 4 . among 1297 objects included in 2fgl which are firmly identified or reliably associated with counterparts of known source classes ,",
    "more than half are blazars , i.e. active galactic nuclei ( agn ) with radiative outputs dominated by a beamed jet emission .",
    "non - blazar agn constitute only a small fraction ( @xmath6 ) of the identified 2fgl population , but nonetheless have already emerged as a new , important , and at the same time relatively diverse class of @xmath0-ray emitters .",
    "the second catalog of agn detected by ( 2lac ; * ? ? ? * ) contains ten radio galaxies , four narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies , and several other non - blazar - type agn with prominent starburst components ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "particularly noteworthy in this context is the detection of the giant lobes in the nearby radio galaxy centaurusa , extending for about @xmath7 in the east - west direction , and @xmath8 in the north - south direction ( @xmath9kpc@xmath10kpc at the distance of @xmath11mpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results regarding the centaurusa lobes have profound implications for the general understanding of the evolution of radio galaxies , their interactions with the surrounding environment , and the production of high - energy particles in the universe .",
    "in particular , prompted by these recent results from the and also from the pierre auger observatory @xcite , several authors have debated on the high - energy particle acceleration and production of ultra high - energy cosmic rays within the giant lobes of centaurusa and similar systems @xcite .",
    "besides centaurusa , three other radio galaxies detected so far with could be promising targets for investigating the extended @xmath0-ray emission components associated with radio lobes . prior to the launch of _ fermi",
    "_ , @xcite and @xcite pointed out that the radio lobes of fornaxa might be detected at gev energies and seen as extended structures by the lat but its associated 2fgl source is faint and currently appears to be a point - source @xcite .",
    "similarly , the @xmath0-ray emission associated with centaurusb and reported recently in 2lac may be dominated by the lobes , but due to a relatively small angular size of the source ( @xmath12 in the north - south direction ) careful analysis of the data is needed before drawing any robust conclusions ( katsuta et al . in prep ) .",
    "the giant radio galaxy ngc6251 already appeared in the first - year catalog ( 1fgl ; * ? ? ? * ) and is another object worth attention due to the large angular extent of its radio structure ( @xmath13 ) which in principle could be resolved with above 1gev photon energies .",
    "based on the one - year of accumulated lat data , the ngc6251 nucleus was included within the 95@xmath14 lat error ellipse of 1fglj1635.4 + 8228 , and its reported @xmath0-ray flux could be due to the unresolved nuclear jet of the radio galaxy @xcite . subsequently however , the position of the 2fgl counterpart of ngc6251 , namely 2fglj1629.4 + 8236 ( detected at @xmath15 level ) , is now shifted north - west with respect to the 1fgl source position , toward the outer jet and radio lobe .",
    "we note that previously , the ngc6251 galaxy was proposed to be associated with the egret source 3egj1621 + 8203 @xcite .",
    "ngc6251 is a nearby agn hosting a supermassive black hole with a mass , @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it is classified as an fri radio galaxy @xcite based on its jet morphology and monochromatic 178mhz luminosity of @xmath17whz@xmath5sr@xmath5 @xcite , although the entire giant radio structure resembles more frii or intermediate fri / frii systems @xcite . at the distance of @xmath18mpc ( @xmath19 , conversion scale @xmath20kpc / arcsec ;",
    "* ) the linear extension of the lobes reads as @xmath21mpc , which is a larger physical size than that covered by the outer lobes of centaurusa .",
    "the radio jet in ngc6251 , discussed in detail in @xcite , is likely to be relativistic up to large distances from the core and observed at viewing angles @xmath22deg , as suggested by the jet - to - counterjet brightness asymmetry on both pc and kpc scales .",
    "it can be divided into ( i ) the bright inner region within the first @xmath23 , ( ii ) a faint central part extending from @xmath23 up to @xmath24 , ( iii ) the _ outer region _ flaring between @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and ( iv ) a curved and low - surface brightness tail beyond @xmath25 . the outer jet region has been detected at x - ray frequencies by _ rosat _",
    "@xcite , xmm-_newton _ and _ chandra _ @xcite .",
    "the origin of the detected jet x - ray emission is still an open question and different models have been discussed for such , including thermal emission @xcite , beamed inverse - compton radiation @xcite , and synchrotron process @xcite .",
    "however , none of the previous x - ray observations pointed to either the north - west or south - east lobe regions , separated by @xmath26 and @xmath27 from the ngc6251 nucleus , respectively .    in this paper",
    ", we present the results of the newly conducted observations of ngc6251 with the x - ray satellite @xcite mainly in 2011 april .",
    "ngc6251 was first observed by in 2010 december @xcite , but these observations targeted strictly the nucleus of the radio galaxy .",
    "this time the pointing direction was intentionally shifted 15 arcmin in the north - west direction from the nucleus in order to study the @xmath0-ray emission peak discovered with around the position of the nw radio lobe . in  2 , we describe the observations and data reduction procedure .",
    "the results of the analysis are given in  3 .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are presented in  4 and  5 , respectively .",
    "is the ideal instrument for the intended study since it provides a low and stable non x - ray background ( nxb ) , particularly for diffuse sources @xcite .",
    "we have therefore observed the nw lobe in ngc6251 for 34.2ksec ( `` on '' pointing ) .",
    "in addition , two short observations ( 18.8ksec and 12.1ksec ) were made in the vicinity of the radio lobe in order to estimate the background flux ( `` off '' pointings ) .",
    "hereafter , we denote these three observations as lobe , bgd1 , and bgd2 , respectively , and the observation log is provided in table1 . both bgd1 and bgd2 observations were made just after the lobe observation so that the long - term background fluctuation as well as possible effects caused by the detector degradation can be minimized . in the case of bgd2 , an additional short ( 11.1ksec )",
    "exposure was obtained in 2011 august , but these data were excluded from the analysis presented here to avoid possible artifacts related to the aforementioned problems .",
    "we have checked that the presented results do not change within statistical errors when the additional bgd2 data are included in the spectral analysis .",
    "the observations were made with x - ray imaging spectrometer ( xis ; * ? ? ? * ) which consists of four ccd cameras each placed in the focal plane of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and with the hard x - ray detector ( hxd ; * ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "each xis covers a @xmath28 region on the sky , which is sufficiently large to include the whole nw lobe within a single pointing image . on the other hand ,",
    "since hxd is a non - imaging instrument with a large field of view @xmath29 @xcite and we can not discriminate between the hard x - ray emission from the nucleus @xcite and possible emission from the extended nw radio lobe in the hxd data , we only use the imaging and spectral results obtained with xis in this paper .",
    "one of the xis sensors ( xis 1 ) has a back - illuminated ( bi ) ccd , while the other three ( xiss 0 , 2 , and 3 ) utilize front - illuminated ( fi ) ccds .",
    "because of an anomaly in 2006 november , the operation of xis2 has been terminated and we use only three ccds .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal full - frame clocking mode with the @xmath30 or @xmath31 editing mode .    in our pointing ,",
    "the relatively bright ngc6251 nucleus was located well outside the field of view of the xis .",
    "however , due to the relatively large point spread function of the xrt onboard ( half power diameter of @xmath32 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the contamination of the ngc6251 nucleus may still , in principle , affect the exposure of the nw radio lobe : the pointing center of our lobe observation is separated by only @xmath33 from the core .",
    "for this reason , we simulated the contamination effect using ` xissim ` . in the simulation",
    ", we assumed a point source at the position of the nucleus characterized by a power - law continuum with the photon index , @xmath34 , and the normalization @xmath35photonskev@xmath5@xmath4s@xmath5 at 1kev ( corresponding to the @xmath36kev unabsorbed luminosity @xmath37ergs@xmath5 ) , as reported in @xcite .",
    "we found that the expected net count rate ( the xis count rate for the `` on '' pointing subtracted by the background count rate estimated from the `` off '' pointings ) for the region used in the spectral analysis ( see  3.2 below ) due to the core contamination is @xmath38s@xmath5 only , whilst the total source net count rate is @xmath39s@xmath5 .",
    "hence , we conclude that the leakage effect is at the level of about @xmath40 , and so that the stray light contamination from the ngc6251 nucleus can be considered as negligible when analyzing the diffuse emission of the nw lobe .",
    "we analyzed the screened xis data , reduced using the software version 1.2 .",
    "the screening was based on the following criteria : ( 1 ) only _",
    "asca_-grade 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 events were accumulated , while hot and flickering pixels were removed from the xis image using the ` sisclean ` script @xcite , ( 2 ) the time interval after the passage of south atlantic anomaly was greater than 60s , ( 3 ) the object was at least @xmath41 and @xmath42 above the rim of the earth ( elv ) during night and day , respectively .",
    "in addition , we also selected the data with a cutoff rigidity ( cor ) larger than 6gv .",
    "in the reduction and the analysis of the xis data , headas software version 6.11 and a calibration databases ( caldb ) released on 2009 september 25 were used .",
    "the xis cleaned event data - set was obtained in the combined @xmath30 and @xmath31 edit modes using ` xselect ` .",
    "we note that no spectral variability were observed in the xis data and the imaging and spectral analyses are discussed in the next section .",
    "we extracted the xis images within the photon energy range of @xmath43kev from only the two fi ccds ( xis 0 , xis 3 ) because the bi ccd ( xis1 ) has lower imaging quality . in the image analysis , we excluded calibration sources at the corner of the ccd chips .",
    "the images of the nxb were obtained from the night earth data using ` xisnxbgen ` @xcite . since the exposure times for the original data were different from that of nxb , we calculated the appropriate exposure - corrected original and nxb maps using ` xisexpmapgen ` @xcite .",
    "the corrected nxb images were next subtracted from the corrected original images .",
    "in addition , we simulated flat sky images using ` xissim ` @xcite , and applied a vignetting correction .",
    "all the images obtained with xis0 and xis3 were combined and rebinned by a factor of 4 ( ccd pixel size @xmath44@xmath45m@xmath46@xmath45 m , so that @xmath47 pixels cover an @xmath28 region on the sky ; * ? ? ? * ) . throughout these processes",
    ", we also performed vignetting correction for all the xis images for lobe , bgd1 and bgd2 .",
    "finally , the images were smoothed with a gaussian function with @xmath48 .",
    "the resulting xis images are shown in figure1 , with a 325mhz radio contours of ngc6251 @xcite and the 95@xmath14 lat error circle of 2fglj1629.4 + 8236 overlaid .",
    "when comparing the lobe , bgd1 , and bgd2 images , one can clearly see an excess x - ray emission possibly associated with the nw radio lobe .",
    "the apparent enhancements at the edges of the xis images are artifacts due to an insufficient exposure at the ccd edges caused by small fluctuation of attitude during the observation .",
    "interestingly , at the sensitivity limit of these observations , no excess x - ray emission was detected from the bright radio hotspot located at the edge of the lobe . in the context of the study by @xcite , since ngc6251 is a low power fri / ii source , the x - ray emission from the hotspot is expected to be dominated by the high energy energy tail of the synchrotron continuum rather than by the inverse - compton component .",
    "specifically , the radio flux of the hotspot of 0.1jy at 1.5ghz allows us to estimate roughly the expected x - ray flux by extrapolating the observed hotspot spectrum from lower frequencies as @xmath49 njy .",
    "a point source at this flux level is easily detectable by _ chandra _ or _ xmm _ , but our non - detection is unsurprising due to the relatively poor angular resolution of the instrument combined with a relatively intense diffuse emission of the surrounding lobe .      in the spectral analysis , we extracted photons from the arc - like source region in the lobe pointing as shown in figure2 .",
    "this ` arc - like region ' we are referring to is a part of a concentric ring centered at the radio core position of ngc6251 .",
    "there we excluded x - ray point sources detected by _ rosat _",
    "( see the table1 described in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as background contaminants , assuming the source region radii @xmath50 ( a typical half - power diameter of the xrt , as described above ) .",
    "we note that the origin of these x - ray features is still under debate , and hence it remains possible that they represent hotspot and enhancement related to the nw lobe itself . in our analysis , however , we removed all such bright x - ray spots , since the main objective of the paper is to detect and to characterize the _ diffuse _ x - ray emission component associated with the _ diffuse _ radio structure of the lobe .",
    "similarly , we defined arc - like background regions for both bgd1 and bgd2 pointing using the same detector coordinates as chosen for the lobe source region .",
    "we extracted the spectra from lobe , bgd1 and bgd2 source regions with ` xselect ` for each ccd ( xis 0 , xis 1 , xis 3 ) .",
    "spectral analysis and model fitting were performed with ` xspec ` version 12.7.0 . in order to improve the statistics",
    ", the spectra of xis0 and xis3 were summed together using ` mathpha ` .",
    "moreover , the spectra of bgd1 and bgd2 were summed for the same reason in the same way . finally , we made redistribution matrix files ( rmfs ) and ancillary response files ( arfs ) using ` xisrmfgen ` and ` xissimarfgen ` @xcite , respectively .    using these rmfs and arfs",
    ", the corrected spectrum about energy response and the effective area of xis were obtained .",
    "figure3 shows the resulting ( background subtracted ) spectrum of the lobe pointing within the energy range @xmath51kev .",
    "the spectrum could be well fitted by a single power - law continuum with a photon index , @xmath1 , moderated by the galactic absorption only .",
    "the galactic hydrogen column density was fixed as @xmath52@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath53/d.o.f@xmath54 indicates that this is a satisfactory model for the diffuse x - ray emission component of the nw lobe in ngc6251 .",
    "the details of the fitting results are summarized in table2 .",
    "we note that , the spectrum is also equally well reproduced by a thin thermal plasma models ( either bremsstrahlung and/or raymond - smith ) moderated by galactic absorption , with the temperature of @xmath55 @xmath56 3.7 kev .",
    "this is rather high compared with those of thermal plasma of nearby elliptical galaxies ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the implied thermal pressure , @xmath57 @xmath58 2@xmath5910@xmath60 dyn @xmath4 , is more than four orders of magnitude larger than the minimum - energy non - thermal pressure of the lobes ( see , section 4.2 ) .",
    "we regard these parameters as unrealistic , and hence we conclude that the diffuse x - ray emission component detected at the position of the nw lobe is purely non - thermal in origin .",
    "the analysis of data for the nw lobe in ngc6251 revealed the presence of x - ray emission , most likely of diffuse nature , well fitted by a power - law continuum with photon index @xmath61 moderated by the galactic absorption only .",
    "the @xmath51kev luminosity of the lobe corresponding to the source extraction region reads as @xmath62ergs@xmath5 .",
    "the detection of such a non - thermal x - ray emission component is interesting , but not exceptional , since several analogous detections of the x - ray lobes in either fri or frii radio galaxies have been previously reported ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the relevance of our observations of the nw lobe in ngc6251 is due to the aforementioned possible ( or even likely ) association of the lobe with the source 2fglj1629.4 + 8326 .",
    "note that in the case of the only radio galaxy for which the lobe emission was robustly associated with a @xmath0-ray source so far , centaurusa , no diffuse x - ray emission component related to the extended radio structure has been detected ( see in this context , * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , our observations may potentially provide the very first case of the detected x - ray emission from the large - scale lobe bright in @xmath0-rays .    yet",
    "the above statement may be considered as premature , since the 95@xmath14 lat error circle of 2fglj1629.4 + 8236 includes not only the extended lobe but also the bright ` outer jet ' region ( see  1 and figure1 ) .",
    "this region , as mentioned previously , has been resolved in x - rays before with _",
    "rosat _ , _ chandra _ , and xmm-_newton _ @xcite .",
    "regardless of the debated origin of the jet - related x - ray photons ( synchrotron versus beamed inverse - compton ) , large scale jets detected at kev photon energies are in general thought to be the sites of efficient acceleration of high - energy electrons , and as such , to be potential sources of @xmath0-rays detectable by modern instruments like ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "below we discuss in more detail the possible association of 2fglj1629.4 + 8236 with the outer jet and with the nw lobe of ngc6251 , and demonstrate by means of broad - band spectral modeling that the @xmath0-ray flux can best be accounted for by the high - energy tail of the inverse - compton continuum of the lobe .      for the spectral modeling of the outer jet region ,",
    "we take the 1.4ghz flux density , @xmath63jy measured by @xcite from a vla map , and assume the radio spectral index @xmath64 within the @xmath65ghz range @xcite .",
    "we also approximate the x - ray spectrum of this region as a power - law with the photon index @xmath66 within the @xmath67kev range and the monochromatic flux @xmath68njy , as given in @xcite.njy and @xmath69 within the @xmath70kev range .",
    "our re - analysis of archival xmm-_newton _ data is however more consistent with that of @xcite . ]",
    "we approximate the jet as a cylinder with a radius @xmath71kpc and _ projected _ length @xmath72kpc so that the emitting volume is @xmath73 .",
    "we model the broad - band emission of the outer jet region in the framework of the beamed inverse - compton scenario @xcite , with the radio emission being due to the synchrotron radiation of non - thermal electrons distributed isotropically within a relativistic outflow , and the x - ray ",
    "to@xmath0-ray continuum due to comptonization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons by the same electron population ( ` beamed ec / cmb ' model below ) .",
    "anisotropy of the cmb radiation in the jet rest frame , as well as klein - nishina effects , are properly taken into account @xcite .",
    "for simplicity , we assume homogeneous distributions of the radiating electrons and of the magnetic field within the whole outer jet region , which should be considered as a rough approximation only considering the observed asymmetric radio intensity and polarization transverse profiles of the outer jet @xcite .    as shown in figure4 ( thin solid line )",
    ", the @xmath0-ray flux of 2fglj1629.4 + 8236 is not well accounted for by the beamed ec / cmb model for the jet with the following ` best fit ' parameters : the ratio between comoving electron and magnetic field energy densities @xmath74 , magnetic field intensity @xmath75@xmath45 g , jet bulk lorentz factor @xmath76 , jet viewing angle @xmath77deg , and the electron energy distribution of a power - law form @xmath78 $ ] with @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 . with the above model parameters the observed ratio of the inverse - compton and synchrotron peak luminosities reads as @xmath82",
    "note however that the relatively small jet viewing angle implied by the model , @xmath77deg , may be considered as unlikely considering the large _ projected _ size of the whole radio structure of ngc6251 ( see the related discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "on the other hand , the implied jet kinetic luminosities stored in electrons , magnetic field , and cold protons ( assuming equal comoving number densities of protons and electrons ) , namely @xmath83ergs@xmath5 , @xmath84ergs@xmath5 , and @xmath85ergs@xmath5 , giving the total jet power @xmath86ergs@xmath5 , could be considered as reasonable values @xcite .",
    "this may imply that if the beamed ec / cmb model for the large - scale jet in ngc6251 with the parameters as given above is realistic at all , the outer parts of the outflow may provide some contribution to the observed @xmath0-ray flux of 2fglj1629.4 + 8236 , at least at the highest photon energies within the lat range .",
    "next we consider the case of the nw lobe of ngc6251 likely associated with the source 2fglj1629.4 + 8236 .",
    "for the purpose of the spectral modeling we measured radio fluxes for the lobe from published _ wsrt _ maps at 327 and 610 mhz @xcite .",
    "additionally , we obtained a new vla 1.56 ghz map at 45@xmath87 resolution with a total 5 hr integration from combining archival d - array observations obtained on 1985 december 1 , 5 , and 1986 jan 18 ( programs ab346 and test ) .",
    "our measurements , @xmath88jy , @xmath89jy , and @xmath90jy , all assuming @xmath91 errors , were measured using the same source extraction regions as in the analysis ( see figure2 ) .",

    "note that the emerging radio spectral index @xmath94 is roughly consistent with the x - ray spectral index of the lobe measured by .",
    "the lobe is approximated as a sphere with the radius @xmath95kpc , so that the emission region volume is @xmath96 .    for the lobe , we use a similar model as for the outer jet region discussed above , but include in addition extragalactic background light ( ebl ) photons within the infrared  to  optical range as target photon field for the inverse - compton scattering ( ` ec/(cmb+ebl ) ' model ) . in the calculations we use the ebl model of @xcite and",
    "account for klein - nishina effects .",

    "+ 8236 can be accounted for reasonably well ( see figure4 , thick gray line ) by the inverse - compton emission of the lobe for the following parameters : the equipartition ratio @xmath98 , magnetic field intensity @xmath99@xmath45 g , and the electron energy distribution of a double - broken power - law form @xmath100 for @xmath101 and @xmath102 $ ] for @xmath103 with @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , and @xmath108 . with the above model parameters , the lobe pressure stored in ultrarelativistic electrons and magnetic field is @xmath109dyn@xmath4 .",

    "such an extrapolation may not provide a realistic estimate however , and should rather be considered as an upper limit for the ambient medium pressure .",
    "this , together with a likely contribution of ( mildly ) relativistic protons to the lobe s internal pressure , may suggest that either the extended radio structures in ngc6251 are in a pressure equilibrium with the environment , or that these are over - pressured cavities , so that the expansion of the giant lobes in the system is still pressure - driven on mpc scale ( basically beyond the extension of the thermal halo of the surrounding group of galaxies ) .",
    "we have presented a x - ray observation of the nw lobe in a nearby radio galaxy ngc6251 . through this observation , we found for the first time non - thermal diffuse x - ray emission associated with the nw lobe .",
    "since the error circle of the @xmath0-ray source 2fgl  j1629.4 + 8236 contains @xmath130 the nw lobe and outer jet region , we discussed the possible origin of @xmath0-ray emission by detailed modeling of the spectral energy distributions assuming a synchrotron plus inverse - compton emission on cmb background photons .",
    "we argued that , at least at energies below 10 gev , the observed @xmath0-ray emission is well explained by non - thermal emission from the nw lobe rather than from the outer jet region , with reasonable physical parameters ( such as magnetic field , electron density etc ) expected in radio lobes in general . since the spatial extent of the ngc  6251 radio lobe is quite large ( @xmath58 0.5 mpc ) , and the expected radiative cooling time is much shorter for @xmath0-ray emitting electrons , efficient in - situ acceleration of radiative particles is necessary within the whole volume of the giant lobe .",
    "we also briefly discussed the non - thermal pressure stored in ultrarelativistic electrons and magnetic field ( not considering a likely contribution of relativistic proton ) of the nw lobe in ngc6251 , which is estimated as @xmath127dyn@xmath4 from the model , and it seems comparable with or somewhat less than the thermal pressure of the surrounding gaseous medium .",

    "<S> we report the results of a x - ray imaging study of ngc6251 , a nearby giant radio galaxy with intermediate fri / ii radio properties . </S>",
    "<S> our pointing direction was centered on the @xmath0-ray emission peak recently discovered with around the position of the north - west radio lobe 15 arcmin offset from the nucleus . after subtracting two `` off - source '' pointings adjacent to the radio lobe , and removing possible contaminants in the xis field of view , we found significant residual x - ray emission most likely diffuse in nature . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the excess x - ray emission is well fit by a power law with photon index @xmath1 and a @xmath2kev flux of @xmath3erg@xmath4s@xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this diffuse x - ray emission component as being due to inverse - compton up - scattering of the cosmic microwave background photons by ultrarelativistic electrons within the lobe , with only a minor contribution from the beamed emission of the large - scale jet . </S>",
    "<S> utilizing archival radio data for the source , we demonstrate by means of broad - band spectral modeling that the @xmath0-ray flux of the source 2fglj1629.4 + 8236 may well be accounted for by the high - energy tail of the inverse - compton continuum of the lobe . </S>",
    "<S> thus , this claimed association of @xmath0-rays from the north - west lobe of ngc6251 , together with the recent imaging of the extended lobes of centaurusa , indicates that particles may be efficiently ( re-)accelerated up to ultrarelativistic energies within extended radio lobes of nearby radio galaxies in general . </S>"
