    "_ einstein _ imaging observations were the first to reveal that the x - ray emission of a subset of spiral galaxies is dominated by one or more very luminous ( l@xmath1 erg s@xmath2 ) discrete x - ray sources located outside the nucleus of the galaxy ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "_ rosat _ and _ asca _ observations have since confirmed the presence of many of these `` ultraluminous x - ray sources '' ( ulx ) erg s@xmath2 extra - nuclear x - ray sources as `` ultraluminous x - ray sources '' throughout this proposal .",
    "this class of object is alternatively referred to as `` super - luminous x - ray sources '' ( sls ) , `` super - eddington x - ray sources '' ( ses ) or `` intermediate - luminosity x - ray objects '' ( ixos ) in the literature .",
    "] in nearby galaxies . a first indication of the statistical incidence of ulx in the nearby universe came from the _ rosat _ hri survey of bright , nearby galaxies ( @xcite ) where we catalogued 28 sources with l@xmath3 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) in the outer regions of a sample of 83 galaxies , with only one in five of the galaxies surveyed hosting one or more ulx .",
    "this clearly underlines the rarity of this source class .",
    "given the high luminosities of this class of objects , which appear intermediate between classic x - ray binaries ( l@xmath4 erg s@xmath2 ) and active galactic nuclei ( l@xmath5 erg s@xmath2 ) , and their extra - nuclear locations , their physical nature is far from obvious .",
    "determining this nature is therefore a compelling challenge . in this paper",
    "we review the progress made towards this end through recent _ rosat _ , _ asca _ and _ chandra _ studies , and present new _ chandra _ observations including an x - ray / optical study of two bright ulx , and an observation of the ulx - rich galaxy pair ngc 4485/90 .",
    "we conclude with a summary of how recent results are advancing our understanding of the nature of ulx in nearby galaxies .",
    "a reasonable assumption to make is that ulx are powered by accretion .",
    "if we then consider a ulx emitting isotropically in the x - ray regime with a luminosity of @xmath6 erg s@xmath2 , a simple eddington luminosity limit argument implies that the mass of the compact accreting object is at least 25 @xmath7 .",
    "if the accretion is occuring at lower rates , this implies that the compact object mass is even higher , potentially placing it anywhere in the @xmath8 regime ( dependent upon the accretion rate ) .",
    "this is at odds with previous theoretical and observational studies of black holes which have found evidence for two main types , the remnants of massive stars ( with @xmath9 ) , and the `` super - massive '' black holes residing in the nuclei of galaxies ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "it is very unlikely that ulx contain the latter super - massive flavour , as these object would sink to the centre of the host galaxy through the action of dynamical friction in less than a hubble time ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , and the eddington limit argument rules out the stellar remnant black holes as insufficiently massive . it has therefore been suggested that ulx may represent a hitherto unrecognised @xmath11 _ intermediate - mass _ class of black holes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the evidence that a large fraction of ulx may indeed be powered by accretion onto a black hole is compelling .",
    "variability studies of ulx are very informative ; both _ rosat _ and _ asca _ studies have detected short - term variations ( @xmath12s of seconds ) consistent with accretion processes in the lightcurves of ulx ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "asca _ studies have observed long - term spectral transitions between soft / high and hard/ low states , very similar to the state changes observed in galactic black hole binaries ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the first suggestion of x - ray periodicity were recently discovered in a deep _ asca _ observation of a ulx in ic 342 , indicative of it residing in a stellar binary system ( @xmath13 hours , @xcite ) .",
    "_ asca _ spectroscopy has also provided important evidence towards a black hole interpretation for ulx , with the spectra of many examples being well - fit by the `` multi - colour disc black - body '' ( mcdbb ) emission model characteristic of an optically thick accretion disc around a black hole ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "intriguingly , this spectrum is also found to provide a good spectral fit to several galactic microquasars . however , the ulx spectral fits are problematic , as the derived inner - disc temperatures are too high for the massive black holes expected in these systems .",
    "@xcite explain this by inferring the presence of a rapidly - rotating kerr black hole , which allows the inner - edge of the accretion disc to move closer to the black hole and thus heat up .",
    "an alternate scenario that predicts the high temperatures observed in ulx , whilst retaining an intermediate - mass black hole , is the `` slim disc '' accretion regime ( @xcite ) . in this scenario near eddington - rate accretion",
    "is occuring and the x - ray emission is dominated by a compact region located very close to ( within three schwarzschild radii of ) the black hole , which is not required to be rotating .",
    "however , none of the _ asca _ data make an overwhelming case for the presence of a @xmath11 black hole .",
    "this is in a large part due to the uncertainty introduced by the source confusion inherent in the @xmath14 spatial resolution of _ asca _ , which may lead to overestimates of the source luminosities .",
    "the best evidence for intermediate - mass black holes comes from recent high spatial resolution _",
    "_ observations . the starburst galaxies m82 and ngc 3628 are both observed to host a near - nuclear , point - like ulx which is seen to be highly variable in observations spanning periods of several years , and display a peak luminosity of well over @xmath15 erg s@xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this implies black holes with masses in excess of several hundred @xmath7 in each ulx .",
    "recent results have , however , called into question the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole in many ulx .",
    "_ chandra _ observations have revealed that large numbers of ulx are present in very active starburst galaxies with , for example , about ten found in each of the antennae and ngc 3256 systems ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "other ulx , such as those in m82 and ngc 3628 mentioned above , also appear in star forming regions .",
    "* this implies that a large proportion of the ulx population is intrinsically linked to active star formation .",
    "* this may be inconsistent with the presence of an intermediate - mass black hole , with the strongest objection being that most formation scenarios , such as their creation from the hierarchal merging of black holes in the centre of a globular cluster , require considerably longer than the @xmath16 year lifetime of a starburst event .",
    "also , this model would locate the sources very close to the nucleus of the galaxy where the potential well is deep enough to retain the stellar mass black holes within the cluster ( see @xcite and references therein for further discussion ) .",
    "we must therefore consider alternative origins for the ulx phenomenon .",
    "one possibility is that a reasonable proportion of the ulx population is composed of recent supernovae , which are known to reach x - ray luminosities of up to @xmath17 erg s@xmath2 if they explode in dense environments ( e.g. sn 1988z , @xcite ) .",
    "of the 28 ulx catalogued by @xcite , 3  4 are indeed identifiable with recent supernovae .",
    "however , given the spectral and variability characteristics of ulx described above it is unlikely that a much larger fraction have this origin .",
    "instead , it may be that a large proportion of ulx are mildly - beamed x - ray binaries , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "crucially , if ulx emit anisotropically then this removes the necessity for an intermediate - mass black hole .",
    "it does however imply large numbers of ulx , as only a small fraction of a beamed population will direct their emission along our line of sight at any one time .",
    "this problem is solved if the beaming originates in `` ordinary '' black hole and/or neutron star intermediate- and high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "this scenario produces a viable solution to the problem of associating ulx with ongoing star formation , as the short lifetime of high - mass x - ray binaries is well matched to the lifetime of the starburst .",
    "hence this is a promising candidate for explaining the nature of a large proportion of ulx .",
    "@xcite also postulate that the ulx phase is associated with a short - lived but common epoch of thermal - timescale mass transfer , which is inevitable in intermediate- and high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "this in turn provides a potential physical link to the galactic microquasars .",
    "the possibility of this physical similarity is further discussed by @xcite , who conclude that ulx are likely to be microquasars located in nearby galaxies that are observed with their jet oriented into our line - of - sight ( a phenomenon that may also referred to as `` microblazars '' ; see @xcite ) .",
    "hence we now have a viable alternative to the intermediate - mass black hole scenario which may be tested observationally by looking for further similarities between the ulx and galactic microquasar phenomena .",
    "the ulx phenomenon is comparatively poorly studied , mainly as result of their moderate observable x - ray fluxes ( @xmath18 erg @xmath19 s@xmath2 for the limited number of ulx within 10 mpc ) and the small x - ray collecting areas of previous missions .",
    "ulx are also particularly poorly understood in a multi - wavelength context , with little or no evidence for discrete counterparts previously reported in the literature .",
    "however , the increased effective areas and better spectral and spatial resolution of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ now provide us with a first opportunity to study many of these objects in detail .",
    "for our study we adopted a two - pronged approach , obtaining _",
    "chandra _ x - ray data and william herschel telescope / integral optical data .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "acis - s data were obtained to provide the best indication of whether the ulx are truly point - like at the highest currently available x - ray spatial resolution , and to provide the subarcsecond astrometry critical to follow - up the x - ray sources with multi - wavelength studies .",
    "the data were obtained in two epochs , separated by several months , to provide an initial study of the x - ray characteristics of the ulx , and their gross variability .",
    "optical data were obtained with the `` integral '' integral field unit on the william herschel telescope , la palma .",
    "this provided 189 separate optical spectra covering a @xmath20 field of view , over which images can be reconstructed ( utilising the relative fibre positions ) in any narrow - band within the @xmath21    wavelength coverage of the observations . here , we detail the results of this study for two of the nearest and brightest ulx catalogued by @xcite .",
    "this ulx was first identified by @xcite , who inferred from _ rosat _ pspc data that it was likely to be a several hundred year old buried supernova remnant on the outskirts of ngc 4559 ( note that they catalogue it as ngc 4559 x-7 , but we use the nomenclature of @xcite ) .",
    "its position is shown in figure 1 , where it appears coincident with an anomalous group of hii regions on the outskirts of the galaxy ( see also @xcite , and below ) .",
    "its x - ray profile is entirely consistent with a point - like x - ray source , and it is very luminous ; the _ chandra _ acis - s data measure a luminosity of @xmath22 erg s@xmath2 in both observation epochs .",
    "there is no significant short - term x - ray variability observable in either epoch , though a long - term lightcurve based on _ rosat _ data and the current observations suggests a gradual ( though not linear ) reduction in the flux level over the last 10 years ( see figure 2 ) .",
    "the analysis of the x - ray spectra of the ulx proved problematic , with no simple models providing very good fits .",
    "however , the best fits were achieved with a simple powerlaw model , which showed the ulx spectrum to soften slightly as the flux increased between the two observation epochs ( from @xmath23 to 2.15 , with no corresponding change in absorption column , over six months ) .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that observed previously in other ulx , where the spectra appears softer in higher flux states , and is consistent with the interpretation of ngc 4559 x-1 as a black hole x - ray binary system .                 in figure 3",
    "we show the integral data for the region containing ngc 4559 x-1 .",
    "this is shown as a series of four continuum - subtracted emission - line images , in the [ sii ] , h@xmath24 , [ oiii ] and h@xmath25 bands respectively , and also red continuum ( 6000  6200  ) and blue continuum ( 5100  5200  ) bands for comparison .",
    "the data shows that there is no obvious optical counterpart to ngc 4559 x-1 .",
    "instead , the most interesting feature of the images is the location of ngc 4559 x-1 in the centre of an apparent cavity in a region of emission - line gas surrounding the ulx .",
    "this leads to an interesting question : is ngc 4559 x-1 responsible for the emission - line nebulae ? the nebulae have previously been identified as a series of hii regions ( @xcite ) , and hence assumed to be powered by young stars , which would of course fit conveniently into the emerging relationship of ulx with star formation .",
    "however , the position of the ulx in the centre of the nebulae may call this into question , as it suggests the ulx is somehow responsible for the nebulae .",
    "a study of the extent of the influence of ngc 4559 x-1 on the surrounding nebulae is beyond the scope of this paper , but it is interesting to note that while this system may possibly be another manifestation of the relationship between ulx and active star formation , this can not be established for certain until we distinguish to what degree the nebulae are energised by the ulx or the putative young stars .",
    "a further point is that it is not entirely clear from the data whether the morphology of the surrounding gas is ring - like or conical .",
    "if it is conical , and a result of irradiation by the ulx , then this clearly supports the model of ulx as beamed systems .",
    "this ulx was first detected in _",
    "einstein _ data ( @xcite ) , and has since been catalogued in several _ rosat _ surveys , but has never been well - studied to date .",
    "the _ chandra _",
    "acis - s data reveal ngc 5204 x-1 to lie @xmath26 away from the nucleus of its host galaxy , the magellanic - type galaxy ngc 5204 ( see figure 4 ) .",
    "it is also point - like at the resolution of _ chandra _ , and has a luminosity that varies in the range @xmath27 erg s@xmath2 between the two observations ( an interval of four months ) .",
    "again , we see no evidence of short - term variability in the data , but the long - term lightcurve shows evidence for strong variability over a baseline of 20 years ( figure 5 ) .",
    "the x - ray spectrum is again best - fit by a powerlaw continuum model in both epochs .",
    "the best fits show that as the flux drops to @xmath28 of its original value over the four months interval between observations , the spectral index of the powerlaw softens from @xmath29 to @xmath30 .",
    "this is counter to the behaviour shown by other ulx and black hole x - ray binaries in general .",
    "however , this unusual behaviour may constitute the best evidence yet linking ulx to microquasars , as an anomalous soft / low state is also observed by _ xmm - newton _ for the galactic microquasar grs 1758 - 258 ( @xcite ) .                         perhaps the most important discovery in this work",
    "was reported in @xcite , in which we revealed the detection of the first possible stellar optical counterpart to an ulx .",
    "this object is dominated by blue continuum emission , and so only appears in the continuum band images shown here in figure 6 , and is discussed below .",
    "ngc 5204 x-1 also appears to be located in the centre of a cavity evident in the continuum - subtracted emission - line images ( though we note that this is not as `` clean '' an environment as ngc 4559 x-1 , since ngc 5204 x-1 is located further within its galaxy where source confusion is a greater issue ) .",
    "this potential similarity to the environment of ngc 4559 x-1 raises the question of whether a large number of ulx are located in similar cavities , and implies that they may be a common feature of ulx .",
    "further results on this phenomenon , showing it may indeed be common to ulx , are presented by @xcite in these proceedings .",
    "in @xcite we discussed the nature of the optical counterpart , concluding from its featureless blue continuum optical spectrum that it was likely to be an o - star , or a small o - star association , in ngc 5204 ( since at @xmath31 we require at least 5 o supergiants to be present to account for the optical flux ) .",
    "however , we could not completely rule out the scenario in which the x - ray source and its optical counterpart are actually a bl lac object located behind the galaxy .",
    "this can now be ruled out .",
    "firstly , newly public _ hst _",
    "wfpc images covering the region around ngc 5204 x-1 resolve the previous counterpart into two separate , yet still point - like , optical sources at @xmath32 resolution , both of which remain blue in colour .",
    "the resolved sources are shown in figure 7 .",
    "the brighter of the sources has @xmath33 , and is still consistent with at least four o supergiants in ngc 5204 .",
    "secondly , new vla radio data has placed a stringent limit of 84 @xmath34jy on the 3.6 cm radio continuum emission at the position of ngc 5204 x-1 ( @xcite , these proceedings ) , which implies the radio flux is too low for the source to be identified as a bl lac .",
    "we are therefore now confident that we are observing a good candidate ulx and optical counterpart system in ngc 5204 .",
    "the o - star classification is wholly consistent with the relationship between ulx and star formation , and indeed is consistent with the @xcite scenario in which ulx are ordinary high - mass x - ray binaries with x - ray emission beamed into our line - of - sight .",
    "furthermore , the noted similarity between the soft / low state of ngc 5204 x-1 and that observed in the galactic microquasar grs 1758 - 258 may provide the some of the best evidence so far that ulx and microquasars are one and the same phenomenon .",
    "a further , perhaps more convenient , method of studying the x - ray properties of ulx is to observe several of them at once .",
    "this is only possible in a few galaxies in the local universe , which tend to be systems undergoing very active star - formation ( see section 2 ) .",
    "one such host is the tidally - interacting late - type galaxy pair ngc 4485/ngc 4490 which is located at a distance of only 7.8 mpc .",
    "it was observed to host three ulx in the _ rosat _ hri survey of @xcite . a 20 ks _",
    "acis - s gto was undertaken in november 2000 , the results of which are discussed in @xcite . here , we concentrate on the remarkable population of ulx unveiled by this observation .",
    "ellipse ) , with luminosities down to 3 @xmath35 10@xmath36 erg s@xmath2 , and are shown by the red circles .",
    "the circle sizes scale logarithmically with flux for each source.,width=340 ]        the _ chandra _ acis - s observation reveals a total of six ulx within ngc 4485/90 , ranging in observed luminosity between @xmath37 and @xmath38 erg s@xmath2 ( 0.5 - 8 kev ) . the positions of the ulx within the galaxies are shown in figure 8 .",
    "note that we see all three ulx reported in @xcite , and of the three new ulx two appear due to the hard ( @xmath39 kev ) response of the acis - s ( one of which was previously unknown , the other known but not luminous enough to be classified as an ulx ) .",
    "the third new ulx appears to be a truly transient source .",
    "an examination of the short - term variability data for each ulx shows that none are significantly variable over the duration of the _ chandra _ observation .",
    "however , the long - term lightcurves ( figure 9 ) show that significant variability characterises four of the six ulx over the 10-year observation baseline .",
    "three of the four sources detected at all five observation epochs are strongly variable ( a , d and e ) ; only source f shows little or no variability .",
    "source c is the transient , with _ rosat _ ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) flux upper limits below the observed _ chandra _ flux . only one ulx is too faint to have appeared in any previous observation , source b. an inspection of its spectral data shows this is because it is absorbed by a column of well in excess of @xmath40 atom @xmath19 .",
    "however , it actually has the softest intrinsic spectral form of the six ulx ( a thermal bremsstrahlung with @xmath41 kev ) .",
    "it is also exactly coincident with a first survey radio source , suggesting its identification as a recent supernova in ngc 4490 .",
    "the other five ulx all have intrinsically harder spectra , though are subject to less absorption column ( which varies between 2 and @xmath42 atom @xmath19 over the five sources ) . the two brightest ulx ( a and f ) are best fit by the mcdbb model favoured in many _ asca _ spectral fits of ulx .",
    "the other three ulx , for which the spectral data are of a lower quality , are all equally well - fit by either an mcdbb or a powerlaw continuum model .",
    "however , the best - fit values given by the mcdbb model all have values of @xmath43 in the @xmath44 kev range found in _ asca",
    "_ spectroscopy .",
    "it appears , therefore , that on the basis of their spectral and temporal characteristics the five ulx without radio counterparts are all consistent with black - hole x - ray binaries .",
    "the presence of six ulx in a small galaxy pair is quite remarkable , as the non - nuclear x - ray source luminosity distribution of @xcite predicts that we should only observe @xmath45 ulx in the ngc 4485/90 system , based on the combined @xmath46 of ngc 4485/90 .",
    "however , this system shows considerable evidence for enhanced star formation in both radio and far infra - red observations , with a star formation rate of @xmath47 per year ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ongoing star formation is mainly located in the tidal arms and bridge between the galaxies , with further peaks of activity slightly to the west of the nucleus of ngc 4490 and in a northern spiral arm .",
    "the six ulx are all present within these regions , with source a located in the tidal tail of ngc 4485 , sources b , c and d in the western ( tidally disrupted ) spiral arm of ngc 4490 , source e in the near - nuclear star forming region and source f in the northern spiral arm ( c.f .",
    "figure 8) .",
    "* this direct spatial co - location of the ulx and the star formation regions in ngc 4485/90 is more confirmation of the apparently strict relationship between the phenomena .",
    "* additionally , the inferrence that five of the six ulx are black hole x - ray binaries implies that even in very active star formation regions , the ulx phenomenon is predominantly due to accreting sources as opposed to supernovae .",
    "our knowledge of the properties of ulx is growing rapidly in the era of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. the following themes are emerging :    * ulx are a heterogeneous class , displaying a variety of different temporal and spectral x - ray characteristics , though with broad similarities in many cases . * a small number ( 10 - 20% of ulx ? ) are identifiable with recent supernovae , and the remainder appear to have the x - ray characteristics of black hole x - ray binaries . *",
    "a pattern of the spatial co - location of ulx with active star formation regions is emerging , demonstrated clearly in the case of ngc 4485/90 , implying a direct link between the presence of ulx and the ongoing star formation . *",
    "a viable model for the nature of ulx that links the two preceding points is that ulx may be high - mass x - ray binaries with their x - ray emission beamed into our line - of - sight .",
    "the case of ngc 5204 x-1 presented above strongly supports this scenario , in that we have an optical counterpart that appears to be one or more o - stars , along with possible evidence that the ulx has a rare x - ray spectral state that is similar to that observed in a galactic microquasar ( which could provide a physical basis for the beaming hypothesis ) . *",
    "a new phenomenon highlighted by our work is the presence of apparent cavities in emission - line gas immediately in the vicinity of the ulx ngc 5204 x-1 and ngc 4559 x-1 .",
    "this immediately raises questions as to the rate of occurrence and the formation and energetics of these nebulae , which will be the subject of future work .",
    "* though much circumstantial evidence now points to a model of ulx as beamed high - mass x - ray binaries , it is important to remember that there is as of yet no clear and unambiguous evidence to prove that they are not intermediate - mass black holes .",
    "it is notable that in the case of ngc 5204 x-1 the key piece of evidence in linking it to galactic microquasars is its spectral variability .",
    "since the majority of the ulx with established long - term lightcurves appear highly variable , it may be that their long - term behaviour between separate epochs will provide the key diagnostics for establishing their true natures .",
    "this will be tested with future observations ( and re - observations ! ) of the nearest ulx with both _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton_. the epic instruments on _ xmm - newton _ offer the best opportunity to constrain the x - ray spectral characteristics of ulx , and the simultaneous uv imaging with the optical monitor will allow an unprecedented view of the link between ulx and the young , hot stars associated with stellar formation regions .",
