    "soft matter interfaces play a critical role in a large number of material systems . for example , additives used in enhanced oil recovery techniques induce low interfacial tension between water and oil which helps in oil displacement and final recovery  @xcite . by controlling the types of surfactants on the interface the emulsions can be inverted  @xcite .",
    "the interplay between the interface and the surrounding fluids can be used to make skin care products , where nano - emulsions or polymer thickening agents are heavily used  @xcite .",
    "soft matter interfaces also play a crucial role in the behavior of biological systems such as red blood cells .",
    "these interfaces play a vital role since they not only acts as a protective barrier to the cell interior , but they also act as the medium of communication with the environment outside .",

    "these biological membranes are constituted of various kinds of lipids and cholesterol .",
    "as these molecules move freely in the plane of the membrane they often combine to form domains that are energetically more stable than the rest of the membrane .",
