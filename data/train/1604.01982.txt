    "the electrochemical energy thus generated by the gradient of proton concentration is utilized at the atp synthase embedded in the same membrane .",
    "the trinity of long - distance et , proton - pump , and atp synthesis is also functioning in cellular respiration for energy metabolism .",

    "this posts a marked challenge to theoretical and computational chemical physics , and has been an active area of research along with the rapid advances of computer technologies in recent years",
    ".    there exists a simple but fundamental question in biological ets on the roles of protein environments : are they playing only passive  roles of simply holding the redox moieties at appropriate spatial and orientational arrangements , or do they play some active  roles to mediate the ets by involving their electronic wave functions as bridge states ? furthermore , if the protein environments play some active roles , their details are still unclear ; for instance , whether the bridge states contribute mainly to the coherent superexchange mechanism or to the incoherent step - wise hopping ets .",
    "this aspect of quantum coherence depends on the subtle microscopic mechanism involving competition between the ets and the nuclear vibrational and conformational relaxations .",

    "all these contain @xmath3-electrons which dominate the major chemical functions including the redox properties .    in the photosynthesis , the photons",
    "are first captured by antenna systems that consist of aggregates of bchl molecules , in which the energies are stored in a form of electronic excitation .",
    "the excitation energies are then funneled to the bchl dimer , called special pair  ( p in fig .",

    "an essential key to elucidating et mechanism is the measurement of rate constant .",
    "the current standard and practically useful theory of et rate is the marcus theory @xcite , which describes the et rate @xmath4 with only a few parameters , the electronic transfer integral @xmath5 , the reaction free energy @xmath6 , and the nuclear reorganization energy @xmath7 , @xmath8 , \\label{eq : ket}\\ ] ] in which @xmath9 is the planck constant divided by @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath12 is the absolute temperature .",
    "this rate formula was derived as the semiclassical ( or high temperature ) limit of thermally averaged fermi s golden rule which is based on the time - dependent perturbation theory with respect to the electronic coupling @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , application of this formula to long - distance ets assumes that the et occurs as a quantum mechanically coherent process through the distance of et .",
    "this aspect still deserves a careful scrutiny @xcite , but in this work we assume eq .",
    "( [ eq : ket ] ) is appropriate .    among the three parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ket ] ) , the reaction free energy @xmath6 can be measured by experiments most straightforwardly .",
    "the experimental evaluation of the reorganization energy @xmath7 is less trivial , but still feasible in various ways .",
    "by contrast , the electronic transfer integral @xmath5 is the least trivial quantity , which has been estimated in practice only indirectly from other measurements .",
    "therefore , theoretical evaluation of @xmath5 is of particular importance . since eq .",
    "( [ eq : ket ] ) was derived with separation of electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom , that is , with the condon approximation , the computation of transfer integral @xmath5 has been based solely on the electronic structure calculation under the born - oppenheimer approximation .",
    "this adiabaticity aspect again deserves careful examination , but shall be assumed in this work .",
    "therefore , the essential problem now is to compute the electronic wave functions of large molecular systems involved in the biological ets .",
    "although et reactions can be described basically as a one - electron process , it is still essential to solve the many - electron problem in order to determine the major one - electron orbitals .",
    "this is because the most relevant orbitals are normally near the highest - occupied molecular orbitals ( homo ) .",
    "the computation is highly demanding for large biomolecules , but is becoming more and more feasible due to the recent advances of hardware power and numerical algorithms .",
    "two representative methods of large - scale electronic structure calculations are the fragment molecular orbital ( fmo ) method @xcite and the divide - and - conquer method @xcite . here",
    "we describe the former which was mainly employed in this work .",
    "the fmo method @xcite first decomposes the total system into fragments .",
    "the mos of each fragment are optimized self - consistently under the coulomb field of other fragments .",
    "then , dimer or trimer calculations are carried out under the coulomb field of the optimized monomer fragments in order to take account of the exchange interactions .",
    "the total energy of the system is computed with @xmath13 when up to dimer exchange interaction were considered ( fmo2 ) , and with @xmath14 when up to trimer exchange interaction were considered ( fmo3 ) . in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : fmo2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fmo3 ] ) , @xmath15 is the number of fragments , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 denote the energies of fragment monomer , dimer , and trimer , respectively . these formulas ( [ eq : fmo2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fmo3 ] ) are designed to remove the excess countings of energies with proper account of self - consistent electronic polarizations .",
    "that is , by carrying out the dimer and trimer calculations under the coulomb field of optimized monomer fragments , the excess countings of polarization energies are also properly removed .",
    "the fmo method gives accurate energies and properties , such as the dipole moments , but not the mos , of the total system .",
    "however , as will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : tda ] , what we need in order to compute the transfer integral @xmath5 are the electronic hamiltonian matrix and the mos of the total system .",
    "this requirement is fulfilled by the method of linear combinations of fmos , the fmo - lcmo method @xcite , which shall be outlined next .      in the fmo - lcmo method ,",
    "the intra - fragment  parts of the hamiltonian matrix elements are computed from the results of fmo calculations in a form similar to eqs ( [ eq : fmo2 ] ) and ( [ eq : fmo3 ] ) , whereas the inter - fragment  parts are constructed with the matrices from the dimer or trimer calculations projected to the monomer fmo space .",
    "for instance , in the fmo2 version of the method , the intra - fragment hamiltonian matrix elements are computed with a formula analogous to eq .",
    "( [ eq : fmo2 ] ) , @xmath19 and the inter - fragment matrix elements are defined as @xmath20 in which @xmath21 is the @xmath22-th orbital of fragment @xmath23 .",
    "the fock ( or kohn - sham ) matrices of fragment @xmath23 and fragment dimer @xmath24 are denoted by @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "thus , the notation @xmath27 represents the dimer fock ( or kohn - sham ) matrix projected to the monomer fmo space .",
    "because the fmos of each monomer fragment are optimized independently from other fragments , the fmos of different fragments are generally not orthogonal .",
    "this non - orthogonality should be taken into account at the diagonalization .",
    "this has been demonstrated to give accurate approximations to the canonical mos and their energies of the total system @xcite .    by deploying the total hamiltonian matrix and the mos of large systems thus obtained from the fmo - lcmo method , we have developed a scheme to analyze the long - distance et pathways with the bridge green function method and the tunneling current method .",
    "because the electron transfer integral @xmath5 is approximately proportional to the overlap between the donor and acceptor orbitals , it decays rapidly along their distance .",
    "thus , for long - distance biological ets , the transfer integral @xmath5 is normally small such that the electronically non - adiabatic regime is appropriate . the et rate of eq .",
    "( [ eq : ket ] ) assumes this non - adiabatic limit and is based on the time - dependent first - order perturbation theory in which the amplitude of the acceptor state @xmath28 is proportional to the perturbation @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the rate of et , the raise of the population @xmath29 , is proportional to @xmath30 .",
    "another assumption behind eq .",
    "( [ eq : ket ] ) is that the et is considered as an effective two - state problem .",
    "this aspect will be considered in sec .",
    "[ subsec : bgf ] . after the reduction to the effective two - state problem ,",
    "the static adiabatic energies , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , are obtained by solving the @xmath33 secular equation with the diagonal matrix elements @xmath34 and @xmath35 and the off - diagonal element @xmath5 , @xmath36 here we have omitted the dependence on the nuclear coordinates @xmath37 for simplicity : the electronic hamiltonian matrix elements , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , and hence the adiabatic energies @xmath41 , all depend on @xmath42 .",
    "thus , the adiabatic energy splitting defined by @xmath43 is twice the transfer integral @xmath5 at nuclear configurations @xmath44 of the diabatic surface crossing that gives @xmath45 , @xmath46 nevertheless , it is not a trivial task to find the diabatic surface crossing configurations @xmath44 , especially for large proteins that involve many degrees of freedom .",
    "this is the reason why we consider the generalized mulliken - hush ( gmh ) analysis and the bridge green function method that are described next .      the gmh method @xcite scales the energy splitting @xmath47 at nuclear configurations _ off _",
    "the surface crossing by a formula @xmath48 in which @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the dipole moments of the adiabatic states with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath51 is the off - diagonal element .",
    "thus , the quantities in the right - hand - side are obtained straightforwardly from the standard electronic structure calculations at any , normally the equilibrium , nuclear configurations .",
    "the idea behind this formula is an assumption that the hamiltonian matrix elements and dipole matrix elements scale similarly for states involved in ets , such that the former elements in eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltae12 ] ) are replaced by the latter elements to assume the scaling factor . despite its simplicity",
    ", the gmh formula ( [ eq : gmh ] ) has been successfully applied to a number of et reactions . in applications to large systems where the computational cost for the electronic excited state shall be the bottleneck , the energy splitting @xmath47 is replaced by that of the donor and acceptor mos from the ground - state calculation .",
    "accordingly , the dipole matrix elements of the donor - acceptor mos are also applied .",
    "this provides a computationally feasible and reasonably accurate method for the transfer integrals of large et systems .      for long - distance ets in biomolecules",
    ", the electronic hamiltonian matrix can be very large involving the intervening molecular parts between the donor and acceptor sites . in the bridge green function ( bgf )",
    "method @xcite , the electronic hamiltonian matrix is projected onto the space of a two - level system consisting of the donor and acceptor states . the reduced information in the remaining part of the system , the molecular parts that bridge and mediate the et , is taken into account via the bgf matrix .",
    "this will be formulated below in a generalized form of the effective hamiltonian method .",
    "we first divide the total hamiltonian matrix to submatrices of a target space ( p - space ) , the remaining space ( q - space ) , and their off - diagonal space .",
    "the eigenvalue problem with non - orthogonal basis is thus described by @xmath52 in which @xmath53 denotes the overlap matrix .",
    "the non - orthogonal formulation is essential because the fmos of different fragments are generally not orthogonal , as noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : fmolcmo ] . inserting the formal solution for @xmath54 from the second line of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hpq ] ) into the first line , the problem is reduced the projected smaller p - space with the effective hamiltonian @xmath55 in which @xmath56 is the green function matrix representing the contribution from the q - space ( bridge - space ) , @xmath57 with the definition of the p - space to be the donor - acceptor states or orbitals , ( @xmath58 ) , the off - diagonal element of @xmath59 corresponds to the transfer integral @xmath5 , @xmath60 in which the sums over @xmath61 and @xmath62 both exclude @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    in the effective hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ eq : heff ] ) , the energy @xmath65 is generally unknown .",
    "however , in the application to the two - state et case of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tdabgf ] ) , the energy @xmath66 is the electron tunneling energy that is most naturally defined as the average of the orbital energies of donor and acceptor orbitals , @xmath67 .    because our method employs the fmos as the basis functions , in contrast with the previous methods that employ atomic orbitals",
    ", we can directly extract pictures that reflect the chemical properties of the molecular fragments .",
    "this also applies to the tunneling current analysis to be described next .",
    "there exist a number of et pathway analysis methods . for reviews ,",
    "the most primitive ( and thus useful in practice ) would be the _ pathways _",
    "model @xcite based on an empirical green function method , whereas one of the most sophisticated at present would be that based on the _ ab initio _ multi - configuration self - consistent field ( mcscf ) method with occupation restricted multiple active space ( ormas ) model @xcite .",
    "here we employ the tunneling current method @xcite originally developed with the semi - empirical mos and based on atomic orbitals ( aos ) .",
    "by contrast , our implementation is based on the _ ab initio _ fmo - lcmo calculations which provides direct picture based on the molecular fragments with reduction of the number of basis functions compared to the ao - based methods .",
    "in addition , it allows systematic improvements of approximations , for instance , with exploits of recently emerging developments of density functional theories ( dfts ) .",
    "this last aspect is , however , out of the scope of this article .    in the tunneling current analysis ,",
    "the transfer integral @xmath5 is expressed in terms of contributions from electron current @xmath68 between basis fmos @xmath69 , @xmath70 @xmath71 in which the summation over @xmath61 and @xmath62 are over the fmos within fragments @xmath23 and @xmath72 , and @xmath73 denotes the spatial region assigned to the donor of et .",
    "the inter - orbital current @xmath68 is computed from the electronic hamiltonian and overlap matrices and the coefficients of fmo - lcmo , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , that represent the mixing of bridge fmos to the donor and acceptor fmos , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in the initial ( i ) and final ( f ) states of the et , @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "they are expressed as @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82 all these are thus computed straightforwardly from the fmo - lcmo calculation .",
    "the tunneling current method enables us to analyze long - distance et pathways in real - space .",
    "as noted above , an advantage of our implementation stems from the use of fmos as the basis functions .",
    "although it is possible to carry out similar analysis with the conventional ao - based methods by simply taking the sum within each fragments , the advantage of the fmos is that the dimension of the basis functions are about one order of magnitude smaller , and thereby the computational cost is significantly reduced .",
    "therefore , large et systems that have been only tractable by semi - empirical mo calculations are now accessible straightforwardly with the _ ab initio _ mo and dft methods .",
    "we have applied the computational strategy described in the previous section to the ets in bacterial photosynthetic reaction center . in this paper , we shall focus on the et step between the two quinones , mq and uq , via the nonheme fe@xmath0  ion complex , displayed in the lower part of fig . 1 and in fig . 2(b ) . as presented in fig 2(b ) , the fe@xmath0  ion is surrounded by five ligands from amino - acid side - chains , four histidines ( his ) and one glutamate ( glu ) . because the imidazole rings of the his ligands contain spatially delocalized low - energy @xmath3-electrons , they are likely to form the bridge states to mediate the et",
    ".      first we summarize the experimental findings . because the bacterial photosynthetic reaction center is a prototype system for studying biological energy conversions ,",
    "there exist a wealth of experimental works .",
    "the key findings to be treated in this work pertaining to the et from mq to uq via the nonheme iron complex are :    * the et time , defined by the inverse of et rate constant @xmath83 , is in the range 25  36 @xmath84s for _ blastochloris viridis _ @xcite .",

    "although @xmath7 and @xmath86 can be evaluated in principle with use of molecular dynamics simulations , their accuracy depends crucially on the reliability of the force - field model for the entire protein system , which has not been well established .",

    "for the wild - type ( wt ) complex with the high - spin ( @xmath85 ) fe@xmath0  ion , the unrestricted hartree - fock ( uhf ) method was used . for other systems in the low - spin ( @xmath89 ) state , the restricted hf ( rhf ) method was used .",

    "consequently , the computed et time was 39  45 @xmath84s , about four times slower than the wt system .",
    "this is again in qualitative accord with the experimental finding for _ rhodobacter sphaeroides _",

    "the numbers near the arrows denote the normalized et currents @xmath97 between the fragments @xmath23 and @xmath72 , which are also approximately represented by the thickness of the arrows .",
    ", scaledwidth=60.0% ]      to gain further insights into the mechanism of et , particularly with respect to the role of the nonheme iron complex , we carried out et pathway analysis described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : etpath ] .",
    "figure 3 displays the computed tunneling currents , in which the width of the arrows represents the relative contribution of the path measured by the normalized tunneling current @xmath97 . as noted in sec .",
    "[ subsec : facts ] , the experimentally found insensitivity of the et rate on the substitution and depletion of the fe@xmath0  ion have raised a conjecture that the fe@xmath0  ion does not contribute to the major et pathway . however , the computational result in fig .",
    "3(a ) indicates the contrary : the major et pathway consists of mq @xmath98 fe@xmath0@xmath98 his l190 @xmath98 uq . the resultant patterns of pathways for the high - spin ( a ) and low - spin ( b ) cases are basically very similar , but the widths of the main arrows are overall wider in the low - spin ( b ) case .",
    "nonetheless , because the contribution of the back flow from uq to fe@xmath0   is also larger in ( b ) than in ( a ) , the net et current is smaller in the low - spin system .    in the zn@xmath0-substituted system displayed in fig .",
    "3(c ) , both the forward current from mq to zn@xmath0  and the backward current from uq to zn@xmath0are reduced compared to the fe@xmath0  cases in fig .",
    "3(a ) and ( b ) .",
    "this implies that the filled ( 3d)@xmath99 ao configuration of zn@xmath0  is less effective to mediate the et than the unfilled ( 3d)@xmath100 of fe@xmath0 .",
    "however , the contribution of a pathway from mq to his m217 becomes larger in the zn@xmath0  system , as if to compensate the reduced current through the metal ion .",
    "in addition , the direction of the current from the metal ion to his m217 is reversed such that the current is now directed from his m217 to zn@xmath0 .",
    "these elucidate the electronic mechanism behind the insensitivity of the transfer integral @xmath5 and the et rate on the substitution of fe@xmath0  by zn@xmath0 .",
    "figure 3(d ) displays the corresponding pathway analysis for the metal ion depleted system .",
    "now it is clear that the pathway via his m217 and his l190 becomes dominant .",
    "consequently , the reduction of the et rate is only by a factor of 3  5 , in accord with the experimental observation .    in this way ,",
    "an intriguing picture emerges such that the his ligands play the role to secure the robustness of et by providing an auxiliary et pathway channel even in cases of disturbances such as the metal ion substitution or depletion .",
    "a new computational scheme to carry out et pathway analysis in large biomolecules has been developed and applied to the et from mq to uq via a nonheme iron ion complex in bacterial photosynthetic reaction center .",
    "the scheme consists of a combination of the fmo - lcmo method that enables _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations of large biomolecules and the tunneling current analysis that provides pictorial understanding of et mechanism . nevertheless , since any computational studies on realistic molecular systems generally involve assortments of theoretical and computational approximations , it is essential to proceed with sufficient care checking the consistency with experimental findings",
    ". then , it will become possible to discuss detailed microscopic mechanism at atomic and electronic levels that are inaccessible by experiments . with such intimate collaborations of experimental and theoretical studies",
    ", the progress of our understanding of biological energy conversions will be secured ."
