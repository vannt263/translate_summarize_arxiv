    "the evaluation of bulk properties of finite nuclei and nuclear matter starting from realistic models of nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction is a major challenge in modern nuclear physics .",
    "since the exact form of the interaction resulted from the underlying theory of the strong interaction remains unknown , one usually has deal with realistic models developed so as to fit experimental data for free nucleon - nucleon scattering up to the threshold for pion production and properties of the deuteron @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was done by obtaining a best fit for a large number of adjustable parameters using several thousands experimental points so that there exists several quite different potential models commonly used .",
    "a general feature of such realistic interactions is strong short - range and tensor components , which can not be handled within the standard perturbation theory .",
    "there have been suggested different approaches in order to overcome this problem : bethe - brueckner - goldstone expansion @xcite , correlated basis functions @xcite , quantum monte carlo @xcite , self - consistent green s function theory ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "these methods were successfully applied to describe bulk properties of nuclear matter @xcite , pairing gap of nucleons @xcite , weak response @xcite and shear viscosity of nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "however these approaches remain very complex to be applied directly to a description of finite nuclei , as well as inhomogeneous nuclear matter , also known as pasta phase , which exists in the inner crust of neutron stars .",
    "alternatively , they have been combined either to phenomenological approaches through a local density approximation  @xcite , or as an input for a density functional approach  @xcite . in these approaches ,",
    "adjustable parameters need however to be determined .    besides the realistic interactions",
    ", various phenomenological models have been developed , such as the skyrme interaction  @xcite , and adjusted to describe the experimental data for the ground states of finite nuclei and the empirical saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter .",
    "a simple parameterization of such phenomenological forces through the local single - particle densities allows a simple solution of the hartree - fock ( hf ) equations  @xcite .",
    "finally , these models have been successfully used for predictions of equations of state ( eos ) of nuclear matter and description of pasta phase within the wigner - seitz ( ws ) cell approximation  @xcite . in neutron stars",
    ", these models are extrapolated far from the condition where it has been adjusted and might in some cases become unstable  @xcite .",
    "the instabilities of these models could however be corrected such as it reproduces the features of a g - matrix in nuclear matter  @xcite .",
    "an alternative method , which is based on realistic nn interactions and allows us to perform hartree - fock calculations similarly to the phenomenological forces is the low - momentum interaction @xmath0 .",
    "the basic idea of @xmath0 is to separate the predictions for correlations at low momenta , which are constrained by the nn scattering matrix below the pion threshold , from the high - momentum components , which may strongly depend on the underlying model of realistic nn interaction . by introducing a cutoff @xmath1 in momentum space ,",
    "one separates the hilbert space into a low - momentum and a high - momentum part . the renormalization technique ( see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite ) determines an effective hamiltonian , which must be diagonalized within the model space ( below the cutoff ) . with the cutoff in the range of @xmath1",
    "= 2 @xmath2 @xmath0 becomes model independent , and reproduces the deuteron binding energy , low - energy phase shifts , and half - on - shell @xmath3 matrix with the same accuracy as the initial realistic interaction .",
    "this model independence demonstrates that the low - momentum physics does not depend on details of the high - momentum dynamics .    in spite of its obvious advantages @xmath0 potential",
    "still remains a quite complicated object . on the one hand , it is nonlocal and therefore is represented as a matrix element in momentum space for each partial wave channel .",
    "this nonlocality increases the computational time in hartree - fock iteractions , and prevents the use of @xmath0 if the number of nucleons is too large , such as in the wigner - seitz cells present in the crust of neutron stars for instance  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the renormalization technique used to produce @xmath0 seems not to be trivial .",
    "the resulting interaction is given as a matrix table which is not an easy - to - use form and prevents this potential to be popular .",
    "a possible way out is to find a separable representation of @xmath0 , since it significantly simplifies many - body calculation @xcite .",
    "moreover recent calculations of triton binding energies demonstrate the @xmath0 can be very good approximated by a low - rank separable force for low values of the cutoff @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we investigate the separability of @xmath0 by using the diagonalization of the matrix in momentum space for each partial wave channel .",
    "it allows us to find a low rank separable form of @xmath0 , which can be used in hf calculations of nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei .",
    "the @xmath0 hartree - fock calculations demonstrate a monotonic increase of the binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter as a function of the nucleon density , thus it can not reproduce the empirical saturation point @xcite",
    ". therefore we supplement @xmath0 by a simple density - dependent contact term , which accounts for a three - body correlations .",
    "this contact term is adjusted to reproduce the saturation property of symmetric matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section [ sec : nn - interaction ]",
    "we discuss the model space technique used to produce @xmath0 and outline the procedure to determine the separable representation . in the last section [ sec : results ] we sum up all results and suggest a simple fit for separable representation of @xmath0 as well as two different parameterizations of the contact term , adjusted for the fitted potential .",
    "the main idea of @xmath0 interaction is to disentangle the low - momentum or long - range part of a realistic nn interaction , which is fairly well described in terms of meson - exchange , from the high - momentum or short - range part where quark degrees of freedom are getting important . in other words",
    ", one defines a model space , which accounts for the low - momentum degrees of freedom and renormalizes the effective hamiltonian for this low - momentum regime in order to account for the effects of the high - momentum components , which are integrated out .    in practice",
    "the @xmath0 interaction can be derived either using model space methods ( such as lee - suzuki @xcite or okubo @xcite ) or through an renormalization group treatment @xcite .",
    "both approaches are essentially equivalent and lead to the same energy - independent potential @xcite . in the following",
    "we will use the model space technique to disentangle these parts based on the unitary model operator approach ( umoa ) .",
    "this approach has frequently been described in the literature @xcite .",
    "therefore we will restrict the presentation only to basic equations , which will define the nomenclature .    to determine the model space , the low - momentum subspace of hilbert space",
    ", one defines a projection operator @xmath4 , which projects onto this model space .",
    "the complement of the subspace will be defined by the projection operator @xmath5 , in such a way that the whole space is covered by these two operators .",
    "thus they satisfy the following relations @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 .",
    "the unitary model operator approach defines a unitary transformation @xmath10 in such a way that the transformed hamiltonian does not couple the @xmath11 and @xmath5 space , i.e. , @xmath12 now the effective two - body interaction of hermitian type can be determined in terms of unitary transformation @xmath10 as @xmath13 where @xmath14 stands for the bare nn interaction .",
    "the operator @xmath15 denotes the one - body part of the two - body system and contains the kinetic energy of the interacting particles .",
    "it is important to notice that in any case @xmath15 commutes with the projection operators @xmath11 and @xmath5 .",
    "as it was shown by suzuki @xcite the operator @xmath16 is expressed as @xmath17 where an operator @xmath18 fulfills relations @xmath19 and @xmath20 . to evaluate the matrix elements of this operator @xmath18 one",
    "should first solve the two - body eigenvalue equation @xmath21 from eigenstates @xmath22 we determine those eigenstates @xmath23 , which have the largest overlap with the @xmath11 space .",
    "after the respective matrix elements of @xmath18 and later @xmath10 may be defined in terms of @xmath24 eigenstates .",
    "this matrix element of @xmath10 can then be used to determine the matrix elements of the effective interaction @xmath25 in @xmath11 space ( for the details see @xcite ) . in this way , one obtains the effective hamiltonian @xmath26 .",
    "diagonalising it in the low - momentum model space ( @xmath11 space ) , one obtains eigenvalues which are identical to the diagonalization of the original hamiltonian @xmath27 in the complete space .",
    "moreover , the solution of the lippmann - schwinger equation for nn scattering phase shifts using @xmath0 with a cutoff @xmath1 yields the same phase shifts as obtained from original interaction @xmath14 without a cutoff .",
    "if the underlying interaction is a realistic interaction , fitted to reproduce the experimental phase shifts below @xmath1 , these phase shifts will be also reproduced by @xmath0 .",
    "if the cutoff @xmath1 is chosen around @xmath1 = 2 @xmath2 the resulting @xmath0 is found to be essentially model independent , i.e. , is independent on the underlying realistic interaction @xmath14 . in this sense",
    "@xmath0 is unique and , as it reproduces the nn scattering phase shifts it can also be regarded as a realistic interaction as , e.g. , the cd - bonn @xcite or argonne v18 @xcite potentials .",
    "originally @xmath0 is nonlocal and defined in terms of matrix elements in a basis of nn states labeled by relative momentum for pairs of nucleons .",
    "thus for each partial wave channel there exists a matrix , which represents @xmath28 on a mesh of @xmath29 discretized relative momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the range @xmath32 .",
    "since this matrix is real and symmetric with respect to @xmath33 one can diagonalize it , so that , it can be written as a sum of @xmath29 real eigenvalues multiplied with the respective eigenvectors @xmath34 where @xmath29 is the number of mesh - points and the dimension of @xmath0 matrix .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath35 satisfy the orthogonality relation @xmath36 in the following we will omit the symbol of complex conjugation because all eigenvectors are real .",
    "the last equality ( [ eq : sep - form ] ) is nothing else but the general definition of a separable potential of the rank @xmath29 .",
    "if the rank of the separable potential equals the dimension of the matrix @xmath28 the whole information is exactly restored from the eigenvalues @xmath37 and eigenvectors @xmath38 .",
    "as we will see later , some of eigenvalues @xmath37 can be zero or negligibly small so that one can reduce the rank of separable interaction taking into account only the @xmath39 eigenvalues with largest absolute values .",
    "it leads to a new approximated separable interaction @xmath40}_{\\text{low - k}}(k , k')$ ] @xmath41}_{\\text{low - k}}(k , k')=\\sum\\limits^n_{i=1 } a_i f_i(k)f_i(k ' ) , \\hspace{1 cm } ( n\\le n ) .",
    "\\label{eq : sep - fit - form}\\ ] ] the low - rank separable representation of nn interaction leads to significant simplifications in many - body calculations .",
    "the effective interaction @xmath0 as well as its separable form is nonlocal and defined in terms of matrix elements in momentum space .",
    "it implies that the hf calculations has to be performed in a hilbert space using an appropriate basis @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 the hf hamiltonian is then expressed in terms of the matrix elements between these basis states @xmath45 and the hf single - particle ( s .- p . )",
    "states @xmath46 are expressed through the expansion coefficients in the basis @xmath47 the part of the hf hamiltonian originating from @xmath0 can be expressed in terms of two - body matrix elements by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the single - particle density matrix . in order to investigate the bulk properties of finite nuclei we perform hf calculations within the spherical wigner - seitz cell assuming a plane wave single - particle basis @xcite .",
    "in the following we discuss results for symmetric nuclear matter as well as finite nuclei obtained from hf calculations . these calculations are performed in the model space , which is defined by a cutoff parameter @xmath1 in the two - body scattering equation , employing the corresponding low - momentum interaction @xmath0 , which is derived from the cd - bonn @xcite interaction using the technique described in sec.[sec : nn - interaction ] .",
    "the nn interaction has been restricted to partial waves with total angular momentum @xmath50 less equal 6 .",
    "we start our discussion with the comparison of the eigenvalues @xmath37 obtained from diagonalization of @xmath51 matrix of @xmath28 in @xmath52 channel .",
    "the resulted nonzero eigenvalues are shown on the top of fig.[fig:1s0_eigenvalues ] for different values of @xmath1 . as it was discussed above",
    ", @xmath0 interaction becomes model independent at @xmath1 = 2 @xmath2 . at this value of the cutoff parameter @xmath1",
    "the diagonalization procedure yields only 11 nonzero eigenvalues , other words , @xmath0 interaction in @xmath52 channel is a separable interaction of the 11@xmath53 rank or , following ( [ eq : sep - form ] ) , one can write @xmath54}_{\\text{low - k}}(k , k')=v_{\\text{low - k}}(k , k').\\ ] ] the nonzero eigenvalues are essentially independent on @xmath29 , the dimension of the matrix representing @xmath0 .",
    "going further one can notice , that many of the nonzero eigenvalues are nevertheless very small , and only some of them , e.g. , at @xmath55 carry the main part of the information about the interaction model .",
    "this gives rise to a substantial lowering of the rank of separable potential , as it was shown in eq.([eq : sep - fit - form ] ) . with the increase of the cutoff",
    "@xmath1 the absolute values of the eigenvalues increase as well and as a consequence the rank @xmath39 of the separable form @xmath40}_{\\text{low - k}}$ ] defined in ( [ eq : sep - fit - form ] ) has to be increased to achieve a reasonable accuracy . increasing @xmath1 more information about the short - range components of the underlying bare interaction",
    "is included , which requires a larger rank in the separable representation of the interaction .    in case of the coupled channels , like @xmath56-@xmath57 channel ,",
    "the dimension @xmath29 of the @xmath0 matrix is twice as large if one keeps the number of mesh - points in each channel the same as for the uncoupled partial waves .",
    "it turns out that also the number of nonzero eigenvalues increases as shown in the lower panel of fig.[fig:1s0_eigenvalues ] .",
    "it is obvious that the rank of the separable potential should be higher than for @xmath52 channel .",
    "it is a general feature that coupled channels require higher rank separable interaction than the uncoupled ones @xcite . also one observes pairs of positive and negative eigenvalues which have about the same absolute value .",
    "this picture remains for higher values of @xmath1 . as we will see later",
    ", this symmetry between positive and negative eigenvalues will play a crucial role in the convergence of the separable form @xmath40}_{\\text{low - k}}$ ] to the initial @xmath0 with increase of rank . in order to determine a minimal rank for a reliable separable approximation in each channel we calculate the square deviation @xmath58 of the separable form @xmath40}_{\\text{low - k}}$ ] from the original potential @xmath0 for each rank @xmath39 @xmath59}_{\\text{low - k}}(k , k')\\right|^2 /\\sum_{k , k'}\\left| v_{\\text{low - k}}(k , k')\\right|^2.\\ ] ] in fig.[fig : deviation1s0 ] the deviation for @xmath52 channel at different values of the cutoff @xmath1 is shown . at @xmath1 = 2 @xmath2",
    "one observes a fast convergence to zero deviation already at the rank @xmath60 .",
    "the growth of the cutoff monotonically increases the rank of the separable potential . at @xmath1 = 3 @xmath2",
    "one may expect a good accuracy starting from @xmath61 .",
    "the deviation @xmath58 for @xmath56-@xmath57 channel is displayed in fig.[fig : deviation3s1 ] .",
    "first , at low @xmath39 the absolute value of the deviation is one order of magnitude higher than for uncoupled @xmath52 channel .",
    "increasing the rank one observes a non - monotonic , oscillating decrease of @xmath58 , specially for high @xmath1 .",
    "as we have seen , the diagonalization of the channel @xmath56-@xmath57 yields both positive and negative eigenvalues , which are symmetrically distributed over @xmath62 .",
    "so that they form `` pairs '' with very similar absolute values . assuming the odd rank we take into account either uncompensated positive or negative eigenvalue .",
    "this eigenvalue will be compensated in the next ( even ) rank , and the accuracy will be significantly improved .",
    "the deviation @xmath58 for various other channels at @xmath1 = 2 @xmath2 is shown in figs.[fig : deviation_uncoupl ] ,  [ fig : deviation_coupl ] . in the following",
    "we choose the second rank approximation for the uncoupled channels ( @xmath60 ) and the third rank for the coupled one ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "below , the respective separable version of @xmath0 will be referred to as @xmath64}_{\\text{low - k}}$ ] .",
    "now let us turn to the binding energy of symmetric nuclear matter , which is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm ] . the hf calculations using @xmath64}_{\\text{low - k}}$ ] ( dashed line ) yields essentially the same result as the one employing the original @xmath0 interaction ( solid curve ) .",
    "the deviation does not exceed @xmath65 at the saturation density @xmath66 and @xmath67 at the density @xmath68 .",
    "we also compared the binding energy of pure neutron matter for both potentials and found that the discrepancy is less than @xmath65 for the same range of densities .    however , neither of the 2 calculations yields a saturation point , i.e. a minimum in the energy versus density plot , as it has been observed before @xcite .",
    "this absence of the saturation is one of the main problems in calculations of nuclear matter employing @xmath0 .",
    "it can not be cured by the inclusion of correlations beyond the hf approximation , e.g. , by means of the bhf approximation @xcite .",
    "recent relativistic calculations by van dalen and mther demonstrate that saturation can be achieved within the @xmath0 approach by inclusion of relativistic effects in dressing the dirac spinors which are used to evaluate the underlying realistic interaction @xcite .",
    "all the results obtained so far indicate that @xmath64}_{\\text{low - k}}$ ] is an accurate low - rank separable representation of @xmath0 interaction .",
    "however , in order to make it accessible to other users , it should be parameterized in a simple form . here",
    "we suggest the fitting function for all @xmath35 in all channels @xmath69 which contains 7 parameters for each partial wave channel and each @xmath35 . in the table [",
    "tab : uncoupled ] , we summarized all parameters of the separable fitted form for uncoupled channels , while all parameters for the coupled channels are shown in the table [ tab : coupled ] . by using the values from both tables",
    "one can reproduce the fitted version of @xmath64}_{\\text{low - k}}$ ] for a given partial wave channel . in the following",
    "we will identify the respective separable fitted potential as @xmath64}_{\\text{fit}}$ ] .    in order to check the accuracy of our fit",
    "we perform hf calculations of nuclear matter employing @xmath64}_{\\text{fit}}$ ] .",
    "the respective binding energy as a function of the density of symmetric nuclear matter are displayed on fig.[fig : sm ] by a dashed - dotted line .",
    "one observes that at up to saturation density @xmath70 @xmath71 the fitted potential @xmath64}_{\\text{fit}}$ ] reproduces the results of @xmath64}_{\\text{low - k}}$ ] ( red dashed ) , while at higher densities it becomes slightly less bound and lies closer to the original @xmath0 ( solid ) .",
    "thus the deviation of the fitted separable potential @xmath64}_{\\text{fit}}$ ] from @xmath0 does not exceed @xmath65 of binding energy .",
