    "physically meaningful interpretation of the measurement of relative motion from the point of view of an accelerated observer in a gravitational field requires the introduction of a special coordinate system ( i.e.  fermi coordinates ) along the worldline of the observer . in this coordinate system ,",
    "the equations of relative motion reveal tidal and inertial effects for ultrarelativistic motion ( with speed exceeding the critical value @xmath0 ) that are contrary to newtonian expectations .",
    "while there are general treatments of inertial and tidal effects in fermi coordinates  @xcite and the special case of ultrarelativistic motion of particles has been discussed in our recent papers  @xcite , the purpose of this work is to present a more systematic and complete description of motion beyond the critical speed @xmath0 . to this end",
    ", the equations of motion in fermi coordinates are discussed in section  [ s0 ] and inertial effects are considered in sections  [ s2 ] , [ s3 ] and appendix a. section  [ s4 ] is devoted to tidal effects .",
    "a summary and brief discussion of our results is contained in section  [ s5 ] .",
    "imagine an accelerated observer in a general relativistic spacetime following a worldline @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the proper time along its trajectory .",
    "the local axes of the observer are given by an orthonormal tetrad frame @xmath3 that is carried along its path according to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the antisymmetric acceleration tensor , @xmath6 is the local temporal direction and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , form the local spatial triad , and where ( here and throughout this paper ) greek indices run from 0 to 3 , latin indices run from 1 to 3 , the signature of the metric is @xmath9 and @xmath10 , unless specified otherwise .    in analogy with the electromagnetic faraday tensor",
    ", we decompose the acceleration tensor into its `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' components @xmath11 ; these are given by the translational acceleration @xmath12 and the rotational frequency @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "that is , the acceleration of the reference trajectory is given by @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the frequency of rotation of the spatial triad with respect to a local nonrotating ( i.e.  fermi - walker transported ) triad .",
    "let us next establish a fermi coordinate system @xmath16 in a neighborhood of the reference worldline  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that fermi coordinates can be assigned uniquely only to spacetime events that are within a cylindrical region of finite radius along the observer s worldline . at each event @xmath1 on the observer s worldline , consider all spacelike geodesic curves that are normal to this reference worldline at this event .",
    "each event @xmath17 on the resulting hypersurface and within the cylindrical region under consideration is connected to @xmath1 by a unique spacelike geodesic curve that starts at @xmath1 and whose tangent vector @xmath18 at this event is normal to the reference worldline ( that is , @xmath19 ) .",
    "the event @xmath17 is assigned the fermi coordinates @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the proper length of the normal spacelike geodesic segment connecting @xmath1 to @xmath17 .",
    "the fermi coordinate system is admissible in a cylindrical spacetime region around @xmath1 with radius @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the minimum radius of curvature of spacetime along the reference worldline  @xcite .",
    "the observer , at each instant @xmath26 of its proper time `` sees '' a locally euclidean three - dimensional space and `` instantaneously '' determines distances within it using the ( spacelike ) geodesic lengths beginning from its position at the spatial origin of the new fermi coordinates .",
    "a nearby particle worldline that punctures the sequence of three - dimensional spaces at @xmath27 is thus a graph over the reference worldline and each point on the graph is connected to the observer by a `` locally straight '' line ( i.e.  a geodesic ) that is normal to the observer s worldline . from the viewpoint of the observer",
    ", the particle has relative coordinate velocity @xmath28 and relative coordinate acceleration @xmath29 .",
    "the general equation of motion for a test particle of mass @xmath30 in the fermi frame is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the proper time along its worldline , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 is the external force acting on the particle .    equation   can be written as the system @xmath35 using the identity @xmath36 and the lorentz factor of the particle @xmath37 equation   can be expressed as @xmath38    let @xmath39 .",
    "we note that @xmath40 and the physical content of the equation of motion   is contained in equation   together with @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "these can be written respectively as @xmath43 and @xmath44 it is crucial to recognize that in fermi coordinates the velocity @xmath45 satisfies the condition @xmath46 only at @xmath47 ; indeed , away from the reference trajectory @xmath48 could in principle exceed unity in accordance with the equation of motion  .",
    "it is natural to begin our discussion with an accelerated observer in minkowski spacetime . in this case ,",
    "spacelike geodesic segments are straight lines ; therefore , the construction of fermi coordinates is simple .",
    "in fact , equation   reduces to @xmath49 . differentiating this relation we find that @xmath50{\\rm d}x^0+\\lambda^\\mu _ { \\;\\;(i ) } { \\rm d}x^i,\\ ] ] where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are given by @xmath53 the components @xmath54 of the minkowski metric tensor in fermi coordinates are given by @xmath55 moreover , @xmath56 and the inverse metric is given by @xmath57",

    "we note that the structure of the boundary region @xmath63 has been discussed in detail  @xcite . in general",
    ", the boundary of the admissible region at a given time @xmath59 is a real quadric cone . if @xmath64 , this surface degenerates into coincident planes .",
    "moreover , if @xmath65 , but @xmath66 , the boundary surface is a hyperbolic cylinder for @xmath67 , a parabolic cylinder for @xmath68 , and an elliptic cylinder for @xmath69 .",
    "as is well known , for @xmath70 , the boundary surface is a circular cylinder of radius @xmath71 .",
    "we now consider the equations of motion in fermi coordinates .",
    "equations   and   are given by @xmath72 hence , equation   has the form @xmath73 where @xmath74 represents the external force per unit mass @xmath75 .\\ ] ] it is interesting to note that in equation   the purely rotational inertial accelerations are essentially the same as in the nonrelativistic theory  @xcite .",
    "inertial accelerations have been discussed by a number of authors  @xcite . in particular , it has been shown  @xcite that for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the inertial acceleration experienced by the particle parallel to its motion is given to lowest order in @xmath78 by @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the unit vector tangent to the spatial path of the particle ; therefore , there is a sign reversal for @xmath81 with consequences that are contrary to newtonian expectations .",
    "note that the acceleration @xmath82 and the inertial acceleration @xmath78 occur in rather different ways in equation  .",
    "this difference is a consequence of the absolute character of acceleration in the theory of relativity ; that is , the fact that an observer is accelerated is independent of the choice of coordinates . in particular , while the critical speed associated with @xmath82 is @xmath83 ( on the basis of equation  ) , the critical speed associated with @xmath78 in equation   is @xmath0 .    to obtain the limiting case of lightlike motion ,",
    "we let @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is an affine parameter . in the limit as @xmath86",
    ", we have that @xmath87 ; hence , equation   is valid with @xmath88 ( see  appendix a ) .",
    "for a rindler observer  @xcite ( that is , an observer in hyperbolic motion in minkowski spacetime ) , consider an inertial frame in which the rindler observer is at rest at @xmath89 and has uniform translational acceleration @xmath90 along the @xmath91-axis . the observer s worldline is given by @xmath92 the nonrotating orthonormal tetrad frame along this worldline has the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 and @xmath95 , and the transformation from fermi to inertial coordinates is @xmath96 the rindler coordinates are admissible for @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we note that the manifold where @xmath99 is the rindler horizon .",
    "it is related to the null cone in the inertial frame , since equations   and   imply that @xmath100 .",
    "imagine a free particle moving along the @xmath91-axis with speed @xmath101 , @xmath102 , according to @xmath103 from the viewpoint of the rindler observer , this motion is given by @xmath104 for @xmath105 , the particle descends monotonically toward the horizon .",
    "for @xmath106 , its path crosses the path of the rindler observer @xmath107 at two events corresponding to @xmath108 and @xmath109 , where @xmath110 this value corresponds to inertial time @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is the lorentz factor associated with @xmath101 . at either event @xmath113 on the other hand , @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "that is , the free particle ascends from @xmath116 to @xmath117 at @xmath118 such that @xmath119 , then descends back to @xmath116 at @xmath120 and finally approaches the horizon @xmath99 as @xmath121 . for @xmath122 ,",
    "the particle has no acceleration at the crossing events .",
    "we note that for ultrarelativistic motion beyond the critical speed @xmath123 , the inertial acceleration of the free particle has the opposite sign at crossing events compared to intuitive expectations based on newtonian mechanics ; but , other aspects of the motion are not affected .",
    "for instance , the critical speed does not appear to play a role in the proper temporal intervals between the crossing events .",
    "the relevant proper time of the rindler observer @xmath120 given by equation   is always less than the proper time of the free particle @xmath124 , since for @xmath125 , @xmath126 that is , the length of the geodesic segment is maximum .",
    "this circumstance , usually called `` the twin paradox , '' is a reflection of the absolute character of acceleration in the theory of relativity .    for the limiting case of a null ray ( @xmath127 ) , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "the ray thus ascends monotonically toward infinity or descends monotonically toward the horizon always with positive acceleration .",
    "moreover , the fermi coordinate speed of the ray can range from zero to infinity .",
    "we now turn our attention to motion in a gravitational field @xcite .",
    "the spacetime metric in fermi coordinates then takes the form @xmath130 where @xmath131 is the projection of the riemann tensor on the tetrad frame of the observer .    to simplify matters ,",
    "we concentrate on tidal effects only and assume that the observer follows a geodesic along which a fermi coordinate system is constructed based on a parallel - propagated tetrad frame .",
    "moreover , we neglect external forces on the test particle . in this case , the equations of motion of the free particle in the fermi system , i.e.  equations ",
    ", reduce to @xmath132 and @xmath133 equality holds for null rays @xmath134 . in this case",
    "the right - hand side of equation   is a first integral of the differential equation   and higher - order tidal terms can not be neglected .",
    "the fermi coordinate system is admissible within a cylindrical region along the observer s worldline with @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the supremum of @xmath137 .",
    "equation   is the _ geodesic deviation equation _ in fermi coordinates , since it represents the relative motion of the free particle with respect to the fiducial observer that has been assumed here to follow a geodesic .    to illustrate the tidal effects for test particles and null rays",
    ", we consider the gravitational field of a kerr black hole .",
    "the kerr metric , in boyer - lindquist coordinates @xmath138 , is given by @xmath139 where @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the kerr source has mass @xmath142 and angular momentum @xmath143 . for a black hole ,",
    "the specific angular momentum @xmath144 is such that @xmath145 . the observer is taken to be on an escape trajectory along the axis of rotation : it starts at @xmath146 with @xmath147 on this axis and moves radially outward reaching infinity with zero kinetic energy .",
    "its geodesic worldline is given by @xmath148    to determine fermi coordinates , we choose a nonrotating orthonormal tetrad frame along the observer s worldline such that @xmath149 is parallel to the @xmath91-axis . in @xmath138 coordinates , we have @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 are given in display  . using the axial symmetry of the spacetime , @xmath153 and @xmath154",
    "can be chosen uniquely up to a rotation about the @xmath91-axis .",
    "once a pair is chosen at @xmath146 , then @xmath155 and @xmath156 are parallel propagated along the reference worldline .",
    "we do not require the explicit transformation from boyer - lindquist to fermi coordinates to obtain the curvature components that appear in the approximate equations of motion  . indeed , the symmetries of the riemann tensor make it possible to represent these quantities as elements of a symmetric @xmath157 matrix with indices that range over the set @xmath158 .",
    "the result is @xmath159,\\ ] ] where @xmath160 and @xmath161 are @xmath162 matrices that are symmetric and traceless and correspond respectively to the electric and magnetic parts of the riemann tensor .",
    "moreover , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , where @xmath165 the curvature components are computed along the worldline of the observer , i.e.  at @xmath166 in fermi coordinates .",
    "the electric and magnetic curvatures in and , respectively , only depend upon @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , it suffices to integrate the equation for @xmath168 in to obtain @xmath169 , which when substituted in and with @xmath170 results in @xmath171 and @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "the equation of motion can thus be written as the system @xmath173=0,\\\\ \\label{eq45 } \\ddot{y } & -\\frac{1}{2}ky \\left ( 1 - 2\\dot{y}^2+\\frac{4}{3 } \\dot{x}^2- \\frac{2}{3 } \\dot{z}^2\\right ) + \\frac{1}{3 } k\\dot{y } ( 5x\\dot{x}-7z\\dot{z})\\nonumber \\\\ & -q [ \\dot{x } \\dot{y } \\dot{z } y-\\dot{z } x ( 1+\\dot{y}^2 ) -2\\dot{x } z]=0,\\\\ \\label{eq46 } \\ddot{z } & + kz \\left [ 1 - 2\\dot{z } ^2+\\frac{1}{3 } ( \\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2)\\right ] + \\frac{2}{3 } k\\dot{z } ( x\\dot{x } + y\\dot{y } ) \\nonumber\\\\ & -q ( x\\dot{y } -\\dot{x } y)(1-\\dot{z}^2)=0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have neglected higher - order tidal terms for the sake of simplicity .",
    "these generalized jacobi equations reduce to the standard jacobi equations when the relative motion is so slow that the velocity terms can be neglected .",
    "consider , for instance , the one - dimensional motion of the test particle along the @xmath91-direction . equations - with @xmath174 for @xmath175 reduce to @xmath176 the behavior of the solutions of this equation , which contains the critical speed @xmath177 , has been studied in detail in our previous work @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath178 and @xmath179 ; then , the particle starts from the observer s location and decelerates along the @xmath91-axis toward the critical speed @xmath180 . in this case",
    "@xmath181 given by equation reduces to @xmath182 whose behavior is depicted in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "this extends our previous results  @xcite and is consistent with the rapid decrease of curvature @xmath183 away from the black hole .",
    "a more interesting situation arises for motion normal to the direction of rotation of the black hole",
    ". equations  with @xmath184 for @xmath175 reduce to @xmath185 which turns out to be the general equation for one - dimensional radial motion perpendicular to the rotation axis of the black hole as a consequence of the axial symmetry of the configuration under consideration here .",
    "the corresponding lorentz factor is given by as @xmath186 we note that for ultrarelativistic motion , the particles gain tidal energy and reach the speed of light as in figure  [ fig:2 ] for an extreme kerr black hole @xmath187 and in figure  [ fig:3 ] for a schwarzschild black hole @xmath188 .",
    "it follows from a comparison of figures  [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] that the tidal acceleration mechanism does not depend sensitively upon the specific angular momentum of the black hole ; in fact , it appears that the time it takes for @xmath189 to diverge is in general slightly longer for @xmath190 as compared to the @xmath191 case .",
    "moreover , the divergence of @xmath189 indicates that our test - particle approach breaks down .",
    "in two recent papers  @xcite , we approximated @xmath189 by @xmath192 and plotted its approach toward infinity as a consequence of the ultrarelativistic tidal acceleration mechanism .",
    "the present calculation of @xmath189 is based on an improved approximation scheme and goes beyond our previous work . to reach the speed of light  or , equivalently , for the timelike particle worldline to become null  the fermi speed @xmath193 should reach a value that is greater than unity as @xmath183 in equation   is negative .",
    "we expect that this value of @xmath193 is reached at a later time @xmath59 as demonstrated by a comparison of figures  [ fig:2 ] and  [ fig:3 ] with our previous results  @xcite .",
    "even the present calculations are approximate as they are based on dropping the higher - order tidal terms .",
    "it is clear that at a sufficiently long time @xmath194 , the fermi coordinate system breaks down .",
    "the kinematic breakdown of fermi coordinates , i.e.  their inadmissibility , is logically independent of the divergence of @xmath189 , which indicates the failure of the dynamical theory presented here .",
    "our test - particle approximation ignores any back reaction ; furthermore , for charged particles the electromagnetic field configuration near the black hole could enhance or hinder the tidal acceleration mechanism . in any case",
    ", this breakdown of our dynamics nevertheless implies that sufficiently energetic particles emerge from the vicinity of the black hole after having experienced tidal acceleration by the gravitational field of the collapsed source . in this way ,",
    "highly energetic particles may be created by microquasars in our galaxy .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the tidal acceleration mechanism is independent of the horizon structure of the black hole .",
    "these results are interesting in connection with the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays since cosmic rays with energies above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin limit @xmath195 are not expected to reach the earth from distant galaxies @xcite .",
    "fermi coordinates constitute a geodesic coordinate system that is a natural extension of the standard cartesian system and is indispensable for the theory of measurement in relativistic physics .",
    "we have discussed the general equation of motion of a pointlike test particle , as well as the limiting case of a null ray , in fermi coordinates .",
    "inertial and tidal effects of ultrarelativistic particles with speeds above the critical speed @xmath196 have been emphasized .",
    "this work goes beyond our previous work in this direction and strengthens the basis for our results and conclusions @xcite .",
    "let us compute the effective external force per unit mass given by equation for the electromagnetic case , namely , @xmath197 in accordance with the lorentz force law for the motion of a particle of charge @xmath198 in an external field @xmath199 . neglecting radiation reaction",
    ", we find that @xmath200 where @xmath85 is the affine parameter defined by @xmath201 .",
    "a massless charged particle does not exist ; therefore , we assume that @xmath202 as @xmath86 . with this assumption",
    ", it turns out that the massless limit of the trajectory of a charged particle is a null geodesic .",
    "there exist nongeodesic null curves in minkowski spacetime .",
    "these may be physically interpreted as follows : imagine the path of a null electromagnetic ray that is reflected from a collection of mirrors fixed in different places in space .",
    "the path consists of straight ( i.e.  geodesic ) null segments separated by mirrors .",
    "next imagine a limiting situation involving an infinite number of such idealized pointlike mirrors .",
    "the resulting smooth curve is a nongeodesic null curve .",
    "an example of such a curve is @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 are constants .",
    "the generalization to curved spacetime is straightforward .",
