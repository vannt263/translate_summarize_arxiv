    "<S> in scaling of transistor dimensions with low source - to - drain currents , 1d semiconductors with certain electronic properties are highly desired . </S>",
    "<S> we discover three new 1d materials , sbsei , sbsi and sbsbr with high stability and novel electronic properties based on first principles calculations </S>",
    "<S> . both dynamical and thermal stability of these 1d materials are examined . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk - to-1d transition results in dramatic changes in band gap , effective mass and static dielectric constant due to quantum confinement , making 1d sbsei a highly promising channel material for transistors with gate length shorter than 1 nm . under small uniaxial strain , these materials are transformed from indirect into direct band gap semiconductors , paving the way for optoelectronic devices and mechanical sensors . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> the thermoelectric performance of these materials is significantly improved over their bulk counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we demonstrate the experimental feasibility of synthesizing such atomically sharp v - vi - vii compounds . </S>",
    "<S> these highly desirable properties render sbsei , sbsi and sbsbr promising 1d materials for applications in future microelectronics , optoelectronics , mechanical sensors , and thermoelectrics .    </S>",
    "<S> as transistors are scaled down continually following moore s law , a scaling limit of 5 nm arises from short channel effect that increases source - to - drain tunneling @xcite . recently , 2d mos@xmath0 transistors with 1 nm gate lengths have been made using 1d single - walled carbon nanotube gate @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the introduction of semiconductors with large band gap , heavy effective mass , and low dielectric constant , like mos@xmath0 , can lead to further scaling of transistor dimensions with low direct source - to - drain tunneling currents @xcite . considering shrinking transistor dimensions , 1d semiconductors with such properties </S>",
    "<S> are highly sought .    </S>",
    "<S> 1d crystals represent the sharpest form of crystalline solids , and exhibit many exotic properties that are absent in their bulk counterpart , such as high mechanical strength and flexibility @xcite , promising white - light emission @xcite , and enhanced piezoelectric @xcite and thermoelectric performance @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> carbon nanotube transistors have been fabricated for decades @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , metallic and semiconducting carbon nanotubes are typically grown together as bundles , and for well - controlled transport properties , separating tubes with suitable electronic properties remains a challenge , which limits their industrial feasibility @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus the identification of experimentally feasible 1d materials for applications in electronic devices is of utmost importance . here </S>",
    "<S> , we show an _ ab initio _ calculation evidence of three novel 1d v - vi - vii compounds , sbsei , sbsbr and sbsi , with high stability and desired electronic properties .    before the discovery of graphene @xcite , monolayer mos@xmath0 @xcite , and black phosphorene @xcite , studies on their bulk counterparts are well ahead of the 2d form . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , properties of bulk v - vi - vii compounds are well known much earlier than their 1d form . </S>",
    "<S> bulk v - vi - vii semiconductor has a orthorhombic structure with the space group of @xmath1 , and crystallises in 1d chains which are held together by van der waals interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> bulk v - vi - vii semiconductors are earth abundant materials @xcite , and with chained structures , these materials may be good precursors for 1d crystals by exfoliation or mechanical cleavage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the lack of knowledge on the properties of 1d v - vi - vii compounds , little research has been conducted on the isolation of the chain . historically , bulk v - vi - vii compounds attracted tremendous interest in the 1960 s due to promising ferroelectric properties @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last five years have witnessed the renaissance of these materials for photovoltaic applications beyond perovskites @xcite , because ( i ) orienting crystal growth perpendicular to the substrate sustains excellent carrier transport along the chains , ( ii ) benign grain boundaries parallel to the chains are free of dangling bonds and hence cause little recombination loss @xcite , and ( iii ) needle - like crystals aligned in the translational direction of the growth exhibit better photovoltaic response than their higher dimensional counterparts @xcite . for applications in field - effect transistors , </S>",
    "<S> the achilles heel of bulk v - vi - vii semiconductors is smaller band gap , lighter effective mass and much higher dielectric constant than 2d mos@xmath0 @xcite , which seriously reduces their potential . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we show for the first time that the bulk - to-1d transition is accompanied by an abrupt switch in band gap , effective mass and dielectric constant , distinguishing 1d sbsei as a promising channel material for next generation field - effect transistors .        </S>",
    "<S> v - vi - vii compounds have similar structures , thus we take the model of sbsei hereafter . </S>",
    "<S> the pbe - d2 optimized structure of bulk sbsei is shown in figure  [ 1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the computed lattice constants of sbsei , sbsi and sbsbr are listed in table  s1 in the supporting information , all in good agreement with previous result @xcite , indicating that the theoretical methods chosen for this system is reliable . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure of isolated 1d sbsei is shown in figure  [ 1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of atomically sharp 1d sbsei is an important issue to be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> a material is dynamically stable when no imaginary phonon frequencies exist @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon dispersion shows real frequencies across the brillouin zone in figure  [ 1](c ) , indicating that these structures are kinetically stable at 0 k. v - vi - vii compounds are phase transition materials , thus , to examine the thermal stability of their 1d counterparts , we carry out first - principles molecular dynamics simulations in canonical ensemble . at 300 k , a 1@xmath21@xmath26 supercell </S>",
    "<S> is used with a time step of 2 fs . </S>",
    "<S> a snapshot of atomically sharp sbsei is shown in figure  [ 1](d ) with a total simulation time of 8 ps . no bond is broken and the structure integrity is well kept as its equilibrium structure at 0 k , suggesting good thermal stability .     point , with an isosurface level of 0.004 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> .calculated pbe - d2 and hse06 band gap , hole and electron effective mass , and static dielectric constant along the @xmath3 direction of 1d sbsei , sbsi and sbsbr . </S>",
    "<S> previous theoretical results of bulk sbsei , sbsi , sbsbr and 2d mos@xmath0 are also given in parentheses for comparison . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ t2 ]    the applications of 1d semiconductors in field - effect transistors are governed by the carrier mobility as well . </S>",
    "<S> although 1d sbsei has large effective mass , the acoustic phonon limited carrier mobility is also determined by the deformation potential and the 1d elastic modulus @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these data and the calculated mobility of 1d v - vi - vii compounds are summarized in table  [ t2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the electron mobilities of these 1d materials at 300 k are much higher than the hole mobilities . </S>",
    "<S> the good electron mobilities , 25.69 @xmath4/vs in sbsei , 54.55 @xmath4/vs in sbsi and 96.68 @xmath4/vs in sbsbr respectively , indicate their high performance in microelectronic devices .    for optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices , </S>",
    "<S> indirect band gap semiconductors often suffer from poor efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> however , the difference between direct and indirect band gaps of 1d sbsei is around 0.02 ev . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , similar to bulk sbsei @xcite , 1d sbsei may combine the benefits of direct and indirect band gap materials : the optical absorption remains strong because of the small energy separation between different band edges ; while electron - hole recombination is suppressed , since carriers can be thermalized to basins of different electron momentum . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , by applying a small tensile strain of 3% , 1d sbsei undergoes an indirect - to - direct band gap transition ( for details , see figure  s4 in the supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , 1d materials can tolerate relatively large deformations @xcite , and this direct band gap persists under larger tensile strain , which implies that these 1d materials are promising in optoelectronic devices and mechanical sensors .     of 1d sbsei at 300 k. ]    furthermore , with decreasing dimensionality to 1d , the thermoelectric efficiency can be improved dramatically , since the electrons are confined in a single dimension , and the phonons are easily scattered by the boundary @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ 3](a ) shows the calculated seebeck coefficient of 1d and bulk sbsei , where a negative @xmath5 means p - type doping , while a positive @xmath5 means n - type doping . </S>",
    "<S> the seebeck coefficient @xmath6 of 1d sbsei is much larger than that of bulk sbsei , indicating higher thermoelectric performance . </S>",
    "<S> typically , @xmath6 is large at the edge of heavy band @xcite , and 1d sbsei possesses larger effective mass due to quantum confinement , thus the @xmath6 increases significantly . </S>",
    "<S> even bulk sbsei has an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity along the @xmath3 direction at 300 k , as shown in table  s2 in the supporting information . </S>",
    "<S> thereafter we only calculate the electronic figure of merit , which quantifies the electron - limited thermoelectric efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ 3](b ) presents the calculated thermoelectric figure of merit @xmath7 for 1d and bulk sbsei at 300 k using semiclassical boltzmann transport theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> high thermoelectric performance of 1d sbsei is observed in a wider doping range than bulk sbsei . </S>",
    "<S> considering the enhanced electrical transport and suppressed phonon transport in 1d nanostructures , the thermoelectric performance of 1d sbsei can reach its maximum electron limited @xmath7 more easily than its bulk counterpart .    </S>",
    "<S> although these materials exhibit novel properties for various applications , their experimental feasibility has yet to be confirmed . to examine the feasibility of isolation of the 1d chain , </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the cleavage energy of sbsei . </S>",
    "<S> the ideal cleavage energy of 0.52@xmath8 j / m is much lower than that of graphite @xcite , indicating that the isolation is experimentally attainable . besides the exfoliation of bulk v - vi - vii crystals , </S>",
    "<S> the synthesis of 1d v - vi - vii materials by hydrothermal method or sonochemical method may be experimentally feasible as well , note that their nanowires with diameters of 10 - 50 nm and lengths up to several micrometers have been synthesized using these methods @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we predict the raman frequencies for bulk and 1d v - vi - vii compounds in table  s3 in the supporting information as a reference for characterization .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we predict for the first time three novel 1d materials , sbsei , sbsi and sbsbr . </S>",
    "<S> both the dynamical stability and the thermal stability of these atomically sharp materials are confirmed . during the bulk - to-1d transition , an abrupt change in band gap , effective mass and static </S>",
    "<S> dielectric constant due to quantum confinement makes 1d sbsei highly desirable in next - generation field - effect transistors . </S>",
    "<S> a good electron mobility is also observed in these 1d v - vi - vii compounds . furthermore , </S>",
    "<S> 1d sbsei experiences an indirect - to - direct band gap transition under a small tensile strain of 3% , indicating promising applications in optoelectronic devices and mechanical sensors . </S>",
    "<S> a significant increase in thermoelectric performance can be expected in 1d nanostructures as well . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , the syntheses of these materials by exfoliation , hydrothermal method and sonochemical method can be experimentally feasible . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the fabrication of these novel materials in the laboratory will be accomplished in the near future .      </S>",
