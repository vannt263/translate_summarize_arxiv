    "it is well known that the large quantum corrections to the higgs mass present in standard model do not fit with its small observed value ( and the related small value of the electroweak scale ) . if one wants to avoid a  fine - tuned cancellation an extension of the sm must be used .",
    "traditional solutions like supersymmetry or extra dimensions predict new physics visible at energies close to the electroweak scale . however , prolonged absence of new effects in experiments forces one to look for models that maintain naturalness and produce a  hierarchy of scales at the same time .",
    "lack of new physics in the recent lhc results makes the need for such models more pressing than ever  @xcite .",
    "a recent attempt at obtaining a  scale hierarchy with technically natural parameters is the dynamical relaxation . in this scenario",
    "the electroweak scale is selected through a  dynamical process guided by an interaction of the higgs doublet with new scalar fields .",
    "as those fields are very weakly interacting , they can easily avoid detection . at the same time",
    "the mechanism allows for pushing the new physics scale as far as @xmath0{gev}$ ]  @xcite .",
    "the first part of this note describes the computation of the precise value of the electroweak scale in two basic variants of the relaxation scenario .",
    "the first one is the original idea of the relaxation , that requires only one additional scalar field .",
    "although it was shown to be challenged by observational data , it still serves as an useful introduction and clearly explains the fundamental concept .",
    "the second model is an extension of the first , with one more field required , which leads to the so called double - scanner mechanism .",
    "the cosmological evolution predicted by the double - scanning mechanism is explained step - by - step , with the prime result being an explicit formula for the final electroweak scale in terms of the parameters present in the lagrangian .",
    "the second part deals with possible extensions of the double - scanning to a  model with two higgs doublets .",
    "a  general construction is presented and the final electroweak scale is calculated in a  special case that allows for explicit analytical solution .",
    "it is shown that naturally the double - scanning mechanism can keep at most one of the vevs small .",
    "the simplest relaxion based model , first presented in @xcite , supplements the standard model with axion - like field @xmath1 , termed relaxion in this context .",
    "contrary to the usual qcd axion this field is required to have a  large , non - compact range .",
    "additionally a  soft symmetry - breaking coupling to higgs is introduced .",
    "together , this produces a  dynamical mechanism , which naturally results in a  hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the model s cutoff .",
    "the full potential relevant for the process is given by @xmath2 where @xmath1 is the relaxion , @xmath3 is the higgs doublet , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are small coupling constants , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 are respectively a  model s cutoff , an energy scale at which the cosine term originates and the electroweak scale . the remaining constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 are @xmath11 parameters .",
    "it will become clear in the following part that the exact cosine form is not essential for the model to work , and a  wider class of functions could in principle be allowed here , provided that they produce appropriate extrema .",
    "the potential satisfies naturalness criteria , namely its parameters are @xmath11 and there is no forced hierarchy between them .",
    "the small coupling constant @xmath4 softly breaks the usual discrete shift symmetry @xmath12 of an axion , which would make @xmath1 a  pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson .",
    "this symmetry is recovered in the limit of @xmath13 .",
    "one could ask about a  situation in which the shift symmetry breaking in the higgs mass term is characterized by a  small coupling constant @xmath14 different than @xmath4 . as explained in @xcite in a  situation where @xmath15 quantum corrections from higgs loops would drive @xmath4  to a  value comparable with @xmath14 anyway . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath16 , then the natural excursion range would increase to @xmath17 .",
    "for an analysis of dynamical relaxation it is then sufficient to consider cases in which @xmath18 , a  class of solutions which requires the smallest excursion ranges .",
    "the model requires no special choice of initial conditions , other than @xmath1 being large enough to keep higgs mass - squared positive .",
    "initially therefore the higgs vev @xmath8 is zero and the electroweak symmetry is unbroken . as described in detail in @xcite one can derive an estimate ( up to a  chosen minimum ) of the final electroweak scale @xmath19{\\frac{g \\lambda^3 f}{\\epsilon \\lambda_c^4 } } \\text{.}\\ ] ]      the double - scanner mechanism , presented in @xcite , extends the lagrangian by adding a  second field @xmath20 .",
    "the idea is that during the evolution higgs mass - squared will track @xmath1 , while @xmath1 will track @xmath20 .",
    "the potential , up to terms linear in @xmath1 and @xmath20 , is given by    @xmath21    where @xmath22    @xmath4 , @xmath23 , @xmath5 are small coupling constants and @xmath9 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 are @xmath11 parameters .",
    "it is assumed that all terms are generated at a  cutoff scale @xmath6 .     and @xmath20 .",

    "it is therefore immediately visible , that the band is described by a  simple linear function , with a  width proportional to the cosine s period  @xmath35 .",

    "such a  tuning can be achieved by postulating additional symmetries between the relaxed scalars . for an example of such approach see  @xcite , where a  global su(2 ) symmetry of @xmath121 was proposed .",
    "such symmetry forces both doublets to have the same quartic couplings and hence provides an exact cancellation of alphas .    as a  special case",
    "one can consider a  situation in which doublets are independent , meaning that there is no @xmath122 term in the potential .",
    "this amounts to setting the coupling @xmath123 to zero , which gives vevs of a  form :    @xmath124    it is then possible to state a  simple relationship between vevs , namely : @xmath125 which shows that at least one vev will be of the order of the cutoff .",
    "the dynamical relaxation provides an interesting solution to the hierarchy problem in face of the missing signatures of any new physics in recent experiments . through a  dynamical process taking place in the inflatory phase of the universe it manages to achieve a  small electroweak scale without introducing new states observable in  current experiments . as such it gives a  way out to keep naturalness and remain in agreement with experimental data .",
    "appropriate approximations made it possible to derive an explicit formula for the final higgs vev in the double - scanning scenario .",
    "it confirms the earlier result that the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the model s cutoff originates from the smallness of a  coupling constant softly - breaking the relaxion s shift symmetry .",
    "moreover it is interesting to find that the chosen scale is independent of some of the parameters present in the lagrangian , effectively allowing them to take any value without affecting the observational picture .    the analysis of the relaxation in 2hdm indicates , that in a  general case it is impossible to keep vevs of both scalars small , unless fine - tuning is present or additional symmetries are cast upon the lagrangian . within the slightly constrained variant of 2hdm , where odd powers of the fields expectation values are not present ( which can be easily enforced by requiring that the doublets have different gauge transformations or by imposing a global symmetry ) it can be shown explicitly that the the difference between the vevs of two scalars tends to be proportional to the cutoff .",
    "it is important to point out that although dynamical relaxation is considered as a  mechanism for the selection of the electroweak scale , the whole mechanism is more general and can in principle be used to drive evolution of a  vev of any scalar field .",
    "in particular lagrangians used here depend eventually only on the modulus of the higgs doublet expectation value , which allows to exchange it for a  singlet without any change in the final formulae derived .",

    "<S> the dynamical relaxation provides an interesting solution to the hierarchy problem in face of the missing signatures of any new physics in recent experiments . through a  dynamical process taking place in the inflationary phase of the universe it manages to achieve a  small electroweak scale without introducing new states observable in  current experiments . </S>",
    "<S> appropriate approximation makes it possible to derive an explicit formula for the final vevs in the double - scanning scenario extended to the two higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> analysis of the relaxation in 2hdm indicates , that in a  general case it is impossible to keep vevs of both scalars small , unless fine - tuning is present or additional symmetries are cast upon the lagrangian . within the slightly constrained variant of 2hdm , where odd powers of the fields expectation values are not present ( which can be easily enforced by requiring that the doublets have different gauge transformations or by imposing a global symmetry ) it is shown that the the difference between the vevs of two scalars tends to be proportional to the cutoff . </S>"
