    "after their construction of the domain wall ground state , lots of interesting properties of the solution have been discovered . here , we focus only on one - dimensional models and remark several interesting results .",

    "we see that the domain wall ground state in our electron model has the same degeneracy as that in the xxz model and the same localization property in a certain parameter regime . as in the xxz model ,",

    "to calculate the ground state expectation values of observables , we introduce a normalization function of the ground state .",
    "in particular in the one - dimensional model , we derive a recursion relation for the normalization function , which determines this function together with its boundary data .",
    "this recursion relation is a linear equation in the unknown function of a site with a function coefficient which depends on the distance from the domain wall center .",
    "this method is similar to the method for the normalization function in the non - product domain wall ground states in the xxz model obtained by bolina , contucci and nachtergaele @xcite .",
    "we treat this recursion relation by a kind of perturbative expansion method in the function coefficient .",
    "this treatment of the recursion relation enables us to discuss the convergence of the ground state expectation values of local observables in the infinite - volume limit .",
