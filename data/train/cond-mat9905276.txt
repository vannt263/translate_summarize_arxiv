    "it is often stated in the literature that the superconducting order parameter in a ginzburg - landau ( gl ) model has no physical meaning because it is a non - gauge invariant quantity .",
    "this statement is obvious if by order parameter we mean @xmath3 , the expectation value of the complex scalar field in the gl model . since physical quantities",
    "should be gauge invariant , @xmath3 can not be considered as a physical quantity .",
    "it is desirable , however , to have a gauge invariant definition of order parameter which characterizes the superconducting phase transition .",
    "one such definition exists already and has been proposed by kennedy and king @xcite in the context of the lattice superconductor .",
    "the order parameter proposed by them is given by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a lattice field .",
    "this order parameter describes a phase transition in the lattice gl model .",
    "however , it is not clear that this phase transition coincides exactly with the normal - superconducting transition or , in the language of particle physics , the higgs transition .    in this paper",
    "we will discuss the physical meaning of the superconducting order parameter in the context of a continuum gl model .",
    "the aim of this paper is to discuss in a deeper way the questions addressed by one of us in a recent letter @xcite .",
    "it will be shown that a gauge invariant definition of order parameter , consistent with the traditional definition of the critical exponent @xmath0 , is in fact possible .",
    "less obvious is the gauge independence of @xmath0 in different schemes of renormalization .",
    "for instance , the gauge dependence obtained through dimensional continuation , the @xmath2-expansion , is very different from the one obtained using a fixed dimension approach .",
    "this approach , though less controlled , gives better values to the critical exponents .",
    "in fact , the renomalization group ( rg ) calculations based on the @xmath2-expansion does not give very good results for the superconducting phase transition , specially in what concerns the type ii regime .",
    "indeed , this regime is not readily accessible by the @xmath2-expansion which predicts a weak first order transition whatever the value of the ginzburg parameter @xmath6 @xcite . as shown by dasgupta and halperin @xcite using duality arguments in a lattice model",
    ", the weak first order scenario does not hold in the type ii regime where the transition should be expected to be second order . in order to describe correctly the critical behavior of superconductors using the @xmath2-expansion",
    ", it is necessary to use resummations techniques such as the pad - borel resummation used by folk and holovatch @xcite .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section ii we will discuss the rg equations for the gl model and define the order parameter . in section iii",
    "we will use the ward - takahashi ( wt ) identities to establish the gauge dependence of the order parameter exactly .",
    "it will be shown that in a fixed dimension @xmath1 rg only the landau gauge @xmath7 has a physical meaning .",
    "this result will be anticipated already in section ii by looking the 1-loop approximation to the rg functions .",
    "however , it will only be proved in section iii to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "section iv concludes the paper .",
    "let us consider the following bare action for the gl model :    @xmath8+s_{gf},\\ ] ]    where the zeroes denote bare quantities , @xmath9 is a short for @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 is the gauge fixing part and is given by    @xmath13    we have added a mass to the gauge field in order to regularize the infrared divergences arising from the gauge field propagator .",
    "this mass breaks explicitly the gauge invariance ( also broken by @xmath12 ) , which is recovered at the critical point . adding a mass to the gauge field",
    "does not affect the renormalizability of the model .",
    "this should be contrasted with the non - abelian case , where the only way to provide a mass to the gauge field without destroying renormalizability is through the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "the renormalized action is obtained from the bare action by rewriting it in terms of renormalized quantities .",
    "this is achieved through the introduction of renormalization constants .",
    "we introduce the field renormalization in a standard way @xcite , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . the renormalized action including the other renormalization constants is given by    @xmath16 and @xmath17 above are in fact superflous .",
    "indeed , we have that @xmath18 which means that the corresponding terms in the action , the gauge field mass term and the gauge fixing term , are not renormalized . this result",
    "is easily checked by studying the wt identities as follows . by adding sources to the corresponding fields we obtain the following wt identity :    @xmath19\\right\\}w(j_{\\mu},j^{\\dag},j)= \\partial_{\\mu}j_{\\mu}(x),\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the generating functional of correlation functions defined by    @xmath22}.\\ ] ]    when the sources are zero @xmath21 gives the partition function .",
    "@xmath23 is the generating functional of the connected correlation functions .",
    "the legendre transform of @xmath24 of @xmath23 is given by    @xmath25    where the functional effective action @xmath26 is the generator of the 1-particle irreducible functions .",
    "it satisfies a wt identity which is the legendre transform of ( [ wt1 ] ) :    @xmath27=0.\\ ] ]    both wt identities ( [ wt1 ] ) and ( [ wt2 ] ) are linear .",
    "thus , if we perform a loop expansion , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the @xmath30-loop correction to the effective action , it follows that each @xmath29 satisfy separately a wt identity ( [ wt2 ] ) .",
    "the zero - loop contribution @xmath31 is the classical action @xmath32 , which satisfies the inhomogeneous wt identity ( [ wt2 ] ) , that is , the identity containing the term @xmath33 .",
    "the loop corrections , on the other hand , satisfy the homogeneous wt identity .",
    "the non - gauge invariant terms are all included in the inhomogeous wt identity , do not receive any correction due to the fluctuations and are in this way not renormalized , that is , the coresponding counterterms are zero",
    ". the only non - gauge invariant terms in the action are the gauge field mass term and the gauge fixing term . as a consequence of these reasonings",
    "we obtain that @xmath18 .",
    "this implies that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . from ( [ raction ] )",
    "we deduce also @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it is useful at this point to fix the renormalization conditions necessary to define the corresponding renormalized quantities :    @xmath39    @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    where the latin indices represent the components of the scalar field .",
    "we are interested in the behavior when @xmath45 , the infrared behavior .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath46 , @xmath47 being the reduced temperature , and @xmath48 as @xmath49 , @xmath50 being the correlation lenght .",
    "the rg equations will be obtained by differentiating with respect to @xmath51 with all bare quantities fixed , except for @xmath52 .",
    "let us define the dimensionless couplings @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . the following _ exact _ flow equations are readily obtained :    @xmath56    where we have introduced the rg function @xmath57 which at the fixed point gives the anomalous dimension of the gauge field .",
    "it is defined by    @xmath58    at 1-loop order and in fixed dimension @xmath1 we obtain    @xmath59    from eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) we obtain that a charged fixed point should correspond to @xmath60 . in @xmath61",
    "this corresponds necessarily to zero charge while in @xmath1 we have @xmath62 , a non - zero charge .",
    "the only fixed point to eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) corresponding to a charged fixed point in @xmath1 is @xmath63 , that is , the landau gauge . due to the negative sign in ( [ a ] )",
    ", any @xmath64 in the flow diagram will flow to infinity .",
    "1 shows the flow diagram in the @xmath65-plane in the 1-loop approximation in @xmath1 .",
    "note that the line @xmath7 contains an attractive flow towards the fixed point @xmath62 .",
    "any @xmath64 , no matter how small , will flow away .",
    "this does not happen at @xmath61 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 arbitrary is a line of fixed points .",
    "this 1-loop calculation suggests that in @xmath1 the landau gauge is the only physical gauge .",
    "the 1-loop beta function for the coupling @xmath68 is given by    @xmath69    this beta function does not exhibit any gauge dependence , which is cancelled out between the @xmath70 and @xmath71 term . in ( [ betau ] )",
    "@xmath72 is defined as @xmath73 , which computed in the landau gauge gives    @xmath74    we will see in section iii that the gauge independence of @xmath75 is valid to all orders , though @xmath76 does depend on the gauge .",
    "the flow equations we have obtained are similar to the ones obtained by herbut @xcite in the context of the continuum dual gl model @xcite .",
    "the difference is that in our case the charge @xmath77 is not meant to be the dual charge and , as a consequence , our mass @xmath78 has nothing to do with the photon mass ( anyway , this is a subtle point , even in the dual approach ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    let us discuss the critical behavior that arises from the so defined gl model",
    ". from an experimental point of view , presently only the exponents @xmath79 ( specific heat ) and @xmath80 ( correlation lenght ) are accessible .",
    "the order parameter exponent @xmath0 seems not to be directly accessible .",
    "this is the main point we would like to discuss . at this point ,",
    "an important remark is in order .",
    "the critical exponents are obtained from the singular behavior of the effective action ( the free energy ) and correlation functions .",
    "the wt identities imply that the singular behavior is the same , whatever @xmath81 ( the broken symmetry regime or ordered phase ) or @xmath82 ( symmetric regime or disordered phase ) .",
    "this means that the exponents have the same value below or above @xmath83 .",
    "this remark is very important concerning the superconductors .",
    "the point is that below the transition the photon becomes massive , phenomenon known in particle physics as the higgs mechanism @xcite .",
    "this mass is generated spontaneously and not added by hand as our mass @xmath78 .",
    "since the singular behavior is the same as in the symmetric phase , the renormalization proceeds exactly as in the symmetric phase .",
    "thus , this mechanism is very important in the context of non - abelian gauge theories , where adding a mass by hand destroys renormalizability .",
    "the photon mass generated by the higgs mechanism in the gl model corresponds to the inverse of the penetration depth @xmath84 .",
    "this lenght is known to scales as the correlation lenght @xmath50 @xcite , that is , @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath84 is a quantity that arises only for @xmath81 but its exponent , being the same appearing in the scaling of @xmath50 , can be evaluated for @xmath82 or even for @xmath86 ( the critical point ) , this last case needing renormalization conditions different from the ones we use here due to the infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "the @xmath80 exponent is obtained easily by considering the flow of @xmath52 ( remember that @xmath87 is not kept fixed under rg ) . from the definition of its renormalized counterpart @xmath36",
    ", we obtain    @xmath88    where    @xmath89    eq . ( [ m0 ] ) implies that near the phase transition ( @xmath45 ) @xmath90 , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the fixed point values of @xmath93 and @xmath72 , respectively .",
    "since by definition @xmath46 and @xmath94 we obtain immediately    @xmath95    the @xmath80 exponent can be accurately measured through a direct measurement of the penetration depth @xcite . in the accessible critical region ,",
    "the fluctuations are governed by the 3d xy fixed point @xcite , which is a neutral fixed point .",
    "then , it results that @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the superfluid density @xcite and we have defined the exponent @xmath98 of the penetration depth . using the josephson relation @xmath99 @xcite for the @xmath1 , we obtain @xmath100 .",
    "the exponent @xmath98 obtained experimentally in bulk samples of @xmath101 is @xmath102 @xcite and therefore we obtain @xmath103 , corresponding in this way to a 3d xy universality class .",
    "this very same value of @xmath80 is expected for the charged transition , the so called `` inverted '' 3d xy universality class @xcite . in fact , this is confirmed by recent rg calculations @xcite and montecarlo simulations @xcite .",
    "let us evaluate @xmath80 from eq .",
    "( [ nu ] ) in the present framework .",
    "we have at 1-loop order that    @xmath104    the infrared stable fixed point corresponds to @xmath62 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "this gives @xmath107 and @xmath108 at 1-loop order .",
    "this result can be systematically improved .",
    "indeed , the fixed point @xmath109 will always have a 3d xy value because every power of @xmath110 will be multiplied by a function of @xmath111 which goes to zero as @xmath45 , since @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , we obtain already at 2-loops @xmath103 . it should be noted that this behavior is obtained because from eq .",
    "( [ m ] ) we have that @xmath113 near the phase transition . for @xmath1",
    "this means @xmath114 .",
    "note that this is exactly the scaling behavior of the true photon mass near the neutral 3d xy fixed point !",
    "this means that @xmath78 can be alternatively regarded as a photon mass describing the crossover regime observed experimentally .",
    "this is the case if we interpret the gl model given in ( [ action ] ) as a disorder field theory , that is , as a continuum dual gl model @xcite . in this case , the charge @xmath77 should be replaced by @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is a the dual charge satisfying the dirac condition @xmath117 .",
    "let us investigate now how the exponent @xmath0 should be defined .",
    "this presupposes a definition of order parameter whose scaling has exponent @xmath0 .",
    "this order parameter arises naturally from the definition of the superfluid density @xmath97 .",
    "this is defined for @xmath81 by    @xmath118    we define the order parameter by @xmath119 by    @xmath120    the expectation value of a gauge invariant operator is gauge independent @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath97 should be independent of @xmath121 .",
    "however , @xmath76 is gauge dependent ( see section iii ) and we have that @xmath119 should in fact depends on @xmath121 to cancels the gauge dependence coming from @xmath122 in ( [ rho ] ) , otherwise @xmath97 would be gauge dependent . note that the gauge invariance of @xmath123 implies that @xmath119 is independent of @xmath124 but _ not _ necessarilly independent of @xmath121 .",
    "however , its scaling behavior near the phase transition will be shown ( section iii ) to be gauge independent or , more precisely , to be evaluated in the landau gauge .",
    "the same will shown to be true for @xmath76 . for the moment , let us check that the above definition of order parameter works .",
    "the exponent @xmath0 is defined through its behavior near the critical point , @xmath125 .",
    "also , we have @xmath126 . putting all of this together we obtain @xmath127 , which is the josephson relation as obtained originally in josephson s paper @xcite .",
    "using the hyperscaling relation @xmath128 together with the combination of the scaling relations @xmath129 and @xmath130 to eliminate @xmath131 , we obtain the josephson relation in the form @xmath132 .",
    "this last form of the josephson relation has been also obtained directly by us @xcite , without using the scaling relations @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath133    thus , a gauge dependence in @xmath92 would imply a gauge dependence in @xmath0 if @xmath80 is gauge independent .",
    "note that the gauge independence of @xmath97 does not ensure the gauge independence of @xmath80 .",
    "the point is that the gauge independence of @xmath134 can be a result of compensating gauge dependences arising from @xmath135 ( equivalently , @xmath52 ) and @xmath80 .",
    "in the preceding section we discussed the critical behavior of the gl model while trying to get some insight on the effect of the gauge dependence . clearly a more careful analysis is needed . in this section gauge dependence always means a dependence on @xmath121 , the renormalized gauge fixing parameter .",
    "therefore , the other renormalized parameters of the model are trivially gauge independent .",
    "this statement implies the gauge independence of all beta functions .",
    "note that this does not means necessarilly that the bare parameters are gauge independent .    in order to obtain the gauge dependence of @xmath76 we will employ the wt identities . from the wt identity eq .",
    "( [ wt1 ] ) we obtain the following identity :    @xmath136.\\ ] ]    by using twice eq .",

    "we have that    @xmath142    where @xmath143 is the bare 2-point connected correlation function .",
    "( [ wt3 ] ) is valid also if we replace the renormalized correlation functions by the bare ones and the renormalized couplings by their bare counterparts . using then a bare version of ( [ wt3 ] ) and eq . ( [ eqaux2 ] )",
    ", we obtain    @xmath144    eq .",
    "( [ eqcentral ] ) can be rewritten as    @xmath145    out of which we obtain    @xmath146    where @xmath147 .",
    "note that we have a pole for @xmath61 in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ gdepz ] ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the logarithmic divergence for @xmath61 . in the @xmath2-expansion",
    "the singular part of the different correlation functions is isolated as poles in @xmath148 with @xmath149 and the renormalization constants are written as power series in @xmath148 .",
    "this way of doing the things leads to the determination of the critical exponents as power series in @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the physical case of interest in critical phenomena of superfluid and magnetic systems corresponds to @xmath150 .    by integrating the first line of ( [ gdepz ] )",
    "we obtain    @xmath151    since @xmath152 and @xmath153 , we can rewrite eq .",
    "( [ gdepz1 ] ) as    @xmath154    let us assume that @xmath155 has been evaluated as a power series in @xmath148 .",
    "after regularizing dimensionally the integral in ( [ gdepz2 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath156    which gives the gauge dependence of @xmath72 in the framework of the @xmath2-expansion .",
    "let us assume that an infrared stable fixed point has been obtained , for instance , by ressummation methods @xcite .",
    "as @xmath45 , @xmath157 ( if @xmath150 ) , but @xmath121 scales as @xmath158 near the fixed point and any non - zero @xmath121 runs away as @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the only safe way towards the charged fixed point is over the line @xmath7 , that is , the landau gauge .",
    "note that for the case of interest in particle physics , @xmath61 , we obtain the same equation as ( [ gdepeta ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath61 any gauge choice is possible since @xmath66 in this case .    in the fixed dimension approach things",
    "work differently .",
    "for @xmath1 the integral in eq .",
    "( [ gdepz2 ] ) is convergent and we can interchange the differentiation with respect to m with the integral sign .",
    "since @xmath159 and @xmath160 are both rg invariants , we obtain    @xmath161    and we obtain again that the physical gauge corresponds to @xmath7 . at this point",
    "some remarks are in order .",
    "first , from eq .",
    "( [ gdepeta1 ] ) we obtain @xmath162 while the same is not true for the @xmath163 given in eq .",
    "( [ gdepeta ] ) .",
    "second , eq .",
    "( [ gdepeta1 ] ) can be easily checked at 1-loop order .",
    "the renormalization constant is given as a function of @xmath110 , @xmath121 and @xmath111 and if we take care of differentiating @xmath121 when obtaining @xmath72 , the result ( [ gdepeta1 ] ) follows and coincides with eq .",
    "( [ etaphi ] ) . concerning the 1-loop example , it is instructive to ask ourselves what happens in other fixed dimension approaches .",
    "for instance , we could perform a critical point ( @xmath164 ) calculation where the renormalization conditions are defined at non - zero external momenta , taking the symmetrical point for functions which depend on more than one momentum variable @xcite . in this case",
    "the photon mass @xmath78 is unecessary since the non - zero external momenta take care of infrared divergences @xcite .",
    "the 1-loop expression for @xmath76 in an arbitrary gauge is in this case rather simple and has been calculated by schakel @xcite .",
    "it turns out in this case that @xmath76 is independent of @xmath121 if @xmath1 .",
    "the gauge dependence of @xmath165 can be obtained in an analogous way . from the renormalization condition ( [ rcm ] ) and",
    "@xmath166 , we obtain that @xmath167 .",
    "using again the bare version of ( [ wt3 ] ) , we obtain exactly the same equation as eq .",
    "( [ gdepz ] ) but with @xmath76 replaced by @xmath165 .",
    "this means that the gauge dependence of @xmath165 is the same as for @xmath76 .",
    "if we use the @xmath2-expansion we have that @xmath168 is gauge independent since the gauge dependence of @xmath93 will cancel exactly the gauge dependence of @xmath72 . in fixed dimension @xmath1 , on the other hand , @xmath169 .",
    "it follows that the critical exponent @xmath80 is gauge independent .",
    "since @xmath92 is gauge independent , it follows that @xmath0 is gauge independent and the order parameter @xmath119 has a true physical meaning .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the critical exponent @xmath0 of the superconducting order parameter is gauge independent or , stating more correctly , that it must be evaluated in the landau gauge @xmath7 .",
    "we may wonder if it is not a wasting of time to prove a result about something unaccessible experimentally .",
    "the point is that it is not sure that @xmath119 can not be measured and we hope that the discussion in this paper could stimulate some experimental effort in this sense .",
    "moreover , we have shown that transversality ( the landau gauge ) is an intrinsic physical feature of the @xmath1 gl model , a property not shared by the @xmath61 model . in @xmath61 ( the case of interest in particle physics )",
