    "the khz qpos may still reflect the orbital ( quasi - keplerian ) frequency at a radius far from the inner edge of the disc . a possible scenario to reconcile this idea , for instance ,",
    "could be a mechanism that amplifies the orbital frequencies of matter orbiting within a narrow ring in the disc to produce the qpo .",
    "the process could be similar to the lamp - post model by @xcite .",
    "such mechanism , however , must be able to pick a narrow range of radii in order to reproduce the observed high qpo coherence values ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for instance , for a 1.8 solar mass neutron star with a qpo at 800 hz , if this is the keplerian frequency in the disc , the putative mechanism should pick a ring of @xmath1600 m to produce a qpo with @xmath63 . besides generating the khz qpos , this mechanism should also affect other properties of the disc , such as the emissivity index or the ionisation balance , which would in turn affect the properties of the iron emission line .    from the behaviour of the time derivative of the frequency of the lower khz qpo",
    ", @xcite found that the khz qpos ( both the lower and the upper ) in 4u 163653 are consistent with the orbital frequency at the sonic radius in the accretion disc .",
    "we also note that the frequency of the upper khz qpo increases monotonically across the colour - colour diagram .",
    "all this lends support to the interpretation of the khz qpo reflecting the orbital frequency at the inner edge of the accretion disc .",

    "\\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{figure16.ps } & \\includegraphics[scale=0.23]{figure17.ps}\\\\ \\end{array}$ ]    besides doppler and relativistic effects , the iron emission line can be broadened by other processes .",
    "for example , the broadening may be ( partially ) due to compton scattering in a disc corona ( @xcite ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite showed that compton broadening alone can not explain the broad profile of the iron emission line in 4u 163653 .",
    "@xcite argued that the red wing of the fe - k@xmath0 lines is not due to doppler / relativistic effects , but to relativistic , optically - thick , wide - angle ( or quasi - spherical ) outflows ( @xcite ; @xcite , see however @xcite ; @xcite , and @xcite ) .",
    "as explained by @xcite , in this scenario the red wing of the iron line is formed in a strong extended wind illuminated by the radiation emanating from the innermost part of the accreting material .",
    "one of the main predictions of this model is that all high - frequency variability should be strongly suppressed .",
    "the fact that we detected khz qpos and broad iron lines simultaneously in 4u  163653 casts doubt on this interpretation .",
    "although our findings contradict this scenario , the model under discussion has been developed for black holes , so it is not clear how the boundary layer or the neutron star surface could change these predictions .",
    "compared to other sources , the iron line in 4u 163653 shows unusual properties ; for instance , the best - fitting inclination is @xmath65 @xcite , which is at odds with the lack of dips or eclipse in the light curve .",
    "@xcite proposed that the line profile could be the blend of two ( or more ) lines , for example , formed at different radii in the disc , or due to separate regions with different ionisation balance .",
    "if this is correct , the total line profile would be the result of iron lines at different energies . to proceed further with this idea",
    "would require to solve the ionisation balance in the accretion disc where the line is formed .",
    "@xcite investigated this scenario by fitting the reflection spectrum with a self - consistent ionised reflection model , but they did not find any supporting evidence for this idea ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the fact that in obs .  3 and 5 the khz qpo frequency significantly varied within the 20 - 30  ksec required to detect the iron line suggests that the iron line profile we model may be affected by changes of the disc during those 20 - 30  ksec .",
    "if the khz qpo frequency depends upon the inner disc radius , the iron line profile we observe would be the average of different line profiles , one for each value of the inner disc radius .",
    "this is independent of whether the khz qpo frequency reflects the orbital disc frequency , or whether the relation between frequency and inner radius is more complicated .",
    "the line energy or the disc emissivity could also vary if the inner disc radius changes . to proceed further , detailed simulations ( assuming scenarios in which only the @xmath8 changes with time , as well as scenarios in which all line parameters change ) are needed to test to what extent changes in the accretion flow on timescales of @xmath130  ksec ( approximately the time needed with present instruments to fit the line accurately ) can affect the final line profile .",
    "a similar consideration applies to the inner radius inferred from the khz qpo frequency .",
    "as mentioned in section  [ sec : qpo_analysis ] , in obs .  3 and 5",
    "the frequency of the lower khz qpo spanned a frequency range of @xmath1200 hz during the @xmath125 ks observation .",
    "although , we did not directly see the upper khz qpo changing frequency with time , it is likely that the upper khz qpo followed the lower one . if this was the case , then the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the upper khz qpo observed contains information on the frequency range covered by the qpo during the observation . to bring this information into the inner disc radius estimates",
    ", we should use the qpo fwhm instead of the frequency error ( which is relatively small ) to calculate the probability distribution function of the inner radius of the accretion disc . in figure",
    "[ fig : diskline_fwhm ] we show the marginal probability distribution functions of the ns mass inferred from the four observations combining the upper khz qpos and the iron lines modelled with diskline .",
    "solid and dotted lines represent the marginal probability distribution functions using the error in the qpo frequency and the half - width half - maximum ( hwhm ) as error , respectively . in the latter case",
    "the marginal probability distribution functions of the ns mass show a broader profile , and the range of mass values where they are consistent increases ( although the overlapping area is still small ) . by combining the marginal probability distribution functions we get the mass profile ( joint probability ) for which , in the 4 observations , khz qpo and iron line estimates of the inner disc radius are consistent .",
    "this is shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : diskline_fwhm ] .",
    "the most likely value of the ns mass , for this specific case , ranges between @xmath11.1 and @xmath11.5 m@xmath61 , which is consistent with theoretical ns mass predictions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "however , it should be noticed that in figure  [ fig : diskline_fwhm ] , two out of the four pdfs ( obs",
    ".  1 and 2 ) marginally overlap , therefore the final joint probability function is likely not fully representative of all observations . statistically speaking ,",
    "the overlapping area between the intersecting marginal distributions in figure  [ fig : diskline_fwhm ] represents the likelihood of measuring 4 values @xmath66 of the ns mass @xmath67 ( assuming the mass is always the same ) , and the hypothesis @xmath68 that one of the khz qpos is keplerian , the fe line is relativistic , and both phenomena arise from the same region of the accretion disc is valid . in table  [ tab : probability ] we report the the ns mass values and the likelihood for the different models used to fit the fe line profile .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the highest likelihood of the data given the model is obtained when the fe - k@xmath0 emission line is modelled with diskline .",
    "the frequency of the khz qpo and the source intensity ( likely the mass accretion rate ) are degenerate on long ( longer than @xmath1 a day ) time - scales (  parallel tracks ",
    "* ) : the same qpo frequency may appear at very different source intensities .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this phenomenon can affect some properties of the disc , such as the emissivity index or the ionisation balance , which would affect the profile of the iron line , and hence the inferred value of the inner radius of the accretion disc .",
