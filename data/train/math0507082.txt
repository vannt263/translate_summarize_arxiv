    "let us consider a portfolio of @xmath0 loans .",
    "let the notional of loan @xmath1 be equal to @xmath2 .",
    "then the @xmath1th loan represents fraction @xmath3 of the notional of the whole portfolio .",
    "this means that if loan @xmath1 defaults and the entire notional of the loan is lost the portfolio loses fraction @xmath4 or @xmath5 of its value . in practice",
    "when a loan @xmath1 defaults a fraction @xmath6 of its notional will be recovered by the creditors . thus the actual loss given default ( lgd ) of loan @xmath1 is @xmath7 fraction or @xmath8 of the notional of the entire portfolio .",
    "we now describe the gaussian m - factor model of portfolio losses from default .",
    "the model requires a number of input parameters . for each loan",
    "@xmath1 we are give a probability @xmath9 of its default .",
    "also for each @xmath1 and each @xmath10 we are given a number @xmath11 such that @xmath12 .",
    "the number @xmath11 is the loading factor of the loan @xmath1 with respect to factor @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be independent standard normal random variables .",
    "let @xmath16 be the cdf of the standard normal distribution . in our model loan @xmath1 defaults if @xmath17 this indeed happens with probability @xmath9 .",
    "the factors @xmath18 are usually interpreted as the state of the global economy , the state of the regional economy , the state of a particular industry and so on .",
    "thus they are the factors that affect the default behavior of all or at least a large group of loans in the portfolio .",
    "the factors @xmath19 are interpreted as the idiosyncratic risks of the loans in the portfolio .",
    "let @xmath20 be defined by @xmath21 we define the random loss caused by the default of loan @xmath1 as @xmath22 where @xmath6 is the recovery rate of loan @xmath1 .",
    "the total loss of the portfolio is @xmath23    an important property of the gaussian factor model is that the @xmath24 s are not independent of each other .",
    "their mutual dependence is induced by the dependence of each @xmath24 on the common factors @xmath18 .",
    "historical data supports the conclusion that losses due to defaults on different loans are correlated with each other .",
    "historical data can also be used to calibrate the loadings @xmath11.the @xmath24 s are not independent of each other .",
    "their mutual dependence is induced by the dependence of each @xmath24 on the common factors @xmath18 .",
    "historical data supports the conclusion that losses due to defaults on different loans are correlated with each other .",
    "historical data can also be used to calibrate the loadings @xmath11 .",
    "when the values of the factors @xmath18 are fixed , the probability of the default of loan @xmath1 becomes @xmath26    the random losses @xmath24 become conditionally independent bernoulli variables with the mean given by @xmath27 and the variance given by @xmath28    by the central limit theorem @xcite the conditional distribution of the portfolio loss @xmath25 , given the values of the factors @xmath18 , can be approximated by the normal distribution with the mean @xmath29 and the variance    @xmath30    we define the cdf of the unconditional portfolio loss @xmath25 by @xmath31 for all real numbers @xmath32 .",
    "since the conditional loss distribution is approximately normal , the cdf can be approximated by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the cdf of the normal distribution with mean @xmath35 and variance @xmath36 , while @xmath37 is the density of the standard normal distribution .",
    "in this section we apply the proposed algorithm to the single factor gaussian model of a portfolio with @xmath38 names . we choose a 125 name portfolio because it is the size of the standard djcdx.na.ig portfolio .",
    "we choose a single factor model because it is the one most frequently used in practice .",
    "the parameters of the portfolio are @xmath39 where @xmath40 .    in figure [ resultsfig ]",
    "we compare the cdf computed using @xmath41 monte carlo samples with the cdf computed using formula ( [ theformula ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the two is good .",
    "we add that the quality of approximation will improve even further for a bigger portfolio and many bank portfolios have much more than 125 names .",
    "[ resultsfig ]",
    "we define the @xmath42 ( value at risk ) of a given portfolio as the level of loss ( expressed as fraction of portfolio notional ) , such that the probability of the portfolio loss being less or equal to @xmath42 is equal to a predefined confidence level @xmath43 .",
    "typically , @xmath43 is chosen to be between @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus we have @xmath46 from the results of the previous section it follows that an accurate approximation to @xmath42 can be found by solving the equation @xmath47 this equation can be solved , for example , by bisection . to find the solution to ( [ equv ] ) with accuracy of 1 basis point ( 0.01% ) we would need to evaluate the left hand side of ( [ equv ] ) no more than 14 times .",
    "* example . *",
    "_ we want to calculate the @xmath42 of the portfolio ( [ port ] ) with the confidence level @xmath48 .",
    "we solve the equation ( [ equv ] ) and round the solution to the nearest basis point to arrive at @xmath49 .",
    "we now run monte carlo simulation with @xmath50 samples and compute the probability that the portfolio loss is less or equal to @xmath51 . rounded to the nearest basis point it turns out to be @xmath52 .",
    "thus the @xmath42 of the portfolio is indeed @xmath51 .",
    "_    if desired , the convergence can be sped - up by using newton s method .",
    "after the @xmath42 is calculated we can calculate the economic capital by subtracting the average portfolio loss from @xmath42 .",
    "we now compare the algorithm proposed here with other proposed alternatives .",
    "the fft based methods @xcite require the computation of a large number of fourier transforms . to determine the @xmath42 with an error of less than 1 basis point ( 0.01% ) it is necessary to compute approximately 10,000 fourier transforms .",
    "each fourier transform is as expensive to evaluate as the left hand side of ( [ equv ] ) .",
    "thus our algorithm is significantly faster than the fft based methods .",
    "it is well known that the fft methods are much faster than the direct monte carlo simulation .",
    "thus our algorithm is much faster than the monte carlo approach .",
    "finally , the recursive approach of hull - white @xcite is comparable in speed to the algorithm proposed here .",
    "however , it assumes that all the loans in the portfolio have equal notionals and recovery rates .",
    "this is a very restrictive assumption which is unrealistic for many portfolios encountered in practice .",
    "our algorithm makes no assumptions about homogeneity of the portfolio .",
    "additionally , it is easier to implement than the algorithm of hull - white .",
    "since @xmath42 satisfies equation ( [ equv ] ) we can use the implicit function theorem @xcite to find its partial derivatives with respect to the parameters of the model .",
    "these partial derivatives are traditionally called the greeks in finance .",
    "we arrive at the following expressions @xmath53    @xmath54    @xmath55    @xmath56    and @xmath57    these expressions can be easily evaluated by numerical integration using hermite - gauss quadrature .",
    "we proposed an algorithm for computing the @xmath42 and the economic capital of a loan portfolio in the gaussian factor model .",
    "the proposed method was tested on a portfolio of 125 names and gave high accuracy results",
    ". the accuracy will be even higher for portfolios with more names .",
    "many of the bank portfolios are much larger than 125 names .",
    "the proposed algorithm is much faster than the fft based methods @xcite and the brute force monte carlo approach .",
    "the speed of the hull - white algorithm @xcite is comparable to that of the the algorithm proposed here , but the hull - white algorithm requires that all the loans in the portfolio have equal notionals and recovery rates .",
    "this is a very restrictive assumption which is unrealistic for many portfolios encountered in practice .",
    "our algorithm makes no assumptions about the homogeneity of the portfolio .",
    "also , it is easier to implement than the algorithm of hull - white .    additionally , we obtained analytical expressions for the greeks using the implicit function theorem .",
    "we also comment that the algorithm can be extended trivially to the case of stochastic recovery rates and recovery rates correlated with the state of the factor variables .",
