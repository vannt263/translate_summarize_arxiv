    "a substantial amount of experimental effort aims at designing highly structured photonic environments in the vicinity of the emitter to achieve a high level of control over its quantum dynamics @xcite .",
    "much of the earlier work focuses on the resonant coupling to a single confined mode of the photonic structure that has favorable emission properties , while coupling to the rest of the modes of the photonic environment is regarded as a parasitic influence and is either discarded or bulked into a total background spontaneous emission rate in the spirit of ref .",
    "recent trends in experimental work , however , point towards spatially highly complex and open photonic structures , where the delineation between a cavity and the radiative environment becomes highly blurred ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such situations are more effectively described through the local density of photonic states ( ldops ) @xcite .",
    "this more powerful and potent theoretical approach has meanwhile fueled a great deal of research on light - matter interaction in fields ranging from cavity qed to photovoltaics @xcite , giving rise to what may be referred to as  ldops engineering \" .    while recent theoretical works have recognized the potential of this method @xcite including those dealing with dispersing and absorbing media @xcite , the lack of a suitable method which allows tackling the often complex non - markovian dynamics of a two - level - like emitter in a leaky photonic structure was a significant hurdle in revealing novel phenomena that may be at play in a host of modern - day light - confining structures such as periodic @xcite , deterministic aperiodic @xcite , and disordered photonic media @xcite , as well as nanoplasmonic systems @xcite . here",
    "we present a formalism for computing the full quantum dynamics of emitters in arbitrarily complex photonic structures based on a single volterra equation with a spectral function proportional to the ldops .",

    "some of the aspects of these regimes have been discussed before in the literature within the limited scope of a variety of methods @xcite .",

    "if , as in our case , these peaks also have an equidistant spacing to each other , then the interference between these resonant modes produces a train of pulses in the probability of the excited state @xmath81 , corresponding to pulsed revivals of the tls inversion ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig3_evolution ] ) . with the revival time being equal to half the cavity round trip time , the straightforward explanation of this phenomenon is the repetitive emission and subsequent reabsorption of radiation by the tls , when it is back - reflected by the cavity boundaries . as such",
    ", this effect relies on the fact that the phases acquired from all possible paths starting from and returning to the position of the tls differ only by integer multiples of @xmath83 , a condition which strongly depends on the position of the tls in the cavity .",
    "indeed , if we move the tls away from the cavity center , a much more irregular type of dynamics emerges ( not shown ) .",
    "we also checked explicitly on the limitations that the revival effect is subject to in terms of the cavity opening .",
    "for that purpose we performed numerical simulations for cavities with smaller values of the mirror s reflectivity factor @xmath84 . we observe that for decreasing values of @xmath71 the overlap between neighboring resonant peaks in @xmath57 increases until they merge into a single wide resonance . as a result ,",
    "the revivals in the inversion of the tls die out when all resonances merge to a single peak , at which point the decay will be just a simple exponential decay , no matter how large the coupling strength @xmath7 is .",
    "to verify the validity of the above results , we recalculated the temporal decay in all of the three regimes from above using a recently developed system - and - bath approach @xcite . under the rotating - wave and born approximations",
    "this approach can , in principle , also be reduced to a single volterra equation as in eq .",
    "( [ volterra_eq ] ) .",
    "we have , however , been able to go beyond the born approximation by solving a coupled set of volterra equations for the tls and damped cavity modes explicitly numerically .",
    "these equations very well illustrate how costly it becomes numerically to obtain the solutions for the temporal decay without the laplace transform employed above and how little insight one gets into these solutions when they have to be explicitly integrated in time .",

    "<S> we study the non - markovian quantum dynamics of an emitter inside an open multimode cavity , focusing on the case where the emitter is resonant with high - frequency cavity modes . based on a green s function technique suited for open photonic structures , we study the crossovers between three distinct regimes as the coupling strength is gradually increased : ( i ) overdamped decay with a time scale given by the purcell modified decay rate , ( ii ) underdamped oscillations with a time scale given by the effective vacuum rabi frequency , and ( iii ) pulsed revivals . </S>",
    "<S> the final multimode strong coupling regime ( iii ) gives rise to quantum revivals of the atomic inversion on a time scale associated with the cavity round - trip time . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the crucial parameter to capture the crossovers between these regimes is the nonlinear lamb shift , accounted for exactly in our formalism . </S>"
