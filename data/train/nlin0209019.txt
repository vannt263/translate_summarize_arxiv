    "the paper is devoted to a description of the periodic and soliton solutions of some generic classical 3-dimensional discrete integrable model .",
    "we will see that this description can be presented in the completely analogous way as the description of the finite - gap solutions of the hierarchy of the continuous integrable equations , although the way we get the system of equation is unusual and motivated by the approach developed in @xcite for discrete integrable spin models .",
    "first , we construct the discrete equations of motion from an equivalence of the linear systems ( which replace zero - curvature condition for lax operators in usual formulation ) and after that prove the integrability by the counting the independent number of the integrals of motion .",
    "several types of the boundary conditions may be considered on the cubic lattice ( the open boundary , periodical boundary conditions in chosen directions , or the completely periodical boundary conditions ) .",
    "this choice leads to several dynamical interpretation of the model : as a cauchy problem , as a bcklund transformation , or as an analogue of the standing vibrations on the discrete @xmath0 torus .",
    "starting from the discrete equations of motion we introduce a change of variables through triple of the legendre variables , which transforms the equations of motion into the three - linear form .",
    "these three - linear equations appear to be a generalization of the famous hirota bi - linear discrete equation .",
    "then we observe that these three - linear equations can be formally solved with the help of fay s identity for a theta - function on an arbitrary algebraic curve .",
    "some facts observed in this paper are the demonstration of the general statements proved more than two decades ago in @xcite  any discrete integrable system can be solved using the algebraic - geometry methods . in this paper",
    "we develop further an alternative approach to 3-dimensional discrete integrable systems @xcite which does not use the notion of lax operators and can be applied equivalently to quantum ( spin ) or classical integrable systems associated with several 3-dimensional lattices . instead of the lax operators we use the notion of the linear system defined on auxiliary planes . in this paper",
    "we consider the cubic lattice , although these methods may be applied to arbitrary 3-dimensional lattices formed by a set of planes .",

    "but before conclude this section we would like to give one more explanation of the solitons creation procedure .",
    "let us consider the equation at @xmath289 for @xmath387 and homogeneous or zero - soliton @xmath102-functions @xmath388 .",
    "this is a difference with respect to `` space '' coordinates @xmath63 and @xmath64 linear equation for the function @xmath389 . using simple algebra one may verify that besides trivial solution @xmath390 this equation has a solution of the form @xmath391 , where parameter @xmath392 of the function @xmath393 is identified with @xmath394 .",
    "the complete solutions of linear difference equations is @xmath395 with arbitrary @xmath396 , now solving the equation for @xmath397 and @xmath398 with found @xmath399 we can find the values of the @xmath102-functions @xmath400 and @xmath401 at the discrete time @xmath385 .",
    "they will have similar to one - soliton form . using these solutions again in the equation with @xmath387 we will find two - soliton solution for the function @xmath389 and then two - soliton solutions for the functions @xmath400 and @xmath401 at the next value of the discrete time @xmath402 .",
    "it is clear that this procedure can be continued and demonstrate the equivalence of the discrete evolution parameter @xmath62 to the number of solitons .",
    "this simple explanation finally justify that investigated in this paper the discrete dynamic given by the equations of motion  is a set of consecutive bcklund transformations .",
    "as it is well known @xcite , the dynamics of parameters of 3d spin models is equivalent to the dynamics ( [ eq - of - mo1]-[eq - of - mo3 ] ) .",
    "so the classical solutions discussed in this paper can be used for the spin models of different types .",
    "the solutions with periodic boundary conditions can be utilized for construction generic spin model , such that their boltzmann weights are parameterized by the theta - functions of the higher genus .",
    "the integrability of such spin models is based on the modified tetrahedron equation @xcite .",
    "this should include the different generalization of the famous chiral potts model .",
    "on the other hand the solitonic solutions are convenient for completely inhomogeneous zbb model and open a way to develop the quantum separation of variables for zbb model @xcite .",
    "in particular , these solutions with parameters @xmath403 allows one to construct the complete family of isospectral deformations of zbb transfer - matrix ( see also @xcite for realization of this program in case of relativistic toda chain model with spin degrees of freedom ) .",
