    "distributed function computation has been a long studied source coding problem in information theory .",
    "the point - to - point case was investigated in the context of interactive communication by orlitsky and roche @xcite who derived the rate region for one - round and two - round communication using the concept of conditional characteristic graph defined and developed by krner @xcite and witsenhausen @xcite , respectively .",
    "the generalization to @xmath0 round communication was considered by ma and ishwar @xcite .    the first setting with more than one source can be attributed to slepian and wolf who investigated the multiple access configuration where a receiver wants to recover the sources perfectly @xcite .",
    "later , krner and marton considered the specific setting where a receiver wants to compute the sum modulo two of two binary sources and derived the rate region in the specific case where the sources have a symmetric distribution @xcite .",
    "this result has been generalized for sum modulo @xmath1 for an arbitrary prime number @xmath1 in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently , we derived the rate regions for the setting where the function is partially invertible ( and arbitrary distributions ) and the case of independent sources ( and arbitrary functions ) @xcite .    except for these cases ,",
    "the rate region for two sources remains an open problem in general .",
    "for instance , for the sum modulo two and arbitrary distributions , the best known rate region inner bound is the one obtained ahlswede and han @xcite .",
    "building on this work , huang and skoglund derived an achievable rate region for a certain class of polynomial functions which is larger than the slepian - wolf rate region @xcite .",
    "finally , a variation of the problem where the receiver wants to compute some subspace generated by the sources has been investigated by lalitha _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "the cascade network configuration has been considered in the cases where there is no side information at the receiver by cuff _",
    "_ @xcite and where the sources form a markov chain by viswanathan @xcite .",
    "the general case was recently investigated in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : problem ] .",
    "two sources , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , are separately observed by two transmitters , and a receiver wants to compute a function @xmath4 of the sources .",
    "transmitter-@xmath5 first sends some information to transmitter-@xmath6 at rate @xmath7 ( cooperation phase ) , then transmitter-@xmath5 and transmitter-@xmath6 send information to the receiver at rate @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . to transmitter-@xmath3 can be heard by the receiver too .",
    "this problem has been considered in the context of rate distortion problem by kaspi and berger @xcite and in the context of function computation by ericsson and krner @xcite .",
    "] this paper investigates this setting in the context of both function computation and rate distortion .    the first part of the paper is devoted to function computation .",
    "the main result is a general rate region inner bound that is tight in a number of special cases :    * unlimited cooperation , _",
    "i.e. _ , when transmitter-@xmath6 knows @xmath5 ; * the function is partially invertible_i.e .",
    "_ , when @xmath2 is a function of @xmath4 ; * one and two - round point - to - point communication for which we recover the results in @xcite ; * cascade network for which we recover the results of @xcite ; * no cooperation : invertible function and arbitrary function , or , arbitrary function and independent sources for which we recover the results of @xcite .",
    "an interesting illustration of the second case shows that the sum rate per cooperation rate , _",
    "i.e._,@xmath10 , can be arbitrarily large .    in the second part of the paper we consider the problem where the receiver wants to recover some functions @xmath11 and @xmath12 within some distortions .",
    "for the special case where @xmath13 and @xmath14 kaspi and berger @xcite proposed two inner bounds .",
    "the first one is a general inner bound while the second one is valid and tight in the full cooperation case only .",
    "these bounds easily generalize to arbitrary functions by using similar arguments as those used by yamamoto in ( * ? ? ? * proof of theorem  1 ) to extend wyner and ziv s result ( * ? ? ?",
