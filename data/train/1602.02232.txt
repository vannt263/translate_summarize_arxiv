    "those works rely heavily on curvature bounds which is no issue at all in our approach .",
    "similarly as for compact manifolds , the cornerstones of the proofs of the above theorems are the corresponding assertions for euclidean model cases and localizations by means of suitable atlases . in the noncompact setting we can not use finite atlases but have to deal with infinitely many charts .",
    "this requires uniform local estimates and a somewhat elaborate technical machinery .",
    "both of these are developed in the following sections .    to allow for a unified approach by fourier analysis to parabolic and elliptic equations we introduce , in the next section , general weighted spaces on  @xmath189 and closed half - spaces thereof . in section  [ sec - b ]",
    "we collect those of their basic properties which we employ in this paper .    the study of anisotropic function spaces and the fourier analysis therein are considerably facilitated by the use of anisotropic dilations .",
    "the latter are introduced in section  [ sec - a ] and some easy properties are described .",
    "the next section belongs to the heart of the matter .",
    "here we introduce the fourier multiplier theorems from which we derive our results . in the case of anisotropic sobolev spaces we rely on the marcinkiewicz theorem .",

    "to handle these cases , we introduce an anisotropic extension of the fourier multiplier theorem established in  @xcite .",
    "although this extension holds for operator - valued symbols and arbitrary banach spaces , we restrict ourselves to the case of matrix - valued symbols . by combining the fourier multiplier theorem with a lifting property",
    "we arrive at simple criteria for fourier integral operators with ( anisotropically ) homogeneous symbols to realize bounded linear operators between sobolev  slobodeckii , respectively hlder spaces .    as a first application of these fourier multiplier theorems we give , in section  [ sec - h ] , a  very simple proof for the fact that principal part parabolic operators with constant coefficients define isomorphisms between suitable sobolev  slobodeckii and little hlder spaces on .",
    "it is the advantage of our approach that it handles all these spaces by one and the same technique . in particular , in this fourier - analytic approach we can deal with all slobodeckii spaces , including those with integrability index  @xmath190 , as well as with hlder spaces .",
    "this stands in contrast to the earlier work of other authors . in the euclidean",

    "since the bessel potential space results are restricted to with , there is no way to cover the spaces  @xmath191 or hlder spaces by this method .",
    "in addition , interpolation does not lead to optimal regularity conditions for the coefficients .    using an isotropic setting , we give , along the same lines , in section  [ sec - s ] a  simple proof for theorem  [ thm - i.s ] , provided @xmath64  is a principal part operator on  @xmath120 with constant coefficients .",
    "( this result is already contained in  @xcite . ) by combining the findings in sections [ sec - h ] and  [ sec - s ] we prove in the next section theorem  [ thm - i.p ] for the constant coefficient model problem on .    in section  [ sec - l ] we present the precise definition of uniformly regular riemannian manifolds and and prove the basic localization theorem  [ thm - l.n ] .",
    "the next two sections contain the localization machinery by which we can reduce the proof of theorem [ thm - i.p ] and  [ thm - i.s ] to the flat case .",
    "this is done by constructing  a retraction - coretraction pair between our function spaces on  @xmath16 and sequence spaces whose elements take values in the corresponding function spaces on  @xmath120 . here",
    "we rely on our previous work on function spaces on singular manifolds @xcite ,  @xcite .    in the euclidean",
    "setting in section  [ sec - n ] , we use for the first ( and only ) time the fact that in the preparatory sections we have dealt with parameter - dependent spaces and operators .",
    "this is employed to control the lower order terms which , by choosing the parameter sufficiently large , can be considered to be small perturbations of the principal part operators .",
    "thus our use of parameter - dependent spaces is somewhat different from the usual one initiated by m.s .",
