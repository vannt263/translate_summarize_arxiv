    "8.mm    in the past decade , strongly correlated lattice quantum systems have been attracting a lot of interest and effort . remarkably , simple yet nontrivial models which contain most of the important many - body physics and known in the theory community for many years can be now realized and studied experimentally . for the first time",
    "theoretical predictions and experimental data for strongly correlated states can be directly tested against each other in the ideal setup when all model ingredients are known and controlled .",
    "experimentally , lattice systems are realized by trapping atoms in an optical lattice , a periodic array of potential wells resulting from the dipole coupling of the atoms to the electric field of the standing electromagnetic wave produced by a laser .",
    "optical lattices are a very powerful and versatile tool . by changing the laser parameters and configuration ,",
    "the properties and geometry of the optical lattice can be finely tuned @xcite .",
    "ultimately , this results in the possibility of controlling the hamiltonian parameters and exploring various regimes of interest . in particular , ultra - cold bose atoms trapped in an optical lattice are an experimental realization of the bose - hubbard model .",
    "the model has been studied in the seminal paper by fisher , weichman , grinstein , and fisher , ref .  , and",
    "its physical realization with ultra - cold atoms trapped in an optical lattice has been envisioned in ref .",
    "few years later , the bose - hubbard system was produced in the laboratory  @xcite . since then , the field remains very active @xcite , not only because theoretical predictions and experimental techniques still have to be substantially improved to claim the quantitative agreement , but also because of the new physical applications .    at zero temperature ,",
    "a system of bosons with commensurate filling factor undergoes a superfluid - to - mott insulator ( sf - mi ) quantum phase transition .",
    "the ground state of mi can be used in quantum information processing to initialize a large set of qubits ( the main remaining challenge is in addressing single atoms to build quantum gates , see ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "atomic systems in optical lattices have the advantage of being well isolated from the environment .",
    "this results in a relatively long decoherence time of the order of seconds  @xcite and therefore the possibility of building long - lived entangled many body states .",
    "these properties make mi groundstates good candidates for building blocks of a quantum computer .",
    "another possible application is in interferometric measurements @xcite .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that using the superfluid - to - mott - insulator phase transition to entangle and disentangle atomic bose - einstein condensate one can go beyond the heisenberg - limited interferometry .",
    "a system of bosons with short - range repulsive pair interaction trapped in an optical lattice is described by the bose - hubbard hamiltonian : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the bosonic creation and annihilation operators on the site @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the hopping matrix element , @xmath12 is the on - site repulsion and @xmath13 is the sum of the chemical potential @xmath14 and the confining potential @xmath15 . in what follows ,",
    "we consider bosons in the simple cubic lattice . at zero temperature and integer",
    "filling factor , the competition between kinetic energy and on - site repulsion induces the mi - sf transition .",
    "when the on - site repulsion is dominating , @xmath16 the atoms are tightly localized in the mi ground state which is well approximated by the product of local ( on - site ) fock states .",
    "the mott state is characterized by zero compressibility originating from an energy gap for particle and hole excitations . when the hopping amplitude is increased up to a certain critical value @xmath17",
    ", particle delocalization becomes energetically more favorable and the system bose condenses . in the chemical potential vs. hopping matrix element plane ( energies are scaled by @xmath12 ) , the @xmath18 phase diagram has a characteristic lobe shape  @xcite , see also fig .",
    "[ phase_diagram ] below , with the mi phase being inside the lobe ( there is one lobe for each integer filling factor ) .",
    "the most interesting region in the phase diagram is the vicinity of the lobe tip , @xmath19 , corresponding to the mi - sf transition in the commensurate system . for other values of @xmath14 or @xmath3 ,",
    "the sf - mi criticality is trivial and corresponds to the weakly interacting bose gas at vanishing particle density @xcite .",
    "it is straightforwardly described provided the particle ( hole ) effective mass is known . if , however , one crosses the mi - sf boundary at constant commensurate density ( this is equivalent to going through the tip of the lobe at a fixed chemical potential ) the long - wave action of the system becomes relativistic and particle - hole symmetric .",
    "now the phase transition is in the four - dimensional u(1 ) universality class @xcite .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that here we have a unique opportunity of a laboratory realization of the non - trivial relativistic vacuum , a sort of a ",
    "hydrogen atom `` of strongly - interacting relativistic quantum fields . approaching the critical point from the mi side , one deals with the vacuum that supports massive bosonic particles and anti - particles ( particles and holes ) . on the other side of the transition",
    ", the sf vacuum supports massless bosons ( phonons ) that do not have an anti - particle analog . in principle , one can systematically study universal multiparticle scattering amplitudes of the relativistic quantum field theory in the ultra - cold ' ' supercollider \" !",
    "the present study is focused on the three - dimensional ( 3d ) system . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "previous systematic studies of the 3d case were limited to the mean - field ( mf ) @xcite and perturbative methods @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors utilized the strong - coupling expansion to establish boundaries of the phase diagram in the @xmath20 plane .",
    "this approach , based on the small ratio @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the coordination number for the simple cubic lattice , works well only in the mi phase in the region far from the tip of the lobe , where the insulating gap is larger then hopping , @xmath23 .",
    "close to the critical region , where @xmath24 , the strong - coupling expansion is no longer valid .",
    "we present the results of large - scale monte carlo ( mc ) simulations of the model ( [ bh ] ) by worm algorithm @xcite . with precise data for the single - particle green function , we are able to carefully trace the critical and close - to - critical behavior of the system , and , in particular , produce an accurate phase diagram in the region of small insulating gaps @xmath25 . though the corresponding parameter range is quite narrow , it is crucial to clearly resolve it to reveal the emerging particle - hole symmetry and relativistic long - wave physics at the tip of the mi - sf transition .",
    "we also present data for the effective masses of particle and hole excitations inside the insulating phase .",
    "close to the mi lobe tip , the data for the dispersion of the elementary excitations are fitted by the relativistic law , in agreement with the theory ( this also allows us to extract the value of the sound velocity in the critical region ) . in the mott state ,",
    "the knowledge of gaps and effective masses is sufficient to calculate the partition function in the low temperature limit analytically and to make reliable predictions for the system entropy .    for such applications of the system as quantum information processing and interferometry , controlling",
    "the temperature is of crucial importance .",
    "most applications are based on the key property of the good insulating state , which is small density fluctuations in the ground state . at zero temperature fluctuations",
    "are of quantum nature and can be efficiently controlled externally through the @xmath26 ratio . at finite temperature ,",
    "fluctuations are enhanced by thermally activated particle - hole excitations .",
    "only when the temperature is much smaller than the energy gap , the number of excitations is exponentially small . up to date , there are no available experimental techniques to measure the temperature of a strongly interacting system . for weakly interacting systems ,",
    "the temperature can be extracted in a number of ways , e.g. from the interference pattern of matter waves @xcite or the condensate fraction observed after the trap is released and the gas expands freely @xcite these properties are directly related to the momentum distribution function @xmath27 . for strongly interacting systems ,",
    "both temperature and interaction are responsible for filling the higher momentum states , which makes it hard to extract temperature using absorption imaging techniques .",
    "the results presented in this paper can be used to perform accurate thermometry . typically , the initial temperature , @xmath28 , ( before the optical lattice is adiabatically loaded ) is known . by entropy matching one can easily deduce the final temperature of the mi state , @xmath29 , provided the entropy of the mi phase is known .",
    "to this end we have calculated the energy , specific heat and entropy of the system in several important regimes which include mi and strongly correlated sf phases .",
    "these data can be used to suggest appropriate initial conditions which make the bose - hubbard system suitable for physical applications , such as the ones described above .",
    "another interesting question concerns the nature of inhomogeneous states in confined systems when the mi phase is formed in the trap center .",
    "the confining potential provides a scan in the chemical potential of the phase diagram at fixed @xmath26 @xcite . as one moves away from the trap center the system changes its local state . at zero temperature , the density profile of the system",
    "can be read ( up to finite - size effects ) from the ground state phase diagram . at finite temperature , this is no longer possible .",
    "in particular , the liquid regions outside of the mi lobes could be normal or superfluid , depending on temperature .",
    "so far experimental results have been interpreted by assuming that liquid regions are superfluid , but there were no direct measurements or calculations to prove that this was the case . [ part of the problem is that absorption imaging is sensitive only to @xmath30 , which is the fourier transform of the single - particle density matrix in the relative coordinate .",
    "all parts of the system contribute to @xmath30 and it is hard to discriminate where the dominant contribution comes from .",
    "] it is almost certain that @xmath31 of the strongly correlated system is higher then @xmath32 . indeed , since the entropy of mi at @xmath33 is exponentially small , most entropy will be concentrated in the liquid regions . at this point",
    "we notice that the transition temperature in the liquid is suppressed relative to the non - interacting bose gas value @xmath34 by both ( i ) effective mass enhancement in the optical lattice , @xmath35 ( here @xmath36 is the lattice constant ) , and ( ii ) strong repulsive interactions in the vicinity of the mott phase , in fact , @xmath37 at the sf - mi boundary .",
    "it seems plausible that the mi phase is always surrounded by a broad normal liquid ( nl ) region .",
    "it may also happen that superfluidity is completely eliminated in the entire sample in the final state .",
    "[ strictly speaking , at @xmath38 the mi and nl phases are identical in terms of their symmetries and are distinguished only _ quantitatively _ in the density of particle - hole excitations , i.e. in the hamiltonian ( [ bh ] ) the finite - temperature mi is continuously connected without phase transition to nl , see fig .",

    "the critical temperature goes to zero sharply , while approaching the critical point . in the limit of @xmath40",

    "this section deals with the results of large - scale monte carlo simulations for the ground state phase diagram of the bose - hubbard system in three dimensions .",
    "analytical approaches , e.g. the strong coupling expansion , work well in the region where @xmath42 and the system is deep in the mi phase . under these conditions",
    "the kinetic energy term in the hamiltonian can be treated perturbatively and the unperturbed ground state is a product of local fock states . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors carried out an expansion , up to the third order in @xmath43 , for the sf - mi boundaries and estimated positions of critical points at the tips of the mi lobes ( by extrapolating results to the infinite expansion order ) .",

    "@xcite , when the latter is expanded up to the third order in @xmath43 and the dimension of space goes to infinity .",

    "the simulation itself is based on the configuration space of the matsubara green function @xmath46 which is thus directly available .",
