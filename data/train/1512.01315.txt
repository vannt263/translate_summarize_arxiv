    "merging clusters of galaxies is an aspect of gravitational growing of the large scale structure .",
    "while there are many `` apparently circular and relaxed '' clusters , 1020% of the clusters show evidences for on - going merger , consistent with the dynamical timescale of a cluster ( @xmath10 years ) compared to hubble time ( @xmath11 years ) .",
    "the intracluster medium ( icm ) , the vast hot plasma emitting x - rays , permeating the gravitational potential of the cluster is strongly affected by the merger events . in x - rays ,",
    "many mergers have complicated shapes , often strongly elongated , with signatures of complex temperature structure .",
    "entropy of the icm of mergers are often high , considered to be due to heating by shock wave as well as mixing of the outer high entropy gas with inner low entropy ones .    among the 33 flux - limited non - biased samples of rexcess , three ( abell 2399 , abell 3771 and abell 2328 ) show very low surface brightness ( lsb ) , indicating high entropy of the icm .",
    "they all lack bright central core , apparently elongated and/or have sub - structures , showing that they are dynamically young ( bringer et al .",
    "another template of this type of cluster is abell  76 , which has a very low surface brightness and a complicated structure ( ota et al .",
    "2014 ) . by the suzaku observations ,",
    "its icm with a temperature of @xmath12  kev is shown to have very high entropy of @xmath8  kev @xmath9 in its center .",
    "these clusters are outliers in cluster scaling relations , such as icm temperature vs x - ray luminosity ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) relation and their origin is not clear yet .",
    "thus , it is important to understand the nature of these lsb clusters as extreme cases .",
    "abell 548w ( or abell 548b ) is one of the 3 major cluster - sized diffuse x - ray sources detected in the abell 548 region ( e.g. davis et al . 1995 ) .",
    "it has a redshift of @xmath13 ( solovyeva et al .",
    "2008 ) , with the icm temperature of @xmath14  kev and @xmath15 erg s@xmath16 @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 erg s@xmath16 @xmath17 ) at 0.12.4 kev ( davis et al .",

    "hubble constant is @xmath19 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 .",
    "notably , the luminosity is an order of magnitude smaller compared to other clusters with similar temperature ( see , e.g. @xmath0-@xmath1 relation figure 12 of fukazawa et al .",
    "this property make abell 548w a typical lsb cluster .",
    "there are two bright elliptical galaxies in its center , @xmath20 apart , and the x - ray peaks possibly associated with them . on the other hand ,",
    "its x - ray morphology is in general circular , distinct from other lsb clusters .",
    "the cluster is known to have high velocity dispersion of @xmath21  km s@xmath16 ( solovyeva et al .",
    "2008 ) . from the well known @xmath0-@xmath22 relation @xmath23 ( xue et al .",

    "solovyeva et al . (",

    "both sources are polarized by @xmath30% and have a steep spectra of @xmath31 . their origin is not clear , but these properties as well as apparent non - association with any galaxy make them good candidates as cluster radio relics ( feretti et al .",

    ", the authors made a merger model , in which a part of the shocked region shows radio emission while other parts do not , and these two regions are slightly overlapping , i.e. a rather complicated geometry .    to resolve the dynamical status of this cluster , a high - sensitivity observation out to the relic region and farther is needed . in this paper , we revisited this issue with suzaku ( mitsuda et al .",

    "to compare @xmath138 with many other clusters , we also derived the value at @xmath130 .",
    "then we have @xmath144 and @xmath145 , resulting in @xmath146 .",
    "according to pratt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , who analyzed 31 nearby clusters , the averaged gas mass fraction @xmath147 is @xmath148 for a cluster with @xmath149 ( see figure 8 of the paper ) .",
    "thus , also at @xmath130 , abell 548w shows slightly more than a half of @xmath138 of that of the ordinary cluster .",
    "note that there are a few clusters at around @xmath150 which showed @xmath151 as small as 0.05 in their plot . because these plots actually include the three lsb clusters presented at the beginning ( abell 2399 , abell 3771 and abell 2328 ) , it means that abell 548w has a typical @xmath151 of lsb clusters .",
    "while the morphologies of the three lsb clusters are disturbed , that of abell 548w is rather circular , which makes this cluster peculiar . in this scenario we assumed that the icm of this cluster is in hydrostatic equilibrium and",
    "simply its @xmath138 is small . as already noted in , e.g. ota et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , the icm can not be radiatively cooled down to the `` ordinary '' entropy within @xmath152  years , and thus this cluster remains lsb for a long period .",
    "the fact that the xmm image has @xmath5 x - ray peaks possibly associated with the 2 elliptical galaxies in its center , suggests that the cluster is dynamically young .",
    "in addition , as already noted , its galaxy velocity dispersion @xmath153  km s@xmath16 is too high as a @xmath154  kev cluster .",
    "based on the redshift distribution of 193 galaxies in the abell 548w region , solovyeva et al .",
    "( 2008 ) interpreted it as a mixture of 2 clusters each with @xmath155 and @xmath156  km s@xmath16 , merging with a relative velocity of @xmath25  km s@xmath16 .",
    "we then consider a scenario that the icm temperature is heated up by cluster merger . in this case , hydrostatic equilibrium is not taking place , and the relic candidates can be interpreted as the shock front propagating outward .",
    "let s here assume that the icm is heated up by a factor of 1.7 , i.e. it will settle down to 2.1  kev _ after _ final relaxation ( dynamically , not by cooling ) . in this case ,",
    "total mass derived in the last paragraph is overestimated by the same factor .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : fbaryon ] , _ real _ @xmath130 becomes as small as 650  kpc with @xmath157 .",
    "then , @xmath151 reaches 0.08 , which is the typical value shown in figure 8 of pratt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . in the merger scenario , the cool component seen in a few regions can be understood as remnants of the pre - shock low entropy gas .",
    "the simplest toy - model is a line - of - sight , 1:1 major merger , with the pre - shock temperature of @xmath158  kev .",
    "pre - shock sound velocity becomes @xmath159  km s@xmath16 and with a colliding velocity of 1500  km s@xmath16 , it can generate a shock with mach @xmath5 , and hence post - shock temperature of 3.6  kev from rankine - hugoniot conditions .",
    "specifically , defined _ inward _ to the center of gravity of the system , pre - shock bulk velocity is assumed to be @xmath160 ( @xmath161  km  s@xmath16 , that of post - shock 0  km  s@xmath16 , and shock plane velocity _ outward _",
    "@xmath162  km  s@xmath16 . with these parameters ,",
    "the mach number becomes @xmath163 and thus the temperature ratio 2.1 .",
    "here we consider that this cluster ( or two groups ) is ( are ) right at the middle of initial heating phase ( see , e.g. figure 5 of ricker and sarazin 2001 ) . in the following adiabatic expansion , the x - ray luminosity will follow @xmath164 . here",
    ", @xmath165 is ion number density , @xmath166 is total gas mass , and entropy conservation of @xmath167 is applied . with the cluster total mass to be doubled after merger , its future relaxation temperature will be @xmath168 2.8  kev , assuming the @xmath169@xmath170 relation ( @xmath171 by vikhlinin et al .",
    "as the merger moves to later stages , the decreasing temperature will cause the luminosity to get dimmer as @xmath172 .",
    "since @xmath173 in pratt et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , luminosity deficit will be slightly relaxed as the cluster settles down .",
    "in addition , larger scatter in @xmath1 at lower temperature make the peculiarity of this object further relaxed .",
    "in other words , this cluster in future will look like _ one of many low @xmath1 groups of galaxies _ sometimes seen in the @xmath0@xmath1 plot .    although the x - ray properties of abell 548w could be understood if it is a major merger of ( relatively large ) galaxy groups , the merging velocity of @xmath174  km s@xmath16 itself is rather high , and we need to consider its origin in our future work .",
    "what is more , general lack of strong inhomogeneity in both the x - ray morphology and temperature structure requires a finely tuned merger model , e.g. merger axis perfectly aligned to the line of sight , and so on .",
    "other exotic possibilities , such as overheating by agn feedback and inherent baryon fraction deficit , still can not be ruled out with current observational results .",
    "suzaku deep ( 84.4  ks ) observation of abell 548w detected the icm emission out to @xmath128 ( or 880  kpc ) from its center , well beyond the two relic candidates , and measured the icm temperature for the first time out to this radius .",
    "the icm morphology , temperature and entropy do not show strong structure , while marginal evidence for small temperature variation is observed .",
    "the hot ( @xmath6  kev ) component detected with xmm ( solovyeva et al .",
    "2008 ) was not confirmed , although the contaminating point source ( source 1 ) makes it difficult for suzaku to clearly distinguish the inconsistency .",
    "central entropy of the icm is among the highest in a cluster with this temperature , as well .    at the nw candidate relic region ,",
    "symptom of relatively cool ( @xmath134  kev ) component mixed with the @xmath12  kev icm emission is detected .",
    "in addition , marginal temperature jump at the nw relic rim is suggested .",
    "if this is the case , the radio sources are consistent with being relics activated with merger shock .",
    "when assuming hydro - static equilibrium , the gas - mass fraction ( @xmath138 ) of the cluster is estimated to be 0.067 at @xmath129 and 0.052 at @xmath130 , which both are about a half of the value generally seen . considering these observational properties , a merging cluster scenario of two relatively large ( @xmath175  kev ) galaxy groups is discussed .",
    "although these parameters can explain the high entropy nature of the cluster , finely tuned model to address both the high entropy and featureless and apparently circular x - ray properties at the same time will be needed . in other words , if this cluster is a major merger , the merging axis shall be almost completely parallel to the line - of - sight .",
