    "the nuclear symmetry energy of isospin asymmetric nuclear matter is not only important for understanding the structure of neutron- or proton - rich nuclei and the reaction dynamics of heavy - ion collisions , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite , but also plays a crucial role in a number of important issues in astrophysics , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "recently , appreciable progresses have been achieved on constraining the symmetry energy at saturation and subsaturation densities either through the extraction based on astrophysical observations or in terms of terrestrial data  @xcite .",
    "however , the density dependence of the symmetry energy is still poorly known at supra - normal densities  @xcite .",
    "theoretical models predict diverse density dependencies of the symmetry energy at high densities .",
    "noticeably , quite different density - dependent trends of the symmetry energy can be extracted from analyzing the fopi / gsi data on the @xmath1 ratio in relativistic heavy - ion collisions with various transport models  @xcite . in spite of this inconsistency , the theoretical uncertainty of high - density symmetry energy",
    "is regarded to be associated with the tensor force that originates from the exchange terms  @xcite . in the ladder approximation",
    ", the exchange terms can be well treated in the brueckner theory either in the relativistic or non - relativistic frameworks  @xcite . in deed , the vacuum polarizations given by ring diagrams are absent in the brueckner theory .",
    "the inclusion of the ring diagrams is however very complicated . in this work",
    ", we do not carry on the tensor force that appears beyond the hartree approximation but consider the non - nucleonic degrees of freedom in the hartree approximation .",
    "the new degrees of freedom considered here are hyperons and quarks that may appear in dense matter roughly around the density 2 - 4@xmath2 , depending on the parametrization of models  @xcite .",
    "nuclear matter at this density domain can be produced via heavy - ion collisions , and it usually includes the admixture of non - nucleonic degrees of freedom . in the past , the symmetry energy effects on these phase transitions have been found to be very significant  @xcite .",
    "however , the effects of new constituents on the symmetry energy are seldom investigated .",
    "it is not the aim of this work to resolve the uncertainty of the high - density symmetry energy but to reveal the variation of the symmetry energy in phases mixed with these new constituents .",
    "once the phase transition occurs , the system goes to the mixed phase that can be theoretically constructed by virtue of the phase equilibrium conditions , namely , the gibbs conditions in this work . in the mixed phase",
    ", we define the symmetry energy according to the general expression of the energy density that is different from that in pure nuclear matter .",
    "the paper is organized in the following . in sec.ii , we present necessary formulas for the nuclear symmetry energy in pure hadron and mixed phases with the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) framework . the construction of the mixed phase of quarks and baryons are presented briefly . in sec .",
    "iii , the numerical results and discussion are given .",
    "at last , we give a brief summary .",
    "in the parabolic approximation , the energy per nucleon in isospin asymmetric nuclear matter can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the energy per nucleon in symmetric nuclear matter , the @xmath5 is the symmetry energy , and @xmath6 is the isospin asymmetry . in rmf models , the energy density can generally be written as  @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 with @xmath12 the effective mass of nucleon , @xmath13 is the fermi momentum , and @xmath14 is the nonlinear meson self - interacting energy density specifically for the nonlinear rmf models  @xcite . here , the parameters with asterisks denote the density dependence which is given in specific models .",
    "for instance , in nonlinear rmf models , the coupling constants are density - independent , while the meson masses are density - dependent due to the nonlinear self - interacting terms . with eq.([eqe1 ] ) , the symmetry energy in the rmf models can be derived as @xmath15 with @xmath16 .    for hyperon degrees of freedom ,",
    "we consider only the @xmath0 hyperon for simplicity . in this case ,",
    "eq.([eos1 ] ) still holds for hyperonized matter .",
    "the nuclear symmetry energy now reads @xmath17 where @xmath13 is the nucleon fermi momentum , @xmath18 is the number density of nucleons , and @xmath19 .",
    "this formula applies to the case of the given ratio @xmath20 .",
    "the symmetry energy is now suppressed due to the factor @xmath21 . on the other hand , as one source term of meson fields , the @xmath0 hyperon has led to a moderate decrease to the nucleon effective mass and @xmath22 in the kinetic term . together with the suppressed nucleon fermi momentum in @xmath22 ,",
    "the suppression of the kinetic term can be partially compensated .",
    "nevertheless , the symmetry energy eventually turns out to be suppressed in either the baryon - density or nucleon - density profile . in",
    "chemically equilibrated and charge neutral matter , the particle fractions are obtained from solving coupled equations . in this case , the nuclear symmetry energy is given as @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the neutron and proton chemical potentials , respectively . as the isospin asymmetry parameter @xmath26 approaches to vanishing , eq.([esymy1 ] ) reduces to eq.([esymy ] ) .",
    "after the hadron - quark phase transition occurs , hadrons and quarks coexist in a mixed phase .",
    "the construction of the mixed phase is based on the mechanical and chemical equilibriums , namely , the gibbs conditions which are given as  @xcite @xmath27 the pressures of nuclear and quark matter read @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the bag constant of the mit model  @xcite and @xmath30 is the rearrangement term induced by the density dependence of model parameters  @xcite .",
    "for convenient narration , we do not include the @xmath0 hyperons whose addition can be referred to ref .",
    "@xcite . in actual calculations ,",
    "we include the strange meson - hyperon interactions . in terms of the quark phase proportion @xmath31",
    ", the total density can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the baryon density on the hadronic level and @xmath34 is the quark density . using gibbs conditions , one can obtain the quark phase proportion @xmath31 .",
    "the total energy density and isospin asymmetry parameters are written as @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the energy density in the mixed phase thus depends on the @xmath31 . in the parabolic approximation",
    ", the energy density can be expressed as @xmath38 because the volume fraction depends on the isospin asymmetry , we limit the derivation of the symmetry energy @xmath39 in symmetric matter , namely @xmath40 . in this way , the nuclear symmetry energy is defined as @xmath41 at @xmath42 , and the definition of the quark symmetry energy is similarly given as @xmath43 at @xmath44 . bridged by gibbs conditions , the quark volume fraction is model dependent and relies on the mit bag constant . as a result",
    ", similar dependencies on the model and bag constant can be delivered to the symmetry energy . as seen from eqs.([eosm ] ) and ( [ eosm1 ] ) , the nuclear symmetry energy may disappear as the quark fraction grows to be unity at high densities .",
    "we first display numerically the role of @xmath0 hyperons in affecting the nuclear symmetry energy . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , it shows the density profile of the symmetry energy for various @xmath0 fractions with rmf models slc and slcd  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry energy for various @xmath0 fractions is calculated in symmetric matter at @xmath45 .",
    "it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] that the symmetry energy is softened clearly with the increase of the @xmath0 fraction . for chemically equilibrated and charge neutral matter , we see that the symmetry energy starts to soften once the @xmath0 hyperons appear . in this case",
    ", the symmetry energy at lower densities with the slc is identical with that obtained with @xmath46 in symmetric matter , while a small difference appears in results with the slcd , which is associated with the deviation in calculating the symmetry energy at the clearly larger isospin asymmetry in slcd .",
    "the usual case denoted in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] means that the hyperon - nucleon interaction has similar in - medium properties to that of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ( for details , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is the symmetry energy for various @xmath0 hyperon fractions with the separable case whose density dependence of the hyperon potential is different from that of the nucleon potential  @xcite . except for the chemically equilibrated and charge neutral case , results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig1 ] are almost identical .",
    "this can be elaborated by eq.([esymy ] ) because the nuclear symmetry energy in hyperonized matter is dominantly affected by the hyperon fraction . in the separable case ,",
    "the hyperon fraction saturates at the certain high density , and the hyperons disappear at very high density .",
    "thus , in the density profile of the symmetry energy , a concave segment forms .",

    "the label @xmath47 denotes the chemically equilibrated and charge neutral matter.,width=302,height=302 ]     but with different density dependencies for the hyperon and nucleon potentials , denoted as the separable case .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]    with the increase of density , the hadron - quark phase transition may occur . in this work ,",
    "quark matter , regarded as the free fermion gas without interactions , is described with the mit bag model  @xcite . for a simple example , we first deal with the phase transition without hyperons . in a next step , we then include the hyperons .",
    "the mixed phase consists of high - density quark matter and low - density nuclear matter with the quark phase proportion @xmath31 being obtained according to gibbs conditions . here , we do not iterate the solution details which can be found in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the critical density of the hadron - quark transition is model - dependent and also depends on the bag parameter clearly . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , we depict the critical density as a function of isospin asymmetry for various bag parameters and rmf models .",
    "we can observe a few characteristics in fig .",
    "first , the critical density obtained with the tm1  @xcite is much more sensitive to the isospin asymmetry than other models .",
    "the difference may be associated with the softening of the vector repulsion in tm1 , while other models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] do not possess this softening .",
    "second , the critical density increases clearly with the rise of the bag constant .",
    "third , the softening of the symmetry energy just has a moderate effect on the critical density .",
    "the rmf model slcd has a softer symmetry energy than the slc .",
    "the softening of the symmetry energy also occurs in the rmf model nl3w3  @xcite as compared with the model nl3  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the sensitivity of the critical density to the isospin asymmetry reduces generally due to the softening of the symmetry energy .",
    "the exception occurs for models slc and slcd with a smaller bag parameter , see left panel in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .        besides the critical density",
    ", the quark phase proportion @xmath31 also depends on the isospin asymmetry . in this way",
    ", the symmetry energy in the mixed phase obtained in symmetric matter can not simply be used to predict the properties of asymmetric matter because the quark volume fraction changes with the isospin asymmetry in asymmetric matter .",
    "nevertheless , the symmetry energy obtained in symmetric matter is instructive to exhibit its variation trend in the mixed phase . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] is the nuclear symmetry energy as a function of baryon density with the bag constant @xmath48 .",
    "apparent decrease of the symmetry energy can be observed after the hadron - quark phase transition occurs . with the increase of density , the volume fraction of nucleons decreases , which causes a straightforward reduction of the nuclear symmetry energy . as the nucleon volume fraction reduces to zero , the nuclear symmetry energy vanishes .    .",
    ", width=302,height=302 ]    for a smaller bag constant , the critical density is also smaller , and the decrease of the symmetry energy starts at lower densities for various models . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is the symmetry energy with @xmath49 . in this case",
    ", the critical density is around 1.6 - 2.2@xmath2 and the symmetry energy vanishes at densities below 3@xmath2 for all models used in the calculation . for a larger bag constant , quite large difference in the critical density and vanishing density of the symmetry energy exists for different models .",
    "this can be observed by comparing figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] . for a much larger bag constant , for instance , @xmath50 ,",
    "the divergence becomes more appreciable .",
    "nevertheless , once the hadron - quark phase transition occurs , the decrease of the symmetry energy is definite .     but with @xmath49 . ,",
    "width=302,height=302 ]    for the quark phase , the quark symmetry energy @xmath51 which reflects the cost deviating from the flavor symmetric matter starts to have value above the critical density and increases with the rise of the quark volume fraction in the mixed phase , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . after",
    "the quark volume fraction quickly develops to be unity that is a value for pure quark matter , the quark symmetry energy grows quite slowly with the density , since without interactions only the kinetic energy contributes to the symmetry energy .        with the inclusion of hyperons , the reconstruction of the chemical equilibrium with quarks results in a larger critical density .",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] is the nuclear symmetry energy in the hadronic and mixed phases for various fractions of @xmath0 hyperons with rmf models slc and slcd . here",
    ", the bag constant is @xmath52 .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath0 hyperons suppresses the symmetry energy in the hadronic phase , consistent with those shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] . in the mixed phase ,",
    "the influence of @xmath0 hyperons is not prominent due to the suppression factor @xmath53 that decreases quickly . for other bag constants and other rmf models ,",
    "the conclusion is qualitatively similar .",
    "namely , the inclusion of @xmath0 hyperons suppresses the symmetry energy in hadronic phase , and the decrease of the symmetry energy starts at a larger critical density . to save space",
    ", these numerical results are thus not displayed .",
    "-hyperon fractions in hyeronized matter with the hadron - quark phase transition .",
    "the rmf models slc and slcd are adopted here and the bag constant is @xmath54 . , width=302,height=302 ]    we note that the softening of the symmetry energy in the mixed phase is mostly apparent because once the quark volume fraction can be identified at given densities the nuclear symmetry energy would be extracted appropriately by singling out the effect of suppression factor @xmath53 . however , the determination of the @xmath31 is strongly model - dependent and far from experimental feasibility . on the other hand ,",
    "the decreasing factor @xmath53 in the mixed phase largely suppresses the growth of the nucleonic density with the rise of the total density .",
    "if the hyperons are taken into account , the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "thus , the extraction of the high - density symmetry energy for pure nucleonic matter is not well grounded once the hadron - quark phase transition occurs .",
    "most likely , the high - density symmetry energy extracted from the heavy - ion collisions would be as soft as that presented in this work as long as a detailed discrimination or calibration is not ready for dynamically evolutional matter .",
    "at last , it is worth mentioning that the appearance of new degrees of freedom that is energetically favored usually softens the equation of state , resulting in a significant decrease of the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "recently , the pulsar j1614 - 2230 was identified rather accurately through the shapiro delay to have a mass @xmath55  @xcite , which sets up a lower limit of the maximum mass of neutron stars .",
    "this states that the nuclear equation of state should not be softened significantly even with the appearance of new degrees of freedom .",
    "a way out of this dilemma is to consider new forms of interactions for new degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "for quark matter , the imposition of interactions can stiffen the equation of state and hence increase the maximum mass of neutron stars  @xcite .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate whether the interactions of quarks have an effect on the nuclear symmetry energy .",
    "this deserves subsequent work and is however beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "we have studied the effect of @xmath0 hyperons and quarks on the nuclear symmetry energy at high densities with relativistic models .",
    "the softening of the nuclear symmetry energy is observed either in chemically equilibrated matter or matter with an given @xmath0 fraction . with the inclusion of quark degrees of freedom ,",
    "we have constructed the isospin symmetric mixed phase according to gibbs conditions using the rmf models and mit bag model .",
    "the nuclear symmetry energy obtained in the mixed phase reduces quickly with the rise of quark volume fraction .",
    "we have recognized that the specific softening depends on the parametrizations of models .",
    "especially , it has a clear dependence on the bag constant of the mit bag model .",
    "nevertheless , we conclude that the effect of phase transitions is important on the symmetry energy , and for the experimental extraction of the symmetry energy at high densities it is significant and necessary to take into account the effect of phase transitions .",
