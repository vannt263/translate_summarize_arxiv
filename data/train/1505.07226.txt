    "the spectrum of @xcite having @xmath247 is shown as a dashed line in figure [ fig_bh ] , and appears notably below the cib@xmath15cxb requirement .",

    "it is important to emphasize that the sources producing the cib and cxb are not necessarily the same physical emitters and are in general a mixture of stars and bhs sharing the same large scale structures .",
    "however , if they are predominantly bhs emitting in both optical and x - rays they will be accompanied by ionizing uv emission . for agn spectra ,",
    "this contribution is estimated by connecting the optical and x - ray part of the spectrum with a power law slope , shown as dashed lines in figure [ fig_bhsed ] .",

    "for the cib@xmath15cxb signal to arise from the same type of sources therefore requires the suppression of uv photons escaping into the igm ( @xmath252 ) e.g. the black holes to be ultra - obscured @xcite .",
    "this would be easier with unconventional bhs such as dcbhs rather than x - ray binaries from stellar remnants which are much less obscured and are limited in growth by the mass and lifetime of the companion star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "also , for an abundant population of small bhs , a proportionally greater fraction of the net mass goes into the seed of the gravitational collapse and does not contribute to @xmath209 .",
    "in this paper , we assessed the possibility that the established clustering signal in the source - subtracted cib fluctuations at near - ir originates in the early universe .",
    "we consider emission from star formation and black hole accretion during the first 500 myrs and establish the physical requirements and consequences to reach the measured cib values .",
    "our results can be broadly summarized as follows :    * the contribution from high-@xmath6 galaxies , with star formation efficiency set to @xmath79 to match the lf from the deep hst legacy surveys , can not reproduce the levels of unresolved fluctuations in the near - ir for any reasonable extrapolation , producing merely @xmath2  flux at @xmath1 .",
    "in fact , faint galaxies at intermediate-@xmath6 make a larger contribution but are themselves insufficient to account for the entire clustering signal @xcite .",
    "this conclusion is in agreement with previous studies @xcite . *",
    "a simple extrapolation of the faint - end of the lf suggests that high-@xmath6 galaxies will become significant once sources have been removed down to @xmath253 .",
    "using the cib to probe these populations will therefore require jwst @xcite and/or cross - correlation techniques @xcite .",
    "* for more energetically efficient modes of star formation , we find that heavier imfs still require high star formation efficiencies @xmath133 which must either take place in small halos or end before @xmath254 .",
    "the ionizing photons associated with such a population would have to be suppressed to avoid rapid reionization and to enhance the nebular emission contributing to the cib . in other words , it would require very low escape fractions , @xmath5 , in low - mass systems towards high redshifts ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is contrary to what is found in theoretical studies @xcite . *",
    "the cumulative cib contribution of the fossils of the first galaxies that contain old stellar populations radiating throughout cosmic history is comparable to that of their high-@xmath6 progenitors .",
    "since many such systems will merge or become satellites of larger galaxies , their net contribution to the source - subtracted cib is smaller and can be safely neglected as long as the contribution of the high-@xmath6 counterparts is also low .",
    "* for the cib fluctuations to be produced by accreting black holes , one requires vigorous accretion rates in the early universe reaching @xmath7 by @xmath39 .",
    "this quantitative limit assumes a constant efficiency but is mostly independent of the accretion rate history and bh seed masses .",
    "the accretion must be very radiatively efficient at early times and then drop to inefficient growth throughout most of the remaining cosmic time with the resulting population largely unaccounted for in the smbh census in local universe @xcite .",
    "in addition , this population must be extremely gas - obscured in order to i ) avoid reionizing the universe too rapidly , ii ) to suppress the associated soft x - ray background , iii ) to enhance the fraction of energy emitted in the uv as reprocessed nebular emission .",
    "@xcite have designed a novel model of dcbh formation that is broadly consistent with these requirements .",
    "* for the expected level of clustering of sources ( both at low and high-@xmath6 ) , the minimum soft cxb flux implied by the measured cib@xmath15cxb cross - correlation , @xmath255 , is only marginally consistent with the most stringent cxb limits @xcite . at face value",
    "this means that either i ) that high-@xmath6 bhs require the entire available unresolved cxb , ii ) the clustering of the underlying sources is stronger ( e.g. more biased ) with @xmath228 at sub - degree scales , or iii ) the high current uncertainty of the cib@xmath15cxb level at large scales could eventually bring it into agreement with low-@xmath6 agn and xrbs @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we explored the physical requirements for stellar emission and accretion separately .",
    "it is however entirely possible , and in fact plausible , that the cib and cxb are not produced by the same physical sources .",
    "the most intuitive scenario would have the cib produced by stars , whereas accreting black holes sharing the same structures are responsible for the cib@xmath15cxb correlation .",
    "this would be a more natural way to obtain the @xmath256 ratio , which is unconventional for bhs only .",
    "the requirements for bhs to produce the cib@xmath15cxb component only , either stellar remnants or dcbhs , are much less energetically demanding than for the single - population explanation of the cib and cib@xmath15cxb fluctuations .",
    "however , whereas rapid reionization is more easily avoided , one still requires the entire unresolved cxb available and is then left with the problem of explaining the cib , the subject of this paper , by other means .",
    "our study of stellar sources isolates a narrow corner of parameters required for explaining the properties of the measured cib fluctuations in terms of physics and evolution at high-@xmath6 .",
    "the predominant contributions would then have to come from very massive stars ( @xmath257 ) , and accreting black holes , with non - instantaneous reionization in a highly clumped igm .",
    "the area covered by this narrow corner may be widened by a factor of a few by relaxing assumptions of constancy of parameters such as @xmath69 or @xmath200 .",
    "apart from nucleosynthesis and accretion , an additional emission component at high @xmath6 may come from stellar collisions in the dense stellar system phase which may result from stellar dynamical evolution of the early systems ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the specific weight of this component is hard to quantify in a robust model - independent manner , but it may result in additional energy releases and ultimately formation of supermassive bhs @xcite .",
    "it is important to emphasize that narrow allowed parameter - space is predicated on 1 ) the assumption of accurate estimate of the power contained in the primordial density spectrum at very small scales ( comoving kpc ) , and 2 ) the assumption of its time - invariance after the first sources form .",
    "the first drives the collapse of the first halos with tiny modifications in the amount of power leading to exponentially different @xmath258 and , consequently , different , potentially larger cib .",
    "the second possibility may arise from the inevitable and highly complex interaction between the condition of the density field which forms early collapsing objects and the energy releasing sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in this context , recent studies have found that high-@xmath6 galaxies may have had to form surprisingly early to account for the weakening of the exponential decline at the bright end of the lf with increasing redshift @xcite .",
    "this could be achieved by an unusually early collapse with respect to standard clustering theory , or an increased star formation efficiency making the stellar - to - halo mass ratio appear to rise with increasing redshift @xcite . in order to have a significant impact on the cib however",
    ", these effect must also be present in lower mass systems which contribute the bulk of the cib .",
    "all this argues for empirically measuring the cib fluctuations with required fidelity , establishing its nature and then constructing and identifying the implied physics models for the sources producing the signal with all its properties .",
    "this has been demonstrated in multi - wavelength cross - correlation studies that provide further constraints for theoretical models of both low-@xmath6 and high-@xmath6 sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "additional information on the physics and evolution at early times would come by looking for correlations between the cib and 21 cm maps @xcite .",
    "_ euclid _ s large sky coverage and wavelengths make it particularly suitable for using its to - be - measured cib fluctuations to isolate emissions from the epoch of re - ionization ( kashlinsky et al .",
    "2015 , submitted ) and identifying the condition of the igm by cross - correlating _ euclid _ s measured source - subtracted all - sky cib and cmb maps @xcite .",
    "a specific experiment has been recently proposed with the _ jwst_/nircam to probe the lyman - break of the cib component and to tomographically reconstruct the emissions out to @xmath259 @xcite ; the lyman tomography method proposed there was shown to already lead to interesting limits at @xmath259 from the available _ spitzer _ cib maps at 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "the nature of the cib fluctuations should be resolvable in the coming decade and the emissions produced during the epoch of reionization identified from its properties , shedding light on the physics and evolution at that time .",
