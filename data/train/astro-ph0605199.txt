    "@xcite used a lunar occultation of gx5 - 1 to measure the scattered halo directly , finding a total halo intensity ( in the rosat band ) 28% of the source intensity .",
    "gx5 - 1 was also included in the @xcite survey of x - ray halos detected with rosat , where they measured a halo intensity 25.4% of the source intensity .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed 17 x - ray sources , including gx5 - 1 , using a new technique based on the zero - order image of _ chandra _  hetg data .",

    "@xcite first described astrophysical x - ray halos , which result from small - angle scattering of x - rays inside solid matter .",
    "the technique has long been used in laboratory studies of virii or proteins in solution , as careful measurements of the radial profile can show the density and shape of the particles @xcite .",
    "the theory of x - ray halos in an astrophysical setting has been described in detail by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "we briefly review the theory here .",

    "we get ( considering single scatterings only ) the halo surface brightness at angle @xmath18  from the source : @xmath19 where @xmath20  is the total source flux ,  is the hydrogen column density , @xmath21  is the ( normalized ) x - ray spectrum , @xmath22  is the dust grain size distribution , and @xmath23 . here @xmath24  is the density of hydrogen at distance @xmath25  from the observer divided by the line of sight average density , where @xmath26  is the distance to the source @xcite .      if the column density is sufficiently large , individual x - rays may be scattered multiple times .",
    "@xcite showed that for @xmath27 , there are more multiply scattered photons than singly scattered .",
    "multiple scattering tends to broaden the halo in an energy - dependent fashion .",
    "the scattering cross section itself depends upon the x - ray energy and the dust model ; table 1 of @xcite shows that @xmath28 for dust models such as ( * ? ? ?",

    "[ fig : pileup](b ) we show the ratio of grade 0 ( single - pixel events ) to grades 2,3,4 , and 6 for the same three energy bands . in both cases ,",
    "the ratios seem to indicate that within 100  of the source , pileup is affecting the grade ratios . beyond @xmath54",
    "the ratio might change , possibly due to the increasing fraction of background photons .",
    "we limited our analysis to radii beyond @xmath55  to avoid possible contamination .",
    "measuring the spectrum of a strongly piled - up source is difficult , since the source counts can not be directly extracted .",
    "the so - called `` transfer streak , '' created by mispositioned counts that arrived during the frame transfer provide the only clean unpiled spectrum in the data .",
    "the transfer streak has not yet been explicitly calibrated by the _ chandra _",
    "x - ray center team .",
    "nonetheless an accurate spectral measurement is crucial when subtracting the instrumental psf as well as calculating the total dust column density .",
    "our approach is similar to that described in ses02 , except for the treatment of the background .",
    "the source counts were extracted from a 8 pixel wide by 611 pixel long box that stretched across the ccd , with the exception of the region within 100  of gx5 - 1 ( 203 pixels ) , which was excluded to avoid pileup .",
    "the allowed region contained 48465 counts , with a total observing time of 6868.7 seconds , or a total of 2146 3.2 second ccd `` frames . ''",
    "each ccd frame , therefore , had @xmath56counts in the transfer streak , spread over a 8@xmath57611 pixel box so pileup in the readout streak is not significant .",
    "since the 8 pixel wide box contains essentially all of the transfer streak , the total effective exposure time for the transfer streak is 2146 frames @xmath57  611 rows / frame @xmath58s / row = 53.76 seconds .",
    "it is important to note that this is the exposure time for the _ source _  counts .",
    "the background flux ( measured using boxes parallel but above and below the source boxes ) is caused by scattered photons from gx5 - 1 , cosmic rays , and other sources .",
    "these events could arrive during the transfer streak , but are much more likely to occur during the 3.2 s hold time , so the appropriate exposure time is the full 6868.7 seconds .",
    "this is an unusual situation : the exposure times for the source and background photons in the source spectrum are different , and none of the standard spectral tools ( xspec or sherpa ) can explicitly deal with it .",
    "we dealt with this problem by treating both the source and background as having the full exposure time of 6868.7 seconds , and then scaling the source flux by the ratio of the exposure times , @xmath59 .    after extracting the source and background spectra",
    ", we found an adequate fit using an absorbed bremsstrahlung model ( @xmath60 ) with @xmath61@xmath2 , @xmath62kev , and @xmath20(1 - 10 kev)@xmath63erg/@xmath33/s ( absorption corrected ) .",
    "fortuitously , there was also a 9 ksec hetg observation of gx5 - 1 ( obsid 716 ) done july 18 , 2000 , only 19 days before the acis observation described here .",
    "although gx5 - 1 is a variable source , the xte all - sky monitor shows little change between the two observations . in the 1.3 - 3.0 kev channel ,",
    "the rxte count rate was @xmath64during the hetg observation and @xmath65  during our acis observation . in the 5.0 - 12.1 kev channel ,",
    "the count rates were @xmath66  and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "the hetg observations of gx5 - 1 have been analyzed by @xcite in order to measure the elemental absorption along the line of sight .",
    "as noted in  1 , they found the total @xmath3@xmath2 , based on extrapolation primarily from mg , si , s , and fe absorption features .",
    "their spectral model was more complicated than ours , but their total ( absorption corrected ) @xmath20(1 - 10 kev)@xmath68erg/@xmath33/s .",
    "this is @xmath69% lower than our result from the transfer streak which may be due to true variation in the source .",
    "however , given the limited data available for the acis transfer streak , this 20% variation may also be due to calibration uncertainties . in any event , although this overall flux uncertainty will be reflected in the measured dust column density , but does not affect the profile of the halo",
    ".      to calculate the radial profile of gx5 - 1 , we first identified the serendipitous sources from the image , using the ciao routine celldetect .",
    "we then selected an energy grid ( 1 - 4 kev , @xmath70kev ) and a radial grid ( 100 points from 10 - 800  , log - spaced ) .",
    "we filtered the data using the measured ccd energy , and extracted the counts in the radial profile using concentric annuli centered on the source . after making exposure maps for each energy band , we filtered out the regions with serendipitous sources in both the data and each exposure map .",
    "we then extracted the effective `` radial exposure '' using the same concentric annuli , for each energy band . dividing the radial profile of the counts in each band by the effective area and exposure time",
    "gave the corrected radial profile in units of photons @xmath2 s@xmath34 arcmin@xmath71  per energy band .",
    "we then divided this by the observed source flux in each band to get the fractional radial profile in units of source fraction arcmin@xmath71 .",

    "the _ chandra _  psf was measured from observations of her x-1 .",
    "we also note that the _",
    "chandra_psf is small enough that we can neglect scattering of the x - ray halo by the telescope .",

    "the co emission toward gx5 - 1 ( figure  [ fig : co ] ) is confined to 4 broad lines that can be readily associated with three distinct regions of the galaxy .",
    "first , the line peaking near -22 km  s@xmath34  almost certainly arises from the 3 kpc expanding arm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of the best - defined spiral arms in the galaxy .",
    "it is seen tangentially at @xmath75 , implying a galactic radius of 3.46 kpc ( assuming a distance to the galactic center of 8.5 kpc ) . since the inclination of the arm is unknown , we assumed it is circular to calculate its distance as 5.1 kpc at @xmath76longitude .",
    "a second region is associated with the line at 22 km  s@xmath34 , which arises from the so - called molecular ring .",
    "this is the region of high molecular cloud density roughly half - way between the sun and the galactic center .",
    "the near and far kinematic distances of this gas are 4.7 kpc and 12.1 kpc , with uncertainties of @xmath77kpc imposed by the cloud - cloud velocity dispersion . at the far distance",
    "the molecular gas would lie 215 pc above the plane , more than 4 times the vertical dispersion of molecular clouds @xcite , so the near distance is far more likely .",
    "it is worth noting that most of the molecular ring emission closer to the plane at @xmath78  is centered roughly 10 km  s@xmath34lower than that toward gx5 - 1 ; this ( mildly ) suggests that the molecular - ring emission toward gx5 - 1 might be anomalously high by that amount .",
    "if so , its kinematic distance should be reduced to @xmath79kpc ; this possibility is also noted in table  [ tab : cloud ] .",
    "we conclude that the molecular ring gas probably lies 3 - 5 kpc from the sun .",
    "given the extreme velocity crowding at this low longitude , it s possible that numerous clouds are spread over this range .",
    "a third region is associated with the other two partially - blended lines .",
    "these lines are at such high velocities ( @xmath53  200 km  s@xmath34 ) that the emitting region must lie near the tangent point , at a galactic radius of 0.7 kpc and thus near the galactic center at a distance of @xmath80kpc .",
    "distances for the main molecular concentrations along the line of sight to gx5 - 1 are summarized in table  [ tab : cloud ] .",
    "the molecular column density , n(h@xmath74 ) , corresponding to each of the co lines can be calculated from their velocity - integrated intensities , w@xmath81 . for the molecular ring emission",
    "we use a standard galactic value for @xmath82  n(h@xmath74)/w@xmath83@xmath2k@xmath34km@xmath34s @xcite . since there is evidence from both diffuse gamma ray emission @xcite and far infrared dust emission @xcite that molecular clouds in the galactic center region are anomalously bright in co , we reduced @xmath84  by a factor of 5 for the two high - velocity lines near the galactic center . the molecular cloud in the 3 kpc arm",
    "might also be anomalously bright in co , given the arm s proximity to the galactic center and large non - circular motion .",
    "our results are given in table  [ tab : cloud ] , along with the corresponding atomic column densities derived from the 21 cm survey of @xcite .",
    "the interpolated 21 cm spectrum toward the source shows velocity components similar to those seen in co. we found a total column density along the line of sight of @xmath85@xmath2 , in good agreement with the @xcite value of @xmath86@xmath2 . the total gas column density , @xmath87n(h@xmath74 ) +",
    "n ( ) , is @xmath88@xmath2 , or @xmath89@xmath2 , depending upon the value of @xmath84  used for the 3 kpc arm gas ( see table  [ tab : cloud ] ) .    as with many x - ray binaries ,",
    "the true distance to gx5 - 1 is not well determined .",
    "we use the @xcite upper limit of 9 kpc , based on its flux and calculated eddington luminosity . comparing this upper limit with table  [ tab : cloud ]",
    "shows that gx5 - 1 is almost certainly behind the 3 kpc arm and the molecular ring , but may be in front of , behind , or embedded in the galactic center region .",
    "the radial profile of the x - ray halo depends on the dust position relative to the source flux , but since x - ray halos are due to forward scattering , dust behind the source is unimportant .",
    "gx5 - 1 is one of the brightest persistent x - ray sources in the galaxy , and its relatively large absorption column density means that it has a substantial x - ray halo .",
    "the co and observations also constrain the fit parameters . as a result ,",
    "gx5 - 1 is one of the best sources to use in testing is dust models .",
    "we therefore collected a wide range of proposed dust models : mrn77 , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wd01 ) , and the 15 models proposed in ( * ? ? ? * zda04 ) ( most notably their bare - gr - b model ) , as well as the model including extremely large grains discussed in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wsd01 ) .",
    "these models were developed to match optical , uv , and ir observations of dust primarily found in diffuse clouds ( or , in the case of wsd01 , _ in - situ_data ) without consideration of their x - ray scattering properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : sizedist][left ] shows the size distributions for three models , while figure  [ fig : sizedist][right ] shows the size distributions weighted by @xmath90 , making them proportional to the total x - ray scattering cross section following equation  [ eq : rg ] ( after integrating over all scattering angles ; see @xcite ) .",
    "this shows that the differences in the largest grains must dominate the results . by systematically comparing all of these to the gx5 - 1 data",
    ", we can determine which models agree with the observed x - ray scattering , and which do not .",
    "however , it is important to realize that the dust grains scattering the x - rays from gx5 - 1 are primarily in dense clouds , and may have quite different properties from the dust in diffuse clouds .",
    "therefore , this study can not globally exclude dust models , but simply determine which could describe the dust in dense clouds and which can not .",
    "our results are additionally limited by the extreme pile - up , which obscures the true profile when @xmath91 .",
    "dust very near the source ( _ e.g. _  the clouds in the galactic center region ) will lead to scattered photons in our insensitive `` near region '' ( see also figure  [ fig : nearprofile ] ) in addition , the number of scattered photons at every angle is proportional to @xmath92 , so errors in the measured flux linearly correlate with errors in the dust column density .",
    "finally , the total column density towards the source is not well - known .",
    "the measurement by @xcite of @xmath93@xmath2  is reasonably precise , but its accuracy depends entirely on the spectral model assumed . the same is true of our best - fit value @xmath94@xmath2 ( see  [ subsec : spec ] ) , with the additional caveat that calibrating a transfer streak spectrum is challenging . the @xcite result of @xmath95@xmath2 , based on absorption features seen in high - resolution spectra , is accurate but far less precise . considering the uncertainties on the hi  large - scale optical depth the co - to - h@xmath74  conversion factor ,",
    "the value of @xmath96@xmath2  derived from the gas tracers is probably only good to within a factor of 2 .",
    "based on all these results , the most we can say with confidence is that  is likely in the range @xmath97@xmath2 .",
    "if our x - ray halo results are outside this range , it would imply is that the dust / gas mass ratio along this line of sight is abnormally high or low .",
    "therefore , we can not impart too much significance to the overall normalization of our results .",
    "however , we can require that the best - fit column density be independent of energy , and that the shape of the profile conform to the observations .",
    "although the co data strongly implies the dust along the line of sight is clumped , we begin with the simplest x - ray halo model , where the dust is assumed to be smoothly distributed along the line of sight ( @xmath98 ) , and that it scatters the x - rays at most once @xcite .",
    "we begin by showing the radial profiles fit with some of the most common or best - fitting dust models , to show the quality of the results .",
    "figure  [ fig : smoodust ]  shows the radial profile of gx5 - 1 at @xmath99  and @xmath100kev , fit using a single - scattering smooth dust distribution .",
    "we show three different dust models : the classic mrn77 model as well as the more recent wd01 ( with @xmath101 ) and the bare - gr - b model from zda04 .",
    "the best - fit column densities were ( respectively ) @xmath102 , @xmath103 , and @xmath104@xmath2at 1.5 kev and @xmath105 , and @xmath106@xmath2  at 2.5 kev . at 1.5 kev",
    "all the fits were inadequate , although the zda04 model was the best fit .",
    "although at 1.5 kev mie effects could affect the halo slightly , a fit including these did not significantly change the results .",
    "however , as noted in  [ subsec : multiscat ] , comparing with figure  [ fig : multiscat ] shows that including multiple scattering might have improved the zda04 model fit .",
    "unfortunately , including multiple scattering from smoothly distributed dust in these fits is not yet implemented .",
    "however , in the case of gx5 - 1 the dust is almost certainly _ not _  smoothly distributed and so this enhancement is left to a future paper . at 2.5 kev ,",
    "figure  [ fig : multiscat][right ] showed that multiple scattering is far less important , and we see in figure  [ fig : smoodust][right ] that the zda04 model fit the radial profile of gx5 - 1 reasonably well @xmath107zda04@xmath108 .",
    "the mrn77 and wd01 models were still poor fits with @xmath107mrn77@xmath109  and @xmath107wd01@xmath110 .",

    "values for each dust model used , assuming smoothly - distributed dust along the line of sight and using the data between 2.5 - 3.5 kev in 0.2 kev bins .",
    "at these energies , multiple scattering should be largely insignificant .",
    "[ fig : smoothchisq ] ]    we then fit the gx5 - 1 radial profile data for energies between 2.5 - 3.5 kev ( in 0.2 kev wide bins ) to a model consisting of the _ chandra _  psf , a flat background , and the scattered halo calculated for smoothly - distributed dust following each of the above dust models . in figure",
    "[ fig : smoothchisq ]  we show the @xmath111  values for each best - fit model .",
    "while none of the models are formally acceptable , clearly some are preferred .",
    "for example , none of the composite models of zda04 ( those beginning with comp- ) , with the possible exception of comp - gr - b , are even close to a reduced @xmath112 , while the bare - gr - b model is a reasonably good fit ( @xmath113 ) , as would be expected from the results in figure  [ fig : smoodust ] .    while instructive , figure  [ fig : smoothchisq ]  is not conclusive",
    "first , gx5 - 1 s brightness means that the errors are probably not statistical but are instead dominated by calibration errors in the psf and effective area .",
    "second , the assumption of smoothly distributed dust disagrees strongly with the co observations and is almost certainly incorrect . at the same time , the consistently poor fits found when using the composite models of zda04 suggests that these models poorly describe the observations . in figure",
    "[ fig : smcompprof][left ] we show the fits to the radial profiles using the comp - gr - b , comp - ac - s , and comp - nc - fg models .",
    "all of these over - predict the scattering at small angles and under - predict it at large angles . since larger grains create smaller halos",
    ", this suggests that these models have relatively too many large grains .",
    "interestingly , however , the best - fit column densities ( shown in figure  [ fig : smcompprof][right ] ) are almost all in the @xmath97@xmath2  range , with the exception of the last six models . in general , then , these models have problems not with the total mass of dust required , but rather the relative distribution of large and small grains .",
    "and the cloud position is 33% of the distance to the source ; @xmath114 .",
    "the mrn77 and wd01 models , despite their similar appearance , are worse fits with @xmath115 respectively .",
    "[ fig : onecloud ] ]    although the good smoothly - distributed zda04 bare - gr - b model fit could be taken as evidence for that model over the others considered , we must also consider the possibility that the match is at least partially fortuitous as the dust is almost certainly clumped into the same clouds seen in co emission . in this case",
    "the halo profile depends upon the relative positions of the clouds and the source .",
    "we start by considering the simplest possible model , a single cloud with variable relative position and column density .",
    "the parameters were allowed to vary freely without any assumptions taken from the co observations .",
    "this model again includes only single scattering .",
    "we begin with fits to the same three dust models ( see figure  [ fig : onecloud ] ) , and again find the best results from the zda04 bare - gr - b model . at 2.5 kev , all models appears to fit equally well but only the zda04 bare - gr - b model has plausible fit parameters .",
    "the best - fit column densities for the mrn77 , wd01 , and bare - gr - b models were @xmath116@xmath2 , respectively and the best - fit dust positions ( in units of fractions of the total distance to the source ) were @xmath117  and 0.32 . in both cases ,",
    "the mrn77 and wd01 parameters are well outside the expected values .",
    "in addition , the bare - gr - b model s best - fit column density appeared to be nearly constant with energy , unlike the other two models , and it had the lowest overall @xmath111  values .",
    "the best - fit zda04 bare - gr - b model had @xmath118@xmath2  and position @xmath119% of the distance to gx5 - 1 , with slight variation between @xmath120  as a function of energy .",
    "nonetheless , even this fit is formally unacceptable ( @xmath121 ) at most energies .",
    "note that all fits strongly rejected the result found by @xcite , who found @xmath122% of the dust to be very near the source .",
    "we now consider a more complex spatial distribution of dust clouds , based on the co data .",
    "the single cloud results foreshadow possible consistency problems between the scattered x - rays and a `` naive '' interpretation of the co data . as table  [",
    "tab : cloud ] shows , multiple interpretations of the co data itself are possible .",
    "the 3 kpc arm may have substantial or insignificant amounts of dust , and the molecular ring dust may be at either 4.7 or 3.3 kpc .",
    "we considered all combinations of these options , and decided to use a value of @xmath123@xmath2  for the 3 kpc arm column density and a distance of 3.3 kpc for the molecular ring , as other choices led to a poorer fit to the data for all dust models .",
    "of course , this may be an indication that there is a problem either in the calibration or the dust models , but we first examine if the closer distance can lead to a good result .        in figure",
    "[ fig : multicloud][left ] we show the halo profile fit using these preferred values from the co observations to fix the cloud column densities and positions , and show the expected halos from a zda04 model considering single scattering only with three different positions . in this case",
    "the only variable fit parameter is the source flux . for these fits ,",
    "the best - fit value is within 25% of the flux measured from the transfer streak , within the calibration uncertainty .",
    "once again , the zda04 model fits were superior to either the mrn77 or wd01 models , and so for clarity only the zda04 model is shown .",
    "a distance of 15 kpc is clearly a poor fit , over - predicting the halo brightness at nearly all angles ( a distance of @xmath124kpc for gx5 - 1 would also imply the source has a consistently super - eddington luminosity @xcite ) .",
    "the best - fit appears to be bracketed between the 7 - 9 kpc distances , although neither of these is truly an acceptable fit .",
    "only single - scattering was considered for these plots ; multiple scattering would tend to broaden the halo slightly and might improve the fit slightly for the 7 kpc distance .",
    "however , as shown in figure  [ fig : multiscat][right ] , the improvement would only be marginal and is unlikely to explain the entire difference .    in figure  [",
    "fig : multicloud][right ] we again show the @xmath125values for each best - fit model , this time for the multiple cloud model as suggested by the co data .",
    "we assumed a distance for gx5 - 1 of 8 kpc , which gave the best overall results .",
    "as with figure  [ fig : smoothchisq ] , none of the models are formally acceptable , although some of the same models are again preferred , most notably the zda04 bare - gr - b model .",
    "as with the smoothly - distributed dust model , the composite dust models of zda04 , especially the `` comp - nc '' models which use no carbon , give very poor fits .",
    "we have extracted the spectrum and scattered halo from gx5 - 1 , one of the brightest galactic x - ray binaries .",
    "although the spectrum had to be extracted from the poorly - calibrated transfer streak , we were able to confirm the result due to a fortuitous hetg observation taken nearly contemporaneously with the acis observation along with the rxte all - sky monitor data .",
    "gx5 - 1 is so bright that pileup was evident out to a radius of @xmath55 .",
    "nonetheless , we were able to extract reliable surface brightness profiles between @xmath126 .",
    "gx5 - 1 has a large ( but rather poorly determined ) column density which is likely in the range @xmath97@xmath2 .",
    "it is also close enough to the galactic plane that velocity - resolved co measurements exist which show the presence of a number of dense clouds along the line of sight .",
    "we have shown that gx5 - 1 s column density is large enough that x - rays with energies below 2 kev are often scattered multiple times by dust along the line of sight .",
    "since this is a complication to fitting , we limited our fitting to energies above 2.5 kev where multiple scattering is much less significant .",
    "we compared our observations to a wide range of dust grain models , including for the first time the many models described in zda04 .",
    "we found reasonable fits for some dust models assuming either a smooth dust distribution or a single `` cloud '' along the line of sight .",
    "no dust grain model fit the default parameters determined from the co data for any distance to gx5 - 1 .",
    "however , the fit parameters found when using a single cloud suggested a re - examination of the co data .",
    "the 3 kpc arm ( at 5.1 kpc ) is on the boundary between the galactic center , where the co is anomalously bright @xcite , and the galactic disk .",
    "if the gas in the 3 kpc arm is in fact similar to the galactic center emission , it would have only 1/5th of the molecular gas ( and associated dust ) as predicted in table  [ tab : cloud ] . in this case",
    ", most of the dust would be the one in the molecular ring , which at 3.3 kpc is roughly 1/3 of the distance to the galactic center and which has a predicted hydrogen column density of @xmath127@xmath2 . when using these values , we found better fits but somewhat surprisingly still not as good as the smooth dust distribution results .",
    "more data from x - ray binaries at or near the galactic center are needed to see if in fact this interpretation of the co data holds when compared to other x - ray halo observations in this area , or is merely special pleading .",
    "we also note our strong disagreement with the results of @xcite regarding the dust density along the line of sight .",
    "although we are not as sensitive to dust near the source as their observation , the effects would still be noticeable in our results .",
    "we do not know the origin of this discrepancy , but note that they found significant amounts of dust near all of their sources .",
    "it seems possible that there may be calibration issues , especially in the zero - order of the hetg , which are in some part responsible for their result .",
    "we also found that some dust grain models strongly disagreed with the observations in all cases .",
    "most notably , nearly all of the composite dust models of zda04 ( models beginning with comp- ) disagreed strongly with the data ( the sole exception is the comp - gr - b model ) .",
    "the composite `` no carbon '' ( comp - nc ) models in particular were uniformly poor descriptions .",
    "the bare - gr - b model , which combines bare graphite and silicate grains with pahs using b star abundances , was the overall best fitting model in all cases .",
    "however , since no dust model or spatial distribution led to @xmath128  fits , and given remaining uncertainties in the calibration and the modeling we can not state that this dust model is `` preferred . ''",
    "three different dust position distributions are shown : smoothly distributed dust , a single cloud 1/3 of the distance to gx5 - 1 , and three clouds at the positions predicted by the co data , assuming a source distance of 8.51 kpc .",
    "[ fig : nearprofile ] ]    the idea of directly measuring the is dust mass , composition , and size distribution is enticing enough that it appears in every proposal to observe x - ray halos .",
    "however the history of astronomical x - ray scattering halo results shows that there are difficulties arising from the many assumptions needed before the data can be modeled .",
    "although not conclusive , our results show that adding co and hiobservations do help in reducing the allowed model space and putting better constraints on the dust models . however , the uncertainties in the co and hi  analysis must be included to sensibly use this additional data .",
    "we plan to test our results by analyzing more galactic center sources to see if , for example , they also imply that the 3 kpc arm is co - bright .",
    "another way to break the existing near - degeneracy between dust models would be to obtain measurements of the radial profile between @xmath129 .",
    "figure  [ fig : nearprofile ] shows that variations in dust grain positions affect the surface brightness at these angular distances far more than in the @xmath126  region measurable with our data .",
    "we have just obtained _ chandra _  hrc - i observations of gx5 - 1 which will measure the radial profile in this range ( albeit without energy resolution ) .",
