    "while none of these agree with the 3d - xy scaling behavior , it is widely believed that the results on pure single crystals are indicative of the intrinsic critical fluctuations of the superconducting transition .",
    "transport measurements have probed the dynamics of the critical fluctuations , which are characterized by the value of the dynamic critical exponent @xmath13 describing how the relaxation time @xmath14 scales with the correlation length @xmath15 : @xmath16 . however for ybco , experiments have not yielded a consistent picture .",
    "for example , longitudinal dc - resistivity measurements @xcite yield @xmath17 in magnetic fields up to @xmath18 t , while microwave conductivity measurements @xcite are consistent with @xmath19 .",
    "still larger values for the dynamic exponent ranging from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , reminiscent of glassy dynamics , have also been seen in resistivity measurements @xcite in thin films .",
    "these large values of @xmath13 strongly suggest that disorder plays a dominant role in these thin films , and this may explain why their observed static critical behavior differs from that of the best single crystals .",
    "critical fluctuation results on bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 ( bscco ) are even more dissimilar , partially due to highly anisotropic fluctuations .",
    "the complex conductivity of underdoped bscco films measured at terahertz frequencies was found to agree with a kosterlitz - thouless - berezinskii ( ktb ) model with diffusive dynamics.@xcite in previous work on bscco crystals a non - linear transport study found 2d critical behavior with an anomalous dynamic exponent of @xmath22 and no crossover to 3d behavior.@xcite the 3d universal phase angle of the complex conductivity deduced from the magnetic susceptibility of bscco epitaxial films and crystals has even yielded larger values of @xmath13.@xcite only dc fluctuation conductivity measurements in bscco @xcite find relaxational dynamics , @xmath23 , _ assuming _ a 3d - xy static exponent , @xmath24 , in agreement with recent theoretical work that predicts that @xmath4 in 3d.@xcite these results indicate the lack of consensus on the true nature of the dynamic fluctuations representative of the superconducting transition , which is the primary motivation of the present investigation . while a large value of the dynamic exponent @xmath25 can be understood as disorder effects , only the presence of a previously undetected collective mode coupled to the superfluid density would lead to @xmath26 in 3d , just as occurs in superfluid he@xmath27.@xcite    in this paper we provide results on the critical fluctuations in high quality epitaxially - grown bscco films . we have measured the ab - plane complex conductivity with a two - coil inductive technique at zero applied magnetic field ( @xmath28 ) , described in section ii . our measurements , presented in section iii , indicate that the critical fluctuations in bscco films are consistent with the 3d - xy critical fluctuation model , rather than a ktb transition within the layers .",

    "however , the breakdown of linear response theory becomes important near the transition temperature @xmath3 , so that the analysis is complicated by the need to extract the superfluid density from the measured mutual inductance by an approximate inversion technique .",
    "our analysis shows that the determination of @xmath13 purely from linear response theory is contaminated by non - linear effects , and at probe currents that are too large the effective value of @xmath13 inferred can be as low as 1.5 . to circumvent this problem , we derive in section vii a non - linear scaling law obeyed by the raw measured mutual inductance at @xmath3 ( i.e. without the need for a data inversion ) and extract the dynamic exponent directly from the mutual inductance . in agreement with the linear response analysis ,",

    "when the superfluid density is a fraction of the 3d crossover ( @xmath80 ) , we observe a drop in the superfluid density from the static scaling value .",
    "although this could be interpreted as a crossover to 2d behavior , we do not believe this to be the case in our films since the drop is observed to be current as well as frequency dependent ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . notice that the superfluid density does drop more rapidly than expected from the 3d - xy model as the frequency is decreased for a given drive current , but does so more slowly as the current is decreased at fixed frequency .",
    "while the former might lead one to conclude that the anisotropic 3d - xy behavior is no longer valid in the static limit , the latter would imply the opposite .",
    "more accurate measurements are needed at low frequency and currents to establish unambiguously the true nature of the static limit .",

    "the @xmath96-dependence must cancel out of the expression for @xmath97 , which implies that the asymptotic behavior of the scaling function @xmath98 as @xmath99 where @xmath100 . for @xmath101 , we can write    @xmath102    where the scaling function @xmath103 const as @xmath104 . we now ask what behavior we should observe as @xmath105 for @xmath106 . for @xmath105 at @xmath107 , we should see the critical point behavior .",

    "thus at a finite @xmath114 , for @xmath115 we would observe critical behavior while for @xmath116 we would not . we have used the critical exponents @xmath117 and @xmath118 for specificity , but the argument does not rely on these precise values . note that , as is generally the case with crossover , the behavior of the superfluid density away from the critical point at finite frequencies is not universal except in the large frequency limit - a result that is sometimes found to be surprising , but which follows from a generic crossover analysis of relevant variables .",
    "@xcite this predicted low frequency behavior is consistent with our data where we observe the critical phase angle in fig .",

    "since the constant phase angle is a result from linear response theory , the estimate of the dynamic exponent from the data is expected to be more accurate at smaller currents .",
    "this is indeed seen in the current dependence of the phase angle at different frequencies for film c. in fig .",

    "this phase angle is @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 respectively .",
    "this suggests that @xmath133 in film c and the result of @xmath26 from film b is an artifact of the large current used in the measurement . with this analysis",
    ", the thickest film ( c ) exhibits the best estimate of the critical phase angle , the film with intermediate thickness ( b ) provides evidence for similar behavior , but the thinnest film did not show a critical phase angle . due to the crossover phenomena discussed in the previous section ,",
    "the behavior of the phase angle away from @xmath3 is not universal at low frequencies , but we can still infer the dynamic critical exponent from the critical phase angle at @xmath3 which is indeed universal .    both the phase angle and the superfluid density",
    "are found to be dependent on the drive current near @xmath3 . in the limit of smaller currents ,",
    "the frequency independent critical phase angle does indeed yield a dynamic exponent of @xmath23 .",
    "this is a result consistent with the presence of @xmath134 fluctuations .",
    "this is also consistent with the behavior of the superfluid density with decreasing current at fixed frequency , where it is seen to approach the asymptotic static scaling law .",
    "furthermore , the smooth evolution of the phase angle suggests that the crossover to the 2d regime near @xmath83 is not resolved in our experiment . nevertheless , considering that nonlinear scaling and dimensional crossover is expected close to @xmath3 , we now proceed to analyze the nonlinear response to get a more accurate determination of the dynamic exponent .",
    "the field equation governing the vector potential , @xmath135 , is    @xmath136    where @xmath137 is the current density in the drive coil , @xmath138 is the conductivity of the superconducting film , and @xmath139 is the electric field . for the geometry of the setup , @xmath140 in cylindrical coordinates , where @xmath141 is the drive current , @xmath142 is the radius of the drive coil and @xmath143 is the distance from the film to the drive coil.@xcite for an anisotropic system , in the critical regime , the superfluid density , @xmath97 , scales as , @xmath144 where @xmath145 and @xmath81 are the correlation lengths parallel and perpendicular to the cuo bilayers , and @xmath146 is a scaling function .",
    "we can rewrite the field equation as @xmath147 where we have used the scaling form for the complex conductivity . since the scaling function is written in terms of dimensionless variables we can non dimensionalize the equation by recasting it in terms of @xmath148 and @xmath149 .",
    "the solution then takes the form , @xmath150 where @xmath151 is a function that can be determined by solving the full non - linear field equation and @xmath152 is the thermal length given by @xmath153 . so far",
    "all we have done is to use the scaling form for the superfluid density and looked for a generic solution of a differential equation by identifying all the non - dimensional variables . for a given geometry of the experiment the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ nondim_a ] is a function of three variables .",
    "one can further simplify the expression if we realize that there exists a regime @xmath154 where we are governed by the limit where @xmath155 .",
    "this allows us to eliminate one of the three terms as follows .",
    "close to @xmath3 , using the 3d - xy behavior of the correlation length and the definition of @xmath83 , we can rewrite @xmath156 as , @xmath157 for a temperature range @xmath158 , @xmath159 . thus , for temperatures within @xmath160 , @xmath161 , and @xmath85k of @xmath83 for films a , b , and c respectively , this approximation is valid , and the field in eq .",

    "the reason for this is that the solution ( eq . [ nondim_a ] ) depends on a number of variables , but sufficiently close to @xmath3 there exists a regime wherein the mutual inductance is only a function of one scaling variable .",
    "if we do not observe any data collapse we would conclude that we are never in the regime where the approximation @xmath159 is valid .",
    "it is indeed true that the elimination of the dependence of @xmath145 in eq .",
    "[ nondim_a ] is possible only at @xmath3 and need not hold in the entire regime where the crossover occurs .",
    "it is tempting to interpret the experimental results in terms of a 2d system .",
    "our data on the other hand are unable to resolve the crossover regime , and yet do exhibit data collapse ( see fig 4 ) .",
    "this suggests that the temperature at which we observe data collapse lies in the crossover regime , but is not necessarily the true @xmath3 . from our analysis",
