    "when multiple competing options are available as in election , humans influence each other as well as are influenced by external input such as mass media to determine their opinions .",
    "mechanisms of collective opinion formation have been studied with the use of various models including the voter model , ising model and its variants , and coupled phase oscillators . here",
    "we study dynamical behavior of a nonlinear opinion formation model with some contrarian agents who try to avoid the opinion adopted by others .",
    "the remainder of agents are congregator agents that imitate others opinions with a certain rate , as assumed in many other models .",
    "we mainly investigate the bifurcation scenario of the mean - field dynamics of this agent - based model , where the nonlinearity with which an agent complies with the majority voting is taken as a chief bifurcation parameter .",
    "when the nonlinearity is weak , the model allows egalitarian coexistence of the two competing opinions . at an intermediate level of nonlinearity ,",
    "the egalitarian equilibrium is not stable , and a limit cycle appears . with strong nonlinearity , two asymmetric equilibria in which one opinion overwhelms the other opinion are stable .",
    "the asymmetric equilibria coexist with the limit cycle , and the structure of the attractive basins is progressively complicated as the nonlinearity is increased .",
    "in society , humans may possess different opinions about the same issue and communicate with each other to update their opinions .",
    "phenomenology and mechanisms of collective opinion formation have been investigated with the use of various mathematical and agent - based models @xcite .",
    "a basic assumption employed in most of these models is that individuals tend to mimic others opinions .",
    "then , all the individuals would eventually select the same opinion , i.e. , consensus is reached .",
    "consensus is the expected outcome in , for example , the voter model in finite populations and some infinite networks @xcite , and majority vote models in which individuals tend to adopt the majority s opinion @xcite .",
    "however , in real society , pure consensus seems to be an exception rather than a norm @xcite . in meanfield populations ,",
    "idiosyncratic preferences of individuals @xcite and contrarians @xcite are among two driving forces to prevent consensus",

    "nonlinear opinion formation models with contrarians have been shown to exhibit phase transition between a consensus - like phase and an egalitarian phase @xcite . in the consensus - like phase",
    ", a majority of individuals takes one of the two opinions .",
    "the egalitarian phase is characterized by a more equal proportions of individuals with different opinions and facilitated by the existence of contrarian agents or behavior . a first customary approach to the understanding of such a model is to look at equilibrium properties , rather than dynamics , with analysis tools in statistical phyics @xcite .",
    "a complementary dynamical approach to opinion formation with contrarian agents was recently made with the use of coupled kuramoto oscillators with contrarian oscillators @xcite .",
    "however , agents in these studies are implicitly assumed to be intrinsic oscillators .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to link the dynamical results obtained from the oscillator model with contrarians to behavior of the spin - based models such as oscillatory dynamics observed in discrete - time models @xcite .",

    "contrarians oppose other agents such that they try to avoid others states .",

    "<S> congregators imitate the state of other agents with a rate that increases with the number of other agents in the opposite state , as in the linear voter model and nonlinear majority voting models . </S>",
    "<S> contrarians flip the state with a rate that increases with the number of other agents in the same state . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinearity controls the strength of the majority voting and is used as a main bifurcation parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the model undergoes a rich bifurcation scenario comprising the egalitarian equilibrium , two symmetric lopsided equilibria , limit cycle , and coexistence of different types of stable equilibria with intertwining attrative basins . </S>"
