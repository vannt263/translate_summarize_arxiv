    "with the highly anticipated run of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern we will begin to explore the terascale in earnest .",
    "there are very sound reasons to expect momentous discoveries at the lhc . among the greatest mysteries in particle physics today",
    "is the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking , which , according to the standard model , is accomplished through the higgs mechanism .",
    "the higgs particle is the primary target of the lhc experiments and , barring some unexpected behavior , the higgs boson will be firmly discovered after only a few years of running of the lhc . with some luck ,",
    "a higgs signal might start appearing already in the tevatron run ii .",
    "the discovery of a higgs boson , however , will open a host of new questions . as the first fundamental scalar to be seen",
    ", it will bring about a worrisome fine tuning problem : why is the higgs particle so light , compared to , say , the planck scale ?",
    "various solutions to this hierarchy problem have been proposed , and the most aesthetically pleasing one at this point appears to be low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) . in susy ,",
    "the problematic quadratic divergences in the radiative corrections to the higgs mass are absent , being canceled by loops with superpartners .",
    "the cancellations are enforced by the symmetry , and the higgs mass is therefore naturally related to the mass scale of the superpartners .    while the solution of the hierarchy problem is perhaps the most celebrated virtue of susy , supersymmetric models have other side benefits .",
    "for one , if the superpartners are indeed within the tev range , they would modify the running of the gauge couplings at higher scales , and gauge coupling unification takes place with astonishing precision .",
    "secondly , a large class of susy models , which have a conserved discrete symmetry ( @xmath3-parity ) , contain an excellent dark matter candidate : the lightest neutralino @xmath4 .",
    "one should keep in mind that the dark matter problem is by far the most compelling _ experimental _ evidence for particles and interactions outside the standard model ( sm ) , and provides a completely independent motivation for entertaining supersymmetry at the tev scale .",
    "finally , @xmath3-parity implies that superpartners interact only pairwise with sm particles , which guarantees that the supersymmetric contributions to low energy precision data only appear at the loop level and are small . in summary ,",
    "supersymmetric extensions of the sm are the primary candidates for new physics at the tev scale .",
    "not surprisingly , therefore , the signatures of supersymmetry at the tevatron and lhc have been extensively discussed in the literature . in typical scenarios with superpartners in the range of a few tev or less , already within the first few years of running the lhc",
    "will discover a signal of new physics in several channels .",
    "once such a signal of physics beyond the standard model is seen , it will immediately bring up the question : is it supersymmetry or not ?",
    "the answer to this question can be approached in two different ways . on the theoretical side ,",
    "one may ask whether there are well motivated alternatives to low energy supersymmetry , which would give similar signatures at hadron colliders , in other words , if the new physics is not supersymmetry , what else can it be ? until recently , there were no known examples of other types of new physics , which could `` fake '' supersymmetry sufficiently well .",
    "the signatures of supersymmetry and its competitors ( technicolor , new gauge bosons , large extra dimensions , etc . ) were sufficiently distinctive , and there was little room for confusion .",
    "however , it was recently realized that the framework of universal extra dimensions ( ued ) , originally proposed in  @xcite , can very effectively masquerade as low energy supersymmetry at a hadron collider such as the lhc or the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "it therefore became of sufficient interest to try and prove supersymmetry at the lhc from first principles , without resorting to model - dependent assumptions and without theoretical bias .",
    "the experimental program for proving supersymmetry at a _",
    "collider has been outlined a long time ago  @xcite and can be readily followed to make the discrimination between susy and ued  @xcite . however , as we shall see below , the case of hadron colliders is much more challenging .",
    "the more direct approach to confirming supersymmetry at the lhc would be to first ask : what are the defining features of supersymmetry , and can we prove them from the data ?",
    "by now there is a wide variety of supersymmetric models , with very diverse phenomenology .",
    "nevertheless , they all share the following common features which define a supersymmetric framework :    1 .   for each particle of the standard model ,",
    "supersymmetry predicts a new particle ( superpartner ) .",
    "the spins of the superpartners differ by @xmath5 unit .",
    "the couplings of the particles and their superpartners are equal , being related by supersymmetry .",
    "if supersymmetry were exact , one would have another common feature : the prediction that the masses of the particles and their superpartners must be equal as well .",
    "however , once susy is broken ( as it must be ) , the superpartner masses are lifted and one obtains spectra classified by the mechanism of susy breaking : supergravity - mediated , gauge - mediated , gaugino - mediated , anomaly - mediated etc .",
    "( for a recent review , see  @xcite ) . as a result , in realistic models of low - energy supersymmetry",
    "the pattern of sparticle masses is very model - dependent .",
    "the measurements of the superpartner masses are therefore probing susy _ breaking _ phenomena rather than a fundamental property of supersymmetry itself .    in the following let us only concentrate on susy models which possess a weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp ) as a dark matter candidate , as guaranteed by @xmath3-parity conservation .",
    "this will be in fact the most difficult case for establishing supersymmetry at a hadron collider .",
    "due to @xmath3-parity , the superpartners are pair - produced , and each one decays to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , in this case @xmath4 . since the two @xmath4s leave the detector without any interaction , the generic susy signal at the lhc is missing energy . with these assumptions",
    ", we can add another identifying feature to the list above , although this is not required by supersymmetry itself :    1 .",
    "the generic collider signature of supersymmetric models with wimp lsps is missing energy .",
    "this last property makes exact reconstruction of the event kinematics practically impossible . at a hadron collider ,",
    "the center of mass energy is not known on an event per event basis .",
    "in addition , the momenta of _ both _",
    "@xmath4 particles are unknown , and what is measured is only the transverse component of the sum of their momenta , provided there are no other sources of missing energy in the event ( such as neutrinos , @xmath6-jets , @xmath7-jets , etc . ) .",
    "as we shall see below , this incomplete information is the main stumbling block in proving the basic properties of supersymmetry at the lhc .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the prospects for establishing supersymmetry at the lhc by discriminating it from its look - alike scenario of universal extra dimensions . in section  [ sec : ued ]",
    "we review the basic phenomenology of the ued model , contrasting it with a generic supersymmetric model as described above .",
    "we identify two basic discriminators between the two scenarios and proceed to consider each one in turn in the following two sections .",
    "one of the characteristic features of extra dimensional models is the presence of a whole tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) partners , labelled by their kk level @xmath8 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath9 supersymmetry predicts a single superpartner for each sm particle .",
    "one might therefore hope to discover the higher kk modes of ued and thus prove the existence of extra dimensions . in section  [ sec : level2 ]",
    "we study the discovery reach for level 2 kk gauge boson particles and the resolving power of the lhc to see them as separate resonances .",
    "the other fundamental difference between susy and ued is the spin of the superpartners ( kk partners ) . in section  [ sec : spin ]",
    "we study how well the two models can be distinguished based on spin correlations in the cascade decays of the new particles .",
    "in particular , we use the asymmetry variable recently advertised by barr  @xcite for this purpose . ] .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "models of ued place all standard model particles in the bulk of one or more compactified extra dimensions . in the simplest and most popular version",
    ", there is a single extra dimension of size @xmath3 , compactified on an @xmath10 orbifold  @xcite .",
    "more complicated 6-dimensional models have also been built  @xcite .",
    "the ued framework has been a fruitful playground for addressing different puzzles of the standard model , such as electroweak symmetry breaking and vacuum stability  @xcite , neutrino masses  @xcite , proton stability  @xcite or the number of generations  @xcite .",
    "a peculiar feature of ued is the conservation of kaluza - klein number at tree level , which is a simple consequence of momentum conservation along the extra dimension .",
    "however , bulk and brane radiative effects @xcite break kk number down to a discrete conserved quantity , the so called kk parity , @xmath11 , where @xmath8 is the kk level .",
    "kk parity ensures that the lightest kk partners ( those at level one ) are always pair - produced in collider experiments , just like in the @xmath3-parity conserving supersymmetry models discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "kk parity conservation also implies that the contributions to various low - energy observables @xcite only arise at loop level and are small . as a result ,",
    "the limits on the scale @xmath12 of the extra dimension from precision electroweak data are rather weak , constraining @xmath12 to be larger than approximately 250  gev @xcite .",
    "an attractive feature of ued models with kk parity is the presence of a stable massive particle which can be a cold dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "the lightest kk partner ( lkp ) at level one is also the lightest particle with negative kk parity and is stable on cosmological scales .",
    "the identity of the lkp is a delicate issue , however , as it depends on the interplay between the one - loop radiative corrections to the kk mass spectrum and the brane terms generated by unknown physics at high scales  @xcite . in the minimal ued model defined below , the lkp turns out to be the kk partner @xmath13 of the hypercharge gauge boson @xcite and its relic density is typically in the right ballpark : in order to explain all of the dark matter , the @xmath13 mass should be in the range 500 - 600 gev  @xcite .",
    "kaluza - klein dark matter offers excellent prospects for direct  @xcite or indirect detection  @xcite .",
    "once the radiative corrections to the kaluza - klein masses are properly taken into account , the collider phenomenology of the minimal ued model exhibits striking similarities to supersymmetry @xcite and represents an interesting and well motivated counterexample which can `` fake '' supersymmetry signals at the lhc .    for the purposes of our study we have chosen to work with the minimal ued model considered in  @xcite . in ued",
    "the bulk interactions of the kk modes are fixed by the sm lagrangian and contain no unknown parameters other than the mass , @xmath14 , of the sm higgs boson .",
    "in contrast , the boundary interactions , which are localized on the orbifold fixed points , are in principle arbitrary , and their coefficients represent new free parameters in the theory .",
    "since the boundary terms are renormalized by bulk interactions , they are scale dependent @xcite and can not be completely ignored since they will be generated by renormalization effects .",
    "therefore , one needs an ansatz for their values at a particular scale . like any higher dimensional kaluza - klein theory ,",
    "the ued model should be treated only as an effective theory valid up to some high scale @xmath15 , at which it matches to some more fundamental theory .",
    "the minimal ued model is then defined so that the coefficients of all boundary interactions vanish at this matching scale @xmath15 , but are subsequently generated through rge evolution to lower scales .",
    "the minimal ued model therefore has only two input parameters : the size of the extra dimension , @xmath3 , and the cutoff scale , @xmath15 .",
    "the number of kk levels present in the effective theory is simply @xmath16 and may vary between a few and @xmath17 , where the upper limit comes from the breakdown of perturbativity already below the scale @xmath15 .",
    "unless specified otherwise , for our numerical results below , we shall always choose the value of @xmath15 so that @xmath18 .",
    "changing the value of @xmath15 will have very little impact on our results since the @xmath15 dependence of the kk mass spectrum is only logarithmic .",
    "and @xmath19 kk levels in minimal ued , for @xmath20 gev , @xmath18 and @xmath21 gev .",
    "we show the kk modes of gauge bosons , higgs and goldstone bosons and first generation fermions .",
    "[ fig : spectrum],width=377 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] we show the mass spectrum of the @xmath22 and @xmath19 kk levels in minimal ued , for @xmath20 gev , @xmath18 and sm higgs boson mass @xmath21 gev .",
    "we include the full one - loop corrections from @xcite .",
    "we have used rge improved couplings to compute the radiative corrections to the kk masses .",
    "it is well known that in ued the kk modes modify the running of the coupling constants at higher scales .",
    "we extrapolate the gauge coupling constants to the scale of the @xmath22 and @xmath19 kk modes , using the appropriate @xmath23 functions dictated by the particle spectrum  @xcite . as a result",
    "the spectrum shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] differs slightly from the one in @xcite .",
    "most notably , the colored kk particles are somewhat lighter , due to a reduced value of the strong coupling constant , and overall the kk spectrum at each level is more degenerate .",
    "we are now in a position to compare in general terms the phenomenology of ued and supersymmetry at colliders . in section",
    "[ sec : intro ] we outlined four identifying features of susy models with wimp lsps . in complete analogy",
    ", the discussion of section  [ sec : mued ] leads to the following generic features of ued :    1 .   for each particle of the standard model ,",
    "ued models predict an infinite , see section  [ sec : mued ] .",
    "] tower of new particles ( kaluza - klein partners ) .",
    "2 .   the spins of the sm particles and their kk partners are the same .",
    "3 .   the couplings of the sm particles and their kk partners are equal .",
    "the generic collider signature of ued models with wimp lkps is missing energy .",
    "notice that the defining features 3 and 4 are common to both supersymmetry and ued and can not be used to distinguish the two cases .",
    "we see that while @xmath3-parity conserving susy implies a missing energy signal , the reverse is not true : a missing energy signal would appear in any model with a dark matter candidate , and even in models which have nothing to do with the dark matter issue , but simply contain new neutral quasi - stable particles , e.g.  gravitons  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the equality of the couplings ( feature no .",
    "3 ) is a celebrated test of susy , but from the above comparison we see that it is only a necessary , but not a sufficient condition in proving supersymmetry .",
    "in addition , the measurement of superpartner couplings in order to test the susy relations is a very challenging task at a hadron collider .",
    "for one , the observed production rate in any given channel is only sensitive to the product of the cross - section times the branching fractions , and so any attempt to measure the couplings from a cross - section would have to make certain assumptions about the branching fractions .",
    "an additional complication arises from the fact that at hadron colliders all kinematically available states can be produced simultaneously , and the production of a particular species in an exclusive channel is rather difficult to isolate .",
    "the couplings could also in principle be measured from the branching fractions , but that also requires a measurement of the total width , which is impossible in our case , since the breit - wigner resonance can not be reconstructed , due to the unknown momentum of the missing lsp ( lkp ) .",
    "we are therefore forced to concentrate on the first two identifying features as the only promising discriminating criteria .",
    "let us begin with feature 1 : the number of new particles .",
    "the kk particles at @xmath22 are analogous to superpartners in supersymmetry .",
    "however , the particles at the higher kk levels have no analogues in @xmath9 supersymmetric models . discovering the @xmath24 levels of the kk tower",
    "would therefore indicate the presence of extra dimensions rather than susy . in this study",
    "we shall concentrate on the @xmath19 level and in section  [ sec : level2 ] we investigate the discovery opportunities at the lhc and the tevatron ( for linear collider studies of @xmath19 kk gauge bosons , see @xcite ) .",
    "notice that the masses of the kk modes are given roughly by @xmath25 , where @xmath8 is the kk level number , so that the particles at levels 3 and higher are rather heavy and their production is severely suppressed .",
    "the second identifying feature  the spins of the new particles  also provides a tool for discrimination between susy and ued : the kk partners have identical spin quantum numbers as their sm counterparts , while the spins of the superpartners differ by @xmath5 unit . however , spin determinations are known to be difficult at the lhc ( or at hadron colliders in general ) , where the parton - level center of mass energy @xmath26 in each event is unknown .",
    "in addition , the momenta of the two dark matter candidates in the event are also unknown .",
    "this prevents the reconstruction of any rest frame angular decay distributions , or the directions of the two particles at the top of the decay chains .",
    "the variable @xmath26 also rules out the possibility of a threshold scan , which is one of the main tools for determining particle spins at lepton colliders .",
    "we are therefore forced to look for new methods for spin determinations , or at least for finding spin correlations the flat energy distribution of the observable final state particles ( muons in this case ) is often regarded as a smoking gun for the scalar nature of the intermediate particles ( the smuons ) .",
    "indeed , the smuons are spin zero particles and decay isotropically in their rest frame , which results in a flat distribution in the lab frame .",
    "however , the flat distribution is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a scalar particle , and ued provides a counterexample with the analogous process of kk muon production  @xcite , where a flat distribution also appears , but as a result of equal contributions from left - handed and right - handed kk fermions . ] .",
    "recently it has been suggested that a charge asymmetry in the lepton - jet invariant mass distributions from a particular cascade , can be used to discriminate susy from the case of pure phase space decays  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of discriminating susy and ued by this method will be the subject of section  [ sec : spin ] ( see also  @xcite and  @xcite ) .    for the purposes of our study",
    "we have implemented the relevant features of the minimal ued model in the comphep event generator @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) is already available in comphep since version  41.10 .",
    "we incorporated all @xmath22 and @xmath19 kk modes as new particles , with the proper interactions , widths , and one - loop corrected masses  @xcite .",
    "similar to the sm case , the neutral gauge bosons at level  1 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , are mixtures of the kk modes of the hypercharge gauge boson and the neutral @xmath29 gauge boson . however , as shown in  @xcite , the radiatively corrected weinberg angle at level  1 and higher is very small .",
    "for example , @xmath28 , which is the lkp in the minimal ued model , is mostly the kk mode of the hypercharge gauge boson . for simplicity , in the code we neglected neutral gauge boson mixing for @xmath30 .",
    "in this section we shall consider the prospects for discovery of level 2 kaluza - klein particles in ued .",
    "our notation and conventions follow those of ref .",
    "for example , @xmath29-doublet ( @xmath29-singlet ) kk fermions are denoted by capital ( lowercase ) letters . the kk level @xmath8 is denoted by a subscript .",
    "we begin our discussion with the @xmath19 kk fermions .",
    "since the kk mass spectrum is pretty degenerate , the production cross - sections at the lhc are mostly determined by the strength of the kk particle interactions with the proton constituents .",
    "as kk quarks carry color , we expect their production rates to be much higher than those of kk leptons .",
    "we shall therefore concentrate on the case of kk quarks only .",
    "kk particles at the lhc : ( a ) kk - quark pair production ; ( b ) kk - quark / kk - gluon associated production and kk - gluon pair production .",
    "the cross - sections have been summed over all quark flavors and also include charge - conjugated contributions such as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , etc .",
    "[ fig : sigma_q2g2],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]   kk particles at the lhc : ( a ) kk - quark pair production ; ( b ) kk - quark / kk - gluon associated production and kk - gluon pair production .",

    "[ fig : sigma_q2g2],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    in principle , there are two mechanisms for producing @xmath19 kk quarks at the lhc : through kk - number conserving interactions , or through kk - number violating ( but kk - parity conserving ) interactions . the kk number conserving qcd interactions allow production of kk",
    "quarks either in pairs or singly ( in association with the @xmath19 kk mode of a gauge boson ) .",
    "the corresponding production cross - sections are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_q2g2 ] ( the cross - sections for producing @xmath22 kk quarks have been calculated in  @xcite ) . in fig .",

    "[ fig : sigma_q2g2]b we show the results for @xmath19 kk - quark / kk - gluon associated production and for @xmath19 kk - gluon pair production .",
    "we plot the results versus @xmath12 , and one should keep in mind that the masses of the @xmath19 particles are roughly @xmath34 . in calculating the cross - sections of fig .  [",
    "fig : sigma_q2g2 ] we consider 5 partonic quark flavors in the proton along with the gluon .",
    "we sum over the final state quark flavors and include charge - conjugated contributions .",
    "we used cteq5l parton distributions @xcite and choose the scale of the strong coupling constant @xmath35 to be equal to the parton level center of mass energy .",
    "all calculations are done with comphep  @xcite with our implementation of the minimal ued model .",
    "several comments are in order .",
    "first , fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_q2g2 ] displays a severe kinematic suppression of the cross - sections at large kk masses .",
    "this is familiar from the case of susy , where the ultimate lhc reach for colored superpartners extends only to about 3 tev .",
    "notice the different mass dependence of the cross - sections for the three types of final states with @xmath19 particles : quark - quark , quark - gluon , and gluon - gluon .",
    "this can be easily understood in terms of the structure functions of the quarks and gluon inside the proton .",
    "we also observe minor differences in the cross - sections for pair production of kk quarks with different @xmath29 quantum numbers .",
    "this is partially due to the different masses for @xmath29-doublet and @xmath29-singlet quarks ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ) , and the remaining difference is due to the contributions from diagrams with electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "notice that since the cross - sections in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_q2g2]a are summed over charge conjugated final states , the mixed case of @xmath36 contains twice as many quark - antiquark contributions ( compare @xmath37 to @xmath38 or @xmath39 alone ) .",
    "if we compare the cross - sections for @xmath19 kk quark production to the cross - sections for producing squarks of similar masses in susy , we realize that the production rates are higher in ued .",
    "this is due to several reasons .",
    "consider , for example , @xmath40-channel processes .",
    "well above threshold , the ued cross - sections are larger by a factor of 4  @xcite",
    ". one factor of 2 is due to the fact that in ued the particle content at @xmath30 is duplicated  for example , there are both left - handed and right - handed @xmath29-doublet kk fermions , while in susy there are only `` left - handed '' @xmath29-doublet squarks .",
    "another factor of 2 comes from the different angular distribution for fermions , @xmath41 , versus scalars , @xmath42 .",
    "when integrated over all angles , this accounts for the second factor of 2 difference .",
    "furthermore , at the lhc new heavy particles are produced close to threshold , due to the steeply falling parton luminosities . in susy ,",
    "the new particles ( squarks ) are scalars , and the threshold suppression of the cross - sections is @xmath43 , while in ued the kk - quarks are fermions , and the threshold suppression of the cross - section is only @xmath23 .",
    "this distinct threshold behavior of the production cross - sections further enhances the difference between susy and ued .",
    "for example , we find that for @xmath20 gev the pair production cross - section for charm kk - quarks is about 6 times larger than the cross - section for charm squarks . for processes involving first generation kk - quarks , where @xmath44-channel diagrams contribute significantly",
    ", the effect can be even bigger .",
    "for example , up kk - quark production and up squark production differ by about factor of 8 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma_q2g2 ] we have only considered production due to kk number conserving bulk interactions .",
    "the main advantage of those processes is that the corresponding couplings are unsuppressed .",
    "however , the disadvantage is that we need to produce _ two _ heavy particles , each of mass @xmath45 , which leads to a kinematic suppression . in order to overcome this problem",
    ", one could in principle consider the single production of @xmath19 kk quarks through kk number violating , but kk parity conserving interactions , for example @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a sm gauge field and @xmath48 is the corresponding group generator . however , ( [ q2q0a0 ] ) is forbidden by gauge invariance , and the lowest order coupling of an @xmath19 kk quark to two sm particles has the form @xcite @xmath49 such operators may in principle be present , as they may be generated at the scale @xmath15 by the unknown physics at higher scales .",
    "however , being higher dimensional , we expect them to be suppressed at least by @xmath50 , hence in our subsequent analysis we shall neglect them .    ; for ( a ) the @xmath29-doublet quark @xmath51 and ( b ) the @xmath29-singlet quark @xmath52 .",
    "[ fig : br_q2],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] ; for ( a ) the @xmath29-doublet quark @xmath51 and ( b ) the @xmath29-singlet quark @xmath52 .",
    "[ fig : br_q2],title=\"fig:\",width=302 ]    having determined the production rates of level 2 kk quarks , we now turn to the discussion of their experimental signatures . to this end",
    "we need to determine the possible decay modes of @xmath53 and @xmath54 . at each level @xmath8 ,",
    "the kk quarks are among the heaviest states in the kk spectrum and can decay promptly to lighter kk modes ( this is true for the top kk modes  @xcite as well ) . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] , the kk gluon is always heavier than the kk quarks , so the two body decays of kk quarks to kk gluons are closed .",
    "instead , @xmath19 kk quarks will decay to the kk modes of the electroweak gauge bosons which are lighter .",
    "the branching fractions for @xmath19 `` up''-type kk quarks are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : br_q2 ] . fig .  [ fig : br_q2]a ( fig .",
    "[ fig : br_q2]b ) is for the case of the @xmath29-doublet quark @xmath51 ( the @xmath29-singlet quark @xmath52 ) .",
    "the results for the `` down''-type kk quarks are similar .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : br_q2 ] that the branching fractions are almost independent of @xmath12 , unless one is close to threshold .",
    "this feature will persist for all branching ratios of kk particles which will be shown later .",
    "once we ignore the kk number violating coupling ( [ q2q0a0hd ] ) , only decays which conserve the total kk number @xmath8 are allowed .",
    "the case of the @xmath29-singlet quarks such as @xmath52 is simpler , since they only couple to the hypercharge gauge bosons .",
    "recall that at @xmath55 the hypercharge component is almost entirely contained in the @xmath56 kk mode  @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect a singlet kk quark @xmath54 to decay to either @xmath57 or @xmath58 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : br_q2]b .",
    "the case of an @xmath29-doublet quark @xmath53 is much more complicated , since @xmath53 couples to the ( kk modes of the ) weak gauge bosons as well , and many more two - body final states are possible .",
    "since the weak coupling is larger than the hypercharge coupling , the decays to @xmath59 and @xmath60 kk modes dominate , with @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as evidenced in fig .",

    "the spin correlations are encoded in the charge asymmetry  @xcite @xmath153 where @xmath154 stands for both a quark and an antiquark , and @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) is the number of entries with positively ( negatively ) charged lepton .",

    "notice that we have not included detector effects or backgrounds .",
    "finally , and perhaps most importantly , this analysis ignores the combinatorial background from the other jets in the event , which could be misinterpreted as the starting point of the cascade depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagrams ] .",
    "overall , fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetry ] shows that although the asymmetry ( [ asymmetry ] ) does encode some spin correlations , distinguishing between the specific cases of ued and susy appears challenging .",
    "these results have been recently confirmed in  @xcite , where in addition the authors considered a study point with larger mass splittings , as expected in typical susy models . under those circumstances the asymmetry distributions appear to be more distinct than the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : asymmetry ] , which is a source of optimism .",
    "it remains to be seen whether this conclusion persists in a general setting , and once the combinatorial backgrounds are included  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the differences and similarities in the hadron collider phenomenology of models with universal extra dimensions and supersymmetry .",
    "we identified the higher level kk modes of ued and the spin quantum numbers of the new particles as the only two reliable discriminators between the two scenarios .",
    "we then proceeded to study the discovery reach for level 2 kk modes in ued at hadron colliders .",
    "we showed that the @xmath19 kk gauge bosons offer the best prospects for detection , in particular the @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances can be _ separately _ discovered at the lhc .",
    "is this a proof of ued ?",
    "not quite  these resonances could still be interpreted as @xmath78 gauge bosons , but their close degeneracy is a smoking gun for ued .",
    "furthermore , although we did not show any results to this effect in this paper , it is clear that the @xmath158 kk mode can also be looked for and discovered in its decay to sm leptons .",
    "one can then measure @xmath159 and show that it is very close to @xmath160 and @xmath161 , which would further strengthen the case for ued .",
    "unfortunately , the spin discrimination is not so straightforward , and requires further studies .",
    "the asymmetry method of barr seems to fail as a universal discriminator between susy and ued , although it rules out the absence of any spin correlations .",
    "while in this paper we only concentrated on the minimal ued model , it should be kept in mind that there are many interesting possibilities for extending the analysis to a more general setup .",
    "for example , non - vanishing boundary terms at the scale @xmath15 can distort the minimal ued spectrum beyond recognition . a priori , in such a relaxed framework",
    "the ued - susy confusion can be `` complete '' in the context of a hadron collider and a preliminary study is under way to address this issue  @xcite .",
    "the ued collider phenomenology is also very different in the case of a `` fat '' brane  @xcite , charged lkps  @xcite or kk graviton superwimps @xcite .",
