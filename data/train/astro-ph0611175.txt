    "[ fig : sed ] clearly shows that the hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray spectrum of 4u0142 + 61 has to break between @xmath1 200 kev and 750 kev in order not to be in conflict with the comptel upper limits . if we were to assume that by chance 4u0142 + 61 was in a low state at mev energies during the long comptel observations , it would be remarkable that also for the other axps detected similarly by integral ( 1e 1841 - 045 and 1rxs j1708 - 4009 ) no signal was found at mev energies during the many observations that they were in the comptel field - of - view spread over 10 years @xcite .",

    ". the extrapolation of the hard x - ray spectral fit towards lower energies is already five times lower at 6 kev than measured with swift .",

    "it was noted earlier ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that extrapolations of fits to the soft x - ray spectra to the optical and nir bands are not consistent with the measured variable flux values .",
    "this is more than evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] , where we show the extrapolation of the double black - body fit , which reaches optical and nir fluxes @xmath145 orders of magnitude lower than the measured values .",

    "however , fig .",
    "[ fig : sed ] unambiguously shows that also extrapolation of the power - law spectral shape measured at hard x - ray energies passes 23 orders of magnitude underneath the optical and nir data points .",
    "the hard x - ray , soft x - ray , optical and nir components seem to have different origins .",
    "the discovery of the hard x - ray spectra of axps , stimulated new attempts to search for non - thermal radio emission possibly originating from the same sites and/or production mechanisms ( e.g. synchrotron radiation ) in the magnetar s magnetosphere .",
    "the wsrt upper limits at 1380 mhz are however not constraining in this respect .",

    "assuming a distance of 3.6 kpc as recently determined by durant & van kerkwijk ( 2006a ) , the 20230 kev flux ( sect .

    "[ sec : swift ] ) .    over the last two years theoretical attempts have been made trying to explain the new hard x - ray emission above 10 kev from axps .",
    "a particularly interesting interpretation of the high - energy emission is the application of a magnetar - corona model by thompson & beloborodov ( 2005 ) and beloborodov & thompson ( 2006a , b in this volume ) . in the last papers ,",
    "a theoretical model is developed explaining the formation of a hot corona above the surface of a magnetar , so far the only model attempting to explain the multi - wavelength emission .",
    "in essence , the twisted magnetosphere acts as an accelerator that converts the toroidal - field energy to particle kinetic energy .",
    "they show numerically that the corona self organises quickly into a quasi - steady state , with a voltage of @xmath11 gev along the magnetic field lines .",
    "pair production occurs at a rate just enough to feed the electric current .",
    "interestingly , the heating rate of the corona is @xmath1@xmath57@xmath58 , in agreement with the observed persistent , high - energy output of magnetars .",
    "furthermore , they deduce that the static twist will decay on a timescale of 110 years , setting the scale for time variability to look for in the high - energy emission . the transition layer between the atmosphere and the corona is the likely source of the observed @xmath1100 kev ( e.g. bremsstrahlung ) emission from magnetars .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the corona emits curvature radiation which can also supply the observed ir - optical luminosity . of particular concern in the hot coronae model is the reported timescale of 110 years . for 4u 0142 + 61",
    "we do not see evidence for strong variability in the hard x - ray emission over the first years of integral observations , nor over the longer period of rxte monitoring observations .",

    "obviously , as much integral data as possible will be collected on 4u  0142 + 61 and the other hard x - ray emitting axps to search for the break energy in the total spectrum , a key parameter in the discrimination between the different proposed models .",

    "<S> for the first time a quasi - simultaneous multi - wavelength campaign has been performed on an anomalous x - ray pulsar from the radio to the hard x - ray band . </S>",
    "<S> 4u  0142 + 61 was an integral target for 1 ms in july 2005 . during these observations </S>",
    "<S> it was also observed in the x - ray band with swift and rxte , in the optical and nir with gemini north and in the radio with the wsrt . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present the source - energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the spectral results obtained in the individual wave bands do not connect smoothly ; apparently components of different origin contribute to the total spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> remarkable is that the integral hard x - ray spectrum ( power - law index @xmath0 ) is now measured up to an energy of @xmath1230 kev with no indication of a spectral break . </S>",
    "<S> extrapolation of the integral power - law spectrum to lower energies passes orders of magnitude underneath the nir and optical fluxes , as well as the low @xmath130 @xmath2jy ( 2@xmath3 ) upper limit in the radio band . </S>"
