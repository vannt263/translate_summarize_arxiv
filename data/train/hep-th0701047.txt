    "the physics of strong electromagnetic fields , in particular vacuum polarization and pair production , has been studied by sauter @xcite , heisenberg and euler @xcite , and weisskopf @xcite even before the advent of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) . using the proper - time path integral , schwinger obtained the one - loop qed effective action in a constant electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "the imaginary part of the effective action under the influence of electric fields leads to the decay rate of the vacuum and thereby the pair - production rate of charged particles .",
    "( for a recent review and references on qed and pair production , see @xcite . )",
    "one approach to pair production is tunneling of virtual pairs from the dirac sea @xcite , in which instantons determine the tunneling probability and thereby the pair - production rate .",

    "also ultrahigh intense lasers have been developed using a technique of amplifying pulses of picosecond and few femtosecond time scales ( for a review and references , see @xcite ) .",
    "the focal region of colliding lasers may correspond to a strong qed regime , in which not only vacuum polarization but also pair production can be tested @xcite ( see also @xcite for other qed related physics ) . the localized beam in space and time",
    "does necessarily imply inhomogeneous electromagnetic fields .",
    "thus pair production of charged particles by inhomogeneous electric fields is not only a theoretical issue but also an experimental concern .    in previous papers @xcite",
    ", we formulated the pair - production rate of charged particles in inhomogeneous electric electric fields in terms of the instantons for tunneling states in the space - dependent ( coulomb ) gauge , and worked out explicitly the rate for the sauter electric field @xcite in the wkb approximation . recently , using the worldline path integral , dunne and schubert @xcite obtained worldline instantons in a gauge - independent way , and dunne , wang , gies and schubert @xcite further found the prefactor to the worldline instantons to calculate the pair - production rate by inhomogeneous fields .    in this paper , using the phase - integral method @xcite , we further elaborate the instanton method of refs . @xcite by defining the instanton action in a gauge - independent way as a contour integral in the complex space or time plane .",
    "the divergence problem at turning points in the wkb method can be naturally avoided by the contour integral excluding the branch cut connecting two complex roots corresponding to turning points .",
    "we use the new instanton method to calculate the leading - order ( lo ) and next - to - leading - order ( nlo ) wkb instanton actions both in a spatially localized electric field @xmath3 and in a temporally localized electric field @xmath4 of sauter type @xcite , and then obtain the pair - production rate for charged fermions .",

    "@xcite , and that the gaussian approximation for the integrals over @xmath7 and @xmath8 in our approach using @xmath9 gives the same pair - production rate , including the prefactor @xcite , as the worldline instanton method .",
    "we further calculate the nlo wkb actions @xmath10 in spinor qed and show that the sum of the wkb and nlo instanton actions in spinor qed is equal to the wkb instanton action in scalar qed .",
    "finally we study pair production in the sauter electric field together with a constant magnetic field in the same direction .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we reformulate the instanton method in a gauge - independent way in the complex plane of space or time .",
    "we also show that the terms in the wkb approximation for a constant electric field vanish beyond the leading order , and the wkb approximation thus reproduces the well - known exact one - loop result from the point of view of the instanton method . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate within the leading - order wkb approximation the instanton actions in scalar qed for a localized electric field of spatial or temporal sauter - type and obtain the pair - production rate for both cases . we find that the wkb instanton action in scalar qed gives a pair - production rate closer to the exact result for spinor qed up to higher order in an adiabaticity parameter . in sec .",
    "iv , we calculate the wkb and nlo instanton actions in spinor qed and find that the instanton action up through the nlo contribution for each frequency and transverse momentum equals the wkb instanton action in scalar qed , thus justifying the reason why the wkb instanton action in scalar qed gives a good result . in sec .",
    "v , we find the wkb instanton action in the sauter electric field together with a constant magnetic field in the same direction .",
    "the worldline instanton method is based on feynman s worldline path integral @xcite , manifestly a gauge invariant formalism , and calculates the instanton action from a closed instanton trajectory @xcite .",
    "affleck , alvarez and manton found the instanton action in a constant electric field from the closed instanton trajectory @xcite . in this paper",

    "<S> it is further shown that the wkb instanton action plus the next - to - leading order contribution in spinor qed equals the wkb instanton action in scalar qed , thus justifying why the wkb instanton in scalar qed can work for the pair production of fermions . </S>",
    "<S> finally we obtain the pair - production rate in a spatially localized electric field together with a constant magnetic field in the same direction . </S>"
