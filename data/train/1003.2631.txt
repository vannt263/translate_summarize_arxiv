    "many cluster - specific environmental processes , such as ram - pressure stripping @xcite , strangulation@xcite , galaxy - galaxy harassment @xcite , or tidal disruption @xcite have been proposed to explain the effects of cluster assembly on the galaxy population . however , the picture of galaxies being accreted in a static cluster environment is overly simplistic .",
    "many optical and x - ray studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "must be taken into account .",
    "for instance , the predominance of passively evolving galaxies in clusters was suggested to have its roots in the preprocessing of galaxies in the group environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , thus not being directly related to the much denser environment in clusters .",
    "although environment has thus been identified to play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies , the effect of events that cause the most dramatic change in environment , cluster mergers , is still poorly understood @xcite .",
    "for instance , it is still controversial whether star - formation activity would be enhanced during cluster mergers , as favored by numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "observationally , this picture is supported by the classical studies of @xcite and @xcite , which find evidence of recent star bursts in merging clusters .",
    "more recently , @xcite suggested that the excess of radio - loud galaxies around the cluster abell  2125 may be related to the ongoing cluster merger , and @xcite report on actively star - forming galaxies in the region between the two sub - clusters of the merging cluster abell  3921 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "in addition , @xcite compare the two merging clusters abell  168 and abell  1750 , and attribute the different amount of galaxy activity , including star formation and nuclear activity , in the region between the subclusters to the differences in the merger history of the two clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "the ages of numerous post - starburst galaxies found in abell  3921 are too old for the starbursts to have been triggered by the ongoing merger @xcite .",

    "* ) by @xcite suggests that most of the mid - infrared luminous galaxies are infalling and thus not related to the merging process .",
    "the cause of the conflicting observational evidence may lie in the complexity of the dynamics of cluster mergers . for instance , the specific phase in which a merger is observed , the viewing angle , and the relative masses of the subclusters can all be expected to have a direct effect on the triggering of star formation and the resulting spatial and spectral observational data ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . finding merging systems whose geometry and merger history are immediately evident is thus of paramount importance . to date",
