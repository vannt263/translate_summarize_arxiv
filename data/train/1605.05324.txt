    "the very high @xmath2-ray flux state and the too observations provided a sufficiently large number of photons in each bin to resolve light curves with shorter timescales than the _ fermi _  orbital period .",

    "although defining the characteristic timescale of the variability is difficult , the flux doubling time is conservatively less than 10  min , and plausibly @xmath36 min or shorter .",
