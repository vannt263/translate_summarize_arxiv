    "there is compelling evidence that massive black holes ( mbhs ) of mass @xmath2 exist in the centers of most galaxies @xcite .",
    "the mbhs acquired most of their mass by efficient luminous accretion @xcite , which implies accretion from an optically thick , geometrically thin accretion disk @xcite . on larger spatial scales ,",
    "such disks may fragment and form stars on disk - like orbits @xcite , as observed in the galactic center @xcite and elsewhere @xcite .",
    "gas disks , often marginally stable and with properties similar to star disk progenitors @xcite , are detected in the radio by @xmath3 maser emission ( for a list of known circum - nuclear maser disks , see @xcite ; for more candidates , see @xcite ) .",
    "the interest in processes that affect accretion disks stems from the possible implications for mbh growth , for the luminosity evolution of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and for nuclear star formation .",
    "conversely , the disk properties may provide information about dynamical processes that operate very close to the mbh , and may be relevant for other phenomena there , such as tidal interactions with the mbh or the emission of gravitational waves ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "maser - emitting nuclear accretion disks are unique , clean probes of the near environment of mbhs .",
    "the first discovered and best studied maser disk , ngc4258 , is also the thinnest and most keplerian ( to better than @xmath4 , @xcite ) nuclear disk yet discovered .",
    "radio @xmath3 maser observations of the disk morphology , velocities and accelerations allow accurate measurements of the mbh mass and the distance to the host galaxy @xcite .",
    "together with optical and x - ray observations , these provide estimates the mass accretion rate through the disk @xcite .",
    "the ngc4258 maser disk shows a clear @xmath0 warp on the @xmath5 scale @xcite , whose origin is still a matter of debate .",
    "warps are possibly also observed in the maser disks of circinus @xcite and ngc 3393 @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed to explain the warped disk in ngc  4258 .",
    "the @xcite ( bp ) effect ( torquing of a viscous disk by the general relativistic frame - dragging ) can warp a disk that is initially misaligned with the mbh spin by dragging its inner regions to the mbh equatorial plane @xcite .",
    "instability of a thin disk to radiation pressure from the central source can result in the amplification of a small pre - existing warp @xcite .",
    "the disk s self - gravity can support equilibrium warped disk configurations @xcite , if these are excited by other means .",
    "one feature shared by these mechanisms is that they require some initial asymmetry in the disk or disk / mbh alignment for the warp to develop .",
    "here we consider the implications of the dense stellar cusp around the gas disk .",
    "various dynamical scenarios predict the formation of steep stellar density cusps @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) within the mbh radius of influence @xmath8 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the empirical @xmath9 correlation implies that the cusp density scales as @xmath10 , so that the relatively low - mass mbhs , where maser disks are found , are surrounded by a very dense stellar cusp @xcite .",
    "strong mass segregation ( @xcite ) further concentrates stellar - mass black holes ( sbhs ) to the center .",
    "the stars in the cusp move in a nearly spherical potential dominated by the mbh , and therefore orbit on nearly fixed planes .",
    "this symmetry leads to the rapid torquing of any test particle by the process of resonant relaxation ( rr ) ( @xcite ( rt96 ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , gas streams on circular orbits undergo `` vector rr '' , which changes the orbital plane , but not their eccentricity .",
    "rr thus induces warps by exchanging angular momentum between the stars and the disk .",
    "this _ letter _ is organized as follows .",
    "rr dynamics are summarized in  [ s : rrdyn ] .",
    "an analytical model for rr torquing of a disk is described in  [ s : rrdisk ] , and applied to the ngc4258 maser in  [ s : model ] .",
    "our results are presented in ",
    "[ s : results ] and summarized in  [ s : discuss ] .",
    "rr is a rapid relaxation mechanism of the angular momentum @xmath11 , which operates in near - symmetric potentials that suppress the evolution of the stellar orbits ( e.g. fixed ellipses in a kepler potential , or planar rosettes in a spherical potential ) . in such systems ,",
    "the residual torque on a test mass by the orbit - averaged mass distributions of @xmath12 stars of mass @xmath13 within distance @xmath14 from the center , @xmath15 , remains constant on timescales shorter than the coherence time @xmath16 , as long as perturbations due to deviations from the perfect symmetry remain small .",
    "the change in @xmath11 then grows coherently as @xmath17 on timescales @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the circular orbital period .",
    "when @xmath20 , the large accumulated change over the coherence time , @xmath21 , becomes the step size of a rapid random walk , @xmath22\\sqrt{t / t_{0}}\\!\\equiv\\!\\sqrt{t / t_{\\mathrm{rr}}}$ ] , where @xmath23 is the circular specific angular momentum for the test mass orbital energy , and @xmath24 is thereby defined as the rr timescale , when @xmath25 .",
    "the slower the loss of coherence ( `` quenching '' ) , the more efficient is rr ( shorter @xmath24 ) .",
    "rr can be orders of magnitude faster than non - coherent 2-body relaxation .    in a near - keplerian potential",
    "the orbits are nearly fixed ellipses , and the coherence time is set by the faster of general relativistic ( gr ) precession or precession by the potential of the enclosed stellar mass . in this case",
    "rr can change both the direction and magnitude of @xmath11 ( `` scalar rr '' ) .",
    "however , the torques along @xmath11 fall to zero for a test mass on a circular orbit @xcite , and so circular orbits , such as those of gas streams in an accretion disk , remain circular ( @xmath26 ) , but their orientation evolves rapidly ( @xmath27 , `` vector rr '' ) until rr itself randomizes the orbital planes to a degree where coherence is lost ( `` self - quenching '' ) .",
    "vector rr is not quenched by precession ( @xmath27 between orbit - averaged rosettes ) , and so it can operate both very near the mbh , where gr precession is fast , and far from the mbh where the potential is spherical but no longer keplerian .",
    "the coherence time for the self - quenched vector rr is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and where @xmath30 is an order unity factor . on timescales",
    "@xmath31 ,    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is an order - unity factor ( recent @xmath34-body simulations indicate that @xmath35 , @xcite ) .",
    "the vector rr timescale is then    @xmath36    for the purpose of numeric evaluation , we assume below @xmath37 . note that for vector rr , @xmath38 .    a change of @xmath39 in the angular momentum of a gas ring in an accretion disk ( `` warp factor '' @xmath40 ) , expressed by the change to the ring normal @xmath41 , corresponds to a warp inclination angle @xmath42 via @xmath43 , for @xmath44 , @xmath45 rad . by definition , @xmath46 ( @xmath47 ) over the vector rr timescale @xmath48 .",
    "rr warping by a factor @xmath49 occurs on a timescale shorter than the coherence time ( @xmath50 ) , and so the time required to develop such a small local warp inclination is @xmath51 .",
    "the residual rr torque @xmath52 changes gradually with @xmath14 , as the uncorrelated stars that effectively contribute to it vary .",
    "we estimate the rr spatial coherence factor @xmath53 as the distance ratio over which the enclosed stellar numbers satisfy @xmath54 , which translates to @xmath55 .",
    "the observed ngc4258 maser disk extends over @xmath56 , and the assumed @xmath57 stellar cusp there corresponds to @xmath58 (  [ s : model ] ) , which implies that the warping torques , and thus @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are approximately uncorrelated ( section [ s : model ] ) .",
    "the total observed warp angle @xmath61 is due to the difference between the local warp angles at the disk s inner and outer edges .",
    "the relative magnitude of the warp factors is related by eq .",
    "( [ e : tvrrlin ] ) , @xmath62 ( @xmath63 for @xmath64 ) . in the limit of small warp inclination angles",
    ", as is the case here , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . the maser disk in ngc  4258 displays a @xmath67 relative warp between the limits of the masing region at @xmath68 , @xmath69 @xcite , which after averaging over uncorrelated @xmath70 and @xmath71 , implies that locally , @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     [ s : rrdisk ]    the gas in a thin accretion disk flows slowly into the mbh on nearly circular orbits . over time , the orbit associated with a ring element of the disk shrinks , and the torques on it change .",
    "rr can significantly affect the ring only if the typical rr timescale , @xmath48 is shorter than the radial inflow timescale @xmath74 , which is set by the disk s tangential in - plane viscosity coefficient , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radius along the disk s mid - plane .",
    "the presence of a warp also induces a vertical shear viscosity @xmath77 , which resists the external torques by diffusing the warp on a timescale @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "effective warping thus also requires that @xmath48 be shorter than the warp diffusion timescale .",
    "in addition to these timescale constraints , the torquing stars must carry enough residual angular momentum to exchange with the disk and warp it .",
    "therefore , both a timescale condition (  [ ss : rrt ] ) and an angular momentum condition (  [ ss : rrl ] ) must be satisfied for rr torquing to occur .      the vector rr timescale ( eq .",
    "[ e : tvrr ] ) estimated above for stars enclosed within radius @xmath14 and acting on a mass orbiting at the same typical radius @xmath14 , can be easily generalized to a mass ( disk ring element ) at a different radius @xmath76 , by noting that @xmath48 scales with the torque as @xmath79 , and that the typical torque on the ring element is decreased by a factor @xmath80 when @xmath81 and by a factor @xmath82 when @xmath83 ,    @xmath84    where @xmath85 , and the last proportionality holds in the keplerian limit . in order to efficiently warp the disk by a factor @xmath40",
    ", @xmath86 must be shorter by at least some factor @xmath87 than the faster of the two viscous processes , @xmath88 ,    @xmath89    an equality in eq .",

    "@xmath90 for a given @xmath83 and a _ lower limit _",
    "@xmath91 for @xmath81 ( assuming @xmath92 ; recall that @xmath93 for realistic cusp models )    @xmath94^{1/(2\\theta+\\gamma/2)}\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath95 is the formally extrapolated number of stars within the last stable circular orbit @xmath96 , and @xmath97 is the formal keplerian orbital period there .",
    "when there exists a solution with @xmath98 , then stars in the volume @xmath99 induce fast enough vector rr on the disk at @xmath76 to warp it by a factor @xmath40 .",
    "note that the timescale condition implies that the rr torque dominates over the viscous torques , since @xmath100 .",
    "efficient torquing of the disk mass in a ring @xmath101 by stars in a spherical shell @xmath102 requires that the disk s angular momentum be smaller by at least some factor @xmath103 than the random residual angular momentum carried by the stars , assumed to be isotropically distributed ( this a conservative criterion , since it neglects the possibility of warping by transfer of angular momentum from the disk to the stars ) .",
    "the total angular momentum in both the disk and the stellar cusp is dominated by the large scales ( e.g. a disk with surface density @xmath104 (  [ ss : diskmodel ] ) and temperature that falls with @xmath76 has @xmath105 ( eq . [ e : hvrcs ] ) and @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the disk mass enclosed within @xmath76 ; a stellar cusp with @xmath108 (  [ ss : gnmodel ] ) has @xmath109 ) .",
    "we therefore approximate the angular momentum criterion by requiring that the angular momentum in the disk within @xmath76 be smaller than the residual angular momentum in the stars within @xmath14 ,    @xmath110    an equality in eq .",

    "in order to apply the rr torquing mechanism to the maser disk in ngc4258 , it is necessary to specify the stellar cusp density profile , the disk s viscous timescales , @xmath117 ( eq . [ e : tcond ] ) , and its enclosed mass @xmath118 ( eq . [ e : jcond ] ) .",

[ e : jcond ] with @xmath172 ) are satisfied for @xmath173 between @xmath174 and @xmath175 pc , so that rr torquing can warp the disk by at least @xmath176 , on average .",
    "we find that such an rr - induced warp is possible over a wide range of the observed and deduced physical parameters of the maser disk .",
    "rr warping is less efficient for disks with a very steep density profile , high density or a high mass accretion rate .",
    "we conclude that the rr mechanism can drive a moderate warp in the ngc4258 maser disk , but can not substantially perturb or disrupt it .",
    "we also find that the highest accretion rate consistent with masing is @xmath177 , which agrees with x - ray based estimates @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the torques exerted by the poisson fluctuations in the distribution of the stars around the mbh in ngc4258 can transfer momentum from the stars to the maser disk and excite the warp observed in the disk on a timescale @xmath178 , more efficiently than the bp effect ( @xmath179 , @xcite ) or radiation pressure ( @xcite ; see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "rr is inherent to the discreteness of the stellar system , and thus does not depend on particular initial conditions for the disk , such as the initial warp required for radiation pressure warping , or the initial misalignment between the disk and the mbh spin axis required by the bp effect .",
    "rr - induced warps are transient and vary on the rr timescale @xmath180 .",
    "the ngc4258 maser disk stands out in its well - defined morphology , keplerian dynamics and the available detailed high - quality observations .",
    "these make it ideal for testing the rr torquing model . however , vector rr operates also in non - keplerian spherical potentials , and can warp any disk configuration , as long as its mass is small enough and the viscous timescales are long enough .",
    "it therefore likely that rr torquing is relevant in other maser disk systems as well .",
    "generally , rr torquing of accretion disks is also expected on much smaller scales , driven by the strongly segregated cusp of stellar mass black holes @xcite .",
    "rr could thus potentially affect the accretion rate and direction , and thereby mbh mass and spin evolution ."
