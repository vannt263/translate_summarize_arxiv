    "this paper continues a series dedicated to the presentation of near - infrared photometry ( in @xmath0 and @xmath1 pass - bands ) for northern galactic open clusters .",
    "we already reported on the very young open clusters ngc  1893 and berkeley  86 ( vallenari et al 1999a ) , the old clusters berkeley  17 and berkeley  18 ( carraro et al 1999a ) , and the intermediate age clusters ic  166 and ngc  7789 ( vallenari et al 1999b ) . here",
    "we present @xmath0 and @xmath1 photometry for king  5 , a poorly studied open cluster for which no detailed study has been reported so far .",
    "+ king  5 is located near the galactic plane at @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and it is designated also as ocl  384 and c0311 + 525 by iau . its diameter is estimated to be about @xmath7 . +",
    "a preliminary investigation was conducted by phelps et al ( 1994 ) who obtained vi photometry for 1343 stars in a region of @xmath8 .",
    "this study revealed that king  5 is a cluster of the hyades generation , with an age around one billion years , derived from a morphological age estimator . + these authors do not report estimates for cluster distance and reddening .",
    "+ moderate resolution spectra for 24 stars in the field of king  5 have been obtained by scott et al ( 1995 ) . from this analysis",
    "it emerges that king  5 belongs to the old thin disk population , and its rotational velocity around the galactic center ( @xmath9 ) is consistent with hron ( 1987 ) rotation curve at the cluster location .",
    "+ on the base of the radial velocities 19 members have been singled out .",
    "+ more recently durgapal et al ( 1998 ) published ubvri photometry of king  5 , inferring by comparison with solar metallicity isochrones an age slightly lower than 1  gyr , a distance of 2  kpc and a reddening e(v - i)=0.94 .",
    "+ finally it is worth recalling that the metal abundance of king  5 has been determined by friel et al ( 1995 ) using medium resolution spectroscopy of twelve giant stars . from this study",
    "@xmath10 $ ] turns out to be ( @xmath11 ) , half than the solar value .",
    "+ in this paper we combine together ir and optical photometry to obtain an estimate of the cluster fundamental parameters .",
    "we find that the cluster is @xmath3 old . +",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : section  2 is devoted to the presentation of data acquisition and reduction ; in section  3 we discuss the morphology of the color magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) for different pass - bands ; section  4 is dedicated to the derivation of the color excess , while age and distance are inferred in section  5 .",
    "finally our conclusions are summarized in section  6 .",
    "0.8 cm    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the relations in usage per 1 sec exposure time are : @xmath12 @xmath13 with standard deviation of the zero points of 0.03 mag for the @xmath0 and 0.04 for the @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "this error is only due to the linear interpolation of the standard stars .",
    "the calibration uncertainty is dominated by the error due to the correction from aperture photometry to psf fitting magnitude .",
    "the standard stars used for the calibration do not cover the entire colour range of the data , because of the lack of stars redder than @xmath14 . from our data , no colour term is found for @xmath1 mag , whereas we can not exclude it for the @xmath0 magnitude . taking all into account",
    ", we estimate that the total error on the calibration is about 0.1 mag both in @xmath0 and @xmath1 pass - bands .",
    "the cmd derived from optical photometry is shown in the upper left panel of fig .  2 .",
    "the global morphology resembles the cmd of an intermediate age open cluster like ngc  2477 ( hartwick et al 1972 ) , tombaugh  1 ( carraro & patat 1995 ) and ngc  6603 ( bica et al 1993 ) .",
    "the ms extends vertically down to @xmath15 , and the turn off point ( to ) is situated at @xmath16 , @xmath17 .",
    "the brightest stars in the red region of the diagram can represent the red giant ( rg ) clump of core he - burning stars .",
    "most of these are cluster members , on the base of their radial velocities ( scott et al 1995 ) .",
    "the herzsprung gap is clearly defined .",
    "the population of stars on the right side of the ms are probably interlopers , showing that the cmd is contaminated by stars from the field of the galactic disk .",
    "also the stars above the to probably belong to the field .",
    "+ the cmd from ir photometry is shown in the lower panel of fig .  2 , and appears significantly different .",
    "in fact it is quite similar to the cmd of old open cluster like m  67 ( montgomery et al 1993 ) and berkeley  39 ( kassis et al 1997 ) .",
    "the ms extends down to @xmath18 , and the to is located at @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "the region above the to might contain some interlopers ( see fig .",
    "+ apparently there is no herzsprung gap , and the rgb is sparsely populated , like in all clusters with age greater that @xmath21 .",
    "the stars at @xmath22 , @xmath23 might represent the clump of core he burners , quite small in this age range .",
    "we recall that ir photometry covers all the cluster , and the foreground contamination is negligible , as it can be seen in fig .  3 , where two comparison fields @xmath24 eastwards and @xmath25 northwards , respectively , are shown . +    in order to clarify the nature and age range of this cluster , and whether the differences are simply due to the use of different colors , we have combined optical and ir data to construct the cmd in @xmath26 , which is shown in the lower right panel fig .",
    "this cmd looks like quite similar to the optical cmd shown in the same figure , demonstrating that king  5 is an intermediate age open cluster . to better assess this point , in the next sections we are going to determine in details the cluster basic parameters",
    "in order to derive the interstellar extinction for king  5 , we have combined optical and ir photometry ( @xmath27 stars in total ) , and construct two color diagrams , namely @xmath28 and @xmath29 , which are shown in fig .  4 and fig .  5 , respectively . only ms stars are considered .",
    "we superimposed a zero age ms ( zams ) for the theoretical metal content @xmath30 , obtained translating the observed @xmath10 $ ] by means of the relation :    @xmath31 = \\log \\frac{z}{0.019}\\ ] ]    taken from bertelli et al ( 1994 ) .",
    "since the cluster does not exhibit a rgb , it is not possible to derive an independent photometric estimate for the metal content .",
    "+ in fig .  4",
    "the fit has been obtained shifting the zams with e(j - k )  =  0.50 and e(v - k )  =  2.45 , which corresponds to a ratio @xmath32 , relatively close to the value @xmath33 suggested by cardelli et al ( 1989 ) .",
    "+ the fit in fig .",
    "5 , on the other hand , has been achieved shifting the zams by e(v - i )  =  1.10 and e(v - k )  =  2.45 , whose ratio turns out to be @xmath34 , in agreement with the value @xmath35 from cardelli et al ( 1989 ) .",
    "although reasonable , these estimates are affected by the limitation that the reddening vector is almost parallel to the zams . however , at least for e(v - i ) , our results do not differ to much from durgapal et al ( 1998 ) , although these author did not use the spectroscopic metallicity from friel et al ( 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , by using a lower metallicity , one should expect a larger reddening .",
    "the knowledge of metallicity and reddening , allows us to infer the distance and age of king  5 by means of fitting with isochrones ( bertelli et al 1994 ) .",
    "the fit is shown in the three panels of fig .",
    "6 , for the planes @xmath36 vs @xmath37 , @xmath36 vs @xmath38 , and @xmath1 vs @xmath39 , respectively .",
    "+ we have adopted the theoretical metallicity @xmath30 above derived , and performed the fitting with a @xmath3 isochrone , which better matches the observational data .",
    "the criterion that guided us in performing this comparison was the simultaneous fit of the to and the clump magnitudes .",
    "since no membership exists for this cluster , it is not possible to define exactly the ms to , which is populated also by unresolved binary stars , and interlopers ( see the field population in fig .  3 for an interpretation of the to region in the ir cmd ) .",
    "however the clump luminosity can be reliably determined , since many stars are also spectroscopic members . + by using the reddening estimated derived in the previous section , the apparent distance moduli @xmath40 and @xmath41 , in the plots turn out to be @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .",
    "the latter values can also be obtained assuming that the mean clump magnitude is @xmath44 ( girardi et al 1998 ) .",
    "once corrected , these values converge to the absolute distance modulus @xmath45 .",
    "+ king  5 turns out to be 1.9  kpc distant from the sun , and about 9.6  kpc far from the galactic center .",
    "in this paper we have presented a detailed study of the poorly known intermediate age open cluster king  5 . by combining optical and ir photometry",
    "we have proved that king  5 is a moderate age open cluster about @xmath46 old , intermediate in age between the hyades and ngc  752 .",
    "+ by studing the cmd and two color digrams , we have obtained estimates for the cluster reddening and distance . in detail , we found that the color excesses @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are 0.50 , 1.10 and 2.45 , respectively , and that their ratios are in agreement with the standard values ( cardelli et al 1989 ) .",
    "the derived corrected distance modulus @xmath50 implies a distance of 1.9  kpc from the sun .",
