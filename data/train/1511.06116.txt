    "the sun exhibits well established 11-year spot cycle , and a 22-year magnetic cycle .",

    "still , long - term monitoring of numerous stars has given us information on the properties of the activity cycles also in other stars .",
    "due to the time and page constraints this review concentrates on observed properties of stellar photospheric and chromospheric cycles .",

    "one of the best known methods to study activity cycles is to investigate the chromospheric emission in the cores of the ca ii h&k lines .",
    "this method is based on the fact that the active regions in the solar chromosphere give rise to emission in the cores of the ca ii h&k lines .",
    "typically , so - called s - index is calculated by comparing the flux in the ca ii h&k line cores to the flux at a close - by continuum region .",
    "photospheric activity cycles can also be studied from broad - band photometry . in many active stars",
    "the starspots are so large that they cause brightness variations which can be few tens of percent from the mean light level , thus making them easily observable even from the ground .",
    "even smaller spots are reachable from space - based photometry ( detectable cycle lengths are limited by relatively short instrument lifetimes ) .",
    "small ground - based automatic photospheric telescopes , that have been operational last two decades or longer , provide excellent data - sets for cycle studies .",
    "doppler imaging ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * vogt  1987 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* piskunov  1990 ) ) is a method that provides the best spatial resolution on the stellar surface .",
    "it uses high resolution , high signal - to - noise spectroscopic observations obtained at different rotational phases of the star . if the star has a non - uniform surface temperature , i.e. , has starspots , the spectral lines show small distortions from the normal gaussian shape .",
    "these distortions move in the line - profile when the position of the starspots on the surface changes , due to the change of line - of - sight velocity caused by the stellar rotation .",
    "the temperature maps , which are constructed by tracking the movement of these distortions , can be used for detailed studies of stellar spot configurations . if spectropolarimetric observations are obtained over the stellar rotation , similarly to what is done in doppler imaging , the surface magnetic field of the star can mapped using zeeman - doppler imaging technique ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the project was initiated in 1966 by olin wilson ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wilson 1968 ) ; ( * ? ? ? * wilson 1978 ) ) , and it originally monitored 91 stars with spectral types ranging from f to m. the monitoring was expanded to more stars and star types , and in total some 2000 stars were observed during the project s lifetime ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baliunas  1995 ) ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baliunas  1998 ) ) .",
    "the project found many stars with variations in the chromospheric emission , and distinguished four different activity types : variable , cyclic , trend , and flat activity . from the core sample of 111 dwarf stars",
    "60% of the targets show cyclic or apparently cyclic behaviour , 25% are variable and 15% exhibit flat activity ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "40% show cyclic and basically the same fraction variable activity ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* baliunas  1998 ) ) . meaning that the regularly cyclic activity seems to change to more chaotic behaviour when the star evolves .    for correlating the photospheric and chromospheric activity one can compare the chromospheric indicators from ca ii h&k and the photospheric spots from broadband photometry .",
    "* radick  ( 1998 ) ) compared these two different indicators .",
    "their results show that the younger , more active stars tend to become fainter as their hk emission increases , whereas the older stars tend to become brighter as their hk emission increases .",
    "this means that the activity of young stars is spot dominated , and that of the older stars is dominated by photospheric faculae .",
    "* brandenburg , saar , & turpin ( 1998 ) ) correlated the stellar activity with @xmath0 and noticed that the stars concentrate on ` active ' and ` inactive ' branches , later also ` super saturated ' branch was added ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "stars move along the active branch as they age . once reaching activity range -4.8",

    "it would be very important to obtain information on the spot latitudes during activity cycles in other stars . in the sun",

    "they used the known differential rotation law , obtained from previous doppler imaging work , in their reconstruction .",
    "spectropolarimetric observations of stars and mapping the detailed configurations of the surface field has been possible soon for two decades .",
    "still , the weak signal from the magnetic field demands superb observations , and the technique of zeeman doppler imaging requires many observations over a rotational phase for accurate surface reconstruction .",

    "no clear periodic reversals have been found in these studies , but we are collecting a dataset of long - term observation which will enable studying magnetic cycles in other stars than the sun .",

    "improved observing techniques we are starting to probe the detailed properties of stellar activity cycles .",
