    "initially , in order to set the stage for studying the localization of gauge fields in the present context , let us briefly review the thick brane scenario .",
    "the basic bloch brane background was previously studied in references @xcite .",
    "this model consists of two real scalar fields coupled to gravity and has as a starting point the following action @xmath2.\\ ] ] here , the brane is composed by the two real scalar fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which depend only on the extra dimension @xmath5 , @xmath6 denotes the scalar curvature and the space - time is an ads with @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , we adopt the following ansatz for the metric @xmath8 which preserves the @xmath9 lorentz invariance @xcite . the interaction of the two scalar fields modeling the brane will give rise to the warp factor function , which is indicated by @xmath10 .",
    "moreover , we denote the minkowski space - time metric by @xmath11 where the indexes @xmath12 and @xmath13 vary from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .    the equations of motion for the fields can be obtained from the action and might be cast in the form of the following coupled differential equations : @xmath16 in the last equation , @xmath17 stands for either @xmath3 or @xmath4 , while the prime denotes derivative with respect to the extra dimension @xmath5 .    at this point",
    ", it is useful to switch to the superpotential method , with which we can obtain first - order differential equations from the motion equations above .",
    "this is done by rewriting the potential in terms of a superpotential @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we obtain for the original potential the following expression @xmath19-\\frac13 w^2,\\ ] ] together with the equations @xmath20 and @xmath21 .    in order to obtain the bloch brane model ,",
    "one chooses the superpotential function to have the following form @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a real parameter that controls the brane thickness .",
    "finally , we find the following solutions that describe our brane model @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26.\\ ] ] from the second equation above , we can see that for the limit @xmath27 , the one - field scenario is recovered . for certain values of the coupling parameter @xmath23 , there is an splitting of the defect @xcite .",
    "this brane model supports internal structure which influences the matter energy density along the extra dimension .",
    "more details about this feature and graphical analysis of the solutions ( [ phi ] ) , ( [ chi ] ) , and ( [ warp ] ) are available in the reference @xcite .",
    "let us now analyze the zero mode of the vector gauge field on the two - field brane model .",
    "the basic bloch brane setup , as well as the other thick brane scenarios , is not capable of supporting the localization of the gauge field zero mode . indeed , as the warp factor is factorized out of the effective action , one obtains non normalizable solutions from the equations of motion to the gauge field .",
    "we fix this problem in the following sections . in order to illustrate these aspects , we start from the action for the gauge field coupled to the gravity as follows @xmath28 where the indexes @xmath29 and @xmath30 run from @xmath14 to @xmath31 .",
    "the field strength tensor reads @xmath32 .    by choosing the gauge @xmath33 , the equation of motion for @xmath34 is given by @xmath35 where we have used the ansatz @xmath36 we denote by @xmath37 the space - time coordinates of the observable universe .",
    "the function @xmath38 possesses all information about the gauge field in the extra dimension , so that we must verify the solutions of the equation ( [ zero ] ) in the effective action @xmath39     in equation ( [ u0 ] ) with @xmath40 ( points ) , @xmath41 ( line ) and @xmath42 ( dashed line ) . * ]    as one sees from the equation above , the warp factor is now absent of the effective action .",
    "therefore , its exponential suppression is lost and the existence of normalizable zero mode solutions depends on the solutions of the equation of motion to the gauge field in the extra dimension . with @xmath43 , we have the solution @xmath44 and the effective action goes to infinity , so that , with this solution , we can not guarantee the existence gauge field zero mode in this scenario .    equation ( 10 ) has also the solution @xmath45 however , due to the shape of the function @xmath10 , the solution @xmath46 diverges for any value of @xmath23 . in figure ( [ u0 ] ) we plot @xmath46 as a function of @xmath5 for different values of @xmath23 .",
    "we note that , @xmath46 diverges for small values of @xmath23 and , when we increase the value of @xmath23 , the solution diverges more rapidly , which renders the effective action infinite .",
    "therefore , the existence of a localized zero mode with this solution is not guaranteed .    to analyze the massive modes we can write the equation of motion ( 10 ) for @xmath47 as a schroedinger - like equation . @xmath48 with the potential given by @xmath49 this equation can not be written in the form corresponding to supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xmath50 .",
    "for this reason , we can not exclude the possibility of tachyonic states in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "the absence of resonant modes can be verified by the structure of the resulting potential , which we show in figure ( [ potzero ] ) .",
    "as we have noted the potential tends to infinity with negative values , and the maximum values are also negative . in addition , we note that the potential does not have the usual volcano - like structure which has been obtained in thick brane models with localized zero modes as well as gauge field resonant modes .     in equation ( [ v0 ] ) with @xmath51 ( points ) , @xmath52 ( line ) and @xmath40 ( dashed line ) . ]    as we have remarked , the standard bloch brane background is not capable to supporting the existence of a localized zero mode of the gauge field on the brane . following recent results ,",
    "we modify the two - field brane model presented in section [ gau_f_ze_mode ] in search for better prospects for localizing gauge fields in thick branes .",
    "in order to find a way around the difficulties for localizing gauge field on the brane model presented in section [ gau_f_ze_mode ] , we apply a method largely used to implement the localization of fields in thick brane setups @xcite . in this way , we study the features of the vector gauge field in a scenario we find convenient to call the dilatonic bloch brane .",
    "it is described by the action @xmath53 following the reference @xcite , we keep the scalar fields @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which describe the brane .",
    "then , we include the dilaton scalar field @xmath54 that will couple directly with the gauge field .",
    "this is the key point to achieve normalizable solutions .    in the following",
    "we adopt the ansatz for the metric @xcite @xmath55 then , the resulting equations of motion from the corresponding action read @xmath56 at a first glance , it is not clear which modifications are brought about by the dilaton field , but this will be clarified when we complete the background description . in order to obtain first - order differential equations we use the same superpotential method applied in section [ rev_bb_sce ] . with the aim of keeping the bloch brane structure",
    "we consider the following potential function @xcite @xmath57.\\ ] ] we obtain first - order differential equations that solve the equations of motion @xmath58 choosing the same superpotential function ( [ w ] ) , the solutions to @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath10 displayed in equations ( [ phi ] ) , ( [ chi ] ) , and ( [ warp ] ) remain valid in the present case .    in view of this new background , let us turn our attention to the effective action for the gauge field .",
    "we introduce the coupling with the dilaton as follows @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 represents a parameter which controls the dilaton coupling .    again , using the gauge @xmath33 together with the ansatz @xmath61 and @xmath62 , we obtain the equation for part of the gauge field which depends on the extra dimension , namely @xmath63\\frac{du(y)}{dy}=m^{2}e^{2(b - a)}u(y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from the equation above , for @xmath43 and using the relations ( [ singularidade1 ] ) we have the solution @xmath44 , that is enough to guarantee the existence of gauge field zero mode localized on the brane . in this way we take the effective action and decompose it in the following way @xmath64 where we have used again the proportionality relation between the functions @xmath54 and @xmath10 , as in eqs .",
    "we remark that , in order to recover the background without the dilaton coupling we must , in addition to suppressing the coupling @xmath60 , return to the metric ansatz ( 2 ) , proceeding in an analogous manner as in references @xcite .",
    "direct comparison of the action above with the action ( [ acao ] ) , which does not include the dilaton , shows that the inclusion of the dilaton on the brane model brought back the warp factor for effective action .",
    "we can see clearly that for @xmath65 the solution is normalizable .",
    "the dilaton coupling has the effect of limiting the range of the gauge field in the extra dimension , a desired feature when one wishes to achieve localization .",
    "thus , we conclude that the dilatonic bloch brane does support the existence of gauge field zero modes .",
    "in this section , we address the question of how the massive modes interact with the dilatonic brane scenario . in order to analyze the kaluza - klein massive spectrum , we return to the equation ( [ zero2dil ] ) with @xmath47 and transform it into a schroedinger - like equation .",
    "this can be carried out by using the prescription @xmath66 where @xmath67 . in this way",
    "we arrive at the following schroedinger - like equation @xmath68 with the one - particle potential @xmath69 . here",
    ", the functions @xmath70 and @xmath71 represent , respectively the first derivative and the second derivative with respect to @xmath72 .",
    "equation ( [ schgauge ] ) can also be written as the form corresponding to supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xmath73 this excludes the possibility of tachyonic states in the spectrum @xcite .    in order to investigate the existence of gaps in the spectrum",
    ", we must study the asymptotic behavior of the potential @xmath74 .",
    "however , due to the transformations ( [ t ] ) we can not find the function @xmath75 analytically , which means that the potential must be studied numerically . the potential obtained in this way is shown in figure ( [ pot1 ] ) . in the left - hand side of figure ( [ pot1 ] ) , we observe the influence of parameter @xmath23 on the potential .",
    "as we can see , when @xmath23 tends to zero the minimum at @xmath76 splits into two minima , revealing the existence of internal structure as noticed in reference @xcite . in the present article , we are more interested in the influence of the dilaton coupling on massive modes .",
    "for this reason , on the right side of figure ( [ pot1 ] ) , we focus on the @xmath60-dependence of the potential .",
    "notice that increasing the intensity of the dilaton coupling ( raising the value of @xmath60 ) , the values of the two maxima of the potential increase while the two minima are merge into a single one .",
    "this feature is very interesting , considering that it changes the behavior of the massive modes in the region between the maxima , i.e. , in the region where the four - dimensional universe is located .",
    "therefore , the dilaton coupling will contribute to the interaction of the massive modes with the brane .     for @xmath77 $ ] ( solid line ) ,",
    "@xmath78 $ ] ( points ) .",
    "right : plots of @xmath79 for @xmath80 $ ] ( solid line ) and @xmath74 for @xmath81 $ ] ( doted line ) .",
    "notice that , in order to optically accommodate both graphs in a single frame , the potential in the graph for @xmath80 $ ] appears multiplied by a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "]    let us now turn to the the effects on the the solutions of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes that arise due to the increasing of the maximum values of the potential relative to the square mass .",
    "we present in figure ( [ pot2 ] ) the plots of the potential @xmath74 and of the function @xmath82 for the mass values @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "( solid line ) and @xmath82 ( points ) for @xmath52 , @xmath85 , @xmath83 ( left ) , @xmath84 ( right ) . ]    as we can see , light modes are suppressed in the region between the two maxima , however for @xmath86 the wave function oscillates in the region near the brane . observing the asymptotical behavior of the potential we conclude that @xmath87 and the continuum spectra is free of gaps .    in the case of very large masses , satisfying the condition @xmath88 , the potential represents only a slight perturbation .",
    "therefore , resonant modes would rather be expected in the region @xmath89 @xcite .",
    "indeed , as noticed in references @xcite , for some specific masses , the plane wave solutions of the schroedinger equations can resonate with the potential , thus exhibiting exceedingly large amplitude inside the brane . in the present case",
    ", such structures will show us how the gauge field massive modes couple to matter on the brane .    in order to search for the existence of resonant modes",
    "we will consider the probability density of the wave function at the center of the brane , an idea which has been applied successfully before @xcite . to this end",
    ", we evaluate the probability density of the normalized wave function at @xmath76 for a given value of @xmath90 , which is defined according to @xmath91    in the top of figure ( [ reso ] ) we show @xmath92 for some values of the coupling constant @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath93 we find resonant modes respectively for masses @xmath94 . to confirm that our technique is suitable for detecting resonant modes , in the figure ( [ reso ] )",
    ", we showed the solutions of the wave functions for the values of masses indicated with peaks in @xmath92 .",
    "we note that these specific energies correspond to wave functions with very high amplitudes inside the brane .",
    "it is remarkable that we find heavy resonant modes .",
    "this is in contrast to what we have observed previously in the case of kalb - ramond fields @xcite and of a gauge field @xcite ,",
    "both in deformed branes , and also of fermions in thick branes @xcite and also of graviton resonances @xcite , where the resonant modes are only found for very low values of the mass .",
    "we attribute this effect to the increasing of the coupling between the gauge field and the dilaton .",
    "a similar feature has been reported in @xcite .",
    "( up ) and @xmath95 ( down ) for @xmath96 ( left ) , @xmath97 ( center ) and @xmath98 ( right ) .",
    "we have used @xmath52 . ]",
    "another important point to be considered is about the influence of the brane internal structure on the resonant modes .",
    "as we know , the thickness of the defect increases with decreasing @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this effect results in an increased spacing between the two maxima of the gauge field potential , as noted in figure ( [ pot1 ] ) . to analyze how this change in the internal structure interferes in the coupling of massive modes with the brane",
    ", we show in figure ( [ reso2 ] ) the function @xmath92 keeping @xmath60 fixed and reducing the value of @xmath23 .",
    "we conclude that reducing the thickness of the defect causes an effect similar to increasing the dilaton coupling , i.e. , the resonances occur for heavy masses .     for @xmath99 , @xmath100 ( solid line ) , @xmath51 ( points ) and @xmath52 ( dashed line ) . ]    observing figures ( [ reso ] ) and ( [ reso2 ] ) we verify that the masses of the resonant modes depend on the values of @xmath23 and @xmath60 . increasing the value of these constants leads to resonant modes with larger masses .",
    "however for certain combinations of these two constants we obtain very broad peaks for the @xmath92 .",
    "this characterizes states with life - time too short to result in any physical effect .",
    "the life - time @xmath101 of observed resonances can be estimated by @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the width in mass at half maximum of the peaks in @xmath92 @xcite . in figure",
    "( [ lifetime ] ) we plot two examples of broad peaks in @xmath92 with @xmath104 that can not be considered as resonant states . as a rule , for small values of @xmath60 or for values of @xmath23 approaching to @xmath105 , we obtain structures with too short life - times ( @xmath104 ) . on the other hand , for larger values of @xmath60 and for lower values of @xmath23",
    ", we obtain longer life - times .",
    "furthemore , when we find peaks on the @xmath92 function that may be considered as resonances , they appear only once in the mass spectrum for each potential considered in the equation of motion .",
    "this interesting aspect of finding more than one resonance for the same potential , for instance , has been found in another article , where we have considered the study of fermions in deformed branes @xcite .     with @xmath106 $ ] on left and @xmath107 $ ] right .",
    "we note the presence of broader peaks . * ]",
    "we have analyzed several aspects of the localization properties of the vector gauge field in a brane generated by two scalar fields coupled to gravity : the bloch brane .",
    "initially , by considering the basic defect setup we have concluded that there is no normalizable solution for the zero mode of the gauge field . as the warp factor does not appear in the effective action , there is no convergence factor and the solutions of the equations of motion render the part of the effective action regarding the extra dimension infinite . to circumvent this problem ,",
    "we have applied a method widely used in the study of vector and tensor gauge fields in thick membrane models . by introducing the dilaton field to the background , and thereby bringing the exponential suppression from the warp factor back to the effective action",
    ", we were able to guarantee the existence of a localized zero mode .",
    "this new scenario allowed us to analyze the massive spectrum in a supersymmetric quantum mechanics framework . in this way",
    ", we have transformed the equations of motion into a schroedinger - like equation where we have analyzed the influence of the potential on the wave solutions .",
    "the potential extracted from the schroedinger equation exhibits a splitting caused by the internal structure of the membrane .",
    "when we increase the intensity of the dilaton coupling , the values of the two maxima of the potential are increased while the two minima merge into one another .",
    "thus , when we increase @xmath60 the coupling with the membrane is suppressed for all but the heavy modes .",
    "this feature stems from the fact that , for masses obeying @xmath108 , the potential represents only a small perturbation .",
    "we have found new resonance structures in the massive spectrum .",
    "these new resonant modes are different and posses the interesting property that , contrary to what is found in previous similar investigations , they appear also for large masses depending on the intensity of the dilaton coupling . by considering the probability density of finding the modes at @xmath76 , we have found a variety of such resonant modes , which carry information about the coupling of massive modes with matter on the membrane in terms of the coupling with the dilaton field and the internal dynamics of the membrane . regarding the internal structure of the membrane",
    ", we have shown that reducing the thickness of the defect increases the value of the masses in which the resonances occur .",
    "similarly , when we increase the value of the constant - coupling @xmath60 , we also obtain resonant modes for larger masses .",
    "this shows that the coupling of the dilaton is able to favor the coupling with the membrane with heavy modes .",

    "<S> we present new results on the localization of gauge fields in thick brane models . </S>",
    "<S> the four - dimensional observable universe is considered to be a topological defect which is generated by two scalar fields coupled with gravity embedded in a five - dimensional space - time . </S>",
    "<S> like other thick brane models , the bloch brane setup is not capable of supporting gauge field localization . in order to circumvent this problem </S>",
    "<S> we include the dilaton field and , as a result , obtain normalizable solutions . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , by writing the equations of motion as schroedinger - like equations , we have found new kinds of resonances in the massive spectrum which appear also for heavy modes . </S>",
    "<S> this is in sharp contrast to what is commonly found in previous analog studies , where only light modes become resonant . at specific energies , the wave solutions exhibit very high amplitudes within the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of the dilaton coupling and of the internal structure on the resonant modes are also discussed . </S>"
