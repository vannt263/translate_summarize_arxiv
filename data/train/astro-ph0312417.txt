    "this is an expanded version of comments made during the recent meeting on  agn physics with the sdss \" ( princeton , july 2003 ) , concerning the agn radio loudness bimodality and the relation of radio loudness and black hole mass .",
    "these comments are not based on my earlier or ongoing work , and rely only on the existing literature .",
    "they are presented here with the hope of stimulating further work on these subjects .",
    "the existence of a bimodality in the radio to optical flux ratio ( @xmath0 ) distribution in agn was long thought to be a well established  textbook \" result ( e.g. peterson 1997 ; krolik 1999 ; kembhavi & narlikar 1999 ) .",
    "however , the recent first survey , a large area , deep , high resolution radio survey revealed no @xmath0 bimodality ( white et al .",
    "2000 ) , but rather a smooth distribution with a peak , instead of a dip , at intermediate @xmath0 values .",
    "this surprising result prompted various attempts to explain the sharp disagreement with earlier studies of radio and optical emission in agn ( ivezi ' c  et al .",
    "2002 ; cirasuolo et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the first survey differs from most earlier surveys in its significantly higher sensitivity and angular resolution ( becker , white , & helfand 1995 ) .",
    "blundell ( 2003 ) has recently shown a dramatic ( but possibly anecdotal ) example of the insensitivity of the first survey images to extended radio emission , when compared to the lower resolution images of the nvss survey .",
    "below i point out existing evidence that the lack of sensitivity to extended emission may be related to the lack of @xmath0 bimodality in the first survey .",
    "xu , livio & baum ( 1999 ) compiled 5  ghz and [ o  iii ] luminosities for a large and heterogeneous sample of 409 agn , covering 7 orders of magnitude in @xmath1}$ ] , and 9 orders of magnitude in @xmath2 . in low luminosity",
    "agn the optical continuum can be obscured , or heavily contaminated by the host starlight , and thus @xmath1}$ ] serves as a useful proxy for the agn optical continuum luminosity .",
    "figure 1 in xu et al . reveals a clearly bimodal distribution of agn in the @xmath2 vs. @xmath1}$ ] plane .",
    "radio loud ( rl ) agn are on average about @xmath3 times more radio luminous than radio quiet ( rq ) agn at a given @xmath1}$ ] .",
    "however , a different distribution is seen in their figure 3 where they show a plot of the _ core _ 5  ghz luminosity vs. @xmath1}$ ] for the same sample .",
    "this plot shows _ no bimodality _ , but rather a smooth distribution of @xmath2 values at a given @xmath1}$ ] .",
    "thus , the bimodality of the @xmath0 values distribution in agn may be true only for the _ total _ , rather than just _",
    "core _ radio emission .",
    "the lack of bimodality in the first survey may then simply reflect its lack of sensitivity to extended radio flux , and it may not necessarily contradict the notion of @xmath0 bimodality in agn .",
    "the core radio emission is susceptible to beaming effects , and may not provide a reliable estimate of the true jet power , unlike the extended radio emission , which is most likely isotropic and should provide a better estimate of the jet power .",
    "thus , the bimodality revealed when the extended radio emission is included is likely to reflect a true bimodality in the fraction of agn power emitted in the radio .",
    "various studies of agn suggested there is a relation between the black hole mass @xmath4 and radio power ( e.g. franceschini , vercellone , & fabian 1998 ) , or @xmath4 and radio loudness ( e.g. laor 2000 ) , such that agn with @xmath5 are all rl , and agn with @xmath6 are all rq .",
    "however , other studies ( ho 2002 ; oshlack , webster , & whiting 2002 ; woo & urry 2002 ) found contradicting results .",
    "in particular , they found a significant number of low @xmath4 radio loud agn .",
    "as shown below , a closer inspection of the available data reveals that the published low @xmath4 rl agn can be classified under three categories : 1 .",
    "wrong @xmath4 determinations .",
    "2 . objects where beaming is likely ( and may therfore be intrinsically radio quiet ) .",
    "3 . very low luminosity agn .",
    "in addition , there is evidence in the literature that the @xmath0 parameter which separates rl and rq agn does not have a fixed value , but rather increases with decreasing luminosity .",
    "this implies that the apparently rl , low @xmath4 , low luminosity agn may belong to the rq population .",
    "overall , the results presented below indicate that there is no robust case of a luminous rl agn at @xmath6 , and there may be no low @xmath4  true \" rl agn at lower luminosities as well .",
    "woo & urry ( 2002 ) compiled data from various earlier studies and find a number of rlq at @xmath6 . in their table 3 they compiled @xmath4 estimates based on the size of the broad line region ( @xmath7 ) and the h@xmath8 fwhm , where the @xmath7 determination is based on reverberation mappings .",
    "they find two rl agn with @xmath6 , 3c120 , and pg  1226 + 230 ( 3c273 ) . in 3c120",
    "the @xmath9 determination appears quite robust ( rather well determined @xmath7 from reverberation mapping + high quality h@xmath8 optical spectra ) .",
    "however , this object has a compact and flat spectrum radio source , it shows superluminal motion , rapid variability and a high polarization , all of which indicate the radio emission is strongly beamed . in 3c273 the @xmath10 value cited from kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) is erroneous . the actual value in kaspi et al .",
    "is @xmath11 .    in table 4 of woo & urry they list @xmath4 determinations where @xmath7 is estimated based on the continuum luminosity .",
    "practically all of the rlq at @xmath6 in this table come from two studies , gu , cao , & jiang ( 2001 ) , and oshlack , webster , & whiting ( 2002 ) which is discussed in the following section .",
    "find 7 rlq at @xmath6 , based on spectra published and measured by stickel & kuhr ( 1993a , b ) , stickel , kuhr , & fried ( 1993 ) , and lawrence et al .",
    "the spectra from these studies are enclosed in the appendix . in all cases",
    "the h@xmath8 line is very narrow , and its fwhm is similar to the fwhm of the forbidden lines .",
    "in addition , the [ o iii]@xmath12/h@xmath8 flux ratio is @xmath13 ( see tables in the above stickel et al . and lawrence et al .",
    "these two properties of the measured h@xmath8 component indicate that it originates purely from the nlr , and not from the blr , as assumed by gu et al .",
    "since the nlr velocity dispersion is typically @xmath13 smaller than in the blr , the bh mass estimate in these objects is a factor of @xmath14 too low .",
    "some of these 7 objects are not pure type 2 agn , as they show some evidence for a blr component underlying the nlr component . in 1045@xmath15188",
    "a broad base of h@xmath8 appears to be partly hidden by atmospheric absorption , in 1945 + 726 a very broad component is clearly seen in h@xmath16 , and in 2218 + 395 a weak broad base is seen in h@xmath8 .",
    "however , only the nlr h@xmath8 component was measured in these objects in the papers mentioned above .      the oshlack et al",
    "sample is drawn from the parkes half - jansky flat - spectrum sample ( phfs ) .",
    "as oshlack et al .",
    "comment , the flat radio spectrum criterion should favor selection of beamed core dominated objects , and evidence that this indeed happens is provided by the significant contribution of a steep power law component , apparently synchrotron emission , to the optical ir emission in a large fraction of their objects .",
    "apart from the beaming correction which may significantly reduce the implied intrinsic radio power ( jarvis & mclure 2002 ) , there may also be some inaccurate deductions from the optical spectra , as detailed below .",
    "oshlack et al .",
    "deduce @xmath4 based on the h@xmath8 fwhm and continuum luminosity .",
    "they find 16 rl agn with @xmath6 ( table 1 there ) .",
    "the optical spectra of four of these objects appear in wilkes et al .",
    "( 1983 ) . in pks  1509 + 022",
    "the spectrum is very red , the s / n is low , and h@xmath8 appears to be significantly broader than estimated ( fwhm@xmath17  km  s@xmath18 , rather than 6550  km  s@xmath18 ) , implying @xmath19 ( rather than @xmath20 ) . in pks  1555@xmath15140",
    "the spectrum is also very red , there is no detectable h@xmath8 , and h@xmath16 width is used instead .",
    "the [ s  ii]@xmath21 doublet just redward of h@xmath16 is remarkably strong and of comparable strength and width to h@xmath16 , which suggests h@xmath16 is mostly from the nlr . in pks  1725 + 044",
    "the s / n is rather low , and h@xmath8 appears to be significantly broader than estimated ( fwhm@xmath22  km  s@xmath18 , rather than 2400  km  s@xmath18 , implying @xmath23 , rather than @xmath24 ) . in",
    "pks  2143@xmath15156/r the fwhm estimate of 836  km  s@xmath18 is based on a low s / n mg  ii profile .",
    "this object was later observed by jackson & browne ( 1991a ) , who measured a fwhm of 4700  km  s@xmath18 directly for h@xmath8 ( jackson & browne 1991b ) , implying @xmath25 , rather than @xmath26 .",
    "thus in all four objects the @xmath6 determinations do not appear robust .",
    "of the remaining 12 @xmath6 objects in oshlack et al .",
    ", four have @xmath27 .",
    "these four objects also have the lowest luminosities , @xmath28  erg  s@xmath18 , i.e. @xmath29 .",
    "these very low luminosity agn are further discussed below . of the remaining 8 ,",
    "only the spectrum of pks  2004@xmath15447 is published in oshlack , webster , & whiting ( 2001 ) .",
    "this object clearly has very narrow balmer lines from the blr , although its sed is quite red .",
    "no published optical spectra are available for the remaining 8 objects , and the accuracy of the @xmath4 estimate could not be assessed .",
    "ho ( 2002 ) studied the radio loudness vs. @xmath4 relation in a heterogeneous sample of galaxies ranging over 12 orders of magnitudes in @xmath30 .",
    "there are 16 rl agn in this sample with @xmath6 .",
    "three of these are relatively luminous having @xmath31 .",
    "the first ( in table 2 there ) is 3c  120 , already discussed above ; the second is pg  1211 + 143 , which is actually a rqq ( see corrected radio flux in kellermann et al .",
    "1994 ) ; and the third is pg 1704 + 608 , where the value of @xmath32 is taken from kaspi et al . , who used h@xmath8 fwhm=890 km  s@xmath18 which contrasts with the fwhm=6560 km  s@xmath18 obtained by boroson & green ( 1992 ) .",
    "this large discrepancy results from an inaccurate subtraction of the strong nlr h@xmath8 component , and the boroson & green value appears to be the correct one ( t. boroson and s. kaspi , private communications ) .",
    "thus , the only luminous ( @xmath31  mag ) rl agn in the ho sample at @xmath6 is 3c  120 , which is most likely beamed .",
    "the remaining 13 rl agn with @xmath6 in the ho sample all have @xmath33  mag .",
    "there are indications that low luminosity agn have a different distribution of @xmath0 parameters , compared to luminous agn .",
    "in particular , ho & peng ( 2001 ) find that most of the very low luminosity agn ( @xmath34  mag , their fig.4 ) are rl , and their @xmath0 value distribution extends to higher values ( @xmath35 ) than observed in high luminosity optically selected agn ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "are all low luminosity agn rl ? does the radio loudness bimodality disappears at low luminosities ?",
    "the following section suggests it does not disappear .",
    "the xu et al .",
    "study shows another remarkable and apparently overlooked result .",
    "their fig.1 shows that the bimodal distribution of agn in the @xmath2 vs. @xmath1}$ ] plane extends from the luminous agn level down by 4 - 5 orders of magnitude in @xmath1}$ ] .",
    "however , the dividing line which separates the two populations follows @xmath37}^{\\sim 0.5}$ ] , indicating that @xmath38})$ ] along this line does not have a fixed value , but rather increases towards low luminosity .",
    "thus , the @xmath39 value commonly used to separate rl from rq agn at high luminosities ( @xmath40 , e.g. kellermann et al .",
    "1989 ) , is not the correct value to use at low luminosity .",
    "the data of xu et al . suggests that one should use @xmath41 to separate ",
    "true \" rl from  true \" rq agn as a function of @xmath42 .",
    "e.g. , at @xmath43 one should use @xmath44 to separate the group of @xmath45 rq agn from the group of @xmath46 rl agn .",
    "one major pitfall in existing @xmath4 estimates based on the h@xmath8 fwhm is proper subtraction of the nlr contribution to h@xmath8 .",
    "this problem tends to be significant in rlq compared to rqq , since rlq generally have a stronger nlr component than rqq at the same luminosity ( e.g. boroson & green 1992 ) . in some cases ( mentioned above ) the blr h@xmath8 component is either very weak or nonexistent , and",
    "only the nlr h@xmath8 component was measured ( but attributed to the blr ) . to properly subtract the nlr h@xmath8 component",
    "one should typically assume @xmath47\\lambda 5007}$ ] , the average ratio seen in nlr dominated agn ( e.g. osterbrock 1989 ) .",
    "another common source of error is very low s / n spectra , which can result in highly inaccurate h@xmath8 fwhm values and @xmath4 estimates .",
    "another thing to watch for is objects with a very red continuum and an h@xmath16/h@xmath8 flux ratio @xmath48 . in such objects",
    "the h@xmath16 line sometimes shows a dramatically different profile from h@xmath8 . in particular , h@xmath16 may show a strong broad component , which is either very weak or undetectable in h@xmath8 ( e.g. 1945 + 726 , stickel & kuhr 1993a ) .      the apparently robust cases of rl agn with @xmath6 are found in two populations of objects .",
    "first , compact flat spectrum sources , such as pks  2004 - 447 ( oshlack et al . 2001 , 2002 ) and 3c  120 .",
    "as discussed by jarvis & mclure ( 2002 ) , their radio flux is most likely enhanced by beaming , and their observed h@xmath8 line width may be biased to low values if the blr is in a face on disk .",
    "however , it is difficult to make an accurate quantitative correction to both effects , especially if large corrections are expected .",
    "independent estimates of @xmath4 in compact flat spectrum sources can be obtained from measurements of the host galaxy luminosity and the @xmath4 - bulge luminosity relation .",
    "preliminary results based on this method suggest luminous host galaxies and thus large @xmath4 in the oshlack et al .",
    "objects ( jarvis & mclure 2003 ) .",
    "apparently , the only robust case of low @xmath4 rl agn consists of low luminosity agn ( ho 2002 ) .",
    "however , here we may be missled by using @xmath39 to separate rl from rq agn , which applies for luminous agn . the large compilation of xu et al .",
    "suggests that @xmath49 may be a more relevant number when going down from @xmath50  erg  s@xmath18 agn to @xmath51  erg  s@xmath18 agn . with this revised , luminosity dependent radio loudness @xmath0 threshold ,",
    "practically all of the @xmath6 agn in the sample of ho belong to the  true \" rq agn population .",
    "the various literature results pointed out in this comment suggest that _ the radio loudness vs. @xmath4 relation extends to low luminosity agn _ .",
    "specifically , that all true rl agn have @xmath19 , and all agn with @xmath6 are true rq agn . an additional interesting hint supporting this suggestion can be seen in figure 5 of xu et al .",
    ", which shows the distribution of host galaxies of the agn in the @xmath2 vs. @xmath1}$ ] plane .",
    "spiral hosts populate only the lower  true \" rq agn branch , and only elliptical and s0 hosts appear in the upper rl agn branch .",
    "finally , the lack of radio loudness bimodality in the first survey appears to be consistent with a similar lack of bimodality in known samples when one uses the core , rather than total , radio emission .",
    "since the extended radio emission probably provides a better estimate of the intrinsic radio power , the radio emission in agn is likely to be intrinsically bimodal .",
