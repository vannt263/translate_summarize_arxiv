    "since the pioneering works of anderson,@xcite and mott and twose,@xcite electronic and transport properties of randomly disordered systems have been the subject of long - lasting interest both from fundamental and applied viewpoints .",
    "one - dimensional ( @xmath0d ) systems are frequently considered because they turn out to be simpler than those in three dimensions.@xcite originally , mott and twose  @xcite conjectured that all states are localized in @xmath0d systems , for any degree of disorder .",
    "afterwards , a great deal of work has been devoted to examine mott - twose conjecture ( see , for instance , the review  ) .",
    "however , it is well - known that electron delocalization appears in 1d random systems with short - range correlations.@xcite    two decades ago , theodorou and cohen established that the density of states ( dos ) of a @xmath0d tight - binding hamiltonian with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions and random off - diagonal elements presents a singularity at the center of the band.@xcite these authors used an analytical approach based on previous results obtained by dyson  @xcite for disordered linear chains of harmonic oscillators . in ref",
    ", it was also stated that the corresponding state is delocalized as the localization length was found to be infinite . adding some amount of diagonal disorder in the presence of off - diagonal randomness makes all states to be localized .",
    "@xcite remarkably , the first calculations on @xmath0d tight - binding hamiltonians with only diagonal disorder did not reveal any singularity neither in the dos nor in the localization length.@xcite further , it was found both numerically @xcite and analytically @xcite a very weak anomaly ( a peak but not a singularity ) in both properties mentioned above .",

    "et al_. have found by numerical diagonalization of the @xmath0d frenkel hamiltonian with off - diagonal disorder that , notwithstanding the singularity of the dos , the corresponding state is localized if one includes the long - range ( lr ) interactions due to dipolar coupling between different sites.@xcite this finding seems to be in contradiction with the point of view raised in ref .",
    "suggesting that the state corresponding to the singularity of the dos is delocalized . in this paper",
    ", we examine in detail the conclusions of refs .   and  .",
    "we address this issue by considering a @xmath0d frenkel hamiltonian with off - diagonal disorder with nn interactions and compare the results with those obtained when lr interactions are taken into account .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ ? ] , the @xmath0d frenkel hamiltonian with nn interactions is analyzed .",

    "[ frham ] . section  [ simul ] deals with the numerical simulations confirming the analytical results .",
    "using numerical diagonalization of a frenkel hamiltonian with lr interactions , we calculate both the dos and the inverse participation ratio , to be defined below , and study new features of these magnitudes with respect to the nn approach .",
    "section  [ sum ] concludes with some comments regarding the results we have obtained .",
    "in this section we briefly review the arguments of ref .   leading to the conclusion that the state at the center of the band is delocalized .",
    "we present further arguments suggesting the opposite point of view and , what is most important , numerical calculations confirm our statement .",
    "let us consider a tight - binding hamiltonian with only nn interactions @xmath1 where the nn interactions @xmath2 are assumed to be @xmath3-correlated and similarly distributed stochastic variables .",
    "the state vector @xmath4 represents an excitation at _ site _ @xmath5 .",
    "all site energies are set to zero since no diagonal disorder is included .",
    "the eigenvalue problem of the nn model reads @xmath6 where the set @xmath7 represents the real eigenvector corresponding to the eigenenergy @xmath8 . for zero energy eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) gives the recurrence relation @xmath9 .",
    "using this relation one can find @xmath10 the amplitudes at even positions vanish .",
    "the eigenvector ( [ a ] ) represents the zero - energy state for a chain with odd number of sites . defining the localization length at the center of the band @xmath11 by the expression @xmath12 and applying the central - limit theorem , the authors of ref .",
    "obtained @xmath13 . from this result",
    "they concluded that the state at center of the band was extended .",
    "the definition of the localization length ( [ l ] ) is based on an unconditional assumption of the so - called exponential localization . indeed ,",
    "in such a case one would have typically @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "certainly , the definition ( [ l ] ) can not discern between a weaker than exponentially localized state ( where the amplitude @xmath15 decreases or increases with @xmath5 slower than an exponential ) and an extended state ( where @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the number of sites in the chain ) .",
    "in such a case , the mean extension of the eigenfunctions or the inverse participation ratio are the more adequate quantities for learning the character of the state .    the results presented below show that the problem we are discussing just belongs to those which can not be adequately analyzed from the assumptions leading to eq .",
    "( [ l ] ) .",
    "first , let us write the nn interactions in the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a gaussian distributed stochastic variables with variance @xmath20 .",
    "then , it is easy to calculate the probability distribution of @xmath21 , @xmath22 from this , the authors of ref .   claimed that typically @xmath23 .",
    "if so , one should conclude that the zero - energy state is localized rather than extended , in contradiction with the statement of ref .  .",
    "further , using eq .",
    "( [ g_xi ] ) we can calculate the probability distribution of @xmath24 , @xmath25 this function has a sharp peak at @xmath26 and a very broad tail for large @xmath27 such that @xmath28 .",
    "thus , it is rather difficult to make a definite conclusion from eq .",
    "( [ f_chi ] ) concerning a typical dependence of @xmath29 on @xmath5 . nevertheless , the fact that @xmath30 certainly indicates the zero probability to obtain an extended state .",
    "below , we confirm this observation by numerical simulations .",
    "we will be also interested in studying both the dos and the degree of localization of states of a 1d tight - binding hamiltonian including all ( lr ) interactions , beyond the nn interactions . according to this ,",
    "we then introduce the complete hamiltonian @xmath31 in which summation is performed now over all pair of sites . for definiteness",
    ", it is assumed hereafter that excitations described by the presented hamiltonian correspond to frenkel excitons .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath32 is assumed to be of dipole - dipole nature .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case in which all transition dipole moments have the same magnitude and direction .",
    "thus , one can take @xmath33 , where @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) is the dipole - dipole coupling of nearest - neighbors in the periodic lattice , i.e. at @xmath36 ( we chose here the negative sign of nn coupling as it takes place , for example , in j - aggregates  @xcite ) , and @xmath37 with @xmath38 being a stochastic variables assuming to be distributed around the regular sequence according to the gaussian law with variance @xmath39 @xmath40      before any discussions of the effects resulted from localization , it is useful to recall the peculiar features of the 1d - exciton spectrum and of the dos in the absence of disorder @xmath41",
    ". then the hamiltonian ( [ hn ] ) can be approximately diagonalized ( with accuracy of the order of @xmath42 ) by introducing the excitonic basis  @xcite @xmath43 the state vector @xmath44 represents an exciton in the @xmath45-th state . substituting ( [ k ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ hn ] ) one obtains  @xcite    [ one ] @xmath46 @xmath47    equation  ( [ ek ] ) generalizes the corresponding expression of the nn approximation [ @xmath48 term in ( [ ek ] ) ] to the case of including all ( lr ) interactions .",
    "we are especially interested in the behavior of the spectrum and of the dos in the vicinity of extreme points , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as well as at the center of the band , @xmath51 ( @xmath52 taken to be odd ) .",
    "to do that , we exploit the following equation  @xcite @xmath53 and the fact that one can extend the sum in eq.([ek ] ) up to infinity because @xmath54 decreases with @xmath5 fast enough . then , by integrating eq .",
    "( [ grad ] ) twice with respect to @xmath55 , the sum in eq .",
    "( [ ek ] ) can be cast into the form  @xcite    [ two ] @xmath56 @xmath57    where @xmath58 .",
    "the corresponding formulae within the nn approximation are @xmath59 if @xmath60 and @xmath61 if @xmath62 .",
    "thus , one can conclude that lr interactions affect both the position of the bottom and the top of the band as well as the dos of @xmath0d excitons . as we can see , the bottom and top of the band change , respectively , from @xmath63 to @xmath64 and from @xmath65 to @xmath66 .",
    "the dos decreases approximately by the factor @xmath67 in the vicinity of the bottom of the band and , on the contrary , grows by the factor @xmath68 close the top .",
    "finally , we would like to comment on the energy of the central exciton band state , with @xmath69 . in the nn model",
    ", one finds that @xmath70 , while with including all dipolar couplings , this energy is shifted to @xmath71 the dos in the vicinity of the band center does not change noticeably as compared to the nn model .      in the presence of disorder",
    ", the hamiltonian of the system can be written as a sum of two parts : the unperturbed one ( [ one ] ) and a term produced by the fluctuations of @xmath32    [ three ] @xmath72 @xmath73    where @xmath74 where @xmath75 means averaging over the probability distribution ( [ gauss ] ) . here",
    "@xmath76 have diagonal and off - diagonal parts .",
    "the former is responsible only for the inhomogeneous broadening of excitonic levels , while the latter couples the excitonic modes and , therefore , causes the localization effects .",
    "the @xmath76 undergo fluctuations because @xmath77 fluctuate . assuming nn coupling and that @xmath77 fluctuations are small in some sense ( see below )",
    ", we can find the @xmath76 distribution in an analytical form .",
    "this also helps us to comment on the results of numerical simulations that we discuss later in sec .",

    "we omit the details of tedious but straightforward trigonometric calculations and only quote the final results .",
    "it can be easily shown that the sum in eq .",
    "( [ def ] ) is exactly equal to zero if @xmath81 .",
    "particularly , this means that @xmath82 for @xmath83 when @xmath52 is taken to be odd , i.e. , the first order correction to the central energy is exactly equal to zero and does not fluctuate .",
    "fluctuations of the other @xmath76 are distributed according to the gaussian function with variances of the diagonal and off - diagonal elements distribution , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , given by    [ four ] @xmath86 , \\quad k\\ne \\frac{n+1}{2}. \\label{sigmad}\\ ] ] @xmath87 , \\quad k+k^\\prime \\ne n+1 . \\label{sigmand}\\ ] ]    from eqs .",
    "( [ four ] ) one can conclude that , in the case of off - diagonal disorder , the motion narrowing effect is also present as it takes place for diagonal disorder,@xcite i.e. , both magnitudes in ( [ four ] ) scale as @xmath88 .",
    "we should point out that , in contrast to diagonal disorder , here the magnitudes @xmath89 and @xmath90 are functions of the state numbers . note",
    "also that @xmath91 goes through its minimum value exactly at the center of the exciton band , i.e. , at @xmath92 and @xmath93 at @xmath52 taken odd and even , respectively .",
    "in fact , we can also assert this with respect to the value of @xmath94 since @xmath45 and @xmath95 can not differ greatly provided the condition @xmath96 .    to conclude this section",
    "let us comment on the validity of the motion narrowing effects .",
    "obviously , this is valid only when @xmath97 drives the motion narrowing effect rather than the whole number in the chain @xmath52 . in refs .   and   a self - consistent rule for estimation of @xmath98 is carried out .",
    "further , we will mainly focus our attention on the normalized density of states @xmath99 and on the degree of localization ( inverse participation ratio , ipr ) for the states at energy @xmath8 .",
    "they are defined respectively as follows  @xcite    @xmath100    @xmath101    where the angular brackets indicate an average over an ensemble of disordered linear chains and the @xmath102 is the eigenvector of the hamiltonian ( [ hn ] ) corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath103 with @xmath104 @xmath105 the ipr behaves like @xmath106 for delocalized states spreading uniformly over the entire system on increasing @xmath52 . in particular , the ipr can be exactly computed for the eigenstates of the periodic lattices given in ( [ k ] ) . in doing",
    "so we obtain the expected behavior for @xmath107 . on the contrary ,",
    "localized states exhibit much higher values . in the extreme case ,",
    "when the exciton is localized at a single site , the ipr becomes unity .",
    "therefore , the scaling analysis of the ipr as a function of the system size provides valuable information about the nature of the excitonic states .",
    "we should mention that a complete multifractal analysis , accomplished by studying the scaling of the other moments of the probability distribution , is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we have solved numerically the eigenvalue problem  ( [ eigen ] ) for different values of disorder , namely the mean fluctuation of the nn distance , @xmath108 , to study the features of both the dos and the ipr discussed above . in our numerical treatment @xmath109",
    "ranges from @xmath110 ( periodic lattices ) up to @xmath111 whereas the maximum system size we have considered is @xmath112 .",
    "results comprise averages over @xmath113 realizations of the disorder for each given pair of parameters @xmath52 and @xmath109 .",
    "let us comment the results we have obtained for the nn approximation .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the dos for the largest lattice size we have considered ( @xmath112 ) and different values of the disorder ( @xmath114 from top to bottom ) .",
    "we observe that the dos is symmetric about the center of the band .",
    "the singularities at the edge of the exciton band are smeared out on increasing the degree of disorder .",
    "interestingly , a sharp peak in the dos at the center of the exciton band appears when the degree of disorder exceeds some threshold value ( @xmath115 for our model parameters ) .",
    "we will discuss further this point later .",
    "we have also observed that the percentage of states in the dos peak increases with the degree of disorder .",
    "in addition , the amplitude of the peak rises noticeably with increasing the number of sites in the lattice , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] for @xmath116 .",
    "the ipr presents an overall increase when the degree of disorder increases , meaning that the larger the degree of disorder , the smaller the exciton localization length .",
    "this is clearly observed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we show the ipr as a function of the exciton energy for the same parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . however , the increase of the ipr strongly depends on the energy , being more pronounced close to the center of the band .",
    "simultaneously with the occurrence of the peak of the dos , a hardly visible downfall arises in the ipr at zero energy .",
    "this downfall is better revealed for larger lattices , as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for the same parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "as mentioned above , the scaling of the ipr with the lattice size may be useful to discern the nature of the eigenstates .",
    "the ipr at the center of the band for different values of the degree of disorder is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as a function of the lattice size .",
    "the ipr for periodic lattices scales very accurately as @xmath106 , hence indicating that their eigenstates spread uniformly over the whole lattice .",
    "as soon as some amount of disorder is introduced in the system , the ipr follows a power law for small @xmath52 but tends to a constant value for large @xmath52 , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . the critical size for which deviation from power fit occurs decreases on increasing the degree the disorder .",
    "the constant value of the ipr for large @xmath52 increases with the degree of disorder , indicating that the eigenstates at the center of the band actually become more localized .    summarizing these observations for the nn approximation ,",
    "we are led to two main conclusions .",
    "first , the zero - energy peak of the dos really exists .",
    "moreover , as its width shows no dependence on the degree of disorder ( at least , when the latter ranges over the interval used in our simulations ) , we are inclined to identify this peak with a @xmath3-like singularity rather than to the famous dyson singularity @xmath117 . this singularity was found firstly for a special distribution of the nn hopping integral in the form of a generalized poisson function.@xcite second , the corresponding eigenstates show no tendency to delocalization with rising the lattice size contrary to the opposite statement done in ref .  .",
    "moreover , they are not more delocalized than those of energies close to zero",
    ".      effects of inclusion of all dipolar interactions in eq .",
    "( [ eigen ] ) on the dos and ipr has been already discussed in ref .  .",
    "nevertheless , it has been done only for a fixed values of the chain length @xmath118 and the degree of disorder @xmath119 .",
    "below we present our dos and ipr numerical data obtained by varying both @xmath52 and @xmath120 .",
    "figures  [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] show the results of numerical calculations of both the dos and the ipr for different values of the degree of disorder and @xmath112 . here",
    ", one can observe the usual changes of both magnitudes as compared to those in the nn approximation : asymmetry and shift of the excitonic band edges , both in a good agreement with the analytical results presented in sec .",
    "in addition , some new features appear , namely the peak in the dos has a finite width and is shifted from zero - energy to a somewhat higher value @xmath121 for low degree of disorder , in full correspondence with the results of numerical simulation done in ref .  .",
    "higher values of the degree of disorder lead to a smaller energy shift .",
    "further , a peak in the ipr appears at the same energy where the dos peak , with a finite width as well .",
    "the last observation means that the states forming the dos peak become more localized as compared to those with close energies , in contrast to the case of the nn interaction .",
    "this is also confirmed by the scaling of the ipr for @xmath122 with the system size ( not shown here ) : in all cases we observe higher values of the ipr in comparison with those shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . besides that",
    ", the trend is similar , that is , the ipr scales as @xmath106 only for perfect lattices , whereas it tends to a constant value for non - zero degree of disorder .",
    "now let us discuss the origin of the features of the dos and of the ipr found in numerical simulations .",
    "obviously , the zero - energy peak in the dos might appear when the states at the center of the exciton band become localized , i.e. , their localization lengths are reduced to values less than the lattice size .",
    "this occurs when the reduced degree of disorder due to motion narrowing , @xmath123 , exceeds the energy spacing at the center of the band , @xmath124 .",
    "equalizing these two magnitudes one obtains an estimation for a _ threshold _ of mean fluctuations of the nn distances to observe the peak , @xmath125 .",
    "thus @xmath126 for @xmath112 , which is in a good agreement with the numerical data of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .    with regard to the fact why this peak appears",
    ", we can suggest two explanations which seem to be suitable for the model under consideration .",
    "first , as the distribution of disorder we used has long tails then , owing to possible large fluctuations of the nn distances , strongly interacting _ dimers _ can be created whose level splittings noticeably exceed the typical magnitude of the intersite interaction @xmath127 .",
    "consequently , the whole chain is broken into several independent segments in the sense that two adjacent _ dimers _ produce a potential well for the exciton , localizing it into the segment bounded by them .",
    "as the zero eigenenergy is always present in a segment with odd number of sites , one can expect a peak in the dos at this energy ( similar explanation of the zero - energy peak of the dos was suggested in ref .  ) .",
    "the peak amplitude increases with disorder simply because of the rising of the number of segments as the degree of disorder grows .",
    "appearance of such strongly interacting dimers is clearly seen from that the ipr approaches 0.5 at the dos tails ( see figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "recently , it was demonstrated that the dyson singularity of the dos appeared even for a box - like distribution of disorder.@xcite then , the explanation above fails due to the absence of large fluctuations of the nn - randomness at a low magnitude of the degree of disorder . in such a case , another cause for the occurrence of the zero - energy peak in the dos can be proposed . as we have already noted in subsection  [ b ] , the first order correction to the central energy is equal to zero for chains with odd number of sites and has a minimum of fluctuation in the case of even number of sites .",
    "the zero - energy peak indicates that the central band eigenenergies are more stable to perturbations than the remaining ones .",
    "this certainly will result in a peak of the dos after averaging over realizations of disorder .",
    "it is remarkable that simulations done for a special type of disorder which has no effect on a certain excitonic level in the sense that the first order correction to the energy vanishes show an analogous peak in the dos at this energy.@xcite thus , this _ empirical _ rule can serve for inspecting the appearance of peaks in the dos for the tight - binding hamiltonian .",
    "as the last treatment does not use any specific peculiarities of the nn - randomness distribution , it seems to be suitable for any other distribution .",
    "we suppose that , for the model considered in this paper , both mechanisms discussed above contribute to the formation of the zero - energy peak in the dos .    concluding this subsection , note that the degree of localization of the central states obtained from the numerical simulation is in a good agreement with the theoretical estimates based on a self - consistent rule proposed in refs .   and",
    "( see paragraph 1 of the present subsection ) .      as it was stated in ref .",
    ", the energy shift of the dos peak , @xmath128 , agrees very well with the energy of the central band state in the absence of disorder , eq .",
    "( [ epeak ] ) .",
    "we are also inclined to relate this peculiarity to a state of analogous origin , i.e. , similar to @xmath129 .",
    "this can be demonstrated at least in the perturbative limit . moreover , exploiting this analogy further , we should assume that the character ( having no amplitude on the half of sites ) of the mentioned eigenstate has not to be changed dramatically ( at least , in average ) , when passing from the nn model to the exact one , as it is the case for the problem without disorder.@xcite    the @xmath3-singularity of the dos becomes broader with including all dipolar couplings .",
    "at least two effects can contribute to this broadening . as it was supposed above , the dos peak results from the isolated segments of odd number of sites , which , in turn , originate from large fluctuations of the nn distances .",
    "at moderate magnitudes of disorder we are mainly dealing with , it is unlikely the simultaneous strong reduction of the distance between a nearest - neighbor pair and the distances with other neighbors .",
    "thus , for the very beginning , one can consider adjacent segments as independent of each other .",
    "then , the eigenenergy of the local ( belonging to a certain segment ) central band state will fluctuate , owing to fluctuations of the segment lengths [ see eq .",
    "( [ epeak ] ) ] , and thus will produce inhomogeneous broadening of the dos peak .",
    "the second probable origin of this effect is the coupling of different isolated segments due to the interaction with far neighbors .    in ref .",
    ", the appearance of the ipr peak was explained by an exceptional property of this characteristic with regard to the central band state , @xmath130 , characterized by the wave function @xmath131^{1/2}\\sin(\\pi n/2)$ ] . even in the absence of disorder , the ipr defined by eq .",
    "( [ ipr ] ) shows stronger localization of this state @xmath132 $ ] as compared to localization of the remaining states @xmath133$].@xcite the authors of ref",
    ".   asserted that the ipr peak in the presence of disorder reflected a remnant of this special state in those forming the peak . at the moment",
    ", we do not see any other explanation of the origin of this anomaly .",
    "if it is so , the similar feature might be manifested in the nn problem , too .",
    "nevertheless , as follows from our simulations done for the nn problem , the ipr displays a downfall rather than a peak .",
    "one of the reason for such difference may be the fact that the zero - energy state is not exponentially localized in the nn problem ( see sec .  [ ? ] ) .",
    "it results in a larger extension of this state as compared to the others . in principle",
    ", such a large extension can compensate the ipr anomaly coming from the special character of the zero - energy state ( having no amplitude at all on the half of sites ) giving rise to the same value of the ipr at @xmath134 and at surrounding energies .",
    "the numerical study of the problem of the zero - energy peak of the dos for a one - dimensional frenkel chain with only off - diagonal randomness shows that the peak is really presented . in the nn approximation , it is located at the center of the excitonic band and tends to convert to a @xmath3-singularity as the size of the chain increases .",
    "the states belonging the peak are localized and do not display any tendency to delocalization with the chain size . moreover",
    ", the degree of localization ( ipr ) does not differ very much from that of the surrounding states .",
    "the inclusion of couplings due to far neighbors shifts the peak to a slightly higher energy ( @xmath135 ) , while the ipr , in contrast to the nn problem , shows a peak at the same energy .",
