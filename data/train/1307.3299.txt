    "it goes without saying that experiments with great technical accomplishment should be evaluated with data analysis of equal or better quality . during the past year or so ,",
    "the achievement of constructing multiple , nearly identical neutrino detectors by the daya bay @xcite and reno reno collaborations has been rightly praised as a technological breakthrough . beyond increasing data rates",
    ", the prime function of the new technology is to reduce systematic errors .",
    "systematic errors previously dominated neutrino oscillation experiments with nuclear reactor sources for many years . yet by a curious gap in the current literature , the data analysis published to quantify the neutrino mixing angle @xcite @xmath1 is far from optimal . applying more effective methods to the analysis can yield higher resolution of neutrino physics parameters than currently available . despite lacking complete access to the full information",
    ", we can make a case for producing better determination of @xmath2 and its uncertainties than the experimental reports .",
    "we are naturally surprised by this fact .",
    "it is primarily due to unrecognized faults in the inefficient methods used before .",
    "the experimental uncertainties on @xmath1 have been the center of attention for years after the chooz null results of 1999 and 2003 chooz .",
    "uncertainties remained the focus after the upgraded double chooz @xcite report of new results just before daya bay s and reno s results , their improved , 2.9@xmath3 result a few months later dchooz2 , and a recent result consistent with all previous measurements , but using the delayed neutron capture from hydrogen for the first time dchooz3 .",
    "what has gone largely unnoticed is that the statistical method used in these papers diverged significantly from most previous work , can not directly be compared , and shows signals of being problematic .",
    "there usually exists more than one `` correct forms '' of data analysis .",
    "most physicists agree one should not be overly concerned with any method , provided the assumptions are reported , that the method is robust under small perturbations , and that the results are reproducible",
    ". we will present such a method analyzing the daya bay data .",
    "the method includes _ stating a specific hypothesis _ , which may appear quaint , but if neglected leads to no hypothesis to test .",
    "the method uses few rather than many parameters , and we report everything needed to reproduce our calculations .",
    "remarkably , the current experimental literature on @xmath4 is not definite on any hypothesis , is not reproducible , and its approach does not appear robust under small model parameters that can be freely adjusted .",
    "once the ground rules are defined , quantifying confidence levels with goodness of fit statistics becomes meaningful . without ground rules and reproducibility",
    "the dependence of a statistic on a parameter has little objective meaning .",
    "the tendency to name all statistics `` @xmath5 '' regardless of their actual definition does not make them all equivalent .",
    "when the meaning and values of parameters are omitted from discussion , it is impossible to know whether or not they are `` nuisance parameters . '' a _ textbook _ nuisance parameter is one whose value is completely irrelevant to the hypothesis , but which must be accounted for in the analysis of the parameters that are relevant .",
    "meanwhile there are few if any textbook nuisance parameters in experimental physics .",
    "every parameter has a physical meaning .",
    "if a data fit finds a parameter far from expectations , it indicates something is wrong , whether or not the nuisance is annoying .",
    "such a nuisance parameter can invalidate the entire study , depending on its value . unless one finds a reason otherwise , it is unavoidable that both the `` uninteresting '' and the `` interesting '' parameters contribute to the actual hypothesis and its uncertainties .",
    "the upshot is that using extra parameters will carry a statistical penalty if one cares about them .",
    "extra parameters should not be used if one does not care about them . having it both ways",
    "is a impossible for us to defend .",
    "after the first version of this paper @xcite , we undertook a literature search to review the history .",
    "it turns out that the references of the daya bay experimental proposal @xcite actually employed a more conservative determination of confidence regions , consistent with ours and contradicting the method daya bay used when the data appeared .",
    "this is discussed further in section [ sec : regions ] .",
    "section [ sec : straight ] begins with a simple straightforward procedure with a clearly stated hypothesis including a list of parameters central to the hypothesis .",
    "we will discover an opportunity to retrospectively re - classify a parameter as a nuisance after it was fit and found consistent with expectations .",
    "since that step would abolish the original test conditions , we can not find a way to justify it .",
    "the hypothetical case that our fit stands on a better footing than daya bay hinges on the fact we account for all our parameters and pay the statistical penalty up front : plus our calculations are reproducible .",
    "section [ sec : chipull ] sets up an illustration of the _ method of @xmath6 with pull _",
    "@xcite that has become the exclusive tool of analysis by the experimental collaborations cited .",
    "the method uses many parameters of physical importance , and also turns out to be remarkably sensitive to fine details of tuning external parameters .",
    "we explore the method while stating our assumptions , sticking to them , and also provide all the information to reproduce our calculations .",
    "this fills a gap in the neutrino literature where the procedures of assigning errors have not been spelled out for the users of the data .",
    "when we compare our results following standard procedures with the number of data points and ( very large ) number of parameters used by daya bay and reno there is a unexplained discrepancy .",
    "we can not explain what hypothesis those experimental groups are assuming , nor find it stated anywhere .",
    "the section also explains how , paradoxically , a definite _ insensitivity _ of @xmath6 defined in that approach is not the virtue it appears .",
    "excessive parameters tends to degrade the determination of the physical objective , @xmath0 .",
    "due to this situation , there is enough leeway in the current determination of @xmath1 to make two logical but contradictory arguments .",
    "it is possible to find the uncertainty of @xmath1 has been greatly _ underestimated _ , and it is also possible to find the uncertainty has been significantly _",
    "overestimated_. though we are obviously not in a position to resolve the alternatives , we find it fascinating to understand the issues and develop means to assess the situation .",
    "that leads to our main conclusion ( section [ sec : discuss ] ) that simpler methods are preferred , both for scientific and mathematical reasons .",
    "an appendix gives details on how we extracted data from the publications .",
    "for our first example we present a straightforward , simple model .",

    "we can not avoid @xmath15 and need to determine it self - consistently .",
    "our null hypothesis is that @xmath15 is of order @xmath16 , and that @xmath17 the point of fitting the data will be to find whether the null model can be ruled out , and compute confidence levels on the two parameters fit relative to the null model used .",

    "we have seen no specific discussion of the wide range of results that can be obtained simply by adjusting the pull - width parameters .",
    "our hypothesis to fit data with the method must be abandoned because the range of possible values we can find greatly exceeds the range of any error bars from the same analysis .      once the pull - width parameters are set somehow , attention shifts to the change in @xmath5 from varying pull parameters near the minimum .",

    "actually we found that the analysis methods in wide use , by becoming so complicated , have not come close to optimizing the precision of @xmath24 .    what is gained by a multi - parameter fit ?",
    "compared to our simple fit , the accomplishment from 18 additional parameters used by @xmath7 is a change of @xmath5 by 1.3 units .",
    "suppose one finds a logical argument ( which we ve not seen ) for classifying all parameters as irrelevant nuisances , except the mixing angle of great interest . then using @xmath80 to evaluate @xmath81 would be appropriate",
    ". meanwhile the hidden penalty of 18 extra parameters tends to decrease the precision of @xmath30 , not increase it .",
    "we do nt find that necessary or welcome .",
    "multi - parameter studies are common in simulating and de - bugging hardware .",
    "we believe the information from daya bay s 20 parameter fit is that numerous parameters that might have detected significant systematic errors were found to be small .",
    "this is a guess about parameter information those in the field need to know .",
    "( the facts are actually unknown so long as the full set of fitting parameters is unavailable . ) if the guess regarding systematic errors is correct , it is a wonderful result indicating brilliantly constructed hardware .",
    "physicists interested in neutrino physics know and expect that internal studies of hardware systematics might involve 10 or 20 or 100 parameters laboriously checked and double - checked . and",
    "this is supposed to be done before `` opening the box '' to look at the physical parameter of interest .",
    "there is no logical necessity to mix the two different goals .",
    "indeed it would be disappointing if the level of analysis of systematic errors by @xmath7 and reno consisted solely of the unconvincing method ( in our opinion ) of @xmath82 presented in published work .    to reiterate this",
    ", our analysis finds that a hardware study is far from the best way to fit @xmath30 .",
    "once systematic errors _ are known independently and with good reliability _ to be small , a few - parameter method tends to be a more effective way to evaluate @xmath30 and its errors .",
    "this , and the previous material , explain the remark earlier that the errors in @xmath30 can be viewed as both under - estimated and over - estimated . if outsiders to the experiment were to present a 20-parameter fit , we believe no credence would be given unless the results were assessed with @xmath83 , if not an even more demanding standard .",
    "the significance of detecting @xmath84 with 32 units of @xmath81 would then be reduced to an equivalent @xmath85 effect , and errors computed using @xmath86 would be considered _ under_-estimated . meanwhile using 20 parameters",
    "has also so flattened the @xmath5 function by near degeneracies , that it has diluted the impact of data on the measurement . on that basis",
    "it is an approach wastefully _ over_-estimating the errors of the competing physical parameter .",

    ". it would be good for the experimental groups to present straightforward , simple fits where all definitions are complete , all variables are reported , data is divulged , and results are reproducible . simplicity and transparency will greatly assist the main interest in neutrino data , which is the comparison of experiments with competing models of the underlying physics .    *",
