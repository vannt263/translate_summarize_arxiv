    "consider a passive scalar @xmath0 which is advected by a time - dependent , divergence - free velocity field @xmath1 on the two - dimensional torus , i.e. , a solution @xmath0 of the continuity equation with velocity field @xmath1 : @xmath2 we assume that the initial datum @xmath3 satisfies @xmath4 ( this condition is , at least formally , preserved under the time evolution ) and we are interested in the mixing behaviour of @xmath5 as @xmath6 tends to @xmath7 .    in order to quantify the level of `` mixedness '' , two different notions of mixing scale are available in the literature .",
    "the first one is based on homogeneous negative sobolev norms ( see for instance @xcite ) , the most common one being the @xmath8 norm , which should be viewed as a characteristic length of the mixing in the system ( here and in the following we use the dot as in @xmath8 to denote the _ homogeneous _ sobolev norm ) :    the functional mixing scale of @xmath5 is @xmath9 .    the second notion ( see @xcite ) is geometric and has been introduced for solutions with value @xmath10 :    given @xmath11 , the geometric mixing scale of @xmath5 is the infimum @xmath12 of all @xmath13 such that for every @xmath14 there holds @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the two - dimensional lebesgue measure and @xmath17 is the ball of radius @xmath18 centered at @xmath19 .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 is fixed and plays a minor role in the definition .",
    "informally , in order for @xmath5 to have geometric mixing scale @xmath12 , we require that every ball of radius @xmath12 contains a substantial portion of both level sets @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "although , strictly speaking , the two notions above are not equivalent ( see the discussion in @xcite ) , they are heuristically very related , and indeed most of the results in this area are available considering any of the two definitions .",
    "the mixing process is studied in the literature under energetic constraints on the velocity field , that is , assuming that the velocity field is bounded with respect to some spatial norm , uniformly in time .",
    "we now briefly review some of the related literature ( most of the results hold indeed in any space dimension ) :    * the velocity field @xmath1 is bounded in @xmath23 uniformly in time for some @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( the case @xmath26 , @xmath27 , often referred to as energy - constrained flow , is of particular interest in applications ) . in this case",
    "the cauchy problem for the continuity equation  ( [ e : continuity ] ) is not uniquely solvable in general ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore possible to find a velocity field and a bounded solution which is non - zero at the initial time , but is identically zero at some later time .",
    "this fact means that it is possible to have perfect mixing in finite time , as already observed in @xcite and established in @xcite for @xmath26 , building on an example from @xcite . *",
    "the velocity field @xmath1 is bounded in @xmath28 uniformly in time for some @xmath25 ( the case @xmath27 , often referred to as enstrophy - constrained flow , is of particular interest in applications ) . in this case",
    "the results in @xcite ensure uniqueness for the cauchy problem  ( [ e : continuity ] ) , while for @xmath29 the quantitative lipschitz estimates for regular lagrangian flows in @xcite provide an exponential lower bound on the geometric mixing scale , @xmath30 .",
    "the extension to the borderline case @xmath31 is still open ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "for the same class of velocity fields , an exponential lower bound for the functional mixing scale , @xmath32 , has been proved in @xcite . * for velocity fields bounded in @xmath33 uniformly in time , the results in @xcite ensure uniqueness for the cauchy problem  ( [ e : continuity ] ) .",
    "it was recognized in @xcite that an exponential decay of the geometric mixing scale can indeed be attained for velocity fields bounded in @xmath33 uniformly in time , and actually the same example works also for the functional mixing scale . *",
    "the velocity field @xmath1 is bounded in @xmath34 uniformly in time for some @xmath35 ( here the case of interest in applications is that of palenstrophy - constrained flows , that is , @xmath36 and @xmath27 ) . in this case",
    "there are no better lower bounds for the decay of the ( functional or geometric ) mixing scale than the exponential one obtained for @xmath37 .",
    "the common belief , supported also by the numerical simulations in @xcite , is that this bound is optimal .    in this note",
    "we sketch two examples in which both the functional and the geometric mixing scales decay exponentially with a velocity field bounded in @xmath28 uniformly in time ( for every @xmath38 in the first example , and for every @xmath39 in the second example , thus including the lipschitz case ) .",
    "these results show the sharpness of the lower bounds in @xcite ( point  ( b ) above ) , for the full range @xmath40 .",
    "our examples can be seen as a sobolev ( or even lipschitz ) variant of the example in point  ( c ) .",
    "moreover , we describe how such constructions can be employed to obtain counterexamples to the propagation of any fractional sobolev regularity for solutions to the continuity equation  ( [ e : continuity ] ) in @xmath41 , when the velocity field belongs to sobolev classes that do not embed in the lipschitz space .    after the completion of the present work we were made aware of a related result obtained independently by yao and zlato @xcite , which provides examples of mixing of general initial data , with a rate that is optimal in the range @xmath42 for some @xmath43 .",
    "a conceivable procedure to mix an initial datum is through a self - similar evolution .",
    "we fix @xmath44 and @xmath45 and assume the following :    [ ass ]    there exist a velocity field @xmath46 and a solution @xmath47 to  ( [ e : continuity ] ) , both defined for @xmath48 , such that :    * @xmath46 is bounded in @xmath49 uniformly in time ; * @xmath47 is bounded ; * there exists a constant @xmath50 , with @xmath51 an integer , such that @xmath52    we will give an explicit example of a @xmath46 and a @xmath47 satisfying this assumption ( with @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) in section [ sec:2 ] . given a positive parameter @xmath55 to be determined later , we set for each integer @xmath56 and for @xmath57 $ ] : @xmath58 it is easy to check that @xmath59 solves  ( [ e : continuity ] ) with velocity field @xmath60 and that , because of assumption  [ ass](iii ) , @xmath61    now we construct @xmath1 and @xmath0 by patching together the velocity fields @xmath62 and the corresponding solutions @xmath63 in other words , we define @xmath64 where @xmath65 observe that @xmath1 and @xmath0 are defined for @xmath66 , and that , thanks to equation  ( [ e : glue ] ) , @xmath0 is a solution of the cauchy problem  ( [ e : continuity ] ) with velocity field @xmath1 and initial condition @xmath67 .",
    "( see figure [ f : self ] . )     taking only two values . ]    since @xmath68 by setting @xmath69 we obtain that @xmath1 is bounded in @xmath70 uniformly in time .",
    "moreover , @xmath71 that is , @xmath72    there are now three cases :    * @xmath24 , then @xmath73 . in this case , @xmath74 is finite and @xmath75 as @xmath76 , that is , we have perfect mixing in finite time ; * @xmath53 , then @xmath77 . in this case , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , therefore the inequality @xmath80 in  ( [ e : decay ] ) becomes @xmath81 , and the estimate in  ( [ e : decay ] ) yields the following exponential decay of the functional mixing scale : @xmath82 * @xmath35 , then @xmath83 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath78 and @xmath84 hence , reasoning as above , ( [ e : decay ] ) yields the following polynomial decay : @xmath85^{-\\frac{1}{s-1}}}{\\lambda } \\simeq c(m,\\lambda , s ) \\ , t^{-\\frac{1}{s-1 } } \\,.\\ ] ]    to summarize , we have proved the following :    [ t : main ] given @xmath86 and @xmath87 , under assumption  [ ass ] , there exist a velocity field @xmath1 and a solution @xmath0 of the cauchy problem ( [ e : continuity ] ) , such that @xmath1 is bounded in @xmath23 uniformly in time and the functional mixing scale of @xmath0 exhibits the following behavior depending on @xmath86 :    * perfect mixing in finite time ; * exponential decay ; * polynomial decay .    in the above construction we can take @xmath47 with values @xmath10 ;",
    "in this case , using that for @xmath88 the solution @xmath5 is periodic on @xmath89 with period @xmath90 , we can easily prove that the geometric mixing scale @xmath12 exhibits the same behavior of the functional mixing scale detailed in theorem  [ t : main ] .",
    "note that for @xmath35 our self - similar examples do not match the known exponential lower bound for the ( geometric and functional ) mixing scale , which is supposed to be optimal .",
    "it is possible to construct an example of a velocity field @xmath46 and a solution @xmath47 satisfying assumption  [ ass ] by considering a shear flow that splits a ball into two pieces , afterward rearranged into two smaller balls .",
    "this is essentially the nature of the example in @xcite .",
    "note that such a shear flow is discontinuous along a line and indeed it is of class @xmath91 but not of class @xmath92 .    in order to obtain a sobolev velocity field",
    "one could consider a `` modulated '' shear flow of the type @xmath93 , for which the `` total advection '' @xmath94 is a characteristic function .",
    "however , such a construction can not be achieved ( even ) with @xmath95 . and",
    "indeed the examples with sobolev regularity we present will be genuinely two - dimensional .",
    "the first example shows that assumption  [ ass ] can be fulfilled for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we will actually only describe the time evolution of a set in @xmath89 for @xmath48 ; then @xmath47 will be the function taking the value @xmath96 on the set and @xmath97 on the complement , and @xmath46 will be a velocity field that realizes such an evolution . given the evolution of the set , the velocity field @xmath46 is provided by the following lemma , except at the time(s ) when a singularity occurs in the geometric evolution :    [ sel ] given a smooth set evolving smoothly in time , such that the area of each connected component is constant in time , there exists a smooth , divergence - free velocity field the flow of which deforms the set according to the given evolution .",
    "[ ex : bottle ]    we consider the geometric evolution described in figure  [ f : pinching ] ; the velocity field @xmath46 realizing this evolution can be taken bounded in @xmath28 , for any given @xmath38 , uniformly in time .        the evolution is smooth except at the times",
    "at which a connected component of the set is split in two .",
    "this splitting is realized by first creating a small tube - like region in the connected component , which is then pinched , thus separating the component into two parts .",
    "one way to achieve the pinching with the correct regularity for the velocity field is to impose a horizontal compression with a square root - like velocity along the horizontal diameter of the ball , which is therefore shrunk to a single point in finite time . in order to obtain a ( globally ) divergence - free velocity field",
    ", this horizontal compression has to be compensated by a vertical decompression .",
    "the details of the construction are actually quite involved , therefore we leave them for a forthcoming paper .",
    "although the results in @xcite guarantee the uniqueness of a suitable `` flow solution '' for sobolev velocity fields and for velocity fields with bounded variation , we see in example  [ ex : bottle ] that the set of initial data lacking _ pointwise _ uniqueness may contain a full line , and that the flow does not preserve topological properties of sets such as connectedness .",
    "since the evolution in example  [ ex : bottle ] does not preserve connectedness , clearly it can not be implemented with a lipschitz velocity field .",
    "our second example has lipschitz regularity and strictly speaking is not self - similar ; rather , it consists of two basic elements , which ( up to rotations ) are replicated at each step at finer scales .",
    "what we do is reminiscent of the construction of the classical peano curve filling the square ( again , we leave the details for a forthcoming paper ) .",
    "[ ex : snake ]    the basic moves of the construction are illustrated in figure  [ f : snake ] .",
    "we start from a straight strip at time @xmath98 . using lemma  [ sel ]",
    ", the strip is rearranged into the meandering strip at @xmath99 , which consists of `` straight '' and `` curved '' pieces .        in the time interval from @xmath99 to @xmath100 the set evolves as follows : the `` straight pieces '' are evolved employing the same transformation ( possibly together with a rotation ) used from @xmath98 to @xmath99 , while the `` curved pieces '' are rearranged as shown in figure  [ f : snake ] for the right upper corner at @xmath99 , again using lemma  [ sel ] . notice that at every step our picture contains only `` straight pieces '' and `` curved pieces '' , therefore the entire evolution is determined by the two basic moves in figure  [ f : snake ] .",
    "although lacking exact self - similarity , the fact that only two basic elements are repeated allows to follow the analysis in section  [ s : scaling ] and to prove that both the functional and geometric mixing scales decay exponentially in time .",
    "we finally describe how to employ the above constructions to obtain counterexamples to the propagation of any fractional sobolev regularity for solutions to the continuity equation  ( [ e : continuity ] ) in @xmath41 .",
    "first of all , we observe that the construction in example  [ ex : snake ] can be modified to obtain a divergence - free velocity field @xmath101 and a solution @xmath102 to problem  ( [ e : continuity ] ) , so that    * both @xmath1 and @xmath0 are supported in the unit cube @xmath103 ( in space ) ; * @xmath1 is bounded in @xmath104 uniformly in time ; * @xmath105 for all @xmath106 and some positive constant @xmath107 .",
    "since the @xmath108 norm of @xmath0 is conserved in time , the interpolation inequality @xmath109 gives @xmath110 this our example `` saturates '' the gronwall estimate @xmath111 .",
    "then , given a disjoint family @xmath112 of cubes in @xmath113 with side @xmath114 , we can consider in each @xmath112 ( suitable translations of ) the rescaled velocity fields and the solutions @xmath115 and define @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "it is immediate to check that such @xmath118 solves the continuity equation  ( [ e : continuity ] ) with velocity field @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , thanks to the exponential growth in  ( [ e : saturation ] ) , we can choose the construction parameters @xmath120 so to impose a certain regularity of the velocity field @xmath119 and of the initial datum @xmath121 on the one hand , and ensure an instantaneous loss of any sobolev regularity for the solution @xmath122 on the other hand .",
    "more precisely :    we can choose the construction parameters so that :    * the velocity field @xmath119 is bounded in @xmath123 uniformly in time , for any given @xmath124 ; * the initial datum @xmath125 belongs to @xmath126 ; * the solution @xmath122 does not belong to @xmath127 for any @xmath106 and @xmath128 .",
    "moreover both @xmath119 and @xmath118 are compactly supported in space , and can be taken smooth on the complement of a point in @xmath113 .",
    "also in the case of velocity fields bounded in @xmath129 uniformly in time our construction gives some loss of regularity of the initial datum , provided that @xmath129 does not embed in @xmath130 .",
