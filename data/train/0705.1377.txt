    "the classification of dynamic universality classes and the determination of their scaling dimensions is one of the central issues in current research of non - equilibrium statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the one - species asymmetric exclusion processes ( asep ) serves in this context as both the simplest prototype model for driven one - dimensional ( 1d ) stochastic particle flow @xcite and as a fully discretized version of the 1d burgers equation ( with time and space discretized , and momentum quantized ) @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how the properties of such stochastic flows change with the introduction of additional bulk conservation laws .",
    "the generic expectation is that enforcing more conservation laws changes the scaling dimensions .",
    "we follow a bottom - up approach .",
    "an example of a top - down approach is the current interest in anomalous 1d heat conduction in fermi - pasta - ulam type models ( e.g. , a chain of anharmonic oscillators @xcite , or a one dimensional gas of particles in a narrow channel with different types of interactions @xcite ) .",
    "the systems are coupled to heat reservoirs on either end .",
    "those are held at different temperatures and thus induce heat flow along the channel .",

    "we add conservation laws to the burgers equation instead of coarse graining down from full hydrodynamics .",
    "the equivalences between asep , kpz growth , and the burgers equation are well known @xcite .",
    "asep is usually interpreted as a process for stochastic particle transport , while the burgers equation @xmath9\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] represents the evolution of a ( vortex free ) velocity field @xmath10 , and conserves momentum only @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of asep as a fully discretized burgers equation poses some conceptional issues .",
    "due to the full quantization of the momenta in asep , in units of @xmath11 , it can appear that the process also conserves energy .",
    "a careful discussion @xcite shows that energy is conserved between updates but fluctuates during each update .",
    "therefore asep is a genuine fully discretized implementation of the burgers equation from this direct point of view as well . in section [ ahr ]",
    "we discuss how to impose conservation of particles in addition to conservation of momentum .",
    "this leads naturally to the two - species asep known as the arndt - heinzel - rittenberg ( ahr ) model @xcite .",
    "this process has been the focus of intensive studies , but its dynamic scaling properties seem to have been ignored . instead , the stationary state properties have been center stage , in particular its clustering , and that it can be constructed exactly using the so - called matrix product ansatz method @xcite .",
    "we establish that the introduction of this additional conservation law to asep does not change the universality class , but it does so in a rather intricate manner .",
    "kpz scaling changes to ( kpz)@xmath12 type scaling .",
    "the ahr process can be interpreted as a coupled burgers and diffusion equation , conserving both mass and momentum ; or as two coupled burgers equations , one for positive and negative momentum quanta separately .",
    "the latter point of view turns out to be the most productive . at large",
    "length scales the coupling vanishes and the process factorizes , in terms of quasi - particles , into two decoupled burger processes .",

    "we use that property to prove analytically that the perfect screening is rigorous ( section [ mpa ] ) . in sections",

    "our aim is to construct a generalization of asep describing a process where particle diffusion and the burgers equation are coupled to each other .",
    "energy will not be conserved .",
    "the particles in such a model need to carry an internal degree of freedom , representing momentum .",
    "a site could be in four states",
    ". it would be empty ( @xmath14 ) or be occupied by a particle ( @xmath15 ) with momentum @xmath16 .",
    "particles with @xmath17 ( -1 ) momentum would hop with a right ( left ) bias . some reflection on the nature of the passing processes ( the collisions ) shows that we can remove the zero momentum state of particles , without loss of generality @xcite .",
    "this then leads naturally to the two - species asep known as the arndt - heinzel - rittenberg ( ahr ) model .",
    "the conventional interpretation of this process is in terms of diffusion of charged particles in an electric field .",
    "two species of particles with opposite unit charge hop in opposite directions along a 1d lattice ring , driven by the electric field .",

    "@xmath24 is the free directed hopping rate ( the electric field ) and @xmath25 the passing rate of opposite charged particles . in our study , the numbers of @xmath21 and @xmath22 particles on the ring are chosen to be equal .",
    "compared to the conventional single species asep , this process has two local conservation laws instead of one ; both species are conserved independently .    in the coupled diffusion - burgers equation interpretation of the same process , the charge represents a quantum of momentum moving in opposite direction as illustrated in fig.[growth - asep ] .",
    "no driving force is present , because the preferred hopping direction represents the total derivative in the navier - stokes equation , just as in the single species asep .",
    "similar to asep , energy is not a conserved quantity : the energy of particles is conserved between updates but fluctuates during the updates . that leaves particles in different places than where they would have been if energy were conserved @xcite .",
    "the ahr model reduces to the @xmath26 spin ( momentum quanta ) representation of asep in the high density limit where vacant sites @xmath23 are absent .",
    "there , the particle density can not fluctuate anymore , and the process falls thus back to the burgers equation with only one conservation law .",
    "this limit is singular .",
    "the ahr process is not the generic @xmath27 generalization of asep in the sense of the kpz and burgers equation .",
    "the proper generalization would be the so - called restricted solid - on - solid ( rsos ) model ( kim - kosterlitz model ) where @xmath28 and @xmath29 pairs can be annihilated and created .",
    "those processes conserve momentum .",
    "the @xmath30 ( @xmath22 ) particles represent up ( down ) steps in the kpz type interface , the free hopping rate @xmath24 represents step - flow .",
    "growth at flat terraces is blocked in the ahr process , except for the deposition of vertical dimers ( with rate @xmath25 ) in single particle puddles .",
    "fig.[growth - asep ] illustrates this .",
    "this means that from the kpz point of view the ahr process represents a growing interface where the number of up and down steps are individually preserved .",
    "whether this local conservation law changes the scaling dimensions on large scales is the central issue we address here . from the kpz perspective",

    "the same is true in the projected subspace where @xmath29 particles are blind to the difference between empty sites and @xmath28 particles .",
    "these subspaces are not perpendicular and the process does not factorize into two independent asep processes .",

    "we will study this numerically in the next section and find that at large length scales the process factorizes after all , into @xmath43 .    at @xmath44 the particles can still pretend to be blind to the other species , but then experience updates where the hopping probability inexplicably changes from @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",

    "first we review briefly the general properties of mpa stationary states .",

    "stationary states of stochastic dynamic processes are typically very complex with intricate long - range effective interactions between the degrees of freedom ( when writing the stationary state in terms of effective gibbs - boltzmann factors ) .",
    "the long - range aspect is important ; 1d driven stochastic processes can undergo non - trivial phase transitions , while 1d equilibrium degrees of freedom with short - range interactions can not .",
    "mpa states are linked to equilibrium distributions and therefore lack long - range correlations .",
    "mpa stationary states are of the form @xcite : @xmath154 \\label{mpa - eq}\\ ] ] with in our case @xmath155 .",
    "this structure resembles closely the transfer matrix formulation of partition functions in one dimensional ( 1d ) equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "consider for example a one dimensional ising model , with spin @xmath156 degrees of freedom at sites @xmath157 , that interact as @xmath158 and with a degree of freedom @xmath159 on every bond @xmath160 such that bond energy @xmath161 can have three distinct values . in that case , the @xmath162 are @xmath163 transfer matrices and the stationary state probability for the yet unrelated stochastic dynamic process is the ising equilibrium partition function for a given @xmath164 configuration , @xmath165 the normalization factor @xmath166 is the canonical partition function of the annealed random bond 1d ising model .",
    "the stochastic driven non - equilibrium dynamics typically imposes constraints on the @xmath167 degrees of freedom . in our dynamic process",
    "the number of each species of particle , @xmath168 , is conserved independently .",
    "this is denoted by @xmath169 in eq.([partition1 ] ) .",
    "the @xmath170 variables do not couple to each other directly in eq.([partition ] ) ; all correlations between @xmath170 degrees of freedom are mediated by the ising field @xmath171 .",
    "the search for a possible mpa structure of the stationary state is therefore the search for the existence of a representation in which all correlations between the original @xmath170 degrees of freedom are carried by a new auxiliary field and expressed as short - range interactions between those new degrees of freedom .",
    "those auxiliary degrees of freedom can take any form , not just ising spins , because the rank of the @xmath172 matrices and their symmetries can be arbitrary .",
    "for example in our case , the rank will be infinite , and the auxiliary field can be interpreted as ( integer valued ) interface type degrees of freedom , denoted as @xmath173 .    the transfer matrix product structure , eq.([mpa - eq ] )",
    ", implies that those auxiliary degrees of freedom interact by nearest neighbor interactions only .",
    "this is actually unfortunate , because in short - ranged 1d equilibrium systems , like eq.([partition ] ) , spontaneous broken symmetries and phase transitions are impossible .",
    "therefore , master equations with mpa stationary states have at best dynamic phase transitions with trivial scaling properties ( associated with an abrupt change in the @xmath172-representation ) . for example",
    ", mpa representations of directed percolation or directed ising type processes can not exist , because both are believed to have transitions with complex scaling dimensions .",
    "still , the mpa method has been proved to be a powerful tool , its algebraic structure is very elegant , and a surprisingly large class of 1d stochastic dynamic processes have a mpa type stationary state .",
    "boundary conditions play an important role .",
    "eq.([partition1 ] ) is a canonical partition function , where the number of @xmath28 and @xmath29 particles are each conserved .",
    "consider instead the generating function @xmath174 = tr[m^l ] \\label{grandpartition}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath175 this would be the grand canonical partition function of , e.g. , the above annealed random bond 1d ising model in case of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "@xmath176 are the fugacities of the @xmath177 particles .",
    "the equivalence between the ensembles in the thermodynamic limit is ensured in the equilibrium interpretation , where the details of how the particle reservoirs couple to the system does not have to be addressed .",
    "this is different in the interpretation of the mpa as the stationary state of a driven stochastic process .",
    "dynamic processes are very sensitive to boundary conditions . for example",
    ", a process with open boundary conditions and reservoirs at the edges conserves the number of particles everywhere inside the bulk , and behaves very different from the one where the reservoirs couple directly to every site .",
    "not surprisingly therefore , the mpa method only applies to the stationary state ; the introduction of the auxiliary field does not address the stochastic dynamics , nor the temporal fluctuations in the stationary state .",
    "for periodic boundary conditions , as in our case , the grand canonical partition function eq.([grandpartition ] ) represents an ensemble of dynamic systems , each with periodic boundary condition systems , and fixed values of @xmath178 and @xmath179 , weighted with respect to each other by the fugacity probability factor . in this sense",
    "the ensembles are equivalent in the thermodynamic limit . in our discussion below",
    "we use the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the correlation functions for @xmath63 are evaluated then as @xmath180 \\label{correl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the thermodynamic limit , with @xmath181 and @xmath182 the right and left eigenvectors of the largest eigenvalue @xmath183 of the operator @xmath184 defined in eq.([transfer ] ) .",
    "the correlator at @xmath93 , @xmath185 , poses somewhat of a problem .",
    "it can not be expressed as simple as this due to the intrinsic off - diagonal character of the above @xmath172 operators . at @xmath42",
    "this is not an issue , because @xmath186 .",
    "however , that will not be true anymore for the quasi - particles at @xmath44 .",
    "the first step in identifying whether the stationary state of a stochastic process might have a mpa structure , is to insert eq.([mpa - eq ] ) into the master equation .",
    "if lucky , the condition of stationarity can be expressed as simple algebraic conditions on the @xmath187 transfer matrices .",
    "the mpa structure of our process has been studied extensively recently @xcite . from those studies",
    "we know that the three @xmath187 must obey the quadratic algebra : @xmath188 with @xmath72 and @xmath189 arbitrary yet unspecified parameters .",
    "these conditions apply to the entire phase diagram , for all @xmath31 .",

    "the rank is finite only along special lines in the phase diagram .",
    "fortunately , for our purposes we do not need closure ; the quadratic algebra structure itself is sufficient to prove perfect screening .",

    "such a random walker is localized .",
    "the latter can be presented also as localization of a single quantum mechanical particle hopping on a semi - infinite chain with a @xmath68-function attractive potential at the first site , @xmath208 with @xmath209 .",
    "this simple hamiltonian has one single bound state and a continuum spectrum of extended states .",
    "the calculation of the eigen - spectrum is elementary and straight forward .",
    "the eigenstates , @xmath210 , satisfy the equations : @xmath211 bound states have the generic form @xmath212 substitution in eq.([r = p-2 ] ) yields only one bound state , with energy @xmath213 , such that @xmath214 and normalization @xmath215 @xmath216 is equal to @xmath217 .",

    "the @xmath201 component is easily evaluated : @xmath227      perfect screening implies that @xmath228 i.e. , that the sum over @xmath63 of the correlator eq.([correl ] ) , @xmath229 is equal to the right hand side of eq.([perfect - screening - r = p ] ) , @xmath230 with @xmath231 , using that the bound state is also an eigenstate of @xmath232 , @xmath233 . in our specific case the density is simply equal to @xmath234 , but we like to keep the derivation as generic as possible .    we need to demonstrate that this sum rule is valid in the thermodynamic limit , and track carefully any terms that scale as system size @xmath3 .",
    "for example , as discussed already in detail above , the sum rule is trivially true for periodic boundary conditions , but then does not imply perfect screening , because any unscreened surplus can be spread out over the entire lattice in the form of a @xmath131 background density .",

    "instead , we determined the dynamic scaling from the two - point correlation functions",
    ". this might be the first time that it is done in this manner .",

    "the poles of the contour integral links this to the bound states and the quasi - particle mixing .",
    "the formulation of a general proof is important because , if topological , the prefect screening and ( kpz)@xmath12 scaling at large length scales will be generic features , valid to many more processes with clustering .",
