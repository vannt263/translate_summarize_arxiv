    "indeed , it is possible to see some asymmetry of this feature in the raw spectra .",
    "for example , spectrum e has a rather prominent shoulder centered at @xmath82  ev .",
    "overall , with the aid of the cfm model , we associate the 1.44  ev feature with a combination of @xmath84 and @xmath85 transitions ( the @xmath86 transition is substantially weaker for most excitation energies ) .",

    "summarizing the experimental results , we find that the electronic structure of _ m_@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( _ m _  =  ni , co ) differs from the predictions of the lsda primarily in the location of the ( ni , co ) @xmath6 states , which are placed too close to @xmath4 . rigidly moving apart the occupied and unoccupied @xmath3 bands by 1",

    "the v and o states , on the other hand , are relatively insensitive to the choice of _ m _ and agree reasonably well with experiment . however , there is some evidence of a v @xmath7 transition at 1.5  ev in nvo , which is not observed in cvo , and which may indicate some weak occupation of the v @xmath6 states in nvo .",
    "additional circumstantial evidence for this picture comes from the ( ni , co ) @xmath52 rixs measurements .",
    "charge transfer excitations between occupied o @xmath5 states and unoccupied ( ni , co ) @xmath3 states are observed centered at 6.6  ev and 6.5  ev for nvo and cvo , respectively .",
    "these are very similar in magnitude to the v @xmath30 ct excitations identified in v @xmath52 rixs ( 6.6  ev and 6.7  ev ) , suggesting the unoccupied ( ni , co ) @xmath3 states and v @xmath30 states lie close in energy , as indicated by their centers of mass . in both cases , it is the bonding o @xmath5 peak ( lower peak in the xes spectrum ) that is @xmath93  ev below",
    ". additionally , we note that v @xmath29 ct excitations are observed @xmath32  ev above the @xmath30 ct excitations ( and in agreement with the xas data ) , supporting our assignment .",
    "finally , a third ct excitation is evident in the v @xmath52 rixs at 4.3  ev ( 3.6  ev ) , and is interpreted as from the weakly - bonded o @xmath5 states into empty v @xmath30 states , in agreement with optical measurements of ct features .",
    "@xcite    at the ( ni , co ) @xmath16-edges , rixs measurements reveal @xmath7 transitions in good agreement with crystal - field multiplet calculations with a crystal - field splitting of @xmath94  ev , and are strongly reminiscent of the corresponding binary oxides , nio and coo .",
    "the experimental features in nvo are associated with crystal - field transitions to the @xmath84/@xmath85 ( 1.44  ev ) , @xmath85/@xmath87 ( 3.1  ev ) and @xmath88/@xmath86 ( 4.1  ev ) symmetry states respectively .",
    "for cvo , the experimental @xmath7 transitions are assigned to the @xmath73 ( 0.9  ev ) , @xmath71/@xmath74 ( 2.1  ev ) , @xmath77 ( 3.4  ev ) and @xmath78 ( 4.6  ev ) excited states .    as mentioned above ,",
    "there are two distinct ( ni , co ) sites within the unit cell , referred to as cross - tie ( ni1,co1 ) and spine ( ni2,co2 ) .",
    "it has been suggested from optical measurements that the crystal - field environment may be quite different between the two sites , even in the paramagnetic phase at room temperature , leading to optical @xmath7 transitions separated by 0.6  ev ( 0.75 and 1.35  ev ) and 0.9  ev ( 0.7 and 1.6  ev ) for nvo and cvo respectively , with the separation being more severe for the co compound .",
    "@xcite in our band structure calculations , we do not find strong differences in the crystal - field splitting between spine and cross - tie sites . indeed ,",
    "the center of mass of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 states at the two different sites agree to within 0.04  ev for both compounds ( i.e.  more than an order of magnitude smaller than suggested by optical measurements ) .",
    "although the accuracy of the lsda must be questioned for these compounds , this optical splitting is also not observed in our experimental rixs spectra , which are found to agree very well with atomic multiplet theory of a single value of the crystal - field splitting .",
    "whilst we can not exclude such splittings of @xmath95  ev , splittings @xmath96  ev ought to be directly visible in our spectra .",
    "for both compounds , the lowest optical transitions ( @xmath97  ev ) are close to those identified above via rixs .",
    "however , for cvo the second optical feature ( at 1.6  ev ) lies in a dip in our rixs spectra .",
    "rixs is a direct probe of on - site electronic transitions , whereas their detection in optical measurements relies on hybridization with neighboring ligands .",
    "the absence of the optical features in rixs measurements may indicate that their origin is more complex , possibly involving dimer excitations .",
    "dimer excitations , involving two neighboring co sites and of the form @xmath98 , are allowed in optical measurements , but are usually expected to be weaker than single - site excitations in rixs .",
    "their energy can be approximately estimated through the relation , @xmath99 which , for reasonable values of @xmath100 and @xmath101 , would make them relevant at 1    2  ev , approximately the right energy regime .",
    "in summary , we have measured the electronic structure of the local moment insulators _ m_@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 ( _ m _",
    "=  ni , co ) using soft x - ray absorption , emission and resonant inelastic scattering . whereas the v and o states are in reasonable agreement with _",
    "ab initio _ flapw band structure calculations , the lsda fails to account well for the ni and co sites .",
    "the location of the narrow ni and co @xmath6 bands is predicted to lie close to ( and , in the case of co , cross ) @xmath4 , which is not experimentally observed . on the other hand ,",
    "features in the o @xmath14-edge xes and xas indicate the energetic location of these bands , which appear deeper into the occupied o @xmath5 and unoccupied v @xmath6 manifolds than theoretically expected . by shifting apart the occupied and unoccupied states",
    ", we estimate the centers of mass of the ( ni , co ) @xmath3 states .",
    "the weak occupation of the v @xmath30 states in nvo , absent for cvo , may hint towards the different effects of electron localization in the two materials . in that respect , and considering the unsatisfactory agreement between both lda and lda+u and experiment reported elsewhere both above and below @xmath102 , @xcite _ m_@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 would likely benefit from more thorough treatment of electron correlations , such as that afforded by dmft ( although it is acknowledged that such a treatment for these materials is not trivial ) . on the other hand",
    ", we find good agreement between ( ni , co ) @xmath16 rixs and crystal - field multiplet theory , suggesting the crystal field is not as strongly distorted between the cross - tie and spine sites as has been previously suggested .",
    "together , these measurements put strong constraints on the nature of any theoretical treatment of _ m_@xmath0v@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
