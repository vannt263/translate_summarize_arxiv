    "the energy levels of finite nuclei are reasonable in both of the treatments . in the linear definition ,",
    "the spin - orbit splitting is smaller than that in the square root case .",
    "this is caused by the different effective nucleon mass at saturation density .",

    "the predictions of these two treatments are quite different .",

    "the physical quantities , such as effective baryon mass and energy per baryon change discontinuously at the critical density . in the linear case",
    ", no such transition occurs .",
    "the effective baryon masses decrease slowly at high density .",
    "the different behavior at high density will result in significant difference for high density physics .",
