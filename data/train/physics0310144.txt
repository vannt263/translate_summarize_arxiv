    "finally , the _ second _ closed shell icosahedron is formed for @xmath119 which is more stable than the closed cuboctahedral structure by an energy difference 6.27 ev .",
    "this can be explained in terms of their surface energy .",
    "the surface energy of the icosahedral structure is lower than that of the cuboctahedral structure , because the atoms on the surface of the icosahedron are five - coordinate compared to the four - coordinate atoms on the surface of the cuboctahedron . in our calculation , exception to the icosahedral growth is found at around @xmath120 .",

    "this results are in agreement with the experimental study of winter and co - workers @xcite , where they found a bare copper cluster mass spectrum recorded with arf laser ionization shows a sudden decrease in the ion signal at @xmath123 , and from this observation they argued that a change in geometrical structure might occur there , though they have not concluded about the nature of this geometrical change .",
    "they also found a dramatic decrease in water binding energy for @xmath124 and @xmath125 , and concluded that this may represent a return to the icosahedral structure as the closed shell at @xmath119 is approached .",
    "dagostino @xcite confirms our prediction , who performed molecular dynamics using a tight - binding many - body potential and found that icosahedral structures are prevalent for clusters containing less than about 1500 atoms .",
    "valkealahti and manninen @xcite , using effective medium theory , also found icosahedral structures are energetically more favourable than the cuboctahedral structures for sizes up to @xmath126 is consistent with our result : fig.[fig : compare ] shows cuboctahedral structures are least stable among the three structures , icosahedron , decahedron and cuboctahedron .",
    "by contrast , christensen and jacobsen @xcite predicted more fcc - like structures in the size range @xmath127 , in their monte carlo simulation using an effective medium potential .",

    "they also found exceptions to the icosahedral growth at around @xmath120 , where the structures adopt decahedron like geometries ( exact numbers are not available in the ref.@xcite ) .",
    "but the present study disagree with the genetic algorithm study in two points .",
    "firstly , for @xmath128 atom cluster , they found a more disordered structure , while the present study predict it to be an icosahedron based structure which can be derived by removing one surface atom from the 26-atom polyicosahedron .",
    "finally , they found an fcc - like truncated octahedral structure for @xmath129 . instead , the present study predict the icosahedron based structure to be the ground state , where this structure is energetically more favourable than the truncated octahedral structure by an energy @xmath130 ev / atom .",
    "although the genetic algorithm search for global minima is more efficient technique than molecular dynamics , use of the empirical atomistic potential is the main reason @xcite for this kind of disagreement between darby _",
    "et al . _ and the present study .",
    "the computed size dependence of the binding energy per atom for @xmath0 clusters with @xmath131 is depicted in fig.[fig : bi_st ] ( upper panel ) . among all the isomeric geometries examined for a certain cluster size @xmath132 ,",
    "the highest cohesive energy has been considered for the fig.[fig : bi_st ] .",
    "the overall shape of the curve matches the anticipated trend : binding energy grows monotonically with increasing the cluster size .",
    "inset of the fig.[fig : bi_st ] ( upper panel ) shows the comparison of our calculated binding energy with the _ ab initio _ @xcite and experimental @xcite results .",
    "experimentally the binding energies of the neutral clusters were derived from the dissociation energy data of anionic clusters from the tcid experiment @xcite and using electron affinities from the pes experiment @xcite .",
    "the inset figure shows that our calculated binding energies are in good agreement with those from df - lda @xcite and our previous fp - lmto @xcite calculations .",
    "however , our binding energies are systematically overestimated , by an energy @xmath133 to @xmath134 , than the experimental binding energies",
    ". the lda based _ ab initio _ calculations always over - estimate binding energies .",
    "this is a characteristic of the lda . in the present study",
    ", tb parameters have been fitted to the _ ab initio _ lda calculations for very small calculations @xcite .",
    "it is not surprising therefore that the binding energies are over - estimated .",
    "in fact , the present results agree well with other lda based calculations @xcite , all of which overestimate the binding energy .    in the fig.[fig :",
    "compare ] , we compared binding energy per atom for cuboctahedral , decahedral and icosahedral structures for the clusters containing @xmath135 atoms .",
    "fig.[fig : compare ] shows most the clusters in this size range have icosahedral structures .",
    "however , a local structural change occured for @xmath121 , where the structures adopt decahedral structure rather than icosahedral one .",
    "return to the icosahedral growth pattern is found at @xmath5 and continues up to 55-atom cluster .",
    "from the fig.[fig : compare ] it is clear that among cuboctahedral , decahedral and icosahedral structures , cuboctahedral structures are least stable than the other two",
    ".    the second difference in the binding energy may be calculated as @xmath136 where @xmath137 represents the total energy for an @xmath132-atom cluster .",
    "@xmath138 represents the relative stability of an @xmath132-atom cluster with respect to its neighbors and can be directly compared to the experimental relative abundance : the peaks in @xmath138 coincide with the discontinuities in the mass spectra .",
    "these are plotted in the lower panel of fig.[fig : bi_st ] .",
    "we found three major characteristics in the fig.[fig : bi_st ] ( lower panel ) .",
    "firstly , even - odd ( even @xmath139 odd ) oscillation is found .",
    "this can be explained in terms of electron pairing in homos . even (",
    "odd ) clusters have an even ( odd ) number of electrons and the homo is doubly ( singly ) occupied .",
    "the electron in a doubly occupied homo will feel a stronger effective core potential because the electron screening is weaker for the electrons in the same orbital than for inner shell electrons .",
    "thus the binding energy of the valence electron with an even cluster is larger than of an odd one .",
    "this even - odd alternation is prominent up to @xmath140 .",
    "secondly , due to electronic shell or subshell closing , we found particular high peak for @xmath141 and @xmath10 .",
    "unfortunately , the present study does not show any evidence of shell closing for @xmath142 in @xmath143 .",
    "finally , the even - odd alternation is reversed for @xmath144 with maxima at @xmath103 , @xmath105 and @xmath109 , which manifests the geometrical effect and therefore there is no peak at @xmath145 due to electronic subshell closing .",
    "simultaneous appearance of these three features in @xmath143 demonstrates the interplay between electronic and geometrical structure , which is in agreement with the experimental study of winter _",
    "they found both jellium - like electronic behaviour and icosahedral structure in copper clusters . in an experimental study of mass spectra of ionized copper clusters @xcite , substantial discontinuities in mass spectra at @xmath146 for cationic and @xmath147 for anionic clusters as well as dramatic even - odd alternation",
    "are found . from the sudden loss in the even - odd alternation at @xmath148 in the krcl spectrum , winter _",
    "argued about the possible geometrical change there .",
    "therefore , we conclude in the section that sudden loss in the @xmath149 vs @xmath132 plot ( lower panel of fig.[fig : bi_st ] ) is due the structural change in that regime .",
    "such kind of electronic effects can not be reproduced by empirical atomistic potentials .",
    "@xcite , using the gupta potential , found significant peaks at @xmath35 7 , 13 , 19 , 23 and 55 due to icosahedral ( or polyicosahedral ) geometries . in the present study , we have found a peak at @xmath150 , but not at the other sizes found by them .",
    "however , the stable structures predicted by us are the same : the lowest energy structure of @xmath100 is a pentagonal bipyramid ( @xmath101 symmetry ) ; for @xmath150 and @xmath151 , the structure are the _ first _ and _ second _ closed icosahedral geometries respectively .",
    "polyicosahedral structures are found for @xmath152 ( double icosahedron ) and @xmath153 ( triple icosahedron ) atom clusters .",
    "as the reason , the present study shows significant high peaks at @xmath154 , @xmath113 and @xmath155 due to electronic shell closing effect and average peaks at @xmath156 and @xmath157 due to electron pairing effect . at these sizes , the electronic effects dominates over the geometrical effects and consequently the above peaks can not observed by darby .",
    "besides the second difference of the cluster binding energy , a sensitive quantity to probe the stability is the highest occupied - lowest unoccupied molecular level ( homo - lumo ) gap energy . in the case of magic clusters",
    "shell or subshell closer manifests themselves in particularly large homo - lumo gap , which was previously demonstrated experimentally @xcite .",
    "calculated homo - lumo gap energies are plotted in the fig.[fig : homo - lumo ] , where we observed even - odd alternation due to electron pairing effect and particularly large gap for @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath158 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 due to electronic shell and subshell closing . however , sudden loss of even - odd alternation is found around @xmath11 due to the change in the geometrical structure in that region .",
    "_ @xcite also found a sudden loss in even - odd alternation in the krcl spectrum at @xmath148 and concluded this may coincide with any possible change in the geometrical structure there .",
    "in fact , katakuse _",
    "_ @xcite observed identical behaviour in the mass spectra of sputtered copped and silver cluster ions : a dramatic loss of even - odd alternation at @xmath159 , signifying a sudden change to a geometrical structure in which stability , and abundance , is less sensitive to electron pairing . therefore , the sudden loss in the fig.[fig : homo - lumo ] again confirms the structural change there .",
    "so , the present study correctly predicts the `` magic numbers '' in this regime correctly and confirms the experimental prediction : a geometrical change ( icosahedron @xmath160 decahedron ) is occurring around @xmath11 .      within the present tb scheme",
    ", we can get a ` qualitative ' description of the ionization potentials with cluster size according to koopmans theorem .",
    "this limitation arises mainly from the choice of the slater - koster ( sk ) tb parameters and the extent of their transferability @xcite , which may be improved by the proposed scaling scheme of cohen , mehl and papaconstantopoulos @xcite .",
    "however , our aim is to get only a qualitative description of ionization potential with cluster size .",
    "calculated ionization potentials are plotted in the fig.[fig : ip ] .",
    "in fact , we observed same pattern as it was in homo - lumo gap energy _ vs _ cluster size : peaks at @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath158 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and even - odd alternation due to the same reasons discussed in the sec .",

    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) due to electronic shell and subshell closing are correctly reproduced in the studied regime .",
    "second difference of binding energy , homo - lumo gap energy and ionization potential show even - odd oscillatory behaviour because of electron pairing in homos in agreement with experiment .",

    "this is in agreement with the experimental studies @xcite .",
    "we conclude this is due to the geometrical change ( icosahedron @xmath160 decahedron ) around there .",
