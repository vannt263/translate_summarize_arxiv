    "the presence of an additional body will cause the motion of the eclipsing binary with respect to the centre of mass of the entire system and result in advances / delays in the times of eclipses due to the light time effect .",

    "the model of an eclipsing binary is from @xcite .",
    "it describes systems that do not fill their roche lobes .",
    "we decided to examine detached binaries as such systems are the most likely ones to serve as stable clocks .",
    "the adopted model is simple enough to provide fast computations and at the same time enables an adequate description of an eclipsing binary .",
    "eclipses are described as an obscuration of two discs .",
    "the algorithm used to compute a synthetic light curve comes from @xcite and is based on a few simple equations .",
    "let us note that two of the equations are misprinted in @xcite .",

    "the remaining symbols are as in the original article .            in the above description",
    ", the local perspective effect is ignored . in a typical realistic case",
    "the separation between the stars is very small compared to the distance between the observer and binary .",
    "the parameters describing the system are the separation @xmath5 , radius of the first and second star @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the total luminosity @xmath9 , the fraction of light emitted by second component @xmath10 , the keplerian elements of the planetary and binary orbits ( ellipticity , inclination , semi major axis ) .",
    "both orbits , of the planet and the binary star are keplerian .",
    "we assume that the perturbing planet changes only the position of the binary stars centre of mass and none of the orbital elements . in our simulations",
    "we assume circular orbits .",
    "in general we add three types of noise to the synthetic light curves .",
    "the first one is the photon noise depending on the brightness of an observed eclipsing binary , the second one is the white noise of different origin than the photon noise and the third one is the red noise due to e.g. the earth s atmosphere , the instrumentation .",
    "the first two are typical for the space based photometry and all three are expected to be present in the ground based data .",
    "the red noise is applied using the package for the exact numerical simulation of power - law noises plnoise @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the impact of the red noise on the planet discovery space differs with the typical time scale associated with the red noise . in our code",
    "the red noise is parameterized via the minimal decay rate of the oscillators generating the noise . even if the standard deviation remains the same , the eclipses timing precision changes with the typical time scale of the red noise .",
    "the examples of red noise with different time scales are shown in figure [ fig:03_rednoise1 ] .",
    "of 0.01 , 0.001 and 0.0001 .",
    "red noise used in our simulations of ground observations is characterized by @xmath11  0.01 . ]",
    "we simulate a light curve of an eclipsing binary with the photon noise dependent on the brightness of a target and additional gaussian and red noises if necessary .",
    "the level of the last two is based on the instrument s characteristic and the place of the observations ( space / ground ) .",
    "for such a light curve , a planetary light time disturbance affecting the times of photometric measurements is also added according to the assumed orbital parameters of a circumbinary planet .",
    "the criterion for a detection or a non detection of a planet is as follows @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the measured time of the @xmath15-th eclipse ( the @xmath16 moment of one complete light curve ) , @xmath17 denotes its standard deviation and @xmath18 the corresponding weight of such a timing measurement .",
    "finally @xmath19 is calculated to estimate the magnitude of the timing signal which is present in data and this is compared to the largest error of @xmath20 .",
    "such a procedure allows us to get a quick insight whether a planetary timing signature may be present in the data set .",
    "if the inequality [ eq06:detcrit2 ] is satisfied it means that a planet is detected and this is denoted with red colour . otherwise , a non detection is denoted with blue colour .",
    "the resulting discovery space is a result of an averaging over a rectangle of 121 neighbouring points .",
    "pure red colour denotes a certain detection ( fraction 121/121 ) and pure blue colour a certain non - detection .",
    "intermediate colours are computed as a linear interpolation between the two basic colours according to a given fraction of detections in a rectangle ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "note that such a definition of the detection means that a planetary signal is detected when its timing amplitude @xmath21 is equal to or larger than @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the precision ( formal error ) of the timing accuracy .",
    "hence , the main factor that defines the discovery space is the precision with which one can measure the moment of one eclipse .",
    "obviously , the longer the data set of timing measurements , the higher is the confidence level with which a planetary signal is detected ( for details see * ? ? ?",
    "for example , since kepler will provide @xmath2410 times longer data sets than corot , the confidence level of its putative detection would be higher . or in other words , for the same confidence level kepler would allow for a detection of smaller amplitudes than corot .",
    "we have decided to use our simpler , more conservative approach which is not affected by a particular choice of sampling of the timing measurements .    in the above ,",
    "the time of an eclipse is computed in two ways .",
    "the first and classic approach is to use @xmath14 as one of the parameters of a multiparameter least - squares fit of a physical model to the synthetic light curve . in this approach",
    "the parameters of the binary assumed to calculate the light curve are disturbed and used as the starting values of the least - squares parameters .",
    "parameters which are varied and then fitted for include the radii @xmath3 , @xmath4 , the inclination @xmath25 , @xmath16 the orbital reference epoch , the orbital period of the binary @xmath26 and the luminosity of the secondary @xmath27 .",
    "we use minpack library @xcite to carry out a least - squares fitting .",
    "the simulations can be easily extended to e.g. cases with the elliptically distorted stars and include the limb darkening as e.g. in @xcite .",
    "as we have tested , in such a case the results are slightly different after introducing these two effects and the total time required to compute a discovery space is a few times longer .",
    "the resulting area of the discovery space corresponding to detectable planets is a bit smaller and moves toward upper - right corner ( see e.g. figure [ fig : corkep ] ) .",
    "this is in our opinion the result of the correlations between the increasing number of parameters used in the least - squares fit which often accounts for very subtle effects .",
    "for this reason , we believe that it is best to use an approach known from e.g. radio pulsar timing and precision radial velocities relying on a reference template pulse or spectrum to measure a timing or rv shift .",
    "in such an approach the time of an eclipse is computed by comparing a given light curve with a reference light curve obtained by folding all the simulated photometric measurements with the orbital period of a binary . as mentioned , this is an approach used in radio pulsar timing or in precision radial velocity technique where the cross correlation function and the reference radio pulse or template spectrum are used to compute a timing shift or a doppler shift . in our case , in order to compute @xmath14 and its formal error @xmath17 we use the least - squares formalism .",
    "let us note that for the simpler light curve model with the spherical binary components and no limb darkening , both approaches result in the same discovery space and for the more complicated binary model case , the approach employing a reference light curve results in a better discovery space ( a wider range of detectable planets ) .",
    "obviously the second approach will work well only if the light curve is sufficiently stable but then only for such stable light curves / binaries one may hope to detect planets .",
    "the parameters of the binary star , the instruments and the simulated photometric measurements are summarized in tables [ tab:10_starpar ] , [ tab:09_siminput ] and [ tab:11_simpar ] . the discovery space is computed on a dense grid of planetary periods and masses . for the figures ,",
    "the discovery space is represented by averaging 121 neighbour points from the grid .",
    "the red colour in the diagrams denotes certain detection ( fraction 121/121 ) and the blue one the lack of detection ( 0/121 ) .",
    "all the intermediate colours are computed as a linear interpolation .",
    "black lines in the discovery space show the planet s mass and period which generates a given timing amplitude , @xmath21 .",
    "the equation describing such a line is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the mass and period of a planet , @xmath31 is the mass of the binary star , @xmath32 stands for the speed of light and @xmath33 is the gravitational constant .",
    ".binary s star characteristic [ cols= \" > , < \" , ]     figure [ fig : corkep ] shows a few examples of a typical discovery space for the corot and kepler missions . each discovery space is a result of one simulation run covering 40401 points ( 201 by 201 ) for which the inequality eq .",
    "[ eq06:detcrit2 ] was checked .",
    "based on a discovery space and equation [ eq.mp ] , we derive a timing amplitude which fits best to the border between a detection and non detection . as can be seen e.g. in figure [ fig : corkep](a - b ) @xmath21 is an approximation of the actual border and hence the best fit value of @xmath21 is also characterized by its non zero error @xmath34 depending on how the real border deviates from @xmath21 .",
    "the ongoing space missions corot and kepler aimed to detect transiting planets can in principle be used also to detect circumbinary planets via et .",
    "these missions have the obvious advantage over any ground effort of providing an uninterrupted set of photometric measurements of a respectively 150 day and four year time span .",
    "in our simulations we used the parameters of the missions as described by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for corot and by @xcite for kepler .",
    "they are also summarized in table [ tab:09_siminput ] .",
    "the examples of discovery space for corot and kepler are shown in figure [ fig : corkep ] .",
    "while both instruments are capable of providing very precise photometry , the resulting discovery space is also affected by the cadence of photometric measurements and the brightness of the targets .",
    "overall the potential of detecting circumbinary planets with corot and kepler comes out somewhat less attractive than one may have hoped for .",
    "the simulations allow us to determine the following relations for corot @xmath35 , and for kepler @xmath36 , @xmath23 is the photometric precision of a single measurement in mmag and @xmath21 the detectable timing amplitude ( dta ) is given in seconds ( see figure [ fig:01_sigmavsa ] ) .    320 and kepler @xmath24900 secodns ) . ]",
    "the potential problem with both missions is the predefined target pool .",
    "if this is taken into account , despite high photometric precision the chances of detecting a circumbinary , non - transiting planet may be somewhat small .",
    "for example for the kepler mission an upper limit to detectable circumbinary planets may be estimated as follows @xmath37 where :    * @xmath38 is the number of targets , @xmath39 ( kepler.nasa.gov ) , * @xmath40 is the eclipsing detached binary stars ratio to all stars , @xmath41 @xcite , * @xmath42 is the percentage of stars having giant planets ( assuming that it is the same as for single stars ) , @xmath43    and this does not take into account the probability of detecting a planet with a given mass and period via et .",
    "clearly , in order to detect circumbinary planets using et one may have to turn to the ground based observations where the target pool can be carefully selected and fine - tuned to provide for the highest possible chances of detecting circumbinary planets . however , let us note that in the above we used a percentage of _ detached _ binaries in the asas catalogue .",
    "if one is willing to try the presumably less stable contact binaries as well , then @xmath40 increases to @xmath44 according to the results from the asas sample @xcite .",
    "even more optimistic preliminary results come from the kepler and corot fields for which the percentage of eclipsing binaries is @xmath45 ( h. deeg , l. doyle personal communication ) .",
    "in such a case , the number of potentially detectable planets would rise to @xmath46 .",
    "[ fig : corkep2 ]",
    "performing numerical simulations that would aim to answer all or almost all questions related to a search for circumbinary planets using ground based et is not practical .",
    "possible observing scenarios are highly dependent on a choice of a target , its parameters and the coordinates of an observatory .",
    "such simulations can be carried out if the target pool and the observatory are already chosen .",
    "for these reasons , we present below a few typical problems one may encounter when performing a ground based et survey and analyze them through numerical simulations .",
    "these results are an essence of a much larger set of simulations we carried out .",

    ", we assumed a radius ratio of 0.5 while keeping @xmath47 . to the simulated photometric measurements we added red noise with an rms of 0.35 mmag , white noise with an rms of 0.35 mmag and photon noise depended on the actual momentary brightness .",
    "we divided the light curves into 9 parts to explore which parts when present have the largest impact on the detectable timing amplitude ( see figures [ fig:14_template1 ] and [ fig:14_template2 ] ) . in the simulations we removed parts of the light curves and used such incomplete light curves to measure the times of eclipse .",
    "all the possible permutations without repetition were used for sets ranging from 1 to 9 light curve s elements . afterwards an average dta was calculated . whenever a dta could not be computed , the result by default was set to 20 sec .",

    "are quite faint and the duration of an observing window is only 150 days which effectively limits the detection capabilities to brown dwarfs . in the case of kepler , the target pool puts an upper limit of potentially detectable circumbinary gas giants at about 40 in the best case scenario .",

    "such survey would have to employ several 0.5-m class telescopes to be efficient . as the survey would typically focus on the shorter period detached eclipsing binary stars ( see figure  10 ) , it would target a different set of targets than a radial velocity based survey .    in figure [ fig:13_limits ]",
    "we compare planet detection capabilities of the radial velocity , astrometry and eclipse timing .",
