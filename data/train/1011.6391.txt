    "the rescaling method , however , has not been checked for other modes , and is likely to be less reliable for the @xmath77 contributions , where the aleph distribution was not measured , but estimated using monte carlo , and has a purely phase space shape .",

    "differ by significantly more than the @xmath82 total theoretical error estimate mentioned above .",
    "the observed @xmath10-instability of the fb @xmath49 fesr results could arise from deficiencies in any of the contributions appearing in eq .",
    "( [ tauvussolution ] ) .",
    "problems with the @xmath46 spectral integrals seem unlikely , but can be tested for using fesrs for the @xmath80 v+a channel alone . a problem with missing higher multiplicity @xmath80 spectral strength",
    "could also be exposed by such an analysis , assuming the ope representation used to be reliable .",
    "specifically , for @xmath10 large enough to include some portion of the region of missing strength , @xmath1 would be too low , while for @xmath10 below the region of the missing strength , @xmath1 should rise back to its true value .",
    "the @xmath80 v+a fesrs are considered in the next section .",
    "the most obvious candidate for a source of @xmath10-instability in the ope contribution is the potentially slowly converging integrated @xmath2 series . for @xmath48 ,",
    "the @xmath49-weighted integrated @xmath2 series behaves as @xmath83 for the cipt+adler function case , @xmath84 for the cipt+correlator case , and @xmath85 for the fopt case , where the terms in parentheses are the estimated 5-loop , @xmath86 contributions .",
    "for the two cipt cases , though there is cancellation on the contour at intermediate orders , this cancellation does not persist to higher orders , and the integrated series appears rather badly behaved . the behavior is better for the fopt case , which was also found to yield improved @xmath10-stability .",
    "worth noting is the fact that @xmath54 for the better behaved fopt prescription is a factor of @xmath87 larger than that for either of the two cipt prescriptions .",
    "the @xmath88 increase between cipt and fopt increases @xmath1 by @xmath89 establishing the insufficiently conservative nature of the @xmath82 estimate for the combined theoretical error . with the difference between the fopt result and the average of the two cipt results as a new truncation uncertainty estimate",
    ", this source dominates the theoretical error .",
    "taking the fopt result ( favored by the @xmath10-stability criterion ) as the new central value , the result for the fb @xmath49 determination becomes @xmath90 @xmath91 below 3-family unitarity expectations .",
    "fb @xmath0-based fesrs can also be constructed using other @xmath11 . for the cipt prescription , if the @xmath10-instability of the @xmath49 fesr results from premature truncation of the @xmath2 series , convergence can be improved by choosing weights which emphasize contributions from the region of the complex @xmath92 plane away from the spacelike point , where @xmath93 is smaller and the convergence , at the correlator level , of the @xmath2 series better .",

    "the @xmath49 results for both the fopt and cipt+correlator prescriptions are shown for comparison . improved @xmath10-stability compared to the @xmath49 cipt results is observed - stability .",
    "the reason is that , having been constructed to improve the convergence of the integrated cipt series , there is no reason to expect the new weights to also improve the convergence of the integrated fopt series , and indeed they do not .",
