    "the spin@xmath1orbit interaction is a relativistic interaction connecting the spin and orbital motion of charged elementary particles .",
    "this interaction plays essential roles in conversion between electric signals and magnetic ones @xcite .",
    "of particular interest is the rashba spin@xmath1orbit interaction@xmath1the one that arises when the inversion symmetry of the system is broken @xcite .",
    "it is represented by the quantum mechanical hamiltonian @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the electron mass , @xmath4 is the planck constant divided by @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a vector representing the direction and strength of the rashba field and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the momentum operators for the electron and vector of pauli matrices , respectively .",
    "the interaction leads to various cross - correlation effects in electromagnetism , i.e. a mixing of electric and magnetic fields .",
    "a straightforward consequence of the rashba interaction in the dc limit is the spin polarization of a conduction electron induced when an electric current is applied ( called the rashba@xmath1edelstein effect ) @xcite , and the electric current generated when a magnetic field is applied ( the inverse edelstein effect ) @xcite .",
    "the rashba - induced spin polarization has been predicted to be highly useful for magnetization switching by electric current @xcite .",
    "magnetoelectric effects have been intensively studied in insulating materials ( multiferroics ) , where magnetization and electric polarization are mutually coupled @xcite .",
    "a conducting rashba system is unique in this sense , since magnetoelectric effects couple magnetization and electric current instead of electric polarization ; thus , the effect is expected to be smoothly integrated into conventional electronic devices .",
    "although the rashba interaction realized in two - dimensional electron gases in semiconductors has generally been weak , a strong rashba interaction of @xmath9 ev  was recently observed at surfaces of noble metals doped with bi @xcite .",
    "metallic surfaces and interfaces have now become highly important in spintronics for magnetization control and spin - to - charge conversion with high efficiency @xcite .",
    "it has been observed that topological insulators , the extreme cases of rashba systems where the quadratic term in the dispersion disappears , have intriguing features such as a coupled collective mode of spin and charge ( spin plasmon ) on the surface @xcite .",
    "bulk bitei , a semiconductor where carrier electrons are introduced by bi vacancies @xcite , was recently observed to have a large rashba splitting of @xmath10 ev@xcite ; a large magneto - optical ( kerr ) effect @xcite and a giant spin - polarized photocurrent @xcite were also discovered .",
    "the coupling of electric and magnetic degrees of freedom by the rashba spin@xmath1orbit interaction leads to intriguing optical responses , including anisotropic propagation ( directional dichroism ) and electromagnetic metamaterial behavior ; metamaterials are materials that exhibit extraordinary electromagnetic characteristics such as negative refraction @xcite .",
    "negative refraction was originally discussed by veselago and was considered to occur if the electric permittivity and magnetic permeability were simultaneously negative @xcite .",
    "it has in fact been achieved by designing resonators for electric and magnetic responses with the same resonant frequencies in ghz @xcite and thz @xcite ranges . for shorter wavelengths , small structures comparable to the wavelength are necessary , and thus , artificial structures would not be suitable . instead , natural materials become promising , since their structures can be designed down to the atomic size . in fact , oxide superconductors with layered structures , such as la@xmath11sr@xmath12cuo@xmath13 and bi@xmath14sr@xmath14cacu@xmath14o@xmath15 , behave as metallic materials in the direction parallel to the layers and as dielectric materials in the direction perpendicular to the layers in the infrared frequency range @xcite . such materials with strong anisotropic electric properties ( called hyperbolic materials )",
    "exhibit negative refraction when an interface parallel to the metallic plane is subjected to an electromagnetic wave .",
    "these materials are also useful for filters and for enabling hyperlenses to go beyond the diffraction limit @xcite .",
    "tetradymites , such as bi@xmath14te@xmath16 and bi@xmath14se@xmath16 , have been observed to be a new class of natural materials exhibiting a a hyperbolic nature for visible light @xcite .    in this paper , we present a quantitative and consistent theoretical analysis of the optical properties of a bulk rashba conductor by evaluating the correlation functions from a microscopic standpoint .",
    "first , we shall demonstrate that bulk rashba systems such as bitei indeed exhibit naturally significant hyperbolic metamaterial properties in the infrared regime because of spin@xmath1charge mixing .",
    "these unique behaviors of rashba systems are not observed in topological insulators , for which the bare plasma frequency is not defined by the quadratic dispersion .",
    "second , we demonstrate that in the presence of magnetization or a magnetic field , the system exhibits directional dichroism because of breaking of both spatial inversion and time reversal symmetries .",
    "the effect is strongly enhanced by a singularity at the interband transition edges , the stronger of which is predicted to occur in the infrared and visible light regime for bitei .",
    "our analysis establishes a bridge from the theoretical side between the optical properties discussed mostly on phenomenological grounds and solid - state transport phenomena based on the microscopic quantum mechanical viewpoint .",
    "the qualitative equivalence of the dc transport and optical responses is noted experimentally as well as from the symmetry viewpoints @xcite .",
    "the equivalence is natural from our analysis , since both phenomena are governed by a same conductivity tensor evaluated at different frequencies .",
    "when an electric field is applied , the rashba interaction generates electron spin polarization ( the so - called edelstein effect ) @xcite ( fig . 1 a ) whose density reads @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a unit vector along the rashba field and @xmath19 is a coefficient .",
    "the induced magnetization is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the gyromagnetic ratio .",
    "the interaction also induces the inverse effect , where an electric current density is induced by an applied magnetic field @xmath22 , namely @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a coefficient",
    ".    these cross - correlation effects also affect the optical properties .",
    "the inverse edelstein current ( [ jie ] ) is written by using faraday s law as ( in the momentum and angular frequency representation ) @xmath25 $ ] .",
    "the edelstein effect ( [ se ] ) also leads to a magnetization current density , @xmath26 .",
    "the coefficients of the edelstein effect and its inverse effect are related as @xmath27 since both the spin density ( [ se ] ) and current density ( [ jie ] ) are written in terms of the uniform component of the spin@xmath1current correlation function @xmath28 ( the superscripts @xmath29 denote the direction ) .",
    "we thus see that the sum of the two generated currents is @xmath30   $ ] and that the conductivity tensor has off - diagonal elements linear in @xmath31 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements result in a rotation of the incident electric field around a rotation axis @xmath32 by an angle proportional to @xmath33 .",
    "the dispersion reads @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the magnetic permeability ) for a circular polarization @xmath36 , and hence , the light velocity depends on both the incident direction ( sign of @xmath37 ) and the circular polarization ( directional circular dichroism ) .",
    "this result is natural from a symmetry viewpoint , since breaking of inversion symmetry alone leads to the so - called natural optical activity , which affects only circularly polarized light @xcite .",
    "peculiar behaviors of unpolarized light arise if the diagonal components of the conductivity tensor are modified by the rashba interaction that occurs when the direct and inverse edelstein effects are combined .",
    "in fact , the magnetization @xmath38 induced by the edelstein effect generates an electric current due to the inverse edelstein effect : @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "the resultant polarization @xmath40 is opposite to the applied electric field when @xmath41 ; in other words , the mixing of spin and charge excitations reduces the plasma frequency ( fig .",
    "1 a ) . microscopically , this softening effect is represented in the conductivity tensor in the long - wavelength ( @xmath42 ) limit : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a function representing the magnitudes of the rashba@xmath1edelstein and inverse edelstein effects ( plotted in fig .",
    "1 b ) . here , @xmath45 is the electron spin polarization ( @xmath46 denotes spin ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49^{-1}$ ] is the fermi distribution function , ( @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the boltzmann constant and temperature , respectively ) , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the fermi energy and fermi wave vector , respectively ) and @xmath55 is a damping parameter .    in terms of @xmath56 ,",
    "the rashba@xmath1edelstein coefficient is @xmath57 ( @xmath58 denotes the imaginary part ) .",
    "the function @xmath59 is finite for a broad frequency range lower than the higher interband transition edge @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are the transition edges , with @xmath62 being a dimensionless rashba strength parameter and @xmath63 ( see supplementary information ) . for bitei , @xmath64 ,",
    "the plasma frequency @xmath65 , and @xmath66 are in the infrared regime , whereas @xmath60 is in the visible frequency .",
    "choosing @xmath6 along the @xmath67-axis , the dielectric tensor @xmath68 reads @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the bare plasma frequency ( @xmath71 is the electron density ) .",
    "as observed in equation ( [ e - perp ] ) , the plasma frequency in the @xmath72 plane is indeed reduced by the rashba interaction to @xmath73 .",
    "the frequency range between the bare plasma frequency @xmath65 and the reduced plasma frequency @xmath74 is of particular interest , since the system is insulating in the direction of the rashba field but metallic in the perpendicular direction ( fig .",
    "2 a , b ) .",
    "materials with such anisotropy are called hyperbolic because of their hyperbolic dispersion @xcite .",
    "in fact , choosing the wavevector @xmath31 in the @xmath75 plane , the dispersion relation is @xmath76 for @xmath77 ( @xmath78 denotes the @xmath79-component of the electric field ) and @xmath80 for @xmath81 and @xmath82 . when both @xmath83 and @xmath84 are positive , the dispersion is elliptic ; however , it is hyperbolic if one of these values is negative ( fig",
    ". 2 c , d ) . note that in equation ( [ disp1 ] ) the component @xmath85 is governed by @xmath86 with positive real part , whereas @xmath87 is by @xmath88 with negative real part ; thus , the wave propagation in the @xmath89-direction is insulating ( metallic ) .",
    "hyperbolic materials exhibit the following peculiar optical properties .",
    "when the interface is parallel to the metallic plane , the incident light tends to be refracted in the negative direction , since the metallic nature reflects the light ( fig .",
    "this behavior is observed in the dispersion curve ( fig .",
    "2 c ) , which reveals that the @xmath90-component of the group velocity is negative .",
    "the poynting vector @xmath91 also has a negative @xmath90-component .",
    "notably , negatively refracted light is focused along the insulating direction , as observed in the plot of the transmittance defined by the ratio of the flow of @xmath91 as @xmath92 ( @xmath93 is the incident poynting vector ) ( fig .",
    "2 e , g ) .",
    "in fact , the angle of refraction , determined by @xmath94 , does not exceed a threshold value @xmath95 and the absolute value of the threshold angle is small , since no solution exists for small @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "2 c ) . for @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( fig",
    ". 2 g ) , the incident light even for a large angle of incidence is concentrated in a direction within @xmath99 from the direction perpendicular to the interface .",
    "this focusing effect is stronger for smaller frequencies close to @xmath74 , whereas the distribution is broader for larger frequencies ( fig . 2 c , g , i ) .",
    "in contrast , when the interface is perpendicular to the metallic plane ( fig . 2 b ) , the light is mostly reflected when the angle of incidence is small ( fig . 2 f ) , since no solution exists for small @xmath100 ( fig .",
    "2 d ) . for transmitted light , in contrast to the parallel case , the angle of refraction can not be small , and thus , the refracted waves propagate close to the interface ( fig",
    ". 2 h , j ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the refracted wave is the backward wave , where the wave vector @xmath31 and the poynting vector @xmath91 are in opposite directions when the propagation is perpendicular to the interface ( fig .",
    "2 b , d)@xcite .    for bitei , the maximum plasma frequency known so far is @xmath101 hz ( corresponding to a wavelength of @xmath102 m ) for @xmath103 m@xmath104 and @xmath105 ev @xcite . using @xmath10 evand @xmath106 @xmath107 , we have @xmath108 , and thus , @xmath109 for frequencies @xmath110 ( fig .",
    "1 b ) , resulting in @xmath111 ( @xmath112 hz , corresponding to the wavelength of @xmath113 m ) .",
    "thus , hyperbolic behavior arises in the infrared regime .    for experimental realization , the penetration depth @xmath114 of the system , defined by @xmath115}$ ] , is also essential .",
    "the imaginary part of the relative permittivity is on the order of @xmath116 in the hyperbolic regime , and the imaginary part of @xmath117 calculated from equation ( [ disp1 ] ) is @xmath118\\simeq \\frac{\\omega}{c}{{\\rm im}}[{\\varepsilon}]$ ] . for @xmath119",
    ", we have @xmath120 m , and the absorption of the light is neglected if the sample thickness is smaller .",
    "so far , we have considered a pure rashba conductor where time reversal symmetry is maintained .",
    "we now discuss the case without time reversal symmetry , as realized in a thin film of a rashba conductor attached to a ferromagnet with uniform magnetization or in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "we thus consider the @xmath121 exchange interaction @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a dimensionless magnetization vector and @xmath124 represents the strength of the exchange interaction .",

    "the first term of equation ( [ sigmamq ] ) is proportional to @xmath128 and corresponds to the anomalous hall effect induced by the magnetization parallel to the rashba field , which leads to an enormous magneto - optical response ( kerr effect ) @xcite .",
    "other terms having diagonal components linear in the wave vector @xmath31 induce directional dichroism when @xmath129 is finite .",
    "we consider the case where the interface is in the @xmath72 plane with the magnetization along the @xmath130-axis and the light incident to the @xmath75 plane .",
    "for the electric field in the @xmath130-direction , the dispersion relation including the effect of magnetization ( equation ( [ sigmamq ] ) ) leads to @xmath131 when @xmath132 , where @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 ( @xmath136 ) is a moment that governs the dichroism . in the broad frequency range below @xmath60",
    ", @xmath137 is on the order of unity , whereas it has singularities at the transition edges ( @xmath138 ) ( fig .",
    "more precisely , the dominant contribution to the function @xmath139 behaves as @xmath140 , and , since @xmath141 ( @xmath142 is a step function ) close to the edge at @xmath143 , @xmath137 diverges at the transition edges if @xmath144 as @xmath145 .",
    "considering a finite damping , the directional dichroism is strongly enhanced by a factor of @xmath146 at the transition edges .",
    "let us define the non - reciprocity ratio as the ratio of the transmission rate for the angle @xmath147 and @xmath148 as @xmath149 .",
    "for the system with thickness @xmath150 , @xmath151 , where @xmath152 .",
    "for @xmath153 and @xmath154 m , @xmath155 in the infrared regime with @xmath156 for @xmath157 , which is already large enough for experimental detection . at the edge @xmath143 , @xmath158",
    "is strongly enhanced to be approximately 0.24 if @xmath159 .    mathematically , the edge singularity results from the dichroism arising from the correlation function linear in @xmath160 , which is obtained by expansion with respect to the angular frequency .",
    "an additional condition for imposing finite @xmath161 was necessary for the singularity in the rashba case.the singularity does not exist in the coefficient @xmath162 , and only a cusp structure exists at @xmath66 ( fig .",
    "3 b ) ( the singularity  in ref .",
    "@xcite is a cusp . ) . in the presence of of many interband transitions , the singularity is still expected to be present , since each transition contributes independently to the singularity .",
    "we have demonstrated that the non - reciprocal optical property is determined by the mutual orientation of @xmath31 and a vector @xmath161 .",
    "this vector is known as the rashba - induced effective vector potential that drives electron spin flow @xcite , and in this context , the directional dichroism in the magnetic rashba system is a result of the doppler shift of the light due to the flow induced by the vector potential @xcite .",
    "the factor @xmath163 essential for directional dichroism is consistent with the observation of dc transport @xcite , where the electric resistance in the presence of applied electric and magnetic fields ( @xmath164 and @xmath22 ) was observed to be anisotropic depending on @xmath165 ( @xmath31 is the wave vector of electron ) , as observed by the replacement @xmath166 and @xmath167 .",
    "the effective vector potential @xmath161 is also interpreted as a toroidal moment ( a vector that couples with the rotation of magnetic field ) and has been discussed intensively in multiferroics @xcite .",
    "in fact , the isotropic contributions of our dichroism result ( [ sigmamq ] ) is described by an effective hamiltonian @xmath168 where @xmath169 and @xmath170 are coefficients and @xmath171 ( see supplementary information ) .",
    "the interaction ( [ hd ] ) is the interaction hamiltonian proposed to describe cross correlation effects in insulator multiferroics , and the vector @xmath161 and @xmath172 in this context are toroidal and quadrupole moments , respectively @xcite .",
    "the form of interaction between the toroidal moment and the electromagnetic fields in equation ( [ hd ] ) suggests that the edge singularity is a common feature of toroidal moment - induced directional dichroism .",
    "in fact , the energies of lights having positive and negative @xmath163 get shifted according to the interaction ; this energy difference results in directional dichroism if the interband transition matrix element depends on the energy .",
    "as a result , the dichroism occurs proportional to the energy derivative of the interband matrix element , and the edge singularity arises whenever the matrix element vanishes at the edge @xmath173 faster than linear , i.e. proportional to @xmath174 with @xmath175 . in the real - space representation ,",
    "the isotropic part of the current responsible for the dichroism ( contribution of equation ( [ sigmamq ] ) ) is @xmath176 , where @xmath177 and @xmath178 are the effective magnetization and electric polarization induced in metals by the toroidal and quadrupole moments , respectively .",
    "these expressions are the metallic analogues of those in multiferroics , and our study indicates that the cross - correlation physics discussed so far for insulators is universal and can be applied to metals without changing their mathematical structure .",
