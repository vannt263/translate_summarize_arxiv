    "the auxiliary field diffusion monte carlo ( afdmc ) @xcite results of ref .",
    "@xcite do not lead to a decrease of the binding energy predicted by fermi - hyper - netted - chain ( fhnc ) and brueckner - hartree - fock ( bhf ) calculations @xcite .",
    "this suggested that the overstimation of the snm binding energy resulting from fhnc calculation with uix three body potential @xcite , may not be solved with a better choice of the variational wave function .",
    "more sofisticated three body potentials , while providing a quantitative account of the energies of the ground and low - lying excited states of nuclei with @xmath1 @xcite , give very different results in pure neutron matter ( pnm ) @xcite .",
    "lagaris and pandharipande @xcite and friedman and pandharipande @xcite constructed an effective , density - dependent , two - nucleon potential ( tni ) to take into account three- and many - nucleon forces .",
    "however , they adopted a purely phenomenological procedure , as the parameters of the density dependent functions appearing in this potential were determined through a fit of the saturation density , the binding energy per nucleon and the compressibility of symmetric nuclear matter ( snm ) . in general , fitting the potential to results obtained with many - body techniques makes the potential itself affected by the approximations of the many body calculations .",
    "our potential @xcite improves the tni model since it has been derived from a realistic microscopic three - nucleon force , the uix potential , which provides a good description of the properties of light nuclei , although very recently it has been shown @xcite that uix does not reproduce both the @xmath2 scattering lenght and the vector polarization observables @xmath3 and @xmath4 . however , our method can be applied to more refined three nucleon interactions , like the chiral nnlol described in @xcite .    to obtain the density dependent potential ,",
    "the average on the degrees of freedom of the third particle has been carried out using a formalism suitable to account for the full complexity of nuclear dynamics .",
    "our results show that , in doing such reduction , of great importance is the proper inclusion of both dynamical and statistical nn correlations , whose effects on many nuclear observables have been found to be large @xcite .",
    "we have used cbf and the fantoni - rosati ( fr ) cluster expansion formalism@xcite to perform the calculation of the linear - in - density terms of the effective potential , arising from the irreducible three - nucleon interactions modeled by the uix potential .",
    "the effective potential has been implemented in the afdmc computational scheme to obtain the eos of snm , while similar calculations using the uix potential are not yet possible , due to the complexities arising from the commutator term .",
    "in addition , the density - dependent potential can be used to include the effects of three - nucleon interactions in the calculation of the nucleon - nucleon scattering cross section in the nuclear medium .",
    "the knowledge of this quantity is required to obtain a number of nuclear matter properties of astrophysical interest , ranging from the transport coefficients to the neutrino emission rates @xcite .",
    "the argonne @xmath5 @xcite two - body potential model is given by @xmath6 where @xmath7 in the above equation , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are pauli matrices acting on the spin or isospin of the @xmath12-th particle , while @xmath13 is the tensor operator , @xmath14 is the relative angular momentum and @xmath15 is the total spin of the pair .",
    "we used the so called argonne @xmath16 and argonne @xmath17 potentials , which are not simple truncations of the argonne @xmath18 potential @xcite , but rather reprojections @xcite obtained by refitting the scattering data and the deuteron binding energies . in all light nuclei and nuclear matter calculations",
    "the results obtained with the @xmath16 are very close to those obtained with the full @xmath18 .",
    "using a nuclear hamiltonian including only two - nucleon interactions leads to the underbinding of light nuclei and overestimating the equilibrium density of nuclear matter .",
    "hence , the contribution of three - nucleon interactions must be taken into account , by adding to the hamiltonian the corresponding potential .",
    "one of the most widely used is urbana ix ( uix ) @xcite potential , consisting of two terms : the fujita and miyazawa @xcite attractive two - pion exchange interaction @xmath19 and the purely phenomenological repulsive term @xmath20 @xmath21[\\tau_{ij},\\tau_{jk}]\\big)\\nonumber \\\\ v^r&=u_0\\sum_{cyclic}t^2(m_\\pi r_{ij})t^2(m_\\pi r_{jk})\\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the spin structure of @xmath19 is given by @xmath22 the radial functions read @xmath23 where @xmath24 are short - range cutoff functions .",
    "the parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 are varied to fit the observed binding energies of @xmath27h and @xmath28he and to reproduce the empirical nuclear matter saturation density , while the cutoff parameter is kept fixed at @xmath29 @xmath30 .",
    "in the correlated basis theories of fermi liquids @xcite , the expectation value of the two - body potential can be written in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the operatorial components of the two  body distribution function .",
    "the uncorrelated wavefunction @xmath33 in nuclear matter is conveniently chosen to be a slater determinant of plane waves .",
    "the structure of the correlation operator @xmath34 reflects the complexity of the argonne @xmath17 nucleon - nucleon potential @xcite : @xmath35    the radial functions @xmath36 , appearing in the definition of the correlation operator are determined by the minimization of the energy expectation value @xmath37 , which provides an upper bound to the true ground state energy @xmath38 . as explained in detail in @xcite , the calculation of @xmath39 in cbf theories is carried out by i ) expanding @xmath40 in powers of dynamical correlations @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 that vanish in uncorrelated matter and ii ) summing up the main series of the resulting cluster terms by solving a set of coupled integral equations . to accomplish the first of these two steps , an extension of the fr cluster expansion @xcite , that is able to treat scalar correlations only ,",
    "was introduced in @xcite to deal with spin  isospin dependent correlation operators , like those of eq .",
    "( [ eq : foperator ] ) .",
    "the cluster terms are most conveniently represented by diagrams @xcite .",
    "consisting of dots ( vertices ) connected by different kinds of correlation lines .",
    "in particular @xmath44 is usually represented by a dashed line , @xmath45 by a single wavy line , and @xmath46 by a doubly wavy line .",
    "in addition to the dynamical correlation lines , there are also statistical correlation lines , represented by solid oriented lines forming closed loops that never touch each other .",
    "they arise from the slater determinant and are associated with the slater function @xmath47 @xmath48\\ , .\\ ] ] open dots of the diagrams represent the active ( or interacting ) particles ( 1 and 2 ) , while black dots are associated with passive particles , i.e. those in the medium .",
    "integration over the coordinates of the passive particles leads to the appearance of a factor @xmath49 .",
    "it can be shown that all the diagrams contributing to @xmath39 , hence to @xmath50 , are linked .",
    "those built with scalar passive bonds only , with the only exception of the so called _ elementary _ diagrams , can be summed up in closed form by solving the fhnc equations @xcite .    on the other hand , diagrams having one or more passive operatorial bonds are calculated at leading order only .",
    "this implies that at most two operatorial passive bonds can be attached to any internal point , thus only diagrams with single operator chain ( soc ) are considered .",
    "such an approximation is justified by the observation that operatorial correlations are much weaker than the scalar ones .",

    "the diagram in the right - hand side represents the density - dependent two - body potential , dressed with the two - body distribution function . obviously , @xmath58 has to include not only the three - body potential , but also the effects of correlation and exchange lines .    , discussed in the text .",

    "in particular @xmath63 , obtained by averaging over the third particle without statistical and dynamical correlations is far from the solid curve of uix .",
    "when only statistical correlations are considered , the relative potential , @xmath64 , comes closer to the uix curve . only when the full set of diagrams of fig .",

    "a proper treatment of the statistical correlation is crucial for the construction of a density dependent potential to be treated as an additive term to the standard two - body potential .",
    "some care is needed for the density dependent potential to reproduce the exchange loop involving particles @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath0 with the appropriate symmetry factor ( see @xcite for a thorough discussion ) .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the correlation functions are determined by minimizing the two - body cluster term of the energy expectation value for a set of parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",

    "have been investigated in @xcite by comparing the twist averaged boundary conditions ( tabc ) with the periodic box condition ( pbc ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of 66 fermions approaches the thermodynamic limit very well , so that the energies of 66 neutrons computed using either tabc or pbc turn out to be almost the same .",
    "we can infer that the finite - size errors in the present afdmc calculations for pnm do not exceed 2% of the asymptotic value of the energy .",

    "it is remarkable that the values obtained with density dependent potential are very close to those resulting from the genuine uix three body potential . while the saturation density is well reproduced , this being not surprising since the constant @xmath26 of the uix potential has been fitted to this value , the values of the compressibility are slightly lower than the experimental ones .",
