    "thurston s dehn surgery theorem is one of the brightest gems in the crown of modern geometric 3-manifold topology .",
    "it runs as follows :    let @xmath3 be a link such that @xmath4 has a hyperbolic structure .",
    "there is a finite set @xmath5 of filling slopes of components of @xmath6 such that all dehn fillings of @xmath7 without a slope from @xmath5 are hyperbolic .",
    "following the natural order of mathematics , one wishes to quantify this existence result into something more palpable .",
    "one way to make this result more concrete is to provide some measure of length for dehn filling slopes , then to say that all slopes of large length ( for a suitable definition of `` large '' ) yield hyperbolic dehn fillings .",
    "such theorems include the asymptotics of @xcite , the thurston - gromov @xmath8-theorem proved in @xcite , and the 6-theorem of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "now , the @xmath8- and 6-theorems just use the nave notion of length of a slope , viz .",
    "length of a geodesic representative in an embedded horospherical torus . in @xcite",
    "however , hodgson and kerckhoff defined _ _ normalized length _ _",
    "@xmath9 , which for a single slope @xmath10 on a horospherical cusp torus @xmath11 is just @xmath12 for a more general dehn filling @xmath10 , letting @xmath13 be the slope along which @xmath10 fills @xmath11 , hodgson and kerckhoff define @xmath14 by requiring @xmath15 and @xmath16 using this definition of length , they proved the following theorem :    [ thm : mot ] let @xmath17 be a compact orientable 3-manifold whose interior admits a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume .",
    "let @xmath10 be a dehn filling of @xmath17 such that @xmath18 .",
    "then    * @xmath19 ( the filled manifold ) itself admits a complete hyperbolic metric on its interior ; *",
    "@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a simple closed geodesic of @xmath19 of length at most @xmath22 and admitting an embedded tube of radius at least @xmath23 ; and * @xmath24 .",
    "after suitably rephrasing this , it seems to give a practical method for determining dehn filling heritage :    let @xmath1 , @xmath25 be orientable 3-manifolds admitting complete hyperbolic metrics of finite volume on their interior .",
    "@xmath25 is a dehn filling of @xmath1 if and only if . ]",
    "either    * @xmath25 is a dehn filling of @xmath1 along a slope of normalized length less than or equal to 7.5832 , or * @xmath1 is isometric to @xmath26 for a simple closed geodesic of length less than 0.156012 .",
    "the collection of slopes of @xmath27 with normalized length less than 7.5832 is computable , and likewise the length spectrum of @xmath25 is computable , and snappy can drill out curves and determine isometries ,",
    "so that is that . right ?",
    "unfortunately not .",
    "the problem is in drilling out curves .",
    "snappy can only drill out simple closed curves in the dual 1-complex of an ideal triangulation .",
    "as explained in @xcite on page 264 , these may or may not be isotopic ( or even homotopic ) to a given geodesic which one wishes to drill out .",
    "fortunately , theorem [ thm : mot ] is a corollary of a much more powerful theorem , theorem [ thm : main ] , about how much dehn filling decreases volume .",
    "theorem [ thm : mot ] follows from the upper bounds in theorem [ thm : main ] , but theorem [ thm : main ] contains lower bounds as well .",
    "the calculations below lead to the following theorem :    [ thm : rewrite ] let @xmath0 be orientable 3-manifolds admitting complete hyperbolic metrics of finite volume on their interiors .",
    "let @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath25 is a dehn filling of @xmath1 if and only if either    * @xmath25 is a dehn filling of @xmath1 along a slope of normalized length less than or equal to @xmath29 , or * * @xmath25 has a closed simple geodesic of length less than @xmath30 , and * * @xmath25 is a dehn filling of @xmath1 along a slope of normalized length @xmath9 such that @xmath31    this puts dehn filling heritage for hyperbolic manifolds in terms of procedures either already made rigorous or with a reasonable hope of being made rigorous soon , viz .",
    "estimates on volume , length spectra , cusp area , slope length , and ( to a lesser extent ) isometry testing .",

    "the reader should note that the above theorem has @xmath41 in place of @xmath42 .",
    "this is valid  see , e.g. , corollary 5.13 of @xcite .",
    "this gives complicated bounds on @xmath43 and @xmath34 in terms of @xmath39 and @xmath44 .",
    "we require simple but not necessarily tight upper and lower bounds on @xmath34 and @xmath14 in terms of @xmath43 . in a dehn parental test",
    ", the bounds on @xmath34 will be used most often ; the upper bounds on @xmath14 will be used when the volumes of the putative parent and child @xmath45 and @xmath46 are close , _ and _ @xmath46 has a very short geodesic .",
    "for instance , @xmath45 might be the whitehead link complement , and @xmath46 might be a high - order dehn filling on the @xmath47 pretzel link complement .    to get these bounds , we will approximate solutions to inequalities ( [ eqn : lobd ] ) and ( [ eqn : upbd ] ) in @xmath44 and @xmath39 , respectively , for given @xmath43 .",

    "next , we should do the same to the inequalities ( [ eqn : lenbds ] ) , getting bounds for @xmath44 and @xmath39 in terms of @xmath34 . to do that we need @xmath65 s monotonicity .",
    "we can then play the various inequalities off one another to get our desired result .",
    "also , we should determine the monotonicities of @xmath66 and @xmath67 ; they will prove useful later .",

    "@xmath73      plainly we already have an upper bound on @xmath34 , viz .",
    "we just need to put the right - hand side in terms of @xmath43 .",
    "in fact , since @xmath65 is increasing , @xmath75 is decreasing .",
    "therefore we just need a lower bound on @xmath39 ; applying @xmath75 to this lower bound will give us a bound on @xmath34 .    at this point , one could use the standing assumption in @xcite after p. 1079 that all variables named @xmath76 represent @xmath77 for some @xmath78 .",
    "therefore , @xmath79 . as a matter of fact , this is where the bounds in theorem [ thm : mot ] come from .",
    "but we would like a better bound for small @xmath43 .",
    "now , @xmath80 unfortunately @xmath51 is decreasing , so this does nt give a lower bound on @xmath39 .",
    "also , @xmath39 is defined by @xmath81 , but all we know about @xmath14 is @xmath18 .",
    "in fact , this bound is taken from the standing assumption on @xmath76 .    however , we also know @xmath82 @xmath66 and @xmath67 both are decreasing . therefore ,",
    "if we can get a lower bound on @xmath44 , we get a lower bound on @xmath39 , via upper bounds on @xmath82 .    finally , ( [ eqn : lobd ] ) from theorem [ thm : main ] says @xmath83 , and @xmath50 is decreasing on @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath84 , so this yields a lower bound on @xmath44 , and hence an upper bound on @xmath34 , in terms of @xmath43 ; to wit , @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 for @xmath88 , and @xmath89 , @xmath90 .    this bound is valid only when @xmath43 is in the domain of @xmath91 .",
    "if this is not the case , then the right - hand side should be replaced by hodgson and kerckhoff s original bound 0.156012 .",
    "we know @xmath92 .",
    "we just got upper bounds on this , yielding a lower bound for @xmath14 .",
    "more explicitly , @xmath93 to get an upper bound on @xmath14 , we can get a lower bound on @xmath94 , which would result from an upper bound on @xmath39 ( since @xmath66 is decreasing ) , which would result from a lower bound on @xmath95 ( since @xmath51 is decreasing ) .",
    "but @xmath96 by assumption .",
    "so @xmath97 where @xmath98 satisfies @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",
    "since these bounds depend upon inverting functions defined by integrals , one can not expect a computer to calculate the bounds very quickly .",
    "but if we approximate the functions and relax the bounds , we can get decent running times .    the conditions which the approximations should satisfy ( in order to accord with ( [ eqn : lbd ] ) , ( [ eqn : lblc ] ) , and ( [ eqn : ublc ] ) ) are not difficult to derive .",
    "for instance , an approximation @xmath101 to @xmath75 should be decreasing , since @xmath102 is itself decreasing and we want a reasonable approximation ; and @xmath101 should be greater than @xmath102 so that we can deduce @xmath103 from ( [ eqn : lbd ] ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath104 suffices .",
    "useful approximations for all the necessary functions are as follows :    [ lem : bounds ] @xmath105 where @xmath106    @xmath107    assume @xmath108 .",

    "but the initial statement is just equation ( [ eqn : lobd ] ) .    for variety ,",
