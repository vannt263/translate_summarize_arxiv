    "at the leps experiments , which started from 1999 , the ultraviolet ( uv ) laser light with the wavelength of 355  nm has been injected into the 8  gev electron storage ring in order to produce the laser compton backscattering ( lcs ) photon beam @xcite .",
    "the beam intensity has exceeded @xmath1 hz in the tagged photon energy range of 1.52.4  gev .",
    "high polarization is transferred from the laser light to the photon beam , so that the t - channel exchange reaction with a forward meson photoproduction is usable as a parity filter .",
    "such reactions have been extensively investigated by the leps forward spectrometer , which covers the polar angle region within @xmath220@xmath3 and @xmath210@xmath3 in the horizontal and vertical directions , respectively .",
    "for example , we have analyzed the forward k@xmath4",
    "@xmath5 k@xmath6@xmath7 production from a proton target with the identification of the associated @xmath8 in the missing mass distribution @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the lcs photon beam energy was upgraded up to 2.9  gev by using a deep uv laser .",
    "the dominance of natural parity exchange in the t - channel was observed based on the parity spin asymmetry measurement , indicating the evidence of the controversial scalar meson @xmath9(800 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the further systematic studies of hadron photoproduction generally require larger acceptance coverage and higher photon beam intensity .",
    "recently , we measured the differential cross sections of backward @xmath0 photoproduction with the forward proton detection at the leps forward spectrometer @xcite .",
    "it was suggested that the bump structure at w@xmath102.3  gev may be enhanced in the most backward angles , which are not covered by the clas experiments @xcite .",
    "there may be a resonance contribution with a high angular momentum , but it is needed to increase the statistics possibly with a wide angular acceptance . because of the demands represented by this measurement , we are motivated to start the leps2 project at another beamline of spring-8 @xcite .",
    "the leps2 beamline utilizes a 30  m - long straight section , the number of which is limited to only 4 of the 62 beamlines at spring-8 .",
    "the horizontal divergence of the electron beam at this straight section is reduced to 14  @xmath11rad in @xmath12 , while the usual 7.8  m - long straight section including the leps beamline provides the divergence of 58  @xmath11rad . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : leps2bl](a ) , the lcs photon beam spread at the leps2 beamline is determined not largely by the electron beam divergence but mostly by the compton scattering angle , which is calculated by the kinematics depending on the photon energy .",
    "this achieves a well collimated photon beam with the radius below 10  mm even at the 135  m downstream from the compton scattering point , enabling us to construct a large experimental site outside the storage ring building .",
    "we also aim to increase the tagged photon beam intensity nearly up to 10@xmath13 hz for the photon energy range below 2.4  gev by using the uv lasers with the wavelength of 355  nm . we plan the simultaneous injection of four lasers , whose output power have increased from 8  w to 16  w or 24  w. the multiple laser operation has become possible thanks to the reduced electric power consumption of those new lasers . for the simultaneous injection ,",
    "we have installed new beamline chambers with large apertures @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : leps2bl](b ) , the laser injection from the side concrete shield wall into the spring-8 ring tunnel is adopted in order to reduce the total length and apertures of the newly installed chambers .",
    "the radiation level at the laser injection room is also lowered with the minimized shield materials , so that we can easily access the laser optics for adjustments .",
    "the large mirror to guide the four laser beams from the side direction toward the straight section inside a vacuum chamber has been modified to possess a horizontal slit and a small center hole for avoiding the heat input from x - rays and the e@xmath6e@xmath14 conversions of the lcs photon beam , respectively .",
    "in addition to the lcs beam with the uv lasers , we plan to improve the intensity of a high energy photon beam using the deep uv lasers with the wavelength of 266  nm . we expect the tagged photon intensity approaching to 10@xmath15 hz with the techniques similar to the uv case .        the construction of the leps2 beamline was approved in 2010 . the leps2 experimental site",
    ", whose size is 12  m @xmath16 18 m in area with the height of 10  m , was built in 2011 .",
    "the constructed experimental building has the volume 15 times larger than the experimental hutch of the leps experiments . in 2011",
    ", we also transported the bnl - e949 magnet , which is a 1  tesla solenoidal magnet with the weight of 400 tons , and successfully installed it into the leps2 experimental building .",
    "this magnet has the bore diameter of 2.96  m and the inner length of 2.22  m , where the charged particle spectrometer described later will be placed .",
    "the beamline vacuum chambers and the laser injection system were finally installed and aligned in late 2012 .",
    "after adjusting the electron beam orbit at the straight section and degassing the absorbers and the mask with synchrotron radiation , the first lcs photon beam at the leps2 beamline was produced with the injection of a single uv laser beam during the machine study on 27  jan .",
    "the simultaneous injection of three uv laser beams was then tested on 2  apr .  for the further investigation of beam properties as described below .",
    "figure  [ fig : bmprop](a ) shows the photon energy spectra , which have been measured by a large bi@xmath17ge@xmath18o@xmath19 ( bgo ) crystal with the diameter of 8  cm and the length of 30  cm .",
    "the blue histogram represents the spectrum for a bremsstrahlung photon beam without laser injection at the electron beam current of 10  ma , while the black histogram shows that for a lcs photon beam with the contamination of a bremsstrahlung beam at the current of 0.1  ma .",
    "the two spectra are normalized by the electron beam current , the data taking time , and the daq live time . the lowest photon energy part of the lcs beam spectrum is cut off at @xmath100.65  gev because of a @xmath207  mm lead collimator inside the storage ring tunnel .",
    "the intensity of a lcs photon beam , corresponding to the spectrum height , is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of a bremsstrahlung beam , although the straight section is long .",
    "the photon beam profile was measured by the 16  ch .",
    "@xmath16 16  ch .",
    "two - dimensional array of 3  mm - square scintillating fibers with a 0.5  mm - thick aluminum converter , which was placed between the plastic scintillators for the charge veto and the trigger .",
    "we refer to this detector as a beam profile monitor ( bpm ) .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bmprop](b ) , the profile of a bremsstrahlung photon beam is a bit spread with the rms radius of @xmath109  mm because of the electron beam orbit structure at the 30  m - long straight section . on the other hand , the profile with laser injection is well collimated with the dominance of a lcs photon beam ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bmprop](c ) ) , resulting in the rms radius of @xmath106  mm as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : leps2bl](a ) .",
    "the photon beam intensity was measured with the simultaneous three laser injection .",
    "the intensity is usually measured by counting the recoil electron rate at the tagger , but its optimization is still underway .",
    "therefore , we adopted the following two alternative methods for the intensity measurement : one of them is the estimation from the change of electron beam life before and after the laser injection .",
    "the electron beam life corresponding to the compton scattering loss was measured to be @xmath10120 hours .",
    "this measurement was performed with the electron beam current of 100  ma , so the backward compton scattering rate corresponding to the photon beam intensity was calculated to be @xmath107  mhz for 0@xmath21e@xmath22@xmath212.4  gev .",
    "another estimation was done by the measurement of the e@xmath6e@xmath14 conversion rate at the bpm .",
    "the bpm trigger rates were 29.0 khz and 3.7 khz for the cases with laser on and off , respectively . by taking into account the pair production cross sections at the converter and the trigger scintillator , the photon beam transmission through the beamline materials ( @xmath1076% ) , and the cutoff of low energy photons by the collimator",
    ", the intensity of a lcs photon beam is calculated to be @xmath107  mhz , which is consistent with the estimation from the electron beam life .",
    "the obtained beam intensity is nearly half of our expectation , so that we are trying to fix the problems of laser injection optics .",
    "two different detector setups are being prepared for the experimental programs at the leps2 facility .",
    "the first experiments will be carried out with the electromagnetic calorimeter called bgoegg from the latter half of fy2013 .",
    "the calorimeter system has been installed in the upstream part of the leps2 experimental building , and covered by a thermostatic booth to avoid the calorimeter gain change which is expected at the level of @xmath231.5%/@xmath3c . in the center part of the leps2 building",
    ", the bnl - e949 solenoidal magnet has been set up with a pit hole .",
    "we will keep constructing the leps2 charged particle spectrometer inside the solenoid during the bgoegg experiments in parallel .",
    "the experiments with this spectrometer will follow the bgoegg experiments in a few years .",
    "the bgoegg electromagnetic calorimeter is an egg-shaped assembly of 1320 bgo crystals , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgoegg_setup](a ) .",
    "each crystal with the shape of a truncated square pyramid has the longitudinal length of @xmath10220  mm , corresponding to 20 radiation length .",
    "the bgo crystals are separately stacked in the forward 13 layers and the backward 9 layers of the 60 crystal ring without partition supports .",
    "the bgoegg covers the large geometrical acceptance from 24@xmath3 to 144@xmath3 in polar angles .",
    "we will install a cylindrical drift chamber ( cdc ) and plastic scintillators inside the bgoegg for the detection of charged particles .",
    "the bgoegg calorimeter was constructed at research center for electron photon science ( elph ) , tohoku university , and was successfully transported to spring-8 in december 2012 .",
    "the performance of the bgoegg calorimeter has been examined at elph by injecting a positron beam into a 5@xmath165 crystal array with the front coverage by scintillating fiber hodoscopes @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgoegg_perform](a ) , the measured energy resolution varies as a function of the incident energy , resulting in @xmath24e / e@xmath251.3% at 1  gev .",
    "the positron beam position was also measured from the shower distribution in 3@xmath163 crystals , and was compared with the hodoscope information .",
    "the position resolution was estimated to be 3.1  mm at the center part of the crystal array for the incident energy of 1  gev .",
    "( see fig .",

    "photomultipliers , high voltage suppliers , and a related daq system were prepared only for the most forward 5 layers or 300 bgo crystals .",
    "a test beam of the lcs photons was irradiated onto a 20  mm - thick carbon target at the bgoegg center .",
    "shower activities which coincide with the tagger signal timing were clustered after the rough gain calibrations of 300 crystals . in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgoegg_perform](c ) , two of such clusters were combined to calculate the invariant mass with the different conditions of energy thresholds",
    ". a clear peak of the @xmath26 decays is observed with the mass resolution of @xmath1015  mev , which is slightly worse than the expected resolution because the precise energy calibrations has not been done .",
    "the @xmath27 decays require larger opening angles , so the corresponding signal peak is not clear in this plot due to the limited geometrical acceptance .",
    "we are considering to search for the @xmath0-bound nuclei as one of main physics programs at the bgoegg experiments . by the partial restoration of the chiral symmetry",
    ", the @xmath0 mass is theoretically expected to decrease by @xmath10150  mev at a normal nuclear density @xcite .",
    "this produces a potential for the @xmath0 meson to be bound inside a nucleus .",
    "such a state may be accessible by injecting a high energy photon into a nucleus and by striking a proton to the extremely forward direction .    at the bgoegg experiments ,",
    "the forward acceptance hole of the calorimeter is covered by tof detectors to measure the momenta of charged particles , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bgoegg_setup](b ) . for the extremely forward region at @xmath28@xmath218.5@xmath3 , a 2  m@xmath164  m wall of resistive plate chambers ( rpc ) ,",
    "whose individual size is 20  cm@xmath16100  cm , will be placed at the 12  m downstream of the target .",
    "the time resolution of the rpc was measured by a beam test at the leps beamline , and was estimated to be 50 psec @xcite .",
    "we are planning to cover the forward angles between the rpc wall and the calorimeter ( 8.5@xmath3@xmath21@xmath28@xmath2124@xmath3 ) by the tof wall of plastic scintillators at the just upstream of the e949 solenoid .",
    "the positions and angles of forwardly produced charged particles will be measured by a drift chamber ( dc ) , which has an effective diameter of 1280  mm .",
    "the dc consists of 6 planes with three different wire angles , possessing 16  mm - square drift cells .",
    "the position resolution of 130 @xmath11 m has been confirmed at a beam test @xcite .",
    "the setup of the bgoegg calorimeter with the forward charge detection is suitable for the @xmath0-bound nuclei search . in the case",

    "this measurement has become possible by extending the lower limit of the tagged photon energy range to 1.35  gev with the modification of a leps2 beamline chamber and by covering the kinematical region well below the @xmath0 production threshold of e@xmath301.45  gev .",
    "our detector setup has the feasibility for this study because , at low photon energies , a proton is directed to the extremely forward angles and the @xmath0 angle dependence of bgoegg acceptance gets small . at e@xmath22@xmath212.4  gev",

    "highly excited baryon resonances , which are not well explained by the constituent quark model , strongly couple to the final state of multi - mesons and a nucleon .",
