    "apart from the great theoretical interest in the electronic properties of graphene@xcite spurred by the experimental realization of these one atom thick carbon layers,@xcite the new material has been soon recognized as a promising candidate for technological applications.@xcite at low temperatures , electrons in free standing ( that is , suspended above the substrate ) graphene sheets can travel in an essentially ballistic manner , without scattering over distances of the order of a micron.@xcite with the carrier density tuned to finite values by an applied gate voltage , the temperature dependence of the resistivity in suspended graphene sheets shows a metallic behavior : at temperatures above 50k , it increases linearly with temperature .",
    "the carrier mobility at room temperature in suspended graphene is severely limited by scattering by out of plane flexural phonons,@xcite resulting in a resistivity that increases quadratically with the temperature .",
    "the effect of flexural phonons on the charge carrier mobility can be eliminated by applying strain or placing graphene on a substrate.@xcite compared to graphene devices on substrates , suspended graphene samples offer charge carrier mobilities which are higher by a factor of ten , approximately.@xcite likewise , the thermal conductivity of graphene on a substrate can be an order of magnitude lower than that of suspended graphene , due to damping of the flexural phonon modes.@xcite for technological applications , however , the suspended geometry imposes rather strict limitations on the device architecture .",
    "moreover , free floating graphene is always crumpled,@xcite with the corrugations inducing effective fields which in turn influence the charge carriers.@xcite while many experiments so far involved graphene samples deposited over sio@xmath0 or grown over sic substrates , hexagonal boron nitride ( hbn ) has developed into a promising candidate as a substrate material for improved graphene based devices.@xcite hbn is a piezoelectric , large band gap insulator isomorphic to graphite .",
    "boron and nitrogen atoms occupy the inequivalent sublattices in the bernal structure .",
    "the lattice mismatch with graphite is small ( 1.7%),@xcite and hbn is expected to be free of dangling bonds and surface charge traps .",
    "a number of mechanisms limit the low temperature carrier mobility in graphene.@xcite at room temperature , interaction with optical surface phonon modes on the interface between graphene and the sio@xmath0 substrate was found to play an important role.@xcite it is this mechanism of remote - phonon scattering from an hbn substrate that we want to consider in the present work . in general ,",
    "the polar phonon modes on the surface of the substrate ( with energies of @xmath2mev ) create a long - range electric field , which influences the electrons in the graphene sheet , typically around 4  away .",
    "the influence of remote phonon scattering on the carrier mobility in two - dimensional electron systems is a well - known phenomenon in semiconductor physics , and was investigated for quantum wells and other heterostructures including metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors ( mosfets).@xcite the effect is more pronounced in graphene due to the much smaller vertical dimension of the devices , as determined by the van der waals distance .",
    "also , the band gap in semiconductor systems prevents low energy interband transitions , which are present in graphene with the two bands touching at the dirac point or with the metallic band in the case of doping .",
    "for single - layer graphene sheets on substrates of sic or sio@xmath0 , surface - phonon scattering has been investigated in refs .  , employing various methods for calculating the conductivity and describing the screening of the interaction by conduction electrons . in the present paper",
    "we calculate the resistivity due to surface phonon scattering for hbn substrates .",
    "we show below that the temperature dependence of this mechanism scales with the thermal population of surface phonon modes . while for sio@xmath0 substrates , the resistivity due to remote phonon scattering is known to be comparable or might surpass that due to graphene intrinsic phonons,@xcite we show that for hbn , the effect is almost an order of magnitude smaller , resulting in desirable high charge carrier mobilities .",
