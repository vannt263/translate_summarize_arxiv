    "the presence of quenched disorder is known to strongly affect the dynamical and steady state properties of many systems . for instance",
    ", for noninteracting particles moving in a random medium , disorder can lead to anomalous transport and change the manner in which the steady state is approached @xcite .",
    "moreover , when inter - particle interactions are present , disorder can induce new collective effects such as phase separation @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of quenched , sitewise disorder on a simple stochastic model of interacting particles known as the zero range process @xcite .",
    "this process can be viewed as describing a system of interacting particles hopping in and out of wells with various depths . while the static properties of this model are known analytically , the temporal properties are not as well characterized .",
    "here we study the approach to the steady state of a zero range process which undergoes a disorder - induced phase transition .",
    "the study of stochastically evolving lattice models has played a central role in better understanding interacting , statistical systems @xcite .",
    "such models are defined directly through simple stochastic rules , in contrast to the traditional route of defining the interactions through a hamiltonian and then constructing dynamical rules consistent with it .",
    "the zero range process describes one such class of lattice models ; other important classes include the asymmetric simple exclusion process which is a simple model of a current - carrying system @xcite , and the contact process whose steady state shows a phase transition from an active phase to a dead phase where no further evolution is possible @xcite .",
    "the zero range process deals with a conserved number of particles hopping on a lattice with , in general , site - dependent rates . for almost all choices of these rates , the particles have on - site interactions ; however , these rates do not depend on the particle occupation at other sites . in this sense ,",
    "the range of interaction is zero .",
    "the steady state of this process is known to be of product measure form in all dimensions @xcite . in the recent past ,",
    "the zero range process has been used to model several systems with quenched disorder , such as traffic flow in a system of cars with different preferred speeds @xcite and activated flow down a rugged slope @xcite , besides several other applications @xcite .",
    "a recent application is in a model of polymerization in a random medium with imperfect traps @xcite .",
    "interestingly , for several choices of disorder , as the density is increased , the steady state of the system shows a phase transition from a homogeneous phase in which the density is roughly uniform , to an infinite aggregate phase in which the density profile has a singularity at the site with the lowest hopping rate .",
    "the latter state is particularly interesting since in this phase , starting from an initial random distribution of particles , an infinite aggregate is formed at the site with the lowest hopping rate .",
    "the question arises : what is the mechanism by which the system locates the site with _ globally minimum _ rate and transports a finite fraction of the total number of particles to it through the random medium ? in this paper , we address this question for a symmetric zero range process in one dimension .",
    "figure  [ tseries ] shows how the density profile evolves in time starting from an initial random distribution of particles ( fig .",
    "[ tseries]a ) to the steady state in which an aggregate builds up at the site with the lowest hopping rate ( fig .",
    "[ tseries]d ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we define the model and discuss its steady state properties in section  [ model ] . in section  [ hydro ] , we first give a simple , qualitative picture of the dynamics of relaxation to the steady state .",
    "the scaling properties of the relaxation time define a dynamic exponent which is determined using local equilibrium arguments , supported by monte carlo simulations .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of open questions .",
    "in this section , we define the model and briefly discuss its steady state properties .",
    "we consider the unbiased or biased motion of a conserved number @xmath10 of particles on a @xmath11 dimensional lattice of length @xmath5 with periodic boundary conditions . at any site @xmath0 occupied by a nonzero number of particles , a single particle attempts to hop out at a rate @xmath1 , independent of the number of particles present at site @xmath0 or its neighbours .",
    "note that this choice of rates implies an attractive on - site interaction since the hop - out rate of these particles is lower than that of noninteracting particles . the zero range process with this particular choice of rates has appeared in several contexts , as in a particlewise disordered , asymmetric exclusion process @xcite and as a limiting case of a model of aggregation and fragmentation with sitewise disorder @xcite .",
    "as discussed in section  [ intro ] , the problem is essentially to understand how the system locates the site with the minimum hopping rate .",
    "for this reason , it is useful to assign two labels to the hopping rate .",
    "we denote the rates by @xmath12 where @xmath0 is the site index and @xmath13 is the index when the rates are arranged in ascending order with @xmath14 labelling the lowest rate . correspondingly , @xmath15 denotes the mass ( or number of particles ) at the site with hopping rate @xmath12 at a particular instant . in the following",
    ", we will only display the labels which are pertinent to the discussion and suppress the rest .",
    "also , unless the time dependence is explicitly specified , all the quantities will refer to the steady state .",
    "the rates @xmath16 are chosen independently for all @xmath17 from a common probability distribution f(w)= ( w - c)^n , w , c > 0 , n > 0 .",
    "fw for both the symmetric and the totally asymmetric case , the probability @xmath18 of a configuration @xmath19 is known to be given by @xcite p(\\ { m(k ) } ) = _ k=1^l^d ( ) ^m(k ) , soln where @xmath20 is the normalisation constant and @xmath21 is the fugacity which can be determined using the conservation law @xmath22 .",
    "this solution holds in all dimensions and for all bias . in the presence of bias , eq.([soln ] ) describes a nonequilibrium steady state whereas in the absence of bias , it describes an equilibrium state as the condition of detailed balance holds .",
    "this equilibrium state is described by a hamiltonian which is long ranged , thus allowing the system to have a phase transition even in one dimension @xcite .",
    "the probability @xmath23 that there are @xmath24 particles at site @xmath0 is given by p(m , k)= ( 1- ) ( ) ^m , which implies that the average number of particles at site @xmath0 is = = avgm , where @xmath25 is the average occupation probability of site @xmath0 .",
    "since the total number of particles is conserved , = + _ c^1 dw f(w ) cons , where @xmath26 is the total particle density and disorder averaging has been done .",
    "this equation is reminiscent of bose - einstein condensation in the ideal bose gas where the lowest momentum state is macroscopically occupied beyond a critical density @xmath27 @xcite . at @xmath28 ,",
    "the fugacity @xmath21 gets pinned to the lower cutoff of @xmath29 , namely @xmath3 ( to which @xmath30 will tend in the thermodynamic limit ) so that the site with the lowest hopping rate supports an aggregate with a finite fraction of total particles .",
    "the condition @xmath31 determines the critical point @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the integral on the right hand side of eq.([cons ] ) .    for @xmath34 ,",
    "the typical mass at all sites is of order unity . as the density",
    "is increased , there is a phase transition at @xmath28 . in the high density phase ,",
    "the slowest site supports mass of @xmath35 whereas the site with rate @xmath36 , @xmath37 supports mass of @xmath38 .",
    "the latter can be seen via a simple argument .",
    "consider a variable @xmath39 distributed uniformly between @xmath40 and @xmath41 . since on average ,",
    "@xmath42 observations of @xmath39 will be equally spaced , it follows that the @xmath13th lowest observation in @xmath42 trials is typically at a distance @xmath43 above zero .",
    "since @xmath44 is inversely proportional to the separation between the lowest and the @xmath13th lowest hopping rate and @xmath45 can be related to the uniform distribution by a change of variables ( @xmath46 ) , one obtains @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the approach to the steady state for the symmetric , zero range process in one dimension with the hopping rates chosen from @xmath45 defined in eq.([fw ] ) .",
    "we first describe a simple picture of approach to the steady state",
    ". then we present an argument based on local equilibrium which suggests that the relaxation time scales with system size @xmath5 as @xmath6 with @xmath7 for @xmath8 .",
    "however , this treatment breaks down for @xmath9 .",
    "we first illustrate qualitatively the temporal sequence of events through which an aggregate with mass of @xmath49 is formed at the site with the lowest hopping rate , starting from a random initial condition in which each site has mass of order unity ( fig .",
    "[ tseries]a ) .",
    "the behaviour of the average mass @xmath50 for @xmath51 as a function of time is shown in fig .",
    "[ 4low ] . here",
    "@xmath52 is to be understood as an ensemble average over evolution histories .",
    "we find that @xmath53 rises steadily and then saturates to its steady state value while each of @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 rise , attain a maximum and then decay to their respective steady state values .",
    "this non - monotonic behavior is not hard to understand . at some finite time , each particle is able to move only a finite distance away from its initial position and tends to get temporarily trapped at the site with the lowest @xmath29 within the neighbourhood explored by it , rather than the global minimum @xmath30 .",
    "a typical configuration at such intermediate time thus has several large aggregates at such local minima while the rest of the system has masses of order unity ( fig .",
    "[ tseries]b ) .",
    "this explains why at short enough times , @xmath50 for @xmath51 are of the same order and increasing ( fig .",
    "[ 4low ] ) . as time progresses , the particles are able to access larger regions in space and identify new local minima",
    ". then the mass increases at these newly accessed local minima at the expense of the previous ones ( fig .",
    "[ tseries]c ) .",
    "this explains the drop in @xmath56 and @xmath55 after they have reached their respective peak values , though @xmath53 and @xmath54 continue to rise ( fig .",
    "[ 4low ] ) . finally , @xmath54 also starts dropping and the excess mass is transported to the location of the global minimum ( fig .",
    "[ tseries]d ) .",
    "once the global minimum is recognised by all the particles , the system reaches a steady state and @xmath57 for all @xmath13 .",
    "we now turn to an analytical description of the mechanism of the mass transport .",
    "the exact time evolution equation obeyed by @xmath58 for a given @xmath59 can be written as = w(k-1 ) s(k-1,t ) + w(k+1 ) s(k+1,t ) -2 w(k ) s(k , t ) .",
    "rho at large enough times , the system is expected to be in _ local _ equilibrium .",
    "this allows one to assume the @xmath60 relation to be approximately as in the steady state ( eq.([avgm ] ) ) . substituting for @xmath61 in the above equation",
    ", one obtains = g(k-1,t)+g(k+1,t)-2 g(k , t ) , current where @xmath62 .",
    "the treatment so far is valid for any density , but we are primarily interested in densities for which the system is in the infinite aggregate phase in the steady state . for such densities , at large times , one needs to divide the system into two sets ",
    "set @xmath63 composed of those sites which support rather large aggregates and set @xmath64 at which the masses are small and close to their steady state values ( see fig .",
    "[ 4low ] ) .",
    "the elements of these sets are not fixed in time ; with the passage of time , the number of elements in set @xmath63 reduce and that of set @xmath64 increase by the mechanism described at the beginning of this section .",
    "eventually , when the system is close to the steady state , set @xmath63 is left with a few isolated sites that support aggregates whose masses scale as a nonzero power of @xmath5 while the bulk of the sites belong to set @xmath64 .",
    "we are interested in the fluctuations in the density profile about the steady state , @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath66 is small for @xmath67 and very large for @xmath68 , an expansion in @xmath69 would be justified only for the background sites .",
    "below we first analyse these background ( @xmath64 ) sites and then treat the isolated sites in set @xmath63 as the boundaries of the @xmath64 regions . for the @xmath64 sites",
    ", we may retain the lowest order terms in an expansion of eq.([current ] ) in powers of @xmath66 and obtain = d(k-1 ) m(k-1,t ) + d(k+1 ) m(k+1,t ) -2 d(k ) m(k , t ) , , deltar with d(k)=(w(k)-c)^2/w(k ) .",
    "dx here we have used the fact that @xmath21 tends to @xmath3 in the infinite aggregate phase .    equation ( [ deltar ] ) describes a random walker in a random medium with site - dependent hopping rate @xmath70 . using eqs.([fw ] ) and ( [ dx ] )",
    ", we find that these rates are distributed according to the probability distribution @xmath71 for @xmath72 .",
    "note that whereas @xmath45 has a nonzero lower cutoff , @xmath73 has zero as the lower limit due to which it diverges as @xmath72 for @xmath9 .",
    "the problem of a particle moving with random , spatially inhomogeneous hopping rates is well studied and has been reviewed in @xcite . for a configuration of",
    "randomly distributed @xmath74 in a large system observed on large enough time scales , the mean squared displacement of the random walker grows as @xmath75 where the diffusion constant @xmath76 and @xmath77 stands for disorder average , provided @xmath78 is finite @xcite .",
    "thus for large spatial and time separations , the particle diffusion is described by a single , effective diffusion constant . in our case",
    ", one can calculate @xmath79 by noting that @xmath80 .",
    "expanding @xmath33 for @xmath21 close to @xmath3 , we obtain i(v ) & = & _ c + o(c - v ) , n > 1 + & = & _ c + o((c - v)^n ) , 0 <",
    "n < 1 , which implies that @xmath79 is finite for @xmath8 and diverges for @xmath9 . the divergence in the latter case indicates anomalous diffusion i.e. the mean squared displacement grows sublinearly . in the remainder , we will restrict ourselves to @xmath8 @xcite .    on averaging over disorder configurations , for a system of size @xmath5 , the mass @xmath81 on the site with lowest hopping rate",
    "is expected to scale as t^ h ( ) where h(x ) ~ . since @xmath82 in the steady state",
    ", it follows that @xmath83 .",
    "we now determine the relaxation time of the system by estimating the time @xmath84 required for @xmath85 to reach its steady state value for a typical realisation of disorder . at large enough times , the background sites in set @xmath64 form the bulk of the system whereas only a few isolated sites with low hopping rates belong to set @xmath63 .",
    "let us now consider time scales above which the two sites with the lowest rates ( i.e. @xmath30 and @xmath86 ) are the only elements left in set @xmath63 . as shown in fig .  [ 4low ] , @xmath54 drops after it has reached its peak while @xmath53 keeps rising at the expense of the former so that there is a net transfer of mass from the site with @xmath87 to the site with @xmath14 .",
    "one can think of these two sites as the boundaries to the bulk background region with the former site feeding particles at rate @xmath86 to the bulk and the latter at rate @xmath88 . on large time scales ,",
    "a quasi - equilibrium is established , and in view of the discussion above , the particles diffuse through the bulk with an effective diffusion constant @xmath89 .",
    "thus there is a transfer of mass at a rate @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 is the spatial separation between the two sites .",
    "the relaxation time @xmath93 , which is essentially the time taken to transfer the peak mass @xmath94 at the site with rate @xmath86 , is given by t = t_12= t12 .",
    "let us estimate the size dependence of the quantities that appear on the right hand side of the above equation .",
    "typically the separation @xmath92 is of order @xmath5 in which case @xmath95 is also of order @xmath5 .",
    "this is because for times earlier than when @xmath95 peaks , the site @xmath87 is the slowest one encountered by the particles in a finite fraction of the system .",
    "consequently , the numerator in the above equation is proportional to @xmath96 .",
    "this result holds even in the exceptional case when the sites with @xmath14 and @xmath87 are separated by a distance of order unity , as they behave effectively as a single slow site and one can use the same reasoning as above on replacing the site with @xmath87 by that with @xmath97 .",
    "further , using the argument given at the end of section  [ model ] , we find that the inverse rate separation @xmath98 scales as @xmath99 .",
    "collecting all the dependences , it follows that the relaxation time @xmath100 scales with system size @xmath5 as @xmath101 where z=2 + 1/(n+1),n > 1 .",
    "z we measured the growth of @xmath81 using monte carlo simulations and find that it grows as @xmath102 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ beta ] , our expression for @xmath103 is consistent with the numerics .",
    "we conclude this paper with a discussion of two open questions : @xmath104 we have seen that @xmath79 diverges for @xmath9 indicating anomalous diffusion , which suggests that the expression for @xmath105 in eq.([z ] ) may be invalid for @xmath9",
    ". it would be interesting to find how the system relaxes in this case .",
    "@xmath106 for the case with asymmetric hopping rates , using the arguments analogous to those given above , we would expect the dynamic exponent to be @xmath107 for @xmath8 .",
    "once again , we may anticipate a different result for @xmath9 . in @xcite and @xcite",
    "the dynamics of the asymmetric version has been analysed using numerical simulations and extremal statistics arguments for a related deterministic model .",
    "the expression for the dynamic exponent in @xcite is the same as quoted above but their arguments do not make a distinction between the regimes below and above @xmath108 .",
    "the elucidation of the anomalous regime for both the symmetric and asymmetric zero range process remains an interesting open problem .",
    "we will not attempt a summary of this paper .",
    "professor n. kumar once pointed out that since it is a part of the whole , a proper summary should include a summary of the summary and a summary of that summary , and so on .",
    "we would rather not try !",
