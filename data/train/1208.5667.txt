    "of particular note is the four - vortex configuration recently observed @xcite in the counterflow of superfluid helium ii past a circular cylinder , where stationary eddies formed both downstream and upstream of the cylinder .",
    "a possible explanation for this unusual vortex arrangement was given in ref .  [ 11 ] in terms of the complex interaction between the normal and superfluid components of he ii .",

    "the nonlinear dynamics in the symmetric subspace is briefly studied numerically and three general classes of orbits are found : i ) bounded orbits , ii ) semi - bounded orbits , and iii ) completely unbounded orbits . as for antisymmetric perturbations , it is shown that the equilibria are always unstable .",

    "the angle intervals are approximation within two significant digits . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from a practical standpoint , the most relevant information in table i is perhaps the fact that the equilibrium configurations located in regions i and ii are neutrally stable under symmetric perturbations .",
    "since symmetry can be enforced by placing a splitter plate in the middle plane behind the cylinder @xcite , this equilibrium could in principle be observed in experiments .",
    "of course , the difficulty here is to generate vortices in front of the cylinder .",

    "it nonetheless remains an open question whether four - vortex configurations with one pair of recirculating eddies on each side of the cylinder can be observed in real flows .",

    "[ sec : normal ] that there are no such equilibria in an unbounded plane .",
    "this means , in particular , that the four - vortex configuration observed in the counterflow of superfluid helium past a cylinder @xcite can not be realized in the flow of a classical fluid past a cylinder in an otherwise unbounded region .",
    "such configurations might however exist for flows past a cylinder confined in a rectangular channel , which was in fact the geometry used in the experiments @xcite . in this case",
    ", the channel walls tend to generate vortices in front of the cylinder with the opposite sign of the vortices behind it . indeed , recirculating eddies in front of a circular cylinder placed near a plane boundary",
    "have been observed @xcite when the gap between the cylinder and the plane is sufficiently small .",
    "it thus seems possible that confining the cylinder between two plane walls may induce the formation of a vortex pair in front of the cylinder with the opposite polarity of the pair behind it .    from a theoretical perspective , the treatment of point - vortex dynamics in the presence of a cylinder placed between two plane walls is a much more complicated problem because of the infinitely many vortex images that one has to consider .",
    "we are currently investigating this problem .",
    "the existence of stationary configurations for opposite - signed vortex pairs on the opposite sides of the cylinder ( if found ) would be of considerable interest because it could explain the four - vortex configurations reported in ref .  [",
    "11 ] entirely within the scope of classical fluid mechanics , without having to invoke the two - fluid model of superfluid helium .",
    "we have presented a detailed study of the stationary configurations and their stability for two pairs of point vortices placed in a uniform flow past a circular cylinder .",
    "we have shown that among the possible same - signed equilibria there exists a large subset of configurations that , although unstable under generic perturbations , are stable with respect to symmetric perturbations .",
    "the nonlinear dynamics within the symmetric subspace was also studied , and here we found three general classes of orbits : i ) bounded orbits around the stable equilibrium , ii ) semi - bounded orbits where one of the vortex pairs is attracted to the fppl equilibrium while the other pair goes to infinity , and iii ) completely unbounded orbits where both vortex pairs move to infinity .",
    "we have obtained , furthermore , a previously unknown set of opposite - signed equilibria for which the vortices lie on the line bisecting the cylinder perpendicularly to the incoming flow . finally , we have suggested that if the cylinder is confined in a rectangular channel then equilibrium configurations for two opposite - signed vortex pairs should exist with one vortex pair windward of the cylinder and the other pair in the leeward side .",
