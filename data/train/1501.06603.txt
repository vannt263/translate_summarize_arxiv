    "<S> many iterative methods for solving optimization or feasibility problems have been invented , and often convergence of the iterates to some solution is proven . under favourable conditions , one might have additional bounds on the distance of the iterate to the solution leading thus to _ worst case estimates _ </S>",
    "<S> , i.e. , how fast the algorithm must converge .    </S>",
    "<S> exact convergence estimates are typically hard to come by . in this paper , we consider the complementary problem of finding _ best case estimates _ , i.e. , how slow the algorithm has to converge , and we also study _ exact asymptotic rates of convergence_. our investigation focuses on convex feasibility in the euclidean plane , where one set is the real axis while the other is the epigraph of a convex function . </S>",
    "<S> this case study allows us to obtain various convergence rate results . </S>",
    "<S> we focus on the popular method of alternating projections and the douglas  rachford algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> these methods are connected to the proximal point algorithm which is also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> our findings suggest that the douglas  rachford algorithm outperforms the method of alternating projections in the absence of constraint qualifications . </S>",
    "<S> various examples illustrate the theory .    * </S>",
