    "the popularity of complex networks in the description of interactions among individuals in various biological and social contexts has inspired theoretical studies of ordering phenomena on networks in recent years  @xcite .",
    "the small - world properties of such networks , as emphasized first by watts and strogatz  @xcite , suggest that a simple mean - field ( mf ) description of the ordering transition is often appropriate  @xcite .",
    "more complicated situations may arise as in , e.g. , scale - free networks with a low degree exponent , where heterogeneity in the network topology smears out the transition significantly  @xcite .",
    "in general , randomness in network connections , which can be considered as a form of quenched disorder , can have a profound effect on the ordering process and the ensuing scaling behavior .",
    "this is a topic in the network research which has not been sufficiently explored so far .",
    "synchronization of coupled oscillators is a representative dynamical problem on complex networks  @xcite . by varying the coupling strength @xmath8 among the oscillators , various dynamical phenomena",
    "can be observed , ranging from independent oscillators at @xmath9 to fully synchronized state at @xmath10 .",
    "the desynchronization threshold @xmath11 is an important property in many applications and its dependence on the network topology has been investigated in great detail  @xcite . for coupled oscillators with a distribution of intrinsic frequencies  @xcite , a finite fraction of the population can remain entrained in frequency even in the presence of a large number of run - away oscillators .",
    "the entrained cluster of oscillators disappears only at a ( much ) lower coupling strength @xmath12 . near the entrainment threshold @xmath12 ,",
    "strong fluctuations in various static and dynamic properties of the system are expected , as in usual critical phenomena .",
    "the entrainment transition on scale - free networks with the degree distribution @xmath13 has been treated analytically by several groups  @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that , in the infinite size limit , the transition is expected at a finite coupling strength for @xmath14 , while the entrained cluster persists at any nonzero coupling strength for @xmath15 .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath6 describing vanishing behavior of the order parameter on the supercritical side is shown to be equal to @xmath16 for @xmath4 and @xmath17 for @xmath18  @xcite .    for systems of finite size ,",
    "the entrainment transition becomes blurred and rounded over a range of the coupling strength .",
    "in addition , randomness in the network topology , as well as the random choice of oscillator frequencies , introduces sample - to - sample variations in the entrainment threshold .",
    "a full description of the finite size effects , which requires a detailed characterization of dynamic fluctuations in specific samples , is currently not available  @xcite .",
    "fortunately , in the case of the globally coupled kuramoto model where the mean - field theory works well on the supercritical side , the sample - to - sample fluctuations of the order parameter can be characterized analytically  @xcite .",
    "comparison with numerical simulations indicates that temporal fluctuations of the order parameter only play a subdominant role in the broadening of the transition region due to finite size  @xcite .",
    "the success of this approach suggests a novel procedure to derive finite - size scaling ( fss ) relations under a mf approximation .    in the present paper , we extend the above mf treatment to coupled random frequency oscillators on complex networks . unlike the globally coupled case",
    ", the mf equations derived here are not expected to be exact due to the finite connectivity of individual vertices on the network . nevertheless , as we show below",

    "we also present results from extensive simulations on uncorrelated scale - free networks .",
    "the numerically determined values of the exponents as a function of the degree exponent @xmath7 of the network agree well with the analytic predictions .",
    "our study indicates that the fss at the entrainment transition on uncorrelated scale - free networks is also governed by fluctuations in the distribution of intrinsic oscillator frequencies , with temporal order parameter fluctuations playing a less dominant role .",

    "( [ eq : km_onsfn ] ) can now be written in a more suggestive form , @xmath34    as usual , the mean - field approximation decouples the set of @xmath19 dynamical equations by replacing @xmath35 and @xmath33 with suitable time - averaged quantities which are then determined in a self - consistent manner . unlike the globally coupled kuramoto model ,",
    "such a mean - field treatment is not exact due to the finite connectivity of individual oscillators on the network , so dynamic fluctuations are not averaged out even for an infinite system .",
    "however , provided the network is sufficiently well connected ( as compared to fragmentation into local `` communities '' ) , and because of its small - world properties , once a cluster of entrained oscillators is formed , it will affect the dynamics of all oscillators in the system through a _",

    "the precise effect of the global field on individual oscillators is subject to renormalization by the local community of a given oscillator . for a well - connected network",

    "this is to be confirmed by numerical investigations .    with the above caveat ,",
    "let us proceed to the derivation of the mean - field equations , with particular emphasis on the finite size effect .",

( [ eq : h - eq ] ) and ( [ eq : omega ] ) it is obvious that the solution for @xmath39 depends not only on the coupling strength @xmath8 but also on the particular choice of the intrinsic frequencies @xmath55 as well as the particular network topology in a given sample . for sufficiently large @xmath19 , it is possible to give a statistical description of the sample - to - sample fluctuations .",
