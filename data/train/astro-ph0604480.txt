    "compact steep - spectrum ( css ) and giga - hertz peaked spectrum ( gps ) sources constitute a large fraction of the powerful ( log@xmath5 ) radio source population .",
    "morphologically , they are compact and often only partially resolved on milliarcsecond scales , with projected linear sizes of less than @xmath6 and @xmath7 for gps and css , respectively .",
    "however , these objects are not just radio cores , rather they constitute complete systems with small - scale jets and lobes .",
    "two scenarios have been proposed that attempt to explain the css / gps phenomenon ( see odea 1998 for a review ) .",
    "the first is that css / gps sources form stages of an evolutionary sequence for all large radio sources .",
    "the more compact objects ( gps ) are the youngest sources which , with time , expand in size to form css and eventually large radio objects ( the youth scenario ) .",
    "the second picture is that css / gps sources are kept compact by high density material which inhibits the radio source from expanding ( frustrated scenario ) .",
    "the radio spectra of gps sources show curvature with peaks above @xmath8 .",
    "css objects are characterised by steep spectra ( @xmath9 ) with a low - frequency , often undetectable , turnover ( e.g. @xmath10 ) .",
    "perhaps the strongest evidence linking gps and css sources is the relationship ( anticorrelation ) between turnover frequency and projected linear size ( fanti 1990 ; odea & baum 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , it has been suggested that gps sources evolve into css sources , and perhaps eventually into fr - i / ii objects in a self - similar manner ( snellen 2003 ) .",
    "studies of the class properties of css / gps quasars at other wavebands are less complete , but to first - order the observations are not radically different from non - css , radio - loud quasars .",
    "the far - infrared @xmath11 luminosities are consistent with arising from agn , similar to extended , radio - loud quasars ( e.g. heckman 1994 ) .",
    "there is some evidence for an additional component in the near - infrared ( nir ) , which could be due to emission from @xmath12 dust , possibly from an agn heated torus ( de vries 1998 ) .",
    "host galaxies are comparable between gps , css , and fr - ii ( e.g. de vries 2000 ) .",
    "optical spectra are rich in emission lines , similar to extended radio sources ( e.g. morganti 1997 ) and the emission is aligned with the radio source suggesting interaction of the two mediums ( e.g. the radio source shocks the emission - line gas ) in the production of lines ( e.g. gelderman & whittle 1994 ; de vries 1998 ; bicknell 1997 ; labiano 2005 ) . until recently there has been little focus on x - ray studies of css / gps sources , primarily because they appear to be x - ray dim ( baker 1995 ) .",
    "this could be because of additional x - ray absorption , which has been detected in many objects of this class ( e.g. elvis 1994 ; guainazzi 2006 ; vink 2006 ) .",
    "recent studies with  and  show that the x - ray spectra of gps source are well characterised by a single power law modified by intrinsic absorption ( guainazzi 2006 ; vink 2006 ) .",
    "x - ray variability on hourly time scales has only been reported for one gps , coins  j@xmath13 ( guainazzi 2006 ) .    in this work",
    "we examine the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of one css source , . the pkscat90 catalog ( wright & otrupcek 1990 ) gives flux density measurements at frequencies between 408 mhz and 8.4 ghz for .",
    "these were not contemporaneous , but suggest that the slope of the radio spectrum is @xmath14 at low frequencies , steepening to @xmath15 at higher frequencies",
    ".    also shows evidence for having an angular size of @xmath16 , as observations on the @xmath17 baseline of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) have revealed that @xmath18 per cent of the flux density is unresolved at 8.6 ghz ( lovell 1997 ; tasker 2000 ) .",
    "the source is partially resolved on longer baselines  on the @xmath19 parkes  tidbinbilla interferometer baseline a correlated flux density at 2.3 ghz of @xmath20 jy was measured , in comparison to a contemporaneous total flux density of @xmath21 jy .",
    "however , the @xmath22 ghz single - baseline vlbi survey of preston ( 1985 ) yielded a correlated flux density of @xmath23 jy on a @xmath24 baseline , indicating the presence of a compact , parsec - scale core .",
    "the steep spectrum at cm wavelengths and sub - arcsecond structure match the criteria for css sources ( fanti 1990 ) .",
    "a comparison of all reported flux density measurements for the source indicates that the source displays variability of @xmath25 per cent on the timescale of years at cm wavelengths .",
    "moderate slow variability of css sources is not uncommon at these frequencies ( e.g. , edwards & tingay 2004 ) .",
    "has encountered controversy ( oshlack 2001 , hereafter osh01 ; zhou 2003 ; sulentic 2003 ) with its optical definition as a narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxy ( nls1 ) . by optical definition , nls1 have narrow permitted lines ( fwhm()@xmath26 ) , weak ( @xmath27 ) , and strong  ( see osterbrock & pogge 1985 and goodrich 1989 ) .",
    "satisfies the first two criteria , but has weak  ( osh01 ) . however , there is no formal , qualitative definition for the   strength , which leaves the interpretation open for debate .",
    "it is also important to note that nls1 are believed to be young agn ( e.g. grupe 1996 ; mathur 2000 ) .",
    "they possess smaller black hole masses and higher accretion rates compared to typical seyfert 1s of similar luminosities .",
    "they also appear to have super - solar metallicities , and many objects have high ir fluxes , which could be attributed to rapid and/or intense episodes of star formation .",
    "five other radio - loud nls1 are known , which have more secure confirmation of the nls1 characteristics : pks0558504 ( remillard 1986 ) , rgb j0044 + 142 ( siebert 1999 ; though the radio - loudness of this object is questionable , maccarone 2005 ) , rxj01344258 ( grupe 2000 ) , sdss j094857.3 + 002225 ( zhou 2003 ; doi 2006 ) , and sdss j172206.03 + 565451.6 ( komossa 2006a ) .",
    "whalen ( 2006 ) have recently identified 16 new radio - loud nls1 , but radio spectra are not yet available .    for five of the above mentioned objects ( including )",
    "the radio spectra reveal that all but pks0558504 are consistent with the css or gps definition .",
    "this is of interest for three reasons .",
    "firstly , nls1 objects as a class lie on one extreme end of `` eigenvector 1 ''  the anti - correlation between  and  strength ( boroson & green 1992 ; see also brandt & boller 1997 ) .",
    "nls1 show the most extreme  emission and weakest , while radio - loud objects form the other extreme .",
    "optically selected samples of nls1 are notoriously radio - quiet ( e.g. greene 2006 ) .",
    "secondly , nls1 are considered to be in the early stages of agn evolution ( grupe 1996 ; mathur 2000 ) , as are gps / css sources .",
    "though based on very different arguments , the connection between gps / css and nls1 , and agn evolution is intriguing .",
    "finally , while css and gps sources make up a considerable fraction of radio selected samples ( @xmath0 and @xmath28 per cent , respectively ) , the fraction may be significantly higher when considering radio - loud nls1 .    in this work we scrutinise the css / nls1 source  across the sed using simultaneous x - ray , near - uv , optical , near - ir , and radio data obtained 2004 april 1112 , with the intention of understanding the connection between css and nls1 sources .",
    "the rest of the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the observations and data reduction are described in section 2 .",
    "analysis of the radio , and x - ray data are presented in section 3 , and 4 , respectively .",
    "the sed of  is considered in section 5 .",
    "discussion and summary follow in section 6 and 7 , respectively .",
    "a value for the galactic column density toward  of @xmath29 ( dickey & lockman 1990 ) is adopted in all of the spectral fits .",
    "k - corrected luminosities are calculated using a hubble constant of @xmath30=@xmath31 and a standard flat cosmology with @xmath32 = 0.3 and @xmath33 = 0.7 .",
    "the redshift of  is @xmath34 ( drinkwater 1997 ) and the corresponding luminosity distance is 1.2  gpc .",
    "was observed with  ( jansen et al .",
    "2001 ) for approximately @xmath35 between 2004 april 11 - 12 ( revolution 795 ; obsid 0200360201 ) . during this time all on - board instruments functioned normally .",
    "the epic pn ( strder et al . 2001 ) and mos ( mos1 and mos2 ; turner 2001 ) cameras were operated in full - frame mode with the medium filter in place .",
    "the reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs1 and rgs2 ; den herder et al .",
    "2001 ) also collected data during this time , as did the optical monitor ( om ; mason et al .",
    "2001 ) . due to the low count rate",
    ", the rgs data were mostly background dominated and will not be discussed further .",
    "the observation data files ( odfs ) were processed to produce calibrated event lists using the  science analysis system ( xmm - sas v6.5.0 ) and the most recent calibration files .",
    "unwanted hot , dead , or flickering pixels were removed as were events due to electronic noise .",
    "event energies were corrected for charge - transfer losses , and time - dependent epic response matrices were generated using the sas tasks arfgen and rmfgen .",
    "light curves were extracted from these event lists to search for periods of high background flaring , which were subsequently removed .",
    "the total resulting exposures were @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the pn , mos1 and mos2 , respectively .",
    "the source plus background photons were extracted from a circular region with a radius of 35@xmath39 , and the background was selected from an off - source region with a radius of 50@xmath39 and appropriately scaled to the source region .",
    "single and double events were selected for the pn spectra , and single - quadruple events were selected for the mos .",
    "the spectra were source dominated between @xmath40 with a total of @xmath41 and @xmath42 source counts collected by the pn and mos instruments , respectively .",
    "pile - up was negligible in all instruments .    .",
    "optical monitor observations of . filters and corresponding wavelengths",
    "are given in columns 1 and 2 , respectively .",
    "the flux density in each filter is reported in column 3 . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "atca pointings were obtained at 1.4 , 2.4 , 4.8 , 4.9 , 5.1 , 8.6 , 17.7 and 17.9 ghz .",
    "a power law fit to the spectrum produced a spectral slope of @xmath43 .",
    "flux densities are given in table  [ tab : rad ] .",
    "calculating the radio loudness ( @xmath44 , kellerman 1989 ) from simultaneous optical and radio data resulted in @xmath45 confirming the high radio - loudness of this object .",
    "for the majority of the nearly six month period ( 2004 february 5 - july 20 ) that ceduna monitored  the source exhibited relatively little variability ; however , in the period just prior to the  monitoring significant variations were observed at radio wavelengths . over a period of 19 days between 2004 march 10 - 29 ( day 6887 of year 2004 ) the flux density at 6.65  ghz increased by approximately one - third , from @xmath46  mjy to @xmath47  mjy ( figure  [ fig : cedlc ] ) .",
    "if we assume that the observed variation is intrinsic to the source ( rather than due to a propagation effect such as interstellar scintillation ) , then causality limits the linear size of the varying component to be @xmath48 .",
    "so for timescale of 19 days in a source at a redshift of 0.24 the linear size of the variable component in the source frame is less than @xmath49  km ( 0.02  pc ) .",
    "we emphasis that the size of the entire radio emitting region is likely on pc scales . with our adopted cosmology ,",
    "the luminosity distance for  is @xmath50  pc which requires the angular size of the variable component to be less than 3.4  @xmath51as ( micro - arcseconds ) .",
    "this implies that the brightness temperature of the variable component in the source frame is @xmath52k , well in excess of the inverse compton limit of @xmath53k ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1969 ) .",
    "there are two possibilities that can account for this ,",
    "one is that the jet has a doppler boosting factor of approximately 6 which reduces observed brightness temperature to around the inverse compton limit . alternatively , since the ceduna and atca observations show that approximately 10 days later the radio flux density of the source had returned to its long - term mean value of around 450  mjy , it may be that the component dissipated over that period due to inverse compton scattering .",
    "the argument above assumes that the observed radio variations are due to intrinsic changes in the source .",
    "however , an angular size of the order of a few microarcseconds for the variable component is sufficiently small that we would expect it to show interstellar scintillation ( e.g. bignall 2003 ) . in general the ceduna light curve over the period in question shows a steady increase in the flux density of the source , however , there is a sudden change around day 81 of year 2004 .",
    "if intrinsic , this change of around 100  mjy on a timescale of about 3 days implies brightness temperatures of around @xmath54k , alternatively , it may be that this variation is in fact due to scintillation of the component responsible for the 19-day timescale change .",
    "although we monitored  for approximately half a year , significant variability was only detected over a short period .",
    "css / gps sources are typically not doppler boosted , but there are examples to the contrary ( e.g. odea 1998 ; aller 2002 ; stanghellini 2005 ) . to our knowledge ,",
    "ours was one of the most intense monitoring campaigns of a css source , so it is difficult to determine if the behaviour exhibited by  is characteristic of css sources . in any regard , our campaign shows that daily radio frequency monitoring of such sources from programmes such as cosmic ( mcculloch 2005 ) can reveal phenomena that are likely to be missed by more traditional monitoring where the interval between observations is weeks or months .",
    "we began the x - ray spectral analysis by fitting the observed @xmath55 spectrum of each epic instrument with a single power law .",
    "finding relatively good agreement within the uncertainties we proceeded by fitting the three spectra together .",
    "the power law fit to the @xmath55 epic spectrum resulted in a good fit ( @xmath56 ) with a photon index of @xmath57 .    extrapolating this power law to",
    "@xmath58 revealed an excess forming toward lower energies ( figure  [ fig : po ] ) . even though refitting a single power law to the @xmath40 spectrum ( @xmath59 ) resulted in an acceptable fit ( @xmath60 ) positive residuals remained below @xmath61 .    replacing the single power law with a broken power law provided significant improvement ( @xmath62 for 2 additional free parameters ) with an f - test probability of @xmath63 . in this case the high - energy and low - energy power laws had @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively , with the break occurring at @xmath66 .",
    "additional neutral absorption at the redshift of  was considered in all of the attempted models , but not found to be required .",
    "the @xmath67 per - cent upper limit on the column density of any such absorber is @xmath68 .",
    "the existence of an emission feature at fe  energies , which could arise from a putative torus or accretion disc was also examined .",
    "again , considering such a feature did not significantly improve existing fits .",
    "the @xmath67 per - cent upper limit on the equivalent width of a narrow emission line between @xmath69 was @xmath70 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of  is unusually flat for a nls1 , but not unlike radio - loud agn .",
    "there is a slight indication of a weak soft excess below @xmath71 , which is typical of nls1 , but also comparable to the broken power law seen in flat - spectrum radio quasar ( fsrq ) and low - energy - peaked bl lacs . on the other hand , x - ray spectral studies of samples of gps sources ( guainazzi 2006 and vink 2006 ) do not show evidence of soft excess emission .",
    "we note that statistically a single power law provides a satisfactory fit , and that higher quality data are required to pin down the existence of soft excess emission in .    from the broken power law fit to the epic data , an unabsorbed @xmath40 flux of @xmath72 is estimated . the intrinsic @xmath40 and @xmath55 luminosities are @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "short - term flux variations were examined over the @xmath35 observation of .",
    "the @xmath75 light curve ( figure  [ fig : lc ] , upper panel ) shows some variability ( @xmath76 ) , most of it appearing as a @xmath77 per cent rise in count rate during the final @xmath78 .",
    "spectral variations with time were searched for by constructing a hardness ratio ( @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) variability curve ( figure  [ fig : lc ] , lower panel ) .",
    "the energy bands were selected to examine the potentially components on either side of the break energy predicted by the broken power law model ( section  [ sect : xsp ] ) .",
    "the hardness ratio curve is not highly variable when compared to a constant fit ( @xmath82 ) , but there is a softening trend over the course of the observation .",
    "therefore , it does seem plausible that multiple components may be present in the x - ray continuum .",
    "the only other x - ray observation of  was a detection during the  all - sky survey ( rass ; voges 1999 ) . at that time",
    "it was detected as a faint source with a @xmath83 count rate of @xmath84 ( siebert 1998 ) . assuming a photon index in this energy band of either 2.10 or 1.56 ( as derived from our broken power law and power law fits in section  [ sect : xsp ] ) , the unabsorbed @xmath85 flux is @xmath86 or @xmath87 , respectively . in this same energy band ,",
    "the  flux is @xmath88 .",
    "this indicates that , at the very least , modest x - ray variability on about the @xmath77 per cent level occurs on yearly time scales .",
    "this level of variability is comparable with the centimetre fluctuations on similar time scales seen in .",
    "we considered the possibility that the sed of  is generated by synchrotron plus synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) processes .",
    "such models are reasonably successful in describing the sed of blazars and even some un - beamed radio galaxies ( e.g. chiaberge 2001 ) .",
    "the adopted model ( kataoka 1999 ) assumes a single zone homogeneous ssc in a spherical volume , which is probably an oversimplification , but allows the source to be modelled in a self - consistent way with a minimum of parameters , and is not unreasonable given the compactness of .",
    "given the modest radio variability ( sect  [ sect : idv ] ) , models with large doppler beaming factors are not considered .",
    "the model shown in figure  [ fig : sed4 ] reproduces the general trend of the sed quite well ; however it significantly under estimates the radio emission .",
    "such discrepancies in the radio are found in many studies and it is believed to be a consequence of the radio emission originating from a much larger region than the x - rays and gamma - rays .",
    "even so , the current region size ( @xmath89 ) is too large to account for the short - term x - ray variability ( sect .",
    "[ sect : xv ] ) .",
    "furthermore , explaining the high x - ray brightness would require a large electron - to - magnetic energy density ratio ( @xmath90 ) for the ssc component . in extreme objects such as blazars ,",
    "the ratio is typically less than 100 , whereas for all the x - ray emission to be produced by the single zone ssc model in the ratio would have to be about 250 .",
    "we have examined whether the sed can be constrained by data at higher energies .",
    "mattox ( 2001 ) made a quantitative evaluation of potential radio identifications for 3eg egret sources based on the 5 ghz flux density , spectral index , and proximity to the egret source of candidate counterparts .",
    "was considered as a counterpart to the unidentified egret source 3eg j1958@xmath914443 , however the association had an a posteriori probability of less than @xmath92 and so was considered unlikely ( although no more likely candidates were found ) .",
    "even considering the sed model with a very high @xmath90 , the predicted @xmath93 flux density falls below the detection sensitivity of egret .    a synchrotron / ssc model , which adopts a much larger emitting region characterises the radio - to - uv emission quite well ( figure  [ fig : sed5 ] ) . on the other hand , assuming equipartition conditions or moderate particle - dominated parameters , the ssc model under estimates the observed x - ray emission by an order of magnitude ( figure  [ fig : sed5 ] ) .",
    "this may not be unreasonable if the sed is a combination of jet emission and disc / halo emission as typically seen in seyfert 1s .",
    "indeed the short term x - ray variability is consistent with originating from a much smaller region than most of the radio emission .",
    "we probe this further by re - examining the  x - ray data .",
    "the data are refitted with a thermal comptonisation model ( titarchuk 1994 ) plus an underlying power law to mimic the ssc component .",
    "the photon index of the ssc power law is fixed to @xmath94 ( similar to the slope of the radio spectrum ) , while the normalisation is allowed to vary freely .",
    "this produces a good fit ( @xmath95 ) similar to the broken power law model in section  [ sect : xsp ] . the model parameters : plasma temperature",
    "( @xmath96 ) , optical depth ( @xmath97 ) and seed photon temperature ( @xmath98 ) are not inconsistent with physical conditions expected in agn where the seed photons provided by the accretion disc are up - scattered to higher energies by the hot electron corona .",
    "of course , the values are uncertain given the known degeneracy between @xmath99 and @xmath100 . in this interpretation",
    "the flux density of the underlying power law is @xmath101 at @xmath102 , consistent with originating from the ssc component with @xmath103 ( figure  [ fig : sed6 ] ) .",
    "a second issue is the slight excess seen in the infrared data compared to the synchrotron models shown in figures  [ fig : sed4 ] and  [ fig : sed5 ] . de vries ( 1998 ) recognised this ir excess in other css sources and attributed it to a @xmath12 blackbody arising from an agn heated torus .",
    "we draw a similar conclusion for the ir emission in , which can be fitted by a blackbody with a temperature of about @xmath104 ( figure  [ fig : sed6 ] ) .",
    "overall , the inclusion of these additional component to the synchrotron / ssc continuum provides a reasonable approximation of the sed of  ( solid line in figure  [ fig : sed6 ] ) .",
    "the shape of the sed of  portrays the typical double - hump form that is often seen in radio - loud , blazar - type agn .",
    "the single zone homogeneous synchrotron / ssc interpretation appears to be a good base model .",
    "however , the fact that the normally constant , long - term radio light curve shows occasional activity and because the x - ray emission is apparently excessive , indicate that a single zone model is probably an oversimplification .      utilising the simultaneous uv data we calculated the optical - to - x - ray spectral slope ( @xmath105 ) of  to be approximately @xmath106 . considering the uv luminosity dependence of @xmath105 for radio - quiet , unabsorbed agn ( e.g. nls1 ) a value of @xmath107 is predicted ( strateva 2005 ) indicating that the spectral slope of  is flat compared to nls1-type objects .",
    "we also calculated the spectral slopes between the radio and optical ( @xmath108 ) , and radio and x - rays ( @xmath109 ) as shown by padovani ( 2002 ) for a sample of blazar - type objects . in comparing the values of all the spectral indices measured for to the padovani sample",
    ", it is found that the characteristics of are very similar to fsrq .",
    "essentially ,  resembles a radio - loud quasar , but with several atypical properties ( e.g. ir excess but no intrinsic x - ray absorption , normally low radio and x - ray variability , nls1 classification ) , and from the sed modelling the only way to recover a typical blazar sed is with a very large @xmath90 .      as seen in figures  [ fig : sed4 ] and [ fig : sed5 ] simple synchrotron / ssc models are unable to simultaneously fit the radio and x - ray emission .",
    "the shortcoming is apparently the difficulty in fitting the `` too bright '' x - ray emission in .",
    "the high x - ray brightness could be explained by a large @xmath110 .",
    "however , this is quite unusual compared to other types of jet - dominated objects .",
    "alternatively , the x - ray emission could require an additional component , which originates close to the black hole .",
    "the presence of some short - term x - ray variability and normally constant radio variability implies that the x - ray emitting region is probably much smaller than the radio one .",
    "the sed of  is well approximated if in addition to a synchrotron / ssc continuum , the model takes on a comptonisation component to describe the strong x - ray emission ( empirically , a single or broken power law fit the x - rays adequately ) . in this case , the derived model parameters are not atypical of expected physical conditions in agn .",
    "excess emission in the ir has been seen in other css sources ( de vries 1998 ) ; therefore its presence in  is not unexpected .",
    "this excess can be fit with a @xmath104 blackbody , which is consistent with originating in an agn heated torus , but notably also close to the sublimation temperature of dust .",
    "the host galaxy can not be excluded for contributing to this component .",
    "however , the optical spectra shown in osh01 do not exhibit any striking galactic features , so we consider it unlikely that the host galaxy dominates this spectral region .",
    "the absence of big blue bump emission at uv energies could imply reddening of the optical spectrum by this component .",
    "the balmer decrement ( / ) was measured in  using the low - resolution optical spectrum shown in figure 2 of osh01 .",
    "the ratio was /@xmath111 for the narrow - line region ( nlr ) lines , with considerable uncertainty arising from the difficulty in isolating the narrow component from the broad component in the fit ( @xmath112 per cent ) . assuming that the narrow balmer lines are due to case b recombination then by following the example of veilleux ( 1999 ) , and using the parameterised reddening curve for our galaxy ( miller & mathews 1972 ) the amount of intrinsic extinction in the nlr of can be estimated .",
    "if the ratio of total to selective extinction is 3.1 then the visible extinction in  is @xmath113 . even within the large range of uncertainty",
    "the extinction is significantly higher than the estimated intrinsic column density found in the x - ray spectral fits ( @xmath114 ) .",
    "following predehl & schmitt ( 1995 ) , the x - ray measurements give @xmath115 .    the discrepancy could be understood if  had a very different gas - to - dust ratio than our galaxy .",
    "this could perhaps be achieved as the radio jet , which likely terminates on nlr - scales in , deposits material from the nucleus into the nlr .",
    "it would be of interest to examine this issue in other css / gps sources to determine if the discrepancy in x - ray and optically measured @xmath116 is a class property .",
    "the radio properties of  satisfy the css definition of the source .",
    "however , the optical spectral properties are not entirely consistent with the general behaviour of css sources ( e.g. gelderman & whittle 1994 , morganti 1997 ) .",
    "osh01 proposed a nls1 classification for because of its relatively weak  emission and narrow  line .",
    "the classification has prompted some debate primarily due to the lack of strong  emission in , and it has been suggested that  is probably a type 2 agn ( e.g. sulentic 2003 , zhou 2003 ) .",
    "however , the x - ray emission is unabsorbed , and there is evidence for short - term variability and a weak soft excess .",
    "moreover , the  emission is relatively weak and the  emission is variable on at least yearly time scales ( osh01 ) indicating that the broad - line region is probably visible . for the sake of argument , in this discussion we will treat as a nls1 .    as such , there are four rather securely identified radio - loud nls1 and perhaps two more questionable objects (  and rgb  j0044 + 193 ) , which have been relatively well examined . nonetheless , of particular interest",
    "is that five of these six objects display steep or inverted radio spectra , which are consistent with radio definitions of css / gps sources .",
    "this coincidence in definitions presents a challenging area of research , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , radio - loud agn and nls1 occupy distinctly different regions of the primary eigenvector 1 parameter space ( boroson & green ) .",
    "nls1 are typically very radio - quiet .",
    "secondly , the fraction of radio - loud nls1 which are css / gps sources ( 5/6 ) is potentially much higher than the fraction of css / gps sources in radio selected sample ( @xmath117 per cent ) .",
    "thirdly , both classes of objects are believed to be in the early stages of agn evolution .",
    "this implies that radio - loud nls1 could be css / gps sources , perhaps in a situation where the black hole environment and the radio component are forming simultaneously .",
    "we compared some of the nls1-css / gps sources mentioned above with x - ray samples of gps objects ( from vink 2006 and guainazzi 2006 ) to determine how similar the two groups appear .",
    "our findings are illustrated in figure  [ fig : lxlr ] and [ fig : nhlx ] where the nls1-css / gps objects ( , rxj01344258 , rgb  j0044 + 193 ) are shown as filled squares ( a common cosmology is adopted for the figures ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : lxlr ] we note that the nls1-css / gps objects appear to have stronger x - ray emission compared to the radio emission than typical gps sources , which are known to be x - ray weak .",
    "this is in line with the additional x - ray component required to fit the sed of .",
    "the significant , rapid x - ray variability seen in the three objects ( see grupe for rxj01344258 and siebert for rgb  j0044 + 193 ) indicate that , like , the x - ray emission region is not extended .    in figure  [ fig : nhlx ]",
    "a comparison is made between the amount of intrinsic absorption seen in nls1-css / gps and the gps sample .",
    "there is support that lower intrinsic absorption is seen in the nls1-css / gps , independent of x - ray luminosity .",
    "significant statements can not be made given the small samples presented in figure  [ fig : lxlr ] and [ fig : nhlx ] ; however , there is an indication that nls1-css / gps and ` typical ' gps sources differ in x - ray behaviour .",
    "an investigation of the sed of , a css and possible radio - loud nls1 , is presented , utilising contemporaneous x - ray , near - uv , optical , near - ir , and radio data .",
    "the main results are summarised here .    *",
    "the sed can not be fitted by a single zone homogeneous ssc model .",
    "primarily , the difficulty is in simultaneously fitting the radio and excessive x - ray emission .",
    "models in which a second component ( probably arising from comptonisation of accretion disc photons ) is adopted to describe the x - ray emission or ssc models that require very high values of @xmath90 seem plausible .",
    "* excess emission is also seen in the sed at ir energies .",
    "in fact , the peak emission in the sed appears to be in the ir .",
    "this excess can be well fitted with a @xmath2 blackbody , likely originating from an agn heated torus ; however we can not exclude some contribution from the host galaxy .",
    "no excess absorption ( above galactic column density ) or fluorescent iron line is detected in the x - ray spectrum , as expected if the x - rays transverse a high column density .",
    "analysis of a non - contemporaneous , low - resolution optical spectrum suggests that the nlr is much more reddened than the x - ray emitting region .",
    "this could arise if the gas - to - dust ratio in  is very different than in our own galaxy , but further analysis of higher quality optical spectra are required to draw firm conclusions .",
    "* long - term radio monitoring of  shows a rather constant light curve over a six month period with the exception of one event when the @xmath3  ghz flux increases by @xmath4 per cent in 19 days .",
    "interstellar scintillation can not be excluded as the cause of the variability , but the detection of the rare event demonstrates the potential of intense monitoring campaigns such as cosmic ( mcculloch 2005 ) .",
    "no matter whether the outburst has an intrinsic or extrinsic origin , it indicates a small emitting region for at least some of the radio flux .",
    "* there is some indication of a possible connection between nls1 and css / gps sources . in comparison to other gps sources , these radio - loud nls1 seem to exhibit greater x - ray emission relative to radio flux , and lower intrinsic absorption .",
    "however , a larger and more uniformly selected sample is required to draw convincing conclusions .",
    "the recent discovery of a large number of radio - loud nls1 ( whalen 2006 , komossa 2006b ) holds many possibilities for future investigations of the potential connection between radio - loud nls1 and css / gps sources .",
