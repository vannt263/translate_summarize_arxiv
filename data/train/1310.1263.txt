    "observations of high - energy neutrinos have important implications for understanding the origin of pev - eev cosmic rays ( crs ) , because the collisions of hadronic crs with background nuclei or photons produce , among other particles , charged mesons whose decay products include neutrinos : ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) .",
    "two pev neutrinos were detected by the icecube neutrino detector during the combined ic-79/ic-86 data period @xcite .",
    "more recently , follow - up analysis by the icecube collaboration uncovered 26 additional sub  pev neutrinos @xcite . they show that these 28 events in total , ranging from 60tev2pev , correspond to a 4.3 @xmath6 excess over reasonable expectations for the background of @xmath7 from atmospheric neutrinos and muons , corresponding to a single - flavor neutrino flux of @xmath8 at pev .",
    "non - detection of higher energy events implies a cutoff or a break above 2pev for a hard spectrum with power - law index of @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , it is also compatible with a slightly softer but unbroken power - law spectrum with index @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the sky distribution of the 28 events is consistent with isotropy @xcite , implying an extragalactic origin , although a fraction of them could come from galactic sources @xcite .",
    "several possible scenarios for the extragalactic origin of these neutrinos have been discussed , including that they are ` cosmogenic ' , arising in @xmath11-collisions between crs and cosmic background photons , or that they are generated within cr sources , either in @xmath11- or @xmath2-collisions between crs and ambient radiation fields or gas respectively @xcite .",
    "a cosmogenic origin for the icecube events is excluded because the predicted pev flux is well below the observed one @xcite .",
    "@xmath11- or @xmath2-collisions inside sources are more promising for generating sufficient flux .",
    "each daughter neutrino typically takes 3 and 5 percent of the parent proton s energy in these two processes respectively @xcite .",
    "thus , to produce a 1pev neutrino , we require a source located at redshift @xmath12 to accelerate protons to @xmath13pev .",
    "this is only an order of magnitude lower than the energy of the  second knee \" ( 4 - 8@xmath14ev ) , where the crs spectral index steepens from -3.1 to -3.3 .",
    "about one to two orders of magnitude higher , the spectral index flattens from -3.3 to -2.7 at the  ankle \" ( @xmath15ev ) .",
    "either of these two spectral features may correspond to the transition energy above which extragalactic crs dominate over galactic crs @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to discuss a possible link between sources of these neutrinos and the sources of crs with energies above the second knee , hereafter simply ultrahigh energy crs ( uhecrs ) in this paper .",
    "note that certain kinds of extragalactic accelerators of protons up to @xmath16100pev may be sufficient to explain the current observations .",
    "however , our interest here is whether a link could exist between the newly - detected neutrinos and uhecrs , since then these neutrinos could shed some light on the still mysterious sources of uhecrs .",
    "we note that the reported flux is quite close to the so - called waxman - bahcall bound @xcite , a benchmark value for the extragalactic neutrino flux based on the uhecr flux , subject to some assumptions @xcite .",
    "alternative constraints on the extragalactic neutrino flux comes from observations of the isotropic background of multi - gev gamma - rays , which is at the level of @xmath17 .",
    "it provides a robust upper limit since the gamma - rays that are unavoidably co - produced must not overwhelm this flux .",
    "if the pev neutrinos and uhecrs indeed originate from the same sources , the neutrino spectrum should extend to @xmath3pev without any abrupt cutoff .",
    "this would not conflict with the current icecube observations if the neutrino spectrum is softer than @xmath18 .",
    "note that the source proton spectrum may not necessarily be soft as the neutrino spectrum , since in some specific scenarios , higher energy protons can have lower production efficiencies of secondary pions , and for @xmath11 processes , the neutrino spectrum also depends on the ambient photon spectrum .",
    "given the likely pion - production origin of the reported neutrinos , an approximate value for the required flux of parent protons @xmath19 that escape the source can be given by @xmath20 @xcite , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the energies of the neutrino and proton respectively , and @xmath23 is the pion - production efficiency via @xmath2- or @xmath11-collisions of the escaping crs .",
    "thus , sources of uhecrs that also account for the sub ",
    "pev / pev neutrinos need to provide a proton flux of @xmath24 in the 10100pev energy range .",
    "this flux corresponds to a local proton energy production rate of @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the speed of light , @xmath27 is the hubble constant , @xmath28 is a factor that accounts for the contribution from high - redshift sources @xcite , and @xmath29 is a factor coming from normalization of the proton spectrum ( e.g. , for power - law index of @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) .",
    "note that accelerated protons contribute to the observed crs only if they can escape from the sources , while pion - production process at the source would remove energy from accelerated protons .",
    "thus the energy production rate of the crs that escape the source can be given by @xmath32 with @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the pion production efficiency of the escaping uhecrs .",
    "for comparison , the required local cr energy production rate is @xmath35 if the transition from galactic to extragalactic crs occurs at the second knee , and @xmath36 if the transition occurs at the ankle for @xmath30 @xcite . given the proton energy production rate for a certain class of source , the pion production effiency needs to be in a certain range in order to simultaneously account for the observed neutrino flux , which in turn can constrain the potential sources .",
    "the rest of this paper is outlined as follows .",
    "first we provide a brief overview of various candidate sources of uhecrs and discuss their potential as pev neutrino sources in section ii",
    ". then we focus on semi - relativistic hypernovae in star - forming galaxies as a possible source class that can simultaneously account for the newly discovered sub - pev / pev neutrinos and uhecrs in section iii . in section iv",
    ", we conclude with a discussion of further aspects concerning the proposed scenario .",
    "considering some selected types of sources that are known to meet the hillas criterion @xcite for acceleration of uhecrs , we indicate in fig .  1 the typical regions that they may occupy on the plane of @xmath37 , the local proton energy production rate , versus @xmath38 , the pion - production efficiency of crs that produce pev neutrinos .",
    "the black solid line represents the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 required to reproduce the observed neutrino flux , with the gray band corresponding to its 1-@xmath6 confidence interval .",
    "the upper and lower dashed curves represent the local energy production rate @xmath39 of escaping crs required to account for the observed uhecrs if the galactic - extragalactic transition occurs at the second knee and at the ankle , respectively , for the case @xmath40 .",
    "the dotted curves are corresponding ones for the case @xmath41 .",
    "different values of @xmath42 will result in different sets of the two curves .",
    "valid sources of uhecrs are expected to be located above the lower curves .",
    "if , in addition , the efficiency of escape of accelerated crs from the source is high , they should lie below the upper curves .",
    "note that @xmath43 has been adopted here .",
    "a larger @xmath44 will shift all the curves upward by the same factor .",
    "if the observed sub - pev / pev neutrinos originate from the sources of uhecrs , the relevant region in the figure should overlap with the gray band .",
    "this implies that for galactic - extragalactic transition at the second knee , the pion production efficiency for escaping crs must be @xmath45 , whereas it the transition is at the ankle , the efficiency must be even higher , i.e. , @xmath46 .     in plotting the various regions in fig .",
    "1 , we have assumed only representative values for each type of source , without indicating the entire parameter space covered by that source class . for all sources , we take a common range of values @xmath47 for the fraction of available energy that is channeled into escaping cr protons",
    ".     jets of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) have long been considered one of the most promising candidates for the sources of uhecrs as well as neutrinos @xcite .",
    "here we consider only powerful objects with kinetic power @xmath48 and source density @xmath49 @xcite , which gives @xmath50 .",
    "the pion production efficiency depends on the location of cr acceleration and neutrino production . in the inner jet regions corresponding to the typical emission zones in blazars within @xmath51 schwarzschild radii of the central black hole",
    ", the large photon density implies a high value , @xmath52 @xcite ( note also @xcite ) . in the outer jet regions such as the hot spots or radio lobes at kpc - mpc scales with much less ambient radiation , accordingly lower values are expected , @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "these sites are respectively denoted ",
    "agn inner jets / cores \" and  agn outer jets \" in fig .  1 .     gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) have also been widely discussed as favorable sources of uhecrs @xcite . adopting an isotropic - equivalent kinetic energy per grb of @xmath54 erg and a local grb rate @xmath55 @xcite , we have @xmath56 .",
    "if cr acceleration occurs in the innermost regions of internal shocks with high photon density , the pion production efficiency could be as high as @xmath52 @xcite , as indicated in fig .  1 as  grb internal shocks \" .",
    "note , however , that the location of internal shocks can span a large range of radii depending on the behavior of the central engine , and if it occurs in the outermost regions closer to the external shock , much smaller values of @xmath38 are also possible .",
    "clusters of galaxies , in particular the accretion shocks surrounding them , have also been proposed as possible uhecr sources @xcite .",
    "although it may be challenging to achieve maximum energies of @xmath57 ev , acceleration up to @xmath58 eev may be quite feasible @xcite .",
    "furthermore , radio galaxies , i.e. agn with jets , are sometimes found in the central regions of clusters , which can also provide uhecrs inside clusters .",
    "such uhecrs can produce high - energy neutrinos via @xmath2 collisions with the gas constituting the intracluster medium ( icm ) @xcite . if we consider massive clusters with @xmath59 , their space density is @xmath60 and their expected accretion luminosity is @xmath61 , so we arrive at @xmath62 , comparable to that of agn . assuming an average density of @xmath63 for the icm gas and a residence time 1 - 10gyr of high - energy protons inside the cluster",
    ", we estimate a pion - production efficiency of @xmath64 , outlined in fig .  1 as  clusters of galaxies \" .",
    "supernova remnants ( snrs ) have been widely discussed as promising accelerators of cr protons ( see @xcite for a review and references therein ) .",
    "however , standard treatments of shock acceleration in snrs with ejecta velocities @xmath65 reveal that it is difficult to reach maximum energy @xmath66pev , not to mention uhe protons with energy @xmath67eev @xcite ( but see @xcite for discussions on acceleration during the very early stage of snrs , and @xcite on snrs expanding into their progenitor winds ) .",
    "however , a subset of very energetic supernovae called semi  relativistic hypernova ( sr - hypernova ) , has ejecta with much faster velocities , @xmath68 , expanding into their progenitors stellar winds @xcite . assuming a cr - amplified magnetic field with a strength close to equipartition , sr - hypernovae",
    "satisfy the hillas condition @xcite for acceleration of @xmath69ev protons and have thus been proposed as sources of uhecrs above the second knee @xcite , or even up to the highest cr energies when considering the fastest part of the ejecta and heavy nuclei acceleration @xcite .",
    "sr - hypernovae are usually found associated with low - luminosity grbs .",
    "although their event rate of @xmath70 is lower than ordinary supernovae , the total kinetic energies released per event is larger , @xmath71 @xcite , providing a proton production rate @xmath72 .",
    "below we estimate that the pion production efficiency for pev neutrinos due to _ pp-_collisions between crs escaping from sr - hypernova remnants and the ambient interstellar medium ( ism ) of their host galaxies is @xmath45 , although this is subject to uncertainties concerning the magnetic field and density of the host ism .",
    "thus , sr - hypernova remnants could be good candidates for the sources of the neutrinos detected by icecube , as marked in fig .  1 . since fig .",
    "1 only describes a necessary condition for the link between icecube neutrinos and uhecrs , in the following sections we investigate in more detail whether a self - consistent model can be constructed that ascribe the newly discovered sub - pev / pev neutrinos to sr - hypernovae remnants , provided that they are also responsible for uhecrs above the second knee .",
    "since both auger and hires indicate a rather light composition of uhecrs around the second knee @xcite , we assume that the source composition of crs below @xmath73eev is predominantly protons and do not consider the effect of heavier nuclei in this paper .",
    "we point out that the marked regions in fig .",
    "1 for each source contain large uncertainties .",
    "more precise values of @xmath74 and @xmath38 depend on the details of the models .",
    "nonetheless , we can obtain a general idea about the plausibility of candidate sources . as shown ,",
    "if a certain type of source can only account for uhecrs above the ankle , an extremely high pion - production efficiency ( i.e. @xmath75 ) is needed to achieve sufficient pev neutrino flux . on the other hand ,",
    "if the pion - production efficiency is too low ( e.g.,@xmath76 ) , reproducing the observed neutrino flux requires a high proton production rate , which in turn implies a low efficiency of cr escape from the sources to be consistent with the observed uhecr flux .",
    "we also note that fig .",
    "1 only gives constraints on some candidates from the viewpoint of the energy budget .",
    "these sources do not necessarily represent the common origins of these neutrinos and uhecrs even if they satisfy these energetics constraints .",
    "note also that some of these sources may already be constrained by other means .",
    "for instance , as indicated in @xcite , if the grb internal shock model is responsible for the pev neutrinos , icecube should probably have already discovered a neutrino  grb association both in time and space during its previous 40- and 59-string search @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray upper limits for some nearby , massive galaxy clusters imply a low energy density of crs at gev - tev energies in their icm @xcite , which constrain their contributions to the diffuse neutrino background at energies somewhat lower than those of the icecube neutrinos . in simplest agn models , @xmath11 collisions would lead to too many events at @xmath58pev energies , which is not favored by the current observation , unless extremely high magnetic field exists in the interaction region @xcite .    in the sr - hypernova remnant model",
    ", the concomitantly produced isotropic gamma - ray flux may pose a potential problem . generally speaking ,",
    "if the diffuse neutrino flux is produced at the level of @xmath77 via _ pp-_collisions , the accompanying gamma - rays may overwhelm the 0.1 - 100gev diffuse isotropic gamma ",
    "ray background observed by fermi / lat @xcite unless the source proton spectrum is sufficiently hard . as indicated in @xcite , @xmath78 may already be in conflict with the gamma - ray background at low energies .",
    "although a hard spectrum of @xmath30 is employed in our calculation , we note that besides the proposed sr - hypernovae remnants , ordinary snrs are expected to provide additional low - energy gamma - ray flux without contributing to sub - pev / pev neutrinos .",
    "thus we must beware that the total diffuse gamma - ray flux generated by sr - hypernova remnants and snrs do not exceed the observed value .",
    "accelerated protons from sr - hypernova remnants will interact with the ism before escaping from their host galaxies and produce neutrinos , gamma rays and electrons / positions .",
    "the energy loss time of cr protons in the ism via @xmath2-collisions is @xmath79^{-1}\\\\ & = 6\\times 10^{7}{\\rm yr}\\,\\left[\\frac{\\sigma_{pp}(\\varepsilon_p={\\rm 60\\,pev})}{100\\,\\rm mb}\\right]^{-1}\\left(\\frac{n}{1\\,\\rm cm^{-3}}\\right)^{-1 } \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the inelasticity , @xmath81 is the cross section , and @xmath82 is the number density of ism protons . the @xmath2-collision efficiency can be estimated by @xmath83 with @xmath84 as the escape timescale . generally , there are two ways for crs to escape from a galaxy . one , diffusive escape , is energy ",
    "dependent and the other , advective escape via a galactic wind , is energy  independent .",
    "the associated escape timescales can be estimated by @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively . here",
    "@xmath87 is the diffusion coefficient where @xmath88 and @xmath89 are normalization factors , and @xmath90 depending on the spectrum of interstellar magnetic turbulence .",
    "@xmath91 is usually taken as the scale height of the galaxy s gaseous disk and @xmath92 is the velocity of the galactic wind in which the crs are advected .",
    "the diffuse gamma - ray emission from the galactic plane implies @xmath93 for tev protons @xcite , so we may expect that @xmath38 for @xmath94pev protons is @xmath95 in our galaxy .",
    "however , since the sr - hypernova rate should generally trace the cosmic star formation rate ( sfr ) , which is known to increase dramatically with @xmath12 from @xmath96 up to at least @xmath9712 @xcite , the properties of galaxies at @xmath9712 ( hereafter ` high - redshift ' galaxies ) are likely to be more important for determining the total diffuse neutrino flux . as our template systems , we consider high - redshift galaxies of two types , normal star - forming galaxies ( nsg ) and starburst galaxies ( sbg ) .",
    "high - redshift galaxies display different properties from nearby ones .",
    "high - redshift nsgs generally do not reveal well - developed disk structure and show more extended morphologies with typical scale height @xmath98kpc for massive systems @xcite .",
    "they also have much higher mass fractions of molecular gas @xcite with typical column density @xmath99g@xmath100 , implying volumetric average ism densities of @xmath101 .",
    "high - redshift sbgs typically have scale height @xmath102pc and average gas density @xmath103 @xcite . as for diffusion coefficients ,",
    "recent studies on cr propagation and anisotropy in our galaxy suggest @xmath104 at 3gev and @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "since little is known about the diffusion coefficient in high-@xmath12 galaxies , we adopt the same values of @xmath88 and @xmath106 as inferred in our galaxy for high  redshift nsgs .",
    "we assume a lower diffusion coefficient @xmath107 for high - redshift sbgs , because the magnetic fields in nearby sbgs such as m82 and ngc253 are observed to be @xmath108 times stronger than in our galaxy and the diffusion coefficient is expected to scale with the cr s larmor radius ( @xmath109 ) @xcite .",
    "regarding advective escape , the velocity of the galactic nuclear wind is @xmath110 @xcite , while optical and x - ray observations show the velocity of the outflow in m82 are @xmath111 @xcite and @xmath112 @xcite respectively . since galactic winds are probably driven by supernova explosions @xcite whose rate is higher in high - redshift galaxies , we may expect their winds to be faster and take @xmath113 and @xmath114 as the reference values for nsgs and sbgs respectively .",

    "independent advective escape dominates over energy - dependent diffusive escape , so the spectrum of neutrinos roughly follows the @xmath167 accelerated proton spectrum . as the energy increases , the neutrino spectrum breaks",
    "because diffusive escape becomes faster than advective escape . because @xmath168 , the spectral index above the break increases by about 0.3 .",
    "but the increase of the @xmath2 cross section at higher energies @xcite compensates this somewhat , making the final spectral slope close to -2.2 . note that in this case the uhecrs are mostly produced by sr - hypernovae in nsgs while the pev neutrinos mainly arise from sr - hypernovae in sbgs .",
    "this is because most sr - hypernovae occur in nsgs while the @xmath2-collision efficiency is much higher in sbgs .",

    "if the observed sub - pev / pev neutrinos originate from the sources of uhecrs , their spectrum should extend to @xmath3pev without an abrupt cutoff . in our model ,",
    "the spectrum becomes softer at @xmath173pev , since the energy of the corresponding parent proton is @xmath174eev , approaching our assumed maximum energy of @xmath124eev .",
    "this softening would not occur if @xmath175 can be higher .",
    "unless the propagation mode of crs changes from diffusive to rectilinear above @xmath16eev and leads to a lower pion - production efficiency , our model predicts a flux of a few times @xmath176 around 10pev , as long as we assume the observed neutrinos and crs above the second knee share a common origin .",
    "this flux is consistent with the present non - detection of neutrinos above several pev , but is likely to be detectable in the future . given that the all  flavor exposure of icecube is @xmath177 at @xmath178pev @xcite for 662days , we may expect that such a flux of @xmath3pev neutrinos would be detected in @xmath179yrs operation .",
    "including the cascade component , the total diffuse gamma ray flux at @xmath166gev is @xmath180 in both cases , as shown with the solid blue lines in fig .  2 .",
    "note that putative additional losses due to absorption of vhe photons by the radiation fields inside their host galaxies @xcite and by synchrotron losses of the @xmath181 pairs in the host galaxy magnetic fields would lower the predicted cascade flux .",
    "the resulting flux is @xmath182 of the flux observed by lat .",
    "also note that although normal snrs should not contribute to the @xmath58100 tev neutrino flux , they can accelerate protons to pev and produce @xmath183tev gamma rays , contributing to the diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "compared to normal supernovae , the local event rate of sr - hypernovae is @xmath184 while their explosion energy is dozens of times larger , so the integral energy production rate of supernovae may be a few times larger than that of sr - hypernovae .",
    "but the rate of sr - hypernovae relative to supernovae might be higher at high redshifts , as sr - hypernovae may be engine - driven like long grbs @xcite , which seem to occur preferentially in low - metallicity galaxies@xcite .",
    "this would suggest a relatively smaller contribution of normal snrs at higher @xmath12 .",
    "nevertheless , as a rough estimate , we may expect that normal snrs could produce a gamma - ray flux comparable to ( or even less than ) that of sr - hypernova remnants , and in the former case the total gamma - ray flux at 10100gev could reach the level of the observed one , providing a possible explanation for the apparent hardening in the spectrum of the diffusive isotropic gamma - ray background at @xmath185gev . on the other hand , we should also bear in mind that if the normal snrs energy budget turns out to be higher than that of sr - hypernovae even at high redshifts , the total generated diffusive gamma - ray flux would be a serious problem for this model .    as mentioned above ,",
    "the spectral index of the high energy neutrino flux depends on the spectral indices of the injected protons and that of interstellar magnetic turbulence , i.e. , @xmath186 where @xmath187 describes from the increase of the @xmath2 cross section at high energy .",
    "since the current measurement of the neutrino spectrum is far from accurate , if further observations show a different spectral shape , the values of @xmath188 or @xmath106 must be adjusted correspondingly .",
    "the most restrictive constraint on these two parameters comes from the concomitantly produced @xmath166gev gamma - ray flux in the pion - production process : this should not exceed the isotropic gamma - ray background observed by fermi / lat .",
    "adopting either a larger @xmath188 or a larger @xmath106 would lead to a higher low - energy gamma - ray flux ( see the appendix for a detailed calculation ) .",
    "if future observations reveal a much softer neutrino spectrum , our model faces difficulties without invoking some untypical parameters or further refinements , e.g. , introducing a break in the source spectrum .",
    "if sr - hypernovae are responsible not only for crs above the second knee but also for those at the highest energies , one may ask whether any of the neutrino events that have already been observed by icecube can be associated with individual sources within the gzk horizon of 100 mpc @xcite . according to our adopted evolution function @xmath149 and",
    "assuming an isotropic sky distribution for such sources , only about 0.3 out of the total of 28 events can be expected to come from within 100 mpc . in case",
    "such nearby sources happened to coincide with the direction of maximum effective area for icecube , then they may be responsible for about one of the 28 events .",
    "the local sfr density is estimated to be @xmath189 , and employing the relation between sfr and infrared luminosity of a galaxy @xmath190=1.7\\times 10^{-10 } l_{\\rm ir } [ l_\\odot ] $ ] @xcite , we find that a galaxy s cr luminosity , accommodated by hypernovae , is @xmath191 .",
    "given the infrared luminosity of our galaxy is @xmath192 and assuming a @xmath193collision efficiency of @xmath194 , we estimate the total galactic neutrino luminosity at @xmath195tev-1pev is @xmath196 .",
    "note that our galaxy might be too metal rich to host semi - relativistic hypernovae ( or long grbs ) for the last several billion years @xcite , so the real value could be smaller .",
    "even if all these neutrinos are produced in the galactic center and radiate isotropically , it would result in @xmath197 event detection during 662days operation within a @xmath198 circular region around the galactic center @xcite and would not cause a strong anisotropy that violates the observations @xcite .    to summarize ,",
    "we studied whether the newly - detected sub - pev / pev neutrinos can originate from the same sources as those responsible for crs with energies above the second knee .",
    "we discussed the conditions necessary for such a link between the observed pev neutrinos and eev crs , and took sr - hypernova remnants in star - forming galaxies as an example of a self - consistent model that can provide the neutrino - uhecr link .",
    "comparing the predictions of different models , the generated neutrino spectrum may vary somewhat from model to model , and even within the same model depending on the uncertain parameters .",
    "thus , based on the spectral information alone , sr - hypernova remnants can be neither confirmed nor refuted as the true sources of the observed neutrinos .",
    "however , as long as the link between the observed neutrinos and eev crs exists , we may generally expect detection of @xmath3pev neutrinos in the near future .",
    "if such a link could be recognized , the detected neutrino flux and spectral shape should proffer information on the pion - production process at the sources .",
    "we shall then know that the real sources , whatever their identity , have a similar pion - production efficiency as that claimed for sr - hypernova remnants here , given that they also explain the uhecrs above the second knee .",
    "this provides us a chance to study the environment of the sources .",
    "future observations with greater statistics over the current neutrino energy range or detection at higher energies can give further constraints and help to uncover the true identity of the currently mysterious sources of eev crs .",
    "we thank the anonymous referees for useful comments , luis anchordoqui , kohta murase and walter winter for helpful discussions .",
    "this work is supported by the 973 program under grant 2014cb845800 , the nsfc under grants 11273016 and 11033002 , and the excellent youth foundation of jiangsu province ( bk2012011 ) .",
    "in the @xmath2-collision process , neutrinos and neutral pions @xmath199 are produced as well as charged pions @xmath200 , with branching ratios @xmath201 .",
    "@xmath199 decays into two gamma rays , and each takes @xmath202 of the energy of the parent proton .",
    "an approximate relation between the gamma - ray and neutrino flux from the same parent protons can be written as @xmath203 on the other hand , the relation between the neutrino flux at two different energies is @xmath204(\\varepsilon_{\\nu,2}/\\varepsilon_{\\nu,1})^{2-s } \\varepsilon_\\nu^2\\phi_\\nu(\\varepsilon_{\\nu,1})\\ ] ] thus the gamma - ray flux at low energy , e.g. , 10gev , can be related to the neutrino flux at 1pev as @xmath205 for @xmath206 , and @xmath207 for @xmath208 .",
    "the factor @xmath209 is the ratio between the energies of parent protons of 1pev neutrinos and 10gev photons , while the factor @xmath210 comes from substituting the value of the proton maximum energy @xmath211pev into the expression for the diffusion coefficient @xmath212 .",
    "here we have already taken @xmath213 for simplicity . assuming the cascade of vhe gamma rays during propagation will double the gev gamma - ray flux , we need @xmath214 , i.e. , @xmath215 \\end{split}\\ ] ] for @xmath206 , and @xmath216 \\end{split}\\ ] ] for @xmath208 respectively , where @xmath217 and @xmath218 .",
    "@xmath219 here is the diffusion escape time for the parent proton of a pev neutrino .",
    "@xmath220 is usually true if typically expected values of @xmath88 , @xmath92 , @xmath91 , @xmath82 are employed .",
    "note that as we adjust the value of @xmath221 and @xmath106 , these parameters also need to be changed in order to meet eq .",
    "( [ sdelta1 ] ) and ( [ sdelta2 ] ) .",
    "if future observations reveal a much softer neutrino spectrum , the changes in these parameters could be significant and some extreme values might be required . on the other hand , significant changes in these parameters",
    "could lead to @xmath222 . in this case , the pion - production efficiency would hardly depend on the energy and directly implies @xmath223 .",
    "this would contradict the observed neutrino spectrum , and hence our model would require further modifications , such as introducing a break in the source spectrum .",
