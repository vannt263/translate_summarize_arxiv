    "concludes our paper .",
    "in our paper , we consider a single cellular network with @xmath0 number of users and a base station .",
    "the allocated rate by the base station is to the @xmath1 ues and is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 .",
    "the ues are represented by utility functions @xmath4 .",
    "ues utility functions differ as the ue run different applications .",
    "we assume that some of the ues have utility functions that are strictly concave ( logarithmic utility functions ) , while others have convex utility functions ( sigmoidal - like utility functions ) .",
    "our objective is to distribute the resources , at the base station , optimally among ues .",
    "the utility functions are characterized as follows :    * @xmath5 * @xmath6    in our paper , we use sigmoidal - like utility functions to represent ues , as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the sigmoidal - like utility functions satisfy @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "in addition , we use logarithmic utility functions to represent time - tolerant applications . as in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we can express the logarithmic utility functions as below : @xmath12 where @xmath13 represents a user utility function that is equal to 100% , and @xmath14 represents the increase in the rate @xmath2 in the utility percentage .",
    "logarithmic utility functions satisfy the condition @xmath10 and @xmath15 .",
    "our utility proportional fairness function , as in @xcite , is given by @xmath16 where @xmath0 is the number of users , and @xmath17 equals the rate of the users from 1 to @xmath0 .",
    "the objective of our utility proportional fairness function is to maximize the utility functions of all the ues within the system . in the mean time",
    ", it insures proportional fairness among ues utility functions .",
    "in addition , our utility proportional fairness function prioritizes the users with real - time applications ( or sigmoidal - like utility functions ) while guaranteeing a minimum qos for all the subscribers .",
    "our main objectives are maximizing system utility and fair allocation of the resources among the users .",
    "therefore , the optimization equation will be written as in @xcite : @xmath18 the optimization problem is a convex optimization problem and there is a tractable global optimal solution as in @xcite .",
    "interest in multi - stage resource allocation optimization algorithms has widely increased after proving its effectiveness in solving the optimization problem in the wireless and wired networks .",
    "our distributed optimization algorithm , which described in , is a modified version of the resource allocation optimization algorithm in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the auction - based optimization algorithm is divided into two algorithms , at base station and ues .",
    "* resource allocation optimization algorithm at base station : + first of all , the base station receives bids from the ues at time @xmath19 and then replaces the old bids at time @xmath20 , while storing the old bids in the base station local memory .",
    "the base station compares the received bids @xmath21 with @xmath22 . in case @xmath23 ( pre - specified threshold ) ,",
    "the base station calculates the optimal rates @xmath24 and send them to the ues ; otherwise , the base station computes a new shadow price @xmath25 and communicates it to all the ues . *",
    "resource allocation optimization algorithm at the ues : + from time to time , the users receive new shadow price @xmath26 . ues update and replace the new @xmath26 and store the old shadow price , @xmath27 .",
    "the ues calculate the optimal rate , based on the newly received @xmath26 , and then solve the optimization problem @xmath28 that subjects to the condition @xmath29 , to insure that all subscribers receive a minimum qos .",
    "the optimization problem , is solved by using bisection method and convex optimization techniques .",
    "the rate @xmath30 is used to calculate the new bid @xmath31 that will be sent to the base station .",
    "this process is repeated , yet the value of @xmath32 , at the base station , is less than the pre - specified threshold value ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "it is a serious challenge to maintain a constant quality of service , when user demand and available resources dynamically change .",
    "maintaining quality service requires an appropriate allocation of resources .",
    "adaptive real - time applications , like video and voice applications , usually require higher rates than delay - tolerant applications . in order to maintain high quality service ,",
    "sufficient resources need to be allocated to the adaptive real - time applications .",
    "allocation of resources needs to adapt to the changes in the application rates . in different adaptive real - time applications , such as video - conferencing and voip ,",
    "the major effect on the bit - rate variations is a combination of the activity of the picture , and the picture coding method @xcite . in the case of video streaming",
    ", the motion of the objects , in the video , leads to variations in the bit - rate , which increases as the movement of the objects increase . long period of no motion or few movements of small objects may result in a low bit - rate increase @xcite . in the past , many efforts aimed to reduce the variations in the bit - rate by means of buffering , as in @xcite .",
    "this increase or decrease of the bit - rate is not constant , but is dynamic and continuous .",
    "the change in the quality of video streaming due to the variations in rate affect the quality of experience ( qoe ) of the viewers , which eventually impacts customer satisfaction @xcite . in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , the authors represent adaptive real - time application in a fixed - rate form , meaning the rate of applications does not change with time , which would never occur in reality .",
    "our distributed algorithm considers the fluctuations of rates in the adaptive real - time applications .",
    "assigning random distribution to the application utility functions means that the utility functions of applications continuously and randomly change with time to realistically represent the application rates .",
    "random distributions are used to represent the randomness of variables within a certain range . in our paper , we assign two different distribution functions , normal and triangular , as shown in , to represent the continuous change in the sigmoidal - like utility functions , and then we compare the optimal rates in each case with fixed - rate applications .",
    "normal distribution is a common representation of the random variables as the distribution is unknown .",
    "normal distribution states the fact that approximately 97% of the random variables are within @xmath343 standard deviations from the mean , where @xmath35 represents mean , and @xmath36 represents standard deviation .      in the case of triangular distribution",
    ", the values continuously and randomly vary within the @xmath37 and @xmath38 limits .",
    "the most - likely value is represented as @xmath39 .",
    "the applications at the @xmath39 rate will work effectively .",
    "the @xmath37 is the minimum point where below this point the application will not function as required or stop .",
    "for example , in video applications , the video transfer stops and the image disappear .",
    "the @xmath38 is the maximum rate at which the application runs with the highest quality .",
    "the triangular distribution can be a good representative of a real - life situation when the minimum , maximum and most - likely values can be estimated .",
    "we use arena simulation software interfaces with microsoft visual basic for applications to solve the algorithms in equation ( [ eqn : sigmoidal ] ) and ( [ eqn : log ] ) for different logarithmic and sigmoidal - like utility functions . in our simulation",
    ", we consider one cellular network unit with six utility functions , to represent six ues .",
    "three sigmodial - like utility functions corresponding to three adaptive real - time applications . on the other hand , three logarithmic utility functions corresponding to three delay - tolerant applications .",
    "our simulation results show convergence to the optimal solution . in the following simulations",
    ", the adaptive real - time applications will have the priority over the delay - time applications in the process of rate allocation .",
    "we set the total rate @xmath40=100 and number of iterations @xmath41=20 .",
    "we use three logarithmic functions that are expresses in equation ( [ eqn : log ] ) to represent three of the total six users .",
    "different parameters ( @xmath14 ) have been assigned to each of the three logarithmic users to approximately represent delay - tolerant applications ( e.g. ftp ) .",
    "we use @xmath42 for users 1,2 , and 3 respectively .",
    "we use three normalized sigmoidal - like functions that expressed by equation ( [ eqn : sigmoidal ] ) to represent three real - time applications .",

    "shows the bidding process of the users with number of iterations ( @xmath41 ) . as the user bids increase ,",
    "the higher the rate allocated . since the rate allocation priority is given to the sigmoidal - like utility functions , the adaptive real - time applications will be given the priority of bidding and allocation of the resources , yet they reach the inflection point ( @xmath45 ) and the remaining resources will be shared among delay - tolerant applications based on their utility parameters ( @xmath14 ) .",
