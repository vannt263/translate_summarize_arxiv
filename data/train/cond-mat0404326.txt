    "formation of bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) in dilute gases @xcite has created a new field of nonlinear physics with new specific problems . among new features of bec in gases",
    "are the spatial inhomogeneity created by the confining potential , interplay of coherent and nonlinear phenomena , multi - species condensation , etc .",
    "many of such new problems have already been addressed in current literature . in particular ,",
    "the condensate oscillations near the center of the trap and its free expansion after switching off the trap potential was considered in refs .",
    "creation of strongly elongated ( `` cigar - shaped '' ) traps has made possible to generate dark @xcite and bright @xcite solitons in bec .",
    "however , theoretical description of the solitons proves to be not a simple problem .",
    "indeed , the standard reduction of the gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation to the one - dimensional ( 1d ) nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation is justified only under the condition that axial size of the solution ( along the trap axis ) is much greater than its radial size . however , the actual solitons observed in experiment @xcite have comparable axial and radial sizes .",
    "an attempt to go beyond the nls approximation was made in ref .",
    "@xcite under the assumption that variation of the field variables in the axial direction takes place on much longer scale than that in the radial direction . therefore the equation with a `` non - polynomial interaction '' obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite describes the ground state of bec with repulsive interaction when the above assumption is correct but its application to `` short '' dark or bright solitons is not well justified .    in this paper",
    "we consider dynamics of bec in the cigar - shaped trap by means of variational approach without assumption that the field variables change slowly along the trap axis .",
    "the radial distribution of bec density and its radial velocity are approximated by real and imaginary gaussian functions , respectively , with parameters depending on the axial coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "this approach allows us to reduce the three - dimensional ( 3d ) bec lagrangian to an effective 1d one which depends on the axial wave function @xmath1 , the mean condensate radius @xmath2 , and the radial velocity potential @xmath3 . the resulting system of equations for the above three variables , though being rather complicated , has an advantage of dependence on only one spatial coordinate @xmath0 .",
    "it contains as limiting cases the nls and the `` non - polynomial interaction '' approximations .",
    "the derived effective system allows one to investigate bright and dark solitons in a wide domain of their existence .",
    "in particular , the bright solitons can be considered right up to the collapse instability threshold .",
    "we also study the linear waves propagating along the condensate with repulsive interaction between the atoms .",
    "there are two types of waves : the low frequency sound waves and the high frequency radial compression wave .",
    "the dispersion relations for the linear waves , applicable to the high density bec , are obtained in the long wavelength limit . in the next approximation of `` small but finite '' amplitude of the ground state perturbation we obtain the korteweg - de vries ( kdv ) equation for weakly dispersive and nonlinear waves propagating along the condensate .",
    "an interesting feature of this equation is that in a high density bec the coefficient in the dispersion term changes sign .",
    "an immediate consequence is that fast solitons of small amplitude , propagating in a repulsive bec , are bright rather than dark , contrary to what is usually assumed by analogy between the gp and 1d nls equations .",
    "the starting point for our consideration is the gp equation for the wave function @xmath4 of the condensate , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the radial coordinate , @xmath7 is the effective nonlinear coupling constant , @xmath8 denotes the @xmath9-wave scattering length , @xmath10 is the atomic mass , @xmath11 is the frequency of atomic oscillations in the radial direction , and @xmath12 is the trap potential in the axial direction of a cigar - shaped trap .",

    ", the condensate wave function @xmath4 can be factorized as @xmath21 its substitution into ( [ action3d ] ) , ( [ lagr3d ] ) and integration over radial coordinate yield an effective 1d lagrangian and the corresponding lagrange equation for @xmath1 is eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . here",
    "we want to generalize this procedure to the case when @xmath22 and the radial motion of the condensate must be taken into account .    assuming quasi-1d geometry , we approximate the wave function as @xmath23 here @xmath2 characterizes the local radius of the condensate and @xmath24 gives the local radial velocity .",

    "( [ 79 ] ) is the fact that the dispersion term changes sign at @xmath189 while the coefficient at the nonlinear term is always negative .",
    "this means that the small amplitude solitons propagating on a constant background in repulsive bec are dark only in the region @xmath190 but become bright in the region @xmath191 .",
    "obviously , such behavior is explained physically by competition of two mechanisms of energy changes due to presence of the wave ",
    "one is caused by the change of the potential energy of the gas in the transverse trap and another one is related with the nonlinear energy of interatomic gas interaction .",
