    "the dynamics of filaments are a key issue for the print quality in inkjet printing @xcite , where elongated liquid filaments are ejected from the nozzle . for optimal print quality",

    "therefore we study the details of the dynamics of these filaments .    depending on the viscosity , size and shape of the filament",
    ", it may collapse into a single droplet , or it may break up into multiple smaller droplets @xcite . a filament collapse resulting in a single droplet",
    "is called stable .",
    "a filament collapse into multiple droplets is called unstable .",
    "the stability of the filament influences the number of droplets and their size distribution , after the collapse of the filament .",
    "since filaments are essentially finite liquid jets , the stability of liquid jets is relevant here .",
    "the earliest reported observations of the stability of liquid jets were done by savart in 1833 , who observed that a continuous liquid jet breaks up into distinct droplets @xcite .",
    "plateau reported that a varicose perturbation of the liquid jet is unstable , if the wavelength of the perturbation is larger then the circumference of the jet @xcite . in 1878 , lord rayleigh derived the dispersion relation for an infinite jet with a small periodical perturbation @xcite .",
    "the classical rayleigh - plateau instability assumes a sinusoidal perturbation with a time dependent amplitude @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the axial position on the cylinder , and @xmath2 is the dimensionless wavenumber of the varicose perturbation on the surface of the cylinder .",
    "the wavenumber is nondimensionalized by the relevant length scale of the problem , namely the unperturbed radius of the cylinder , @xmath3 : @xmath4 . in this linear approximation , the amplitude of the perturbation @xmath5 grows exponentially with time , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the growth rate of the perturbation amplitude , and @xmath8 is the amplitude of the perturbation at @xmath9 .",
    "in the inviscid theory by rayleigh , @xmath7 is inversely proportional to the capillary time @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are respectively the density and surface tension of the liquid .",
    "weber derived the disperion relation for the rayleigh - plateau instability including the influence of viscosity @xcite .",
    "the relevant dimensionless group for the dynamics of the viscous rayleigh - plateau instability on an infinite cylinder is the ohnesorge number @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the dynamic viscosity .",
    "the ohnesorge number is the ratio of the viscous timescale over the capillary time scale .",

    "the stability of liquid filaments became possible . using a numerical model , schulkes found that above a certain @xmath31 , the filament collapse is always stable  @xcite .",
    "later notz & basaran refined this result by showing that the stability of the filament collapse depends on both @xmath31 and the aspect ratio @xmath32 of the filament  @xcite , where @xmath33 is the length of the filament .",
    "so - called end pinching , first observed by stone @xcite , is the cause of the breakup in both studies .    in a recent experimental study , castrjon - pita _",
    "et  al . _",
    "@xcite validated the numerical results by notz & basaran @xcite in the regime of @xmath34 , where end pinching is the dominant breakup mechanism .",
    "the experiments however showed unstable filaments up to @xmath35 . in the regime of long viscous filaments ,",
    "the breakup occurs simultaneously along the entire axis of the jet , which is characteristic for the rayleigh - plateau instability on an infinite jet ( figure [ fig : example_filament ] ) . in the existing numerical studies on the collapse of the finite liquid filament @xcite ,",

    "the critical aspect ratio @xmath38 is defined as the aspect ratio above which the filament collapses due to the rayleigh - plateau instability .",
    "this aspect ratio is found by comparing the breakup time due to the rayleigh - plateau instability with the time that the filament needs to merge into a spherical droplet .",
    "the analysis of the collapse of the liquid filament starts at @xmath29 , when the filament pinches off from another body of liquid at both sides . the filament contracts due to the surface tension .",
    "as the filament contracts , bulges will form at the end of the filament .",
    "these bulges are called tail droplets .",
    "the fluid that has not yet been entrained by the tail droplets remains stationary . for low to moderate viscosities ,",
    "the typical velocity of these tail droplets can be found from balancing the momentum flux into the tail droplet with the capillary forces act on it .",
    "this typical velocity is called the capillary velocity , @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "when the collapse of the filament is stable , the tail droplets move towards the center of mass , where they merge into one droplet .",
    "the distance that the tips of the jets have to travel is given by half the length of the filament minus the diameter of the tail droplet @xmath45 at the moment of merging .",
    "the minimal time for the tail droplets to merge is called the merge time @xmath46 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the radius of the tail droplets at the merge time @xmath46 . at that time , each of the two tail droplets has accumulated half of the initial volume of the liquid filament .",
    "this results in the tail droplet radius @xmath49 in the calculation of @xmath48 the filament is considered as a circular cylinder of length @xmath50 . the merge time @xmath46 is rewritten as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath51 , using equation ( [ eq : tmerge1 ] ) , ( [ eq : radiusd ] ) , and @xmath52 : @xmath53,\\ ] ] this shows that @xmath46 is nearly proportional to @xmath36 , with a small correction since the tail droplets have a finite radius .",
    "the rayleigh - plateau instability causes a filament to break up when @xmath54 .",
    "when @xmath55 , a slightly longer or less viscous filament would collapse into two or more droplets , rendering the collapse unstable . from this balance , the critical aspect ratio @xmath38 can be found .",
    "an expression for the critical aspect ratio @xmath38 as a function of @xmath56 and @xmath39 is found by balancing equations ( [ eq : tbreak ] ) and ( [ eq : tmerge ] ) , putting @xmath57 . @xmath58 in fig .",

    "stability of low viscous filaments has been studied numerically by notz & basaran @xcite , dashed line .",
    "the experimental results by @xcite are shown ( circles for unstable , disks for stable regime ) .",
    "linear theory correctly predicts the critical aspect ratio for filaments of @xmath60 . ]",
    "when the viscosity dominates , the filament contraction is stable .",
    "eggers & fontelos showed that isolated inertialess droplets can not break up @xcite . in the absence of inertia",
    ", the rayleigh - plateau instability no longer causes the filament to break up . since the presented theory uses the rayleigh - plateau instability to find @xmath38 , it is of interest to find the upper viscous limit where the filament can still break up .",
    "an analogy with the capillary contraction of a liquid filament is the capillary contraction of a liquid sheet @xcite . during the contraction , a liquid rim forms at the edge of the sheet , analogue to the tail droplet that forms in the contraction of a liquid jet .",
    "brenner & gueyffier showed that the spatial extend of this rim can be estimated with the stokes length , @xmath61 @xcite . when @xmath62 is larger than the length of the sheet , the rim does not form and the sheet contracts homogeneously .",
    "we expect that the axial extend of the tail droplets on the viscous filaments is also the stokes length .",
    "viscosity dominates the contraction of a viscous filament when the stokes length is larger than half the filament length , since the filament has two ends .",
    "the ratio between the stokes length and half the length of the filament can be written as the length - based ohnesorge number , @xmath63 , with @xmath64 where the first factor on the right - hand side is the stokes length . when @xmath65 , the stokes length is much smaller than the length of the filament ; this means that the influence of the axial extend of the tail droplet on the stability of the filament is negligible .",
    "the highest value of @xmath66 in the unstable region in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] is 0.03 , which shows that the stabilizing effect found by @xcite is not significant in this part of the phase space .",
    "we use a numerical model to validate the presented linear theory . equation ( [ eq : tmerge ] ) shows that for large @xmath36 , the merging occurs after many @xmath51 , which is the timescale of the growth of perturbations .",
    "even very small perturbations may cause a breakup before @xmath67 in the case of long filaments .",
    "the visualization of the small initial perturbation demands a very high optical resolution .",
    "dedicated experimental setups have been built to measure the initial perturbation amplitude of a stimulated rayleigh - plateau instability , such as @xcite .",
    "since the rayleigh - plateau instability on the long viscous filaments grows from noise , the breakup events are different for all filaments . as a result",
    ", this phenomenon can not be observed stroboscopically . in a numerical model on the other hand",
    ", the initial perturbation can be chosen with great precision",
    ". therefore we use a numerical model to validate the linear theory .",
    "the stability of an axisymmetric viscous liquid filament is modeled using the slender jet approximation @xcite . for this study",
    "we use the previously developed numerical model by driessen & jeurissen @xcite . in this model",
    "the singularities that occur at pinchoff and coalescence , are regularized below a radius that scales with the grid resolution ; the influence of the regularization vanishes in the limit of vanishing spatial step size . for this research ,",
    "this cut - off radius is set at @xmath68 .",
    "the initial condition of the calculation is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ic ] .",
    "the grid is moving along with the center of mass of the filament .",
    "the filament is considered to be axisymmetric and initially at rest .",
    "the perturbation is applied both on the radius and the axial velocity of the jet , using the linearized solution of the rayleigh - plateau instability @xcite , @xmath69 the radial perturbation is symmetric in the origin , whereas the velocity fluctuation is anti - symmetric .",
    "the parameter scan is performed on the regime where the rayleigh - plateau instability is expected to dominate the breakup , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "the value for @xmath39 is 0.01 .",
    "this value has been chosen such that the result of the linear stability analysis matches with the stability results of the experimental data . due to the experimental restrictions",
    "it is not possible to retrieve the values for @xmath39 for every separate experiment .     and @xmath72 .",
    "the time between the consecutive contours is @xmath51 . ]",
    "each filament is simulated from @xmath29 to @xmath67 . at the latter time , the tail droplets have merged in case of stable contraction . when the filament has broken up at any point in time before the end of the simulation , it is called unstable .",
    "the transition between the stable and unstable regime is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] . with the results of the numerical model",
    ", it is shown that the stability of a viscous filament can indeed be predicted with linear theory , for a given @xmath39 .",
    "there are slight differences between the numerical results and the linear theory . here",
    "we explain these deviations qualitatively . at high viscosity , the numerical results are more stable than the linear theory .",
    "we hypothesize that this is due to the influence of the tail droplets on the liquid thread through viscosity .",
    "the linear theory assumes that the tail droplets are spherical when they merge . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : numericalexamples ] , this assumption is inaccurate for high viscous threads .",
    "the viscous dissipation that occurs in the tail droplet at low viscosity is smeared out over a larger region of the filament at high viscosity @xcite .",
    "when these regions overlap , they stabilize the merging . for low viscosity , the numerical model gives a less stable filament , since the capillary waves emitted by the tail droplets destabilize the merging @xcite .",
    "these capillary waves are not included in the linear theory .    according to @xcite ,",
    "one expects that the filament remains stable when @xmath73 , since end pinching does not occur in that region .",
    "this , however , does not mean that a filament with @xmath74 is intrinsically stable .",
    "a high viscous filament might break up due to the rayleigh - plateau instability , as we show here by the linear theory and the numerical model .",
    "as the initial noise amplitude has not been measured directly , @xmath8 can only be found indirectly from @xmath26 .",
    "it is assumed to be the same for all experiments . to remove this limitation of the analysis",
    ", the noise amplitude must be studied with a dedicated setup . at low viscosities , @xmath75 ,",
    "the pinchoff resembles the shape of a double cone , in which one side bends back over the other with an internal angle larger than @xmath76 @xcite .",
    "this geometry can not be described in the slender jet approximation , which requires the radius to be a single valued function of the axial position . however , resolving this complicated geometry is not necessary to show that the stability of long viscous filaments is determined by @xmath36 , @xmath31 and @xmath39 , which was the objective of this paper .",
    "a liquid filament either merges into a single droplet , or breaks up into multiple droplets .",
    "breakup occurs if the aspect ratio @xmath36 is larger than a critical value , which depends on the ohnesorge number @xmath31 and the relative perturbation amplitude @xmath39 .",
    "we provide a theoretical explanation of the filament stability in the regime of long viscous filaments , based on the rayleigh - plateau instability . at low viscosity , @xmath77 ,",
