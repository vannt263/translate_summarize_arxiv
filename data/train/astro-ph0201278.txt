    "one of the major results of the iras survey was the discovery of a class of extremely luminous galaxies ( l@xmath310@xmath4l@xmath2 ) which emit most of their energy in the far - infrared @xcite .",
    "these ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) have been intensely studied over the past 15 years leading to significant progress in our understanding of their properties ( see review of * ? ? ?",
    "for example , it is now clearly established that most , if not all , ulirgs are interacting systems ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) , with ample quantities of molecular gas and dust surrounding their active central regions @xcite .",
    "it appears likely that the mergers caused the inordinate far - infrared luminosities , either by compressing the natal ism and triggering a global starburst , or by triggering accretion onto a central super massive black hole forming an agn @xcite .",
    "it is not clear , however , which mechanism dominates . this is because massive star formation is always expected near the central potential well of ulirgs , but the spatial resolution at mid- to far - infrared wavelengths , where most of the energy of those galaxies appears , is rather poor . for example , for arp220 , the prototypical ulirg ,",
    "its two putative nuclei are separated by @xmath5 , and most of the molecular gas is well within the central 10@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the peak of the far - infrared spectral energy distribution for arp 220 though lies near 60@xmath0 m where the spatial resolution available from iras and iso is greater than 30@xmath6  insufficient to resolve the locations of the heating source(s ) .",
    "consequently we rely on less direct diagnostics , usually in the near and mid - infrared , to address the questions of the origins of the far - infrared luminosity @xcite .",
    "this approach has proven to be extremely powerful and has produced many surprises .",
    "one prime example was the mid - infrared imaging of the antennae galaxies ( ngc4038/39 ) with the infrared space observatory which revealed that 15% of its energy at 15@xmath0 m originated from a star cluster inconspicuous in the optical and near - infrared @xcite .",
    "however , while observations in the mid - infrared can much better probe the dusty cores of ir bright galaxies than visible observations , the cores can still be extincted in the mid - infrared .",
    "furthermore , only a small fraction ( @xmath7% ) of the total luminosity of luminous infrared galaxies emerges in the mid - infrared @xcite , so that we are still not directly probing the regions where the far - infrared flux originates15% of the luminosity is emitted between 520@xmath0 m @xcite ] .",
    "arp299(=mrk171 , vv118 , ic694+ngc3690 ) , at a distance of 41mpc , ( v@xmath8 = 3080kms@xmath9 , h@xmath10=75kms@xmath9mpc@xmath9 ) , is a relatively nearby peculiar galaxy .",
    "the system is dynamically young , its components still violently interacting leading to the formation of an 180kpc ( 13@xmath11 ) long tidal tail @xcite .",
    "diffuse emission around the central regions extends over an area 1.5@xmath11 in size , while the galaxy itself consists of ic694(=mrk171b = ugc6472 = vv118a ) to the east and ngc3690(=mrk171a = ugc6471 = vv118b ) nearly 20@xmath6 to the west ( see figure  [ image]a ) .",
    "following the nomenclature of @xcite and @xcite , the nucleus of ic694 is often called source a. ngc3690 is resolved to sources b1 and b2 to the south , with b2 marking the position of its nucleus , and sources c and c@xmath11 located @xmath12 to the north of b2 .",
    "it is believed that arp299 results from a prograde - retrograde encounter between a gas rich sab - sb galaxy ( ic694 ) and an sbc - sc galaxy ( ngc3690 ) that occured 750myrs ago , and that the system will merge in 2060myrs @xcite .",
    "sources c and c@xmath11 do not seem to have significant potential wells to be considered individual galaxies given the lack of evidence for an underlying concentration of old , red stars ( i.e. * ? ? ?",

    "recent high resolution imaging has revealed that the morphology of ngc3690 , which is brighter than ic694 in the optical and near infrared , is quite complex @xcite . even though there is no compelling evidence for an active galactic nucleus ( agn ) anywhere in the system ( i.e. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) it is clear that the extinction due to dust is high , considerably changing the apparent morphology of the galaxy as one observes it from the uv and optical to near- and mid - infrared wavelengths @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we will focus our attention on ic694 . while this component appears quite diffuse in the uv and optical ,",
    "its bulge becomes obvious as a point source only at near - infrared @xcite .",
    "the description of our observations is presented in section 2 , the implications of our findings to the current understanding of arp299 are discussed in section 3 , and finally our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "[ sec : obs ]    continuum images of arp299 at 37.7@xmath0 m were obtained on 28 february , 1994 , using the kuiper widefield infrared camera ( kwic , see * ? ? ?",
    "kwic is an imaging spectrometer / spectrophotometer designed for use between 18 and 40@xmath0 m on the kuiper airborne observatory ( kao ) .",
    "kwic employs a 128@xmath14128 element si : sb bib detector with a 2.73@xmath6 square pixel format , so that it oversamples the diffraction limited beam on the kao at 38@xmath0 m ( @xmath22 ) , yielding resulting @xmath23 field of view .",
    "kwic s filters are fully tunable cryogenic fabry - perots , which we fixed at 37.7@xmath0 m , with a 0.5@xmath0 m bandwidth for the present observations .",
    "the data were obtained using standard chopping and beam switching techniques , and calibrated by comparing with images taken of orion and m82 at the same wavelength .",
    "the system noise equivalent flux density was @xmath2420jyhz@xmath25 , and the beam size was 8.5@xmath6 .",
    "the total integration time was 34 minutes .",
    "for all observations , we dithered the array to eliminate bad pixels and flat fielded by dividing by an image of our blackbody calibration source .",
    "absolute pointing on the kao with kwic was good to @xmath24 10@xmath6 .",
    "the deep isocam @xcite broad - band mid - infrared images presented here ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were created using the spectrophotometric observations of arp299 taken on 27 april 1996 , after correcting for the transmission of the 7 and 15@xmath0 m band - passes ( of 2.5 and 5@xmath0 m respectively ) .",
    "the estimated photometric uncertainties of the images are less than 20% .",
    "details on this method as well on the reduction and calibration , of the data are presented by @xcite .",
    "the isocam field of view easily encompasses the whole system with a pixel size of 1.5@xmath6 and a fwhm of the point - spread - function ( psf ) of @xmath26 at 15@xmath0 m .",
    "our new high spatial resolution two dimensional image of arp299 is presented in figure  [ image]c .",
    "the system is clearly resolved into its two primary components : source a , the nucleus of ic694 , and source b , the nuclear region of ngc3690 .",
    "source c , the overlap region to the north of source b , is not apparent as an independent source , but lies along a ridge of emission extending from source b. since the identification of the different components of arp299 has often been challenging and our 8.5@xmath6 beam is rather large , extra care was taken in registering the astrometry of our map and it is therefore useful to describe our method here . knowing the pixel scale and rotation angle of our 38@xmath0 m image we first compared our results with the 10@xmath0 m observations of @xcite and @xcite which are tied to the highly accurate vla radio continuum images .",
    "based on the spectrum of ic694 , which is discussed in more detail in the following section , we do not expect the centroid of source a to change between 10 and 38@xmath0 m and consequently we set the psf fit of our identified source a at the same position as their measured coordinates for a. furthermore , we compared our image to the 7 and 15@xmath0 m isocam maps of @xcite , revised versions of which are shown in figure  [ image]a and  [ image]b and discussed in more detail later .",
    "we concluded again that our positions for the centroid of source a were in agreement , which also enabled us to tie our 38@xmath0 m astrometry to the hst / nicmos j - band image of @xcite since the latter had been used to bootstrap the astrometry of the isocam images .",
    "measuring the angular separation ( @xmath27 ) and position angle ( -103@xmath28 ) between our source a and the second brightest peak in our map , we believe that this second peak actually coincides with the location of source b1 .",
    "this will become more apparent when we discuss the mid - infrared spectral shape of sources b1 and b2 in the next section . however , given the fact that the separation between b1 and b2 is just @xmath29 ( see fig.4c of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is well within our 38@xmath0 m beam , we feel that it is more reasonable to consider that our measurement in that location refers to the flux density of the whole nucleus b(=b1+b2 ) of ngc3690 .",
    "similarly , c and c@xmath11 , which are separated by @xmath30 and are located @xmath31 to the north of b1 , are not resolved as point sources .",
    "hence , the value we quote for source c is the one engulfed in our 38@xmath0 m beam at that position .    given the above considerations we find that source a accounts for 46% of the total flux density of the galaxy at 38@xmath0 m .",
    "source b accounts for 22% and source c for 8% .",
    "the remaining 24% is in `` diffuse '' emission over a @xmath32 area covering the galaxy .",
    "details of our photometry measurements are presented in table  [ tbl_mir ] .",
    "much of the luminosity in infrared bright galaxies emerges at wavelengths longer than 30@xmath0 m .",
    "this far - infrared radiation is `` down converted '' optical or uv radiation : dust in the interstellar medium absorbs optical and uv radiation , heats up , and reradiates the energy in the far - infrared . for most galaxies , the source of the optical or uv radiation is starlight ,",
    "although active galaxies may have a significant contribution from their active nuclei .",
    "our 38@xmath0 m image of the orion a star formation region @xcite demonstrated that the 38@xmath0 m flux arises from the warm dense photodissociation region at the interface between the orion a region and the parent molecular cloud . for orion",
    ", the 38@xmath0 m flux traces the same dust at the 60 and 100@xmath0 m studies : the observed flux matches the longer wavelength color temperature and optical depth maps very well .",
    "we expect for this to hold in general for starburst galaxies as well .",
    "for example , it is easy to show that for a gray body index of 1.5 ( f@xmath33 b@xmath34 ) the 38@xmath0 m flux is proportional to the far - infrared luminosity to within 50% for an assumed dust temperature between 40 and 150k .",
    "to first order , then , our 38@xmath0 m images traces luminosity .",
    "imaging and spectroscopy at uv , optical , and near - infrared has revealed that obscuration due to dust throughout arp299 is high .",
    "b1 , the nucleus of its eastern component ngc3690(=sources b+c ) , is visible from the uv to near - infrared , even though differential extinction of the various regions of the galaxy ( b1 , b2 , c , and c@xmath11 ) make one or the other source more dominating at a given wavelength range . it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss ngc3690 in detail .",
    "the latest high resolution analysis of the system by @xcite using the hst and nicmos , has demonstrated that it is ic694 the most enshrouded source in the galaxy , in agreement with earlier work ( i.e. * ? ? ? * ) . given the high 38@xmath0 m flux density of this component in our kao images , as well as the findings of @xcite",
    ", we will focus our attention to its properties as it appears that ic694 is responsible for the largest fraction of the far - infrared luminosity of arp229 .",
    "there are several independent clues which lead us to believe that the dominant starburst of arp299 is buried at the nucleus of ic694",
    ". its uv image ( see hst / foc archive ) shows only diffuse emission with no apparent bright core @xcite . high resolution hst optical imaging @xcite displays only patchy emission from several areas of ic694 , with a dust lane running along the southeast - northwest direction .",
    "clearly the uv and optical imaging traces only the surface .",
    "the nucleus is not associated with any of the bright optical features and only becomes visible at near - infrared or longer wavelengths ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the radio continuum and co line emission @xcite coincide with the near infrared peak , confirming that this is the dynamical center of ic694 .",
    "it also contains @xmath35m@xmath2 of h@xmath36 , nearly half of the total observed in arp299 , over an area less than 500pc in diameter @xcite .",
    "the high a surface density of molecular gas , @xmath37m@xmath2pc@xmath38 of h@xmath36 , indicates that massive star formation can be sustained over @xmath39yr @xcite .",
    "source a has a flat radio spectrum and it was first thought that an agn was contributing to a considerable fraction of the ir flux originating from it .",
    "however , as we note from table  [ tbl_mir ] , a does not exhibit an excess of emission in the 37@xmath0 m range relative to regions b and c. such a `` hot bump '' would be expected in an agn spectrum due to the presence of dust grains associated with the torus surrounding the active nucleus and heated to near sublimation temperatures ( see the spectrum of ngc1068 in * ? ? ?",
    "recent work though indicates that the flat radio spectrum of a can be attributed to free - free absorption and a high supernovae rate of 0.65 yr@xmath9 in it .",
    "this rate is almost 5 times that from sources b and c combined @xcite .",
    "the extinction of a is somewhat uncertain .",
    "as it often happens in deeply obscured objects short wavelength observations merely skim the surface of the star forming regions and do not probe deep enough to account for the total dust content .",
    "consequently its quoted value increases as a function of the wavelength used to measure it : from a@xmath40mag at @xmath41 m , to @xmath42mag at @xmath43 m , and @xmath42mag using the co @xcite .",
    "the latter value , however , depends critically on the co to h@xmath44 conversion , as well as the exact co column density in front of the buried source , both rather poorly known in this case .",
    "large quantities of dust in a are also inferred by the deep 9.6@xmath0 m silicate absorption feature in this location ",
    "much more pronounced than in any other component of the arp299 system @xcite .",
    "this result is confirmed by isocam 516@xmath0 m spectra which show that the 9.6@xmath0 m silicate band of a is indeed nearly saturated with no observable continuum emission @xcite .",
    "the overall morphology of the system in the mid - infrared , presented in figure  [ image ] , is rather intriguing .",
    "it is apparent that as we move from shorter to longer wavelengths , ngc3690 , which hosts numerous sites of massive stars and is the major source of the energy output of the system in the optical and near - infrared , progressively diminishes in its overall strength presenting a single isolated unresolved source of emission near the region b1 ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ic694 though , displays a steep rise in its spectrum and at 38@xmath0 m is more than two times brighter than ngc3690 .",
    "the ratio of the @xmath45 is 13.8 , @xmath244 times higher those of regions b and c+c@xmath11 .",
    "unfortunately , we lack the spatial resolution to examine in detail the behavior of region c@xmath11 , which according to @xcite displays the highest @xmath46 ratio among the resolved components in arp299 .",
    "consequently , it remains unclear whether this trend continues in our kwic data since we can only measure the emission within one beam at the location of c+c@xmath11 .",
    "even though the difference in beam sizes and the extent of the old stellar population may conspire against us we do find that the @xmath47 ratio of ic694 is 890 , which is again @xmath244 times higher than the same ratio for regions b and c+c@xmath11 .",
    "interestingly at 7 and 15@xmath0 m the deep isocam images reveal that 48% and 40% of their respective emission originates from areas outside regions a , b , and c contrary to just 24% we find at 38@xmath0 m .",
    "this was suggested by the 3.2@xmath0 m images of @xcite and can be attributed to emission from warm dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) due to star formation activity in the extended disks and the overlap region between the two galaxies .",
    "based on the above information and the data of table  [ tbl_mir ] we plot the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for regions a , b , and c of arp299 .",
    "we find a good fit to the 10 to 100 @xmath0 m fluxes for the three sources with a two component dust modelm image . ] , each with a gray body spectral index of 1.5 .",
    "the fit is presented in figure  [ sed ] and is valid only for wavelengths longer than 10@xmath0 m .",
    "it is well known that at shorter mid - infrared wavelengths not only feature emission from pahs dominates the spectrum , but also the grains are clearly out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "hence a more detailed treatment of the underlined physics is necessary ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the results of our model are presented in table  [ tbl_fit ] .",
    "our model suggests that for component a t@xmath48k , @xmath49 , and t@xmath50k , @xmath51 .",
    "for components b and c , the model is similar except with smaller optical depth .",
    "based on our model , we predict that the flux density of a at 100@xmath0 m is 47jy which suggests=4.81@xmath1410@xmath52 @xmath53 d[pc]@xmath16 ( e@xmath54 -1)m@xmath2 from allen s astrophysical quantities . ] that its dust mass is 9.6@xmath1410@xmath55 m@xmath2 . for a galactic dust to gas",
    "ratio this would imply @xmath2410@xmath56m@xmath2 of gas at the center of ic694 . furthermore ,",
    "if we assume `` outer cloud '' dust , then these optical depths correspond to a visual extinction , a@xmath57 250@xmath58 , or a@xmath5917 through the warm dust at region a. with a gas column to visual extinction ratio of 2@xmath60 , we also estimate that the gas and dust mass traced by the 38@xmath0 m emission at a is @xmath61 m@xmath2 .",
    "if all our assumptions are correct then based on the dust properties the concomitant gas mass is @xmath247% of the gas observed @xcite .",
    "clearly there is an additional component of cold dust not traced through its 38@xmath0 m emission .",
    "however , since the far - infrared luminosity is nearly entirely in the warm dust component , and @xmath2475% of the observed 38@xmath0 m flux comes from this component , our analysis confirms that the 38@xmath0 m flux traces the far - infrared luminosity . integrating the modeled seds",
    ", we derive infrared luminosities ( f@xmath62 ) of 1.8@xmath63 , 9.4@xmath64 , and 4.4@xmath64l@xmath2 for a ( ic 694 ) , b(ngc 3690 ) , and c+c@xmath11(overlap ) components respectively .",
    "our model fit estimates the total infrared luminosity of arp299 to be 4.6@xmath63l@xmath2 , which is 90% of the amount observed based only on the iras fluxes .",
    "one should also note that according to our model @xmath2430% of the infrared luminosity of the system is outside the above defined regions .",
    "we have obtained high resolution 38@xmath0 m mid - infrared images of the peculiar galaxy arp299 .",
    "our data clearly shows that despite its diffuse and quiescent appearance in the uv and optical , ic694 harbors a strong point - like source in the mid and far - infrared and is the dominant source of far - infrared radiation in the system . together with shorter wavelength images ,",
    "we construct the spectral energy distribution of the various components of the galaxy . we find that ic694 is by far the strongest source , with an infrared luminosity of 1.8@xmath63l@xmath2 , or @xmath2440% of the whole arp299 system .",
    "the infrared luminosity of ic694 is 6 times the luminosity of m82 , while the one inferred for component c is about 1.5 times that of m82 , making it _",
    "one of the most luminous non - nuclear starbursts known_.    our analysis suggests that in order to accurately determine the starburst activity and infrared luminosity of different regions in interacting / merging luminous infrared galaxies it is imperative to obtain good spatial resolution maps covering the 1540@xmath0 m range to better trace the colder dust component .",
    "future instruments such as irs and mips on sirtf and forcast on sofia will provide valuable information in addressing these problems .",
