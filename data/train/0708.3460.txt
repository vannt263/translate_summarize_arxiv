    "[ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(ch@xmath3coo)@xmath4(h@xmath5o)@xmath6 ( referred to as mn@xmath0 ) was widely studied due to its large magnetic anisotropy barrier ( mab ) or magnetization reversal barrier of 65  k.@xcite largely , mn@xmath0 molecules were deposited onto a surface or bridged between electrodes in two different manners : ( i ) through attractive van der waals forces between the surface and mn@xmath0 without surface - binding ligands or ( ii ) via ligand exchange with the mn@xmath0 molecules . in the latter case , for example , carboxylate terminated alkanethiolates , c@xmath7h@xmath8s , would be surface - binding ligands between the molecules and the surface,@xcite or 16 acetate ( o@xmath5c - ch@xmath3 or ac ) ligands within mn@xmath0 could be replaced by ligands o@xmath5c - c@xmath9h@xmath10-sac that create a direct strong bond to gold.@xcite scanning tunneling microscope ( stm ) images @xcite and atomic force microscope ( afm ) images @xcite on the monolayers of mn@xmath0 molecules revealed that the mn@xmath0 molecules in the monolayers are individually distinguishable rather than aggregated on the surface .",
    "photoemission spectroscopy experiments on the monolayers of mn@xmath0 derivatives showed that the mn 3@xmath11 partial density of states in valence bands for the monolayers is comparable to that for bulk mn@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite a low concentration of molecules on surfaces makes it challenging to accurately measure the magnetic properties of a single monolayer of mn@xmath0 . a recent magnetic measurement on thick monolayers of mn@xmath0 molecules exhibited qualitatively different magnetic properties from bulk mn@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite very recently , local magnetic properties of a mn@xmath0 monolayer were measured using depth - controlled @xmath12-detected nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) .",
    "this measurement also suggested that the magnetic properties differed from those of bulk mn@xmath0 .",
    "@xcite in all of the experimental systems discussed little was known about the interface between the mn@xmath0 molecules and the surface or electrodes .",
    "for example , the following questions have not been answered : ( i ) how the mn@xmath0 molecules are oriented at the interface , ( ii ) whether the mn@xmath0 molecules remain chemically intact at the interface , and ( iii ) how strongly the molecules are coupled to a surface or electrodes .",
    "therefore , it is still a controversy whether the electronic and magnetic properties of smms change due to the interaction with a surface .    to investigate mainly electronic transport and spin filtering through smms ,",
    "theoretical models @xcite were proposed based on the assumption that individual smms were not strongly coupled to electrodes , in other words , the molecular orbitals remain sharp despite their interactions with metal electrodes .",
    "then the anderson hamiltonian and an effective spin hamiltonian were used with a priori microscopic parameter values that need to be determined from atomic - scale simulations . to the best of our knowledge , smms deposited on a surface or bridged between electrodes , have not been yet studied using first - principles methods .",
    "we investigate , within density - functional theory ( dft ) , the effect of the interface on the electronic and magnetic properties of mn@xmath0 molecules on a gold surface , given a particular orientation of mn@xmath0 molecules relative to the surface .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the magnetic anisotropy comes from jahn - teller distortion around the eight mn@xmath23 ions at the outer ring . it is known experimentally that for geometry * 1 * the second - order magnetic anisotropy contributes to the total mab by 55  k and the fourth - order anisotropy by 10  k. @xcite with the total magnetic moment fixed , the mab is computed from the change of the total energy upon a rotation of the spin quantization axis from the @xmath18 to the @xmath24 axis .",
    "the mab calculated from a non self - consistent soi calculation is 57.2  k for geometry * 1 * , while the barrier from a self - consistent soi calculation increases up to 66.7  k. the latter is more precise and may include higher - order magnetic anisotropy .",
    "this result agrees with the all - electron dft - calculated barrier @xcite and experimental values.@xcite henceforth we report only the mab obtained self - consistently .",
    "the mab with total magnetic moment of 18  @xmath1 is 66.9  k for geometry * 2 * so it remains the same as that for geometry * 1*. the transverse magnetic anisotropy is calculated to be 0.02  k , which is caused by the sulfur atoms .",

    "the calculated mab for geometry * 3 * is 60.7  k that is 6  k lower than the mab for geometries * 1 * and * 2 * ( table  [ ta : table4 ] ) .",
    "thus , a reasonable value for the whole structure would be also 60.7  k. the reduction in the barrier is due to the decrease in the single - ion anisotropy for the two mn(ii ) ions close to the surface .",
    "we have investigated , within dft , the interaction between a single - molecule magnet mn@xmath0 monolayer and a au(111 ) surface through thiol bonds without long alkane chains . despite a very short bond length between the sulfur - terminated mn@xmath0 molecule and the gold slab , the broadening of the molecular orbitals was much less than the single - electron charging energy of the molecule . in the ground state",
    "the sulfur - terminated mn@xmath0 molecule has a total magnetic moment of 18  @xmath1 , but its total magnetic moment increases to 20@xmath1 upon adsorption onto the gold surface . the noticeable charge transfer from the surface to the mn@xmath0",
    "is attributed to ( i ) the relative position of the gold fermi level to the lumo and ( ii ) the long tail in the electronic cloud at the boundary of the gold surface .",
    "the self - consistent soi calculation suggested a decrease in the mab by 9% and a significant transverse magnetic anisotropy for the whole structure compared to the isolated mn@xmath0 .",
    "although a relaxation of the whole structure may bring additional transverse magnetic anisotropy caused by minor symmetry breaking of the mn ions close to the surface , it is unlikely that the molecules are completely collapsed upon adsorption .",
    "the analysis and results given in this study are not limited to the mn@xmath0 molecules and may be applicable to systems where other types of magnetic molecules or smms are adsorbed onto nonmagnetic surfaces or bridged between nonmagnetic electrodes .",
