    "rather quickly after the discovery of radio pulsars ( hewish et al . 1968 ) , it became clear that their sources are neutron stars , and the mechanism of radiation is directly associated with rotating magnetic field frozen into the body of a star ( goldreich & julian 1969 ) . magnetic fields of neutron stars : radio pulsars , x - ray pulsars and x - ray variables , are measured mainly by two methods .",
    "the first method is based on the assumption that a neutron star with a frozen - in magnetic field is an oblique magnetic rotator .",
    "then the loss of the energy by the magneto dipole radiation equals @xmath11 here @xmath12 is the radius of the star ( @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 is the angle between the rotation axis and the axis of the magnetic dipole , @xmath15 is the magnetic field at the surface on the magnetic pole , @xmath16 is the frequency of the star rotation , @xmath17 is the speed of the light . considering that the energy source is the rotation of the star , and taking into account that @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the moment of inertia of the star ( @xmath20 ) , measuring the rotation period @xmath21 and period derivative @xmath22 , we obtain the estimation for the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath15 , @xmath23 in this expression it is considered that the angle of the inclination of the magnetic dipole @xmath14 is of the order of unity .",
    "the above evaluation ( [ estmateb ] ) suggests that the expression for the magneto dipole losses of a dipole rotating in a vacuum is also true for the neutron star with a magnetosphere filled by a dense electron - positron plasma , which is born in a strong magnetic field .",
    "as was shown by beskin , gurevich & istomin ( 1993 ) , the electromagnetic radiation is screened by the magnetospheric plasma , and the loss of rotation are determined by the electric currents flowing in the magnetosphere and on the stellar surface .",
    "however , the relation ( [ estmateb ] ) remains in force for magnetospheric electric currents of the order of the goldreich - julian current , @xmath24 ( see the paper by beskin , istomin & philippov 2013 ) .",
    "the second method is to measure the absorption lines in the spectrum of x - ray pulsars .",
    "it is assumed that they are formed by cyclotron absorption in the atmosphere of neutron stars when the wave frequency @xmath25 coincides with the @xmath26 harmonic of the cyclotron frequency of cold electrons , @xmath27 .",
    "here @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the electric charge and the mass of electron , respectively .    measured by these methods , magnetic fields of pulsars",
    "are in the range of @xmath30 gauss , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( lorimer , 2001 ) .",
    "one can distinguish two groups of neutron stars - single radio pulsars with fields @xmath31 gauss and recycled pulsars with fields of @xmath32 gauss , which were or are members of close binary systems .",
    "we are not considering here a separate group of neutron stars with super strong magnetic fields , @xmath33 gauss , so - called magnetars , that emit energy stored in the magnetic field , far exceeding the rotational energy .",
    "- @xmath22 ( the period - the period derivative ) .",
    "points circled by circles and ellipses correspond to sources in binary systems .",
    "pulsars associated with supernova remnants marked by asterisks ( lorimer 2001 ) .",
    "the dashed lines correspond to different values of the magnetic field and the age @xmath34.,width=302 ]    it is seen that the neutron star with a low magnetic field , @xmath32 gauss , do have small values of the braking , @xmath35 , and hence large dynamic life times , @xmath36 years , despite they have small periods of rotation ( the majority of them are millisecond pulsars ) .",
    "neutron stars with the traditional magnetic fields , @xmath37 gauss , have a life time of @xmath38 years .",
    "this time for them is almost identical with the so - called kinematic life time , @xmath39 , where the value of @xmath40 is the height of the neutron star above the galactic plane , and @xmath41 is their proper velocity , normal to the plane of the galaxy .",
    "pulsars are fast objects with velocities @xmath42 km / s ( lyne , anderson & salter 1982 ) , so their normal speeds are of the order of @xmath43 km / s . from the fact of correlation between times @xmath44 and @xmath45 , it follows that the time of evolution ( decay ) of the magnetic field of neutron stars @xmath46 is of the value of @xmath47 years .",
    "based on these properties , we can estimate the lower limit of the conductivity of the matter of a neutron star @xmath48 .",
    "magnetic viscosity @xmath49 must be of the order of @xmath50 , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "this gives the estimate of @xmath52 .",
    "the conductivity of the crust of neutron stars is about @xmath53 ( blandford , appelgate & hernquist 1983 ) , which means that electric currents , which create the magnetic field @xmath3 frozen into the body of the star , do not flow in the crust .",
    "moreover , since the crust thickness @xmath54 is about @xmath55 , then the condition for the crust conductivity becomes even more hard , @xmath56 .",
    "all these mean that the source of the magnetic field of neutron stars is placed in the core , where the matter is in the super conducting state .",
    "nonetheless , it is clear that neutron stars , passed or are in the process of accretion , lost a significant part of their magnetic field . and",
    "this phenomenon can not be due to processes on the surface and in outer layers of the crust ( motion of matter , heating , etc . )",
    "associated with accretion of the matter .",
    "the magnetic field , originating in the core of neutron stars , can not be screened by the surface currents due to the continuity of the radial component of the magnetic field .",
    "how does accretion affect the core of the star ?",
    "the only possibility is the effect of additional electromagnetic fields arising from the accretion of the matter onto the surface of the neutron star .",
    "it should be noted that accretion of a conducting matter ( plasma ) onto a magnetized star is very different from accretion of a neutral gas or accretion in the absence of a magnetic field in the magnetosphere of a star .",
    "conducting accretion disk closes different magnetic surfaces of the magnetic field of a star .",
    "the magnetic field lines , emerging from a stellar surface closer to the magnetic pole , come to more distant parts of a disk from a star . while more equatorial lines come to the inner part of a disk .",
    "the magnetic fluxes @xmath57 inside these magnetic surfaces are different , their difference is equal to @xmath58 .",
    "then due to the rotation of magnetic field lines together with a star , there appears the difference of the potential of the electric field , @xmath59 .",
    "that is the so - called unipolar inductor ( landau , lifshitz , pitaevskii 1984 ) .",
    "the electrical voltage @xmath60 produces the electric current @xmath61 flowing in the magnetosphere along magnetic field lines due to strong particle magnetization .",
    "the closer of this current occurs on a disk in the outer region , and on a star in its polar cap .",
    "the system disk - rotating star with frozen - in magnetic field forms a simple dynamo machine , in which , depending on the direction of the electric current , a disc spins a star or a star spins a disk ( propeller ) .",
    "the presence of electric current does not mean appearance of electric charge in plasma , i.e. charge separation . charge density and electric current are independent characteristics .",
    "it is clear that any electric charge will cause the appearance of the electric field , which will restore the quasi - neutrality of a plasma .",
    "the stellar magnetosphere has a sea of electrons which neutralize any charge .",
    "the magnetic field in a magnetosphere fundamentally changes the motion of charged particles . in a magnetic field",
    "the generalized angular momentum of a particle consists of two parts : the mechanical angular momentum @xmath62 and the electromagnetic one @xmath63 .",
    "it is similar to the particle generalized momentum is the sum of the mechanical momentum @xmath64 and the electromagnetic part @xmath65 . here",
    "q is the particle charge and a is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field .",
    "but electromagnetic part of the angular momentum in the magnetosphere near a stars far exceeds mechanical angular momentum , their ratio is of the order of ratio of the cyclotron frequency of particle rotation in magnetic field @xmath66 to the frequency of rotation of a star @xmath16 , @xmath67 .",
    "this means that a charged particle , having a mechanical angular momentum far away from the star , transforms it into electromagnetic one near a star . and",
    "transmission of electromagnetic angular momentum from the plasma of a disk to a star ( and vice versa ) means existence of the flux of the moment of the pointing vector , which does not arise without generation of additional to the stellar magnetic field electromagnetic fields and electric currents .",
    "the accretion of the matter onto the surface of a magnetized star occurs in the region of the magnetic poles of the size of @xmath68 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "as we explained above , the accretion is accompanied by the electric current , this electric current forms a closed loop , it flows through the accretion disk in the direction to the star , then in the magnetosphere along the magnetic surfaces , which link the internal edge of the disk with the polar cap on the surface , then returns to the disk at the inner accretion flow for the case of a corotating disk .",
    "this current transports the angular momentum from the accretion disk to the star .",
    "its closing in the polar cap across the magnetic field produces the ampere force spinning up ( for a corotating disk ) or decelerating ( for a counterrotating disc ) the stellar rotation . the torque @xmath69 , acting on the star , equals @xmath70 here @xmath71 is the accretion rate and the value of @xmath72 is the inner radius of the accretion disk , which for corotation is equal to the radius of corotation @xmath73 , @xmath74 and for counterrotation equals the alfven radius @xmath75 , @xmath76 the value of @xmath77 is the gravitational constant , @xmath78 is the mass of the star .",
    "the physics of the plasma accretion onto a magnetized star is described in details by istomin & haensel ( 2013 ) .",
    "closing of the current occurs in the crust of neutron stars because the conductivity of the plasma in the accretion column , @xmath79 ( @xmath80 is the electron temperature , @xmath81 is the coulomb logarithm , @xmath82 ) , significantly less than the conductivity of the crust .",
    "but the conductivity of the crust is strongly anisotropic , the conductivity along the magnetic field , @xmath83 , is significantly higher than the conductivity across the magnetic field , @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the accretion current must penetrate deep into the crust , the depth of the penetration must be of the order of @xmath86 , @xmath87 is the radius of the polar cap . in addition , due to the strong magnetization of electrons , the crust also has the hall conductivity , @xmath88 , and the electric current begins to flow mainly in the azimuthal direction , creating the magnetic field directed along the axis of the penetration , i.e. along the axis of the dipole ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the electric current @xmath19 , which is necessary to create the magnetic field @xmath15 in the polar region , equals        @xmath89 it creates the torque @xmath69 , @xmath90 equating the values of ( [ startorque ] ) and ( [ torque ] ) , we obtain @xmath91^{1/3}= \\\\",

    "at the same time , the magnetic field , which equals @xmath15 on the surface , increases with depth , @xmath93 .",
    "but it exists only in the narrow tube , not penetrating into other areas of the crust .",
    "such a structure is similar to a needle and can be called the magnetic needle ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "in this section we will describe in details how the accretion current is closed in the crust in the polar region . as we mentioned above , the conductivity of the crust along the stellar magnetic field , which is almost perpendicular to the stellar surface in polar cap , is much larger than the crust conductivity across the magnetic field .",
    "it means that the current must penetrate deep to the crust .",
    "the polar cap on the surface of the star , onto which a plasma accretes from a disk , has high degree of the azimuthal symmetry .",
    "therefore , we consider the axisymmetric problem of closing of currents in the crust in the region near the axis of the magnetic dipole . in this case a closed electric current , @xmath94 , is presented in the form @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are scalar functions of the depth @xmath98 and the distance to the axis of the dipole @xmath0 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 is the azimuthal angle . since @xmath101 , the magnetic field @xmath102 is also representable in the form @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the poloidal flux of the magnetic field , and @xmath105 is the toroidal magnetic field . from the maxwell s equation",
    "@xmath106 we get @xmath107 the ohm s law for an anisotropic medium is @xmath108 where the vector @xmath109 is the unit vector along the magnetic field , @xmath110 the value of @xmath111 is the potential of the electric field , which occur in the crust when the electric current of accretion invades into it .",
    "the conductivity along the magnetic field is @xmath112 , the transverse conductivity is @xmath113 and the hall conductivity is @xmath114 .",
    "the toroidal component of the equation ( [ ohm ] ) together with equations ( [ curdens ] , [ maxwell ] ) gives the equation @xmath115 while the poloidal components lead to the equation @xmath116 let us find the value of @xmath117 from the equation ( [ base ] ) @xmath118.\\ ] ] the conductivity along the magnetic field lines is large , @xmath119 , i.e. @xmath120 this means that the electric potential @xmath121 is constant along the magnetic surface @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the electric field is directed perpendicular to the poloidal magnetic field , @xmath123 . substituting ( [ phicomp ] ) into ( [ poloidaleq ] ) , we obtain ( istomin , smirnov & pak 2005 ) @xmath124\\cdot \\\\",

    "so , it is convenient to introduce the orthogonal coordinate system @xmath127 , where @xmath128 .",
    "the coordinate @xmath129 is directed along the magnetic surface @xmath130 . in virtue of the cylindrical symmetry the function @xmath131 is a function of two coordinates , @xmath57 and @xmath129 , @xmath132 .",

    "the total electric current is zero , i.e. @xmath141 . the value of @xmath142 is the boundary value of the magnetic flux , which limits the region of existence of the electric field , @xmath143 . as a result , for the toroidal magnetic field , @xmath144",
    ", we get the following expression @xmath145 the first term in the equation ( [ torb ] ) is the toroidal magnetic field generated by the transverse electric current @xmath146 .",
    "it is estimated as follows .",
    "emerging electric field @xmath147 is determined by the ratio @xmath148 . on the other hand , under the continuity current condition @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .",
    "thus , @xmath151 , where the value of @xmath152 is the poloidal magnetic field , @xmath153 .",
    "due to the strong elongation of the magnetic surfaces , @xmath154 , the coordinate @xmath129 almost coincides with the depth @xmath98 , @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , @xmath156 , @xmath157 . the same toroidal field creates the longitudinal current @xmath158 ( the second term in equation ( [ torb ] ) ) . but",
    "the poloidal magnetic field exceeds the toroidal one due to the fact that the hall conductivity is significantly larger than the transverse conductivity , @xmath88 .",
    "the toroidal current is of @xmath159 , it generates the poloidal magnetic field @xmath160 , which near by the surface @xmath161 is @xmath162 .",
    "we see that the poloidal field @xmath163 times larger than the toroidal field .",
    "the dependence of the poloidal field on coordinates @xmath164 is given by the equation @xmath165 which is the projection of the equation ( [ fineq1 ] ) onto the direction of @xmath126 .",
    "the second term in this equation describes the generation of the poloidal field by the longitudinal electric current flowing along the total magnetic field , and thereby , partly along the toroidal magnetic field . in view of above estimations , it is @xmath166 times less than the third term in the equation ( [ poloidalfromrh ] ) that is responsible for the generation of the poloidal field by the hall current .",
    "the electric field @xmath167 is a function of the poloidal magnetic flux @xmath57 and should be zero at the boundary @xmath168 , where the toroidal magnetic field is also zero ( see the expression ( [ torb ] ) ) . because of the discussed problem is linear with respect to the electric current and hence to the magnetic field , we have @xmath169 where @xmath170 is a constant not depending on @xmath57 and coordinates @xmath171 . according to above estimations @xmath172 . standing in the equation ( [ poloidalfromrh ] )",
    "the product of @xmath173 is equal to @xmath174 , which does not depend on the magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "the hall conductivity for magnetized electrons is equal to @xmath175 , where @xmath66 is the cyclotron frequency of electrons and @xmath176 is equal to their relaxation time .",
    "but the conductivity increases with the depth @xmath98 , i.e. with the increase of the density of the matter @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the dependence of longitudinal and transverse conductivities , as well as the thermal conductivities for two values of temperatures ( @xmath177 k and @xmath178 k ) , on the density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( potehkin 1999 ) .",
    "the similar behavior have these values at @xmath179 k. averaging over quantum oscillations gives the linear dependence of the hall conductivity on the density ( potehkin 1999 ) @xmath180 thus , @xmath181 . here",
    "the index 0 indicates the values on the surface of the star ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless distances @xmath182 and @xmath183 , @xmath184 .",
    "as a result , the equation ( [ poloidalfromrh ] ) becomes equal to @xmath185 the density @xmath186 , standing in the equation ( [ dimless ] ) , is a function of the depth @xmath98 and can be approximated by a power - law dependence ( chamel & haensel 2008 ) @xmath187,\\ ] ] where @xmath188 is the characteristic scale of change of the density of the crust , @xmath189 m , @xmath190 .",

    "the derivative over @xmath98 in the equation ( [ dimless ] ) becomes small compared with the derivative over @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the equation ( [ dimless ] ) is simplified @xmath192 introducing the variable @xmath193 , the solution of the equation ( [ simpledimless ] ) is easily obtained @xmath194 where @xmath195 and @xmath196 are dimensionless constants that are determined from the boundary conditions . on the axis",
    "@xmath197 the value of the flux is zero , @xmath198 . then @xmath199 . near the surface , @xmath200 , the magnetic field should be close to uniform , @xmath201 .",
    "this condition determines the constant @xmath195 , @xmath202 .",
    "then the boundary @xmath168 is determined by the condition @xmath203 , which with a good accuracy gives the following dependence of the thickness of the magnetic needle and the magnitude of magnetic field inside it on the depth , @xmath204 the obtained dependences have a simple explanation .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field @xmath205 is generated by the hall current , @xmath206 .",
    "on the other hand , on the stellar surface @xmath207 .",
    "thus , @xmath208 . but @xmath209 , and we obtain @xmath210 . because the flux of the magnetic field is conserved , @xmath211 .",
    "the numerical solution of the equation ( [ dimless ] ) under the boundary condition @xmath212 confirms these dependence ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "we see that the accreting electric current really penetrates into the inner crust and the core of a star , while greatly narrowing and amplifying the magnetic field .",
    "when the density becomes @xmath213 the size of the magnetic tube decreases more than two orders of magnitude ( @xmath214 ) , and the magnetic field is enhanced by five orders of magnitude ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic field in the core in a small area can reach values @xmath216 gauss that essentially affects on properties of the core matter .     and across the magnetic field @xmath113 depending on the density @xmath1 .",
    "the magnetic field is @xmath217 g ( potehkin 1999 ) , width=302 ]     versus the depth @xmath98 ( chamel & haensel 2008),width=302 ]     is the solution of the equation ( [ dimless ] ) .",

    "in order to understand how the super strong magnetic field @xmath220 gauss has an influence upon the properties of the stellar matter we have to know the structure of a neutron star .    according to modern models , a neutron star has a solid crust and a liquid superfluid and super conducting core ( shapiro & tuekolsky 1983 ; chamel & haensel 2008 ) .",
    "the crust of a neutron star consists of inner ( @xmath221-phase ) and external ( @xmath222-phase ) parts .",
    "@xmath222-phase consists mainly of iron nucleus @xmath223 and degenerate gas of free electrons . because of the mutual electrostatic repulsion , nucleus of iron form the body - centered crystal lattice , thereby creating a hard outer crust of neutron stars .",
    "the density of the matter in @xmath222-phase changes from @xmath224 @xmath225 to @xmath226 @xmath225 .",
    "@xmath221-phase contains neutron - rich nuclei , which form another lattice , degenerate gases of free relativistic electrons and free neutrons . the density of the matter in @xmath221-phase changes from @xmath226 to @xmath227 .",
    "the total thickness of the crust is about one kilometer ( shapiro & tuekolsky , 1983 ) .",
    "the important property of the crust and also the core is the absence of the electron superconductivity at real stellar temperatures even at high pressures of the stellar matter ( chamel & haensel 2008 ) .",
    "when the density of the matter becomes about nuclear one , nuclei are destroyed and form the so - called @xmath228-phase , which is a homogeneous mixture of neutron , proton and electron fluids .",
    "the density of protons and electrons are equal in the frame where the star is at rest , and make up a few percent of the density of neutrons ( chamel & haensel 2008 ) . in the inner crust , at the modern view , there is the superfluid matter .",
    "this is mainly neutrons and protons .",
    "superfluidity of charged protons is associated with superconductivity .",
    "superconductivity of protons in the core of a neutron star is described by the theory of ginzburg - landau ( 1950 ) .",
    "comments about existence of super conducting vortices in a neutron star core were made by ginzburg and kirzhnits ( 1965 ) .",
    "typically , the proton coherence length in the stellar core , which is of 50 fm , smaller than the penetration length , which is of 100 - 300 fm .",
    "thus , the system of superconductors of the second kind is formed in the core ( yakovlev , 2001 ) .",
    "the magnetic flux permeates the matter of a neutron star through producing regions in which superconductivity is suppressed .",
    "the structure of these regions depends on the type of a superconductor .",
    "the type of superconductivity depends on the ratio of two scales : 1 ) the coherence length of the proton @xmath229 , at which cooper s pairs of protons can be destroyed by quantum fluctuations , and 2 ) the london s penetration depth @xmath230 .",
    "if @xmath231 then the superconductivity must be of the second kind .",
    "then , it is favorable to form a set of super conducting vortices of radius @xmath232 with a core of usual protons .",
    "each vortex carries one quantum of magnetic flux @xmath233 . for neutron stars values of @xmath229 and @xmath230",
    "are equal to @xmath234 @xmath235 where @xmath236 is the density of the matter in units of @xmath237 , @xmath238 is the fraction of protons , @xmath239 is the effective proton mass , @xmath240 , @xmath241 is the critical temperature for superconductivity of protons . substituting the values typical for neutron stars , we obtain the value of the second critical field @xmath242 , @xmath243 which suppresses the proton superconductivity . in this field",
    "the normal cores of vortices begin to touch each other that leads to the complete disappearance of the superconductivity ( glampedakis , andersson & samuelsson 2011 ) .",
    "we saw that the super strong magnetic field generated by the accretion current abolishes super conducting vortices in the inner crust and the core .",
    "but it happens only inside the narrow region of the radius of 10 centimeters in the core near the magnetic dipole axis .",
    "however , this small volume contains macroscopic numbers of magnetic vortices , more than @xmath244 . and their lack must influence upon other vortices in the core .",
    "as we wrote above , the superconductivity of the second kind takes place in the inner crust and the core of neutron stars ( baym , pethick & pines 1969 ) .",
    "magnetic vortices are arranged in the triangular lattice ( shapiro & tuekolsky 1983 ) .",
    "let us consider the interaction of three vortices located at apexes of the equilateral triangle .",
    "the repulsive force per unit length , acting on the third vortex from the first two , is equal to @xmath245 here @xmath246 is the distance between two neighbour vortices , @xmath247 is the distance to third vortex ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) . in the case of uniform distribution of vortices",
    "the total repulsive force is equal to zero .",
    "however , near the empty region the repulsive force is not compensated , and vortices must move into the region where their density is zero , i.e. inside the dead zone .",
    "so , the gradient of the vortices concentration appears in the volume outside of the region of the magnetic needle. the density of vortices @xmath26 is determined by the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath248 .",
    "so , for the magnetic field @xmath249 the density of vortices is equal to @xmath250 .",
    "the force per unit length , acting on the vortex from neighbours in the presence of the gradient of concentration , is equal to ( schmidt 1997 ) @xmath251 from the geometry one can see that @xmath252 and @xmath253 . substituting this values into the equation ( [ flucforce ] ) we obtain @xmath254 considering that the difference @xmath255 is small compared with @xmath246 , in the first approximation we obtain @xmath256 let us find the dependence of @xmath246 on the concentration @xmath26 .",
    "the area occupied by the triangle with three vortexes placed in apexes is @xmath257 .",
    "thus , @xmath258 . let us find the dependence of @xmath255 on @xmath259 , @xmath260 . as a result ,",
    "the force @xmath261 is equal to @xmath262 where @xmath263 is @xmath264 vortices are moving in the electron gas , which is not super conducting at the core temperature .",
    "if the velocity of vortices is not equal to zero , the electron gas creates the significant frictional force .",
    "this force per unit length , @xmath265 , is equal to ( alpar , langer & sauls 1984 ) @xmath266 where @xmath267 s is the electron relaxation time , @xmath268 is the density of electrons in the core of stars , @xmath269 is the velocity of vortices . considering the electron liquid is stationary relative to the star , @xmath270",
    ", we get @xmath271 of the order of magnitude the value of @xmath272 is equal to @xmath273 let us now consider the motion of super conducting vortices in the presence of the region in which the magnetic field exceeds the second critical value .",
    "this narrow area of the size @xmath274 [ rstar ] is near by the axis of the dipole . in this area",
    "the superconductivity breaks down , and the density of vortices becomes zero .",
    "thus , outside , @xmath275 , there is a gradient of vortex density , and vortices are moving to the center . in virtue of the cylindrical symmetry",
    "the velocity is directed along the radius , @xmath276 .",
    "the vortex motion is described by equations @xmath277 here @xmath278 is the mass of a vortex per unit length ( glampedakis , andersson & samuelsson 2011 ) , @xmath279 the maximum speed of vortices at @xmath280 is of the order of @xmath281 . correspondingly , the acceleration is equal to @xmath282 .",
    "thus , the inertia of vortices could be neglected .",
    "their speed is determined by the balance between the pressure and the friction force @xmath283 the vortex flux @xmath284 flowing into the region @xmath285 is @xmath286 , @xmath287 vortices are destroying in the area @xmath285 , their number is constantly decreasing in time @xmath288 the solution of equation ( [ vortexev ] ) gives the exponential vortex density decrease @xmath289 here @xmath290 is the initial density at @xmath291 .",
    "the time @xmath7 , as we will see below , the formula ( [ finalb ] ) , is the large time of the order of @xmath292 years and is explained by the small scale of the dead zone @xmath293 cm .",
    "indeed , the speed of vortex motion near the magnetic axis is of 4 cm / s , and the time to overpass the distance of the stellar radius @xmath294 cm is of @xmath295 s. but the area of the magnetic needle @xmath296 is much smaller than @xmath297 , @xmath298 , and we just obtain the characteristic time of the magnetic vortex density and the magnetic field evolution of @xmath299 s.",
    "since the magnetic field of the neutron star @xmath15 and the density of super conducting vortices in the core @xmath26 are related by the relation @xmath300 , then the evolution of the magnetic field strength occurs at the same rate of the vortex density changing ( [ solvden ] ) @xmath301 the typical magnetic field evolution time @xmath7 is equal to @xmath302 the most surprising result is the time @xmath7 ( [ finalb ] ) , determined by microscopic scales of the proton superconductivity ( @xmath303 ) , has the reasonable astrophysical value .",
    "we see that the magnetic field half - life is @xmath292 years for the initial field about @xmath304 gauss .",
    "however , this time increases for weaker initial fields @xmath305 .",
    "one can see that the time @xmath306 to achieve the field @xmath15 , does not depend on the initial field ( @xmath307 ) .",
    "this time is determined by the relation @xmath308 , @xmath309 so , it takes @xmath310 years of accretion onto a neutron star to achieve the magnetic field @xmath311 .",
    "thus , the magnetic field of neutron stars that have passed an accretion phase is determined basically by the accretion time .",
    "however , it should be noted , that to reduce the magnetic field of the star , the magnetic field at the top of the magnetic needle must exceed the second critical field @xmath242 ( [ criticalfield ] ) for the proton superconductivity destruction .",
    "this means that there is a lower limit for the final magnetic field @xmath312 , which is determined by the condition @xmath313 . here",
    "@xmath314 is the core matter density , in which super conducting vortices of the second kind exist .    at the end of this section",
    "we have to make one more remark : the elementary magnetic flux of the vortex @xmath315 , does not disappear immediately after its destruction .",
    "it is stored in the form of a magnetic field generated by an electric current flowing at the boundary of the super conducting region @xmath316 .",
    "this current is not super conducting .",
    "therefore , it fades over the time @xmath317 , where @xmath48 is the electron conductivity of the core . since the current flows across the magnetic field @xmath318 . estimating the transverse conductivity as @xmath319 , we find that the current decay time , @xmath320 , is much less than the magnetic field evolution time @xmath7 .",
    "so , the disappearance of the vortex in the time scale of @xmath292 years could be considered as instantaneous .",
    "we proposed a new mechanism for a neutron star magnetic field decay by accretion of matter onto a star .",
    "the mechanism of field decay is the accretion of a matter , which is accompanied by an electric current , generated by the rotating magnetic field in the system star - accretion disk .",
    "closed electric current loop is supported by the voltage , which is generated by the rotation of the stellar magnetic field .",
    "this current transfers the angular momentum from the disk to the star , spinning it up . to transfer the angular momentum ,",
    "the current have to flow through the stellar surface .",
    "but the conductivity of the crust along the magnetic field is significantly higher than the conductivity across the field , along which the current must be closed .",
    "thus , the electric current penetrates deep into the star .",
    "in addition , the hall conductivity is also significantly higher than the transverse conductivity - therefore , the electric current in the crust flows mainly in the azimuthal direction .",
    "so , the longitudinal magnetic field greatly increases . in the crust polar cap there",
    "occurs the narrow area , in which the magnetic field increases with depth , @xmath210 .",
    "the area of the electric current closing , in which a strong magnetic field is inside the narrowing magnetic tube ( the magnetic needle - see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , has the radius decreasing with increasing of the conductivity , and hence with increasing of the crust density , @xmath211 . if magnetic field at the end of the needle exceeds the second critical field @xmath242 , which destroys the second kind superconductivity of protons , then magnetic vortices inside the tube @xmath285 ( [ bfromh ] ) disappear .",
    "a vortex density gradient appears , it leads to the vortex motion towards their death area .",
    "thus , the density of vortices in the inner crust and in the core continuously decreases in time .",
    "this process reduces the magnetic field of the star @xmath15 .",
    "the decay law has a power law @xmath321 with the characteristic time of @xmath322 years , which depends on the initial magnetic field @xmath305 . as a result ,",
    "the final magnetic field after accretion of matter ( plasma ) , depends mostly on the time of accretion @xmath306 and is inversely proportional to it ( [ finalb ] ) . here",
    "it should be emphasized that in a wide range of accretion rate @xmath71 the evolution of the magnetic field does not depend on the accretion rate .",
    "the point is that the accretion electric current @xmath19 ( [ current ] ) is significantly less than the maximum current @xmath323 .",
    "there are more than six orders reserve of the magnitude of the accretion rate .",
    "however , the magnetic field of the star ca nt be reduced to small values , while accretion can last a long time .",
    "if the field in the inner part of the magnetic needle becomes less than the critical field , then the destruction of the proton superconductivity does not occur .",
    "the magnetic field stops to decay .",
    "this effect was actually observed .",
    "there is no recycled stars with magnetic fields less than @xmath324 ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) . using the expression for critical field ( [ criticalfield ] ) and",
    "the expression for the magnetic field in the magnetic needle ( [ bfromh ] ) , we obtain the following estimation @xmath325 which is not critical . for example , if @xmath326 in the center of the star and @xmath327 k the proposed model does not contradict the observed value @xmath324 .",
    "it should to be noted that to achieve the magnetic field @xmath328 it is necessary that the accretion continues at least @xmath329 years .",
    "we see that in the proposed model of attenuation of the magnetic field of accreting neutron stars the decisive role plays the internal structure of neutron stars .",
    "a comparison of observational data of accreting or passed a stage of accretion neutron stars with the proposed model could give information about the physical parameters of the structure of the neutron star .",
    "but it is beyond the scope of this paper .",
