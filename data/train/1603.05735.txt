    "g. g. stokes , in 1851 , derived the force per unit area acting on the surface of a sphere moving slowly in an incompressible viscous fluid and thus obtained the celebrated eponymous law for the drag force on a moving sphere .",
    "the solution for a rotating sphere would provide the drag torque .",
    "einstein used these laws in his phenomenological theory of brownian motion and obtained a relation between the diffusion coefficient of a spherical colloid and the friction constant in stokes law , the so - called stokes - einstein relation , the first example of a fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "smoluchowski , in 1911 , presented an iterative method to calculate the force per unit area on a moving sphere in the presence of another and thereby initiated the study of hydrodynamic interactions between colloidal particles @xcite .",
    "the method was refined by many authors culminating in the `` induced force '' method of mazur and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the theory of brownian motion with hydrodynamic interactions developed in parallel with major contributions from kirkwood @xcite , zwanzig @xcite , and batchelor @xcite , amongst others @xcite . through these studies",
    "it became apparent that the force per unit area on the surface of the colloid is the key dynamical quantity necessary for developing both the mechanics and the statistical mechanics of suspensions . despite this long and distinguished history",
    "the study of colloidal suspensions remains a research area of sustained fecundity @xcite .",
    "bearing testimony to this is the recent spate of experimental work on the synthesis of colloidal particles that produce flow in the ambient fluid in the absence of externally applied forces or torques @xcite .",
    "the stress in the fluid produced by this flow reacts back on the colloids and may cause them to translate or rotate .",
    "the hydrodynamic interactions between such particles are without analogue in their classical counterparts .",
    "an enormously rich variety of phenomena have been observed in suspensions of such `` active colloids '' and a systematic study of this new class of colloidal particles is now underway .",
    "it has also been realized that phoretic phenomena in gradients of externally applied fields @xcite and the swimming of micro - organisms @xcite , though distinct in the microscopic mechanisms that produce fluid flow , share many points of similarity with synthetic active colloids when viewed at the suspension scale . their study has been revitalized @xcite and subsumed into the field of active colloids .",
    "the principal feature common to both synthetic active colloids and classical phoretic motion in external fields is the appearance of surface forces , of a range much shorter than the colloidal dimensions , that drive fluid flow in a thin region at the colloid - fluid boundary .",
    "the typical width of this boundary layer is several nanometers , which is approximately a thousand times smaller than the size of the colloidal particle .",
    "this wide separation of scales makes it possible to partition the problem of determining the global fluid flow into an interior problem inside the boundary layer , where the flow is driven by the surface forces , and an exterior problem outside the boundary layer , where the exterior fluid is presented with a boundary condition determined by the flow in the boundary layer .",
    "the non - universal aspects of the problem are contained , therefore , entirely within the boundary layer leaving the exterior fluid flow to assume universal forms determined by the boundary conditions .",
    "we owe this method of analysis to smoluchowski who applied it first to his study of electrophoresis @xcite . with derjaguin",
    "s analysis of diffusiophoresis @xcite and its subsequent application to other kinds of phoretic motion @xcite , the generality and the power of this approach is now well - established @xcite .",
    "the swimming of ciliated microorganisms presents another instance of the separation of scales , as the length of the cilium on the surface of such organisms is typically a hundred times smaller than the dimensions of their body .",
    "the flow in the ciliary layer can be obtained from the prescribed kinematics of each cilium and the exterior fluid fluid then obtained by matching boundary conditions at the interface .",
    "this analysis has been developed extensively by blake @xcite , following lighthill s abstract analysis of the squirming motion of a sphere @xcite .",
    "these authors only considered axisymmetric squirming motion and it is only recently that the most general non - axisymmetric motion has been studied systematically @xcite .    in all of the above examples ,",
    "the matching condition at the edge of the boundary layer is the continuity of the fluid velocity , which now contains , in addition to the rigid body motion of the colloid , the contribution from the active flow @xmath1 .",
    "this `` slip '' velocity is a general , possibly time - dependent , vector field on the colloid surface , subject only to the constraint of mass conservation @xmath2 .",
    "the fluid mechanical problem is solved when the exterior flow is obtained in terms of the slip .",
    "the force per unit area on the colloidal surface follows directly from the cauchy stress in the fluid and the motion of the colloid is obtained , when colloidal inertia is negligible , by setting the net force and net torque to zero .",
    "the correct expression for the force per unit area was first obtained by blake @xcite for the special case of axisymmetric slip on an isolated sphere distant from all boundaries .",
    "this expression was used to compute the work done on the fluid by the slip .",
    "however , extensions of this analysis to ( i ) the most general form of slip in ( ii ) a suspension of many spheres and ( iii ) including the effect of proximate boundaries remain to be completed .",
    "the availability of such an expression would immediately allow the mechanics and statistical mechanics of active colloidal suspensions to reach the level of development of their passive counterparts .",
    "we address ourselves to this task here .",
    "below , we obtain the force per unit area in a suspension of @xmath0 spherical active colloids with the most general form of slip and including the effect of proximate boundaries such as plane walls .",
    "our results are best expressed as an infinite set of linear relations between the irreducible coefficients of a tensorial harmonic expansion of the force per unit area and the slip . as these contain the stokes laws for the force and torque as special cases",
    ", we refer to them as `` generalized stokes laws '' .",
    "the generalization has several aspects .",
    "first , expressions are obtained for every irreducible mode of the force per unit area , and not just the first two modes representing the force and the torque .",
    "second , we consider the many - body nature of the force per unit area in a suspension of @xmath0 colloids , while stokes laws in their original form apply only to a single particle .",
    "third , we consider the effect of proximate boundaries , such as plane walls , obtaining corrections of the kind first derived by faxen @xcite to the original form of stokes laws .",
    "the generalized stokes laws contain new coefficients , similar to the translational and rotational friction tensors , that are many - body functions of the colloidal configuration .",
    "we show how these generalized friction tensors can be calculated , to any desired degree of accuracy , from the solution of a linear system .",
    "this material is covered in sections [ sec : generalized - stokes ] and [ sec : boundary - integral - solution ] .",
    "the generalized stokes laws immediately provide the quantities of interest to suspension mechanics : the force , the torque , and the stresslet on the colloids . through their use ,",
    "succinct expressions are obtained for the fluid flow , the fluid pressure , and the entropy production .",
    "we apply these results in the following sections to demonstrate their utility .",
    "we note that , in addition to the applications that follow , the formalism presented here has been applied to identify the dissipative active forces and torques that drive crystallization of active colloids at plane walls @xcite .",
    "in section [ sec : langevin - description ] we use results for the force and torque to obtain the over - damped langevin equations for hydrodynamically interacting brownian active colloids .",
    "the corresponding smoluchowski equation is also derived and the activity - induced breakdown of the fluctuation - dissipation relation is demonstrated . a contracted description for the one - body distribution function , the first member of a bbgky - like hierarchy , is derived and the active contribution is highlighted . in section",
    "[ sec : suspension - stress ] , we use the result for the stresslet to obtain an exact expression for the landau - lifshitz - batchelor suspension stress as a function of colloidal configuration .",
    "we confirm that the active contribution to the suspension stress vanishes to linear order in volume fraction in an isotropic suspension .",
    "in contrast , the active contributions for a non - isotropic suspension of contractile ( or extensile ) active colloids leads to an increase ( or decrease ) of the suspension stress .",
    "in section [ sec : active - pressure ] we turn to mechanical quantities in the fluid , focusing on the fluid pressure in a suspension of active colloids confined to the interior of a spherical volume .",
    "we find that the dynamics of the colloids and the distribution of the fluid pressure are different for suspensions of extensile and contractile colloids .",
    "the difference in the collective dynamics of the colloids is understood qualitatively from the fluid flow created by the active colloids . in section [ sec : dynamics - optical ] , we use the langevin equations to study the collective motion of active colloids in harmonic traps .",
    "the traps are centered on a lattice and we consider only one active colloid per trap . through detailed numerical simulations , we find that a one - dimensional lattice of traps supports time - independent configurations but a two - dimensional lattice of traps only supports time - dependent configurations .",
    "in particular , we show that the colloids exhibit a synchronized dynamics about the axis of symmetry in a square lattice of traps .",
    "we conclude the section by relating synchrony to the entropy production in a triangular lattice .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : discussion - and - summary ] by discussing other theoretical and numerical methods for studying active suspensions and by suggesting further applications of the generalized stokes laws .",
    "we now present our main result relating the force per unit area @xmath3 to the active slip @xmath4 for @xmath5 active colloidal spheres of radius @xmath6 suspended in an incompressible viscous fluid of viscosity @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8-th sphere centered at @xmath9 has radius vector @xmath10 and orientation vector @xmath11 as shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : coordinate - system - used ] ) .",
    "the velocity and angular velocity of the sphere is @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the velocity @xmath14 of the fluid at a point @xmath15 on the colloid boundary is a sum of its rigid body motion and the active slip @xmath4 @xmath16 the wide applicability of slip to model motion driven by interfacial forces has been mentioned above . to these , we add the recent observation that        both the slip and the force per unit area are vector fields on the sphere and which invites harmonic expansions .",
    "we choose the tensorial spherical harmonics @xmath17 , where @xmath18 , as the expansion basis for reasons discussed below .",
    "these harmonics are dimensionless , symmetric , irreducible cartesian tensors of rank @xmath19 that form a complete , orthogonal basis on the sphere @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the slip and the force per unit area on the surface of @xmath8th colloid is @xmath20 the expansion coefficients @xmath21 and @xmath22 , of dimensions of force and velocity respectively , are tensors of rank @xmath19 , symmetric and irreducible in their last @xmath23 indices @xcite .",
    "elementary group theory assures @xcite that they can be expressed as the sum of three irreducible tensors of rank @xmath19 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the three irreducible parts are @xmath25 where the index @xmath26 , labels the symmetric irreducible , antisymmetric and trace parts of the reducible tensors .",
    "the operator @xmath27 extracts the symmetric irreducible part , @xmath28 the antisymmetric part and @xmath29 the trace of the operand . here",
    "@xmath30 is tensor of rank @xmath31 , projecting any @xmath19th order tensor to its symmetric irreducible form @xcite , @xmath32 is the levi - civita tensor and @xmath33 is the kronecker delta . as the @xmath34 are irreducible tensors , it is natural to parametrize them in terms of the tensorial spherical harmonics .",
    "their _ uniaxial _ parametrizations are @xmath35 it follows that the coefficients are either even ( apolar ) or odd ( polar ) under inversion symmetry @xmath36 . the leading terms of the expansion , categorized according to their symmetry under inversion and mirror reflection , are    [ eq :- slip - truncate ] @xmath37 @xmath38    here @xmath39 is the active translational velocity , while @xmath40 is the active angular velocity for a sphere in unbounded medium @xcite .",
    "the tangential flows generated by these leading terms are shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig : coordinate - system - used ] ) .",
    "their complete form , including radial terms , is provided in table [ tab : slip - velocity - on ] of the appendix .",
    "the tensorial harmonics have several advantages over the more common vector spherical harmonics or surface polynomials @xcite .",
    "first , both basis functions and expansion coefficients transform as cartesian tensors which allows physical quantities like the force , the torque and the stresslet to be represented covariantly .",
    "second , the linear independence of the basis functions ensures that linear systems for the coefficients are always of full rank .",
    "third , the basis functions are well - suited for taylor expansions @xcite and their addition theorems are considerably simpler than the usual vector spherical harmonics .",
    "this property allows for fast methods of summing long - ranged harmonics @xcite that are less complex than the classical methods @xcite .",
    "previous studies of spherical passive suspensions have amply demonstrated some of these advantages @xcite .",
    "the problem , now , is to relate the unknown values of the force coefficients @xmath41 to the known values of the slip coefficients @xmath34 .    in the regime of slow viscous flow , the fluid velocity @xmath42 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : slip - rbm - bc ] ) obeys the stokes equation .",
    "the linearity of the governing equation and of the boundary condition implies , then , a linear relation between the velocity and force coefficients @xmath43 where repeated particle indices are summed over .",
    "we call the above infinite set the _ generalized stokes laws . _",
    "their best - known special cases are stokes laws for translation @xmath44 and rotation @xmath45 .",
    "the first two terms are passive frictional contributions due to rigid body motion while the remaining terms are active contributions due to slip .",
    "the @xmath46 are generalized friction tensors and their symmetry properties , to which we shall return below , allow them to be interpreted as generalized onsager coefficients .",
    "their rank varies from @xmath47 to @xmath48 depending on the values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the friction tensors depend on the positions of _ all _ spheres , reflecting the many - body character of the hydrodynamic interaction but , due to isotropy , are independent of the sphere orientations .",
    "the force coefficients , however , depend on the orientations of the spheres carried in the coefficients of the slip . given the velocity at the boundary of each sphere , the friction tensors completely determine the force per unit area on every sphere . in the next section ,",
    "we derive exact expressions for the generalized friction tensors in terms of green s functions of stokes flow .",
    "the most direct way of computing the generalized friction tensors is through the boundary integral representation of stokes flow @xcite    [ eq : bie ] @xmath51    where @xmath52 is the fluid pressure . in the above ,",
    "repeated cartesian and particle indices are summed over and points on the boundary of the sphere are given by @xmath53 .",
    "the kernels in the boundary integral representations are the green s function @xmath54 , the pressure vector @xmath55 , its gradient @xmath56 , and the stress tensor @xmath57 .",
    "they satisfy @xmath58 the flow and pressure satisfying the stokes equation , @xmath59 and @xmath60 = 0 with @xmath61 the cauchy stress in a fluid of viscosity @xmath7 , is the sum of the `` single - layer '' integral of the traction @xmath62 and the `` double - layer '' integral of the boundary velocity @xmath63 enforcing the boundary conditions in the integral representation produces a fredholm integral equation of the first kind for the unknown force per unit area .",
    "the problem is thereby reduced from the solution of a partial differential equation in a three - dimensional volume to the solution of an integral equation over two - dimensional surfaces .",
    "this reduction of dimensionality is the main advantage of the integral equation approach .",
    "several methods of solution have been developed for fredholm integral equations for stokes flows @xcite .",
    "these differ in their choice of formulation , discretization , and strategy of minimizing the residual . here",
    ", we use a direct formulation , in which the single - layer density is the physical force per unit area , in contrast to other formulations where such an interpretation is unavailable @xcite .",
    "the choice of discretization in terms of the tensorial spherical harmonics is natural for spheres and such global basis functions yield the greatest accuracy for the least number of unknowns @xcite .",
    "finally , galerkin s method of minimizing the residual is chosen as it yields a self - adjoint linear system for the coefficients , an advantageous property for numerical solutions .",
    "remarkably , the matrix elements of the linear system can be evaluated analytically @xcite and the numerical quadrature typically associated with the galerkin method can be avoided entirely .",
    "the linear system we obtain using this direct formulation with the global tensorial harmonic basis functions and galerkin s method of minimizing the residual is @xcite @xmath64 where the matrix elements @xmath65 and @xmath66 are given in terms of the green s function @xmath67 and its derivatives , see appendix [ appendix : boundary - integrals - iterative - sol ] .",
    "this linear system differs in important ways from superficially similar linear systems derived for passive colloids @xcite .",
    "first , the right - hand sides of the equations corresponding to the rigid body motions contain self - propulsion and self - rotation contributions ; these are absent in passive colloids .",
    "second , the double - layer integral adds a non - trivial contribution to the linear system ; this is trivially zero in passive colloids as rigid body motions are in the null space of the double - layer . finally ,",
    "the equations for the non - rigid body modes are inhomogeneous , both due to double layer and slip contributions ; these equations are homogeneous for passive systems as both double - layer and slip contributions are zero .",
    "linear systems for passive colloids , derived earlier by mazur @xcite and by ladd @xcite , are recovered from the above when all @xmath34 are set to zero .",
    "the generalized stokes laws are obtained as solutions of this linear system .",
    "the formal solution of the discrete linear system yields the following expression for the friction tensors @xmath68_{ij}^{(l,\\,l')}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}^{(l'\\sigma')}.\\label{eq : generalized - friction - tensor}\\ ] ] in the above , we have introduced the block matrices @xmath69 and @xmath70 whose @xmath71 element in the @xmath72 block are @xmath65 and @xmath66 respectively .",
    "the many - body character of the friction tensors is apparent from this expressions , as the inverse of @xmath69 can not be expressed in terms of sums of the pairwise interactions encoded in its matrix elements .",
    "since the matrix elements only involve particle positions and not orientations , the friction tensors are , likewise , independent of particle orientation .",
    "the method of solution for the linear system , or equivalently , of inverting @xmath69 must be chosen according to need . for analytical solutions ,",
    "jacobi s iterative method is straightforward and its widespread use in stokes flows can be traced back to smoluchowski s method of reflections .",
    "other tractable analytical methods rely on appendix [ appendix : traction - relations - for - unbounded ] . for numerical solutions ,",
    "iterative solvers with faster rates of convergence must be used .",
    "typically , these search for the inverse in the krylov subspace of @xmath69 and have the advantage of requiring , instead of @xmath69 , only its action on a vector of the appropriate size .",
    "the need to store a large dense matrix is thereby avoided . for the self - adjoint linear system above",
    ", the stable , efficient and accurate conjugate gradient method @xcite may be used .",
    "this requires @xmath73 computational effort for @xmath74 unknowns when matrix - vector products are computed directly .",
    "the use of fast summation methods can reduce the cost to @xmath75 @xcite or even @xmath76 @xcite . with these preliminary remarks ,",
    "we postpone the study of numerical solutions for the friction tensors to a future work .    the boundary integral representation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : bie ] ) can be used to obtain explicit expressions for fluid velocity and fluid pressure at any point in the bulk of the fluid . by expanding the traction and velocity in the boundary integral expression",
    "we obtain expression for fluid flow and pressure in terms of the tensorial coefficients as    [ eq : v - p ] @xmath77    where the boundary integrals for velocity , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , are given in terms of the green s function @xmath80 and its derivatives .",
    "similarly , the boundary integrals for pressure , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , are given in terms of the pressure green s function @xmath55 and its derivatives .",
    "both results are derived in appendix [ appendix : fluid - vel - pressure ] . using the generalized stokes laws of eq .",
    "( [ eq : traction - l - sigma ] ) and force balance condition of eq .",
    "( [ eq : newton - equations - constraints ] ) , the unknown force coefficients can be written in terms of the known velocity coefficients and the body forces and torques .",
    "the expression for fluid velocity and pressure can be then expressed entirely in terms of known quantities as    @xmath83    here @xmath84 and @xmath85 are matrices which , respectively , relate the fluid velocity with body forces and torques while @xmath86 give the linear relation between coefficients of slip velocity to fluid velocity .",
    "the contribution of body forces to pressure is given by @xmath87 , while @xmath88 gives the contributions from the symmetric irreducible modes of the active slip .",
    "it is instructive to note that only symmetric traceless parts @xmath89 , of the slip modes contribute to the fluid pressure , as pressure is harmonic , unlike the fluid velocity which is biharmonic . @xmath86 and @xmath90 are tensors of rank @xmath19 and @xmath91 , respectively , and in an unbounded fluid , decay as @xmath92 and @xmath93 with distance @xmath94 .",
    "the power dissipated in the volume of the fluid can be reduced to integrals of the colloid boundaries @xmath95 and using eq .",
    "( [ eq : unknown - traction ] ) and the orthogonality of the tensorial harmonics , can be expressed in terms of the expansion coefficients as @xmath96 the generalized stokes laws can now be used to eliminate the unknown force coefficients for the known velocity coefficients to obtain @xmath97 the positivity of power dissipation ensures that the friction tensors are positive - definite .",
    "the differences with passive colloids are noteworthy : the colloids can produce flow in the absence of external forces and torques and both this flow and the pressure depend on the position and the orientation of the colloids .",
    "the latter fact is illustrated in fig .",
    "( [ fig : orientation - dependence ] ) of the appendix .",
    "the contributions from the slip makes flow in active suspensions intrinsically more rich and leads to novel phenomena with no analogue in passive suspensions .",
    "we now turn to applications of the above results .",
    "the net hydrodynamic force @xmath98 and torque @xmath99 acting on the @xmath8th colloid are related to its first two irreducible coefficients of the traction @xmath100 @xmath101 and from the generalized stokes laws these are    [ force - formulation ] @xmath102    here , the @xmath103 with @xmath104 are relabellings of the four friction tensors @xmath105 with @xmath106 , where the correspondences are @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath109 and @xmath110 are relabellings of the friction tensors @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "the first two terms in the force and torque expressions above are the usual rigid body drag @xcite while the remaining terms are the contributions from the slip .",
    "the effect of activity is then clear : it adds long - ranged , many - body correlated , orientation - dependent dissipative forces and torques to the familiar stokes drags .",
    "expressions for the friction tensors in terms of green s functions of the stokes equation have been derived in appendix [ appendix : boundary - integrals - iterative - sol ] .",
    "examples of the green s functions of stokes flow for typical flow geometries used in the experiments of active colloids is provided in table [ tab : geometries - g ] .",
    "as shown in appendix [ appendix : boundary - integrals - iterative - sol ] , the leading order contribution to the friction tensor is @xmath113 in an unbounded fluid , this decays as @xmath114 and is thus long - ranged for @xmath115 thus , all slip modes up to @xmath116 produce long - ranged forces and up to @xmath117 produce long - ranged torques .",
    "notably , the active forces and torques have contributions even without self - propulsion , @xmath118 , or self - rotation , @xmath119 , indicating that colloids can be `` active '' without necessarily being self - propelling or self - rotating .",
    "the friction tensors depend on the positions of all the particles and are thus many - body functions of the instantaneous colloidal configurations .",
    "a remarkable feature of active forces and torques is that they depend not only on the relative position of the particles , as in a passive suspension of spheres , but also through the slip moments , on their orientations .",
    "thus active colloids , even if they are geometrically isotropic , are hydrodynamically anisotropic",
    ". an intuitive understanding of the orientation - dependent forces and torques can be obtained by studying fig .",
    "( [ fig : orientation - dependence ] ) , where a change in orientation of the active colloid alters the flow field it `` carries '' and consequently the stresses that are transmitted by this flow field .",
    "finally , though these forces and torques appear in newton s equations , they are , emphatically , not body forces and torques : they are the sum of the dissipative surface forces that act at the fluid - solid boundary .    the active forces and torques obtained above can be used to construct the langevin equations describing the motion of active colloids in a thermally fluctuating fluid . in the microhydrodynamic regime particle inertia is negligible and newton s equations reduce to @xmath120 implying instantaneous balance between dissipative hydrodynamic forces @xmath98 , body forces @xmath121 and brownian forces @xmath122 , together with the corresponding balances for the torques @xcite . the brownian forces and torques , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , are zero - mean , gaussian white noises and the fluctuation - dissipation relation fixes their variances to be    @xmath124    where @xmath125 is the boltzmann constant and @xmath126 is the temperature .",
    "we do not consider any fluctuations corresponding to activity , since its inherently non - equilibrium nature precludes any possible balance between fluctuation and dissipation . using explicit forms , the langevin equations for brownian active colloids with hydrodynamic interactions are    [ force - formulation-1 ] @xmath127    the above equations contain forces due to stokes drags , body forces , thermal fluctuations , and activity .",
    "motion is driven by the last three terms and their relative importance can be captured by two ratios .",
    "we choose the first of these to be the ratio of active and body forces and the second to be the ratio of thermal and active forces .",
    "similar considerations apply for the torque balance .",
    "these motivate the introduction of the following dimensionless numbers @xmath128 here @xmath129 and @xmath130 are `` activity '' numbers quantifying the relative importance of active and body terms @xcite while @xmath131 and @xmath132 are `` brown '' numbers quantifying the relative importance of thermal and active terms .",
    "we estimate these numbers for two typical active colloidal systems below .",
    "explicit langevin equations for the velocity and angular velocity are obtained by inverting eq .",
    "( [ force - formulation-1 ] ) .",
    "since the @xmath103 and the @xmath133are identical for @xmath134 , it is convenient to group the velocity with the self - propulsion and the angular velocity with the self - rotation so that the summation is from @xmath135 onward . with this regrouping",
    ", the result is    [ eq : mobility - formulation ] @xmath136    here @xmath137 are zero - mean unit - variance gaussian white noises .",
    "the mobility matrices @xmath138 are inverses of the friction matrices @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "the propulsion tensors @xmath139 , first introduced in @xcite , relate the rigid body motion to modes of the active velocity .",
    "they are related to the slip friction tensors introduced here by    [ eq : pi - mu - relation ] @xmath140    the translational propulsion tensors @xmath141 are dimensionless while the rotational propulsion tensors @xmath142 have dimensions of inverse length .",
    "the above form of the propulsion tensors is particularly useful when mobilities are evaluated by combining the far - field and near - field lubrication contributions . through this approximation ,",
    "the need to resolve the rapidly varying flow at particle contact can be avoided , and accurate results can be obtained by keeping only the long - ranged contributions when solving the linear system .",
    "stochastic trajectories can be obtained by integrating the kinematic equations @xmath143 using the standards brownian dynamics integrators , for example that due ermak and mccammon @xcite .",
    "we note that the explicit form of the langevin equation was first obtained in @xcite using heuristic arguments .",
    "the smoluchowski equation for the distribution function @xmath144 of positions and orientations follows immediately from the langevin equations . we write it in the form of a conservation law in configuration space @xmath145 where the `` velocities '' @xmath146 and @xmath147 are @xmath148 here",
    "@xmath149 , @xmath150 , and @xmath151 is a potential that contains both positional and orientational interactions . in the absence of activity",

    "this solution has a vanishing current .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of activity , the gibbs distribution is no longer the stationary distribution and in general , only the divergence of the current is zero .",
    "circulation currents are a generic possibility in such circumstances and have , indeed , been observed in models of active colloidal systems @xcite .",
    "the smoluchowski equation above is a partial differential equation in @xmath153 variables and is generally intractable as it stands .",
