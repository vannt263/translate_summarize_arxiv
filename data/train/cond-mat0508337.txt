    "the small dimension of the cooper pairs in the high temperature ( htc ) superconductors remains being an unclear point in the physics of these materials @xcite . in our view the main point to understand is the way in which the strong coulomb repulsion which should be present between the two particles at distances of the order @xmath0 @xmath1 ( the estimated size of the pairs ) , should be somehow compensated for allowing the particles to be bounded .",
    "the cancellation in the old superconducting materials is carried out by the normal metallic screening at the cooper pair sizes in these materials which are of the order of hundreds of @xmath2 .",
    "it allows the weak phonon attraction to realize the binding .",
    "considering this situation one is led to the idea that there should exist special characteristics of the htc materials allowing the mentioned compensation of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "one of the most salient features of the materials showing high tc superconductivity is the presence of lattice planes formed by cu and o atoms in a nearly square arrangement @xcite .",
    "therefore , it can be naturally suspected that the 2d character of the electron dynamics of those planes could be closely connected with the screening of the coulomb repulsion at short distances .",
    "following this idea , in the present work we investigate the screening of the coulomb potential in a simple tight binding model chosen to qualitatively resemble the valence electron properties of the high tc materials . in order to allow the arrival to analytical results ,",
    "the model is constructed as simple as possible and purely two dimensional .",
    "the main aim will be to obtain an estimation of the dielectric function and the kernel of the bethe - salpeter bound state equation associated to the coulomb interaction .",
    "the model will be a simple tight binding one designed , roughly speaking , to match the dispersion relation of the half filled band crossed by the fermi energy in the high tc materials .",
    "the energetic width of this band is extracted from the work [ ] .",
    "some additional simplifying assumptions also help to reduce the mathematical complications in the estimation of the dielectric function and the kernel .",
    "however , we think that they do not sacrifice the qualitative physical essence of the discussion .",
    "it should be stressed that the justification for starting from this simple model , comes from the need of reducing the technical complications created by the lack of full translation invariance of the physical problem .",
    "this fact cancels the simple dependence of the dielectric response quantities of homogeneous systems on the difference of the spatial arguments .",
    "this circumstance led us to search for analytical results in the non - interacting part of the electronic hamiltonian allowing to better tackling the complications in evaluating the dielectric response .",
    "the calculations are done following the method developed by hanke and sham for the calculation of the dielectric response properties of crystalline systems @xcite .    in our view",
    "the obtained results for the dielectric function and the interaction kernel  have interesting physical implications .",
    "they indicate that , whenever other higher contributions do not balance out the effect of the here presented ones , the amount of screening produced by the planar electrons can be intense when the system is near half filling .",
    "thus , the possibility is suggested of the occurrence of a strong screening of the coulomb repulsion in the real materials for small doping .",
    "being close half filling , the evaluated dielectric functions can reduce the value of few @xmath3 of the bare coulomb potential at distances of few periods of the spatial lattice , to values of the order of 0.1 @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , a possibility is indicated for other weak binding mechanisms to furnish the necessary attractive forces for the pair creation .",
    "current ideas consider that a combination of diverse forces ( super - exchange , electron - phonon , excitonic , polaronic , etc . )",
    "could play a role in the formation of the cooper pairs .",
    "however , experiments have still not allowed to fix the  nature of the acting mechanism , or at least , there is no consensus about the relevance of any particular one @xcite .",
    "it also follows that the screening effects rapidly decrease when the density of holes created on the half filled ground state increases .",
    "this property in competition with the natural need for a non vanishing hole density for the superconductor condensate to exist , could furnish an explanation for the first growing and after decreasing value of the critical temperature as a function of the hole density .",
    "up to our knowledge , the idea that the coulomb potential in a 2d crystal system can contribute to produce , not only screening but even binding between pairs , was firstly advanced by d. mattis @xcite . also various authors have been also considering the effects of screening in superconductivity along various directions of thinking @xcite .    a special point to be noticed",
    "is the fact that the here considered rpa approximation , in general grounds , is more  suitable in situations in which the kinetic energy is greater than the interaction one @xcite .",
    "this means that the limit of validity of the here evaluated quantities should be closely examined , since the interactions are  important in the high tc materials .",
    "however , it can be stressed that the applicability of the rpa in  hubbard like models in the metallic region up to near the metal - insulator transition has been argued @xcite .",
    "this question is expected to be more closely addressed elsewhere .",
    "it should be also underlined that the results presented here support the also strong screening effects , and even over screening , of the on - site coulomb coefficients in single and two bands hubbard models reported in [ ] .",
    "the study of the possible connections between these results with the ones presented in this work seems to be worth considering in further studies .",
    "the particular motivation for realization of the present work was created by the already mentioned observations about the characteristics of the htc superconductive systems : a )  the remarkable smallness of the cooper pairs ( of the order of @xmath5 ) .",
    "b ) the foreseeable need of a mechanism being effective in screening the coulomb repulsion , which is of the order of few @xmath4 at distances of the size of the cooper pairs .",
    "the existence of such a mechanism then could allow the short distance attraction of other participating forces , like the super - exchange interactions by example , to bind the pairs @xcite .",
    "the structure of the work will be as follows :  in section 2 , the tight - binding model for the @xmath6 ceramic @xmath7 planes will be defined .",
    "simple gaussian orbitals are introduced from the start , allowing ( following wannier @xcite ) to find explicit expressions for the bloch functions .",
    "then , the tight binding dispersion relation @xmath8 for the model is matched to the one shown by the existing half filled band in the @xmath9 materials @xcite . in section 3  the fermion free propagator of the model is employed to obtain formulae for the proper polarization and its fourier transform in the ladder ( rpa ) approximation .",
    "further , in section 4 , employing the results for the proper polarization , a formula is also derived for the screened coulomb potential .",
    "all these expressions show the complicate dependence on two arguments which follows from the lack of translation invariance of the system .",
    "then , section 5 starts the application of the tight binding approximation to simplify the formula for the screened coulomb potential .",
    "the final section 6 is devoted to the calculation of close expressions for the dielectric function and the coulomb screened kernel of the bound state bethe - salpeter equation .",
    "these quantities arise as functions of only one argument : the conserved transmitted reduced quasi momentum in the first brillouin zone .",
    "this is the main technical result of work , since the breaking of the translational invariance of the problem  obstacle the finding of such formulae in general .",
    "the simplifications were a direct consequence of the tight binding approximation and allowed to plot these quantities in the first brillouin zone for reasonable values of the parameter defining the overlapping in the tight - binding model .",
    "the results indicate the possibility for the existence of a strong screening of the coulomb interaction for conditions resembling the ones present in the real materials and they are commented in this ending section .",
    "this section introduces the simple model for the  @xmath7 planes in the superconducting ceramics .  as the superconductive properties along the @xmath7  layers are significantly stronger that in the perpendicular @xmath10 axis , the movement will be considered as  two dimensional .",
    "then , it will be supposed that the electrons move in a square 2d lattice of  unit cell size @xmath11 @xmath12 this value of the unit cell parameter of the @xmath7  lattice was borough from the work @xcite . in order to simplify the screening calculations in the considered  non translational invariant problem",
    ", we will also adopt a picture motivated in the one band @xmath13-model , in which simple gaussian orbitals are centered only on the @xmath14 sites .",
    "it is expected that the results for the screening effects on the coulomb potential  that are obtained in the work could  be good indicators of what occurs in the real systems .",
    "the gaussian orbitals staying on the points of the square lattice ( see the figure [ lattice ] ) will have the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the distance to the origin which will be taken as a fixed point of the lattice and @xmath17 is a positive constant .",
    "from now on , all the vectors  will be represented in boldface characters .",
    "the function @xmath18 is normalized in the whole plane of the crystal .  the value of @xmath17   measures the width of the spatial region where the orbital have appreciable values .",
    "let us now consider the determination of the analytic form of the orthonormalized  set of bloch wave functions @xcite ,  generated by the orbitals ( [ orb_gaus ] ) when displaced on to all the points of  the considered squared lattice .",
    "the valence electrons  of this band will be assumed to be loosely bounded to the atoms laying on the lattice points .",
    "then , they can  propagate along the crystal feeling a periodic potential created by the ions and the rest of the electrons being more bounded to the atoms .",
    "these more localized electrons will be assumed to pertain to the filled energy bands of the whole crystal .",
    "then , we will search for the bloch functions  associated to the valence electrons in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the position vector of a general point of the square lattice . as usual",
    ", it follows that the functions ( [ func_bloch_planteam ] ) satisfy the bloch conditions @xmath21    the proposed bloch orbitals  will approximately describe the valence electrons in the crystal receiving the action of  the periodic potential of the atoms and core electrons .  as stated before ,",
    "the rest of the electrons are more deeply bounded to the atoms  and their effect will be assumed to produce produce a kind of  mean field influence on the valence electrons .",
    "the just defined functions become orthogonal among them due to the very same construction , since they are eigenfunctions of the translations in the lattice with different eigenvalues .",
    "it rests only to define the normalization factor @xmath22 in ( [ func_bloch_planteam ] ) by imposing the additional validity of the orthonormality condition @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the kronecker delta in the  indices @xmath25 of the states .  for this purpose",
    "let us substitute the sums defining the bloch functions in ( [ orto_nor_func_bloch ] ) and use the property @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the total number of points of the lattice and @xmath28 for which  @xmath29 , @xmath30 are the spatial periods of the crystal in the two principal orthogonal directions , defined by the born - von karman boundary conditions . after that",
    ", the normalization constant follows in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32  is the translation operator shifting the arguments of the functions in the vector @xmath20  as @xmath33 .",
    "the bloch orbitals can be explicitly evaluated in terms of the elliptic theta functions .",
    "it can be noticed from the fact that their definition is given by a sum of  gaussian functions .",
    "then , after substituting ( [ orb_gaus ] ) in ( [ func_bloch_planteam ] ) , it follows    @xmath34    where it was defined @xmath35 and @xmath36 = @xmath37 @xmath38  in which @xmath39 , @xmath40 are unit vectors along the directions of the crystal axes .  the precise definition of the elliptic function employed was@xmath41    in an analogous way , the normalization factor can be calculated in the form@xmath42    the obtained bloch orbitals satisfy the property @xmath43 which directly follows from substituting @xmath25  by @xmath44 in ( [ func_bloch ] ) after taken into account the elliptic function property : @xmath45 .",
    "let us impose now the tight binding approximation corresponding to the physical case in which the overlapping of the valence electron orbitals is small .",
    "therefore , it will be considered that the wave functions are closely localized  around the points of the lattice .",
    "thus , the following approximation for the integral in ( [ nk_a_medias ] ) can be written @xmath46    but , substituting ( [ muy_localizadas ] ) in ( [ nk_a_medias ] ) gives @xmath47 that is , according to ( [ muy_localizadas ] ) , it follows  @xmath48 and the bloch functions take the simpler form : @xmath49    let us now consider the spectrum of the model , assuming that the valence electron hamiltonian @xmath50 will be the most relevant one for the description of the @xmath51 superconductor properties . in other words ,",
    "the action of the ions and the core electrons will be only considered as sources of mean external fields  acting on the valence electrons . therefore according to the hartree fock approximation each valence electron will be moving in the periodic potential  created by the interaction with the ions and the core atomic electrons . as the result of these assumptions",
    ", we will remain with a system having as its free hamiltonian , the sum of the individual one particle hamiltonians of the valence electrons @xmath52@xmath53 where @xmath54 is the hamiltonian of  a valence electron @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , after also considering the tight binding approximation , it will be supposed that in the neighborhood of each point of the lattice , the free hamiltonian of an electron can be well approximated by an atomic hamiltonian @xmath56 centered in the considered point .    therefore , under the above specifications the tight - binding procedure leads to the following dispersion relation for the valence electrons in the model under consideration@xcite@xmath57   \\text { } , \\label{expresion_espectro_energia}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the fermi energy of the system and @xmath59 defines the energetic width of the band as @xmath60 .",
    "thus , the electrons will lay in states described by the wave functions @xmath61  corresponding to energies given by ( [ expresion_espectro_energia ] ) where @xmath62 here the wave vectors @xmath25 will chosen in the first brillouin zone by convention , since @xmath63 correspond to physically equivalent states .  with the help of ( [ expresion_espectro_energia ] )",
    ", it can be checked that @xmath64 as the equivalence implies .",
    "for the definition of our qualitative model , we simply matched the square lattice parameter to the experimental value .",
    "also , it was directly assumed that the one particle potentials created by the ions and the atomic kernels are the necessary ones for  fixing the width of the band in ( [ expresion_espectro_energia ] ) to the estimated value .",
    "the lattice parameter was the one corresponding to the @xmath6 planes in the ceramic material ybacuo .",
    "that is , @xmath65   as reported in @xcite .",
    "the energy width of the half filled electronic band in the material , as defined by the energy difference @xmath60 between the top and the bottom of the band , was estimated here from the data in  ref @xmath66 to be @xmath67 @xmath4 .",
    "the relation ( [ expresion_espectro_energia ] ) also well reproduce the form of the band given in @xcite .",
    "another assumption chosen for the sake of simplification is that the dispersion relation of the half filled band  is solely determined by the ionic  plus atomic kernel potential .",
    "it considers that the interaction between the valence electron does not strongly contribute to the band width , which is not necessarily valid  therefore , we expect in the further extension of the present work to perform a self consistent derivation of the band width starting from a more basic interacting hamiltonian",
    ".   now , let us precise the form of the free propagator for the valence electrons to be employed in the further evaluations . according to the above discussion",
    ", the electron states will have the form@xmath68 where @xmath61 are the bloch wave functions and  @xmath69 $ ]  y @xmath70 $ ] are the spinor states .",
    "in addition , as defined before , @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are integers and @xmath74  are the periods of the crystal  along the principal directions .",
    "then , the field operators can be written as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the spin projection quantum number .",
    "therefore , the free propagator can be evaluated from the usual formula @xcite:@xmath77|\\psi_{0}\\rangle}{\\langle\\psi_{0}|\\psi _ { 0}\\rangle}\\text { } , \\label{definicion_func_green_con_interaccion}\\ ] ] where @xmath78 is the non - interacting ground state of the model and @xmath79 means the chronological operator .",
    "the free ground state to be considered will be one in which all the electron wave functions are filled up to some  value of the fermi energy @xmath80  since  the considered problem lacks the rotational invariance , there is not a unique fermi wave vector @xmath81 associated to all the highest filled electron states .  as usual ,",
    "the field operators can be rewritten in terms of the operators creating and destroying electrons above the fermi energy  or holes below it , in the following way : @xmath82 in which the usual definitions are given of the creation of holes operators : @xmath83 as being equal to the annihilation operator of electrons at momenta @xmath25 for energies lower than fermi one .",
    "the new annihilation operators satisfy  @xmath84 @xmath85and @xmath86 , since there are no electrons over , nor holes below the fermi level .",
    "then , the expression for the valence electron free propagator can be evaluated following the usual steps in the standard form @xcite    @xmath87",
    "this section will consider the evaluation of a formula for the polarization function .",
    "further , these expression will be employed to evaluate the screened coulomb potential and the kernel of the bethe salpeter bound state equation . the lowest order contribution to the proper polarization",
    "is given by the one loop term  formed by two electron propagators .",
    "the associated feynman diagram is illustrated in the figure [ lazossumados ] as the amputated loop and its analytic expression can be written as follows    @xmath88    where for writing it , the formerly defined compact notation @xmath89 has been employed .",
    "after substituting ( [ func_green_prop_fermion ] ) it follows    @xmath90[\\text{$\\hbar$}\\omega^{\\prime}-\\widetilde{\\epsilon}(\\mathbf{k^{\\prime}})]}\\text { } , \\label{polarizacion_espacio_coordenadas}\\ ] ]    where it has been defined @xmath91    as it can be observed , the polarization has explicit dependence on two spatial arguments .",
    "this is a natural outcome since the lattice potential breaks the full translational symmetry .",
    "therefore , the model under consideration does not have a continuous translational invariance and the technical evaluation of the dielectric properties turn out to be more cumbersome than for the homogeneous systems . on another hand ,",
    "since the hamiltonian of the system is time invariant the time dependence of the polarization will be only through the time differences .",

    "the equation ( [ u(q , q)final ] )  also can be written in the form@xmath199 just defining the quantity @xmath200 .",
    "up to now , we  have been considering the polarization and effective potential kernels of a non translational invariant system .",
    "therefore , the dependence of two spatial or momenta arguments makes their study more involved .",
    "however , it can be expected that the kernel of the two valence electrons ( or holes ) bound state problem , could be simplified by the conservation of the reduced momenta in the effective interaction .",
    "thus , let us evaluate the kernel of the bethe - salpeter equation associated to the coulomb interaction",
    ".  this will be the relevant piece in the discussion of the effects of the screening to which this work is devoted .",
    "this kernel is determined by the  matrix element of the  screened coulomb potential ( [ u(q , q)final ] ) describing the dispersion of two valence electrons .",

    "for this calculation the simplifying static limit @xmath205 will be assumed .",
    "that is , further we will only explore the screening in the static approximation . in evaluating the matrix element",
    "the following  steps were followed : a ) the effective potential was substituted by its fourier transform according to ( [ ft ] ) .",
    "b ) the transformation ( [ 40 ] ) was applied to the spatial @xmath206 as well as the momentum  integrals @xmath207 , making use of the bloch condition @xmath208 and the relation @xmath209 .",
    "c )  the  tight- binding  approximation ( [ u(k ) ] ) ; that is , @xmath210  not depending of @xmath25 , was implemented .",
    "d )  the relation @xmath211 was used .",
    "e )  the  standard formula for  macroscopic crystals",
    "@xmath212 where a is area of the lattice , was employed , and finally : f )  the following expression for @xmath194 was substituted                    let us analyze the first term appearing in the definition of @xmath220 containing the kronecker delta @xmath221 , and which corresponds to the coulomb potential in the vacuum . for this contribution",
    ", it follows @xmath222        @xmath224now , after summing the two contributions , the following simple result arises for the coulomb part of the kernel @xmath225 henceforth , the dielectric function related with the screening of the bare potential has the formula @xmath226 the  evaluation of @xmath227  was done for the overlapping parameter having value @xmath228 and for a fermi energy @xmath229 , being very close , but below the mid of the band .",
    "thus , there is a very low density of holes in the system .",
    "the result of the calculation plotted over the brillouin cell is shown in the figure [ grafconstdiel ] .",
    "as it can be observed the dielectric function shows high values for special zones in the brillouin cell that run from more than 30 near the zone corners ( like the point @xmath230 down to less than 10 in other regions .",
    "note that the  zones near the diagonals correspond to relative high values of the dielectric response .",
    "the fourth order symmetry of the result is also evidenced , although some numerical errors due to the presence of singularities in the evaluated integrals weakly break it .",
    "the peaks along the diagonals are only an artifact resulting from the evaluation for a finite number of points in the brillouin cell .",
    "the obtained results momentum dependence of the dielectric function becomes a consequence of the 2d nature of the problem .",
    "moreover , if the half filling condition is approached closely the dielectric constant increases drastically ( up to values of the order of 2500 were numerically evaluated by us ) .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the van - hove singularities play a central role in the obtained effect .",
    "an additional and important outcome is that upon varying the fermi energy away from half filling ( @xmath231 ) , the values of the dielectric function along the diagonals rapidly decreases and the dependence becomes more isotropic .",
    "that is , the creation of holes reduces the screening of the coulomb potential .",
    "this property could bring a natural explanation for the firstly rising and after decreasing of the critical temperatures in the @xmath51 materials .",
    "the picture could be as follows : first , when the number of hole density grows in the low density region , the strong screening state is established and the superconductivity becomes stronger ( tc growing ) .",
    "however , as the hole density is increased even more the screening effect becomes weaker , and cancelling the enforcing effect of the growing density by increasing the coulomb repulsion .",
    "the rapid weakening effect given by the calculations done here support this last property .",
    "it should remarked that in this work we had not taken into account the dielectric constant of the medium @xmath232 ( due to the polarization of the ions and atomic cores ) .",
    "it seems that at distances of few unit cells this dielectric response could not be fully developed , but certainly its effects could be not so weak .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to introduce a multiplicative factor @xmath233 ranging between 0  and 1 ,  describing the effective proportion of the dielectric response of the ionic and core medium , which could be acting at small distances of the order of the cooper pair size .  for large distances , the parameter should be equal to one and for very short ones should tend to become smaller than one . in general , it could expected that this effect can contribute even more to the screening of the coulomb interaction obtained here .",
    "further , in the figure  [ grafkernel ] , the results of the evaluation of the screened coulomb kernel of the bound state equation for two electrons ( or two holes ) are plotted , in common with the values of the bare kernel . again",
    "the overlapping parameter and the fermi energy are @xmath234  ,  @xmath235 .",
    "as it can be observed , in the considered approximation , the screening effect is noticeable .",
    "considering that the bare coulomb interaction produces a repulsive potential of few @xmath4 at distances of the order of the lattice constant , it follows that the screening effect could reduce these values down to ones of the order 0.1 @xmath4 .",
    "but , at such small repulsion forces other mechanisms , such as super - exchange or strong phonon interactions  could then create the necessary binding forces for the pairs to form .",
    "finally it should be remarked that in order to approach the present discussion to the real situation in the superconductor materials , it seems necessary to derive a similar picture but in a self - consistent approach .  a concrete way for this program could proceed in the following steps : a ) to formulate the general coulomb interacting problem of the valence electrons but retaining the coulomb interaction exactly .",
    "b ) attempt to derive the here discussed tight binding model as a kind of hf approximation of the exact theory .",
    "c ) after that , to derive and solve the bethe - salpeter equation for bounded pairs ,  which should be expected to end including the anti - ferromagnetic interactions of the @xmath13-model as a possible bounding mechanism @xcite .",
    "the consideration of this program is in progress .    the support of our colleagues and friends in the group of theoretical physics of icimaf and the faculty of physics at havana university , where the main content of this work has been done is deeply acknowledged .",
