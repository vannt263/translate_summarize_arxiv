    "many data on the cross sections of neutrinos or antineutrinos with light nuclei , namely @xmath1c , are now available @xcite .",
    "in addition to extensive miniboone results @xcite , the t2k collaboration has issued data on the inclusive double differential cross section @xcite .",
    "the investigation of this quantity is interesting because it brings another test for the validity of a theoretical description . indeed",
    "the t2k neutrino beam @xcite is different from the miniboone one @xcite , it peaks at similar energies , @xmath2 mev , as the miniboone one but it is definitely narrower and closer to a monochromatic beam .",
    "thus the analysis of the t2k data offers another test for our description .",
    "the differential cross section measured by t2k incorporates pion production . in our work of ref .",
    "@xcite we calculated the quasielastic channel , the multinucleon one and the single pion ( coherent and incoherent ) emission . assuming that these are the only channels involved in the experiment , the t2k data are linked to our total response .",
    "we also discuss in this work the miniboone data on the double differential partial cross section for single pion production @xcite .    one interesting aspect of these data is the fact that in the angular distributions one bin corresponds to small angles for muon emission , @xmath3 for miniboone and @xmath4 for t2k .",
    "the measurement of the forward cross section offers a chance of access to the elusive isospin spin - longitudinal response which is of a particular interest due to its collective aspects with the presence in particular of the coherent pion production channel .",
    "the isospin spin - transverse response , where coherent pion production is essentially absent , quickly dominates when one departs from the forward direction .    in this work",
    "we use the same model which has been successful for the miniboone data on the neutrino and antineutrino quasielastic - like cross sections , the total or the double differential ones , as shown in refs .",
    "we summarize here the basic ingredients of this model which is based on the nuclear response functions . in our description",
    "the quasielastic response is treated in the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , as discussed by alberico _",
    "et al . _ in ref .",
    "for the isospin spin - transverse response the particle - hole force is repulsive and its main effect is a hardening effect and a quenching one due to the mixing of nucleon - hole states with delta - hole ones , the ericson - ericson  lorentz - lorenz effect @xcite .",
    "the multinucleon contribution is evaluated as in our previous articles @xcite .",
    "it is deduced from the microscopic calculation of alberico _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the role of two particle - two hole ( 2p-2h ) contribution in the inclusive @xmath5 transverse response .",
    "this calculation includes the correlation term , the two - body exchange terms , in particular the one associated with delta excitation , and the interference between these quantities . as for the single pion production we assume , as previously @xcite , that it arises exclusively from the pionic decay of the delta excitation . in the nucleus",
    "the delta width is reduced by medium effects such as the non pionic delta decay which leads to 2p-2h or 3p-3h excitations ; they have been introduced and discussed by oset and salcedo in ref .",
    "we use their parametrization for the in - medium delta width .",
    "the non pionic decay of the delta in the medium contributes to our n particle - n hole ( np - nh ) cross section .",
    "we first discuss the t2k results @xcite . the t2k cross section for charged currents ( cc ) does not isolate specific channels but sums over all accessible final states . for the comparison with these data",
    "we assume that the only channels opened are the quasielastic , the multinucleon emission and the single pion production .",
    "notice that here , in contradistinction with the pion emission case , the final state interaction of the emitted pion which depopulates the pion channel , populates multinucleon states and therefore does not reduce the inclusive cross section .",
    "figure [ fig_t2k_d2s ] displays our prediction for the double differential cross section as function of the emitted muon momentum , for the various angular bins .",
    "the experimental points are the t2k measured ones .",
    "we show separately the different components of the theoretical cross section : first the genuine quasielastic channel , second the total quasielastic - like one including the multinucleon component and the total one including the single pion production cross section .",
    "the separate contributions are given in order to allow future comparisons with analysis of the quasielastic channel in t2k which are in progress @xcite .",
    "the coherent pion production component is also shown in fig . [ fig_t2k_d2s ] but in this inclusive cross section its contribution is too small to be singled out . our evaluation is compatible with the data . as in our previous analysis of the miniboone quasielastic - like cross sections",
    "the multinucleon component is needed in order to reproduce the experimental results .            for the smallest angle bin some underevaluation in the theory seems to show up .",
    "in this respect we can make the following comment .",
    "the forward direction , which corresponds to @xmath6 , is special in one important aspect : the spin transverse and the charge ( isovector ) contributions are kinematically suppressed and only the spin longitudinal one survives @xcite . for small or moderate @xmath7 values ,",
    "this last response includes two separated regions of response , one at relatively large energy transfers , @xmath8 , and one at low energy with the quasielastic component .",
    "in addition in nuclei the np - nh response fills all the @xmath9 plane .",
    "the large energy part contributes to pion emission , coherent or not , and to multinucleon emission .",
    "they are included in our predictions .",
    "the contribution of the low energy part , in the quasielastic region , should in principle be important .",
    "however in the evaluation of the spin longitudinal contribution there appears a factor @xmath10 $ ] , which vanishes identically for the quasielastic kinematics @xcite . strictly speaking this cancellation",
    "is true for a nucleon initially at rest but in practice it remains true also in the fermi gas .",
    "indeed our numerical evaluation of the spin longitudinal quasielastic contribution in neutrino or antineutrino interactions ( which is the same in both cases ) shows its smallness for all neutrino energies , as illustrated in fig .",
    "3 of our previous work @xcite .",
    "one can also observe in fig.[fig_t2k_d2s ] that the quasielastic contribution is smaller for the smallest angle bin . in view of these cancellations one",
    "is led to consider other contributions beyond the quasielastic kinematics in order to avoid the canceling effect .",
    "this is for instance the case for the excitation of collective giant resonances .",
    "their energy is low , @xmath11 10 - 30 mev , which is small compared to the neutrino one , some hundreds of mev .",
    "the small energy transfer in their excitation implies that the muon energy is nearly the same as the neutrino one , a few hundreds of mev , the region where the excess of the experimental cross section seems to occur . at large angles the contribution of the collective states is suppressed by form factor effects @xcite .",
    "several studies have been made on the excitation of low energy collective states in neutrino interactions @xcite but specific work is needed to assess their role in the present type of data where forward bins offer favorable conditions to display their contribution .",
    "for the inclusive cross section as a function of the neutrino energy , experimental results have been previously published by the sciboone collaboration @xcite .",
    "we report them in fig .",
    "[ fig_incl_scib ] together with our theoretical prediction which gives a good fit of the data up to @xmath12 gev but underestimates the cross section above this value , as also reported by nieves _",
    "the natural interpretation is the existence of other channels which open up at high energies and which have not been included in our analysis .",
    "a likely candidate for the missing channel is the multipion production , in particular the two pion production one , as also suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite . as an illustration of the likely importance of this channel and although it has no direct connection to the neutrino cross section we report in fig .",

    "gev the two pion production cross section dominates over the single pion one and it represents an important part of the total cross section . for incident pions",
    "as well , the two pion production cross section which has been studied by oset and vicente vacas @xcite becomes important for energies above the delta resonance and it increases with energy . for neutrinos as well one can expect a similar behavior with a dominance of the two pion emission as compared to that of a single pion .",
    "the evaluation of the two pion production process by neutrinos has been studied by hernandez _",
    "@xcite but only close to the two pion threshold .",
    "it should be extended at larger energies .",

    "the reason for the inferior quality of the fit as compared to the double differential cross section is not clear . at low energy the fact that the data are below the predictions could be an effect of the pion final state interaction which is not incorporated in our theoretical description . while the underevaluation above 1 gev may be due to the two pion process . it does not enter directly in the single pion production process but it could influence it through a misidentification phenomenon , if one of the two pions is absorbed in the nucleus on its way out .",
    "but in this case the reason for the success of the description of the double differential cross section remains unclear .",

    "[ fig_minib_d2s_piplus_cos0975 m ] . here",
    "the coherent contribution is significant although not dominant .",
    "this contribution is interesting due to its relation to a high energy collective state of the nucleus , denoted the pion branch @xcite .",
    "it is a coherent mixture of delta hole states and pions , as was nicely illustrated in the two level model of delorme and guichon @xcite . in the @xmath17 plane the pion branch , which embodies the modification of the dispersion relation for pion propagation in the nuclear medium by the polarization of the medium , i.e. , by the virtual excitation of delta - hole states , sits at lower energies than the free pion line .",
    "it can only show up for probes which have , as the pion , a spin longitudinal coupling , @xmath18 , i.e. , along the momentum @xmath19 . in the interaction of physical pions with nuclei it shows up only indirectly since the energy momentum relation , restricted to that of a physical pion , @xmath20 , is not that of the collective state . in this case",
    "one observes only the depletion due to the undetected collective state .",
    "the condition for its display in neutrino interaction was discussed by delorme and ericson @xcite .",
    "they pointed out that , for neutrinos , it is only in the forward direction that the spin longitudinal response which is sensitive to the pion branch , can dominate the cross section .",
    "this response contains the coherent pion production which represents the emission of a physical pion by a delta - hole bubble , the nucleus remaining in its ground state .",
    "pion emission can also occur via a series of delta - hole bubbles , i.e. , via the pionic decay of the pion branch in which the collective state transforms into a pion , as illustrated in fig.[fig_delta_coherent ] .",
    "the signature for the collective pion branch is a shift towards smaller energy transfer of the coherent pion emission cross section with respect to the first order term with only one delta - hole bubble . in the miniboone experiment",
    "the contribution of the coherent term is not sufficient to perform a quantitative study but this possibility can be envisaged for the future .",
    "notice that in analogy with the photoproduction of neutral and charged pion leading to discrete nuclear states @xcite , also for the neutrino interactions a contribution from low energy excitations of @xmath1c or @xmath1b in the case of charged currents , together with one pion emission , a `` quasi coherent '' pion emission , can also be expected in the forward bins .",
    "it is not included in our description .",
    "in summary we have tested our model of the neutrino nucleus interaction on the t2k inclusive data and on the miniboone single pion production cross section . for the double differential cross sections which are free from neutrino energy reconstruction problems the agreement is generally satisfactory .",
    "the comparison with the t2k inclusive results represents the first successful test of the necessity of the multinucleon emission channel in an experiment with another neutrino flux with respect to the one of miniboone .",
    "even with the inclusion of the np - nh excitations , some underevaluation by the theory of the t2k data seems to show up in the forward direction .",
    "it could be due to some contributions not included in our description , such as excitations of low - lying giant resonances . in the single pion production miniboone data the lowest angle bin is sensitive to the coherent pion production cross section .",
    "presently the importance of this contribution is not sufficient to perform a detailed study of this interesting channel but in the future it could become accessible with some improvements in the angular resolution so as to be more concentrated on the forward direction . for the integrated cross sections the underevaluation of our theory with respect to the data above an energy , @xmath21 gev is presumably due to the two pion production process which influences the inclusive cross section directly , but also the single pion exclusive one through a misidentification process if one of the two pions is absorbed .",
    "the theoretical description should be improved in this direction with the inclusion of the two pion channel .",
