    "the efficient distribution of resources is a challenging problem relevant for many types of complex networks .",
    "the examples include social networks @xcite , power transmission grids @xcite , communication systems @xcite , and road infrastructures @xcite .",

    "the efficient immunization against the epidemic spreading of diseases and strategies for failure prevention are important topics with many practical implications in real systems .",
    "scientists have recently demonstrated the benefits of targeted @xcite and acquaintance immunization @xcite in scale - free networks , have studied the applicability of `` flooding '' dissemination strategies based only on local information @xcite , and have proposed efficient strategies for eliminating cascading effects in networks @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these works we would like focus on interdependent systems and on the spreading dynamics of disastrous events between the networked components .",
    "disastrous events are bothering mankind from the earliest days .",
    "the ability to recover the functionality of damaged infrastructures promptly is crucial for survival and determines , whether the affected areas will overcome the consequences of catastrophe or not .",
    "emergency response and recovery call for external resources , which are limited and , therefore , have to be deployed as efficiently as possible",
    ". the question how to effectively distribute resources in order to fight disasters best has already been addressed by many researchers . as examples ,",
    "we mention the redistribution of medical material @xcite , the mitigation of large - scale forest fires @xcite , and the fighting of floods @xcite .",
    "an experimental study of disasters under real world conditions is almost impossible , and therefore , mathematical and computer models are often very helpful tools to extend human knowledge",
    ". however , the complexity of systems struck by disasters does not allow one to model the interactions of all involved entities and processes in detail .",
    "therefore , we have to capture them by an appropriate generic model .",
    "disastrous events are often characterized by cascading failures @xcite propagating in the system due to the causal dependencies between system components .",
    "these casual dependencies result from structural and functional interdependencies and can be modeled by directed networks .",
    "note that there were several attempts to quantify such networks for particular cases , using interaction network approaches @xcite or fuzzy cognitive maps @xcite .",
    "loops in these networks are crucial , since the amplification of negative effects through the loops may considerably deteriorate the situation .",
    "such loops are sometimes called `` vicious circles '' .",
    "the above mentioned view of disasters has led us to the formulation of a general spreading model of failures in networks @xcite . to assess the importance of the availability of information about the network on the efficiency of disaster recovery , in this paper we will study the effect of different protection strategies .",
    "these strategies are based on different information evaluation and control the distribution of resources over the system components . as parameters in our model , we consider the overall quantity of resources @xmath0 , the recovery time delay @xmath1 , and the network topology @xmath2 .",
    "as our simulations did not give qualitatively different results for varying link weights @xmath2 , we will not discuss the case of heterogeneous network links in this paper .",

    "our paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] presents our mathematical model of disaster spreading . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mob ] , we describe the mobilization process of resources . disaster recovery modeling issues and protection strategies are discussed in sec .",

    "[ sec : res ] . to conclude this paper , sec .",
    "[ sec : con ] summarizes the most important findings and outlines possible directions of future research .",
    "in this section , we briefly summarize our model of disaster spreading originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model is based on a graph @xmath3 of interconnected system components @xmath4 .",
    "the directed links @xmath5 , with @xmath6 , represent structural and functional dependencies between the components .",
    "the state of a node @xmath7 at time @xmath8 is described by a continuous variable @xmath9 , where @xmath10 corresponds to a normal functioning of the component .",
    "the deviation from this state , caused by disturbances , represents the level of challenge of system component @xmath7 . at the present stage of abstraction",
    ", we do not consider diverse functionalities of the components and we assume an additive impact of external disturbances coming from neighboring components .",
    "each real system exhibits a natural level of resistance to challenges .",
    "we reflect this tolerance by a special threshold @xmath11 and assume that a node tends to fail , when the sum of all disturbances acting on it exceeds this value @xcite . rather than by a discontinuous step function we describe this by the sigmoidal function    @xmath12},\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is a `` gain parameter '' .    the interactions between the components are quantified by the connection strengths @xmath2 and by the link transmission time delays @xmath14 .",
    "the overall dynamics of a node is then given by :    @xmath15    where the first term on the right - hand side models the ability of component @xmath7 to recover from perturbations and the second term describes the superposition of all pertubative influences by adjacent nodes @xmath16 on node @xmath7 . if @xmath17 , the recovery term tends to drive @xmath18 back to zero .",
    "the recovery rate @xmath19 characterizes the speed of the recovery process at node @xmath20 .",
    "the function @xmath21 introduces an additional weight to reflect that the impact of highly connected neighboring nodes is smaller , because their influence is distributed among many nodes and in this way `` dissipated '' @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 is the out - degree of node @xmath16 while @xmath23 and @xmath24 are fit parameters .",
    "the disturbances , as they are transmitted over the links , can be strengthened or weakened by different factors like for instance the time delays or physical properties of the surrounding . the intensity of this process can , in our model , be controlled by the parameter @xmath25 . in the experiments",
    "we have used @xmath26 , which corresponds to relatively weak damping of disturbances on links .",
    "our simulation studies were performed for four types of directed networks representing different systems .",
    "specifically , we have studied networks such as regular ( grid ) networks , random networks , scale - free networks , and small - world networks .    only regular ( grid ) networks were specified with bidirectional links .",
    "the directed scale - free networks were generated using the algorithm by bollobs , borgs , chayes , and riordan @xcite , where the attachment of new node is controlled by probabilities @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath30 and by non - negative parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these parameters have been set to @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "small - world networks have been generated using the procedure described in ref .",
    "this procedure slightly generalized the generation of _ undirected _ small - world graphs proposed by watts and strogatz @xcite : in contrast to their original algorithm , we have randomly assigned directions to links , with probabilities for clockwise and counter - clockwise direction of 0.3 each , while a bidirectional link has been assumed with probability 0.4 . finally , a random rewiring procedure with rewiring probability @xmath38 has been applied .",
    "in addition , we have generated random networks of the erds - rnyi type .",
    "all networks have been generated in a way that the resulting average node degree was approximately 3.6 .",
    "the grid network was organized in 25 rows each containing 20 nodes .    throughout this paper , all computer - generated networks are composed of 500 nodes . moreover",
    ", our homogeneous parameter settings assume that all @xmath39 and all @xmath40 , where a link from node @xmath7 to @xmath16 exists , otherwise @xmath41 .",
    "the time delays @xmath42 are @xmath43-distributed , where we have chosen @xmath44 for the number of degrees freedom of the @xmath43-function .",
    "however , the distribution was stretched multiplying by factor 0.05 and shifted by adding the value 1.2 in order to get an average delay of @xmath45 .",
    "let us assume that the emergency forces and all material flows are entering the affected area continuously in time .",
    "this process can be modeled by a continuous function , which defines , how much resources have reached an affected area at time @xmath8 .",
    "the shape of this function is an essential point of our model , because the prompt mobilization of resources a has strong influence on the efficiency of countermeasures @xcite . despite the frequent occurrence of disasters",
    ", we found only a few publications that provide a detailed information about the progress of mobilization in time .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] shows the manpower and vehicles , which were involved in the recovery activities to fight the elbe river flooding in germany in august 2002 @xcite .",
    "both curves are quantitatively similar and can be well approximated using the function @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are fit parameters .",
    "the mobilization itself is represented by the growing part of the curve . to reflect the progress of mobilization of external resources in our simulations",
    ", we have used the approximate fit curve for manpower .",
    "besides time progress of the mobilization , further important parameters are the overall quantity of external resources @xmath0 and the response time @xmath50 .",
    "the response time is the time interval between the occurrence of the initial disastrous event and the first provision of resources .",
    "the resources used for the recovery are assumed to be distributed in time according to the manpower data presented in fig .",
    "1 . we have normalized the magnitude of this curve according the total amount of resources @xmath0 , keeping its shape .",
    "the time period during which the distribution of resources takes place was set to half of the simulation time horizon , i.e. @xmath51 time steps .    .",
    "the best fit parameters for manpower ( top ) are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , while for vehicles ( bottom ) they are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=38.0% ] .",
    "the best fit parameters for manpower ( top ) are @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , while for vehicles ( bottom ) they are @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=38.0% ]",
    "disasters come mostly unexpected , and the first moments after their occurrence are characterized by a high uncertainty in the estimation of the overall impact .",
    "crisis management coordinates the work of all emergency units and often has to take decisions based on scarce information .",
    "this requires a reliable organization in term of information flows @xcite , their evaluation and the choice of appropriate respose strategies .    to uncover what information is most important for efficient disaster response , we study here the properties of several recovery strategies , allocating the resources to components based on different information . as first kind of information ,",
    "let us consider the knowledge of the component s connectivity , i.e. the out - degrees and in - degrees of the nodes .",
    "this information allows one to uncover those components , which influence most other components and those which are easily vulnerable , because they have many in - going links . as second kind of information",
    "we assume that the locations and seriousness of malfunctions in the network are well - known .",
    "this information reflects the current level of node damage and allows one to prioritize the nodes which are more seriously damaged .",
    "considering these two kinds of information , we have formulated the following recovery strategies @xmath58 :    * _ uniform dissemination _ , i.e. each node gets the same amount of resources , * _ out - degree based dissemination _ ,",
    "i.e. the resources are distributed over nodes proportionally to their out - degrees , * _ uniform reinforcement of challenged nodes _ , i.e. all nodes @xmath59 with @xmath60 are equally provided with resources , * _ simple targeted reinforcement of destroyed nodes _ , i.e. damaged nodes ( @xmath61 ) are equally provided with resources with priority , while challenged nodes ( @xmath62 ) are uniformly reinforced if no damaged nodes exist , * _ simple targeted reinforcement of highly connected nodes _ , i.e. a fraction @xmath63 of highly connected nodes is uniformly provided with resources by using the fraction @xmath64 of all resources , while the remaining resources are applied according to strategy @xmath65 , * _ out - degree based targeted reinforcement of destroyed nodes _ , i.e. application of strategy @xmath65 , but with a distribution of resources proportional to the out - degrees of nodes rather than a uniform distribution .",
    "equation ( [ eq : node ] ) represents the mitigation activities in the nodes by the recovery rates @xmath66 .",
    "it models a situation without additional external forces sent to challenged system components to perform mitigation actions .",
    "thus , at the beginning it is assumed that the mitigation activities are weak ( @xmath67 ) , because they are based only on internal resources . if these internal resources are not sufficient to cope with the evolving disaster , external resources have to be mobilized .",
    "the assignment of external resources to a node is assumed to increase the recovery rate @xmath68 of a node according to    @xmath69    our model assumes that , once resources have been assigned to a node , they will remain at the selected node and are not reassigned again . in eq .",
    "( [ eq : healing ] ) , the cumulative amount of resources assigned to node @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath70 .",
    "the formula reflects the fact that each new unit of resources has a smaller effect than the previous one , which is due to the decreasing efficiency of recovery activities , when the concentration of forces grows .",
    "these effects are well - known and may be explained by increasing efforts for communication and the coordination of forces .",
    "the influence of this effect is represented by the fit parameter @xmath71 .",
    "the parameter @xmath72 defines an upper bound of the recovery rate .    when developing formula ( [ eq : healing ] ) , we have required the following :    1 .",
    "resources have only positive influence on the state of the node . in other words ,",
    "the function @xmath19 should grow monotonously with the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "2 .   when there are no resources applied in node @xmath7 i.e. , @xmath73 , then @xmath74 .",
    "3 .   finally , we expect a limited speed of recovery process .",
    "in fact , for @xmath75 we have @xmath76 .",
    "formula ( [ eq : healing ] ) obeys all three conditions , and we expect qualitatively similar results for all continuous functions satisfying these conditions .",
    "we have extensively studied the properties of protection strategies by means of computer simulations . due to the existence of random parameters , such as @xmath42 , the results of the simulation experiments varied with the realizations of the random variables .",
    "experiments started at time @xmath77 , when the @xmath18 variable of one randomly selected node @xmath7 was set to the value @xmath1 for 10 time units .",
    "figure [ fig : damage ] shows an example how the average number of damaged nodes than develops in the course of time .",
    "the existence of hubs causes that the perturbation propagates much faster in scale - free networks than in grids , but on the other hand , the protection strategies work more efficiently , when they can focus on these highly connected nodes . to assess the behavior of our model ,",
    "we have evaluated the most unpleasant scenario , which occurs when we consider the most unfriendly realization of the random parameters .",
    "one possible characteristics , which reflects this `` worst - case '' scenario , is the dependence of the minimal quantity of resources @xmath78 required to recover the network on the response time delay @xmath50 .",
    "it defines a success threshold for each considered strategy . except for this",
    ", we have evaluated the average damage of the respective network .",

    "[ fig : rmin ] ) we observe two basic types of behavior : within the studied range of response time delays @xmath50 , the values of @xmath78 are either growing , or they stay approximately constant . if they are growing with @xmath88 , the resources are sufficient to repair the network before the failures affected the whole network . in the region where @xmath78 does not change significantly with increasing @xmath88 ,",
    "damage spreads all over the network .",
    "therefore , the resources required to restore the failure - free state of the network are always the same .",
    "our data show the highest spreading velocity for scale - free networks and the slowest spreading for regular grids .",
    "the erds - rnyi and small - world networks are somewhere in between and the transition point between the growing and the constant part of @xmath90 represents the critical value of @xmath50 beyond which failures paralyze the complete network .",
    "small - world networks and , to some degree , scale - free networks as well show a decrease of @xmath78 for large values of the response delay time @xmath88 , which is surprising ( see fig . [",
    "fig : rmin ] , strategy @xmath80 ) .",
    "this decrease indicates the unbalanced distribution of resources , where there is a surplus of resources in some nodes and a deficit elsewhere .",
    "the relationship between the velocity of failure propagation and resources mobilization is crucial for damage - based protection strategies .",
    "the spreading velocity is increased by the existence of a small - world effect , which is based on the existence of long - range links ( shortcuts ) . over these shortcuts , failures spread very fast to distant parts of the network .",
    "consequently , the resources must be distributed over a large area .",
    "however , if @xmath50 is small , they are deployed less uniformly , because the majority of resources is deployed during the time when only a small part of the network is affected by failures . in such situations , we can find groups of interconnected nodes , which have been less provided with resources .",
    "later on , these nodes require an additional effort to be repaired .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath50 is large , the resources are distributed more uniformly and the overall demanded quantity of resources is smaller .    in practice , this calls for a precise assessment of the propagation velocity and mobilization rates , which is possible only when the eventually occurring damages can be identified in advance .",
    "taking into account information about the network structure , which determines the possible sequence of failure occurrence , this problem can be significantly reduced ( see fig .",

    "when we fix the amount of resources @xmath0 and vary @xmath50 , the damage @xmath105 is typically distributed in the way shown in fig .",

    "the recovery process is able to repair the network in a very short time ( dashed line ) . for intermediate values of @xmath88 two distinct situations",

    "is still repaired , but much later , than for small values of @xmath88 .",
    "thus , for intermediate response time delays we can expect a big discrepancy between the damage in the best and the worst case scenario .",
    "this behavior strongly reminds of the initial phase of real disasters , where an apparently irrelevant event like a small social conflict , a thrown cigarette or a delayed disposal of waste can , under similar conditions , either vanish without any significant impact or trigger riots , forest fires or epidemics .            in order to answer the question which strategies are more proper for which kinds of networks , we have compared the average damage @xmath105 for a matrix of parameter combinations ( with @xmath107 and @xmath108 ) . as",

    "the overall results of our comparison can be summarized as follows : if we have the option to choose whether to orient the disaster recovery strategy at the network structure or at the current damage , then , regular grids with a small spreading velocity are protected best by strategies reacting to the level of damage . in contrast , for scale - free networks it is more effective to take the network structure into account .",
    "the choice of the proper strategy for erds- rnyi and small - world structures depends on the response time delay . for short time delays",
    ", there is a good chance to reduce the spreading by preferential protection of damaged nodes , but when the time delay is large and many nodes have already been affected , the damage is minimized by protection of nodes with high out - degrees .",
    "disaster recovery and the operation of inter - connected infrastructures involve an intricate decision making where each action can invoke a variety of hardly predictable reactions .",
    "here the network type plays an important role , and the theory of complex systems and the statistical physics of networks offer powerful methods .",

    "we have considered the overall quantity of resources @xmath0 and the response time delay @xmath88 . by means of simulations ,",
    "we have determined the minimum disposition of resources , which is necessary to stop disaster spreading and recover from it .",
    "the behavior of scale - free networks was found to be ambiguous . in comparison with other network structures ,",
    "the highest quantity of resources for recovery is needed in case of small response time delays , while the required disposition of resources is smallest for large time delays .",
    "when the response time delay and disposition of resources are within reasonable limits , the optimization of protection strategies has the largest effect .",
    "furthermore , strategies oriented at the network structure are efficient for scale - free networks , while strategies based on the damage are more appropriate for regular grid networks .",
    "the suitable strategy for erds - rnyi and small - world networks depends on the response time delay . in case of short time delays ,",
    "the damage reduction is higher for damage - based strategies , whereas strategies oriented at information about the network structure are better for large response time delays .",
    "therefore , we expect that the properties of response strategies could be further improved by switching between different strategies in time . this will be a subject of our forthcoming investigations .",

    "the function @xmath109 is motivated by the assumption that the impact of highly connected nodes is distributed among many neighboring nodes and , therefore , may decrease with the outdegree @xmath22 . a simple linear dependence would be more appropriate in cases , when the spreading depends on the transmission of some conserved quantity like , for example , in electrical circuits or in road traffic .",
    "however , in some cases the spreading does not obey any conservation law , as for the spreading of forest conflagrations or epidemics .",
    "since we do not consider any concrete scenario in this paper , we decided to use a formula that is more general than a linear function .",
    "other decaying functions in @xmath22 are expected to have qualitatively similar effects .",
