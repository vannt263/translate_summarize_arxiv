    "recently there has been an increasing interest in the networks of randomly distributed stick ( rodlike ) particles  @xcite , due to the development in the area of conductive nanoparticles , such as the carbon nanotubes , silicon , copper , and silver nanowires  @xcite , and the promising applications in electronics  @xcite , optoelectronics  @xcite , and sensors  @xcite .",
    "the conventional electronic composites containing stick particles as a filler can be used as a conducting channel in the thin - film network configurations  @xcite . probably , the most important characteristics of the stick networks , are the conductivity , either electric  @xcite or thermal  @xcite .",
    "the conductivity dependence on the stick density and system geometry needs to be taken into account in any device design  @xcite .",
    "the percolation models  @xcite are often used to model an onset of the high electrical conductivity in the composites consisting of the conductive sticks in the insulating matrices  @xcite .",
    "the percolation theory predicts that the electrical conductivity of the composite materials with the conductive filler density @xmath0 above , but close to the percolation threshold @xmath1 , increases with the density by a power scaling law @xmath2 , with the universal conductivity exponent @xmath3 for two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems  @xcite .",
    "while the conductivity scaling law is expected to be applicable only near the percolation threshold , in many experiments the scaling law was used over a much larger range of concentration , but with the nonuniversal values of the conductivity exponent  @xcite .",

    "@xcite obtained the nonuniversal value @xmath4 for the conductivity exponent using the conductivity scaling law for fitting the experimental data for ultrathin carbon nanotube networks operating from the percolation threshold up to about ten times the percolation threshold density .",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated that the universal power law holds from the percolation threshold @xmath1 , to about twice its value @xmath5 . for higher stick density , @xmath6 , and in two",
    "limiting cases they observed that the conductivity scaling exponent becomes : ( i ) slightly higher than @xmath7 when the junctions are superconductive and only the stick conductance is the limiting factor for the current flow through the system and ( ii ) close to @xmath8 when the sticks are superconductive and the contact conductance is the limiting factor .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the conductivity exponent significantly varies with the junction - to - stick conductance ratio for lower stick densities up to @xmath5 .",
    "the broad range applicability of the conductivity scaling law was explained by the presence of the long - range correlations in the distribution of the conductive sticks in the system  @xcite .",
    "we will demonstrate that the nonuniversality of the conductivity exponents is a consequence of a transition from the percolating to dense stick networks .    in this paper",
    ", we numerically investigate the conductivity of the stick systems from the percolation threshold up to ten times the percolation threshold density .",
    "we show that it is not appropriate to use a simple scaling law to describe the conductivity dependence on the density both for finite and dense systems . based on the monte carlo simulation results ,",
    "a model is proposed describing the conductivity dependence on the stick density and the different junction - to - stick conductance ratios .",
    "the proposed model is valid for the different stick - like nanoparticles ( e.g. , the carbon nanotubes and the nanowires ) .",
    "the model is motivated by the observed structural characteristic ( i.e. , the density of the total sticks and contacts involved in the current flow through the system ) .",
    "the finite - size effects , especially pronounced in the vicinity of the percolation threshold , are included in the generic description for the conductivity of stick systems .",
    "monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are coupled with an efficient iterative algorithm implemented on the grid platform and used to investigate the conductivity of stick systems  @xcite .",
    "we have considered the two - dimensional systems with isotropically placed widthless sticks of length @xmath9 .",
    "the centers of the sticks are randomly positioned and oriented inside the square system with size @xmath10 .",
    "two electrodes ( i.e. , conducting bars ) are placed at the left and right sides .",
    "the top and bottom boundaries of the system are free and nonconducting .",
    "the free boundary conditions are more consistent with the finite - size rodlike nanoparticle networks in practice  @xcite .",
    "two sticks lie in the same cluster if they intersect .",
    "the system percolates ( conduct ) if the electrodes are connected with the same cluster .",
    "the behavior of the stick percolation is studied in terms of the stick density @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the total number of sticks and @xmath13 is the normalized system size .",
    "the percolation threshold of the infinite system is defined by the critical density @xmath14 ( refs .",
    "@xcite ) . to evaluate the conductivity of the stick systems we introduce two different conductances : ( 1 ) the conductance of the entire stick @xmath15 and ( 2 ) the conductance due to the stick - to - stick junction @xmath16 .",
    "we assume diffusive electrical transport through the stick typical for the rodlike nanostructures ( carbon nanotubes and nanowires ) whose length is larger than the mean free path of the electrons  @xcite .",
    "according to the diffusive electrical transport the electrical resistance of a stick segment is proportional to the length of the segment  @xcite . in our simulations ,",
    "each stick - stick junction is modeled by an effective contact conductance regardless of the type of the junction , following the simplified approach of the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite . therefore ,",
    "if two sticks intersect a junction with the fixed conductance @xmath16 is created at the intersection point .",
    "if a stick intersects an electrode the potential of the electrode is applied to the intersection point .",
    "kirchhoff s current law was used to balance the current flow through each node of the created network .",
    "an iterative equation solver ( i.e. , conjugate gradient method with jacobi preconditioner ) has been employed to solve a large system of the linear equations following from the current law  @xcite . after obtaining the total current @xmath17 under an applied voltage @xmath18 the macroscopic electrical conductivity of the system",
    "is evaluated as @xmath19 ( ref .",
    "monte carlo simulations have been performed for a wide range ( i.e. , @xmath20 to @xmath21 ) of junction - to - stick conductance ratios ( cf .",
    "finally , for each set of the system parameters , the electrical conductivity is averaged over the @xmath22 independent mc realizations . to obtain the same precision for the finite - size systems @xmath23 realizations",
    "are used for the systems with normalized size @xmath24 down to @xmath25 for the largest system @xmath26 studied . using the appropriate functions for the fitting data and the least - squares fitting methodology  @xcite , good fits with high correlation factors ( @xmath27 )",
    "were obtained for all analyzed systems .",
    "as already mentioned , the numerical estimates of the conductivity exponent @xmath28 are based on the linear fit of the mc results for the logarithms of the conductivity @xmath29 and density @xmath30 ( refs  @xcite ) .",
    "the estimates therefore rely on the assumption that @xmath29 obeys the simple power - law dependence over a quite extended density range .",
    "as there exists no justification of such an assumption , we have investigated in detail the sbehavior of the conductivity @xmath29 as we move away from the critical point .",
    "a local ( density dependent ) conductivity exponent is defined as @xmath31 by  @xcite @xmath32 the dependence of the local conductivity exponent @xmath31 on the stick density @xmath0 and the ratio of the stick - stick junction conductance ( @xmath16 ) to stick conductance ( @xmath15 ) ( i.e. , @xmath33 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] . as one can see from a coarse observation , when the stick density approaches the percolation threshold @xmath1 from above the local conductivity exponent converges to the universal value for 2d systems @xmath34 for all @xmath33 values .",
    "the fine behavior of the local conductivity exponent for finite - size systems in the vicinity of the percolation threshold will be discussed later in this section . with the increasing concentration @xmath0 , the local conductivity exponents @xmath31 change quickly from the universal value @xmath35 , taking the values in a wide range @xmath36 . from fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] , one can see that the local conductivity exponents @xmath31 for the conductance ratio higher than 2 ( @xmath37 ) is a monotonically decreasing function of the stick density @xmath0 which converges to 1 from above .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , for the conductance ratios lower than 1 ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) , the local exponent @xmath31 is not a monotonic function and has a local maximum .",
    "the observed density where the local conductivity exponent reaches a maximum is decreasing with the conductance ratio @xmath33 .    to explain the observed behavior of the exponent @xmath31 at the higher densities @xmath39 , one needs to look into the structure of the dense conducting stick systems .",
    "figure  [ figure_2 ] shows the densities of the sticks @xmath40 and junctions @xmath41 that carry the current through the system . for sufficiently high stick densities ( @xmath39 )",
    ", one can see that almost all the sticks and junctions in the system contribute to the conductivity and that the density of the current - carrying junctions increases with the stick density @xmath0 by a square power law @xmath42 .",
    "the reason for this is that the mean number of contacts per stick is proportional to the stick density , see ref .",
    "@xcite . also , for a sufficiently high stick density @xmath0 the current - carrying stick density @xmath40 is proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , when the stick density is well above the percolation threshold @xmath1 , the conductivity of the system can be modeled as an equivalent serial conductance @xmath0 sticks in parallel and @xmath43 junctions in parallel @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant parameter .",
    "one can see that the square term @xmath46 , originating from the junctions , converges faster to zero than the linear term @xmath47 .",
    "this explains the conductivity exponent @xmath31 approaching to 1 when the stick density is sufficiently high ( i.e. , @xmath48 ) and the existence of the local exponent maximum in fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] . if the sticks are much more conductive than the junctions ( e.g. , @xmath49 ) the density where the local conductivity exponent starts to converge to 1 is high and computationally unreachable in the mc simulations shown in fig .",
    "[ figure_1 ] . only in the limiting case when the sticks are superconductive and the conductance ratio approaches zero , i.e. , @xmath50 , should the conductivity exponent @xmath31 converge to 2 with the increasing density @xmath0 , which is consistent with keblinski _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in the other limit , when the junctions are superconductive ( i.e. , @xmath51 ) the local conductivity exponent @xmath31 should have the fastest convergence to 1 .    at the densities close to the percolation threshold @xmath1 , only a fraction but not all the sticks and junctions in the system",
