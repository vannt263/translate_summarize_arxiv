    "let us begin by reviewing the well - known self - duality in the toric code  @xcite , the quantum double model based on the @xmath10 group .",
    "this is a model of qubits along the bonds of a @xmath1 lattice @xmath11 ( the dimension of the local hilbert spaces being the size of the group ) , with a hamiltonian of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 runs over vertices and @xmath14 runs over plaquettes of @xmath11 . mutually commuting vertex and plaquette operators are projectors involving pauli matrices : @xmath15 with support on the bonds around the corresponding vertex or plaquette .",
    "self - duality means that , upon a global unitary @xmath16 built from hadamard maps on each edge @xmath17 , the toric code on @xmath11 gets mapped to a toric code on the dual lattice @xmath18 : @xmath19 where now @xmath20 corresponds to dual plaquette @xmath13 , and @xmath21 to dual vertex @xmath14 in @xmath18 .",
    "ground states of the frustration - free hamiltonian  ( [ generic_hamiltonian ] ) minimise each term in the sum , that is , they satisfy all vertex and plaquette constraints @xmath22 , @xmath23 . breakdown of any one such constraint means the state is in an excited level , and can be interpreted as the presence of a localised excitation , or particle , sitting at the vertex or plaquette that is broken ; from the gauge theory interpretation , these are called electric and magnetic excitations .",
    "the electric - magnetic nature of duality  ( [ hadamard_for_toric_code ] ) comes then from the interchange of vertices and plaquettes in going from the original to the dual lattice .",
    "hidden in the action of the global hadamard map @xmath24 are , first , the mapping from @xmath11 to the dual lattice and the corresponding reinterpretation of vertex and plaquette operators , and second , a mapping of elements of the group @xmath10 to the functions from this group to the scalars .",
    "if we obtain again a toric code in the dual lattice it is because , for an _ abelian _ group , the space of functions has the same structure as the group algebra , which is the space of linear combinations of group elements .",
    "one can exploit this algebraic fact to extend the self - duality of the toric code to all @xmath2 models for abelian groups in a straightforward way : this is the @xmath3 region of figure  [ fig : dualities ] .    for general @xmath2 models , we start with a lattice with oriented bonds , whose hilbert spaces have an orthonormal basis @xmath25 labelled by elements of a finite group @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the @xmath2 model is still of the form  ( [ generic_hamiltonian ] ) , but now the mutually commuting vertex and plaquette operators are the projectors defined in figure  [ fig : vertexplaquettedg ] .     * projectors in the @xmath2 model . *",
    "vertex ( @xmath27 ) and plaquette ( @xmath28 ) projectors in the hamiltonian of kitaev s @xmath2 model are defined by their action on a basis of the corresponding multi - edge hilbert space .",
    "oriented edges are labelled by group elements denoting kets in the orthonormal computational basis @xmath29 ; change of orientation is implemented by applying the inversion map @xmath30 .",
    "the vertex operator projects onto gauge - invariant configurations ( = symmetrises over simultaneous multiplication with group elements ) .",
    "the plaquette operator involves a kronecker delta on the unit element @xmath31 and projects onto trivial magnetic flux across @xmath14 . ]",
    "the obvious parallelism of plaquettes and vertices in the abelian case is lost if @xmath26 is non - abelian . upon switching to the dual lattice",
    ", we can not reinterpret the operators @xmath27 and @xmath28 as plaquette and vertex operators in a quantum double model based on a group , since the functions on a non - abelian group cease to have the same structure as the group algebra itself .",
    "hence , the extension of the em duality to non - abelian groups is not possible within the class of quantum doubles based on groups .",
    "yet the construction of the abelian duality can be generalised to the non - abelian case , resulting in dual models which are no longer quantum double models based on groups , but rather quantum double models based on algebras of functions ; this is shown as the arrow between the regions @xmath2 and @xmath32 in figure  [ fig : dualities ] . to make sense of this , one has to widen the construction of quantum double lattice models beyond the group case .",
    "as we will show , the natural habitat for the em duality of @xmath33 models is the class of quantum double models based on _ hopf algebras _",
    "@xcite ; this is the region  @xmath34 in figure  [ fig : dualities ] .",
    "this is the smallest setting containing all @xmath2 models and closed under tensor products and em duality ; the latter , moreover , takes a remarkably simple form in the language of hopf algebras .",
    "when studying quantum many - body systems , more general notions of symmetry emerge than those furnished by group theory .",
    "in particular , linear transformations acting on tensor products of vector spaces lead naturally to hopf algebras . for a detailed account of these in our context",
    "we refer to  @xcite . in the following we give an intuitive grasp of their structure , which is necessary to understand the @xmath34 lattice models .",
    "we consider hopf algebras @xmath35 as spaces of transformations on a many - body hilbert space .",
    "first of all , the linear nature of the target is naturally extended to its transformations , so hopf algebras are vector spaces .",
    "we must be able to compose transformations and to include the identity transformation , so @xmath35 has a multiplication of vectors , and a unit .",
    "most importantly , we must have a rule to _ distribute _ the action of an element of @xmath35 into a tensor product of target spaces ; this is the so - called comultiplication .",
    "additionally @xmath35 has a trivial representation @xmath36 , called counit , making precise the notion of spaces invariant under the action of @xmath35 . like for groups ,",
    "the representation theory of hopf algebras includes a notion of conjugate representation , implemented via an antipode mapping , which for groups is just the inversion @xmath37 .    in order to construct hilbert spaces , we use hopf @xmath9-algebras , which in addition have an inner product .",
    "we will only consider finite - dimensional hopf @xmath9-algebras , which come equipped with a canonical , highly symmetric element , the _ haar integral _",
    "@xmath38 , invariant under multiplication in the sense @xmath39 for all elements @xmath40 of @xmath35 .",
    "this canonical element is crucial for the construction of the lattice model and its ground states .",
    "* structure and dualities in hopf algebras . *",
    "the _ first row _ represents the structure maps of a hopf algebra @xmath35 .",
    "solid lines represent elements of @xmath35 , and dotted lines represent scalars in @xmath41 .",
    "the _ second and third rows _ illustrate the algebraic duality within the class of hopf algebras , taking as examples a group algebra @xmath42 and its dual @xmath43 , whose structure is defined implicitly in the figure . for each diagram , the upper expression is equal to the lower expression ; the structure maps of @xmath35 and @xmath43 are represented by solid and dashed lines , respectively , according to the conventions of the first row .",
    "hence , the multiplication in @xmath43 is determined by the comultiplication in @xmath35 , the unit in @xmath43 is determined by the counit in @xmath43 , etc . ; this duality holds for general finite - dimensional hopf algebras .",
    "we use the form of the structure maps in the basis @xmath44 of the group algebra , and the basis @xmath45 of its dual , where @xmath46 are kronecker delta functions . as for the extra structure needed to define our lattice models ,",
    "the @xmath9-algebra structures of @xmath35 and @xmath43 are defined by declaring @xmath47 to be an orthonormal basis , and @xmath48 to be orthonormal up to a factor , @xmath49 .",
    "the haar integrals @xmath50 and @xmath51 in the group algebra and its dual are defined in equation  ( [ haargroups ] ) . ]",
    "the root of the em duality to be unveiled in the following is an algebraic fact : _ the class of hopf @xmath9-algebras is closed under dualisation_. that is , given a hopf @xmath9-algebra @xmath35 , its dual space @xmath43 of _ functions _ from @xmath35 to the scalars is again a hopf @xmath9-algebra , whose structure is , moreover , determined by the structure of @xmath35 , as illustrated by figure  [ fig : hopf ] .",
    "this closure property is shared by the class of abelian group algebras ( which are all self - dual ) , but not for the whole class of group algebras .",
    "the landscape of figure  [ fig : dualities ] reflects these statements in the world of lattice models .     *",
    "the core of @xmath52 models*. topological models based on hopf algebras are defined via these vertex and plaquette representations of @xmath53 and @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "oriented edges carry , in general , elements of a finite - dimensional hopf @xmath9-algebra @xmath35 ; for kitaev s models , take @xmath35 to be the group algebra @xmath55 .",
    "orientation can be reversed by using the antipode map @xmath0 referred to in the text .",
    "the sums denote the appropriate _ comultiplication _ or splitting of algebra elements into several tensor factors .",
    "vertex operators @xmath56 now depend also on a plaquette @xmath14 marking the beginning of a loop around the vertex @xmath13 , and correspondingly for the plaquettes .",
    "these operators probe the algebraic structure of the models : given @xmath13 and @xmath14 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 interact nontrivially , building representations of drinfeld s _ quantum double _ algebra @xmath34",
    "the irreducible representations of @xmath34 classify the superselection sectors , and thus the anyonic structure of excitations , of the quantum double lattice models  @xcite . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : vertexplaquettedh ] defines a set of operators on a lattice whose bonds carry elements of  @xmath35 , a finite - dimensional hopf @xmath9-algebra .",
    "these operators depend on elements of the algebra and its dual , respectively .",
    "when these are taken as the haar integrals @xmath50 of @xmath35 and @xmath51 of @xmath43 , the resulting operators @xmath59 define via  ( [ generic_hamiltonian ] ) the hamiltonian of a topological lattice model : the quantum double model based on @xmath35 , or @xmath34 model for short  @xcite .",
    "kitaev s models are a particular subclass of @xmath34 models , recovered when @xmath35 is the group algebra of a finite group @xmath26 .",
    "both this algebra @xmath60 and its dual @xmath61 have particularly simple hopf @xmath9-algebra structures , summarised in figure  [ fig : hopf ] .",
    "in particular , their haar integrals read @xmath62 taking into account this equation , operators in figure  [ fig : vertexplaquettedg ] , defining the hamiltonian of the @xmath2 model , can be checked to coincide with the general expression  ( [ ophamiltdh ] ) .",
    "we now define em duality for general @xmath34 models . consider the following unitary map @xmath63 from @xmath35 to its dual : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the dimension of @xmath35 , and the function @xmath66",
    "is constructed via the dual haar integral @xmath67 ( for instance , for groups , @xmath68 ) .",
    "we associate this mapping with the transformation of @xmath11 into its dual lattice @xmath18 as shown in figure  [ fig : dualbondvar ] .     *",
    "going over to the dual lattice*. the mapping @xmath69 is here interpreted as a lattice dualisation .",
    "the solid bond is in @xmath11 , while the dashed bond is its dual in @xmath18 .",
    "the orientation of the dual edge is chosen by convention so that it points to the left of the direct edge .",
    "the degree of freedom @xmath70 in the hilbert space @xmath35 of the bond in @xmath11 becomes a degree of freedom @xmath66 of the hilbert space @xmath43 of the dual bond .",
    "when applied simultaneously on all edges of @xmath11 , this mapping implements em duality . ]    the vertex and plaquette representations in figure  [ fig : vertexplaquettedh ] , associated with the @xmath71 model on @xmath11 , are mapped by @xmath72 into precisely the representations associated with the @xmath73 model on the dual lattice @xmath18",
    "@xcite : @xmath74 where @xmath14 is a plaquette of @xmath11 and a vertex of @xmath18 ; this expression generalises equation  ( [ hadamard_for_toric_code ] ) and identifies @xmath75 as the em duality mapping .",
    "thus , @xmath75 _ identifies _ the @xmath34 model on @xmath11 with the @xmath73 model on @xmath18 , as it transforms the hilbert spaces and hamiltonian of the former into those of the latter .",
    "we write this symbolically as @xmath76_\\lambda = [ \\mathrm{d } ( h^\\ast ) ] _ { \\lambda^\\ast } $ ] .",
    "but em duality is deeper than a mere identification of energy levels .",
    "the hamiltonian involves just the operators @xmath77 and @xmath78 , but , according to   ( [ maprepresentationstodual ] ) , @xmath75 induces a transformation of all operators of figure  [ fig : vertexplaquettedh ] that respects their algebra structure , and relates the anyonic excitations of both models  @xcite .",
    "we now make the connection with levin and wen s string - net models  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    "the @xmath2 model was identified , via a fourier mapping , with an _ extended _ string - net model on the same lattice , with bond degrees of freedom given by irreducible representations ( irreps ) of @xmath26 and auxiliary matrix indices depending on each irrep ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "string - net vertex conditions amount to knitting the matrix indices together by means of @xmath79 symbols , effectively mapping the local hilbert spaces isometrically to those of a levin - wen sn model , whose degrees of freedom and underlying category theoretical structure are given solely by irreps of @xmath26 and their fusion properties .",
    "the ground levels of sn and their extended versions are identical .",
    "now the representation theory of finite hopf @xmath9-algebras is essentially identical to that of finite groups ( the only real difference being that the fusion of representations need not be commutative ) .",
    "therefore the construction of  @xcite can be generalised immediately to any @xmath34 model .",
    "that is , if @xmath35 has matrix irreps @xmath80 of dimension @xmath81 , we define a basis in @xmath35 as @xmath82 =    \\sqrt { \\lvert h \\rvert \\lvert \\mu \\rvert } \\ ,",
    "\\sum _ { ( h ) }    d^\\mu _ { a b } ( h^{(1 ) } ) \\ ,    h^{(2 ) } \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath83 are matrix indices for irrep @xmath80 .",
    "this is an orthonormal basis for each bond , and the analysis of  @xcite carries through intact to show that the @xmath84_\\lambda$ ] model can be written as an extended string - net model @xmath85_\\lambda$ ] .",
    "the latter reduces to a string - net model @xmath86_\\lambda$ ] , whose degrees of freedom are the irreps of @xmath35 , and whose ground level is identical to that of the extended model .",
    "the same construction , as applied to the @xmath87 _ {    \\lambda^\\ast } $ ] model using the fourier basis for @xmath43 , yields an equivalent extended string - net @xmath88 _ {    \\lambda^\\ast } $ ] on the dual lattice .",
    "this , in turn , reduces to another string - net model @xmath89 _ {    \\lambda^\\ast } $ ] on the dual lattice , whose bond degrees of freedom are irreps of @xmath43 .",
    "we regard the two string - net models @xmath90_\\lambda$ ] and @xmath91 _ { \\lambda^\\ast } $ ] as the _ magnetic _ and _ electric _ projections of the original quantum double model ( see figure  [ fig : schememodels ] ) . by construction , they satisfy @xmath92 _",
    "{ \\lambda^\\ast } = [ \\mathrm{sn}^ {      \\mathrm{mag } } _ { h^\\ast } ] _ { \\lambda^\\ast } $ ] .     * from quantum doubles to string - nets . *",
    "quantum double models and string - net models are interconnected by em duality , the fourier mapping , and a projection to sn degrees of freedom .",
    "the direct lattice is drawn solid , the dual lattice dashed .",
    "the first layer represents the quantum double models in both their em - dual formulations . via the fourier mapping",
    "we write the quantum doubles as extended string - net models , depicted in the second layer , which are entirely equivalent .",
    "the degrees of freedom of the esn model on @xmath11 are labelled by irreducible representations @xmath93 of @xmath35 and auxiliary indices @xmath40 , @xmath94 ; for the dual model on @xmath18 the labels are irreducible representations @xmath95 of @xmath43 , and auxiliary indices @xmath96 , @xmath97 . these models support excitations both at vertices ( electric ) and at plaquettes ( magnetic ) , which we represent by blobs and lozenges . an electric excitation @xmath98 becomes a magnetic excitation @xmath99 in the dual , and viceversa .",
    "the third layer represents the sn models obtained , respectively , by projecting to degrees of freedom @xmath93 on the direct lattice , or @xmath100 on the dual lattice ; these we refer to as the magnetic and electric projections of the esn .",
    "excitations in sn models are less symmetric than in the esn : for instance , violation of a vertex constraint implies the violation of all surrounding plaquette constraints ( see  @xcite ) . ]    for instance , in  @xcite the magnetic sn projection of the @xmath2 model was analysed .",
    "its _ electric _ sn projection , on the other hand , has the same local degrees of freedom as the @xmath2 model , since group elements are the ( one - dimensional ) irreps of the dual of the group algebra  @xcite .",
    "thus , em duality can be given a meaning in the subclass of string - nets obtained by reduction of esns .",
    "this leads us to the following    _ conjecture _ :",
    "all sn models can be extended into quantum double models based on a sufficiently general algebraic structure , the class of weak hopf @xmath9-algebras @xcite@xcite .",
    "em duality can be defined for all extended sn models so that the pattern of figure  [ fig : schememodels ] holds .",
    "some physical consequences of em duality are immediate .",
    "first of all , em duality allows us to probe the topology of the surface underlying the lattice models by using only locally defined states .    as shown in  @xcite ,",
    "each @xmath84_\\lambda$ ] model has one canonical tensor network ground state @xmath101 constructed from _ identical _ tensors at each site , which are defined solely by the structure of @xmath35 .    from the corresponding canonical state @xmath102 of the dual @xmath103 _ {    \\lambda^\\ast } $ ] model on the dual lattice we can obtain another ground state of the original @xmath84_\\lambda$ ] model by using the duality map  ( [ emduality ] ) : @xmath104    the relation between @xmath105 and @xmath106 depends on the topology of the surface underlying @xmath11 . on the sphere , for instance , the ground level is nondegenerate , so both ground states are the same . on a topologically nontrivial surface such as the torus , these ground states can be shown to always be linearly independent .",
    "for instance , in the toric code the tensor network construction of the canonical state @xmath107 coincides with the _ projected entangled - pair state _ ( peps ) ansatz in  @xcite . on the torus this yields the logical @xmath108 state ;",
    "the dual ground state @xmath109 is the logical @xmath110 state .",
    "see  @xcite for a detailed construction , including the non - abelian cases .    on the other hand , the correspondence between string - net and quantum double models can be used to relate these peps to the tensor network descriptions of string - net ground states put forward in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "these come from the @xmath101 construction of the corresponding @xmath111_\\lambda$ ] model , while the @xmath112 can be seen to yield a _ new _ tn given simply by the knitting together of @xmath79 symbols at vertices in the esn degrees of freedom . more details will be given in  @xcite .",
    "the fourier construction is also expected to relate the _ entanglement renormalization _ analyses of @xmath34  @xcite and sn models  @xcite .",
    "we have defined em duality for non - abelian @xmath2 models , showing how it arises naturally in the context of @xmath34 models .",
    "the connection to sn models comes from the fourier construction of extended string - nets and their electric and magnetic projections .",
    "we conjecture that all sn models have extended versions , and that em duality can be defined for all the extended models .",
    "em duality offers nonlocal information about the systems , unveiling global characteristics of space , from tensor networks defined locally . beyond this",
    ", it serves as an _ organising principle _ for topological models ; indeed , we envisage a net of dualities for topological phases ( not unlike that connecting theories of strings and branes ) .",
    "this then reflects on the field theories underlying topological systems and on their mathematical structures , such as category theory .",
    "we wish to stress the importance of the _ whole class _ of models based on hopf algebras .",
    "this is indeed _ the _ natural class of models to study to understand electric - magnetic duality for lattice models based on non - abelian groups .",
    "we thus shift the focus away from lattice gauge theories based on groups , which are a primary concern in high energy theory , even when the hopf algebra language is applied  @xcite .",
    "ours is , moreover , the first proposal for a general em duality governing topologically ordered systems .",
    "the hopf algebraic language makes the em duality transparent and easy to grasp , instead of obscuring it ; in addition , this language can be learnt here hands - on from the standpoint of quantum many - body systems , which can even be built in a laboratory .",
    "we also provide , with the fourier construction , a way to understand some aspects of category theory in terms of representations , more familiar to many physicists .",
    "our next goal is defining the extended string - nets for all sn models  @xcite , casting esns and their dualities in the language of categories .",
    "the nature of the anyonic models controlling the excitations of the @xmath34 models has a bearing on the experimental realisation of string - net models , which we contend would be most natural in their  _ extended _ incarnations ( protocols for anyonic manipulation in the spirit of  @xcite and  @xcite would then be possible ) .",
    "a key question to be explored is the meaning of em upon perturbation of the models considered , that is , away from topological fixed points .",
