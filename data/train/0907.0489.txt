    "at a quantum phase transition , statics and dynamics of critical fluctuations are inseparably entangled .",
    "this is manifest in the dependence of static and thermodynamic properties on the dynamical exponent @xmath6 , that allows to associate a thermal length , @xmath7 , with temperature @xmath5 .",
    "this thermal length is at the origin of the quantum - to - classical crossover where critical fluctuations change their character.@xcite whereas critical bosonic modes with momenta higher than the inverse thermal length are of a quantum - mechanical nature , modes with smaller momenta behave effectively classical .",
    "this crossover also reveals itself in the phase diagram spanned by the control parameter of the quantum phase transition , @xmath8 , and temperature , @xmath5 .",
    "the behavior of , e.g. , thermodynamic properties changes qualitatively when the correlation length @xmath9 is of the same order as the thermal length @xmath10 .",
    "the identification of the critical fluctuations and their dynamics close to a putative quantum phase transition in a material is a nontrivial task .",
    "frequently , low - energy fluctuations characterized by different dynamics coexist and interact .",
    "in fact , this is generally the case in critical metals where the dynamics of the order parameter coexists with the dynamics of the fermionic quasiparticles .",
    "the standard hertz - millis - moriya model@xcite for a magnetic instability in a metal assumes that only the dynamics of the paramagnons is important for the characterization of critical properties .",
    "although this assumption has proved to be successful in interpreting a number of experiments , it has failed to explain consistently the properties of the heavy fermion compounds cecu@xmath11au@xmath12 and ybrh@xmath13si@xmath13.@xcite in particular , it has been argued that the latter system is characterized by the presence of multiple scales,@xcite that might be due to the presence of coexisting dynamics .",
    "theoretically , it is now established that the assumptions of the hertz - millis - moriya approach fail in the case of the ferromagnetic instability.@xcite the coupling of the ferromagnetic fluctuations to the fermionic degrees of freedom gives rise to singular corrections that prevent the formulation of an effective theory exclusively in terms of order - parameter fluctuations.@xcite the presence of multiple dynamics is also important for the antiferromagnetic quantum phase transition in metals in spatial dimension @xmath0 ; the fermions mediate an effectively long - ranged interaction among the paramagnons resulting in a strongly coupled theory with multiple dynamical scales.@xcite    although quantum criticality with multiple dynamical scales seems to be rather common , systematic investigations are rare and the generic features of this problem are therefore only poorly understood .",
    "the presence of coexisting dynamics and , consequently , different dynamical exponents complicates the analysis of experimental data considerably , as simple scaling relations are bound to fail . generally speaking ,",
    "different physical quantities might be dominated by one or the other dynamics such that the interpretation in terms of a single exponent @xmath6 results in apparent inconsistencies . on the theoretical side , a critical field theory with multiple exponents",
    "@xmath6 promises to exhibit a rich structure .",
    "the modes with the larger dynamical exponent @xmath14 have a larger phase space available and are thus expected to dominate , e.g. , the specific heat .",
    "the modes with the smaller exponent @xmath15 , on the other hand , have a smaller effective dimension @xmath16 and might therefore trigger infrared singularities in perturbative loop corrections .",
    "in addition , multiple dynamical exponents imply multiple thermal scales @xmath10 with the concomitant crossovers . instead of a single quantum - to - classical crossover",
    "one expects an extended crossover regime with coexisting and interacting quantum and classical fluctuations .    in the present work ,",
    "we theoretically investigate these phenomena in a simple model exhibiting multiscale quantum criticality .",
    "our aim here is not to go beyond the hertz - millis - moriya framework .",
    "instead , we still limit ourselves to an effective bosonic theory where the fluctuations are however characterized by multiple dynamical scales . to be specific , we consider the effective ginzburg - landau theory for the pomeranchuk instability@xcite in an isotropic metal as proposed by oganesyan _",
    "et al_.@xcite the order parameter is given by the shear modes of the fermi sphere that drive a spontaneous deformation of the fermi surface at the instability resulting in a `` nematic '' state .",
    "in @xmath0 , there are two critical bosonic shear modes characterized by different dynamical exponents .",
    "whereas one is damped by particle - hole excitations in the metal and has a dynamical exponent @xmath17 , the other is ballistic and undamped with @xmath18 .",
    "we confine ourselves to two spatial dimension , @xmath0 , where symmetry consideration allow the pomeranchuk transition to be of second order and fluctuation corrections are pronounced .    the pomeranchuk instability and its criticality has received renewed interest in recent years . in analogy to paramagnons close to a magnetic quantum phase transition in metals ,",
    "the critical collective shear fluctuations close to a pomeranchuk quantum critical point give rise to a singular interaction among the fermionic degrees of freedom leading to a breakdown of fermi - liquid theory.@xcite the structure of the critical theory , however , depends on the presence of an underlying crystal lattice .",
    "whereas in an isotropic metal the fermi - liquid properties are destroyed over the full fermi surface,@xcite well - defined quasiparticles partly survive if a crystal lattice breaks rotational symmetry from the outset.@xcite moreover , the aforementioned undamped @xmath19 mode only becomes critical in the isotropic case but is always gapped if a crystal is present .",
    "a pecularity of the nematic , i.e , pomeranchuk - ordered phase in an isotropic medium is the existence of a landau - damped goldstone mode that also leads to singular fermi - liquid corrections thus providing a rare example of an extended non - fermi - liquid phase.@xcite an extensive investigation of the mean - field properties of the pomeranchuk transition has been carried out by yamase and collaborators.@xcite a nonperturbative analysis of pomeranchuk quantum criticality was presented in refs .  , and a discussion of the pomeranchuk instability from the perspective of fermi - liquid theory was given by one of the authors.@xcite quintanilla _",
    "et al._@xcite presented a careful study of as to how the instability might arise from central interactions among quasiparticles .",
    "finally , the influence of disorder on the transition was studied in ref .  .",
    "nematic ordering was also discussed extensively in the context of cuprate superconductors , for a recent review see ref .  .",
    "on the experimental side , a metallic nematic phase in sr@xmath20ru@xmath13o@xmath21 close to its metamagnetic transition has been reported by borzi _",

    "et al._@xcite even argued that the undamped @xmath19 fluctuation mode plays no role in the critical theory because its dynamics seems to be irrelevant with respect to @xmath17 scaling ; hence , the critical theory should be fully captured by a gaussian theory as the effective dimension @xmath26 is larger than the upper critical dimension of the effective @xmath27 theory , @xmath28 .",
    "in contrast to this , we find that the scaling arguments of ref",
    ".   are misleading and that the @xmath19 mode is in fact instrumental for the pomeranchuk quantum phase transition in @xmath0 .",
    "the ballistic mode has an effective dimension @xmath29 , and it therefore generates important logarithmic singularities at @xmath3 in loop corrections .",

    "the characteristic logarithmic enhancement with exponent @xmath33 explicitly demonstrates that interactions among the @xmath18 modes lead to qualitative corrections that are beyond gaussian critical behavior .    at any finite temperatures ,",
    "the coexisting dynamics implies the presence of two thermal lengths , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , that give rise to an interesting modification of the quantum - to - classical crossover . generally at criticality , @xmath36 , critical modes",
    "change their character at the momentum scale of the inverse thermal length , @xmath37 . for larger momenta @xmath23 ,",

    "on the other hand , fluctuations are effectively classical in the sense that they are dominated by the matsubara zero mode . in the presence of only a single thermal length @xmath10 , an effective theory at criticality , @xmath36 , can be formulated that changes its character at the momentum scale @xmath38 from a quantum theory with dimension @xmath39 to an effective classical theory with dimension @xmath40 , which is also known as dimensional reduction.@xcite in the present problem of the pomeranchuk instability we find , however , that it is not possible to derive the critical properties from an effective classical model so that the concept of dimensional reduction breaks down . as illustrated in fig .",
