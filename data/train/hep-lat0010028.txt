    "qcd at finite chemical potential , @xmath1 for quark number has a complex fermion determinant .",
    "hence current simulation algorithms fail for this theory . working explicitly at finite baryon number density trades this complex determinant for a sign problem .",
    "we therefore turn to studying models which have _ some _ of the properties of qcd at finite @xmath1 .",
    "one such property suggested for qcd at finite @xmath1 is diquark condensation .",
    "it is this which led us to study 2-colour ( @xmath0 ) qcd with quarks in the fundamental representation of @xmath3 , which has a real non - negative determinant ( and pfaffian ) , permitting simulations .",
    "2-colour qcd with fundamental quarks is confining and has a sensible meson spectrum but an unphysical `` baryon '' spectrum . at @xmath4 and @xmath5 the usual @xmath6 chiral symmetry",
    "is enlarged to @xmath7 .",
    "the `` meson '' multiplets are enlarged to include 2-quark `` baryons '' .",
    "spontaneous breakdown of chiral symmetry gives @xmath8 rather than the usual @xmath9 .",
    "for large enough chemical potential we expect a spontaneous breakdown of quark number with a diquark condensate .",
    "this condensate is a colour singlet and has associated goldstone bosons @xcite . for",

    ".    the 2 flavour version of this theory can be reinterpreted as 2-colour qcd at finite chemical potential for isospin .",
    "however , it is easy to see that we can treat true ( 3-colour ) qcd at finite chemical potential for isospin since it has a real , non - negative determinant .",
    "since nuclear matter has finite ( negative ) isospin density as well as finite baryon number density , this theory describes a surface in the phase diagram for nuclear matter . for a discussion of this theory including a chiral perturbation theory analysis see @xcite .",
    "the standard staggered fermion transcription of this theory is : @xmath10\\chi   + \\frac{1}{2}\\lambda[\\chi^t\\tau_2\\chi + \\bar{\\chi}\\tau_2\\bar{\\chi}^t]\\right\\}\\ ] ] where the chemical potential @xmath1 is introduced by multiplying links in the @xmath11 direction by @xmath12 and those in the @xmath13 direction by @xmath14 . the diquark source term ( majorana mass term )",
    "is added to allow us to observe spontaneous breakdown of quark - number on a finite lattice .",
    "integrating out the fermion fields gives : @xmath15 = \\sqrt{{\\rm det}({\\cal a}^\\dagger { \\cal a } + \\lambda^2)}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 note that the pfaffian is strictly positive , so that we can use the hybrid molecular dynamics method to simulate this theory using `` noisy '' fermions to take the square root , giving @xmath17 .",
    "when @xmath18 , the chiral symmetry of the above action is expanded to @xmath19 , from the @xmath20 of true lattice qcd .",

    "we have no spontaneous symmetry breaking for small @xmath1 .",
    "for @xmath1 large enough ( @xmath26 ? ) we expect spontaneous breakdown of quark number and one goldstone boson  a scalar diquark .",
    "( see @xcite for a full discussion of these symmetries , and for early simulations of the 8 flavour theory at @xmath27 . )",
    "we are simulating this @xmath17 theory on an @xmath28 lattice , measuring the chiral and diquark condensates , the fermion number density , the wilson / polyakov line , etc .. we are repeating these simulations on @xmath29 lattices , where , in addition , we are measuring all local scalar and pseudoscalar meson and diquark propagators ( connected and disconnected ) .",
    "we have preliminary results for a relatively large quark mass , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ( and @xmath32 for small @xmath1 ) .",
    "we have recently started simulations at a small quark mass , @xmath33 and @xmath34 where we should observe a more complex spectrum of goldstone and pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "finally we will simulate at @xmath4 where there should be 3 goldstone bosons for @xmath5 and 2 goldstone bosons for @xmath35 .",
    "all our simulations are done at @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig : pt2p ] shows the diquark condensate @xmath37 as a function of chemical potential potential .    for small @xmath1",
    "there is no diquark condensate and quark - number is a good symmetry . at @xmath38",
    "there is a phase transition , above which there is a diquark condensate , and quark - number is spontaneously broken .",
    "this condensate increases to a maximum and then falls towards zero at large @xmath1 .",
    "figure [ fig : pbp ] shows the chiral condensate , @xmath39 as a function of @xmath1 .",

    "figure [ fig : j0 ] shows the quark - number density as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "the quark - number density @xmath42 is zero for @xmath40 and increases for @xmath43 approaching the saturation value @xmath44 for large @xmath1 .",
    "finally , in figure  [ fig : mass ] we show the masses of the pion and the scalar diquark state which is orthogonal to the diquark condensate , as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "this is from the @xmath29 lattice where we have less complete ` data ' .",
    "the mass of the scalar diquark falls roughly as the expected @xmath45 as @xmath1 is increased towards @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath43 it is small enough and its @xmath47 dependence is such that one can believe that it would become massless as @xmath48 . thus the scalar diquark does appear to be the goldstone boson associated with spontaneous quark - number breaking .",
    "the pion mass appears to remain constant for @xmath40 , dropping towards zero as @xmath1 is increased beyond @xmath46 .",
    "this mass spectrum and the behaviour of the order parameters is in good agreement with the predictions from chiral perturbation theory for @xmath49 .",
    "for qcd at finite chemical potential for isospin ( @xmath50 ) , the staggered quark action is @xmath51\\chi                          + \\lambda\\bar{\\chi}i\\tau_2\\epsilon\\chi\\right\\}\\ ] ] where the explicit symmetry breaking term proportional to @xmath47 is needed to observe spontaneous isospin breaking on finite lattices ; @xmath52 are isospin matrices acting on the isodoublet @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "integrating out the fermion fields yields : @xmath55 where @xmath16 note @xmath56 is only a @xmath57 matrix in isospin space .",
    "this describes 8 fermion flavours , so we use hybrid molecular dynamics with `` noisy '' fermions to perform the simulations , to reduce this to 2 flavours .",
    "note this determinant has exactly the same form as that for 2-colour qcd at finite quark number density , except now we can use @xmath2 colour . to get a sensible flavour interpretation for this 2-flavour theory in the continuum limit requires making the field redefinition @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the analogue of @xmath60 in @xmath61 flavour space .",
    "2-colour qcd at finite chemical potential for quark number undergoes a phase transition at @xmath62 .",
    "the high @xmath1 phase is characterized by spontaneous breakdown of quark number precipitated by a diquark condensate , with a single goldstone boson .",
    "is there a second transition at high @xmath1 to a free - field phase ?",
    "what can we learn from this model about diquark condensates in true ( @xmath2 ) qcd ?",
    "we need to simulate at smaller quark masses ( including zero ) where the competition between chiral and quark - number symmetry breaking should lead to a more complex spectrum of goldstone and pseudo - goldstone bosons .",
    "a more extensive analysis of the spectrum of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons and diquarks is called for .",
    "qcd at finite chemical potential , @xmath63 , for isospin maps a surface in the phase diagram of nuclear matter which , in addition to having a finite baryon number density , also has a finite ( negative ) isospin density . a reinterpretation of 2-colour qcd at finite quark number density yields 2-colour qcd at finite isospin density , and gives us a guide as to what to expect in the 3-colour case .",
    "at finite @xmath63 , true ( 3-colour ) qcd has a real positive determinant which allows us to simulate it . for large enough chemical potential we should get spontaneous breaking of the remaining @xmath64 isospin symmetry generated by @xmath50 with a charged pion condensate and one true goldstone pion .",
