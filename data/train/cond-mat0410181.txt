    "in this paper , we present a scheme for performing measurements of one- and two - electron double well systems ( dwss ) in non - local bases .",
    "the principle idea behind both schemes is to detect the small charge differences at the midpoint of the dws  for different electronic states using a single electron transistor ( set ) as a sensitive electrometer .",
    "set s have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive electrometers , with sensitivities of a few @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "we therefore expect that they could detect fluctuations of around 1% of an electron charge in around 10 - 100 ns .    for the one electron case",
    ", the measurement is in the parity eigenbasis .",
    "this is interesting since it results in projection onto non - local states .",
    "it has been shown theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite that decoherence is slower for an evenly biased dws , so this kind of measurement may be more robust against decoherence .    for a two electron system we show that this measurement approximately projects the dws  onto the singlet ( even ) and triplet ( odd ) subspaces .",
    "it is therefore a method for performing spin sensitive detection using electrometers , which is important for readout of certain quantum information processing schemes @xcite .",
    "the paper begins in section [ sec : system ] with a short , generic discussion of the microscopic model of a few electron system interacting with an idealised set , itself in contact with a continuum of lead modes . following this , section [ sec : sp ] deals with the single electron case , and section [ sec : tp ] deals with the two electron case . within each of these two sections",
    "we develop the measurement hamiltonian from microscopic considerations , from which we derive measurement and mixing times . after showing in each case that the measurements work in principle",
    ", we estimate the effects of a significant problem in the fabrication of this device , namely the precision with which the set island must be placed in the midplane of the dws .",
    "section [ sec : estimationofparameters ] concludes the paper with a discussion about experimental implementation of the scheme .",
    "schematic of physical system under consideration , width=151 ]    we consider the device pictured in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublewellsystem ] , consisting of a set placed in the mid - plane of the dws , in order to be sensitive to the charge at the midpoint .",
    "this charge differs between symmetric and antisymmetric spatial wavefunctions , and we analyse a scheme to measure this difference in order to effect projective measurements onto the parity eigenspaces .    for the purposes of this paper , we assume the set island has only a single accessible energy level , which is reasonable if the island is small and the difference between fermi energies in the leads is less than the charging energy of the island .",
    "we model the dws  with a hubbard hamiltonian , with only a single spatial wavefunction per well , @xmath1 and @xmath2 for the left and right wells .",
    "we assume that the hilbert space for the system is therefore two - dimensional , which is reasonable if higher excited state are inaccessible due to the strong confinement of the quantum dot potentials .",
    "therefore , each well may be populated by at most two electrons , in different spin configurations .",
    "the hamiltonian for a system of interacting electrons is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a ( fermionic ) annihilation operator for an electron in spatial mode @xmath5 and spin @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the spatial wavefunction for mode @xmath5 ( assuming both spin states have the same spatial wavefunction ) , @xmath9 is the ` vacuum ' state , with no quasi - particle excitations , @xmath10 is the effective mass , @xmath11 is the electrostatic confining potential and @xmath12 is the coulomb potential .",
    "we choose a basis set such that @xmath13 is diagonal , which we truncate to the lowest two eigenstates for the dws , and a single state , @xmath14 , on the set . in the absence of an external bias between the wells",
    ", this corresponds to taking @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the symmetric and antisymmetric superpositions of the localised , single - particle states , referred to here as the parity eigenbasis .",
    "that is @xmath17 the first term of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian1 ] ) becomes @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the tunnelling rate of a localised electron , which we estimate in section [ sec : estimationofparameters ] .    expanding eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian1 ] ) gives @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the hubbard hamiltonian for the dws , @xmath23 is the hamiltonian for the interaction between the dws  and the set and @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the island energy level , in the absence of interactions with the double well potential , @xmath26 are the energies of densely spaced lead modes , @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the left and right leads respectively , @xmath29 are the corresponding tunnelling rates between mode @xmath30 in lead @xmath31 and the set island .    to compute @xmath32",
    "we assume that the wavefunction for electrons on the set island vanishes in the region where the wavefunction for the electron on the dws  has support , and vice versa , so that for instance @xmath33 .",
    "this assumption is a good one for systems such as the kane proposal @xcite , or na@xmath34 in si @xcite , where the tunnelling rates between set island and the dws  are negligible .",
    "the consequence of this assumption is that if any index in @xmath35 is @xmath14 , then @xmath35 is zero unless @xmath36 or @xmath37 , where @xmath14 labels an electron on the set island .",
    "therefore the only coulomb terms that contribute to the interaction between the set island and the dws  are given by @xmath38 where we have ignored the spin degree of freedom on the set island .",
    "there are four distinct terms of this form that need to be included , for @xmath39 taking the four possible assignments of @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "if the physical arrangement of double well and island as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublewellsystem ] is symmetric about a line bisecting the double well potential , then @xmath42 , as discussed in appendix [ app : approximations ] .",
    "asymmetry results in non - zero @xmath43 , and for the development of this section , we assume that it is symmetric , so that @xmath44 . thus , to describe a dws  interacting with an set we need to specify @xmath22 and @xmath45",
    "the system we consider in this section consists of a single electron shared between two wells , so we ignore spin indices .",
    "we now establish the feasibility of performing a measurement in the parity eigenbasis of a single electron shared between the two wells .      for a single electron on an unbiased double well , the interaction terms of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hamiltonian1 ] ) vanishes , so the hubbard hamiltonian for the single particle system is given by @xmath46 we have used the fact that , for a single - particle , two - level system @xmath47 is the identity , and have also discarded terms proportional to @xmath48 . in an alternate notation , we identify @xmath49 with the @xmath50 operator .",
    "for the symmetric case , @xmath51 where @xmath52 and we have again used the single particle , two - level system identity @xmath47 .",
    "it is evident from eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : singleparticleham ] ) and ( [ eqn : singleparticlemeas ] ) that the measurement hamiltonian and the system hamiltonian have the same energy eigenstates . therefore , the measurement process will non - destructively project onto energy eigenstates of the dws , which are the delocalised symmetric and antisymmetric wavefunctions .",
    "that is , it is a qnd ( quantum non - demolition ) measurement , which simplifies the analysis greatly .      as discussed in appendix [ app : mesp ] , the master equation for the dws  and set island is given by @xmath53 } + ( \\gamma_l+\\gamma_r ) { \\mathcal{d}}[{\\hat n}_-c_{s}^\\dagger]{r}(t ) + \\gamma_r'{\\mathcal{d}}[{\\hat n}_+c_{s}]{r}(t ) + \\gamma_l'{\\mathcal{d}}[{\\hat n}_+c_{s}^\\dagger]{r}(t),\\label{eqn : spmaster1}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is the density matrix for the dws  and set island and @xmath55b\\equiv { { \\mathcal j}}[a]b-{{\\mathcal a}}[a]b\\equiv aba^\\dagger-\\frac{1}{2}(a^\\dagger a b+b a^\\dagger a)$ ] .",
    "we assume that the reduced state of the set island is diagonal in the number representation , so @xmath56 the reduced density matrix of the dws is given by @xmath57 . in appendix",
    "[ app : mesp ] we solve eq .",
    "( [ eqn : spmaster1 ] ) and the steady - state reduced density matrix of the dws  is @xmath58 where @xmath59 .",
    "this shows that the diagonal elements of the system density matrix are unchanged , whilst the off - diagonal elements have completely decayed , which corresponds to qnd measurement .",
    "since the measurement for the single electron case is a qnd measurement , we can straightforwardly calculate the expected currents and measurement times for the device . if we choose @xmath60 and @xmath61 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : singleparticleenergylevel ] , then the current through the set is sensitive to the state of the dws . in this configuration ,",
    "the set island is conducting when the dws  is in a symmetric state , so a current @xmath62 flows , and non - conducting when in an antisymmetric state , so @xmath63 .",
    "thus the measurement amounts to distinguishing the currents @xmath62 and @xmath63 through the set .    for the symmetric configuration ,",
    "the rates at which electrons hop on and off the set island , are given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "thus the rate of transport of electrons through the set island is @xmath66 .",
    "the current is therefore @xmath67 .",
    "the measurement time is then the time required to distinguish two currents , @xmath62 from @xmath63 in the presence of shot noise .",
    "since the transport of electrons through the set is poissonian , the probability of detecting zero electrons tunnelling in a time @xmath68 through the set island , given that a mean current @xmath62 is flowing is given by @xmath69 .",
    "we therefore conclude that the measurement time is @xmath70 , since the probability of not detecting a tunnelling event in ( a few multiples of ) this time is small .",
    "this agrees with the measurement determined from the decay rate of off diagonal elements of the system density matrix , found in appendix [ app : mesp ] .",
    "we now turn to the important practical issue of how precisely the set island needs to be placed with respect to the centre of the double well potential . here",
    "we assume there is some asymmetry , which may , for example , arise from fabrication , so that @xmath71 .",
    "we will estimate the magnitude of this quantity later , but first we will determine the effect of the extra terms in the hamiltonian that arise . including this term in @xmath32",
    "gives @xmath72 this shows that the asymmetry rotates the measurement basis by an angle @xmath73 away from the parity eigenbasis , that is , the preferred basis for the measurement is @xmath74 .",
    "we therefore require that @xmath75 in order that the asymmetry have negligible effect .    in appendix",
    "[ app : approximations ] we estimate @xmath43 and @xmath76 to be @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the ` centre - of - mass ' of the left well , @xmath79 is the position vector of the set island and we choose the origin to be at the midpoint of the dws .",
    "note that @xmath80 for a symmetrically placed island , and is assumed to be small .",
    "the condition that @xmath75 is therefore satisfied if @xmath81 .",
    "this is a tight constraint , since it requires that the asymmetry , quantified by @xmath82 , be much less than the overlap of the localised wavefunctions @xmath83 . with the help of a @xmath84-gate ( as referred to in @xcite ) @xmath83 may be made as high as 0.03 @xcite , and assuming a typical scale of device of @xmath85 nm , the elements of the set and dws  would likely need to be made with a precision of 1 nm or less , which seems difficult with current technology .",
    "this issue may not be so significant for electrostatically defined dots , since the position of the set island and dws  may be changed by variation of surface gate potentials .",
    "it is a serious problem for donor systems with set s grown by metallic deposition , since the location of the donor atoms and set island are fixed during fabrication .",
    "asymmetry in the placement of the set island induces mixing in the state of the dws , so there is a mixing time associated with asymmetry .",
    "the calculation of the mixing time is somewhat lengthy , but not difficult .",
    "we derive an unconditional master equation for the density matrix of the dws  and set , @xmath86 .",
    "the solution to the master equation has exponentially decaying terms , with different time constants . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", here we present the results of the calculation , and leave the details to appendix [ app : asymmesp ] , which follows from the results of appendix [ app : noncomme ] .",
    "taking @xmath87 , the most rapidly decaying term gives the measurement time , @xmath88 , which is unchanged from the symmetric case ( to within @xmath89 ) .",
    "the slowest decaying term gives the measurement induced mixing time , @xmath90 , so the condition for a good measurement is that @xmath91 , which occurs if @xmath92 , in agreement with above .",
    "when @xmath44 , the measurement is qnd , @xmath93 .",
    "when @xmath94 , the dynamics are divided into two regimes , @xmath95 and @xmath96 . in the energy eigenbasis , for short times , @xmath95 , the diagonal elements of the density matrix are almost unaffected whilst the off - diagonal elements decay at a rate @xmath97 .",
    "this corresponds to the process of projecting the dws   onto its energy eigenstates . over longer times , @xmath96 , the diagonal matrix elements decay to their steady - state values , given by eq .",
    "( [ eqn : sssolsp ] ) , corresponding to almost complete relaxation of the dws  to its ground state @xmath98 .      performing a ` non - local ' measurement by projecting onto the parity eigenbasis of a dws  is in principle possible .",
    "an set placed in the midplane of the dws   is sensitive to the local charge at the midpoint of the system , which depends on the parity of the state .",
    "estimates of the sensitivity of such a device to asymmetry in the placement of the set island suggest that it would need to be placed with a precision better than @xmath99 of the typical device dimensions . for a donor based system , this is around 1 nm , which has been demonstrated recently for p@xmath34 donors in si @xcite .",
    "the scheme may still be usefully applied in the case where @xmath100 , where the preferred measurement basis is close to the parity eigenbasis . applying a bias across the dws , so that one well is at a higher potential than the other , would allow one to rotate the double well energy eigenbasis onto the measurement eigenbasis .",
    "the precise placement of the set island in an electrostatically defined system may not present serious problems , since it may be moved about after fabrication by varying surface gate voltages . in section [ sec : estimationofparameters ] , we give estimates of expirementally accessible parameter values , and show that this proposal is experimentally viable .",
    "we consider here a dws  populated with two electrons , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : doublewellsystem ] . as in the single electron parity measurement scheme ,",
    "the set island is placed in the midplane of the dws , so that it is sensitive to the charge distribution on the dws .",
    "the physical principle that we exploit is the fact that a pair of electrons in a triplet state are pauli blocked from being simultaneously at the origin of the dws , so the probability amplitude to find two electrons in a triplet at the origin is zero .",
    "in contrast , this restriction does not apply to a pair in a singlet state , so there is a non - zero probability amplitude to find two electrons in a singlet near the origin .",
    "thus there is a small variation in the local charge density at the origin between singlet and triplet states , which can in principle be measured to distinguish these subspaces .",
    "this has some similarities to another singlet - triplet measurement scheme @xcite .",
    "such systems may be used to implement quantum information processing tasks . in certain instances",
    "it is important to distinguish whether the two electrons are in a singlet state or a triplet state , thereby providing information about their spin state , e.g. distinguishing a state from the triplet states is necessary in the three - in - one encoding scheme developed by @xcite .      in this system",
    ", there is one singly occupied singlet state and three singly occupied triplet states , which are given by @xmath101 the spatial wavefunction of the singlet state is clearly symmetric , whilst the spin wavefunction is antisymmetric .",
    "the converse is true for the triplet states . written in the parity eigenbasis ,",
    "it is clear that there are different charge densities between the wells depending on the state : the singlet state is a superposition of terms with non - zero amplitude to find either zero electrons ( both in the @xmath98 state , with zero charge density at the midpoint ) or two electrons ( both in the @xmath102 state , with non - zero charge density at the midpoint ) to exist between the wells , whilst the triplet states have an amplitude to find only a single electron ( only one electron in the @xmath102 ) state to be located at the midpoint .",
    "there are also two doubly occupied states given by @xmath103    as discussed in section [ sec : system ] , we need to specify the dws  dynamics , given by @xmath22 , as well as the interaction between the dws  and the set , given by @xmath45 . in the parity eigenbasis , @xmath22 is given by @xmath104 where @xmath20 as defined earlier and @xmath105 is the double occupation coulomb energy .",
    "the triplet states are eigenstates of the two - site hubbard hamiltonian , so decouple from the other states . with respect to the ordered sub - basis @xmath106",
    "the matrix for the hubbard hamiltonian is @xmath107    we now turn to the interaction between the two electron system and the nearby set island populated with at most one electron .",
    "there are four distinct terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : paritycoulomb ] ) that need to be computed , for @xmath39 taking the four possible assignments of @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "the triplet states are once again eigenstates of @xmath45 , with eigenvalue @xmath108 . again with respect to the ordered sub - basis @xmath106 , the matrix representation of @xmath45 is @xmath109 where @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 as defined earlier . as discussed in section [ sec : parityasym ] , if the physical arrangement of dws  and set island as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : doublewellsystem ] is symmetric about a line bisecting the double well potential , then @xmath44 .",
    "asymmetry results in @xmath94 .    finally , we include the internal dynamics of the leads and of the island , which is assumed to have at most a single electron , as well as tunnelling between the leads and the island .",
    "the hamiltonians for these parts of the complete system are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : hisle ] ) to ( [ eqn : htun ] ) .",
    "we now have the ingredients for the model hamiltonian of the dws , set island and leads @xmath113      in this section , we will assume that the set is placed symmetrically with respect to the dws , so @xmath44 .",
    "the triplet states and @xmath114 are energy eigenstates of both @xmath22 and @xmath45 . similarly , since @xmath76 and @xmath115 are small , @xmath116 is approximately an eigenstates of both @xmath22 and @xmath45 .",
    "the induced charge on the set island is different for the triplet states compared with the singlet , due to their slightly different charge configurations , so different currents flow through the set depending on the subspace the electron pair is in .",
    "thus , distinguishing distinct currents through the set yields ( approximately ) qnd projective measurements onto the singlet or triplet subspaces .",
    "this is analogous to the situation described for the single particle in section [ sec : sp ] for doing qnd measurements in the parity eigenbasis .",
    "[ sec : tpheurmeas ]    the induced shift in the set island energy depends on the state of the dws .",
    "we can calculate the set island energy shift by imagining the dws  in a given state , then adiabatically turning on the set ",
    "dws  interaction , @xmath23 . physically",
    ", this corresponds to slowly bringing the occupied set island close to the dws , and observing the change in energy of the total system during this process .",
    "comparing the adiabatic energy shift for a dws  in a singlet with the energy shift for a dws  in a triplet gives the differential shift of the set island between the singlet and a triplet states .",
    "a triplet state is an energy eigenstates of @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the adiabatic parameter controlling the coupling strength .",
    "therefore the adiabatic variation of the coupling does not change the eigenstate , just the eigenenergy , @xmath119    for a singlet state , which is almost , but not quite , an eigenstate of @xmath117 , we can estimate the induced shift by calculating the same adiabatic energy shift for the ground state @xmath120 which is very close to the singlet .",
    "we find @xmath121    thus , the difference between the set island energy for the triplet and singlet state is @xmath122 , which corresponds to a differential induced set island energy depending on the state of the dws .",
    "it should therefore be possible to arrange the lead energies so that the set current also depends on the state of the dws . by tuning the lead chemical potentials so that @xmath123 , current flows through the set if the dws  is in the triplet subspace , but does not for the subspace @xmath124 .",
    "this configuration is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoparticleenergylevel ] , where @xmath125 lies in between the lead fermi energies , and @xmath126 lies below the fermi energies .",
    "the other levels shown in fig .  [ fig : twoparticleenergylevel ] represent possible inelastic transitions as lead electrons tunnel onto the set island , and are described in more detail in appendix [ app : lindop ] . in this manner",
    ", the two subspaces may be distinguished by measuring the set current .",
    "since the measurement is qnd in the triplet subspace , we use the same arguments as section [ sec : spmeastime ] to estimate the set current when the dws  is a triplet .",
    "assuming electrons tunnel between the leads and the set island at a rate @xmath127 , then for the configuration of lead energies described above , the current for the triplet state will be @xmath128 .    the singlet state is approximately an eigenstate of @xmath22 and @xmath45 , so the same reasoning concludes that the singlet current should be approximately zero , @xmath129 .",
    "the measurement time for distinguishing these two currents is then roughly @xmath130 , just as in section [ sec : spmeastime ] .    as mentioned above",
    ", the singlet state is not quite an eigenstate of the system or measurement hamiltonians , so there are corrections to the latter part of this argument .",
    "the dynamics mix the singly occupied state @xmath116 and the doubly occupied state @xmath131 .",
    "thus there is a small amplitude for the evolution to induce transitions from @xmath116 to @xmath131 . in general these transitions",
    "are strongly inhibited since there is a large energy gap @xmath132 to excite the dws  to the doubly occupied state .",
    "appendix [ sec : singletmixing ] shows that in the steady state , the probability for the dws  to be in a singlet state is very close to unity , @xmath133 .",
    "this means that the measurement on the singlet subspace is indeed almost qnd , since the singlet is not changed greatly during measurement .",
    "associated with the infrequent fluctuations between @xmath116 and @xmath131 is a small current . to estimate an upper bound on the current , @xmath134 that could flow through the set when the dws  is in the singlet state",
    ", we compute the rate at which electrons cycle on and off the set island . in appendix [ app : tptraj ] we show @xmath135 .",
    "this shows that @xmath136 and @xmath137 are very different , and the measurement is indeed close to qnd .",
    "asymmetry , @xmath94 , couples the states @xmath131 and @xmath114 , evident in the form of @xmath45 , in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : hmeas ] ) .",
    "we find the steady state probability for the dws  to be in a singlet , @xmath138 .",
    "we also compute the rate at which electrons cycle on and off the set island , described in appendices [ app : tptraj ] and [ app : assymbk ] , which leads to an upper bound on the current given by @xmath139 .",
    "both the steady - state singlet probability , and the upper bound on the current for the asymmetric case are similar to the results for the symmetric case derived in appendices [ sec : singletmixing ] and [ app : tptraj ] , indicating the measurement is rather _ insensitive _ to set asymmetry . for larger values of @xmath140 , when @xmath141 , the dws  is driven into the doubly occupied subspace , which is the basis of an alternative singlet ",
    "triplet measurement scheme @xcite .      in principle the scheme outlined above",
    "enables measurement in the singlet - triplet basis .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to measure distinguishable currents through the set depending on the state of the dws .",
    "the energy scales for the singlet  triplet measurement are smaller than those for the single - particle system , by a factor of @xmath142 , and this requires the lead temperatures to be smaller by a similar factor .",
    "we have also established that asymmetry in the fabrication of the device is less of a problem for this measurement scheme than for the single particle scheme .",
    "we now estimate the required parameters for various experimentally realisable systems .",
    "firstly we have assumed that @xmath143 .",
    "we also require that the temperature be smaller than the set energy shift induced by the dws .",
    "thus , for the single particle case , we require that @xmath144 , and fig .  [ fig : twoparticleenergylevel ] indicates that for the two - particle system , the temperature must be smaller than the splitting between @xmath145 and @xmath146 , i.e. @xmath147 .",
    "this is obviously a tight constraint on the temperature of the system .",
    "furthermore , as discussed in section [ app : noncomme ] , we require the line - width of the set island state must be smaller than the energy level splittings , i.e.@xmath148 for the single - particle case and @xmath149 for the two - particle case .",
    "finally , cotunneling will contribute a background current due to tunneling via virtual population of the set island .    in order to estimate the various parameters introduced for this problem",

    "we approximate the localised states as @xmath150-orbitals bound to each site , so that @xmath151 , where @xmath152 is the inverse bohr radius .",
    "the integral @xmath83 may be performed in prolate ellipsoidal coordinates @xcite to give @xmath153 , where @xmath154 is the separation between the double well minima .",
    "we can estimate @xmath115 , the tunnelling rate between localised states , for the case of an @xmath150-orbital bound to a donor atom , and we will use this estimate for the case of electrostatically defined gates as well . following a similar argument to the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : delta ] ) , we can show that @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the time - independent , single - particle hamiltonian .",
    "assuming @xmath157 , we may again evaluate the integrals @xmath158 and @xmath159 in prolate ellipsoidal coordinates @xcite to find that the single particle tunnelling rate is given to reasonable approximation by @xmath160 .    for many materials , e.g. si or gaas , @xmath161 ev nm . for a donor atom system in si , where @xmath162 nm is a reasonable estimate for the height of the set island above the donor system , and @xmath163 nm and a bohr radius of @xmath164 nm , giving @xmath165 , and ignoring the anisotropic effective mass of si @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath166 @xmath167ev .",
    "similarly @xmath168 @xmath167ev .",
    "these figures could be increased to perhaps 200 @xmath167ev using an external @xmath84-gate , since the overlap integral depends exponentially on the @xmath84-gate potential .",
    "finally we estimate @xmath169 mev @xcite for donor impurity systems . in an electrostatically defined system such as gaas dots , reasonable estimates for the various parameters",

    "in double donor systems , such as the kane proposal @xmath174 @xmath167ev is still reasonable , but since @xmath169 mev , the relevant temperature is around ten times smaller , which is probably too small to be practical .",

    "( [ eqn:2pmasterequation ] ) , and derive the conditional dynamics of quantum trajectories . from the unravelling we can provide estimates for set currents .",
    "we assume the system may be described by the density matrix given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : r ] ) , i.e.  the set island does not support coherent superpositions of @xmath357 and @xmath358 electrons .",
    "we may therefore reduce the master equation given in eq .",
    "( [ eqn:2pmasterequation ] ) to a pair of master equations for @xmath359 and @xmath360 .",
    "the dynamics of the system decouple , depending on the state of the dws .",
    "in particular , the triplet states and @xmath114 are eigenstates of the evolution operators , so we may consider the dynamics separately in each of the uncoupled , 1d subspaces @xmath361 . in these subspaces",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is proportional to the identity so the reduced master equations for each subspace are of the form @xmath362{\\rho}_1-\\gamma_l{{\\mathcal a}}[p]{\\rho}_0\\\\ \\dot{\\rho}_1&=&\\gamma_l { { \\mathcal j}}[p]{\\rho}_0-\\gamma_r{{\\mathcal a}}[p]{\\rho}_1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath363 is the projector onto the subspace , e.g.  for the subspace @xmath364 , @xmath365 .",
    "these reduced master equations depend on only a single jump operator @xmath363 , so the evolution between jumps may be written as a pure state , @xmath366 , @xmath367 or 1 , governed by the non - hermitian effective hamiltonian , @xmath368 according to the schrdinger equation @xcite @xmath369 the non - hermitian hamiltonians for each subspace are @xmath370 .",
    "the solution is simply @xmath371 and @xmath372 .",
    "the jump rate is determined by the cumulative density function ( cdf ) for the waiting time between jumps @xmath373 so @xmath374 and @xmath375 .",
    "thus we have a cycle of electrons hopping onto the set from the left lead at a rate @xmath64 then hopping off to the right lead at a rate @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore expect a current @xmath376 to flow through the set when the dws  is in the triplet subspace , in agreement with above .",
    "we now turn to the more complicated dynamics in the singlet subspace , @xmath124 . to simplify the analysis of this system",
    ", we will ignore the lindblad terms depending on @xmath353 and @xmath327 in the master equation , eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tpme ] ) .",
    "this is reasonable since these terms are @xmath377 , which is small . for the resulting approximate form of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tpme ] ) the dynamics between jumps are governed by effective hamiltonians for each set island state , @xmath378 , with a _ single _",
    "jump operator , @xmath379 and @xmath380 .",
    "since there is only a single jump operator associated with @xmath368 , we unravel the master equations as non - hermitian schrdinger equations for the pure , conditional , unnormalised , between - jump state - vectors , @xmath381 , where @xmath382 @xcite . during a jump at time @xmath383",
    ", the state of the system evolves discontinuously according to @xmath384 and @xmath385 .    to derive an upper bound on @xmath134",
    ", we calculate the rate at which electrons hop on and off the set , given that the dws  begins in a singlet state .",
    "the jump rate is determined by the cdf for the lifetime of the set state with @xmath367 or 1 electrons , @xmath373 .",
    "this quantity depends on the state of the dws  immediately after the most recent jump , @xmath386 , which is not deterministic due to the stochastic nature of the trajectory .",
    "however , as discussed in section [ sec : singletmixing ] , the steady state of the dws , @xmath387 , is very close to the singlet state since @xmath388 @xcite .",
    "therefore , for the purposes of computing the cdf , to very good approximation , we can make the replacement @xmath389 .",
    "the unnormalised , conditional state of the dws  betweens jump is then @xmath390 where @xmath391 is measured from the previous jump .",
    "it follows that the cdfs for the jump times are @xmath392 and @xmath393 .",
    "these cdfs show that the lifetime of an empty set is short , @xmath394 , whilst the lifetime of an occupied set is very long , @xmath395 .",
    "thus the cycle time for electrons to hop on and off the island is approximately @xmath396 , and this provides an upper bound on the set current when the dws  starts in the singlet state , @xmath397 .",
    "this is much less than @xmath137 , in agreement with the heuristic prediction that @xmath398 .    to confirm these approximate analytical predictions ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of the conditional dynamics derived from the master equation eq .",
    "( [ eqn : tpme ] ) , which is not subject to any of the approximations made in this section . in fig .",
    "[ fig : twoparticlejumptrace ] we show the projection @xmath399 immediately after jump @xmath268 for a sample of 200 jumps , assuming parameter values @xmath400 . in this figure",
    "it is evident that the dws  typically remains close to the singlet state after every jump , in agreement with the preceding analysis .",
    "furthermore , we plot the distribution of waiting times between jumps for a simulation of 10000 sequential jumps , shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : histogram0 ] for an empty island ( @xmath367 ) and in fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram1 ] for an occupied island ( @xmath401 ) . for the parameters chosen ,",
    "the figures show that the set remains empty for a characteristic time of around @xmath402 , whilst the typical occupation time is around @xmath403 .",
    "these times are in agreement with the analytic estimates given above for which @xmath404 and @xmath405 .",
    "we now consider the effect of asymmetry in the placement of the set island , where @xmath94 . as in appendix",
    "[ app : noncomme ] we express @xmath248 in a fourier decomposition restricted to the ordered basis @xmath106 , which spans the _ singlet subspace_. the fourier components of this operator are crucial for deriving the master equation with which to analyse the system .",
