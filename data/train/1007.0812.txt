    "single - crystal neutron scattering studies of their parent compounds have indicated a commensurate magnetic ordering with iron moments ordered ferromagnetically in the @xmath8 direction and antiferromagnetically in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 directions.@xcite inelastic neutron scattering measurements in @xmath11 ( a = ca , ba , sr ) yield sharp spin - wave excitations on an energy scale @xmath12mev.@xcite    all known compounds in these classes contain feas layers and exhibit a common phase diagram , with parent compounds exhibiting a magnetically ordered sdw state below @xmath13 k , and onset of superconductivity following the suppression of long - range magnetic order by electron doping or pressure .",
    "contrast with cuprates has naturally followed in order to gain insight from the significant progress made in understanding superconductivity and magnetism in correlated electron systems.@xcite while onset of superconductivity at finite doping is a common feature , in contrast to the mott insulating nature of cuprates , the pnictides appear to be commensurate sdw systems in the intermediate coupling regime .",

    "anisotropic spin wave velocities naturally follow from the different @xmath67 coefficients in the f and af directions .",
    "the above instability can also be seen from energy considerations .",
    "the classical energy per spin for the two orderings are : @xmath68 and @xmath69 , so that the f - af state becomes energetically favourable for @xmath70 . in three dimensions , the colinear @xmath35 state is stable even at the classical level , unlike the degeneracy present in the @xmath71 case at this level .    as an illustration of quantum corrections beyond the hf approximation , the spin - fluctuation correction @xmath72 to the sublattice magnetization in the f - af phase , which can be evaluated from the magnon propagator in terms of the transverse spin correlations,@xcite is shown in fig .",
    "the correction in the af phase is also shown for comparison .",
    "near the transition point @xmath73 , the correction in the f - af phase is seen to be nearly half of that in the af phase , indicating greater robustness of the f - af phase with respect to quantum spin fluctuations .",
    "the spin - fluctuation correction in both phases approaches 1 ( the hf value of sublattice magnetization ) only very close to the critical value @xmath73 .",
    "this implies that ( up to first order ) @xmath26 vanishes only very close to @xmath73 , so that the extent of the spin - disordered phase is quite narrow .",
    "this is unlike the @xmath71 case , where the af order is lost at @xmath74 , well before the f - af state appears at @xmath75 .",
    "as shown by the strong - coupling analysis of the previous section , af nnn spin couplings @xmath49 generated by @xmath3 stabilize the undoped f - af state ( for @xmath76 in two and @xmath77 in three dimensions ) .",
    "so how is the f - af state affected by other physical processes which might also generate effective nnn spin couplings ?",
    "af nnn spin couplings are generated even in the absence of @xmath3 , as in the @xmath78 model at finite doping .",
    "in fact , it is these effectively frustrating spin couplings , generated by intra - band particle - hole processes , which are responsible for destabilizing the af state at any finite doping , as observed in hole doped cuprates.@xcite however , as the f - af state is actually stabilized rather than being frustrated by the af nnn spin couplings , these doping - induced spin couplings should actually favour the f - af state by supplementing the @xmath3-induced spin couplings .    more importantly , carrier - induced f nn spin couplings responsible for metallic ferromagnetism become increasingly important at finite doping .",
    "this is especially so in presence of small @xmath3 , which can cause strongly peaked electronic spectral distribution due to band dispersion saddle points @xmath79 , which strongly enhance band ferromagnetism by increasing the delocalization contribution @xmath80 to spin stiffness while strongly suppressing the correlation - induced exchange contribution @xmath81 due to correlated motion of electrons.@xcite the f - af state at finite doping is therefore expected to be stabilized at even lower @xmath3 values . in this section",
    "we will show that indeed finite hole doping and small @xmath3 strongly stabilizes the f - af state .",
    "2 show the spin wave energy along symmetry directions in the brillouin zone for the doped f - af state , with orderings @xmath0 and @xmath1 as considered earlier .",
    "the variation of wave - vector @xmath82 follows the sequence @xmath83 in @xmath84 and @xmath85 in @xmath86 . in order to focus on doping dependence ,",
    "the sdw bands were kept unchanged with fixed @xmath87 .",
    "the rapid crossover from negative to positive energy magnon modes shows a strong stabilization of the f - af state upon hole doping .",
    "this stabilization occurs for much smaller @xmath3 values compared to the critical values required in the undoped f - af state .",
    "a finite @xmath3 is quite realistic in view of the hybridization between fe and as orbitals .",
    "the anisotropic spin wave velocities , evident from the different slopes in the f and af directions in fig .",
    "2(a ) , can be understood readily in terms of the independent origin ( delocalization and exchange ) of the effective f and af spin couplings , resulting in different coefficients of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , as in eq .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath90mev and @xmath14 in the intermediate coupling regime , the calculated spin wave energy scale of around 200mev is as observed in neutron scattering measurements of iron pnictides .",
    "are the doping - induced spin couplings sufficient to stabilize the f - af state without any finite @xmath3 ?",
    "we find that in the absence of @xmath3 the f - af state is not stabilized for any doping . while af and f orderings do get separately stabilized at low and high hole dopings , respectively , as indicated by the spin - wave dispersion along af and f directions , both are not simultaneously stabilized .",
    "thus , small @xmath3 plays a crucial role in stabilizing the doped f - af state with respect to transverse spin fluctuations in the entire brillouin zone . a possible link between orthorhombic distortion and an effective nnn hopping @xmath3",
    "would then explain why this distortion appears necessary for magnetic ordering to be stabilized in iron pnictides .    as the maximal sensitivity of magnon modes to doping",
    "is found along the ferromagnetic direction ( @xmath91-m ) , we have examined their doping dependence at an intermediate wavevector @xmath92 .",
    "a pre - doped level with hole doping @xmath93 was taken to represent the partially - filled band of the parent compound , with electron doping @xmath94 defined as the reduction in hole doping from this level ( representing @xmath95 substitution of @xmath96 in the doped pnictides ) .",
    "3 shows the behaviour of the magnon mode energy with electron doping .",
    "the rapid magnon energy suppression and crossover to negative energy modes indicating destabilization of the f - af state provides an understanding of the observed rapid suppression of magnetic ordering temperature in iron pnictides with electron doping ( due to f substitution of o atoms in @xmath5 or ni substitution of fe atoms in @xmath6).@xcite here , the interaction strength was fixed at @xmath97 in the intermediate coupling regime , and @xmath98 .",
    "the observed reduced magnetic moment in pnictides can be understood in terms of depletion of the predominantly magnetic states .",
    "characteristic of the sdw state , electronic states at the top of the band are significantly more magnetic than states deeper in the band , especially in the weak - coupling limit",
    ". therefore hole doping of these states rapidly diminishes the local magnetic moment @xmath99 , which is reduced to @xmath100 at @xmath101 in fig .",
    "3 . while local moments will get enhanced on filling up these empty magnetic states by electron doping ( f substitution of o ) , the rapidly diminished carrier - induced f nn spin couplings are then unable to sustain the f - af ordering .",
    "this highlights the two distinctly different mechanisms behind the observed reduced magnetic moment and the suppression of magnetic ordering in iron pnictides .",
    "enhanced spin - fluctuation quantum correction in the vicinity of the magnetic instability point ( as in fig .",
    "1 ) is also possibly important in reducing the magnetic moment .",
    "spin waves in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ordered f - af sdw states of the @xmath2 hubbard model were investigated at finite doping in the intermediate coupling regime . including both inter - band and intra - band processes in the particle - hole propagator to obtain the spin - wave propagator which incorporates effective spin couplings , spin - wave dispersion was obtained along different symmetry directions in the brillouin zone .",
    "the f - af state was found to be strongly stabilized at finite hole doping , as evidenced by the rapid crossover from negative to positive spin - wave energies , most noticeably in the f direction .",
    "this stabilization was ascribed mainly to carrier - induced ferromagnetic spin couplings ( along the f chains ) as in metallic ferromagnets , and was found to be strongly enhanced in presence of finite @xmath3 due to band structure saddle point effect .",
    "this calculated doping behaviour is in agreement with the observed rapid suppression of the magnetic order in doped pnictides such as @xmath5 on electron doping arising from f substitution of o atoms .",
    "the doping and @xmath3 dependence of spin waves obtained within the minimal @xmath2 hubbard model accounts for many of the observed magnetic properties of iron pnictides , including anisotropic spin wave velocities , spin wave energy scale , reduced magnetic moment , and rapid suppresion of magnetic ordering with electron doping .",
    "the spin - wave velocity anisotropy is strongly enhanced on electron doping near the instability point .",
    "quantum corrections to spin waves beyond rpa should be of interest in order to incorporate the correlated motion of electrons , as investigated in the metallic ferromagnetic state recently,@xcite and the insulating af state earlier,@xcite incorporating correlation - induced self - energy and vertex corrections within a systematic inverse - degeneracy @xmath102 expansion scheme which preserves spin - rotation symmetry and hence the goldstone mode at each order .    in an orbitally",
    "degenerate metallic ferromagnet , the inter - orbital coulomb interaction ( hund s coupling ) @xmath103 was recently shown to strongly suppress quantum corrections,@xcite particularly for large orbital degeneracy @xmath104 , with the quantum correction magnitude determined by an effective quantum parameter @xmath105 ^ 2 } { [ 1+({\\cal n}-1)(j / u)^2]}$ ] . the renormalized spin stiffness with realistic parameters was obtained in close agreement with the measured spin stiffness for bcc fe . in iron pnictides ,",
    "the reduced effective @xmath104 due to hybridization between ( magnetic ) fe and ( non - magnetic ) as orbitals should enhance quantum corrections and hence suppress ( f - direction ) spin wave energies and the ordering temperature .",
    "these considerations are relevant in view of recent magnetic form factor studies indicating that multiple d orbitals of iron atoms are occupied.@xcite    the magnon energy scale also determines finite temperature magnetic properties .",
    "magnon thermal excitation yields the fall off of magnetization with temperature and , within a self - consistently renormalized spin fluctuation theory , the magnetic ordering temperature .",
    "thus , the rapid suppression of magnon energy with electron doping obtained in this paper accounts for the observed reduction of magnetic ordering temperature on f substitution of o atoms in @xmath106 . furthermore , spatially anisotropic magnetic couplings , with small ratio @xmath107 of interlayer to planar magnetic couplings , reduces the ordering temperature to @xmath108 compared to the isotropic case , which possibly accounts for the low ordering temperature observed in doped pnictides ( @xmath12k ) , as in the layered cuprate antiferromagnet @xmath109 where @xmath110 k and magnon energy scale @xmath111mev , but the nel temperature is only about 400k .",
