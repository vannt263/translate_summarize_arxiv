    "total cross sections  @xcite  of the reaction at excess energies below @xmath0mev are given in figure  [ excitation ] .    at low excess energies",
    "the data points lie significantly above the various expectations indicated by the different lines as long as these predicted curves are all normalized to the disto point  @xcite at @xmath1mev . the pure phase space ( dashed line )",
    "differs by two orders of magnitude at @xmath2mev and a factor of five to ten at @xmath3mev . in comparison to that ,",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath4-fsi ( dashed - dotted red solid line ) by folding its parameterization known from the three body final state with the four body phase space is already closer to the experimental results but does not fully account for the difference .",
    "the solid line representing the calculation within a one - boson exchange model  @xcite reveal a similar discrepancy as the @xmath4-fsi parameterization .",
    "this model includes an energy dependent scattering amplitude derived from the fit of the total cross sections in @xmath5 @xcite while the @xmath4-fsi was not included , yet . up to now",
    ", there is no full calculation available but the new data demands for further theoretical efforts in order to give a complete picture of the @xmath6 production .",
    "an important aspect might be the mass splitting between the neutral @xmath7 and charged @xmath6 kaons being in the order of 8mev . based on the theoretical observation that the opening neutral kaon production channel shows a substantial influence on the @xmath8 transition ( c.f .",
    "figure 2 . in reference @xcite ) , we tried a simple  minded ansatz for the energy dependence of the excitation function for the reaction assuming that with the opening of the neutral kaon channel ( at 8mev excess energy ) some yield is taken out of the charged kaon channel . as long as the total energy is large enough to produce the charged kaon pair but",
    "is below the neutral kaon channel all strength for the associated strangeness production is devoted to the @xmath6 creation . at 8mev excitation energy",
    "the charged channel faces the competition of the neutral one .",
    "for estimating such a coupled channel effect , we postulated the two simple assumptions .",
    "first , we assume that the excitation function for the neutral @xmath9 channel follows exactly the dashed - dotted red solid line in figure [ excitation ] for the charged kaon production case , but shifted by 8mev . if @xmath10 describes the excitation function of the dashed - dotted red solid line , we simply assume that the energy dependence for the neutral channel is given by @xmath11mev ) where @xmath12 refers here to the @xmath6 system .",
    "second , the opening channel is incorporated by the idea that the modified description @xmath13 of the channel is given by a subtraction of the neutral channel via @xmath14 $ ] with an arbitrary normalization @xmath15 .",
    "this is certainly an extreme scenario since the influence of the @xmath16 channel is assumed to be an uncorrelated sum of the @xmath6 and @xmath16 cross sections ; and , since the inverse transition @xmath17 is not considered to take place .",
    "the resulting energy dependence @xmath13 as shown in figure  [ knullknull ] just happens to pass through the experimental data .",
    "this good agreement should be taken with caution since a full coupled channel calculation has to be performed to determine quantitatively the effect of the @xmath16 channel , which is expected to be rather small  @xcite and can not account for the full enhancement seen in the data . furthermore other effects are not considered which should certainly be taken fully into account such as final state interactions between the subsystems @xmath18 and @xmath19 as well as the influence of intermediate resonances .",
