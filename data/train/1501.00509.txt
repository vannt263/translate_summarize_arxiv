    ", we introduce a new approach to understanding the virial coefficients as a weighted sum over tree graphs .",
    "this offers an alternative approach to virial coefficients than those made in the literature .",
    "the virial expansion provides a description of the relationship between macroscopic properties of a system of particles , specifically pressure and density .",
    "the virial expansion may be viewed as a generalisation of the ideal gas law @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 denotes the volume in which the system is contained , @xmath3 is the pressure of the system , @xmath4 is the number of particles in the system , @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath6 is the temperature of the system .",
    "the idea of refining the ideal gas law based on an expansion of pressure as a power series in density was proposed by thiessen @xcite and was first undertaken by kamerlingh onnes in 1901 @xcite .",
    "an important reference for cluster and virial expansions is the book of mayer @xcite , who successfully derived the interpretation of the virial coefficients in terms of weighted two - connected graphs .",
    "much work was done on the virial expansion in the 1950s and 60s , including : the development of kirkwood - salsburg equations @xcite ; the graphical approximation approach of groeneveld @xcite ; deriving inequalities for the thermodynamic functions @xcite ; and bounds obtained from using lagrange inversion on the cluster expansion @xcite .    in the literature , virial expansions have undergone a recent revival .",
    "there are many different approaches to the virial expansion .",
    "these include : a modification of the lebowitz - penrose argument @xcite ; derivations through the canonical ensemble @xcite ; and using differential equations for functions related to the pressure with a uniform repulsive potential @xcite .",
    "there is also the recent paper of morais , procacci and scoppola @xcite for the lennard - jones gas .",
    "furthermore , the recent work of jansen @xcite , provides physical interpretations for the different radii of convergence , emphasising cases in which the virial expansion converges for a larger range of densities than the cluster expansion .",
    "a tree partition scheme for connected graphs was first provided by penrose @xcite .",
    "sokal @xcite and fernndez and procacci @xcite give a more general version and apply it to the potts model and hardcore gases respectively .",
    "this paper develops this partition scheme for two - connected graphs .    providing a weighted tree expression for the virial coefficients should also have consequences for numerical results that have been obtained .",
    "the number of tree graphs grows at a smaller rate than those of two - connected graphs .",
    "indeed , by cayley s formula , we have @xmath7 trees on @xmath8 vertices compared to at least @xmath9 two - connected graphs on @xmath8 vertices .",
    "the lower bound arises from considering the graph corresponding to a cycle on @xmath8 vertices , which is certainly two - connected .",
    "we may add or not any of the remaining @xmath10 edges in the graph to give some subset of two - connected graphs .",
    "the work of ree - hoover @xcite established a method of reducing the number of two - connected graphs that one needs to consider by introducing a factor @xmath11 for every missing edge in each two - connected graph and finding the cancellations that arise from this .",
    "this has led to monte - carlo simulations to give many virial coefficients in the work of clisby and mccoy @xcite .",
    "a practical application of these expressions would be to evaluate the tree versions provided by the expression of virial coefficients in terms of weighted trees .    in future work",
    ", we hope to apply this method to other partition schemes in particular to the scheme indicated by the notion of internally and externally active edges of a matroid @xcite , which is given explicitly in @xcite .",
