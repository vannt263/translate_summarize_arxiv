    "first , we find that @xmath23 has a period that is @xmath53 @xmath54 where @xmath34 is the natural number .",
    "second , being similar to the case that sp are two qubits , when @xmath55 i.e. @xmath56 , sp can influence the entanglement of tp to a great extent .",
    "so we can calculate the analytic expression of the reduced density operator @xmath15 and the entanglement at the time @xmath57 , denoted as @xmath58 , @xmath59 .",
    "obviously , @xmath59 is a function of @xmath60 and by some transformations the parameters can become @xmath61 . for a given value of @xmath62 , there is a pair of @xmath63 that makes the entanglement @xmath59 to the maximal quantity .",
    "considering the complexity of analytical form of @xmath59 , we have to use the numerical method to find the maximal quantity of @xmath59 , denoted as @xmath64 , and @xmath63 matched with @xmath64 to a special @xmath62 .",
    "the picture of @xmath65 and 9 maximal point matched with @xmath66.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    now , we introduce how to find the @xmath64 .",
    "firstly , the area to satisfy the physical condition is very small in the picture of number pair @xmath67 . to show it clearly",
    ", we need to make a transformation @xmath68 the physical region transform in the fig . 3 and a , b , c three points are : +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      +   + from fig . 3",
    "one can see the 9 maximal points are almost on the line ab .",
    "the real equation of frontier ab is very complicated , so we give an approximate one . that is @xmath69    and",
    "the error is small or equal to @xmath70 .",
    "so we can infer that to a special @xmath62 , the point@xmath71 that makes @xmath59 attain to the maximal quantity is approximately on the line ab .",
    "now , you may ask that how @xmath62 is matched with @xmath72 . by some calculations",
    ", we can get a better approximate result @xmath73 its error is small or equal to @xmath74 .",
    "now , if you give a @xmath62 , you can first use eq.(23 ) to get @xmath75 and then lead the result you calculated to the eq.(22 ) and ( 21 ) , then you get the @xmath63 which matched with the maximal @xmath64 . and",
    "the value of @xmath64 can be obtained .",
    "secondly , from the above table , we know point a and b are very special in all of the states .",
    "state a is the maximal entangled state of two qutrits . and the form of state b is likely with the maximal entangled state of two qubits .",
    "but the state b can not elevate the entanglement of tp to unity and only to 0.8 .",
    "now , some interesting things happened . to the case that sp are two qubits",
    ", the entanglement of tp after interaction must attain to 1 when sp are in the maximally entangled state .",
    "but the case that sp are two qutrits is very different from two qubits .",
    "the maximally entangled state of the qutrits can not make all states of tp attain to the maximal state as the fig.4 . shown",
    ".    more interesting is that there does not exist a state that can make the entanglement of state of tp to unity in all states of qutrits .",
    "that means that there is a special state matched with a special @xmath62 that can make the entanglement of states of tp to a maximal quantity which less than 1 .",
    "the details have been shown in fig .",
    "4 .     black real line denotes the initial entanglement of tp ; dashed line denotes the entanglement of tp when @xmath57 after interaction with sp which stay on the a state initially ; dotted line denotes the entanglement of tp when @xmath57 after interaction with sp which stay on the b state initially ; and the red real line denotes the maximal entanglement quantity of tp in all states of qutrits after interaction ; the fold line denotes the process that entanglement of tp initially is 0.2 and attains to 0.96 after interaction with sp 4 times.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    from the fig .",
    "4 , we can see that all states of qutrits can not elevate the entanglement of tp to 1 except the case that when sp is on the state a and the initial state of tp is maximally entangled state .",
    "but , if you want to make the entanglement of tp attain to 1 only using state a , you can make many times just like the fold line in fig.4 has shown .",
    "it is after interacting with sp which stay on state a that the entanglement of tp is from initial 0.2 to 0.62 .",
    "similarly , with 0.62 as the initial value , the entanglement of tp is from 0.62 to 0.82 after interacting with sp which stay on state a again .",
    "doing this operation iteratively , after interacting with sp four times , the entanglement of tp can attain to 0.96 .",
    "in the interaction hamiltonian @xmath76 , the entanglement transfer from sp to tp is investiged .",
    "we mainly focus on two cases .",
    "case 2 : when sp are two qutrits , generally , we can not enhance the entanglement of tp to 1 by the interaction with sp , even if sp is on the maximally entangled state .",
    "more interesting thing is that to a special initial entanglement of tp , there exists a state in all states of qutrits which satisfy the physical condition .",
    "compared with other states of qutrits , this state can make a largest enhancement to the entanglement of tp after interaction . generally , this state is not the maximally entangled state , but it can make tp to a larger entangled state than the maximally entangled state did .    considering this thing carefully , we find that in the case 1 , the maximal entanglement of tp after interaction has no relation with the initial state of tp and always can attain to 1 to all initial states of tp , as long as sp stay on the maximally entangled state initially . in the case 2 , the maximal entanglement of tp after interaction is relative to the initial state of tp and always can not attain to 1 to all states of tp except one condition that the initial state of tp and sp is the maximally entangled states . but",
    "this case is useless . because the initial state of tp is already the maximally",
    "entangled state , it is not necessary to interact with sp .",
    "therefore , we only have interest on the initial state of tp which is not maximally entangled state .    from the above discussion",
    ", we find that there are some differences between case 1 and case 2 .",
    "firstly , the relation between the maximal entanglement of tp after interaction and the entanglement of tp initially is different .",
    "secondly , the behavior and function of maximally entangled state is different in the entanglement transfer process .",
    "our next work is to give the reason that brings about those differences exactly .",
    "now , we consider the reason from two aspects . on the one hand ,",
    "the difference derives from the form of interaction .",
    "so we will use more general form of interaction , for example @xmath77 . and we will adjust the quantity of those parameters and see whether the difference will vanish or not . on the other hand , we conjecture that the difference of entanglement between qubits and qutrits lead to those differences . as we all know",
    ", there does not exist a well concept to describe the entanglement of two qutrits .",
    "we expect to find a proper and general definition of entanglement of two qutrits based on the entanglement transfer to obtain the essential reason ."
