    "deep water gravity - capillary waves are relevant in a range of applications , including the understanding of the generation of waves by wind and the interpretation of satellite remote sensing data ( see , for example @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the study of solitary waves in this regime is of particular theoretical interest since it is _ only _ under the joint effects of surface tension and gravity that localised water waves in three - dimensions have been found in the water wave problem .",
    "such localised waves have recently been observed in the experiments of @xcite . in the deep water limit , these gravity - capillary ( gc )  wavepacket \" solitary waves are of a fundamentally different nature from  long \" solitary waves which are described approximately by the korteweg  de vries ( kdv ) , kadomtsev - petviashvilli ( kp ) and related equations in shallow water .",
    "the later bifurcate from linear waves at zero wavenumber whereas the former bifurcate at a finite wavenumber , and hence their oscillatory nature .",
    "these oscillatory solitary waves were seen by @xcite and @xcite to be approximately described by solitary wave solutions of the focussing nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation which governs the slowly varying envelope of monochromatic waves . in this regime",
    ", @xcite observed that if the phase speed ( the speed of crests of the carrier wave ) and the group speed ( the speed of the envelope ) are equal , the solitary waves of nls will describe approximately solitary waves in the primitive fluid equations .",
    "it is simple to show that at a minimum of the phase - speed , group and phase speed coincide , and that this occurs at nonzero wavenumber in gc waves for sufficiently deep water .",
    "( the condition is that the bond number be less than 1/3 which roughly corresponds to a depth greater than a centimetre in the air - water problem . )    in a two dimensional fluid domain ( corresponding to a one dimensional free - surface and henceforth denoted as the ` 1d problem ' ) , wavepacket solitary waves were first computed in the full fluid equations by @xcite and by @xcite . in three - dimensions ( with a two - dimensional free - surface , denoted the ` 2d problem ' ) , the first computations of steady solitary waves were by @xcite , with related work by @xcite and @xcite on reduced equations . due to the highly oscillatory and spatially extended nature of these waves , accurate computations are challenging .",
    "localised waves on a two - dimensional water surface are often called  lumps \" , a name carried over from their shallow water counterparts which can be approximated by the localised ",
    "lump \" solutions of the kp equation , but we refer to them as wavepacket solitary waves . in this paper",
    "we focus only on the infinite depth case since for a water - air interface , any gc dynamics in water deeper than a few centimetres is essentially in the infinite depth regime . in this regime for an air - water interface ,",
    "the waves bifurcate with a carrier wavelength of approximately 1.7 cm . and",
    "a speed of 23 cm./sec .",
    "the stability and dynamics of gc solitary waves in deep water has only recently been studied . in the 1d problem ,",
    "@xcite studied the question of linear stability and @xcite studied the time - dependent evolution of solitary waves ( stability and collisions ) in full potential flow . in 2d , there are far fewer studies .",
    "the transverse instability of line solitary waves ( solitary waves of the 1d problem trivially extended in the transverse variable ) has been considered by @xcite and others .",
    "line solitary waves are unstable to transverse perturbations of sufficiently long wavelength .",
    "fully 2d dynamics have been considered by @xcite in a one - way simplified model and in a quadratic isotropic model in @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to study 2d dynamics within a close approximation of the euler equations . a simplification that we make , suggested and used in @xcite for 1d time - dependent solutions , is to take a cubic truncation of the scaled dirichlet - to - neuman operator that appears in the free - surface boundary conditions .",
    "( one important difference from the model of @xcite is that we use the full surface tension term which results in a considerably better approximation of the full equations at larger amplitudes . )",
    "the approximation proposed is the simplest model that can _ quantitatively _ capture small and moderate amplitude euler nonlinear cg solitary wave dynamics - a claim we support with 1d comparisons .    the focussing two - dimensional cubic nls equation is central to the understanding of the existence and stability of these solitary waves .",
    "we shall see that this equation can be used to correctly predict the existence and certain instabilities of line and wave packet solitary waves , but does not capture the larger amplitude stability characteristics , the asymptotic dynamics of unstable waves nor the interaction of solitary waves .",
    "( the situation in 1d is worse , since the nls does not even capture the instabilities of arbitrarily small waves correctly - see for example , @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ formulation ] we briefly present the derivation of the cubic truncation model we shall use and discuss what can be learned about the solitary waves from the associated nls equation . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the numerical results : 1d comparisons between the cubic model and the full problem , followed by 2d bifurcation diagrams , and stability and collision calculations . in section [ extensions ]",
    "we briefly introduce variations on the cubic model , principally the addition of forcing and dissipation and treating the finite depth problem .",

    "let @xmath0 denote the horizontal plane , @xmath1 the vertical direction and @xmath2 time .",

    "we shall henceforth call this model the cubic dirichelet - to - neumann euler equations ( cdtne ) .",

    "traditionally , weakly nonlinear wavepackets are studied using the resulting cubic nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) for the modulational regime of monochromatic waves .",

    "can then be found to satisfy the nls equation ( @xcite ) @xmath43 it is a trivial fact that substituting the same ansatz into the equations ( [ zcs3a ] ) , ( [ zcs3b ] ) instead yields an nls equation with identical coefficients - which is the motivation for choosing at least a cubic truncation of the dtn operator .",

    "the coefficients of nls are given by @xmath47 the solution to the original system is then as follows @xmath48 where @xmath49 .",
    "since the nls equation ( [ nls ] ) is of the elliptic or focussing type with solitary wave solutions in both one and two dimensions , and since the phase and group speed are equal at the chosen carrier wave , one can expect small amplitude solitary waves bifurcating from a uniform flow .",
    "these solitary waves of ( [ zcs3a],[zcs3b ] ) can be approximated by the nls solitary waves found by solving the elliptic eigenvalue problem for @xmath50 and @xmath51 @xmath52 this is obtained by setting @xmath53 . denoting @xmath54",

    "an interesting particularity is that the physical energy for two dimensional wavepacket solitary waves is predicted to tend to a _",
    "finite _ value of 12.04 as the amplitude approaches zero , which we shall verify in the cdtne model .",
    "this is purely a consequence of scaling : the radially symmetric envelope s area is proportional to @xmath64 exactly countering the effect of decreasing amplitude of the wave whose energy density is @xmath65 .",
    "shallow water lump solutions of kp ( a valid approximation when the bond number is greater than 1/3 ) do not have this property",
    ". the higher energy states of the eigenvalue problem ( [ nonlinev ] ) can be associated with different families of travelling waves of the cdtne model resulting in a remarkable  quantisation \" of the energy of solitary gc waves in the 2d problem .",
    "the numerical solution of the cdtne system is implemented on a periodic domain with fourier pseudo - spectral methods , where all derivatives and hilbert transforms are computed in fourier space with spectral accuracy , while nonlinearities are computed pseudo - spectrally in real space . for traveling waves ,",
    "the resulting algebraic system for the fourier coefficients is solved using newton s method using a monochromatic wave modulated by the solution to ( [ nonlinev ] ) as initial guesses .",
    "the branches are computed through straightforward continuation methods . for time integration of the system ,",
    "a classic fourth order runge - kutta method is used with the integrating factor method ( see @xcite for details ) used to exactly integrate the linear part of the equation .",
    "the conserved quantities of the system are monitored and in all cases are preserved to a relative error of at most @xmath66 .",
    "all the computations are de - aliased with a doubling of fourier modes . for two dimensional computations at least @xmath67",
    "modes are used along the propagating and transverse directions respectively .",
    "it is often the small amplitude solutions that are most difficult to compute accurately since the spatial decay of those solutions is much slower .",
    "thus , the computational the domain is gradually enlarged as the amplitude becomes smaller .",
    "the bifurcation diagrams of 1d gravity - capillary solitary waves for the full equations in deep water have been presented in @xcite and others . in figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we compare the speed - amplitude and speed - energy bifurcation diagrams of the cdtne model to these and to the theoretical prediction of nls . there , and elsewhere , we use either @xmath11 at the centre of the wave or the energy @xmath68 as the amplitude parameter .",
    "the cdtne model agrees well with the bifurcation picture for the euler equations far beyond the nls regime .",
    "typical profiles of the depression and elevation branches of waves are show in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "the model is remarkably accurate : at relatively large amplitudes which are far from the nls regime the relative difference in profile between the full equations and the model are of order @xmath69 and not visually discernible .",
    "although a quantitative comparison of time - dependent dynamics is involved and beyond the scope of this paper ( in particular methods used to solve the full equations usually do not use a uniform grid in @xmath70 ) , we show an example of the inelastic overtaking collision of two solitary waves computed with the full equations ( reported in @xcite ) and cdtne truncation in figure [ figure1dtdcomp ] .",
    "the results are extremely close and we see this as further evidence that the cdtne model is an accurate representation of the euler equations in a broad amplitude range of the cg regime . comparisons that we have made with the cubic model of @xcite show that retaining the full nonlinearity of the surface tension term is far more important than the nonlinearity associated with higher order corrections of the dirichelet to neumann map .",
    "one may conjecture that the surface tension term has a strong regularising effect that implies fast convergence of the dtn power series approximation throughout the evolution .",
    "two - dimensional gc solitary waves of the full equations in infinite depth were first computed in @xcite using finite differences and boundary integral methods .",
    "a more resolved computation was performed by p@xmath71r@xmath71u and reported in @xcite .",
    "however , this later computation is , in our opinion , also under - resolved , particularly at small amplitudes where the waves are highly oscillatory and spatially extended , as it deviates considerably from both the cdtne and the nls results .",
    "figure [ figbif2d ] shows the bifurcation diagram of gc solitary waves , as obtained from numerical solutions of the cdtne , full potential flow ( as computed by p@xmath71r@xmath71u and reported in @xcite ) , and both the leading order and leading order plus first correction of the nls approximation .",
    "we conjecture that the cdtne would be in quantitative agreement with full potential flow in the 2d problem given the accuracy of results at moderate amplitude in the 1d case , and the agreement with nls approximations at small amplitude .",
    "the discrepancy between the full euler results and the expected amplitudes predicted by nls had been noted in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we note that the cdtne wave packets have finite energy at their bifurcation point , as predicted by nls but which can not be verified in the full euler computations at current resolution ( p@xmath71r@xmath71u , private communication ) .",
    "typical profiles of the elevation and depression waves corresponding to the bifurcation curves presented in figure [ figbif2d ] are shown in figure [ figprofiles2d ] .",
    "all solutions presented so far are those whose profile envelope at bifurcation is described by the ground state eigenfunction of ( [ nonlinev ] ) . in the 2d problem",
    ", we have also computed cdtne solitary wave solutions whose envelope is approximated by radially symmetric higher modes .",
    "for example in figure [ figmode2 ] we show the unstable evolution of the complicated travelling wave resulting from the solitary wave assigned to the second radial mode of ( [ nonlinev ] ) ( the wave is shown in the top - left panel of figure [ figmode2 ] ) .",
    "this wave has an energy of 79.39 at bifurcation , much higher than the ground state .",
    "non - radially symmetric solutions to ( [ nonlinev ] ) are discussed in @xcite , but we did not attempt to compute solitary waves whose envelopes are not radially symmetric .",
    "there are a few known results that guide us in a numerical study of 2d stability problem .",
    "first , it is known that both depression and elevation plane solitary waves ( 1d waves extended in the second dimension ) are linearly unstable with respect to sufficiently long small perturbations in the transverse direction .",
    "this has been shown both within an nls approximation @xcite and using arguments based on linearization of the full equations @xcite .",
    "second , in 2d the underlying focussing nls equation ( [ nls ] ) is well known to exhibit a finite - time focussing blowup called wave collapse when , in an unbounded setting , the initial conserved energy @xmath72 , is negative ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "( note that this energy is not the same one arising from the cdtne equations . )",
    "the result is obtained by a virial argument , whence @xmath73 is conserved and @xmath74 satisfies @xmath75 .",
    "solitary waves which are solutions to the eigenvalue problem ( [ nonlinev ] ) are critical with @xmath76 .",
    "thus , a small negative energy perturbation leads to focussing and blowup and a positive energy perturbation leads to spreading of the underlying wave envelope .",
    "we thus expect , and will confirm numerically , the instability of localised solitary wave solutions for nonzero envelope energy perturbations in the near - nls limit of the cdtne model ( where solitary wave envelopes are well approximated by the nls ) .",
    "we note that the simple virial argument is not available in a periodic setting ( see @xcite ) but nevertheless seems to predict stability very well in our computations on periodic domains .",
    "third , both elevation and depression wave branches have critical point in their speed - energy relation ( see figure [ figbif2d ] ) , which can lead to an exchange of linear stability of the eigenfunction of the linearized problem associated to the translational invariance symmetry ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "this is the instability commonly observed in small amplitude elevation waves of the 1d problem leading to the eventual development of a depression wave @xcite .",
    "all figures of solitary wave dynamics presented are shown is a frame moving with the speed of the wave that was used construct the initial data . in this frame",
    "the main features of the wave evolve slowly .    for plane solitary waves ,",
    "the linear analysis based on nls ( see @xcite ) shows that the transverse perturbation @xmath77 is unstable , when the wave number @xmath78 in the @xmath79 direction satisfies @xmath80 we confirm this in our numerical experiments where a plane solitary wave is perturbed with four transverse perturbations of different wavelengths and the subsequent nonlinear evolution is compared .",
    "the perturbation wavenumbers are @xmath81 , and @xmath82 respectively .",
    "as shown in figure [ figtransins ] the first two perturbations do not destabilise the plane wave whereas the next two do .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the instability shows a focussing behaviour reminiscent of the underlying collapse dynamics of nls as shown in figure [ figtransevol ] .",
    "this intermediate time focussing is arrested by the generation of a travelling _ breather _ : a propagating periodic - in - time localised structure .",
    "this structure is best described as a localised depression solitary wave with periodic amplitude modulation , and which appears to be stable ( see evolution for @xmath83 in figure [ figtransins ] ) in all our experiments .",
    "these breathers are very common and also occur in the nonlinear evolution of instabilities of small amplitude fully localised solitary waves below .    throughout our computations in this section ,",
    "instabilities and wave interactions will invariably lead to some high frequency dispersive radiation and thus , due to our use of a periodic domain , the remaining coherent structures are embedded in a  sea \" of linear ripples .",
    "this is visible in most computations and can also be seen as further evidence of the stability of the resulting structures .",
    "the stability of localised traveling waves is considered next .",
    "first , the virial argument sketched above implies that near the bifurcation point , both elevation and depression solitary waves are linearly unstable .",
    "the virial argument would predict eventual blowup for negative energy perturbations and this is not observed , in all cases the blowup is arrested by the generation of a larger amplitude breather .",
    "dispersive spreading consistent with the envelope spreading predicted by the virial argument is observed for positive energy perturbations . in the computations that we present",
    "we perturb the exact solitary wave solution by a small multiple of itself , by taking initial data @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the computed travelling wave . since , for the perturbed wave , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the envelope of the solitary wave , negative energy perturbations correspond to @xmath88 and positive energy ones to @xmath89 . in the left panel of figure [ deplumpstab ]",
    "we show the typical evolution of the amplitude for a perturbed small amplitude depression solitary wave . for a negative energy perturbation we see focussing arrested by the formation of a breather whereas for positive energy the amplitude decreases monotonically as a result of dispersive spreading .",
    "the case shown is for a depression wave , however the elevation wave dynamics is broadly similar . in figure [ figbreather ]",
    "we show four snapshots of the breather evolution resulting from the unstable small amplitude depression wave at later times .    for a large class of problems , linear stability may change at a critical point of @xmath90 , the speed - energy curve .",
    "this necessary condition for instability was observed by @xcite , for gravity waves and has since been extended to many other situations .",
    "@xcite present an application of this result to a wavepacket solitary wave in a model equation . in the present problem",
    ", both depression and elevation waves have critical points in @xmath90 .",
    "we denote solitary waves with speed lower than this critical speed  large amplitude \" and those with speed larger than it  small amplitude \" since in all our computations amplitude is a monotonic function of speed . small amplitude waves bifurcation diagram and linear stability",
    "are well described by the nls equation whereas large amplitude waves are not .",
    "our numerical simulations show that for depression waves , the exchange of stability does take place at the minimum point in @xmath90 .",
    "the evolution of large amplitude depression waves amplitudes when subject to perturbations is shown in the right panel of figure [ deplumpstab ] .",
    "the waves are stable regardless of the sign of @xmath91 .",
    "solitary waves ( or breathers which are small perturbations of the solitary waves ) propagate in the midst of small linear dispersive waves that have been shed by the perturbed initial data .",
    "all our computations show that elevation waves remain unstable at large amplitude . in figure [ figuneleprof ]",
    "an unstable large elevation solitary wave subject to a smallnegative energy perturbation and evolves into a depression breather .",
    "similarly , positive energy perturbations will also yield depression breathers ( whose energy is much smaller than the elevation waves ( see figure [ figbif2d ] ) .",
    "the instability is initially similar to that of a 1d depression wave ( see @xcite ) : a symmetry breaking whereby the leading trough grows at the expense of the trailing one ( this instability is associated to the translational invariance mentioned above ) .",
    "what follows is collapse focussing that is arrested by the formation of a depression breather .    from our calculations , we believe there are families of periodic ( breather ) solutions of different periods and amplitude for each fixed energy above the minimum of the depression solitary waves .",
    "the orbits of these breathers in phase space are centred around the fixed point of stable depression solitary waves and the precise bifurcation diagram for them would require computing exact periodic localised structures which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "a summary of the stability results in this section is shown in table [ table ] .",
    ".summary of stability results [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]",
    "lastly we compute the evolution of a complex solitary wave of the cdtne equations corresponding to a higher mode of the nonlinear eigenvalue problem discussed previously , and this is shown in figure [ figmode2 ] . in this case",
    "all perturbations triggered rapid instabilities , but the nonlinear evolution shows a remarkable dynamics with eventual focussing into four depression breathers of different amplitudes .      given the stability of large amplitude depression waves , we have numerically computed their collisions .",
    "we have only computed head - on and overtaking collisions of pairs of waves although in a 2d problem there is a wide range of possible collision scenarios . for head - on collisions ,",
    "the interaction time between the two waves is insufficient for any strong nonlinear effect to take place and we have only observed very small oscillations that result from the small inelasticity of the collision . the waves essentially traverse each other .",
    "the more interesting case is the overtaking collision .",
    "here , the small difference in solitary wave speeds implies that the calculations must be carried out over long times . in the 1d problem collisions",
    "were of two types of inelastic collisions @xcite : collisions where both waves survived and collisions where only the larger wave survived when their amplitude difference was large .",
    "here , we have only observed quasi - elastic collisions where both waves survive and the primary effect of the overtaking collision is a rapid and large phase shift of the order of one envelope wavelength .",
    "figure [ colldd ] shows the before and after free surface profiles of the waves and figure [ collddc ] shows the resulting waves trajectories in @xmath92 space .",
    "the collisions are weakly inelastic and the wave amplitude is mildly attenuated with some dispersive radiation present during the collision .",
    "there are several extensions of the model which , while the detailed study is beyond the scope of this paper , may be useful in studying problems of this type .",
    "we have considered fluids of infinite depth only ( which in the case of gc flows in water is a good approximation for depths exceeding a few centimetres ) .",
    "if the effect of finite depth is required , the formulation can be modified simply by taking @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the mean depth of the fluid normalised by the capillary gravity length scale and is inversely related to the bond number . in particular the shallow water lump dynamics modelled by the kadomtsev - petviashvilli ( kp ) equation should be recovered when the bond number is greater than @xmath95 .",
    "given the small length scales of the waves , it may also be of practical interest to add the effects of viscosity and forcing . in the analysis of their experiments @xcite adjusted a simple one - way model proposed in @xcite by adding forcing and a viscous damping .",
    "the more accurate cdtne equations can be modified to include small viscous damping effects by using the approximation presented in @xcite whereby dissipation is modelled through the modification of both kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions : @xmath96\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{1}{2}\\big[(g_0\\xi)\\big(g_0\\xi-2g_0\\eta g_0\\xi-2\\eta\\delta\\xi\\big)-|\\nabla\\xi|^2\\big].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath97 is the pressure forcing and the reynolds number , which controls the dissipation rate , is given by @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid . for the case of an air - water interface in the regime that we considered in this paper , we obtain a reynolds number of approximately 500 .    for small amplitude waves , the variation in the transverse direction is not significant compared to that in the propagation direction .",
    "one can therefore propose to assume this a priori and simplify the system by deleting all the nonlinear terms which include y - derivatives obtaining a  weakly transversal \" model which still has the same nls equation describing wave packets as the full problem .",
    "the hamiltonian for this model reads @xmath100=\\int\\:\\frac{1}{2}\\xi\\big(g_0+\\overline{g}_1 + \\overline{g}_2\\big)\\xi+\\frac{1}{2}\\eta^2 + \\frac12\\eta_y^2 + \\big(\\sqrt{1+\\eta_x^2}\\big)\\:dxdy\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath101 calculations performed with this approximation show excellent agreement with cdtne at small amplitudes and only qualitative agreement for larger amplitude solitary waves .",
    "the dynamics of gravity - capillary solitary waves on the surface of three - dimensional fluid was studied .",
    "the only approximation made was a cubic truncation of a scaled dirichelet to neumann map that provides the normal velocity of the free - surface given its tangential velocity . in two dimensions , where comparisons to the untruncated problem ( i.e. fully nonlinear free - surface potential flow ) can be accurately measured , this truncation is remarkably accurate in modelling small and moderate amplitude waves .",
    "we conjecture that the same is true in three - dimensions .",
    "there are undoubtedly in this problem infinitely many branches of solitary travelling wave solutions as this is the prediction of the associated envelope nls analysis about the bifurcation point .",
    "we compute examples of three of them : elevation and depression solitary waves arising from the simplest eigenfunction of the nls problem and a more complex wave arising from a higher eigenfunction of the same problem .",
    "the localised solitary waves have the surprising property that as their amplitude ( from peak to trough ) decreases to zero as the bifurcation point is approached , their physical energy tends to a finite positive value , quantised by the different eigenfunctions of the nls equation .",
    "the instability and subsequent evolution for one dimensional line solitary waves and the various two dimensional solitary waves have been explored numerically by perturbing the waves and computing the solution through accurate pseudo spectral based methods .",
    "all solitary waves are found to be unstable with the notable exception of larger amplitude depression waves .",
    "these waves together with travelling breathers , which are periodic travelling cycles oscillating about these travelling states , are stable and appear to be attractors in the long time evolution of the problem .",
    "the focussing nls equation adequately predicts the bifurcation and linear stability properties of small amplitude solitary cg waves .",
    "the collapse singularity of initial data , however , is not observed in our computations leading to the conjecture that an appropriate envelope model for this problem is a cubic - quintic nls equation where the quintic term is defocussing .",
    "we thank dr e. p@xmath71r@xmath71u for making available more resolved numerical results solitary waves .",

    "<S> the dynamics of solitary gravity - capillary water waves propagating on the surface of a three - dimensional fluid domain is studied numerically . in order to accurately compute complex time dependent solutions , we simplify the full potential flow problem by taking a cubic truncation of the scaled dirichlet - to - neumann operator for the normal velocity on the free surface . </S>",
    "<S> this approximation agrees remarkably well with the full equations for the bifurcation curves , wave profiles and the dynamics of solitary waves for a two - dimensional fluid domain . </S>",
    "<S> fully localised solitary waves are then computed in the three - dimensional problem and the stability and interaction of both line and localized solitary waves are investigated via numerical time integration of the equations . </S>",
    "<S> the solitary wave branches are indexed by their finite energy at small amplitude , and the dynamics of the solitary waves is complex involving nonlinear focussing of wave packets , quasi - elastic collisions , and the generation of propagating , spatially localised , time - periodic structures ( breathers ) . </S>"
