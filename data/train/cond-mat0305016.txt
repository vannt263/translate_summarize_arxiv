    "a material interacting with the intense light of a laser beam responds in a `` nonlinear fashion '' .",
    "consequences of this are a number of peculiar phenomena , including the generation of optical frequencies that are initially absent .",
    "this effect allows the production of laser light at wave lengths normally unattainable by conventional laser techniques .",
    "so the application of nonlinear optics ( nlo ) range from basic research to spectroscopy , telecommunications and astronomy .",
    "second harmonic generation ( shg ) , in particular , corresponds to the appearance of a frequency component in the laser beam that is exactly twice the input one .",
    "shg has great potential as a characterization tool for materials , because of its sensitivity to symmetry .",
    "today shg is widely applied for studying the surfaces and interfaces because it requires an inversion asymmetric material . for materials with bulk inversion symmetry shg",
    "is only allowed at surfaces and interfaces .",
    "this makes shg a powerful surface selective technique .",
    "shg in conjunction with kerr and faraday rotation@xcite is used as an excellent tool for studying magnetic surfaces . in case of embedded interfaces",
    "this technique gains extra weight when an intense laser is used which is capable of penetrating deep into the material and no direct contact with the sample is needed .    in the case of linear optical transitions",
    "an electron absorbs a photon from the incoming light and makes a transition to the next higher unoccupied allowed state .",
    "when this electron relaxes it emits a photon of frequency less than or equal to the frequency of the incident light ( fig .",
    "shg on the other hand is a two photon process where this excited electron absorbs another photon of same frequency and makes a transition to yet another allowed state at higher energy .",
    "this electron when falling back to its original state emits a photon of a frequency which is two times that of the incident light ( fig .",
    "this results in the frequency doubling in the output .        in order to extend the use of nlo for understanding the properties of surfaces and interfaces and for extracting maximal information from such measurements for non centero - symmetric materials ,",
    "a more quantitative theoretical analysis is required .",
    "the calculation of the shg susceptibility from first principles is an important but difficult task .",
    "the major work in this direction for semiconductors can be found in refs . and for metals in refs . and",
    "references there in . in this work",
    ", we present the formalism for calculating the second order susceptibility @xmath0 for non magnetic semiconductors and insulators , within the independent particle approximation .",
    "the expressions formulated are amenable for numerical calculations using any band structure method and are computationally more efficient@xcite than the previously presented expressions .",
    "@xcite    as an example , we present the linear and nonlinear optical properties of a inp / gap superlattice ( sl ) . semiconducting strained sls",
    "are potential materials for applications in optical communications involving switching , amplification and signal processing . in particular iii - v semiconductor hetero - structures and sls",
    "have attracted a great deal of interest mainly due to the possibility of tailoring band gaps and band structures by variation of simple parameters like superlattice period , growth direction and substrate material .",
    "much of the theoretical work done to understand the physical properties of sls has been largely concerned with the understanding of the electronic band structure .",
    "for example , the effect of strain on the band gap , the band offset problem and the possibilities of engineering it as well as the interface energy and band structure have been studied .",
    "@xcite the major theoretical work in the direction of nlo properties was done by ghahramani _",
    "et al_. @xcite they employed the non - self consistent linear - combination - of - gaussian - orbitals ( lcgo ) method to calculate the band structures and optical properties of sls . as an example , we present a fully self - consistent calculation of the nonlinear optical properties of the mono - layer inp / gap ( 110 ) superlattice ( sl ) .",
    "the structure in the linear optical spectra is identified from the band structure of the material .",
    "the features in the second - order optical response are further analyzed in terms of resonances of the peaks in the linear optical spectra .",
    "with use of the strain corrected effective - medium - model ( scemm ) , @xcite and we identify the features in the optical spectra of inp / gap coming from the sl formation .    the paper is arranged in the following manner . in section",
    "ii we present the detailed formalism for calculating the shg susceptibility . section iii deals with the linear and second - order optical response of an inp / gap sl",
    "the aim of the present work is to obtain the expressions for the optical response of a material .",
    "the effect of the electric field vector @xmath1 of the incoming light is to polarize the material .",
    "this polarization can be calculated using the following relation : @xmath2 in this expression @xmath3 is the linear optical susceptibility and @xmath4 is the second order optical susceptibility .",
    "the higher order terms can also be calculated but in the present work we are only interested up to the second - order optical response .",
    "the formulae for calculating the shg susceptibility , @xmath0 , have been presented before.@xcite in the present work we provide the detailed formalism . before deriving the expressions for calculating the shg susceptibility using perturbation theory , a brief background of the single and many particle hamiltonians and operators is needed .",
