    "<S> we report a model study of the phonon response on the interplay of the superconducting ( sc ) gap and both static and dynamic jahn - teller distortion and predict the appearance of the sc and jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion gap excitation peaks in the raman spectra of high - t@xmath0 superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the model consists of the hamiltonian containing static jt interaction and @xmath1-wave type sc interaction in the conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> further the phonons are coupled to the density of the conduction electron in the band as well as to the jt split conduction band giving rise to dynamic jahn - teller ( djt ) interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the phonons are considered in a harmonic approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon green s function is calculated by zubarev s technique and the phonon self - energy arising due to normal electron - phonon ( ep ) interaction and djt interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon self - energy arising due to this is calculated from the electron response density function in the coexistence phase of the two order parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon spectral density predicts two excitation peaks , one due to sc gap and the other due to jt distortion . </S>",
    "<S> the djt coupling suppresses the jt gap while it enhances sc gap as well as sc transition temperature . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of these excitation peaks are investigated by varying different model parameters of the system . </S>"
