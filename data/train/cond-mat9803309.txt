    "it turns out that the actions can be very well approximated by linear functions in the surface parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the radius of the cluster .",

    "more surprisingly the electronic shell structure as revealed by @xmath2 can not be found in any _ single _ contributions to the total energy .",

    "the integration over @xmath57 is again done in the semiclassical limit . here",
    "the stationary - phase condition requires that the final moment equals the initial moment .",
    "the limit @xmath66 finally closes the orbits .",
    "thus , since the orbits return to @xmath57 with the same momentum , they are closed in phase space , i.e.   they are periodic .",
    "there are two distinct classes of such orbits .",
    "the first consists of only the _ direct path _ , the length of which vanishes as @xmath66 .",
    "it consequently is _ local _ and gives rise to the thomas - fermi density of states @xmath67 .",
    "the second class consists of periodic orbits of finite length .",
    "these _ non - local _ paths give rise to a quantum - correction to @xmath67 .",

    "to parameterize all the different orientations of the linear orbits it is sufficient to give the coordinates of one of their outer turning points . since for a spherical potential",
    "well the outer turning point lies on the surface of a sphere , the manifold of the linear orbits has dimension 2 .",
    "all the higher orbits are not linear but lie in a plane , so we need an additional parameter to fix the orientation of this plane .",
    "the manifold of the planar orbits are therefore 3-dimensional ( ` there are many more planar than linear orbits ' ) . thus the linear orbits do not contribute to the leading order of the periodic orbit expansion .",
    "the largest amplitudes are found for the triangular @xmath86 and the square @xmath87 orbit .",
    "the contribution from other orbits is , however , still large , i.e.  one has to include many periodic orbits in a partial summation of ( [ dos_poe ] ) before one obtains a result close to @xmath1 .",

    "[ alpha ] , a finite value of @xmath91 serves to reduce the contribution of higher orbits considerably .",

    "as we will see , such an expansion converges much more rapidly than that for the density of states .",
    "we therefore need not introduce any smoothing .      to find a periodic orbit expansion for the oscillating part @xmath2 of the total energy using the poe for @xmath1",

    "the shift in the shell ( supershell ) oscillations is given by @xmath212 . as we can see from ( [ dphi ] )",

    "we would expect perturbation theory to break down when the shifts of the energy levels are of the order of their spacing .",
    "for the potentials we have considered here the change in the energy levels is quite large , especially for the levels with high angular momentum , which are most sensitive to the potential at the surface .",
    "typical shifts of the energy levels with the surface width @xmath3 for a set of woods - saxon potentials are shown in fig .",

    "nevertheless , the electronic shells are not that strongly affected , because the levels with large angular momentum , which are mostly responsible for the oscillations in the total energy , are shifted by large , but similar amounts .",

    "the approximation is very good even for rather large surface widths @xmath3 . for the square orbit the expansion still works well ,",
