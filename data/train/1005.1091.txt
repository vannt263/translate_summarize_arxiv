    "inhomogeneous cosmological models @xcite have recently attracted much attention because , among other things , some of them may potentially be useful in explaining the observed universe s acceleration without resorting to dark energy .",
    "thus , it is important to put them on the test independently of the phenomenon itself for which they have been purposely introduced .    in the framework of the general theory of relativity , the most general form of the line element @xmath9 of a spherically symmetric inhomogeneous space - time in which the source in the einstein s field equations is",
    "a perfect fluid is , in has only the time component , i.e. @xmath10 . if the vector field @xmath11 has zero rotation , as it happens if the space - time is spherically symmetric and the metric obeys the einstein equations with a perfect fluid source , the comoving coordinates can be chosen so that they are synchronous , i.e. in them the metric tensor has no off - diagonal components @xmath12 . ]",
    "comoving - synchronous spherical coordinates @xmath13 @xcite , ( ds)^2 = e^(r , t)(cdt)^2-e^(r , t)(dr)^2 - ^2(r , t)[(d)^2+^2(d)^2 ] . in order to solve the resulting einstein field equations ,",
    "an equation of state has to be assumed .",
    "the most natural choice consists of setting the pressure equal to zero , corresponding to a dust evolution driven by gravitation only . from the equations of motion of a perfect fluid it turns out that , for @xmath14 , the dust moves along timelike geodesics . as a consequence , @xmath15 and , for denotes the partial derivative of @xmath16 with respect to @xmath17 . ]",
    "@xmath18 , e^=,where @xmath19 is an arbitrary function such that @xmath20 for all @xmath17 in order to preserve the right signature of the metric of .",
    "the resulting space - time line element is the so - called lematre - tolman - bondi ( ltb ) model .",
    "indeed , such spherically symmetric inhomogeneous dust models were first discovered by @xcite and further studied by @xcite and @xcite ; for a detailed discussion of several properties see @xcite .",
    "such models are among the best known and most useful exact solutions of einstein s equations .",
    "since they allow us to examine non - linear effects analytically , or at least in a tractable way , there is an extensive literature using them mostly to describe cosmological inhomogeneities @xcite , but also as in other theoretical contexts , such as gravitational collapse @xcite and censorship of singularities @xcite or quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "several authors considered ltb models as tools to probe how the cosmic acceleration associated to recent observations can be accounted for inhomogeneities , without introducing dark energy @xcite .",
    "ltb models are also a standard choice to apply buchert s scalar averaging formalism @xcite , in which the effects of dark energy could be mimicked by terms .",
    "see @xcite for a comprehensive review of such aspects .",
    "here we are interested in putting constraints in a phenomenological way on some parameters of the ltb metric from its local tidal effects on the dynamics of test bodies of the solar system . to this aim",
    ", it is necessary to set up a standard orthonormal tetrad frame parallel transported along the worldline of a fundamental observer representing , in this case , the sun , and explicitly derive the expression of the ltb metric in such a local fermi frame .",
    "this has been recently done by @xcite . in general , the motion of test bodies can be studied in such fermi coordinate systems following ideas and methods developed by @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ dua ]",
    "we analytically work out the ltb effects on the orbital motion of a test particle in the local fermi frame and compare them with some results present in literature . in section [ tria ]",
    "we compare our theoretical predictions to different types of bodies and data of the solar system to phenomenologically put constraints on @xcite @xmath21 entering the ltb metric written in terms of the fermi coordinates of a fundamental observer .",
    "concerning their values infered from cosmological data , from ( 62)-(64 ) by @xcite it turns out that , in proximity of the origin of the local fermi frame , i.e. for @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are rather similar being of the order of means that both @xmath23 and @xmath24 have approximately the same values . ]",
    "k_1/2q_0 h_0 ^ 2.in it @xcite h_0=71.0  km s^-1  mpc^-1=2.310 ^ -18  s^-1is the present value of the hubble parameter , and @xcite q_0 = -0.7is the deceleration parameter in which @xcite @xmath25 is the dark energy density and @xcite @xmath26 is the equation of state . thus , the order of magnitude of @xmath23 and @xmath24 inferred from cosmological observations is k_1/2 - 410 ^ -36  s^-2 .",
    "section [ quatra ] is devoted to summarizing our findings and to the conclusions .",
    "in the fermi coordinates @xmath27 associated with a fundamental observer corresponding , in this case , to the sun , the ltb tidal perturbing potential is defined according to the convention @xmath28 .",
    "that is why our @xmath29 of is @xmath30 of ( a.1 ) by @xcite with a minus sign . ]",
    "@xcite u_ltb= -arises .",
    "it induces a perturbing acceleration @xcite a_ltb =- k_1r + ( k_1-k_2)z , where @xmath31 is the unit vector along the @xmath32 axis .    in order to work out the long - term variations of the keplerian orbital elements ,",
    "it is convenient to adopt the lagrange s perturbative approach @xcite , valid for perturbations arising from a potential function , since , as we will see , it implies just one integration .",
    "in such a framework , @xmath29 has to be evaluated onto the unperturbed keplerian ellipse and averaged over one orbital period , i.e one has to compute u_ltb= _",
    "0^p_b_ltb dt , in which @xmath33 denotes the perturbing potential computed in terms of the parameters of the keplerian orbit . to this aim ,",
    "useful relations in terms of the eccentric anomaly @xmath34 are @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the semimajor axis and the eccentricity , respectively , of the unperturbed keplerian ellipse , @xmath38 is the true anomaly reckoning the position of the test particle along it , and @xmath39 is the unperturbed keplerian mean motion .",
    "the cartesian coordinates of the moving test particle along the unperturbed keplerian ellipse , explicitly entering , are @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the longitude of the ascending node , @xmath42 is the inclination of the orbit to the reference @xmath43 plane , @xmath44 is the argument of latitude , in which @xmath45 is the argument of pericentre .",
    "thus , the perturbing potential , averaged over one orbital revolution , turns out to be u_ltb= k_1(a , e , i , ) + k_2(a , e , i,),with = -,and = -.now , , with and , can be plunged into the right - hand - sides of the lagrange s equations which are @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mean anomaly . in this way , the long - term variations of the keplerian orbital elements can be straightforwardly obtained from simple derivatives . from and , with and , it immediately turns out that @xmath36 remains unchanged , on average . instead , the other keplerian orbital elements undergo long - term changes .",
    "they are where we have defined @xmath48 . while the eccentricity @xmath37 and the inclination @xmath42 experience only long - term , harmonic variations with frequency @xmath49 , the longitude of the ascending node @xmath41 , the argument of pericenter @xmath45 and the mean anomaly @xmath47 undergo secular precessions as well .",
    "much more cumbersome calculations show that the gauss perturbative approach @xcite , based on the projections of the perturbing acceleration @xmath50 of onto the radial @xmath51 , transverse @xmath52 and normal @xmath53 directions of a frame co - moving with the test particle and implying six integrals , yields the same results as - , and also @xmath54 .",
    "it turns out from - that the precession of the longitude of pericentre @xmath55 can be cast into the useful form = k_1 ( i , e,)+ k_2 ( i , e,),with , and -.from and it can be noted that both secular and long - period , harmonic terms are present . for orbits exhibiting moderate eccentricities and inclinations to the reference plane , like those of the planets of the solar system , the harmonic terms play a minor role because they appear multiplied by @xmath56 .",
    "anyway , since we do not know a - priori the magnitudes of @xmath23 and @xmath24 , we will retain all the terms of and in our calculations .",
    "concerning the results by @xcite , they used the gauss equations for the variation of the elements and the delauney orbital elements .",
    "@xcite , interested in slightly eccentric orbits , obtained non - zero secular variations of the semimajor axis @xmath36 of order @xmath57 , and of the eccentricity @xmath37 of order @xmath58 , although not explicitly shown ; actually , is of order @xmath58 , while we obtain @xmath59 to all orders in @xmath37 since it is an exact result .",
    "@xcite displayed the secular precessions of the argument of pericentre @xmath45 , to order @xmath58 , and of the longitude of the ascending node @xmath41 , to order @xmath57 . while agrees with ( a.25 ) by @xcite , is in disagreement with the sum of ( a.24 ) for @xmath45 and the additional pericentre precession due to @xmath60 by @xcite , even in the limit @xmath61 .",
    "the variation of the mean anomaly was not computed by @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to work out the variations after one orbital revolution of the radial , transverse and normal components of the perturbation of the radius vector @xmath62 . by using . ]",
    "@xcite it is possible to obtain . ]    concerning the perturbation of the velocity vector @xmath63 , its radial , transverse and normal components can be expressed , in general , as @xcite from them it is possible to obtain . ]",
    "while the transverse and normal components experience only long - term harmonic variations , the radial one exhibits a secular variation as well .",
    "recently , @xcite has analyzed more than 550000 planetary observations of several kinds covering the time interval @xmath64 .",
    "she used the dynamical force models of the epm2008 ephemerides by estimating about 260 parameters . among them , she also determined corrections @xmath2 to the standard newtonian / einsteinain perihelion precessions of all the planets of the solar system including pluto as well ; such corrections , by construction , account for any unmodelled / mismodelled dynamical effects , so that they can be used , in principle , to put constraints on @xmath23 and @xmath24 . to this aim , we will use the inner planets , whose estimated perihelion corrections are listed in table [ tavolazza ] , because they are more accurate .    .estimated corrections @xmath2 , in mas cty@xmath65 ( 1 mas cty@xmath66 s@xmath65 ) , to the standard perihelion precessions with the epm2008 ephemerides .",
    "the quoted errors are not the formal , statistical ones but are realistic . from table 8 of @xcite . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     allows to obtain more stringent constraints for @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it turns out that , in this case , venus and the earth yield the tightest ones which are @xmath67 in both cases , it turns out that @xmath68 and @xmath69 are statistically compatible with zero ; anyway , note that @xmath24 may be up to three orders magnitude larger than @xmath23",
    ".    it may be interesting to use such values for @xmath23 and @xmath24 , derived from the inner planets , with saturn in order to see if they yield a ltb perihelion precession for the ringed planet compatible with its anomalous perihelion precession @xmath70 recently estimated by processing also some years of normal points from the cassini spacecraft with both the epm and the inpop ephemerides @xcite ; see section [ cassini ] for an analysis involving a different quantity related to such interplanetary ranging data .",
    "to this aim , we have , first , to compute @xmath71 then , it turns out that < 1for all the values of @xmath72 ( - ) and the previously obtained figures for @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( - and - ) .      actually , it is possible to infer lower upper bounds by using different targets . after the cassini spacecraft started its of the saturnian system , it has been possible to drastically increase the accuracy of the orbit determination of the ringed planet through direct ranging to cassini itself .",
    "figure b-20 of @xcite shows the range residuals of saturn from 2004 to 2006 constructed with the de421 ephemerides from cassini normal points ; processing of extended data records of cassini is currently ongoing .",
    "the range residuals of figure b-20 @xcite are accurate at 10 m level . also a pair of range residuals from close encounters with voyager 1 ( 1980 ) and voyager 2 ( 1982 )",
    "are shown : they are almost one order of magnitude less accurate .",
    "thus , we will , now , look at the perturbation induced by @xmath23 and @xmath24 on the earth - saturn range @xmath73 and we will compare it to the de-421-based residuals , which are a somewhat more direct kind of observable with respect to the corrections to the perihelion precessions .",
    "figure [ rangesat ] shows the numerically computed ltb earth - saturn range perturbation for the largest values of - over a time interval of 2 yr , comparable to that of the available cassini residuals .     in the numerically integrated ( earth - moon - barycenter)-saturn ranges with and without the nominal perturbation due to the ltb cosmological tidal effects for @xmath74 s@xmath4 and @xmath75 s@xmath4 over @xmath76 yr . the same initial conditions ( j2000 )",
    "have been used for both the integrations .",
    "the state vectors at the reference epoch have been retrieved from the nasa jpl horizons system .",
    "the integrations have been performed in the icrf / j2000.0 reference frame centered at the solar system barycenter ( ssb ) . ]",
    "the amplitude of the signal is 1750 m , which is two orders of magnitude larger than the cassini residuals . even by assuming that part of the putative ltb signal , not explicitly modeled in the dynamical force models used to construct the residuals , has been absorbed and removed in the estimation of the initial conditions",
    ", it seems reasonable to conclude that a non - negligible part of a so huge anomalous effect would have been left in the residuals and , thus , it would have not escaped from detection .",
    "it can be shown that by posing @xmath77 s@xmath4 yields a ltb signal as large as 100 m over 2 yr , while for @xmath78 s@xmath4 the amplitude of the ltb range is just 10 m over 2 yr .",
    "thus , we conclude that saturn poses @xmath79 s@xmath4 as upper bounds for both @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "it is likely that when the analysis of more extended cassini data sets will be completed , more stringent limits on @xmath23 and @xmath24 will be placed .",
    "the oort cloud @xcite , populated by a huge number of small bodies moving along very eccentric orbits highly inclined to the ecliptic , is supposed to exist in the remote peripheries of the solar system . indeed , it is a spheroid with a semimajor axis of about 100 kau elongated towards the galactic center and a semiminor axis of about 80 kau @xcite .",
    "the interaction of a nearby passing star with the oort comet cloud can give rise to comet showers reaching the region of the major planets @xcite .",
    "the formation time scale of such a comet shower is about 1 myr .",
    "for example , according to @xcite , the star hip 89 825 ( gl 710 ) has a probability of 0.86 of penetrating the oort cloud in the next @xmath80 myr .",
    "moreover , its has a smaller , non - zero probability ( @xmath81 ) of falling into the region @xmath82 kau , thus potentially influencing the dynamics of the edgeworth - kuiper belt objects as well .",
    "it is interesting to see the extent to which the ltb cosmological tidal effects may alter the standard picture of the oort cloud . to this aim",
    ", we will numerically integrate over a ( keplerian ) orbital period the paths of a typical oort comet kau , @xmath83 kau , @xmath84 kau over one keplerian orbital period , so that it is well within the domain indicated by @xcite . ]",
    "( @xmath85 kau , @xmath86 kau , @xmath87 kau , @xmath88 kau myr@xmath65 , @xmath89 kau myr@xmath65 , @xmath90 kau myr@xmath65 corresponding to @xmath91 kau , @xmath92 , @xmath93 deg ) , sharing the same initial conditions , with and without the ltb tidal acceleration of .",
    "although not in a strict quantitative way as in the previous cases examined so far , such an approach may indicatively provide us with tighter constraints on @xmath23 and @xmath24 by excluding those values yielding too bizarre or implausible scenarios for the orbits of the oort comets .",
    "actually , figure [ tripla ] , depicting the sections in the coordinate planes of the purely newtonian and ltb orbits for @xmath6 s@xmath4 , and figure [ tripla_due ] , showing the heliocentric distances and velocities of the same paths , tell us that the values for the ltb parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 allowed by the earth - saturn range are likely still too large .",
    "indeed , the resulting numerically integrated paths are radically different from the newtonian ones .",
    "it must also be noted that the ltb acceleration ( @xmath94 m s@xmath4 ) is larger than the newtonian one ( @xmath95 m s@xmath4 ) , so that the perturbative scheme would not be applicable : the numerical integration of the equations of motion including both the ltb and the newtonian accelerations is , thus , strictly required .",
    "the consequences on the dynamics of the oort cloud and on the comet showers may be not negligible , although , of course , not easily predictable .",
    "suffices it to note from figure [ tripla_due ] the globally smaller spatial extension of the ltb orbit and its higher velocity which might reduce the impact of nearby passing stars .",
    "further numerical analyses show that reasonable orbits , i.e. not too far from the newtonian picture , occur for @xmath96 s@xmath4 , when @xmath97 .",
    "it must be stressed that it turns out that , actually , the ltb trajectories exhibit a strong dependence on the initial conditions .",
    "thus , a complete statistical analysis involving vast ensembles of different initial conditions would be required , but it is outside the scope of the present work .",
    "we , first , analytically worked out the long - term , i.e. averaged over one orbital revolution , perturbations on the orbit of a test particle moving in a local fermi frame induced by the cosmological tidal effects of the inhomogeneous lematre - tolman - bondi model which has recently attracted attention as possible explanation of the observed cosmic acceleration without resorting to dark energy .",
    "in particular , we computed the variations of the semimajor axis @xmath36 , the eccentricity @xmath37 , the inclination @xmath42 , the longitude of the ascending node @xmath41 , the argumet of pericenter @xmath45 and the mean anomaly @xmath47 by means of the lagrange s variational equations with the eccentric anomaly @xmath34 as fast variable .",
    "we found that @xmath36 does not experience any change , on average , while the other keplerian orbital elements undergo long - term variations including both secular and harmonic terms with frequency @xmath49 ; @xmath37 and @xmath42 exhibit only sinusoidal changes , while @xmath98 secularly precess as well .",
    "we repeated the calculation also with the gauss perturbative approach by finding the same results .",
    "we also explicitly computed the changes over one orbital revolution of the position and velocity vectors along the radial @xmath99 , transverse @xmath100 and normal directions @xmath101 of a frame co - moving with the test particle .",
    "while the radial and normal components @xmath102 and @xmath103 of the perturbation of the position vector experience only harmonic variations , the transverse one @xmath104 shows secular changes as well . concerning the velocity",
    ", its radial perturbation @xmath105 undergoes both secular and sinusoidal modifications , while its transverse and normal components @xmath106 and @xmath107 exhibit harmonic signatures only . in obtaining our results we made no approximations on @xmath37 and @xmath42 by retaining all terms .",
    "then , we phenomenologically put constraints on both the parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the ltb metric in the local fermi frame by looking at various astronomical bodies and data of the solar system . by comparing our analytical prediction for the rate of the longitude of pericenter @xmath108 to different sets of the corrections @xmath2 to the standard newtonian / einsteinian precessions of the perihelia of the inner planets recently estimated with the epm ephemerides we found that the tightest constraints are @xmath3 s@xmath4 , @xmath5 s@xmath4",
    "the confrontation of the residuals of the earth - saturn range , obtained by processing some years of radiotechnical data from the cassini spacecraft as well , with the numerically computed ltb - induced earth - saturn range signal allowed to set @xmath6 s@xmath4 . by looking at the ltb - type distortions of the orbit of a typical object of the oort cloud with respect to the commonly accepted newtonian picture , based on the observations of the comet showers from that remote region of the solar system , pointed towards even lower bounds , i.e. @xmath7 s@xmath4 . according to cosmological data , @xmath8 s@xmath4 .",
