    "a supernova ( sn or sne , from the plural _ supernovae _ ) is a stellar explosion which may occur at the final stage of the evolution of a star or as the result of the interaction between stars in a binary system .",
    "the current supernova classification follows the historical order in which these events were observed .",
    "initially , the explosions were divided into types i and ii , according to the presence ( type ii ) or absence ( type i ) of hydrogen emission lines in their spectra .",
    "later , the observation of sne with different spectral features resulted in the introduction of the subtypes which we use nowadays ( see figure [ fig : sn_classification ] ) .",
    "sne of types ii , ib and ic are now believed to occur due to gravitational collapse of massive stars ( above @xmath0 solar masses ) , which leave behind a neutron star or a black hole .",
    "type ia sne , on the other hand , are believed to be thermonuclear explosions in which the star is completely incinerated .",
    "it is currently accepted that sn ia are thermonuclear explosions @xcite of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs that reach explosion conditions when , by accreting mass from a companion , approach the chandrasekhar limiting mass ( @xmath1 1.4 solar masses).@xcite in the single degenerate scenario , the companion is generally considered to be a main sequence , a red giant or an agb star , whereas in the double degenerate scenario it is another white dwarf .",
    "the nitty - grity details of the explosion process and the progenitor channel are still open to debate , both theoretically and observationally.@xcite    as already stated , sne are classified according to the presence or absence of certain spectral lines in their spectra and , for sne ii subtypes , the shape of their light curves .",
    "type i sne can be divided into three subtypes : sne ia present a silicon absorption feature around wavelength @xmath2  ( their main characteristic ) ; sne ib does not present silicon lines but present helium absorption lines ; and sne ic present neither silicon nor helium features . to learn more about the spectral features of sne , see @xcite .",
    "the most interesting subtype for cosmological purposes is the ia , because of their high power , which allows us to detect them in distant galaxies , and their quite homogeneous emission , which makes possible their use as standard candles .    a given class of astrophysical objects ( or events )",
    "is considered a standard candle when their intrinsic luminosity is known or can somehow be estimated . in the case of sne ia , the observation of nearby events showed that all explosions had quite similar luminosities and the relatively small variations ( as compared to the typical magnitudes of sne ia ) can be corrected for ( in fact , due to the existence of such fluctuations these events should actually be considered _",
    "standardizable _ candles ) .",
    "sne ia themselves can be divided into subgroups and a classification scheme much used in the literature is the one by branch _ et al._,@xcite according to which these events can be 1991bg - like aa .. az , ba .. bz , etc ; e.g. ,  sn 1997bs \" . ] , which are subluminous , 1991t - like , which are superluminous , and normal ( _ branch - normal _ ) . to have concrete numbers to express those variations , we calculated the sample standard deviation in absolute magnitudes @xmath3 ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : fundamental_quantities ] ) of the sne ia in a sample of vaughan _",
    "et al._,@xcite comprising 50 sne ia , of which 25 are branch - normal . considering only the branch - normal sne ia ,",
    "the standard deviation of the distribution of @xmath3 is 0.65 mag , while its mean is @xmath4 mag    . for a more recent data sample ,",
    "see @xcite since the flux of a source measured on earth is proportional to the source s luminosity and inversely proportional to its distance squared ( more precisely , to its luminosity distance squared , which we will define later ) , we see that it is possible to estimate the sne ia distance by measuring its flux .",
    "it was using sne ia that the winners of the 2011 physics nobel prize discovered in 1998 and 1999 that the universe is currently on an accelerated expansion.@xcite currently , we believe that the cosmic acceleration is caused , in the context of general relativity , by an unknown form of energy , called dark energy , which would generate a gravitational repulsion unlike radiation , baryonic and cold dark matter , for which the gravitational interaction is attractive . the most popular candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant , which is usually interpreted as vacuum energy .",
    "there are , nevertheless , other explanations for the accelerated expansion being investigated , based either on modifications of general relativity , or on the existence of inhomogeneities in the matter distribution of the universe.@xcite    as already mentioned , sne ia are standardizable candles which can be observed in very distant galaxies due to their high power .",
    "they are , however , rare events , the rate of occurrence of sne ia per volume is @xmath5 , according to @xcite . ] and , since being explosions , they are transients ( lasting around three months ) , which makes their observation a difficult task . in order to detect a high number of sne ,",
    "various projects are being planned , as this will demand a greater number of researchers in the field . for a list of these projects and",
    "some of the most important past and present experiments , see table [ tab : snexp ] .",
    "our goal in this work is to highlight some basic concepts concerning the use of sne ia for cosmology , which we found are not detailed in textbooks .",
    "we believe that this work will be of great utility for those who are starting their research in the field , as well as for researchers who have never worked specifically in this field",

    "uses a spectrograph to decompose the incoming light into its different wavelength components and obtain a measure of the specific flux at a given time , i.e. the spectrum of the object .",
    "despite the high spectral resolving power in wavelength ( @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the resolution of the spectrograph ) provided by spectroscopy ( a low to intermediate resolution spectrograph has @xmath19 of the order 100010000 , whereas state of the art high resolution ones can achieve @xmath20 ) , it demands more observation time per object and more expensive equipment . in figure",

    "band maximum light.@xcite here and in all forthcoming figures showing spectra , geometric symbols ( circles , squares , and triangles ) serve only as a guide for the reader to better identify to which sn each curve refers . ]    in photometry one uses filters , which let the light pass only for a particular wavelength interval ( the filter bandpass ) , and the resulting observation , called flux , corresponds to specific flux integrated over this interval .",
    "flux measures in a given filter at different times ( or epochs ) constitute a usual ( not specific ) light curve of the object .",
    "photometry is a cheaper and faster technique and there are many projects being designed to get a huge amount of data through photometric observations .",
    "we now show how to obtain sn ia light curve templates at a given filter from a theoretical model for @xmath21 . these templates are necessary for the standardization of sn ia light curves , as will be discussed in section [ sec : lc_standardization ] .",
    "first we have to take into account the bandpass of the chosen filter .",
    "the filters _ ubvri _",

    "the reader can find a detailed discussion on photometric systems in bessell.@xcite we show in figure [ fig : filters ] the transmissivity curves , i.e. the fraction of energy that passes through the filter as a function of wavelength , @xmath22 , for these filters .",
    "it is important to notice that the filters are not perfect , in the sense that they do not let all photons pass , no matter what wavelength we consider .",
    "we will define the flux in band @xmath23 , @xmath24 , as the energy flux that is transmitted through filter @xmath23 , which can be written as @xmath25 where we have , for brevity of notation , suppressed the dependence of @xmath26 ( and thereby of @xmath24 ) on @xmath27 .",

    "our photometric system will be defined by the filter set _",

    "since we chose to perform our calculations in wavelength space , we need to rewrite the _ ab _ reference specific flux using the relation @xmath34 recalling that @xmath35 , we can obtain the reference specific flux as a function of wavelength @xmath36    therefore , to build a light curve , we need to evaluate the magnitudes for a given filter using ( [ mx ] ) for spectra at different epochs . in figure  [ fig : typical_light_curves ] , we show some light curves from typical sne ia , whereas in figure [ fig : template ] we show a sn ia light curve obtained from the sn ia template generated by nugent.@xcite     band light curves from two branch - normal ( sn2004ef and sn2006d ) and one 1991t - like ( sn2005 m ) sne ia.@xcite notice that a simple visual inspection of the light curves does not allow determining the subtypes . ]    with given source and detector , we can display the visual representation of the function @xmath37 by means of what we will call the spectral surface . in figure",

    "the spectrum of the source , at a given time @xmath39 , is the intersection of the spectral surface with the plane @xmath40 , and the specific light curve , at a given wavelength @xmath41 , is the intersection of the spectral surface with the plane @xmath42 . a spectral surface like",
    "the one shown in figure [ fig : sedsurface ] would be the result of ideal observations of a sn , continuous both in wavelength and time . in practice",
    "the best we can do is a discrete sampling of that surface for a given sn ; however , even this would be unfeasible for a high number of sne , because of the time demanded for the observations and the need for high cost facilities .",
    "it is convenient to find a relationship between ideal detected quantities and intrinsic ( source rest - frame ) ones in a cosmological spacetime . to that end , as a motivating warm - up , let us consider an imaginary spherical ( 2-dimensional ) surface , of radius @xmath19 , concentric with a light source , both at rest in an inertial frame of the minkowski spacetime .",
    "the bolometric ( raw or pure ) flux is defined as @xmath43 and , due to conservation of energy , is trivially related to the intrinsic bolometric luminosity @xmath44/s . ] by : @xmath45    we now introduce the concept of the redshift @xmath14 , which is a measure of the relative velocity between astrophysical objects through the observation of their spectral features @xcite :    @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the wavelength of a spectral feature , as measured in its rest frame , and @xmath48 is the corresponding wavelength measured on earth .    in [ sec : basic_equation ] we show an intuitive way to obtain the relation between flux and luminosity for a more general spacetime , taking @xmath14 into account , which is ( [ specific_flux ] )    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the specific luminosity in the source s rest - frame .    from specific flux measures in different wavelengths ( or frequencies ) , in a given epoch",
    ", we can construct a spectrum of an astrophysical object . in figure",

    "is _ blueshifted _ , and the other part comes from regions that are moving away from us , being therefore redshifted . since different layers of the expanding gas move with different velocities , the resulting spectrum presents wide emission lines centered at the rest wavelenghth value . as an example of such lines , we can see two siii absorption lines with rest - frame wavelengths @xmath51  and @xmath52  which appear in the spectrum in figure [ fig : d ] as a broad absorption feature at @xmath53  ( indicated by the dashed vertical line ) followed by an emission line centered at @xmath54  .",
    "based on the definition of apparent magnitude in a given filter , given by ( [ mx ] ) , we can introduce the concept of absolute magnitude , the apparent magnitude that the source would have for a hypothetical observer at a distance of @xmath55 parsecs light - years or @xmath56 m. 1 parsec is the distance to an object with rest - frame size of 1 astronomical unit and apparent angular size of 1 arc second . ] and at rest with respect to it ( @xmath57 ) ,    @xmath58    we would like to call the reader s attention to the fact that , by its very definition , it makes no sense to refer to an absolute magnitude for @xmath59 , something that is not always explicit in the literature .",
    "we can also consider an ideal case , in which we could measure the flux of a source in all wavelengths with a perfect detector ( @xmath60 ) , to define bolometric magnitudes , @xmath61 @xmath62    the distance to an astronomical object is directly related to its bolometric magnitudes through the quantity called _ distance modulus _ : @xmath63    as we will discuss in section [ sec : dependence ] , the observed spectrum of a source is modified with respect to its intrinsic one by the redshift , and therefore the radiation emitted in a given wavelength range in the source s rest frame will be observed in a different range in the observer s frame .",
    "also , since we simply can not measure bolometric magnitudes , but only magnitudes in some filters , it is useful to express the distance modulus in terms of filter magnitudes , which requires the introduction of the so called @xmath64-correction @xmath65 defined as @xmath66    a full discussion of @xmath64-corrections and their applications for cosmology are left by the authors to another paper .",
    "it is important to note that even for a class of objects with the same intrinsic luminosity , which is approximately the case of sne ia ( apart from the variations mentioned in section [ sec : introduction ] ) , their observed fluxes ( both specific and bolometric ) will differ mainly due to the different redshifts and distances .",
    "from ( [ specific_flux ] ) we can see that , at a given time @xmath13 and at a given wavelength @xmath10 , the specific flux can vary with distance @xmath11 to the source , with redshift @xmath14 , and with the functional form of the specific luminosity @xmath67 .",
    "considering sne ia as standard candles means that we will assume all events to have the same specific luminosity .",
    "we know , however , that there are variations in their luminosities that should be taken into account and this will be considered in section [ sec : lc_standardization ] . in the present section",
    "we will study how an arbitrary observed spectrum differs from the source s rest - frame spectrum , as we change , independently , the distance @xmath11 and the redshift @xmath14 . to that end",
    ", we advise the reader to refer now to [ sec : basic_transformations ] , where we graphically remind what happens to a function which is subjected to certain simple transformations that will be relevant in the next subsections .",
    "let us analyze first the simpler effect , the one arising from distance changes only . from ( [ specific_flux ] ) , we can see the dependence of the specific flux on the inverse square of the distance @xmath11 .",
    "thus , when @xmath68 all other independent variables held constant , we have that @xmath69 therefore , in a graph of the spectrum , as shown in figure [ fig : distance ] for sn1994d , we employ , in a linear scale ( left panel ) , the vertical distortion of ( [ vert_dist ] ) and , in a logarithmic scale ( right panel ) , the vertical translation of ( [ vert_trans ] ) .",
    "the effect on the spectrum of a pure change only in distance is manifest in the logarithmic scale , where the rigid vertical translation is obvious .",
    "let us analyze now the effect of the redshift , related to the relative motion between source and observer .",
    "again , from ( [ specific_flux ] ) , we can see the dependence of the specific flux on the inverse cube of @xmath70 and also modifying explicitly the independent variables @xmath10 , and @xmath13 by factors of @xmath71 .",
    "thus , when @xmath72 all other independent variables held constant , we have that @xmath73 of course , referring to the appendix , we see that this transformation of the specific flux involves the composition of a vertical distortion , ( [ vert_dist ] ) , and a horizontal distortion , ( [ hor_dist ] ) . to get a handle on it",
    "more intuitively , let us choose @xmath57 so that the former equation will provide the redshifted spectrum from the rest - frame one : @xmath74 or vice versa , the rest - frame spectrum from the redshifted one : @xmath75 now , to illustrate this redshifting effect in a most pristine situation , we apply ( [ rest_frame2redshifted_spectrum ] ) to a top - hat function . the result is shown in figure  [ fig : redshift ] .    in the left panel ,",
    "we show that the total qualitative effect of the redshift is : ( i ) a vertical squeezing , due to the @xmath76 pre - factor , and ( ii ) a horizontal stretch caused by the rescaling @xmath77 in the first argument of @xmath16 . from this panel ,",
    "the reader could naively be induced to regard the displacement towards greater wavelengths as a third , independent , effect ; however , as can be seen from the right panel of figure  [ fig : redshift ] , such a displacement is in fact also due to the horizontal stretch , which leaves the vertical @xmath78-axis ( @xmath79 ) fixed ( cf .",
    "( [ hor_dist ] ) and right lower panel of figure  [ fig : basic_function_transformations ] ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : d ] , left panel , we showed observed spectra of three sne ia . in its right panel , we now show the corresponding rest - frame ( @xmath57 ) spectra .",
    "we can notice the small horizontal displacement of the spectral lines ( blueshifted , towards the left ) but it is not possible to visualize the vertical displacement ( upwards ) due to the low values of the redshift involved .",
    "we can also see that , even after the redshift correction , the spectra do not coincide and this is because each sn is at a different distance from us .    to explicitly reveal the redshifting effect on the spectrum of a concrete sn ia , we show , in figure  [ fig : z ] , three spectra of sn 1994d , the rest - frame one and two other ( artificial ) high redshift ones ( left panel ) . in particular , the effect of the pre - factor @xmath76 in ( [ rest_frame2redshifted_spectrum ] ) can be best viewed using a logarithmic scale ( right panel ) , in which it becomes a simple vertical translation ( cf .",
    "( [ vert_trans ] ) and left upper panel of figure  [ fig : basic_function_transformations ] ) .",
    "although source - frame sne ia light curves are very similar , they are not identical . in this section",
    "we will show that it is possible to make them even more similar by applying some simple operations , which are dubbed standardization , and we will apply this procedure to a sample of real type ia sne .",
    "the process of standardization became possible after the discovery that intrinsically brighter sne ( at @xmath31 band maximum ) were also the ones with wider light curves.@xcite such a correlation rendered it possible to determine if a given sn was brighter ( fainter ) than another one either because it was closer ( further ) or because it was intrinsically brighter ( dimmer ) , just by looking at their light curves .",
    "the data used in this work are publically available,@xcite and constitute the sample of 85 low redshift sne ia observed by the carnegie supernova project ( csp).@xcite motivated by the higher uniformity of sne ia in the infra - red band , one of the main goals of that project was to obtain particularly well sampled and well characterized light curves both in optical and near - infrared bands , which should improve the efficiency of the standardization process .",
    "we restricted ourselves to the subsample of only branch - normal sne ia , which reduced the number of events to 71 .",
    "the corrections that we will present here were originally done simultaneously through a single fit that yields all the correction factors for each sn ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) ; however we chose to implement them step by step in order to make clear the role of each one in the final result .",

    "two of them can be easily taken account of : distance and redshift .",
    "the latter entails a change of the time scale and an offset to the magnitude ( or change of the flux normalization ) whereas the former implies a simple offset to the magnitude .",
    "thus the correction for both effects amounts to :    1 .   a ( horizontal ) dilation , cf . ( [ hor_dist ] ) , of the time axis such that @xmath83 where @xmath84 is a time interval in the observer s frame and @xmath85 is the corresponding interval in the source s rest frame .",
    "2 .   a ( vertical ) rigid translation , cf . ( [ vert_trans ] ) , of the magnitude axis .",
    "notice that after the rigid vertical translations to correct for the redshift and distance , it is possible that the peaks of the light curves still do not coincide , since there can be absolute magnitude differences among them .",
    "so , in order to make the peaks coincide , a third vertical rigid translation is still needed . in our case , we do not know the distances to the sne in our sample , so what we actually did was to evaluate the peak magnitude s mean , and displace the light curves in order to make their magnitudes match this mean",
    ". this operation accounts for the rigid vertical translations due to both the redshift and the distance corrections , and also to a third rigid translation to correct for other differences in absolute magnitude .",
    "the resulting distance- and redshift - corrected light curves of our subsample are shown in figure  [ y ] . in order to display all sne in their rest frame time , notice that we have chosen to change the @xmath86-axis from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "because of this , a little bit of care must be taken when comparing figure  [ y ] and the following figures in this section to the results presented in section  [ sec : dependence ] and [ sec : basic_transformations ] , where we are keeping the @xmath86-axis unchanged before and after a given transformation .",
    "the stretch parameter @xmath81 is related to the width of the light curve , i.e. it measures how fast the supernova s flux decreases ( or its magnitude increases).@xcite in order to calculate the stretch , we need to adopt a fiducial curve which , in our case , was chosen to be simply the mean of all curves in the sample , and assign the value @xmath89 to it . a curve that declines slower ( faster ) than the fiducial one will have @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "after the corrections described in subsections [ subsec : timeaxiscorr ] and [ subsec : distance_redshift_corrections ] all curves coincide at the @xmath31 band maximum but not necessarily at any other point .",
    "the stretch correction is designed so that the curves also coincide at 15 source frame days after @xmath31 band maximum .",
    "we show a sketch of this procedure in figure [ cstretch ] , in which we use a fiducial ( red curve ) and two ficticious light curves , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , in blue .",
    "to obtain the stretch we need to solve for @xmath94 from the following equation @xmath95 where @xmath96 is an interpolating function ( in our case a spline ) for the @xmath97-th sn ia @xmath31 band light curve , and @xmath98 is the value of @xmath31 ( + offset ) of the mean light curve at @xmath99 days .",
    "thus , the stretch can be written as @xmath100    we can then divide all phases of a supernova by the obtained stretch so the curves coincide at phase 15 days .    as mentioned earlier , the width difference in the light curves",
    "is associated to their intrinsic brightness ( broader @xmath101 brighter ) . when we correct for the stretch we are compensating the differences in intrinsic brightness between the supernovae .",
    "the result of the application of the stretch procedure to our sample can be seen in figure [ s ] .",

    "we can see that the results obtained with our step - by - step method agree quite well with the ones obtained with this more sophisticated fitting recipe .",
    "after we apply all the corrections discussed above we can construct what we can call a  rudimentary \" template , a simple mean of all corrected curves , that can be compared to the nugent template , one of the most used in the literature.@xcite we show the comparison in figure [ template ] . in this comparison",

    "arbitrary_. we can , on the other hand , compare the absolute difference shown in figure [ template ] ( lower panel ) to the range of the nugent template in the depicted interval ( @xmath104 $ ] ) , for instance , which is @xmath105 , and the discrepancy thus calculated is always less than @xmath106 .",
    "we can see that , despite the simplified analysis performed here , our curve looks quite similar to the template , which shows the consistency between our template and the nugent one .",
    "we show in figure [ sigma ] the standard deviation of our sample before and after the stretch correction .",
    "again , we can not use relative discrepancies in the whole time interval to compare these curves because both the standard deviations are zero at @xmath107 by construction ( see subsection [ subsec : distance_redshift_corrections ] ) and the stretch corrected one is also null at @xmath108=15 $ ] .",
    "nevertheless , the overall decreasing in the dispersion after the maximum is clear from figure [ sigma ] . since such gain",
    "is obtained through a simple linear transformation , with only one parameter , we can argue that it reflects the homogeneity of the light curves in our sample    the reader might note that the discrepancy between the standard deviation after the stretch correction ( in figure [ sigma ] ) is greater before maximum .",
    "this feature reflects the fact that the dispersion of the sne ia is smaller before the maximum ( see hayden _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite ) .",
    "the stretch is defined to decrease the dispersion after maximum but it is applied to the whole light curve through ( [ hor_dist ] ) therefore , since the curves are more uniform before the maximum , when we multiply their arguments by different numbers the net result is an increasing of the dispersion in this interval .",
    "this article had two main aims : ( i ) presenting and clarifying some fundamental concepts and results related to the cosmological use of sne ia , and ( ii ) building a simple sn ia light curve template .",
    "the first aim led us to introduce , in section  [ sec : fundamental_quantities ] , the specific flux or spectral energy distribution as the principal quantity characterizing the class of transient sne ia , and the corresponding projections ( spectra and specific light curves ) . in section  [ sec : dependence ] , we studied in particular its dependence on distance and redshift and the consequent impact on the observed fluxes or magnitudes .    to comply with the second aim cited above , in section  [ sec : lc_standardization ]",
    ", we built our naive light curve template , for didactic purposes , through a simplified version of the original stretch procedure : we performed the determination of the three parameters of the method ( the overall normalization of the light curve , the epoch of maximum flux in @xmath31 band and the stretch itself ) separately , instead of the simultaneous fit described in goldhaber _",
    "et al._.@xcite we finally constructed a mean light curve after the application of the method and compared it to a light curve template much used in the literature,@xcite showing that our simplified method is able to produce a template very similar to it .",
    "in fact , the discrepancy is less than @xmath109 for most of the phases in the interval of @xmath110 $ ] days in the light curve ( see figure [ template ] ) . from this very simple exercise",
    "we can infer how uniform the population of branch - normal sne ia really is , since it is possible to decrease considerably the rest - frame magnitude standard deviation ( after the maximum flux ) of the light curves in our sample using just the single stretch parameter ( cf .",
    "figure [ sigma ] ) .",
    "it is worth noting that after the discovery of the correlation between sn ia luminosities and the width of their light curves , other secondary empirical correlations were also discovered , such as the one between a sn ia luminosity and its color @xcite ( the brightest sne ia are also the bluest ones ) .",
    "the process of standardization nowadays is , therefore , done through computational codes such as salt2 @xcite and mlcs2k2,@xcite which take into account all these correlations .",
    "our current analysis does not yet address the relationship between the stretch parameter and the actual absolute value of the peak luminosity of sne ia , which is a necessary step for their use as extragalactic distance indicators .",
    "we leave this step for a future paper , which will take into account the cosmological applications of what has been presented here .",
    "in this appendix we investigate four simple transformations ( of one real parameter @xmath111 on an arbitrary function @xmath112 which bear upon the changes on the specific flux due to distance and redshift ( cf . section  [ sec : dependence ] ) .",
    "these are ( cf . figure  [ fig : basic_function_transformations ] ) :    1 .",

    "finally , we state that an equation of this same form holds for an arbitrary motion ( not in the hubble flow ) of the source and the detector , viz .",
