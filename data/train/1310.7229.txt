    "it appears that non - gaussianity of a quantum state is a useful feature in quantum information processing , regardless of being non - classical or classical according to the concepts of quantum optics . to quantify this property as a resource",

    "@xcite , genoni _ et al .",
    "_ used the hilbert - schmidt metric and the relative entropy as distances and gave a comprehensive discussion of the general properties of non - gaussianity degrees for large sets of one - mode , two - mode , and multimode states .",

    "@xcite a degree of non - gaussianity based on the bures metric was similarly introduced .",
    "we stress now that all the distance - type measures considered so far used the same state @xmath4 as a reference gaussian state in evaluating non - gaussianity .",
    "it was only very recently that two of us succeeded to prove that the relative entropy of _ any _ @xmath5-mode state to its associate gaussian one @xmath4 is an _",
    "exact _ distance - type measure of non - gaussianity @xcite .",
    "all these measures were already employed to evaluate non - gaussianity degrees in some interesting experiments . in the experiment reported in ref .",
    "@xcite the relative - entropy measure was used for single - photon - added coherent states , while in ref . @xcite the same degree",
    "was evaluated in an experiment with multiple - photon subtraction from a thermal state .",
    "the three above - mentioned degrees of non - gaussianity were determined and compared in some recent experiments on phase - averaged coherent states @xcite .",
    "the present work parallels some of our recent findings on the non - gaussianity and its decay in contact with a thermal reservoir for an interesting class of fock - diagonal one - mode states : the photon - added thermal states @xcite . here",

    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall some statistical properties of a psts . in section 3",
    "the three usual degrees of non - gaussianity for a fock - diagonal one - mode state are recapitulated",

    "we finally compare the decay of non - gaussianity for pairs of states , pstss and patss , having the same thermal mean occupancy @xmath6 , as well as the same number @xmath0 of subtracted and , respectively , added photons .",
    "our concluding remarks are presented in section 5 .",
    "it is known that excitations on a gaussian state @xmath7 of the type @xmath8 lead to non - gaussian states @xcite . here",

    "@xcite we have recently studied the non - gaussianity of @xmath0-photon - added thermal states and investigated their behaviour under damping .",
    "their non - classicality was marked by the negativity of both wigner and @xmath1 functions surviving to some extent under damping as well .",

    "we have shown that decaying of non - gaussianity was consistently pointed out by three distance - type measures .",

    "we conclude by stressing the significance of the agreement between the three measures of non - gaussianity employed here , which is equally valid for both the patss and the pstss . because the entropic measure @xmath50 $ ] is an exact one @xcite , the other two , @xmath51 $ ] and @xmath52 $ ] , albeit approximate , are nevertheless reliable .",
