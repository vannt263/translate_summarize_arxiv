    "upper limits on the flux from cyg x-1 at photon energies @xmath0 mev and a detection of 0.110 gev emission in the hard spectral state of cyg x-1 have recently been reported using the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( lat ; @xcite , hereafter mzc13 ) .",
    "although the detection has a limited statistical significance , it has been confirmed by the independent work of @xcite , who found variable emission using the lat data in the hard and intermediate states , but not in the soft state .",
    "the spectra and upper limits of mzc13 complement the previously known radio  to  hard x - ray spectra of cyg x-1 in the hard state , e.g. , the average one compiled in @xcite and shown in fig .",
    "[ spectra ] .",
    "we apply to these data the jet model developed in @xcite , hereafter paper i.    we take into account , in particular , the possibility that the mev tail in the hard state of the source is due to the jet synchrotron emission , as implied by the recent claims of very strong linear polarization in that energy range @xcite .",
    "we find that the combination of a high flux around mev energies ( if interpreted as synchrotron radiation ) and a low flux above 30 mev requires rather strong jet magnetic field ( much above the equipartition level ) , necessary to reduce the strength of compton scattering in high - energy @xmath1-rays .",
    "we note that the statistical significance of the result of @xcite appears rather low , since the distribution of the azimuthal scattering angle presented in their fig .",
    "2 is independent only up to @xmath2 .",
    "there is also a disagreement regarding the polarization in the 250400 kev band , which was found weak and consistent with null by @xcite , whereas @xcite found it to be @xmath3 per cent .",
    "in addition , @xcite found the polarization above 400 kev to be @xmath4 per cent compared to the best fit at @xmath5 per cent in the 370850 kev band found by ( * ? ? ? * see figure  4 therein ) .",
    "the agreement of the polarized fraction with @xcite at @xmath6 per cent claimed by @xcite was obtained only by adding the two channels within the 230850 kev range .",
    "the results regarding the 230370 kev band are thus quantitatively different between the two papers .",
    "this could be , in principle , due to the somewhat different observation periods on which the two works are based , 20032009 for @xcite vs.  20062009 for @xcite .",
    "then , in the 370850 kev band of @xcite , the minimum @xmath7 appears to be obtained at the polarization fraction of @xmath8 per cent .",
    "if we compare the @xmath7 not at this unphysical value but at @xmath9 per cent polarization ( consistent with the stated fractions of @xcite and @xcite ) with the @xmath7 at null polarization , the resulting @xmath10 is @xmath11 for 41500 degrees of freedom .",
    "thus , the statistical significance of the presence of strong polarization at that channel appears weak .",
    "therefore , we also consider models in which the jet does not account for the mev tail .    in section [ method ] , we outline the method applied to model the data , and specify the adopted parameters of cyg x-1 .",
    "we extend the model presented in paper i for an analytical treatment of the particle evolution beyond the energy dissipation region ( see appendix [ advection ] ) .",

    "we use the same parameters of cyg x-1 and its jet as those adopted by mzc13 , which we list in table [ cygx1 ] ( note that the last four parameters are not independent ) .",

    "different than @xcite , @xcite took into account that cyg x-1 is still in the stable , core h - burning , phase , as evidenced by the observed stability of the period , @xmath17 , and of the average x - ray luminosity ( see discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this implies a tight correlation between the mass and the luminosity , which is violated by the best fit of @xcite . taking it into account",

    "the distance , @xmath25 , is from @xcite , the jet velocity , @xmath26 ( assumed to be constant along the jet ) , is based on @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , and the opening angle , @xmath27 , is the upper limit of @xcite .",
    "these parameters correspond to the stellar luminosity , @xmath28 , the separation between the components , @xmath29 , the jet bulk lorentz factor , @xmath30 , and the gravitational radius , @xmath31 , as given in table [ cygx1 ] .",
    "we assume the jet is perpendicular to the binary plane .",
    "the radio structure seen by very large array ( vla ) and very long baseline array ( vlba ) at 8.4 ghz extends up to @xmath32 cm @xcite .",
    "we assume this value as the jet height , which corresponds to @xmath33 , and which also approximately equals the height of the dissipation region in the internal shock model for the hard state of black - hole binaries of @xcite .",
    "the entire emitting jet becomes optically thin above the turnover energy , @xmath34 .",
    "the adopted value of @xmath34 ( table [ cygx1 ] ) is based on the results of @xcite .",
    "the flux in the partially self - absorbed region is normalized to the average hard - state flux at 15 ghz ( table [ cygx1 ] ) .",
    "[ spectra ] includes the same average hard - state broad - band spectrum of cyg x-1 as that of @xcite except that we now show also the average fluxes at 235 mhz and 610 mhz based on @xcite .",
    "given that one of their 610-mhz measurements has an error much smaller than all other ones , the weighted average is strongly dominated by that single measurement even if we include two non - detections ( on mjd 53104 , 53127 ) as null fluxes with the errors equal to the upper limits .",
    "therefore , we give the unweighted averages of the detections only ( mjd 52891 , 53102 , 53107 ) , yielding @xmath35 mjy and @xmath36 mjy , at 235 mhz and 610 mhz respectively .",
    "theoretical spectra of the jet emission are calculated using the model developed in paper i. we take into account all relevant radiative processes .",
    "these are synchrotron radiation , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) , and compton upscattering of stellar blackbody photons ( bbc ) and of the accretion flow photons ( xc ) .",
    "the accretion flow photons are described with a disc and hot inner flow model ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the accretion disc is assumed to extend between @xmath37 cm and @xmath38 cm ( the exact values of which influence only little our results ) , and to have the maximum temperature of @xmath39 ev with the colour correction of @xmath40 , based on @xcite .",
    "this disc soft x - ray spectrum agrees well with the observed spectrum of @xcite , which is typical for the hard state . at high energies",

    "its total luminosity is @xmath41 erg s@xmath19 .",

    "the height along the jet is expressed in units of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath42 marks the onset of the energy dissipation within the outflow .",
    "the magnetic field strength is @xmath44 , and the jet is assumed to be conical with the opening angle of @xmath27 .",
    "the minimum electron lorentz factor , @xmath1 , down to which we calculate the steady - state distribution , is assumed to be @xmath45 .",
    "the electrons are accelerated in the dissipation region , @xmath46 , and injected with a power - law rate above a minimum lorentz factor of @xmath47 , @xmath48 where @xmath49 describes the high - energy cutoff ( see paper i ) . given theoretical uncertainties in the determination of the exact spectral shape of a cut - off in the injection particle distribution @xmath50 , instead of specifying the @xmath51 function , below we simply assume the super - exponential form of the high - energy cut - off in the corresponding steady - state electron distribution @xmath52 , namely @xmath53 , \\label{fcut}\\ ] ] where @xmath54 is given by equations ( 6 ) and ( 5 ) of paper i. with the adopted @xmath55-function approximation in the synchrotron emissivity , @xmath56 , the cutoff in the model synchrotron spectra is then exponential , @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the corresponding photon e - folding energy .",
    "paper i presented two methods of calculating @xmath59 . in the simpler method , the electron distribution is solved locally including the effect of self - absorption , and electron advection along the jet is neglected , this yields a relatively simple formula for @xmath59 , @xmath60 the effect of the synchrotron self - absorption , which makes @xmath61 itself dependent on @xmath59 , can be taken into account using the approximation of equation ( 12 ) of paper i. the equation for @xmath62 becomes then a quadratic one , see equation ( 46 ) of paper i.    in the other method , electron advection along the jet is taken into account via the continuity equation solved in both electron energy and length along the jet , @xmath63+{\\partial\\over \\partial \\gamma}\\left[\\dot \\gamma(\\gamma , z ) n(\\gamma , z)\\right]=q(\\gamma ,",
    "z ) ,    \\label{ndot}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 is the total electron energy loss rate .",
    "if klein - nishina ( kn ) effects ( important in cyg x-1 ) are taken into account , this transport equation has to be solved numerically .",
    "also , in such a case there is no simple way to account for self - absorption effects . given that calculating compton - scattered spectra averaged over the binary phase and jet length involves additional multi - dimensional integrals ( see paper i ) , using a numerical solution for @xmath59 increases substantially the complexity of the calculations and the computation time .",
    "however , it has been shown in paper i that the two solutions are very close to each other for the particular form of @xmath65 assumed here ( equation [ q_inj ] ) , i.e. , for constant monochromatic power injected per @xmath66 .",
    "for adiabatic losses only , the two solutions coincide except around @xmath67 , at which height the advective solution is assumed to have the null boundary condition . when radiative losses are added , the two solutions converge even faster ( see fig .  4 in paper i ) .",
    "thus , we use in the present paper the local solution including continuous electron injection and cooling , equation ( [ n_cool ] ) , within the dissipation region . still , in order to quantify the effect of advection , we also discuss the analytical advective solution for the case of dominant synchrotron losses ( equation 40 in paper i ) up to @xmath68 .",
    "we compare it with our model 2 ( section [ hard ] ) , for which synchrotron losses dominate .",
    "on the other hand , the electron advection becomes crucial at @xmath69 , i.e. , above the dissipation region , since the only relativistic electrons there are those advected from @xmath70 .",
    "as we found out in our calculations , relativistic electrons at @xmath71 may still carry a significant fraction of the jet power , @xmath72 , comparable to that carried by the other plasma constituents ( see table [ t : models ] ) .",
    "this power is then radiatively and adiabatically lost at @xmath69 . in order to treat that region ,",
    "we extend the model described in paper i for the analytical treatment of the particle evolution beyond the dissipation zone , as presented in appendix [ advection ] below .",
    "we obtain a very simple formula for @xmath73 , given by equations ( [ n_adv][gamma_max ] ) .    after specifying the fixed system parameters as given in table [ cygx1 ] ,",
    "the six free parameters of a model are @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath42 , @xmath77 , and @xmath47 , which can be determined using the spectrum observed from cyg x-1 , augmented by theoretical considerations .",
    "the dimensionless factor @xmath74 determines @xmath58 .",
    "we assume here @xmath78 , which reproduces the cutoff of the mev tail of cyg x-1 .",
    "we choose the value of either @xmath79 or 300 , which corresponds to a usual single power - law injection or that with a low - energy cutoff due to equipartition with ion energy ( see the discussion in paper i ) .",
    "the remaining four parameters can be determined by four other observables .",
    "here we choose them as the flux at 15 ghz , the turnover energy ( table [ cygx1 ] ) , and the fluxes at 1 mev and 1 gev .",
    "the main observational uncertainty is the jet flux at 1 mev . as discussed in section [ intro ] , the observed mev flux may or may not be due to synchrotron emission of the jet .",
    "if we assume it does , then we specify @xmath80 uniquely .",
    "if we attribute the mev tail to another process ( most likely hybrid comptonization in the accretion flow ) , then we are free to choose @xmath80 , as long as it is well below the observed flux .",
    "we then follow the solution method outlined in section 6 of paper i.    in table [ t : models ] , we list the obtained values of the free parameters except for @xmath75 , for which we provide instead both the total rate and the power in the injected electrons , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , given by equations ( 54 ) and ( 55 ) of paper i , respectively .",
    "table [ t : models ] also gives the lorentz factor of electrons providing the dominant contribution to the emission ( at @xmath42 ) at @xmath34 , @xmath83 , and the lorentz factor at which @xmath84 steepens due to radiative cooling , @xmath85 .",
    "the electron equipartition parameter , @xmath86 , depends on the pressure of relativistic electrons , which evolves along the outflow due to radiative cooling .",
    "radiative cooling influences also the power carried by relativistic electrons , @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we give both quantities at the maximum height of the dissipation region , where they are maximized .",
    "the magnetization parameter , @xmath12 , is the ratio of the magnetic enthalpy to the particle enthalpy .",
    "the latter has a major contribution from ions , while in our model only a lower limit on the ion density is obtained from the density of relativistic electrons .",
    "the ion enthalpy is also proportional to the ion contribution to the jet power , @xmath87 .",
    "thus , @xmath12 and @xmath87 parameters in table [ t : models ] correspond to the upper and lower limits , respectively .",
    "also , the flux of all the electrons in the jet , @xmath88 , may be contributed substantially by cold electrons , and therefore the given value is a lower limit only . table [ t : models ] also gives the jet power in the magnetic field , @xmath13 , the components of the radiative power in the synchrotron , @xmath89 , and the bbc process , @xmath90 , and the power lost adiabatically , @xmath91 .",
    "mzc13 have presented jet models of cyg x-1 neglecting cooling and advection , and instead assuming the electron steady - state distribution to be a single power law with an exponential cutoff ; such an approach is commonly used in the literature ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . for completeness",
    ", we also give the parameters of the models of mzc13 in table [ t : models ] .",
    "we note that an inner part of the counterjet , @xmath92 cm , is obscured by the accretion disc .",
    "also , the counterjet emission is de - boosted .",
    "thus , we do not include the synchrotron emission from the counterjet in our model spectra . on the other hand ,",
    "we take into account the counterjet contribution to the compton spectra , which is enchanced due to the compton anisotropy , favouring large - angle scattering .",
    "also , we include the counterjet in calculating components of the system power .",
    "we first consider the case with the standard , soft electron - injection spectrum , @xmath93 ( corresponding to the spectral index of the uncooled optically - thin synchrotron emission of @xmath94 ) . with this",

    "the obtained value of @xmath42 corresponds to the maximum dimensionless height of @xmath95 .",
    "the spectrum around the turnover energy at the jet base is due to the uncooled electrons . in this model , the mev tail is not produced by the jet , but instead has to be due to a different process , most likely hybrid comptonization in the accretion flow @xcite .",
    "we find that virtually all the observed emission ( including radio ) originates from @xmath96 .",
    "although the electrons still carry a significant power at @xmath68 , @xmath97 in table [ t : models ] , that power is lost at @xmath69 mostly adiabatically , with only @xmath98 radiated away via the bbc process , which is in part due to the softness of the injected electron distribution .",
    "the electron equipartition parameter is @xmath99 , but since electron energy density is dominated by the lowest energy particles , we can reach @xmath100 by a moderate increase in @xmath47 ( which is very weakly constrained by the observed spectrum ) . alternatively , we can obtain @xmath100 by a slight decrease of @xmath76 , but then the stronger magnetic field required to reproduce @xmath101 would result in @xmath102 . this inequality would imply that the synchrotron emission at the turnover is dominated by the cooled electrons , and the emission continuum has no cooling break in its optically - thin part ( which , however , is not constrained by observations ) .",
    "the magnetization parameter is very low , and the flow dynamics is dominated by ions .",

    "[ phi ] , the emitted bbc flux is strongest at the superior conjunction , due to the compton anisotropy .",

    "thus , the magic flare can possibly be explained if most of the tev emission took place at such heights , as earlier found by @xcite .    unfortunately , the available broad - band data at the time of the magic flare are rather sparse , and do not allow for a unique determination of the model parameters . in particular , there was neither radio nor gev monitoring around this event .",
    "observations simultaneous with magic are available only in the x - ray band , see the _ swift_-bat and _ rxte_-asm data in @xcite , and _ integral _ data in @xcite .",
    "however , since production of x - rays is strongly dominated by the accretion flow , those data do not provide spectral constraints on the models of the tev flare production in a jet .",
    "still , the found coincidence of the tev flare with the observed increase of the x - ray activity strongly suggests that the tev flare resulted from a temporary change of the conditions at the jet base .",
    "since the duration of the flare , @xmath208s , is longer than the observer - frame time of propagation of the jet over the region where most of bbc radiation is produced , @xmath156 , such an event can be approximated by a steady - state model .",
    "we thus consider two simple scenarios , representing modifications of the soft and hard injection models . in the first one , we temporarily increase the electron injection rate . in the second scenario , we assume that some unspecified process decreases temporarily the jet magnetic energy flux , and increases the amplitude of the electron distribution ; this results in a temporarily increased rate of the compton scattering . in both cases ,",
    "we keep all other parameters fixed as before .",
    "naturally , more than one parameter could have changed in reality , including , e.g. , @xmath74 in addition to @xmath209 and @xmath16 .",

    "then , the energy losses at high @xmath1 and @xmath106 ( which are responsible for the tev emission ) are almost completely dominated by the adiabatic and bbc processes .",
    "thus , there will be a unique shape of the high - energy bbc spectrum , dependent only on the form of the acceleration function , @xmath209 .",
    "the @xmath1-ray flux of that spectrum is then @xmath210 , and independent of the model magnetic field .",
    "therefore , this scenario requires a temporary increase of the acceleration rate in order to explain the flare .",
    "this could have happened , e.g. , due to an interaction of the jet with a clump in the stellar wind of the companion @xcite .",
    "below we consider a simple model assuming an increase of the injection normalization , @xmath75 .",
    "we note , however , that the increase could involve only the high - energy segment of the electron distribution ( at @xmath211 ) , which is responsible for the production of the @xmath212 tev photons .    in the local approximation ,",
    "the steady - state electron distribution is thus given by equation ( [ n_cool ] ) with @xmath213 .",

    "we also show the flux of the hard - state flare reported at a different time by _ agile _",

    "a caveat for this scenario is the required high amplitude of the increase of the acceleration rate .    on the other hand ,",
    "the increase of the @xmath1-ray flux due to a reduction of @xmath16 can happen in models in which cooling of electrons with @xmath215 is dominated by the synchrotron process .",

    "the radio / ir flux has decreased by a factor of several .",
    "the flux at @xmath218 tev is almost completely due to the emission produced at @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , the effect of pair absorption is moderate , reducing the flux at @xmath218 tev by at most @xmath219 per cent .",
    "we note that the alfvn time scale , @xmath220 , where @xmath221 is the alfvn speed , can be rather short . in model 2 , @xmath222 and",
    "hence @xmath223 s at @xmath182 ( in the observer s frame ) . also , the cooling time of @xmath211 electrons ( responsible for upscattering of stellar blackbody photons to tev energies ) is @xmath224 s in this model at @xmath182 .",

    "an observational test between the two scenarios may be provided by radio measurements simultaneous with a possible future tev flare . in the first scenario ,",

    "one possibility is the energy associated with colliding shells at different bulk lorentz factors , @xmath227 ( where the index @xmath24 numbers the shells ) in the internal shock model @xcite . in this case , electrons are likely accelerated via the diffuse 1st - order fermi process operating at shock fronts .",
    "another possibility is the magnetic energy source , in which case electrons may be accelerated directly via magnetic reconnection and reconnection - driven turbulence .    in the first scenario , our assumed jet bulk lorentz factor , @xmath30 ,",
    "should be interpreted as the average of the shell lorentz factors , @xmath228 .",
    "the available energy is , on the other hand , related to the lorentz factor dispersion , @xmath229 .",

    "table [ t : models ] gives the values of @xmath87 corresponding to cold ions associated with relativistic electrons . since ions may be not cold in the jet rest frame , and since there are likely to be more ions than that implied by the number density of relativistic electrons , the values provided represent lower limits only .",
    "in the model 1 , the above condition is always satisfied , and thus electrons can be readily accelerated in shocks . in the other models , the given lower limits on the ion power are @xmath232 , and thus a large number of additional ions is required for the shock model to be considered as plausible .",
    "such higher values of @xmath87 would also be consistent with the estimates of the jet kinetic power of @xcite and @xcite .",

    "although @xmath236 is the case for all the models considered , the two numbers are close to each other . thus , only a moderate number of ` cold ' electrons suffice for acceleration being a single event for an individual electron .",

    "22 in @xcite ) .",

    "for example , assuming @xmath239 for the model 1 and requiring the @xmath1-ray flux to reproduce the _ fermi _ data result in @xmath240 and @xmath241 g. also , @xmath86 increases by a factor of @xmath99 and @xmath12 and @xmath13 decreases by the same factor .",
    "the other parameters change only slightly .",
    "the average broad - band spectrum of cyg x-1 in the hard state studied by us ( see fig .  [ spectra ] ) includes the ir measurement of the synchrotron turnover , @xmath34 , from @xcite .",
    "we can see that the total ir flux ( dominated by the stellar blackbody and the wind emission ) in the energy range fitted by @xcite is much larger than their claimed jet component .",
    "also , @xcite used a broken power law in their fits whereas theoretical considerations point to a rather gradual curvature ( e.g. , @xcite ) , as supported by a number of observational findings @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite point out the uncertainty of that spectral break measurement .",
    "furthermore , there is a possible ir contribution from synchrotron emission of hybrid ( thermal+non - thermal ) plasma in the accretion flow @xcite , which might affect the non - stellar fluxes measured in that region .",

    "another uncertainty is the origin of the mev tail , which can be either from the jet or the accretion flow . as discussed in section [ intro ] , at the moment there is no compelling statistical evidence for the former possibility .",
    "therefore , we have discussed the jet models which may account for the observed mev tail ( models 2 and 2 m ) , along with the models which are characterized by negligible mev fluxes ( models 1 and 1 m ) .",
    "we also point out the fact that the observed synchrotron emission below the turnover frequency is contributed by both optically - thick and optically - thin regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) . given the slopes of this emission with the height ( see fig .  [ syn_z_profile ] ) , most of that emission is from optically - thin regions .",
    "this invalidates the polarization model of cyg x-1 of @xcite , who assumed that the radio emission of cyg x-1 originates entirely in synchrotron self - absorbed medium .",
    "since the maximum polarization degree in the optically - thick regime is much lower than that of optically - thin synchrotron emission @xcite , @xcite concluded that this is a possible reason for the low linear polarization of the source at 5 ghz ( with the derived upper limit @xmath245 per cent ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this , in turn , allowed their model polarization of the fully optically - thin synchrotron emission to be high ( almost 100 per cent , see fig .  1 therein ) . however , since the 5 ghz emission originates mostly from optically - thin parts of the jet , as shown in fig .",
    "[ syn_z_profile ] , the low upper limit on its polarization implies that the optically - thin synchrotron emission is also weakly polarized , with a similar upper limit on the polarization as that measured at 5 ghz .",
    "these considerations allow , in fact , to rule out our models 2 and 2 m as a viable explanation of the very high mev polarization in cyg x-1 claimed by @xcite and @xcite . in those models ,",
    "the bulk of the observed mev emission originates from the @xmath246 regions ( see fig .  [ bc_emissivity ] ) , where the 5 ghz emission is optically thin , and at most weakly polarized .",
    "if the mev polarization is therefore real , more complex jet models are required . in this context , the operation of the soft gamma - ray detector on board the _ astro - h _ satellite @xcite , enabling hard x - ray polarimetry of bright celestial sources , is much anticipated .",
    "we also comment here on the model of @xcite , in which the mev polarization originates in a nonthermal corona around the black hole .",
    "it appears that their equation ( 2 ) is in error .",
    "it gives the fractional polarization from a magnetic field configuration with an axial symmetry , following the results of @xcite .",
    "the fractional polarization is given by @xcite as a function of the field components independent of the viewing angle of the system .",
    "however , this appears impossible in the case of axial symmetry , in which , e.g. , viewing the system along the axis would result in null net polarization .",
    "indeed , the corresponding equations ( 3536 ) in @xcite are given in terms of the field components _ projected on the sky _ rather than the intrinsic ones .",
    "taking this into account introduces an additional factor of @xmath247 in equation ( 1 ) of @xcite , which reduces the polarization by a factor of 4.3 for our assumed inclination , which is clearly much below the fractional polarization claimed by @xcite .",
    "this appears to rule out that model .",

    "@xcite found that @xmath2481/2 of the emission at 8.4 ghz is unresolved , with the resolution of 3 mas , corresponding to @xmath249 for the distance and jet inclination adopted here .",
    "thus , our model 1 is characterized by a deficit radio emission above @xmath250 , what requires an additional source of the energy dissipation at large radii . on the other hand ,",
    "model 2 appears approximately consistent with the radio observations .",
    "we have found that the bbc component ( i.e. , scattering of stellar blackbody photons ) strongly dominates over the ssc and xc ones in high - energy @xmath1-rays .",
    "this predicts a relative weakness of high - energy @xmath1-ray emission from low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "so far , this appears to be confirmed by the lack of a detection of any such binary in the gev range .",

    "we have considered two different variants of the developed jet model . in one ,",
    "the observed mev tail is assumed to originate in the accretion flow",

    "we find that in this case the _",
    "fermi_-lat measurements impose very tight constraints on the jet magnetic field , which has to be significantly above the equipartition level in order to avoid an overproduction of gev - energy @xmath1-rays . also , the electron injection index has to be hard , @xmath252 .",
    "importantly , however , the bulk of the mev jet synchrotron emission turns out to originate in the same regions as the jet radio emission .",

    "we have also modelled the tev flare of cyg x-1 observed by magic @xcite .",
    "we have speculated that it could have been due to a magnetic reconnection event temporarily decreasing the jet magnetic field , but only assuming hard electron injection .",
    "alternatively , it could have been due to a temporary increase of the acceleration rate by a factor of , at least , @xmath254 , around @xmath211 , in models with soft electron injection .",
    "finally , in appendix [ advection ] , we have derived equations describing the electron distribution in jet regions above the dissipation region , where the distribution is governed solely by the advection and radiative losses .",
    "these equations allow for a very simple treatment of jet models with acceleration taking place only close to the jet base @xcite , in which case advection is of a crucial effect at higher heights .",
    "this provides an important extension to the results of paper i.",
