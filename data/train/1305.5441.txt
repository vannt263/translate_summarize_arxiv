    "the origin of the moon and the circumstances of its dynamical evolution remain unclear to date , despite the numerous studies on this issue .",
    "the low eccentricity ( @xmath0 ) and the exactly synchronous rotation suggest a nearly perfect equilibrium state , which is the end - point of dynamical spin - orbit evolution @xcite .",
    "they also point at a protracted history of dynamical interaction with the earth and the sun , in which tidal dissipation undoubtedly played a crucial role . in the framework of the giant impact theory of moon s origin ,",
    "tidal dissipation is responsible for the expansion of the orbit and damping of eccentricity @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations validating this hypothesis have been based on much simplified and _ ad hoc _ models of tides , which should not be used for planets and moons of terrestrial composition @xcite . in recent years , a more realistic model of tidal dissipation in solid bodies was proposed , which combines the viscoelastic response with the inelastic creep @xcite . in the framework of this model ,",
    "the capture of mercury into the current 3:2 spin - orbit resonance becomes a likely and natural outcome even without involving the core - mantle friction and episodes of high orbital eccentricity @xcite , which has been a difficult issue for the previous theories .",
    "for example , the constant time lag ( ctl ) model predicts capture probabilities into 3:2 of less than @xmath1 for a wide range of parameters @xcite . within the efroimsky ( 2012 )",
    "model , the secular tidal torque is rendered by a darwin - kaula expansion over the fourier modes of the tide .",
    "each term of the series assumes , in the vicinity of the appropriate resonance , the shape of a kink . as the tidal mode corresponding to the term transcends zero ,",
    "the term swiftly , but continuously , changes its sign vanishing at the resonance frequency .",
    "this behaviour makes the efroimsky torque very efficient at trapping the spin rate into resonances of higher order than the synchronous rotation . assuming a terrestrial composition for the super - earth gj 581d , @xcite concluded that this potentially habitable exoplanet is more likely to be found at a 2:1 spin - orbit resonance rather than 1:1 . in this paper ,",
    "i reassess the probabilities of capture of the moon into supersynchronous resonances .",
    "comprehensive equations for the polar tidal torque ( i.e. , the component directed along the axis of rotation ) , including the fast oscillating terms , can be found , for example , in @xcite .",
    "they are not reproduced here for brevity .",
    "the secular term of the torque , @xmath2 , is strongly dependent on tidal frequency in the narrow vicinity of spin - orbit resonances @xmath3 for integer @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the mean motion and @xmath6 is the sidereal spin rate . the characteristic kink - shape of the near - resonant torque is present at both 1:1 and 3:2 resonances of the moon , but the former is by far larger than the latter and the other , higher - order resonances ( fig .",
    "[ kink.fig ] ) .",
    "the torque is positive , or accelerating , at forcing frequencies below the resonance value and negative , or decelerating , above it .",
    "the very steep decline between the two peaks occupies a narrow band of frequencies for realistic rhelogies . despite the relatively small amplitude of the kink ( compared to a typical amplitude of the triaxiality - caused torque )",
    ", it acts as an efficient trap for a planet trying to traverse the resonance .",
    "the numerical simulations presented in this paper were performed with physical parameters listed in table 1 .",
    "the andrade parameter @xmath7 has been measured for a diverse list of materials , including silicates , metals , and ices , and found to vary within a fairly narrow range of @xmath8  @xmath9 . the value @xmath10 estimated for hot silicate rocks is used in this paper .",
    "the unrelaxed rigidity modulus @xmath11 takes values between @xmath12 and @xmath13 times @xmath14 pa @xcite .",
    "the assumed value here is @xmath15 pa . the most defining parameter in this model is the maxwell time @xmath16 , which i varied in my analysis between 8 yr and 500 yr ( approximately , the earth s value ) .",
    "the former value corresponds to a warmer satellite with less internal viscosity .",
    "as explained in @xcite , the choice of a small maxwell time for the moon , only 8 years , may be justified by the likely presence of a high percentage of partial melt in the lower lunar mantle .",
    "the presence of partial melt indirectly follows from the modeling carried out by @xcite and also from an earlier study by @xcite .    [ cols= \" < , > , > , > \" , ]             fig .",
    "[ capt.fig]a shows a typical example of numerical integration of the moon s spin rate , which includes both secular and oscillating components of tides raised by the earth , as well as the traxiality - induced torques .",
    "the initial rate is @xmath17 , and the maximum step of integration is @xmath18 yr . the plot shows the characteristic features of resonance capture : the spin rate decelerates steadily and at a nearly constant rate on this timescale , the amplitude of free librations grows toward the resonance and suddenly doubles upon the capture , after which it starts to decline due to the dissipation of kinetic energy .",
    "more remarkable is the fact that the moon is captured into the 3:2 resonance , despite its nearly circular orbit .",
    "thus , capture of the moon into supersynchronous resonances is possible with the present - day parameters .",
    "there are two ways of estimating the probability of capture into a spin - orbit resonance with a given set of parameters .",
    "the first way is brute - force integrations of the differential equation of second order for the angular acceleration caused by the polar component of the tidal torque acting on the moon , and for a grid of initial phase space parameters @xmath19 . for the sake of simplicity , but without a loss of generality , these integrations are started at zero mean anomaly , @xmath20@xmath21 , i.e. , at perigees . the implicit assumption used in this method is that any sidereal azimuthal angle @xmath22 is equally likely for a given spin rate @xmath6 when the moon passes through a perigee .",
    "i performed small - scale simulations , integrating the corresponding second - order ode twenty times for these initial parameters : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , the maxwell time being fixed at 8 yr .",
    "i found 12 captures and 8 passages , resulting in a capture probability of roughly @xmath27 .",
    "the other way of estimating capture probabilities is the adaptation of the derivation proposed by @xcite for the constant phase lag and the constant time lag tidal models .",
    "the details of this calculation are given in @xcite and , in greater detail , in @xcite .",
    "[ prob.fig]a and [ prob.fig]b depict the results for two characteristic values of @xmath16 , 8 yr and 500 yr , respectively .",
    "the results also depend on the measure of quadrupole elongation , @xmath28 , but to a lesser degree .",
    "it should be noted that this semi - analytical calculation is based on the assumption that the energy offset from zero at the beginning of the last libration above the resonance is uniformly distributed between @xmath29 and the total energy dissipated by the secular tidal torque along the separatrix trajectory during one free libration cycle ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this assumption is probably quite good as long as the magnitude of the permanent figure s torque is much greater than the magnitude of tidal torques .",
    "caution should be exercised with this approach for nearly axially - symmetrical bodies , which are more easily captured into spin - orbit resonances , all other parameters being the same .",
    "the strong nonlinearity of the tidal force may skew the probability distribution of the residual rotational energy at the beginning of the last pre - resonance libration .",
    "given this caveat , we confirm that the capture probabilities strongly depend on the value of @xmath16 .",
    "for example , as shown in fig .",
    "[ prob.fig ] , the probability of capture into 3:2 is @xmath30 for @xmath31 yr and @xmath32 for @xmath33 yr . at first glance , these numbers may seem to be consistent with the current state of moon s rotation , as the probability of traversing the higher resonances and entrapment in the 1:1 resonance ( which is always certain ) is at least @xmath34 for a wide range of the least - known parameter @xmath16 . however , recall that these estimates are obtained with the current low eccentricity .",
    "why the high probabilities of capture into a supersynchronous rotation represents a hard theoretical problem will be discussed in  [ discu.sec ] .",
    "the secular tidal torque in the model under investigation is negative at the present - day eccentricity for any @xmath35 except for close vicinities of a few low - order spin - orbit resonances .",
    "therefore , the general action of the tides raised by the earth on the moon is to slow down the prograde rotation of the latter .",
    "of special importance is the characteristic spin - down time , which , following the previous literature ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , can be defined as @xmath36 with @xmath37 being the angular acceleration caused by the secular tidal torque @xmath38 . in this computation , as ever , the obliquity of the lunar equator is ignored .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ spindown.fig ] for a grid of points in @xmath39 , chosen in such a way as to avoid the sharp features at spin - orbit resonances , for two values of eccentricity : @xmath40 and 0.3 , and for the current value of semimajor axis , which is about @xmath41 earth s radii .",
    "let us recall that in the `` work - horse '' tidal model of constant time lag ( ctl ) , the deceleration of spin is arrested when the state of pseudosynchronous rotation is reached at @xmath42 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in reality , pseudosynchronous equilibria are unstable for terrestrial planets and moons @xcite .",
    "therefore , at small or moderate eccentricities , the moon is bound to spin - down continuously until it is captured into one of the spin - orbit resonances . furthermore , most of the theories of moon s origin suggest that the moon was formed much closer to the earth than it is now @xcite .",
    "the characteristic spin - down times are strong functions of the semimajor axis through the relation to the polar torque , @xmath43 , where @xmath2 is the frequency - dependent quality function defined in @xcite . for example , if we compute the characteristic times for the same relative rates @xmath39 and @xmath44 , we obtain practically the same curves as in fig .",
    "[ spindown.fig ] , but scaled down by approximately 5000 .",
    "observe that the dependence of tidal dissipation on @xmath45 is much weaker here than in the ctl model , which predicts @xmath46 @xcite , due to the fast decline of the quality function @xmath2 with tidal frequency .",
    "( upper curve ) and @xmath47 ( lower curve ) . in both cases ,",
    "the current value of semimajor axis is assumed , and @xmath16 is set at 8 yr.,width=309 ]",
    "one of the theoretical difficulties that the currently dominating giant impact theory of lunar formation encounters is the excess angular momentum of the early earth - moon system .",
    "@xcite suggested a dynamical scenario , which allows a fast - spinning proto - earth to loose a sufficiently large amount of angular momentum after a debris disk forming impact through a relatively short epoch of capture into the evection resonance .",
    "as first suggested by yoder in 1976 , according to @xcite , and mathematically developed by @xcite , the lunar perigee is locked in a synchronous precession with the orbital motion of the earth around the sun , and the long axis of the lunar orbit stays at @xmath48 from the sun - earth line .",
    "this resonance defeats the tidal actions of circularization ( secular decrease of eccentricity ) and orbital expansion , allowing the eccentricity to remain high for a span of time sufficiently long for the earth to spin down . in the numerical simulation presented by @xcite , the evection resonance holds for approximately 60 kyr .",
    "unfortunately , the authors used a variant of the `` constant-@xmath49 '' model , which is not adequate for solid or partially melted bodies @xcite .",
    "their conclusions about the early dynamical evolution of the moon - earth system should be taken with a grain of salt . the main difference between this _ ad hoc _ model and",
    "the realistic rheological model is that in the latter , the quality function is a rising function at positive tidal frequencies asymptotically approaching zero ( fig .",
    "[ kink.fig ] ) .",
    "the weakening of tidal dissipation at high tidal frequencies may resolve the problem of overheating the moon , as discussed in ",
    "[ spindown.sec ] .",
    "the spin - down of the early moon is still fast enough ( a few kyr ) to justify the widely accepted assumption in numerical simulations that the moon is already synchronized by the time the evection resonance sets in .",
    "so much the more puzzling becomes the issue how the moon traversed the higher spin - orbit resonances on its way to synchronous rotation .",
    "indeed , capture into the 3:2 resonance becomes certain at @xmath50 for @xmath31 yr , and @xmath51 for @xmath33 yr ( fig .",
    "[ prob.fig ] ) .",
    "the simulations by @xcite suggest that the orbital eccentricity acquires much higher values shortly after the onset of the evection resonance .",
    "furthermore , these probabilities are computed for the current mean motion of the moon , whereas the giant impact theory implies much smaller orbits for the early moon , down to @xmath52 .",
    "somewhat counter - intuitively , the probabilities of capture into a spin - orbit resonance become smaller for tighter orbits , all other parameters being the same .",
    "for example , the probability of capture into 3:2 is only @xmath10 for the moon at @xmath53 , @xmath31 yr and @xmath54 .",
    "could the moon traverse the 3:2 resonance ( and all the higher resonances ) while it was still very close to the earth ?",
    "our calculations show that the moon is inevitably entrapped in the 3:2 resonance at @xmath53 , if the eccentricity exceeds @xmath55 .",
    "but the evection mechanism quickly boosts the orbital eccentricity to much higher values , up to @xmath56 .",
    "therefore , the only realistic possibility for the moon to avoid the 3:2 resonance within the giant impact scenario is to spin down to its present - day synchronous state before the onset of the perigee precession resonance .",
    "this may take , depending on the initial spin rate , up to 10 kyr .",
    "this scenario also requires that the moon remains fairly cold and viscous during this pre - evection stage , which , due to the proximity to the earth , may prove another hard problem .",
    "simple calculations based on the formulae in @xcite show that the dissipation of tidal energy in the moon may exceed @xmath57 j yr@xmath58 for @xmath59 , @xmath31 yr and @xmath54 in the vicinity of the 3:2 resonance .",
    "this may raise the temperature of the moon by @xmath60 k in 1 kyr .",
    "the rise of temperature may be much faster at smaller distances from the earth because of the implicit @xmath61 relation . for this calculation",
    ", i updated eq .",
    "( 31 ) in @xcite by including the realistic frequency - dependent quality function @xmath62 instead of the constant quality factor @xmath63 used in that paper , and inserting the actual frequency mode .",
    "the latter update takes into account that the original equation was derived specifically for the synchronous resonance .",
    "the resulting general equation is : @xmath64 ^ 2\\,\\chi_{2mpq}k_c(\\chi_{2mpq } ) \\label{dedt.eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the gravitational constant , @xmath66 is the mass of the earth , @xmath67 is the radius of the moon , @xmath45 is the semimajor axis of the orbit , @xmath68 is the moon s equator obliquity , @xmath69 are the inclination functions , @xmath70 are the eccentricity functions , @xmath71 is the tidal frequency , and @xmath5 is the orbital mean motion .",
    "this estimation is limited to the leading degree @xmath72 , because the higher - degree terms are smaller in amplitude by at least several orders of magnitude .",
    "the specific equations for the quality function can be found in @xcite .",
    "one of the essential differences between eq .",
    "[ dedt.eq ] and eq .",
    "( 31 ) in @xcite is the positively defined tidal frequency @xmath73 in the former replacing the factor @xmath74 in the latter , which can change sign .",
    "an accurate derivation of the @xmath75 equation shows that the rate of tidal dissipation is proportional to @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the frequency - dependent dynamical love number , and @xmath78 is the degree-@xmath79 phase lag . observing",
    "that @xmath77 is an even function of the tidal mode , and @xmath78 is an odd function , this product can be more concisely written as the positively - defined function @xmath80 of the physical frequency .",
    "the resulting rate of tidal heating from eq .",
    "[ dedt.eq ] may therefore be significantly higher than the previously published estimates .",
    "the leading terms of the quality function @xmath81 vanish at the corresponding tidal modes , for example , @xmath82 for @xmath83 , turning to zero the tidal torque and acceleration .",
    "that does not , however , imply that tidal dissipation almost ceases when the planet is locked in a spin - orbit resonance .",
    "the presence of other @xmath84-modes , multiplied by their tidal frequencies , makes up for a significant net dissipation .",
    "the character of the tidal heating versus spin rate dependence is distinctly different with this model , to be discussed elsewhere .",
    "@xcite briefly mention the possibility that the moon was locked into the 3:2 spin - orbit resonance for a finite time span .",
    "a similar suggestion was made by @xcite , who also found evidence for a high - eccentricity episode in the dynamical history of the moon from its present - day shape .",
    "capture into a spin - orbit resonance should have happened before or at the very beginning of the evection resonance , while the distance to the earth remained small .",
    "if the subsequent rise of eccentricity finds the moon still in the 3:2 spin - orbit resonance , the tidal dissipation becomes a few orders of magnitude stronger , and a complete or partial melt - down may follow .",
    "for example , the dissipation for @xmath59 , @xmath31 yr and @xmath85 is @xmath86 j yr@xmath58",
    ". this would be sufficient to heat the moon by @xmath87 k per century .",
    "if the epoch of high eccentricity during the evection resonance lasts for 40 kyr , the temperature rises by @xmath88 k , which is above the melting point of silicates , including olivine and pyroxene .",
    "besides , it is not obvious what kind of dynamical action could drive the moon out of the resonance , apart from a fortuitous high - velocity impact from an external body . once captured into a spin - orbit resonance ,",
    "a triaxial body can traverse it only through a small opening in the phase space @xcite .",
    "in particular , the angle between the `` long '' axis of the body and the center line should reach nearly @xmath48 at perigee for this to happen .",
    "upon capture into the 3:2 resonance , the amplitude of the angle variation is close to that threshold value , but the lunar free librations are damped quickly because of the high tidal dissipation , and the forced librations are usually insignificant . beyond the evection resonance ,",
    "the eccentricity is bound to decrease , further reducing the amplitude of forced librations .    outside of the giant impact hypothesis of lunar origin ,",
    "other plausible scenarios exist , which are consistent with the current state of the satellite . if the moon always remained on a low - eccentricity orbit during the initial spin - down epoch , and it was cold and unyielding to the tidal forces , it could naturally traverse the supersynchronous resonances before settling in the 1:1 resonance .",
    "alternatively , the moon could have a retrograde rotation at its formation .",
    "the tidal pull of the earth in this case will slow down the retrograde spin , and then will spin the moon up in the prograde direction , until it falls into the 1:1 resonance , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kink.fig]b .",
    "the only obstacle on this way is the subsynchronous 1:2 resonance .",
    "this resonance , however , is significantly weaker then the 1:1 and 3:2 resonances , and an unhindered passage is secured with not too high eccentricities .",
