    "the current implementation and operation of traffic control schemes by internet service providers ( isps ) for shared access ( e.g. , cable internet or ethernet passive optical network ( epon ) ) prevent subscribers from getting the benefits of full sharing of resources available in the network ; due to the arrangement of traffic shapers and a scheduler in the access switch shown in fig.@xmath0[fg : isp_traffic_control ] , the capability of allocating available bandwidth by the scheduler ( e.g. , weighted fair queueing ( wfq ) ) is limited to _ traffic already shaped _ by token bucket filters ( tbfs ) per service contracts with subscribers .",
    "this means that , even though the network is shared access , it is being managed by isps as if it is dedicated access . with the current practice of isp traffic control in shared access",
    ", therefore , we can not expect any fundamental sharing of resources in the long term except for that in the short term controlled by the size of a token bucket @xcite .",
    "in fact , the allocation of excess bandwidth in a shared link has long been discussed in the context of quality of service ( qos ) control in routers ( e.g. @xcite ) and recently in the more specific context of isp traffic control in shared access in @xcite and @xcite ; the major goal of the latter discussions is to allocate excess bandwidth among active subscribers in a fair and efficient way while not compromising the service contracts specified by the original token bucket algorithm for conformant subscribers in all time scales and with practical implementation .",
    "the business aspect of the excess bandwidth allocation in isp traffic control , however , is yet to be investigated because the flat - rate service plan  dominant one in current residential broadband access market  is so tightly coupled with traffic shaping based on tbfs that it can not exploit the excess bandwidth allocation .    in this paper",
    "we report the current status of our research on designing flexible yet practical isp service plans leveraging the excess bandwidth allocation enabled by the recently proposed isp traffic control schemes in shared access networks .",
    "we first consider an architecture for hybrid isp traffic control to gradually introduce the excess bandwidth allocation while providing backward compatibility with the existing traffic control infrastructure and then discuss the requirements for a new service plan to provide benefits for both isp and its subscribers compared to the existing flat - rate service plans .",
    "then we provide a design example for a new service plan meeting the requirements derived in this paper and discuss the impact of key design parameters on isp revenue and subscriber qos .",
    "much of existing work on internet pricing focuses on congestion pricing based on the game theory ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , however , the game - theory - based framework does not fit the current practice of isp traffic control and dominant flat - rate service plans .",
    "rather , a hybrid approach like the proposal for a flexible service plan based on both flat - rate and usage - based ones in @xcite seems more practical and appealing to isps and subscribers , which is still static in that there is no interaction between isp and its subscribers during the operation .",
    "taking the current flat - rate service plan based on traffic shaping by tbfs as a starting point for our design of a new service plan , we propose an architecture for hybrid isp traffic control shown in fig.@xmath0[fg : hybrid_traffic_control ] in order to gradually introduce the excess bandwidth allocation in shared access . for backward compatibility with the existing infrastructure for traffic control and pricing ,",
    "a group of subscribers for this new service plan is treated as one _ virtual _ subscriber ( i.e. , their traffic is collectively controlled by a single tbf and also under a flat - rate service plan during the plan design procedure ) ; for a new service plan leveraging excess bandwidth allocation , on the other hand , the traffic from each subscriber belonging to this group is individually controlled by the new isp traffic control scheme enabling excess bandwidth allocation within the group .",
    "note that the migration toward fully - shared access will be finished when those subscribers under traditional tbf - based traffic shaping and flat - rate service plans also move under new traffic control schemes enabling excess bandwidth allocation and new flexible service plans , where all the network resources are fully and efficiently shared among the subscribers .      for a new service plan to be acceptable ,",
    "it is desirable to guarantee that there should be no disadvantage for both isp and its subscribers compared to the existing flat - rate service plans .",
    "here we discuss and derive requirements for a new service plan in terms of parameters for existing flat - rate service plans .",
    "consider the case of designing a new service plan based on the two existing flat - rate service plans specified as follows :    * lower - rate flat - rate service plan ( for the individual subscribers ) * * monthly price : @xmath1 * * token generation rate : @xmath2 * * token bucket size : @xmath3 * higher - rate flat - rate service plan ( for the virtual subscriber ) * * monthly price : @xmath4 * * token generation rate : @xmath5 * * token bucket size : @xmath6    based on the arrangement of traffic shaper and new traffic control scheme enabling excess bandwidth allocation shown in fig.@xmath0[fg : hybrid_traffic_control ] , we are to provide a new service plan which is specified as follows :    * new hybrid service plan * * number of subscribers : @xmath7 * * monthly price : @xmath8 * * token generation rate : @xmath2 * * token bucket size : @xmath3    @xmath9 is a fixed , minimum price , and @xmath10 is a usage - based price function where @xmath11 is the usage of excess bandwidth ( i.e. , the amount of non - conformant traffic ) .",
    "note that this group of @xmath7 subscribers is considered as one virtual subscriber as for traffic management and pricing in deriving requirements for a new service plan in the following .",
    "first of all , for this new service plan to be feasible in terms of subscriber qos , the sum of token generation rates for lower - rate plan subscribers should be no greater than the token generation rate of higher - rate plan , i.e. , @xmath12 or @xmath13    from isp s perspective , the revenue from the new service plans should be no less than either of that from the higher - rate flat - rate service plan for the virtual subscriber or the sum of those from the lower - rate flat - rate service plan for individual subscribers , i.e. , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the usage of excess bandwidth by the @xmath16th subscriber .    from subscribers perspective , on the other hand , the price for the new service plan should be no greater than that of the higher - rate flat - rate service plan and , when there is no usage of excess bandwidth , equal to that of the lower - rate one , i.e. , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the maximum amount of excess bandwidth that one subscriber can use for a month .",
    "@xmath18 corresponds to the extreme case where only one subscriber uses all the available excess bandwidth for a whole month with all other subscribers inactive , i.e. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a time period for a month .",
    "considering the first term is usually much larger than the second term in ( [ eq : u_max ] ) , @xmath18 can be approximated as follows : @xmath21    as for @xmath10 , we assume that it is a monotone - increasing function with @xmath22 , which gives @xmath23 from ( [ eq : subscriber_requirement2 ] ) . in case of a simple linear function , i.e. , @xmath24 for a nonnegative constant @xmath25 , we obtain the following from ( [ eq : isp_requirement1 ] ) and ( [ eq : subscriber_requirement1 ] ) using ( [ eq : u_max_approx ] ) : @xmath26 in ( [ eq : alpha1 ] ) , because @xmath27 is bounded by @xmath18 , it can be rewritten as follows : @xmath28 also , because the left - hand side of ( [ eq : alpha1 ] ) becomes zero when @xmath29 for @xmath30 , the right - hand side should be no greater than zero , i.e. , @xmath31 or @xmath32    note that , given the two existing flat - rate service plans and a simple linear usage - based price function , ( [ eq : n_condition1 ] ) & ( [ eq : n_condition2 ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha2 ] ) & ( [ eq : alpha3 ] ) provide requirements for the the slope of linear price function ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) and the number of subscribers ( i.e. , @xmath7 ) , respectively . the guidelines for designing a new hybrid service plan based on the results in this section are summarized in table [ tbl : design_guidelines ] .    [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < , < \" , ]      to illustrate how to design a new service plan using the requirements and design guidelines described in sec .",
    "[ sec-2 - 2 ] , here we provide a design example based on the flat - rate service plans from virgin media cable internet @xcite .    according to their service plans",
    ", the lowest tier provides up to 50 mbit / s speed for  26.50 per month , while the highest tier up to 152 mbit / s speed for  39 per month .",
    "the flat - rate service plan parameters , therefore , can be summarized as follows :    * lower - rate flat - rate service plan * * monthly price ( @xmath1 ) :  26.50 per month * * token generation rate ( @xmath2 ) : 50 mbit / s * higher - rate flat - rate service plan * * monthly price ( @xmath4 ) :  39 per month * * token generation rate ( @xmath5 ) : 152 mbit / s    note that token bucket sizes for both service plans are unknown , but they are not used in the requirements for design parameters as discussed in [ sec-2 - 2 ] .",
    "@xmath20 ( assuming 30 days per month ) and @xmath18 in this case become 2.592e+6 s and 2.644e+8 mbit , respectively .    from table [ tbl : design_guidelines ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath33 for this design example , we set @xmath7 to 3 , i.e. , the maximum possible value . for the slope of linear usage - based price function",
    ", we obtain @xmath34 if we take a maximum value for @xmath25 to maximize the revenue of isp , the resulting hybrid service plan is specified as follows :    * hybrid service plan * * number of subscribers : 3 * * monthly price :  @xmath35 * * token generation rate : 50 mbit / s    where @xmath11 is the usage of excess bandwidth in mbit .    with this new hybrid service plan ,",
    "we consider two extreme cases of excess bandwidth utilization :    first , consider a case where only one subscriber is active and utilizes all the available excess bandwidth for the whole month ( i.e. , @xmath11=@xmath18 ) .",
    "the revenue is  92 , which is higher than either @xmath36 or three times of @xmath37 .",
    "second , consider another case where all three subscribers are active and evenly divide the available excess bandwidth ( i.e. , @xmath11=@xmath38 mbit ) .",
    "the revenue in this case is  79.745 , which is still higher than either @xmath36 or three times of @xmath37 .",
    "this design example demonstrates that the new hybrid service plan enables subscribers to enjoy benefits of both flat - rate service plans through excess bandwidth allocation without much increase in monthly payments , while improving the revenue of isp depending on the usage patterns of subscribers .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the issues in current practice of isp traffic shaping and related flat - rate service plans in shared access networks and suggested alternative service plans based on new isp traffic control schemes enabling excess bandwidth .",
    "we have proposed a hybrid isp traffic control architecture to gradually introduce the excess bandwidth allocation in shared access , and , based on the proposed architecture , provided requirements for new service plans leveraging excess bandwidth allocation .",
    "note that the impact of aggregate traffic from the group of subscribers under a new service plan on metro and backbone networks is yet to be investigated because it is likely that the utilization of a group of subscribers is higher than that of a single subscriber under the higher - rate flat - rate service plan .",
