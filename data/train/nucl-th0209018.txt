    "we take the @xmath36 state and all related channels using su(3 ) mesons and baryons within the chiral approach , namely @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "hence we have a problem with ten coupled channels .",
    "the coupled set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : bs1 ] ) were solved in ref.@xcite using a cut off momentum of 630 mev in all channels .",
    "changes in the cut off can be accommodated in terms of changes in @xmath46 , the regularization scale in the dimensional regularization formula for @xmath33 , or in the subtraction constant @xmath47 . in order to obtain the same results as in ref.@xcite at low energies , we set @xmath46 equal to the cut off momentum of 630 mev ( in all channels ) and",
    "then find the values of the subtraction constants @xmath47 such as to have @xmath33 with the same value with the dimensional regularization formula ( eq .  ( [ eq : gpropdr ] ) ) and the cut off formula of @xcite at the @xmath48 threshold .",
    "this determines the values @xmath49 this guarantees that we obtain the same results at low energies as in ref.@xcite and we find indeed that this is the case when we repeat the calculation with the new @xmath33 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : gpropdr ] ) .",
    "then we extend the results at higher energies , looking for the possible appearance of new resonances .",
    "for the purpose of this study let us recall that ref.@xcite obtained the @xmath14 resonance which we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] obtained from the @xmath50 spectrum .",
    "next we go to higher energies and search for new resonances .",
    "[ fig : kn0 ] shows the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath51 scattering amplitude , obtained in ref.@xcite normalized as in the partial wave analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite . remarkably , the amplitudes shown by the solid lines , which are obtained using the low - energy parameters in eq .",
    "( [ eq : coef ] ) , show the resonant structure of the @xmath4 appearing at about the right energy and with a similar size compared to the experimental analysis@xcite .",
    "the position of the resonance is quite sensitive to the parameter @xmath52 and moderately sensitive to @xmath53 .",
    "hence , without spoiling the nice agreement at low energies , which is not sensitive to @xmath52 , we exploit the freedom in the parameters by choosing @xmath54 , moving the resonance closer to its experimental position ( dashed lines ) .",
    "su(3 ) symmetry , partly broken here due to the use of physical masses , demands a singlet and an octet of resonances . within @xmath55 ,",
    "we have already identified the singlet @xmath14 and the @xmath51 member of the octet , the @xmath4 .",
    "since we found the partial decay widths and couplings of the @xmath14 to @xmath56 states and the @xmath4 to @xmath9 states to be very large , one is naturally led to identify these two resonances as a  quasibound \" @xmath56 and @xmath9 state , respectively .",
    "searching for the @xmath57 member of the octet , we find that the @xmath57 amplitudes in our model are smooth and show no trace of resonant behavior , in line with experimental observation .",
    "to explore this issue further we conducted a search for the poles of the @xmath58 amplitudes in the second riemann sheet and find two poles in the @xmath51 amplitude ( @xmath59 ) , corresponding to the @xmath14 and the @xmath4 , and one in the @xmath57 amplitude @xmath60 , corresponding - most likely - to the resonance @xmath5 .",
    "the large width found for this resonance may explain why we saw no trace of it in the scattering amplitudes .",
    "the strangeness @xmath1 channel was also investigated using the lippmann- schwinger equation and coupled channels in ref.@xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 resonance was found to be generated dynamically within this approach .",
    "subsequently , work was done in this sector using the procedure of ref.@xcite with subtraction constants in ref.@xcite , and the @xmath6 resonance , as well as the low - energy scattering observables , were well reproduced .",
    "the exception was the isospin 3/2 channel which was not reproduced in this approach nor in @xcite , and neither in @xcite where the @xmath6 resonance was generated together with the @xmath61 at the expense of using more free parameters .",
    "ref.@xcite continued and further improved work along these lines by introducing the @xmath62 channels , which proved essential in reproducing the isospin 3/2 part of the @xmath63 amplitude .",
    "for total zero charge one has six channels in this case , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "the subtraction parameters @xmath70 for the meson - baryon propagators that we obtain in the new fit to the data , are @xmath71 the results obtained for the phase shifts and inelasticities of @xmath63 scattering are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : phinfull ] , where the continuous line corresponds to the calculation while the dotted line is the experimental analysis .",
    "the @xmath6 peak is visible in the phase shifts and inelasticities of the @xmath72 amplitude in the panel .",
    "the peak of the @xmath73 cross section is also well reproduced but strength is missing just after the peak indicating the contribution of higher order partial waves .",
    "figure [ fig : phinfull ] shows that the @xmath74 data are also fairly well reproduced once the @xmath75 channels are introduced in the approach .",
    "these amplitudes are fitted simultaneously to the scattering data and the @xmath76 cross sections and are somewhat different than those determined previously in ref.@xcite .",
    "here we focus on the @xmath12 sector for which , i.e . , the zero - charge states of the coupled - channels are @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 .    in the study of @xmath55 resonances performed in ref.@xcite the @xmath47 parameters were extracted by matching the results to those of ref.@xcite and the range of values obtained , from @xmath83 to @xmath84 , serves as an indication for what we might assume as reasonable natural size parameters in the present @xmath12 study .",
    "we search for poles in the second riemann sheet of the scattering amplitude , focussing on the elastic @xmath85 amplitude in the @xmath86 channel . as a trial run",
    ", we set the four values of the subtraction constants to a value of @xmath87 and we discover a pole at @xmath88 mev .",
    "this would lead to a width around 280 mev , unacceptably large compared to those of the two i=1/2 resonances of interest , the @xmath89 and the @xmath10 , which are reported to be of the order of 50 mev or less .",
    "the mass of the particle , around 1607 mev , would be closer to the @xmath7 resonance .    allowing the subtraction constants @xmath47 to change within a reasonable natural range",
    ", we obtain the results shown in table [ tab : table2 ] . only @xmath90 and @xmath91",
    "are varied , since we find the couplings of the resonance to the @xmath92 and @xmath93 states to be very weak and therefore the results are insensitive to the subtraction constants corresponding to these two channels .",
    "the values of the couplings , calculated from the residue of the diagonal scattering amplitudes @xcite , are also shown in table  [ tab : table2 ] .",
    "the second and third columns in table  [ tab : table2 ] show that a change of 10% in the subtraction constants @xmath90 and @xmath91 modifies the mass of the resonance only slightly but has a larger influence on the width . investigating the dependence of the results on the values of these two subtraction constants we observe that the mass of the resonance is confined to a range around 1600 mev .",
    "the width , on the other hand , can be reduced considerably by a simultaneous increase of the strength of @xmath94 and a decrease of @xmath91 , while keeping both of them negative and still reasonably close to the reference value of @xmath87 . in the last column",
    "we see that the width can be reduced to 130 mev with acceptable values for the coefficients .",
    "while this width might still appear as grossly overestimating the experimental ones , we show below that this is not the case .",
    "since the @xmath7 resonance decays only into @xmath95 final states , it is experimentally visible through the @xmath95 invariant mass distribution in reactions leading , among others , to @xmath96 and @xmath97 particles . our calculated distribution , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : masspixi ] , shows a very interesting feature , namely a smaller apparent width compared to the one obtained at the pole position .",
    "for instance , for the values of the subtraction constants in the last column of table  [ tab : table2 ] we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : masspixi ] ( solid line ) an apparent breit - wigner width of around 50 mev and a shape for the distribution which resembles the experimental peaks observed . this well - known phenomenon , usually referred to as flatt effect @xcite , is due to the presence of a resonance just below the threshold of a channel to which the resonance couples very strongly . in our case",
    "the @xmath98 channel opens at 1611 mev and , as shown in table  [ tab : table2 ] , the resonance couples very strongly to that state .",
    "what actually happens is that at an invariant energy close to the resonance mass the amplitude is given essentially by the inverse of the resonance width .",
    "as soon as the threshold is crossed , the new channel leads to an additional energy - dependent contribution for the width which grows very rapidly with increasing energy .",
    "this produces a fast fall - off for the amplitude , leading to an apparent width much smaller than the actual width at the pole .",
    "this phenomenon has been observed , e.g. , in the case of the @xmath99 meson resonance as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the question now arises which of the two @xmath86 candidates should be identified with the resonance obtained here .",
    "the value found for the mass of the state would suggest identification with the @xmath7 which is rated as a one - star resonance in the pdg and has unknown spin and parity .",
    "the @xmath10 state is better known and is rated as a 3-star resonance .",
    "even if the spin and parity are unknown , there is far more information available for this resonance than for the @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "@xcite gives ratios of partial decay widths having sufficient accuracy for us to draw conclusions from the properties of the @xmath97 resonance found in this work .",
    "we therefore investigate whether the parameters of the theory provide enough flexibility to produce a pole with a real part closer to 1690 mev , since the results of table  [ tab : table2 ] show that , by decreasing the size of @xmath90 or @xmath91 , one increases the mass of the resonance .",
    "however , the presence of the @xmath98 threshold leads to mass values that stabilize around the cusp of this threshold for a certain range of the parameters . continuing to change the @xmath47 parameters beyond this range does not increase the resonance mass but leads to a disappearance of the pole  and with it the resonance .",
    "the above argument clearly favors identifying the resonance found here with the @xmath7 state .    the other argument in favor of the @xmath7 assignment is the following : the results of table  [ tab : table2 ] show that the resonance couples strongly to the @xmath100 and the @xmath101 channels but very weakly to @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "this is opposite to the observed properties of the @xmath10 resonance , for which ref .",
    "@xcite gives a ratio of branching ratios for @xmath92 to @xmath101 around 3 and for @xmath95 to @xmath92 of less than 0.09 .",
    "in our opinion , this argument rules out identifying the resonance found here with the @xmath10 state .    in summary",
    ", we have demonstrated that the chiral approach to the @xmath8 and the other coupled channels , which proved so successful at low energies , extrapolates smoothly to higher energies and provides the basic features of the scattering amplitudes , generating the resonances which would complete the states of the nonet of the @xmath15 excited states .",
    "the qualitative description of the data without adjusting any parameters is telling us that the basic information on the dynamics of these processes is contained in the chiral lagrangians .",
    "there is still some freedom left with the chiral symmetry breaking terms . in our formulation",
    "they would go into the @xmath47 subtraction constants , and the use of different decay constants for each meson , by means of which one could obtain a better description of the data .",
    "the analysis of the poles and the couplings of the resonances to the different channels lead us to identify the strong coupling of the @xmath14 resonance to the @xmath8 state and the large coupling of the @xmath4 resonance to the @xmath9 state , allowing us to classify these resonances as quasibound states of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , respectively . in the @xmath2 sector , the study performed here has allowed us to identify the resonance generated dynamically with the @xmath7 , hence providing a prediction for the spin and parity of this resonance which is currently not assigned by pdg .",
