    "the possible systematic difference in the li abundances in gcs and galactic halo should be studied further in future . ]",
    "the plateau abundance is @xmath23 times smaller than that predicted in standard bbn ( sbbn ) model ( e.g. , @xmath6li / h=@xmath24  @xcite ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for theoretical light element abundances for the baryon density from planck @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations also indicate a break of this plateau shown as small li abundances with large dispersion at lower metallicities of [ fe / h]@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems that we need a mechanism for a metallicity - independent depletion from the primordial abundance to the plateau abundance and also another for a metallicity - dependent depletion from the plateau abundance . in this paper , we focus on the former universal depletion by cosmological processes .",
    "this li problem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) shows that some physical processes have reduced the primordial li abundance in some epoch during or after bbn .",
    "standard stellar model suggests very small depletions of li isotopes in surfaces of mpss @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6li / h abundances of mpss observed today are then approximately interstellar abundances when the mpss formed .",
    "nonstandard processes such as the rotationally induced mixing @xcite , and the turbulent mixing  @xcite have been suggested to reduce the @xmath6li abundance in stellar atmospheres . in the former model ,",
    "a large depletion factor does not realize simultaneously with a small dispersion in stellar li abundances after the depletion .",
    "the depletion factor is then constrained to be small . in the latter model , a depletion of a factor of @xmath26 @xcite is predicted although it is still unclear if this mechanism can deplete li abundances of all mpss rather uniformly .",
    "nonstandard bbn , on the other hand , may be responsible for the li problem at least partially .",
    "we note that @xmath6be is produced more than @xmath6li in sbbn model with the planck baryon density .",
    "the @xmath6be nuclei are then converted to @xmath6li nuclei via recombination with electron followed by the electron capture , i.e. , @xmath6be + e@xmath27li + @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , the li problem is alleviated if some exotic processes could destroy @xmath6be .",
    "one of solutions to the li problem is an injection of nonthermal photon with energy of @xmath29 mev which can destroy @xmath6be but not deuterium ( d ) as calculated in ref .",
    "if a long - lived exotic particle radiatively decays after bbn , nonthermal photons can disintegrate background thermal nuclei , and light element abundances change @xcite .",
    "if the energy of the photon emitted at the decay is much larger than @xmath30 mev , all of light nuclei are disintegrated by nonthermal photons  @xcite . in this case , therefore , the li problem can not be solved ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the energy of emitted photon for the @xmath6be destruction is limited to a narrow range @xcite .",
    "a similar @xmath6be destruction would occur if a long - lived sterile neutrino decays into energetic electron and positron .",
    "we then study cosmological effects of this decay channel in this paper .    from the theoretical point of view of the extended minimal standard model ( msm ) of particle physics , right - handed neutrinos introduced as sterile neutrinos provide an elegant mechanism for the generation of tiny active neutrino masses ; so - called canonical seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "if their masses are so heavy ( more than @xmath31 ) , they also explain the origin of the baryon asymmetry of the universe ; so - called leptogenesis scenario @xcite .",
    "even if the sterile neutrinos have masses below electroweak ( ew ) scale , however , there exist other phenomenological effects without lacking the success of the seesaw mechanism .",
    "several possibilities have been investigated regarding a detectability of the sterile neutrinos , and the case in which sterile neutrinos are lighter than light mesons ( e.g. , pion or kaon ) has been studied especially in detail @xcite ( for recent study , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the allowed sterile neutrino masses are smaller than the pion mass @xmath32 140 mev , which are not consistent with recent results of neutrino oscillation experiments , unless one assumes that their lifetimes are longer than @xmath33 s. in addition , another constraint has been derived from a study of bbn by a comparison between theoretical and observational abundances of @xmath34he .",
