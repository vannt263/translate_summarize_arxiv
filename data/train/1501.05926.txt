    "<S> _ general considerations suggest that the cases of spin 1 or spin 2 are pertinent to the iron - based materials  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> judging from the measured total spin spectral weight  @xcite , the spin 1 case would be closer to the iron pnictides while the spin 2 case would be more appropriate for the iron chalcogenides .    </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , it is natural to propose that the normal state of fese realizes the phase whose ground state has the @xmath0 afq order accompanied by the ising - nematic order . in this picture </S>",
    "<S> , the structural transition at @xmath91 k corresponds to the concurrent ising - nematic and afq transition , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : phdtc ] . </S>",
    "<S> this picture explains why the structural phase transition is not accompanied by any static afm order . at the same time , as soon as the afq order is developed , its goldstone modes will contribute towards low - energy dipolar magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the onset of low - energy spin fluctuations observed in the nmr measurements @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . it will clearly be important to explore such spin fluctuations using inelastic neutron scattering measurements . </S>",
    "<S> a quantitative comparison between the measured and calculated spin excitation spectra would allow estimates of the coupling constants @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the goldstone modes may also be probed by magnetoresistance , and unusual features in this property have recently been reported @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the ising - nematic order is linearly coupled not only to the structural anisotropy , but also to the orbital order . </S>",
    "<S> similarly as for the iron pnictides  @xcite , this would result in , for instance , the lifting of the d@xmath92/d@xmath93 orbital degeneracy at the structural phase transition  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> it also makes it natural to understand the development of magnetic order that seems to occur when fese is placed under a pressure on the order of @xmath95 gpa  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that our results will serve as the basis to shed new light on the nematic correlations in the superconducting state @xcite .    _ broader context .  _ </S>",
    "<S> it is widely believed that understanding the magnetism in the iron chalcogenide fete , where the ordering wavvector @xmath94 has no connection with any fermi - surface - nesting features  @xcite , requires a local - moment picture . </S>",
    "<S> the proposal advanced here not only provides an understanding of the emerging puzzle on the magnetism in fese , but also achieves a level of commonality in the underlying microscopic interactions across these iron chalcogenides . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the connection between the afq order and the @xmath0 afm order suggests that the local - moment physics , augmented by a coupling to the coherent itinerant fermions near the fermi energy , places the magnetism of a wide range of iron - based superconductors in a unified framework . </S>",
    "<S> since local - moment physics in bad metals reflects a proximity to correlation - induced electron localization , this unified perspective also signifies the importance of electron correlations @xcite to the iron - based superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions .  </S>",
    "<S> _ to summarize , we have studied a generalized heisenberg model with frustrated bilinear - biquadratic interactions on a square lattice and find that the zero - temperature phase diagram stabilizes an antiferroquadrupolar order . </S>",
    "<S> the anisotropic spin quadrupolar fluctuations give rise to a finite - temperature ising - nematic transition . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the structural phase transition in fese corresponds to this ising - nematic transition and is accompanied by an antiferroquadrupolar ordering . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that inelastic neutron scattering experiments be carried out to explore the proposed goldstone modes associated with the antiferroquadrupolar order . </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a natural understanding for an emerging puzzle on fese . </S>",
    "<S> more generally , the extended phase diagrams advanced here considerably broaden the perspective on the magnetism and electron correlations of the iron - based superconductors .    _ note added .  _ </S>",
    "<S> recently , a study appeared that also emphasized the local - moment - based magnetic physics for fese , but invoked a different mechanism based on a possible paramagnetic ising - nematic ground state caused by @xmath96-@xmath84 frustration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a distinction of the mechanism advanced here is that the afq order yields goldstone modes and therefore causes the onset of low - energy dipolar magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , results from inelastic neutron scattering experiments in fese have appeared  @xcite , which verify the @xmath0 magnetic excitations expected from our theoretical proposal .    </S>",
