    "the nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung ( @xmath11 ) reaction has long been considered as a tool to investigate the off - shell behaviour of the @xmath1 interaction . with the availability of new experimental data of @xmath12 reaction @xcite , theoretical interest has been revived recently @xcite . as a start , it is sufficient to consider only the one - nucleon current to investigate this reaction since the leading interaction current due to one - pion - exchange vanishes identically in the @xmath13 reaction . in a calculation taking into account the relativistic features of the one - nucleon current@xcite , the sensitivity of the the @xmath3 spin observables to the @xmath1 off - shell dynamics was demonstrated .",
    "although the calculated analyzing powers are in general in good agreement with the data , the cross - section results are more controversial . in ref .",
    "@xcite a normalization factor of 2/3 was proposed to account for the discrepancy with the data . however",
    ", this discrepancy might also indicate the importance of new mechanisms not included in the calculations , thus omitting the need of this rather arbitrary normalization factor . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have explored qualitatively the mechanisms due to the @xmath0 degree of freedom .",
    "the main objective of this work is to present a consistent approach to quantify our investigation .",
    "this is accomplished by extending the coupled - channel formulation of @xmath1 scattering developed by lee and matsuyama @xcite to include the electromagnetic interactions introduced by de jong et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the effect of the @xmath0 excitation on @xmath11 has been investigated in the past using very crude models .",
    "bohannon , heller and thompson @xcite derived the one - pion - exchange @xmath0 current by taking the static nucleon limit of the pion photoproduction amplitude .",
    "the @xmath0 width was neglected and hence their model is limited to low energies .",
    "they found that the @xmath0 effect is negligibly small in @xmath14 bremsstrahlung .",
    "no calculation of @xmath15 bremsstrahlung based on their @xmath0 current has been reported .",
    "in contrast to the @xmath16 process , where the effect of the @xmath0-isobar is greatly reduced by cancellations between the different diagrams involved due to iso - spin factors , the @xmath0-effects may be significant in @xmath13 reactions .",
    "tiator et al .",
    "@xcite evaluate the contributions of the radiative @xmath0-decay in born - approximation and add these incoherently to the nucleonic contributions which were calculated using the soft photon approximation ( spa ) .",
    "although szyjewicz and kamal @xcite evaluated all one - pion - exchange @xmath0 contributions and add them coherently , their @xmath17 calculation was carried out using only the born approximation . in our previous work @xcite , we added the single - scattering @xmath0-decay diagrams coherently to a state of the art calculation of the nucleonic current contribution and found a significant effect .",
    "in the present paper we go beyond this in two respects .",
    "firstly , we use off - shell t - matrix elements that are generated from a meson - exchange coupled @xmath18 model which is constrained by the @xmath1 scattering up to 1 gev .",
    "the quality of the phase - shift fit of this t - matrix is superior to the fit of the t - matrix used in ref .",
    "secondly , we also include the rescattering diagrams induced by the presence of @xmath0 degrees of freedom .",
    "we follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to account for the relativistic features of the @xmath19 and @xmath0 currents .",
    "we will show that , even at energies below the pion threshold , the influence of the @xmath0 on the @xmath17 reaction is considerable and can not be neglected in a quantitative comparison with the data .",
    "in addition to giving a more complete description of @xmath11 reaction at low energies , our approach is appropriate for making predictions in the intermediate energy region where the pion production through the @xmath0 excitation becomes crucial . a good understanding of the @xmath11 reaction at intermediate energies is needed to describe the production of hard - photons in intermediate energy heavy - ion collisions @xcite . in these complicated processes the photon provides a clean probe of the reaction dynamics .",
    "furthermore , recent studies of dilepton production in proton - nucleus collisions have shown that virtual @xmath1 bremsstrahlung and @xmath0-decay are the dominant reaction mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the model presented in this paper can be used as the starting point of a microscopic approach to investigate both the photon and @xmath0 productions in relativistic heavy - ion collisions .    in section",
    "ii , a coupled - channel formulation for @xmath11 reaction will be presented .",
    "the results are presented in section iii .",
    "section iv is devoted to discussions of future developments .",
    "to investigate the effect of the @xmath0 on the @xmath11 reaction , it is more transparent to employ a formulation including the @xmath0 degree of freedom explicitly . in the first part of this section , we will describe such an approach based on an extension of the hamiltonian model developed by lee and matsuyama @xcite to include the electromagnetic couplings introduced by de jong et al.@xcite .",
    "we then describe how the procedures introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite are used to include the `` minimum relativity '' in the @xmath11 calculation .    the objective of the formulation of refs .",
    "@xcite was to obtain a consistent description of @xmath1 scattering from the low energy region ( @xmath20 mev ) to the intermediate energy region where the pion production through the @xmath0 excitation becomes important .",
    "in contrast with the other @xmath21 models @xcite , the formulation of refs .  @xcite was designed to have a smooth transition to the usual nonrelativistic potential model of @xmath1 interaction .",
    "this was achieved by using a substraction procedure to define the @xmath1 potential in the coupled @xmath22 space from a chosen @xmath1 potential which fits the low energy @xmath1 data .",
    "the resulting model not only maintains the good fit to the low energy @xmath1 phase shifts , but can also describe the @xmath1 data up to about 1 gev .",
    "starting with such a coupled - channel model will make the present study significantly different from all of the previous studies of the @xmath0 effect on the @xmath11 reaction . in particular",
    ", we will be able to make realistic predictions in the intermediate energy region where extensive data will soon become available at cosy , the proton - cooler ring at the forschungszentrum juelich ( germany ) .    in the formulation of refs .",
    "@xcite , it is assumed that the hamiltonian for @xmath1 scattering can be written in terms of three degrees of freedom : @xmath19 , @xmath23 , and @xmath0 . in this work",
    ", we further assume that the @xmath11 reaction can be described by adding to this hamiltonian the electromagnetic interaction @xmath24 introduced in ref .",
    "the model hamiltonian then takes the form @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sum of relativistic free energy operators , e.g. @xmath27 for the @xmath28 , @xmath0 and @xmath23 degrees of freedom .",
    "we will neglect the nonresonant pionic interactions ( @xmath29 of eq.(1.2 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) which are found in ref .  @xcite to be unimportant in describing @xmath1 scattering .",
    "the @xmath30 direct interaction is also neglected in refs .",
    "@xcite for simplicity .",
    "the considered hadronic interaction is then of the following form @xmath31 \\nonumber \\\\          & + & \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i , j=1}^{2}[v_{nn , nn}(i , j ) + v_{nn , n\\delta}(i , j ) +          v_{n\\delta , nn}(i , j)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the derivation of the @xmath1 scattering equation from the hadronic hamiltonian @xmath32 can be found in in ref .",

    "as discussed in section ii , there are other forms of the @xmath0 self - energy found in the literature .",
    "all are constrained by fitting the @xmath44 phase - shifts in the @xmath45 channel , but results from different formulations of @xmath44 scattering . to show how the form of the @xmath0 self - energy ( in casu the @xmath0 propagator ) affects the results , we show in fig .",

    "the same t - matrices based on the paris potential including @xmath0 intermediate states were used .",
    "although both propagators fit the @xmath45 phase - shift , the rather large difference between the results show the need to use a consistent @xmath0 propagator .",

    "the contribution of the @xmath0-rescattering to the cross - section is about one half of the single - scattering mechanism . at higher energies the rescattering diagrams are less significant .",
    "we have found that the largest @xmath0 effect is due to the rescattering diagram where the @xmath0 is a spectator ( the rightmost diagram in fig .",

    "the calculation of this mechanism involves an integration over two half - off - shell @xmath164 matrices and hence is most sensitive to the short - range behaviour of the transition potential @xmath46 potential used in solving the coupled equations eqs .",

    "since there are still some uncertainties in determining from the pion photoproduction reaction the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the @xmath2 vertex , we performed calculations for two sets of coupling constants .",
    "the dashed curves are calculated from using the highest value of @xmath92 ( gev@xmath89 ) and @xmath93 ( gev@xmath91 ) as determined by jones and scadron @xcite . as for their application in @xmath13 calculations",

    "we find a small decrease in the cross - section for photon energies smaller than 80 mev and a minor increase at higher photon energies .",
    "although the cross sections are clearly dominated by the nucleonic contribution , the @xmath0 effect is still significant in influencing the exclusive cross sections as displayed in figs .",
    "[ xsc_280 ] and [ ay_280 ] . at higher laboratory energies",
    "we clearly see the @xmath136-dependence of the @xmath0-decay contributions , resulting in peaks at the high end of the kinematically allowed photon energies .",
    "the cross - section near the @xmath0 peak is doubled by the @xmath0 mechanisms at @xmath5 mev , and by a factor of about 5 at @xmath172 mev .",
    "the large enhancement of the @xmath0 peak is mainly due to the resonant behavior of the @xmath0 propagator eq .",
    "( [ full_prop_del ] ) and the dependence on the photon momentum of the vertex eqs .",
    "( [ vertex_1],[vertex_2 ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to the results at @xmath156 where the effect is due to strong interference of a small @xmath0-contribution with the much larger nucleonic current contribution .    in the figure for @xmath173",
    "mev we also plot the cumulative contributions of the partial waves for @xmath174 to @xmath175 .",

    "the calculations are identical to that of figs .",

    "the dotted curves are from calculations including only the nucleonic contributions .",
    "the solid and dashed curves are respectively calculated by using the @xmath2 coupling constants of vector dominance and jones and scadron @xcite . as seen in both figs .",
    "[ 550 ] and [ 800 ] , including the @xmath0 contributions drastically changes the differential cross sections .",
    "hopefully , the forthcoming cosy experiment will have enough accuracy to distinguish the solid and dotted curves .",
    "this will help narrow down the values of @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the @xmath2 vertex .",
    "rather surprisingly , the inclusion of the @xmath0-decay diagrams has much less effects on the calculated analyzing powers .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath0-decay diagrams have at these energies and kinematics a similar spin - structure ( to the extent this is measured by the analyzing power ) as the nucleonic contributions .    finally , in regard to @xmath13 experiments at high energies we should mention the efforts of ref .",
    "these authors performed a @xmath13 experiment at @xmath180 .",

    "however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ inclusive ] , the @xmath0 effect reaches its maximum at much larger photon energies . together with the large errors this makes the experiment unsuitable for discriminating between the various sets of @xmath97 coupling constants .",

    "[ xsc_280 ] and [ ay_280 ] , the @xmath0 contribution can significantly improve the agreement with the data even at low energies below pion production threshold .",
    "given the uncertainty in the normalization of the data , it remains to be seen if the remaining discrepancies with the data are due to these normalization problems or that higher order interaction currents such as those due to the @xmath181 and @xmath182 couplings can account for these discrepancies .",
    "a qualitative study of these effects in conjuction with the @xmath0 effect can be found in ref .",

    "however , the employed coupled - channel model was constructed by fitting the @xmath1 phase shift data back in 1981 @xcite .",
    "this has to be improved since the phase shift data have been changed significantly recently @xcite . another important step is to extend the present approach to study @xmath14 bremsstralung at intermediate energies .",
