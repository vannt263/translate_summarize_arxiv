    "generalized langevin equations ( gle ) @xcite and non - markovian master equations@xcite , which arise in the treatment of systems interacting with environmental degrees of freedom , often have an integro - differential form . unlike ordinary differential equations which can be readily solved using runge - kutta , predictor - corrector and other well known numerical schemes@xcite",
    "there are no general methods for solving equations of integro - differential type . here",
    "we show that these integro - differential equations can be converted to ordinary - differential equations at the expense of introducing a new time variable which is treated as if it is of spatial type .",
    "[ similar schemes are employed to numerically solve the schrdinger equation for time - dependent hamiltonians@xcite and as analytical tools@xcite .",
    "there is also some resemblence to schemes for solving intego - differential equations of viscoelasticity@xcite . ]",
    "we then develop a numerical method based on this exact transformation and show that it can be used to accurately solve a variety of physically motivated examples .",
    "neglecting inhomogeneous terms resulting from noise , for simplicity , the generalized langevin equations@xcite for position @xmath0 and momentum @xmath1 of a damped oscillator in one dimension can be expressed in the form @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass and frequency of the oscillator and @xmath5 is the memory function . defining a space - like time variable @xmath6 and a function @xmath7 it can be verified by direct substitution that @xmath1 and @xmath8 satisfy the following ordinary differential equations @xmath9 here we have introduced a differentiable damping function @xmath10 ( with @xmath11 ) which plays a useful role in the numerical scheme we will introduce to solve the ordinary differential equations ( [ gle1 ] ) , ( [ gle3 ] ) and ( [ gle4 ] ) . [ note that @xmath12 . ]    neglecting inhomogeneous terms , non - markovian master equations@xcite can be written in the form @xmath13-\\int_{-\\infty}^tk(t , t')\\rho(t')~dt ' \\label{mastera}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the time - evolving reduced density matrix of the subsystem , @xmath15 is an effective hamiltonian , and @xmath16 is a memory operator .",
    "[ we employ units such that @xmath17 . ]",
    "defining an operator @xmath18 it can be verified by direct substitution that @xmath14 and @xmath8 satisfy ordinary differential equations @xmath19-\\chi(t,0)\\label{master1}\\\\ d\\chi(t , u)/dt&=&f(u)k(t+u , t)\\rho(t)+\\frac{\\partial \\chi(t , u)}{\\partial u}\\nonumber \\\\ & -&\\frac{f'(u)}{f(u)}~\\chi(t , u).\\label{master2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is again a differentiable damping function such that @xmath11 .",
    "thus , the integro - differential langevin equations ( [ gle1])-([gle2 ] ) can be expressed in the ordinary differential forms ( [ gle1 ] ) and ( [ gle3])-([gle4 ] ) and the integro - differential master equation ( [ mastera ] ) can be expressed as the ordinary differential equations ( [ master1])-([master2 ] ) . to exploit these transformed equations as a practical numerical scheme we must discretize the @xmath6 variable on a grid of points so that the number of ordinary differential equations is finite . once this is achieved",
    "the ordinary differential equations can be solved using standard techniques@xcite .",
    "we use an eighth order runge - kutta routine@xcite in our calculations .    to minimize the number of grid points we choose a damping function @xmath10 which decreases rapidly with @xmath6 . in the calculations reported here we used @xmath20 . in practice",
    "fewer grid points are needed for positive @xmath6 than for negative @xmath6 , and we found that the points @xmath21 for @xmath22 worked well when we chose @xmath23 . here @xmath24 is the largest positive @xmath6 value . while accurate solutions can be obtained for almost any non - zero value of @xmath25 we found the most rapid convergence when values were optimized for the type of equation .",
    "hence , @xmath25 is specified differently below for each type of equation . to complete the numerical method",
    "we need a representation of the partial derivative with respect to @xmath6 on the grid .",
    "this could be performed via fast fourier transform techniques@xcite .",
    "we chose instead to employ a matrix representation @xmath26 which is known as the sinc - dvr ( discrete variable representation)@xcite . a discrete variable representation ( dvr )",
    "is a complete set of basis functions , associated with a specific grid of points , in which functions of the variable are diagonal and derivatives have simple matrix representations@xcite .",
    "dvrs are often used in multi - dimensional quantum mechanical scattering theory calculations@xcite . in the sinc - dvr@xcite , which is associated with an equidistantly",
    "spaced grid on @xmath27 , partial derivatives can thus be evaluated with a sum @xmath28 for any function or operator @xmath29 . in our calculations we chose @xmath30 to equal the time interval @xmath31 between output from the runge - kutta routine .      for the generalized langevin equation we chose an initial value problem ( i.e. @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 ) where @xmath36 has one of the following forms @xmath37 which are displayed graphically in figure 1 .",
    "the solid curve is ( [ mem1 ] ) , the dashed is ( [ mem2 ] ) , the short - dashed is ( [ mem3 ] ) and the dotted is ( [ mem4 ] ) .",
    "these memory functions were chosen to roughly represent the various functional forms which can occur physically@xcite and for ease in obtaining exact solutions .",
    "the constants appearing in equations ( [ gle1 ] ) , ( [ gle3 ] ) and ( [ gle4 ] ) are chosen as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "figure 2 shows the functional form of the exact solutions @xmath0 ( solid curve ) and @xmath1 ( dashed ) , which evolve from initial conditions @xmath40 and @xmath41 , for memory function ( [ mem1 ] ) over a timescale of 20 units with @xmath42 .",
    "solutions for the other memory functions ( and the same initial conditions ) are similar in appearance .",
    "these exact solutions were obtained by expoiting the fact that the above memory functions are sums of exponentials ( i.e. @xmath43 ) from which it follows that one may write @xmath44 for @xmath45 , and solve these ordinary differential equations using standard methods .",
    "this approach only works for memory functions of this type .",
    "the negative logarithm of the absolute error in @xmath0 , @xmath48 is shown in figure 3 plotted against time for the values of @xmath49 indicated in the inset .",
    "[ the error in @xmath1 is similar . ] as @xmath49 increases @xmath50 increases ( on average ) and hence the error decreases .",
    "the oscillations in @xmath50 are caused by periodic intersections of the two solutions . in practice",
    "it is impossible to visually distinguish the two solutions when @xmath51 .",
    "note that after a short transient the error ( on average ) does not increase .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the linearity of these equations .",
    "some decline in accuracy with time should be expected when the langevin equations are non - linear ( e.g. a particle in a double - well ) .",
    "figure 4 compares the exact solutions for @xmath0 ( solid curve ) and @xmath1 ( short - dashed ) with those obtained using our method for @xmath52 ( dashed and dotted , respectively ) over a time of 40 units .",
    "no disagreement is visible .",
    "convergence for memory function ( [ mem2 ] ) is similar .",
    "memory functions ( [ mem3 ] ) and ( [ mem4 ] ) which take negative values and have long time tails require many grid points for convergence .",
    "figure 5 shows the negative logarithm ( base ten ) of the absolute error in @xmath0 for this case .",
    "while many grid points are required , high accuracy solutions can clearly be obtained using our method .    for the master equation we chose an initial value problem consisting of a dissipative two - level system representing a spin interacting with environmental degrees of freedom .",
    "if the spin hamiltonian is @xmath53 and the coupling to the environment is proportional to @xmath54 then the equation for the density matrix @xmath14 is of the form@xcite @xmath55\\nonumber \\\\ & & -c\\int_0^t w(t - t')\\{\\sigma_x^2\\rho(t')+\\rho(t')\\sigma_x^2 - 2\\sigma_x\\rho(t')\\sigma_x\\}~dt'\\nonumber\\\\ & & ~~~~\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the sigmas denote pauli matrices .",
    "parameters were set as @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "we chose to define @xmath58 which differs somewhat from the general definition employed in ( [ smo ] ) .",

    "however , we were unable to obtain an exact solution of the master equation for this case@xcite",
    ". instead we approximate the gaussian via the similar function @xmath60 .",
    "exact solutions for @xmath61 and initial conditions @xmath62 and @xmath63 were obtained in the same way as for the generalized langevin equations and are plotted vs time in figure 6 .    for the approximate method we used @xmath64",

    "we see that convergence of the numerical method is very rapid for these equations .",
    "[ similar accuracies are achieved for @xmath66 and @xmath67 . ]",
    "thus , we have shown that accurate solutions of integro - differential equations can be obtained via transformation to a larger set of ordinary differential equations . because this transformation is exact",
    "we expect that the method will also work for equations not considered in this manuscript .",
    "it should be possible to obtain accurate solutions for such equations via the following steps .",
    "first find an approximation of the memory function or operator which will allow exact solutions to be obtained .",
