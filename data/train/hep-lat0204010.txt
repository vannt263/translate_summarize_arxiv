    "the study of the phase structure of qcd at non - zero temperature and baryon density is one of the most interesting topics in contemporary physics .",
    "heavy - ion collision experiments are running at bnl and cern with the goal of the experimental production of a new state of matter , the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . on the theoretical side",
    ", novel color superconducting and superfluid phases have been conjectured at high baryon densities @xcite . for these reasons",
    "the need for numerical studies of the qcd phase transition using lattice gauge theory simulations , currently the most powerful quantitative approach to qcd , with both temperature @xmath7 and quark chemical potential @xmath8 , is more urgent than ever .",
    "precise theoretical inputs from simulations in the vicinity of the qcd phase transition are indispensable to the understanding of the heavy - ion collision experiments .    over the last several years , the numerical study of lattice qcd has been successful at zero chemical potential and high temperature@xcite . in contrast , because the quark determinant is complex at @xmath9 and monte - carlo simulation not directly applicable , studies at non - zero @xmath0 are still largely exploratory .",
    "recent developments with @xmath6 can be classified in two categories @xcite . at the low temperatures and high densities where",
    "the new phases are expected , studies of model field theories such as two - color ( su(2 ) ) qcd and the njl model have been made .",
    "the simulation is possible because in both cases the quark determinant is positive definite so that conventional monte carlo methods can be used .",
    "the other case is high temperature and low density , which is phenomenologically more important for rhic , since the qcd phase transition both in the early universe and in the interesting regime for heavy - ion collisions is expected at rather low density , e.g. , @xmath10 @xmath11 for rhic @xcite . in this region",
    "the reweighting method , in which observables at @xmath6 are computed by performing simulations at @xmath12 , is applicable @xcite . using this method ,",
    "the first results on the phase structure in the @xmath13 plane were recently obtained by fodor and katz @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , although in principle with infinite statistics this method is exact , rather general arguments suggest that in practise the region of applicability of the reweighting method becomes narrower as the lattice volume is increased . another efficient method at low density is via a taylor expansion obtained by computing the derivatives of physical quantities with respect to @xmath0 at @xmath1 .",
    "this approach is not restricted to small lattices , because it requires only the expectation values of local fermion bilinears ; these are measured effectively on large systems using stochastic methods , and might even be expected to self - average as the volume increases .",
    "since analyticity is required , however , the values of @xmath0 which can be reached must be bounded by , e.g. the critical point expected in the @xmath13 plane for qcd with 2 light flavors .",
    "pioneering work in such a framework have been made by developing expansions for free energy , yielding quark number susceptibility  @xcite , for hadronic screening masses@xcite and in the context of the 3-dimensional effective theory@xcite .    in this study , we investigate the transition temperature @xmath14 as a function of @xmath6 . in sec .",
    "[ sec : method ] , we propose a new method to compute derivatives of physical quantities with respect to @xmath15 details of our simulations performed on a @xmath3 lattice with quark masses @xmath16 are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mass ] we check the feasibility of the method by calculating the derivative of the transition point with respect to @xmath17 . our main result , the calculation of the second derivative of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath0 for 2 flavor qcd , is given in sec .",
    "[ sec : mu ] . using data on the lattice beta - function , we are then able to translate this result into physical units , yielding an estimate for the phase transition line @xmath5 .",
    "we also discuss the response of the pressure @xmath19 and energy density @xmath20 to non - zero @xmath0 , and estimate their variation along the critical line .",
    "finally in this section we discuss the problem of the complex phase of the quark determinant , and show that the sign problem is mild in the region of the phase diagram relevant for rhic physics .",
    "section [ sec : summary ] presents our conclusions .",
    "ferrenberg and swendsen s reweighting method is a very useful technique to investigate critical phenomena @xcite . in qcd the expectation value of an observable @xmath21 can in principle",
    "be computed by simulation at @xmath22 using the following identity : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the quark matrix , @xmath25 the gauge action , @xmath26 the number of flavors , and @xmath27 or @xmath28 for wilson or staggered lattice fermions respectively . the chemical potential parameter @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the lattice spacing .",
    "because @xmath31 is complex for re@xmath32 , the expectation values in ( [ eq : opexp ] ) can only be estimated by conventional monte carlo importance sampling if the simulation is performed for @xmath33 zero or pure imaginary .",
    "most of the attempts to calculate at @xmath6 have used variants of this method @xcite .",
    "the reweighting factor for the gauge part is easy to compute by measuring the plaquette @xmath34 , since @xmath35 for the standard wilson action , and extensions for improved actions are easy to derive .",
    "however , to compute the fermion part , the calculation of the fermion determinant is required for each point @xmath36 we want to study .",
    "such a calculation is quite expensive and difficult to perform in practice .",
    "fodor and katz have performed such calculations , and by reweighting in both @xmath0 and @xmath37 have succeeded in tracing out the critical line @xmath38 and locating the critical endpoint on small lattices @xcite .",
    "their method exploits the fact that the overlap between ensembles at different points along the coexistence line separating hadronic and quark - gluon plasma phases remains reasonably large on finite systems .",
    "another problem of the reweighting method is the sign problem , which will be discussed in detail later .",
    "as @xmath0 increases from zero , the calculation of eqn.([eq : opexp ] ) becomes more difficult due to fluctuations in the phase of the denominator . to avoid these problems ,",
    "we restrict ourselves to calculating derivatives of physical quantities with respect to @xmath0 , which can be done at @xmath1 .",
    "this yields estimates of the physical quantity as a continuous function of @xmath0 in a narrow range of @xmath0 , but the region of applicability is not restricted to the immediate neighbourhood of the phase transition .",
    "this permits the development of a taylor expansion of observables in powers of @xmath29 ; strictly speaking , in fact , the physically relevant expansion parameter which ultimately must govern convergence is the fugacity @xmath39 . the taylor expansion for the fermionic part of the reweighting factor around @xmath1",
    "is @xmath40 we similarly expand fermionic observables such as the chiral condensate , @xmath41 where the lattice size is @xmath42 , once again obtaining a continuous function for small @xmath0 . using the formula @xmath43 expressions for @xmath44 and @xmath45 in terms of traces over products of local operators and inverse matrices",
    "can be developed : @xmath46 @xmath47    we apply the random noise method to calculate the derivatives of @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which enables us to compute on rather large volumes in comparison with usual studies of qcd with @xmath6 . using @xmath50 sets of random noise vectors @xmath51 which satisfy the condition : @xmath52 we rewrite the trace of products of @xmath53 and @xmath54 as @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57",
    "are obtained by solving @xmath58 or @xmath59 , and we compute the rhs of eqn.([eq : noise ] ) with finite @xmath50 .",
    "the error for estimates of physical observables made from @xmath60 configurations is expected to decrease as @xmath61 .",
    "further notes on the application of the noise method are given in the appendix .    by using the derivatives of both the reweighting factor and fermionic observable up to @xmath62-th order in @xmath0",
    ", we can obtain the correct answer for the expectation value up to @xmath62-th order , which can be easily checked by performing a taylor expansion of the expectation value , eqn.([eq : rew ] ) , directly for each physical observable .",
    "of course , for a pure gluonic observable such as the polyakov loop @xmath63 only the expansion of @xmath64 is needed .",
    "furthermore , we should note that at @xmath1 the odd order derivatives of both @xmath48 and @xmath49 are pure imaginary and the even order derivatives are real .",
    "this property is proved using the identities for the fermion matrix : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is @xmath67 for wilson fermions and @xmath68 for staggered .",
    "then , at @xmath1 @xmath69 because the terms in the @xmath62-th derivative satisfy @xmath70 , we obtain @xmath71 using this property and the fact that @xmath72 is a real function of @xmath37 , @xmath17 and @xmath0 , we can explicitly confirm that , if the operator has the property such that even order derivatives are real and odd order derivatives are pure imaginary at @xmath1 , e.g. , @xmath73 or its susceptibility , then all odd order derivatives of the expectation value of a physical quantity are zero at @xmath1 , as we expect from the symmetry under changing @xmath0 to @xmath74 .",
    "the derivative of the expectation value can be written as a sum of products of expectation values composed of the operator , the reweighting factor and their derivatives , and the total number of differentiations in each term has to be odd for an odd order derivative .",
    "hence all terms for odd derivatives contain at least one expectation value of a pure imaginary operator and hence vanish , since the expectation value of a pure imaginary operator is zero .",
    "therefore the first non - trivial order of corrections to e.g. @xmath75 or its susceptbility , which we compute in this study is @xmath76 ; the truncation errors , so far unquantified , are @xmath77 .    in order to be more specific ,",
    "let us define the taylor expansion of an operator by @xmath78 . then to @xmath76 the expression ( [ eq : opexp ] ) for @xmath79",
    "can be rewritten @xmath80 where expectation values on the rhs are measured with respect to an ensemble generated at @xmath81 .",
    "extension of this formula to combining data from several ensembles using multi - histogramming is straightforward @xcite .",
    "further details on the evaluation of ( [ eq : specific ] ) using the noise method for fermionic operators are given in the appendix .    in order to determine the pseudocritical point",
    ", we calculate the polyakov loop susceptibility , @xmath82 where the polyakov loop @xmath83 , and the susceptibility of the chiral condensate , @xmath84 we define the transition point @xmath38 by the peak position of these susceptibilities for each @xmath0 ; @xmath85 if we compute @xmath86 correctly up to @xmath62-th order in @xmath0 , we can determine the @xmath62-th derivative of @xmath18 with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "for example if we determine @xmath38 using an operator such as @xmath75 , which is real and whose first derivative at mu=0 is pure imaginary , then the first derivative @xmath87 vanishes because as argued above the first derivative of the susceptibility is zero in this case .",
    "finally , note we can also estimate the magnitude of fluctuations of the phase of @xmath88 , because on each configuration this phase can be expressed in terms of the odd terms of the taylor expansion of @xmath48 ; this will be discussed in more detail in section [ sec : phase ] .",
    "we employ a combination of the symanzik improved gauge and 2 flavors of the p4-improved staggered fermion actions @xcite .",

    "this tendency is also supported by the result of fodor and katz @xcite , and hints at contributions from higher - order derivatives , or even non - analytic behaviour , at larger values of @xmath0 . despite the large errors we can see that our result gives us useful information about the phase diagram , at least for small @xmath0 , because the first derivative is zero .",
    "another point worth noting is the screening effect of dynamical anti - quarks at @xmath181 .",
    "negative chemical potential induces the dynamical generation of anti - quarks , which in contrast to quarks can completely screen an external color triplet current .",

    "<S> derivatives of quark and gluonic observables with respect to @xmath0 are computed at @xmath1 for 2 flavors of p-4 improved staggered fermions with @xmath2 on a @xmath3 lattice , and used to calculate the leading order taylor expansion in @xmath0 of the location of the pseudocritical point about @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this expansion should be well - behaved for the small values of @xmath4 relevant for rhic phenomenology , and predicts a critical curve @xmath5 in reasonable agreement with estimates obtained using exact reweighting . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we contrast the case of isoscalar and isovector chemical potentials , quantify the effect of @xmath6 on the equation of state , and comment on the complex phase of the fermion determinant in qcd with @xmath6 . </S>"
