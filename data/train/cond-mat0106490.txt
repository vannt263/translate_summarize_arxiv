    "the field of first - principles alloy theory has made substantial progress over the last two decades .",
    "it is now possible to predict relatively complex solid - state phase diagrams starting from the basic principles of quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics .",
    "since no experimental input is required , these _ ab - initio _ calculations have been useful for clarifying the phase diagram of several new materials @xcite .",
    "several excellent reviews on the topic exist @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of calculated phase diagrams is currently limited by two factors .",
    "first , one needs , as a starting point , the energy of the alloy in various atomic configurations and hence , one is limited by the accuracy of the quantum - mechanical calculations used to obtain these energies . typically , methods based on density functional theory ( dft ) , such as the local density approximation ( lda ) or the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) are used .",
    "a second shortcoming arises from the fact that , in order to reduce computational requirements , the sampling of the partition function to obtain the free energy is only done over a limited number of degrees of freedom .",
    "typically , these include substitutional interchanges of atoms but no atomic vibrations .",
    "attempts to either assess the validity of this approximation or to devise computationally efficient ways to account for lattice vibrations are currently the focus of intense research .",
    "this interest is fueled by the observation that phase diagrams obtained from first principles often incorrectly predict transition temperatures .",
    "it is hoped that lattice vibrations could account for some of the remaining discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements .",
    "three main questions are addressed in this paper .    1 .",
    "do lattice vibrations have a sufficiently important impact on phase stability that their thermodynamic effects need to be included in phase diagram calculations ? 2 .",
    "what are the fundamental mechanisms that explain the relationship between the structure of a phase and its vibrational properties ? 3",
    ".   how can the effect of lattice vibrations be modeled at a reasonable computational cost ?    this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , section [ generalities ] presents the basic formalism that allows the calculation of phase diagrams , along with the generalization needed to account for lattice vibrations . a review of the theoretical and experimental literature seeking to quantify the impact of lattice vibrations on phase stability is then presented in section [ evidence ] .",
    "the main mechanisms through which lattice vibrations influences phase stability are described in section [ secmecha ] .",
    "section [ compute ]  describes the methods used to calculate vibrational properties while section [ experimental ] presents the experimental techniques allowing their measurement .",
    "finally , section [ modellatvib ] discusses the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of models of lattice vibrations .",
    "phase stability at constant temperature is determined by the free energy should be used instead of the helmoltz free energy @xmath3 , but at atmospheric pressure , the @xmath4 term is negligible for an alloy . ]",
    "the free energy can be expressed as a sum of a configurational contribution @xmath5 and vibrational contributions @xmath6 .",
    "the configurational contribution accounts for the fact that atoms can jump from one lattice site to another , while vibrational contribution accounts for the vibrations of each atom around its equilibrium position .",
    "the first part of this section presents the traditional formalism used in alloy theory to determine the configurational contribution .",
    "the second part introduces the basic quantities that determine whether lattice vibrations have a significant effect on phase stability .",
    "the third part describes how the traditional formalism can be adapted when lattice vibrations do need to be accounted for .",
    "one of the goals of alloy theory is to determine the relative stability of phases characterized by a distinct ordering of atomic species on a given periodic array of sites .",
    "this array of sites , called the _ parent lattice _ , can be any crystallographic lattice augmented by any motif .",
    "a convenient representation of an alloy system is the ising model . in the common case of a binary alloy system ,",
    "the ising model consists of assigning a spin - like occupation variable @xmath7 to each site @xmath8 of the parent lattice , which takes the value @xmath9 or @xmath10 depending on the type of atom occupying the site",
    ". a particular arrangement of spins of the parent lattice is called a _ configuration _ and can be represented by a vector @xmath11 containing the value of the occupation variable for each site in the parent lattice .",
    "although this framework can be extended to arbitrary multicomponent alloys @xcite , we focus on the case of binary alloys , since all the studies we review consider binary alloys only .    when all the fluctuations in energy are assumed to arise solely from configurational change , the ising model is a natural way to represent an alloy .",
    "the thermodynamics of the system can then be summarized in a partition function of the form :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the energy when the alloy has configuration @xmath11",
    ". it would be computationally intractable to compute the energy of every configuration from first - principles .",
    "fortunately , the configurational dependence of the energy can be parametrized in a compact form with the help of the so - called cluster expansion @xcite .",
    "the cluster expansion is a generalization of the well - known ising hamiltonian .",
    "the energy ( per atom ) is represented as a polynomial in the occupation variables : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a cluster ( a set of sites @xmath8 ) .",
    "the sum is taken over all clusters @xmath16 that are not equivalent by a symmetry operation of the space group of the parent lattice , while the average is taken over all clusters @xmath17 that are equivalent to @xmath16 by symmetry .",
    "the coefficients @xmath18 in this expansion embody the information regarding the energetics of the alloy and are called the effective cluster interaction ( eci ) .",
    "the _ multiplicities _ @xmath19 indicate the number of clusters that are equivalent by symmetry to @xmath16 ( divided by the number of lattice sites ) .    it can be shown that when _ all _ clusters @xmath16 are considered in the sum , the cluster expansion is able to represent any function @xmath20 of configuration @xmath11 by an appropriate selection of the values of @xmath18 . however , the real advantage of the cluster expansion is that , in practice , it is found to converge rapidly",
    ". a sufficient accuracy for phase diagram calculations can be achieved by keeping only clusters @xmath16 that are relatively compact ( _ e.g. _ short - range pairs or small triplets ) .",
    "the unknown parameters of the cluster expansion ( the eci ) can then determined by fitting them to the energy of relatively small number of configurations obtained , for instance , through first - principles computations .",
    "the cluster expansion thus presents an extremely concise and practical way to model the configurational dependence of an alloy s energy .",
    "how many eci and structures are needed in practice ?",
    "a typical well - converged cluster expansion of the energy of an alloy consists of about 20 to 30 eci and necessitates the calculation of the energy of around 40 to 50 ordered structures ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "a faithful modeling of the qualitative features of the phase diagram ( correct stable phases and topology ) typically requires far fewer eci ( as little as 1 pair interaction ) and correspondingly less structures , as illustrated by the numerous examples given in @xcite . in general multicomponent systems ,",
    "the number of eci and ordered structures required to achieve a given precision unfortunately grows rapidly with the number of species ( @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , in ternaries , each pair interaction is characterized by 3 interaction parameters instead of only one in the binary case .",
    "for this reason , very few first - principle calculations of ternary phase diagrams have been attempted ( see @xcite for a recent example , or @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "although the cluster expansion usually allows a very compact representation of the energetics of an alloy system , there are two situations where a standard cluster expansion is known to converge slowly",
    ". systems where long - range elastic interactions are important due to a large atomic size mismatch between the alloyed species may require that elastic interactions be explicitly accounted for through the use of a so - called reciprocal space cluster expansion @xcite .",
    "another situation , as recently identified by @xcite , is when the electronic structure of the system exhibits a very strong configurational dependence due to symmetry - breaking effects .    in the cases",
    "where a short - range cluster expansion does provide a sufficient accuracy , the process of calculating the phase diagram of an alloy system can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the energy of the alloy in a relatively small number of configurations is calculated , for instance through first - principles computations .",
    "second , the calculated energies are used to fit the unknown coefficients of the cluster expansion ( the eci @xmath18 ) .",
    "finally , with the help of this compact representation , the energy of a large number of configurations is sampled , in order to determine the phase boundaries .",
    "this latter step can be accomplished with either the cluster variation method ( cvm ) @xcite , the low - temperature expansion ( lte ) @xcite , or monte - carlo simulations @xcite .",
    "the previous section described the framework allowing the calculation of phase diagrams under the assumption that the thermodynamics of the alloy is determined solely by configurational excitations .",
    "accounting for vibrational excitations introduces corrections to this simplified treatment .",
    "this section presents the basic quantities that enable an estimation of the magnitude of the effect of lattice vibration on alloy thermodynamics . to understand the effect of lattice vibrations on phase stability , it is instructive to decompose the configurational ( `` config '' ) and vibrational ( `` vib '' ) parts of the free energy @xmath21 of a phase @xmath16 into an energetic contribution @xmath22 and an entropic contribution @xmath23 : @xmath24 we take the convention that @xmath25 is the energy of the alloy system when all atoms are frozen at their average position at a given temperature . in the approximation of harmonic lattice vibrations and in the limit of high temperature , the vibrational energy @xmath26 is simply determined by the equipartition theorem and is independent of the phase @xmath16 considered . hence as long as these approximations are appropriate , lattice vibrations",
    "are mainly expected to influence phase stability through their entropic contribution @xmath27 .    intuitively , the vibrational entropy @xmath27 is a measure of the average stiffness of an alloy , as can be best illustrated by considering an simple system made of large number of identical harmonic oscillators",
    ". the softer the oscillators are , the larger their oscillation amplitude can be , for a fixed average energy per oscillator .",
    "hence , the system samples a larger number of states and the entropy of the system increases . in summary ,",
    "the softer the alloy , the larger the vibrational entropy .",
    "a phase with a large vibrational entropy is stabilized relative to other phases , since a larger vibrational entropy results in a lower free energy , as seen by equation ( [ emts ] ) . from a statistical mechanics point of view",
    ", this fact can be understood by observing that a phase that encloses more states in phase space is more likely to be visited , as the system undergoes microscopic transitions , and therefore exhibits an increased stability .",
    "the central role of vibrational entropy can be further appreciated by considering the effect of vibrations on a phase transition between two phases @xmath16 and @xmath28 which differ only by their average configuration ( _ e.g. _ an order - disorder transition ) .",
    "if the vibrational entropy difference between the two phases is @xmath29 , the transition temperature obtained with both configurational and vibrational contributions ( @xmath30 ) is related to the transition temperature obtained with configurational effects only ( @xmath31 ) by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the change in configurational entropy upon phase transformation @xcite .",
    "this result is exact in the limit of small vibrational effects , high temperature and harmonic vibrations .",
    "a correction to this result that accounts for anharmonicity can be found in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ tcshift ] ) indicates that the quantity determining the magnitude of the effect of lattice vibration on phase stability is the ratio of the vibrational entropy difference to the configurational entropy difference .",
    "for this reason , most investigations aimed at assessing the importance of lattice vibrations focus on estimating vibrational entropy differences between phases . since the configurational entropy ( per atom ) @xmath34 for a binary alloy at concentration @xmath35 is bracketed by @xmath36 equations ( [ tcshift ] ) and ( [ svibbnd ] ) provide us with a absolute scale to gauge the importance of vibrations .",
    "as we will see , typical vibrational entropy differences are of the order of @xmath1 , indicating that corrections of the order of 30% to the transition temperature may not be uncommon .    while it is clear that vibrational excitations introduce quantitative corrections to the simple picture of alloy thermodynamics based on configurational excitations only , more profound effects of a qualitative nature are also possible .",
    "vibrational effects may lead to deviations from the traditional belief that , at high enough temperature , all short - range order in a disordered material disappears @xcite . while a fully disordered state clearly maximizes configurational entropy @xmath34 ,",
    "it is not clear that the total entropy @xmath37 is necessarily maximized in the state of maximum configurational disorder .",
    "the presence of short - range order may _ increase _ the total entropy , relative to a fully disordered alloy , through an increase of the vibrational entropy .",
    "vibrational entropy somewhat challenges our intuition , which is largely derived from tacitly assuming that configurational disorder is _ all _ disorder .",
    "it is even conceivable that vibrational entropy could induce a transition from a disordered to an ordered phase with increasing temperature , if the vibrational entropy difference between the ordered and disordered phases is larger and opposite to the configurational entropy difference .",
    "while this phenomenon has , so far , not been observed in metallic alloys , presumably because of the large configurational entropy associated with disordering , it does occur in molecular systems , such as in diblock copolymer melts , where the configurational entropy ( per monomer ) is small @xcite .",
    "the cluster expansion formalism presented in section [ alloyth ] appears to focus solely on configurational excitations .",
    "this section , shows that , in fact , non - configurational sources of energy fluctuations can naturally be taken into account within the cluster expansion framework through a process called `` coarse graining '' of the partition function @xcite .",
    "this procedure also clarifies the nature of the physical states that are represented by a configuration of the ising model .",
    "all the thermodynamic information of a system is contained in its partition function : @xmath38 ,   \\label{pf_gen}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the energy of the system in state @xmath40 . in the case of a crystalline alloy system",
    ", the sum over all possible states of the system can be conveniently factored as following : @xmath41   \\label{factorize}\\ ] ] where    * @xmath42 is a so - called parent lattice : it is a set of sites where atoms can sit . in principle , the sum would be taken over any bravais lattice augmented by any motif . * @xmath11 is a configuration on the parent lattice : it specifies which type of atom sits on each lattice site . *",
    "@xmath43 denotes the displacement of each atom away from its ideal lattice site .",
    "* @xmath44 is a particular electronic state ( both the spatial wavefunction and spin state ) when the nuclei are constrained to be in a state described by @xmath43 .",
    "* @xmath45 is the energy of the alloy in a state characterized by @xmath42 , @xmath11 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "each summation is taken over the states that are included in the set of states defined by the `` coarser '' levels in the hierarchy of states .",
    "for instance , the sum over displacements @xmath43 includes all displacements such that the atoms remain close to the undistorted configuration @xmath11 on lattice @xmath42 .",
    "while equation ( [ factorize ] ) is in principle exact , practical first - principles calculations of phase diagrams typically rely on various simplifying assumptions .",
    "the sum over electronic states is often reduced to a single term , namely , the electronic ground state .",
    "the validity of this approximation can be assessed by ensuring that different structures have a similar electronic density of states in the vicinity of the fermi level . if needed , the contribution of electronic entropy is , at least in its one - electron approximation , relatively simple to include without prohibitive computational requirements @xcite .",
    "a simplifying assumption that is much more difficult to relax is the reduction of the sum over displacements @xmath43 to a single term .",
    "this simplification has been extensively used in alloy theory , because calculating the summation over @xmath43 involves intensive calculations . the particular displacement representing a given configuration @xmath11 is typically chosen to be a local minimum in energy that is close to the undistorted ideal structure where atoms lie exactly at their ideal lattice sites .",
    "usually , this state is found by placing the atoms at their ideal lattice positions and relaxing the system until a local minimum of the energy is obtained . in this fashion",
    ", the state chosen is the most probable one in the neighborhood of phase space associated with configuration @xmath11 . in this approximation",
    ", the partition function takes the form of an ising model partition function : @xmath46 with @xmath47 .",
    "it turns out that the same statistical mechanics techniques developed in the context of the ising model can also be used in the more general setting where atoms are allowed to vibrate ( and where electrons are allowed to be excited above their ground state ) .",
    "all is needed is to replace the energy @xmath48 by the _ constrained free energy _",

    "this process , called the `` coarse graining '' of the partition function , is naturally interpreted as integrating out the  fast  degrees of freedom ( _ e.g. _ vibrations ) before considering  slower ",
    "ones ( _ e.g. _ configurational changes ) @xcite .",
    "this process is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ coarsefig ] .",
    "the quantity to be represented by a cluster expansion is now the constrained free energy @xmath49 .",
    "the only minor complication is that the effective cluster interactions become temperature dependent .",
    "there is some level of arbitrariness in the precise definition of the set of displacement @xmath43 over which the summation is taken in equation [ consf ] .",
    "however , in the common case where there is a local energy minimum in the neighborhood of @xmath11 and where the system spends most of its time visiting a neighborhood that can be approximated by a harmonic potential well , the set of displacements over which the summation is taken has little effect on the calculated thermodynamic properties . under the above assumptions , calculating the partition function of a constrained harmonic system and a harmonic system that allows infinite displacements gives essentially the same result : @xmath51 & \\approx & \\sum_{v\\in { \\bf\\sigma}}\\exp \\left [ -\\beta e_{h}(l,{\\bf\\sigma},v , t)\\right ] \\\\ & \\approx & \\sum_{\\text{all } v}\\exp \\left [ -\\beta e_{h}(l,{\\bf\\sigma},v , t)\\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 $ ] and @xmath53 denotes a harmonic approximation to @xmath54 . in this framework ,",
    "all that is needed to account for lattice vibrations , is the determination of the free energy of a harmonic solid in the neighborhood of any configurations @xmath11 .",
    "( appendix [ instab ] discusses the case where the above assumptions are violated , that is , when no local minimum exists in the phase space neighborhood of @xmath11 . )",
    "the problem of calculating @xmath49 for a set of configurations @xmath11 is much more demanding than calculating the energy @xmath48 for a set of @xmath55 devising an efficient way to calculate @xmath49 is the fundamental problem that needs to be resolved in order to include vibrational effects in phase diagram calculations .      after presenting the basic framework enabling the calculation of the configurational free energy ,  this section has presented two important aspects of the thermodynamics of lattice vibrations .    1 .",

    "in light of the large computational requirements associated with the inclusion of lattice vibrations , is it important to ensure that such an endeavor is worth the effort .",
    "this section reviews the experimental and theoretical evidence that supports the view that vibrational effects are important in the context of phase diagram calculations .",
    "there exists a large literature aimed at determining the vibrational properties of solids ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . here",
    ", the focus is on investigations directly related to the determination of vibrational entropy ( or free energy ) _ differences _ between phases which differ solely by the ordering of the chemical species on an otherwise _ identical parent lattice_.    this relatively narrow choice is driven by two observations .",
    "first , while there have been numerous investigations of the absolute vibrational properties of solids , the more difficult issue that needs to be addressed in the context of phase stability is the determination of accurate _ differences _ in vibrational properties .",
    "second , it has already been established that many structural phase transformations ( _ e.g. _ , from fcc to bcc ) are driven by lattice vibrations @xcite .",
    "this fact does not pose major difficulties for the purpose of phase diagram calculations : one can easily compute the vibrational properties of a few lattice types .",
    "the real difficulty is to calculate the vibrational entropy of _ many _ configurations on _ each _ of these lattices , a task which is only needed if vibrational properties differ substantially across distinct configurations on an _ identical parent lattice_.    the presentation will be mainly chronological , although deviations from that intention will be made for the sake of clarity . we leave a more precise description of the methods used for subsequent sections , focusing here on the results obtained .",
    "the key theoretical and experimental results are summarized in tables [ tabsvibth ] and [ tabsvibexp ] , respectively .",
    "the idea that the state of order of an alloy could be coupled with its lattice dynamics is not new . during the 1960 s ,",
    "as the foundations of alloy thermodynamics were being established , the question of the effect of lattice vibrations was already being raised .",
    "studies on the order - disorder transition of @xmath28-brass @xcite , for instance , have indicated that lattice vibrations are crucial to accurately model the magnitude of the experimentally observed discontinuity in heat capacity at the phase transition , which determines the change in vibrational entropy upon disordering .",
    "after these initial investigations , increasingly accurate models for the coupling between lattice vibration and the state of order of an alloy , were then developed @xcite .",
    "these models generally involved unknown parameters that need to be estimated from available experimental thermodynamic data .",
    "a recurring theme among these studies is the idea that , for sensible choices of the stiffness of the springs connecting the atoms , the effect of lattice vibrations is likely to be important .",
    "the estimated vibrational entropies of disordering lie between @xmath56 , for the most conservative estimates @xcite , up to the order of @xmath57.@xcite .    with the increased availability of computing power ,",
    "the application of first - principles methods became a practical possibility and the unknown parameters of the theoretical models of lattice vibration have become directly computable , without relying on experimental input .",
    "initially , only simple bulk properties , such as the bulk modulus were computable at a reasonable cost .",
    "this prompted the development of methods to infer vibrational properties from the knowledge of elastic constants .",
    "a particularly popular scheme , the moruzzi - janak schwarz ( mjs ) method @xcite , was used in many phase diagram calculations @xcite . in the cd - mg",
    "@xcite , ag - cu @xcite and au - ni @xcite systems , agreement with the experimentally measured phase diagrams was substantially improved by including vibrations in this way .",
    "in retrospect , such an improvement was to be expected because first - principles phase diagram calculations often greatly overestimate transitions temperature and _ any _ downward correction to the calculated transition temperatures yields improved agreement .",
    "the mjs approximation nearly always yields a downward correction when ordered compounds are stiffer ( softer ) than the elements in ordering ( phase separating ) systems , a very likely situation .",
    "more recently , other techniques were used to obtain vibrational properties from elastic constants . the so - called virtual crystal approximation ( described in appendix [ appdisord ] )",
    "was used to calculate the vibrational free energy of a disordered alloy in the ni - cr system @xcite .",
    "the calculated vibrational free energy exhibited qualitatively the same concentration - dependence as the vibrational free energy obtained by subtracting the experimentally determined free energy from the calculated configurational free energy .",
    "the virtual crystal approximations was also used in calculations of the lattice dynamics of ordered and disordered cu@xmath58au @xcite .",
    "these calculations , which relied on a tight - binding hamiltonian ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , predicted a @xmath59 increase in the vibrational entropy upon disordering .    in view of the large computational requirements of accurate _ ab initio _ methods ,",
    "many researchers have sought to calculate vibrational properties with simpler energy models , whose lower computational requirements enable a more accurate handling of issues such as anharmonicity or the representation of the disordered state .",
    "the development of the embedded atom method ( eam ) @xcite offered the opportunity to accurately model metallic alloys at a reasonable computational cost .",
    "investigations based on the eam have typically found a large vibrational entropy change upon disordering in metallic alloys . the vibrational entropy change for cu@xmath58au was predicted to be @xmath60 @xcite , while for ni@xmath58al , values ranging from @xmath61 to @xmath62 were obtained @xciteal is actually a metastable phase .",
    "the values quoted here are at the highest temperatures reported by the investigators , as close as possible to the true disordering temperature that would be observed if the alloy did not melt before . ] .",
    "other researchers constructed pair potentials from an equation of state determined from first - principles calculations @xcite .",
    "the resulting pair potentials were then used to calculate disordering vibrational entropies with no further approximations .",
    "this method attributed a vibrational entropy change of @xmath63 to the disordering reaction of the fe@xmath58al compound .",
    "rather unexpected results were uncovered as it became possible to compute vibrational entropy differences from a complete lattice dynamics analysis as well as state - of - the - art _ ab initio _ techniques .",
    "calculations on the si - ge system @xcite found almost no effect of lattice vibrations : the vibrational entropy of formation of the metastable zincblende structure was a mere @xmath64 .",
    "the first _ ab initio _ calculation of a vibrational entropy of disordering @xcite placed an upper bound of @xmath56 in the case of the order - disorder transition of the ni@xmath58al compound , in sharp contrast with previous eam calculations @xcite which found a much larger value . although the disagreement simply originated from a difference in the predicted volume expansion of the alloy upon disordering , the difference between eam and _ ab initio _ results does indicate that vibrational entropy differences are very sensitive to the energy model used . in another intermetallic compound , pd@xmath58v ,",
    "the vibrational entropy change upon disordering of the @xcite was calculated to be @xmath65 , although the simplest theories put forward in the earliest investigations of lattice vibrations in alloys would predict this value to be large and positive .",
    "in the first phase diagram calculation based on a full lattice dynamics analysis @xcite , the scpib method @xcite was used to calculate that vibrational effects lower the top of the miscibility gap by about @xmath66% in the cao - mgo system .",
    "subsequently , first - principles calculations on the cu - au system @xcite reported a reduction of a about @xmath67% in the transition temperatures .",
    "however , in both cases , the resulting correction on the phase boundaries decreased the agreement with the experimentally determined phase diagram , suggesting that other potential sources of error , such as the precision of the energy method used or the convergence of the cluster expansion , have to be investigated .",
    "very recently , two rather striking examples of systems where lattice vibrations do have an important effect and where their inclusion results in a a dramatically improved agreement with experimental measurements have been uncovered .",
    "lattice vibrations are responsible for a 27-fold increase in the solubility of scandium in aluminum @xcite , resulting in a nearly perfect agreement with experimentally determined solubility limits .",
    "vibrational contributions were also shown @xcite to be essential to correctly predict the relative stability of the different precipitates which constitute the well - known guinier - preston zones responsible for precipitation hardening in the al - cu system .",
    "it is interesting to note that these two successful examples did not require the use of a cluster expansion and did not necessitate a large number of separate first - principles calculations .",
    "each calculation could therefore be carried out with an extremely high precision . when all other sources of errors are well controlled , the effect of lattice vibrations can be more accurately quantified .",
    "these examples offer good hope that _",
    "ab - initio _ calculations of a complete phase diagram that include lattice vibrations can provide an accuracy comparable to experiments , provided that a well converged cluster expansion can be obtained and that highly accurate first - principles calculations are used to construct it .      over the last 10 years",
    ", advances in experimental techniques have made it possible to directly measure vibrational entropy differences , instead of inferring them from discrepancies between measured thermodynamical data and calculated estimates of configurational contributions to the free energy .",
    "experimental investigations have thus provided independent assessments of the role of lattice vibration on phase stability .",
    "the first direct measurement was obtained from differential calorimetry measurements on the ni@xmath58al compound @xcite and found the vibrational entropy of disordering to be at least @xmath68 .",
    "this finding was corroborated with subsequent incoherent neutron scattering measurements @xcite , which bracketed its value between @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "these findings fueled much of the interest of the recent theoretical literature on the ni@xmath58al compound @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the agreement between experimental and theoretical determinations is relatively poor .",
    "even among studies in which the magnitude of the vibrational entropy is similar , its proposed physical origin differs substantially : according to experiments , the vibrational entropy change occured with essentially no change in volume , while most calculations @xcite  attribute the vibrational entropy change almost entirely to a volume change .",
    "many of these conflicting findings were clarified by first - principles calculations @xcite , which predicted both a very small volume change and a very small vibrational entropy change upon disordering .",
    "these results indicated that ( i ) the apparent large vibrational entropy change observed experimentally could very well be entirely explained by the nanocrystalline nature of the samples and the use of the virtual crystal approximation in interpreting the data and ( ii ) the large volume expansion upon disordering predicted by the eam is probably an artifact of the method , as it would have otherwise been clearly visible experimentally . to be fair , fultz _",
    "et al . _ and althoff _ et al .",
    "_ were fully aware of these potential problems ; _ ab initio _ calculations merely made it possible to better quantify the errors introduced .",
    "the general consensus among researchers is now that given the numerous difficulties faced when studying ni@xmath58al , unambiguous evidence of the importance of lattice vibrations should probably be sought in other systems .",
    "similar calorimetry measurements were then performed on the fe@xmath58al @xcite and cu@xmath58au @xcite compounds , where more conclusive results could be obtained .",
    "the vibrational entropy of disordering of fe@xmath58al was determined to be @xmath60 , a result which was later corroborated by calculations @xcite . in the case of cu@xmath58al",
    "the experimental result , @xmath71 , showed very good agreement with the earlier theoretical predictions of @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "subsequent linear - response calculations @xcite yield values ranging from @xmath72 to @xmath73 ( depending on temperature ) , which also compares favorably with the experimental results .",
    "the estimation of vibrational effects was also addressed by directly probing the lattice dynamics through neutron scattering measurements .",
    "the vibrational entropy of formation of a disordered alloy in the fe - cr system was obtained from single crystal measurements of phonon dispersion curves @xcite in the virtual crystal approximation .",

    "although early investigations of the impact of vibrational effects on phase stability consistently found large effects , it is now becoming apparent , as more precise theoretical and experimental techniques became available , that vibrational effects are often , but not always , large .",
    "it is therefore important to identify the factors which determine when they are , so that the effort devoted to calculating them is proportional to their expected magnitude .",

    "three mechanisms have been suggested to explain the origin of vibrational entropy differences in alloys .",
    "we will discuss them in turn .      in most theoretical studies based on simple models systems @xcite , the effect of the state of order of an alloy on its vibrational",
    "entropy has been attributed to the fact that bonds between different chemical species have a different stiffness than the bonds between identical species . when the proportion of each type of bond in the alloy changes during , for instance , an order - disorder transition , the average stiffness of the alloy changes as well , resulting in a change of its vibrational entropy .",
    "this so - called `` bond - proportion '' mechanism is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ bondprop ] in the case of an order - disorder transition . in a system with ordering tendencies",
    ", the bond between unlike atoms are associated with an increased stability and are thus expected to be stiffer than bonds between alike atoms . since disordering reduces the number of bonds between unlike atoms in favor of bonds between similar atoms , the disordered state is expected to be softer , and",
    "thus , have a large vibrational entropy .",
    "vibrations would then tend to stabilize the disordered state relative to the ordered state , reducing the transition temperature .",
    "a similar reasoning in the case of a phase separating system shows that the disordered state should be softer than a phase separated mixture , indicating that the miscibility gap should be lowered as a result of vibrational effects .",
    "the presence of a `` bond proportion '' effect can be readily identified from the nature of the changes taking place in the phonon densities of states during an order - disorder transition . in the ordered alloy",
    ", the very stiff nearest - neighbor bonds should be associated with high frequency optical modes peaks . as the alloy disorders , the height of these peaks should decrease since the number of stiff bonds decreases .",
    "this characteristic signature of the `` bond proportion '' mechanism in the phonon dos has been repeatedly observed in experiments @xcite as well as in theoretical calculations @xcite ( although , in the latter study the `` bond proportion '' mechanism was dominated by other effects discussed below ) .",
    "it is well known that vibrational entropy of a given compound varies with volume : this dependence is responsible for thermal expansion .",
    "it is thus expected that the volume change that typically occurs during solid - state transitions should also result in a change in vibrational entropy . as the alloy expands ( or contracts ) , as a result of a change in its state of order , the stiffness of all chemical bonds decreases ( or increases ) .",
    "the resulting change in vibrational entropy is entirely due to anharmonicity , in contrast to the `` bond proportion '' effect .",
    "when the volume mechanism operates alone , the phonon dos should exhibit an overall shift when the volume changes ( see fig .",
    "[ volmech ] ) .",
    "this shift is usually accompanied by a change in the shape of the phonon dos , so that visual inspection of the phonon dos is usually not sufficient to identify the shift due to the effect of volume .",
    "theoretical investigations of this effect have thus relied on a simple thought experiment consisting in separating the vibrational entropy change upon disordering at constant volume from the vibrational entropy change resulting solely from the volume expansion of the disordered state . in this fashion ,",
    "the importance of volume changes was first observed in embedded atom method ( eam ) calculations of disordering reaction of the ni@xmath58al and cu@xmath58au compounds @xcite and later corroborated by subsequent eam calculations on the ni@xmath58al compound @xcite .",
    "these more recent calculations also found that the volume effect is magnified by the fact that the linear thermal expansion coefficient of different phases can differ substantially ( by about @xmath84 @xmath85 relative to an absolute value of about @xmath86 @xmath85 ) .",
    "first - principles calculations on the cu - au system @xcite revealed a similar finding .",
    "in contrast , first - principles calculations on the ni@xmath58al @xcite and pd@xmath58v @xcite  compounds found only a small difference between the thermal expansion coefficients of the ordered and the disordered phases ( less than @xmath87 @xmath85 ) .    even though the temperature - dependence of vibrational entropy can be large , it is important to keep in mind that a given vibrational entropy difference arising from anharmonic contributions has a smaller impact on the vibrational free energy than a harmonic contribution of the same magnitude .",
    "the reason is that anharmonic contributions to the vibrational entropy are always partly canceled by anharmonic contributions to the vibrational _",
    "enthalpy_. in contrast , such cancellation does not occur for harmonic contributions .",
    "the anharmonic vibrational free energy is then a sum of two competing contributions : @xmath88 . in contrast , harmonic contributions to the vibrational enthalpy are configuration - independent in the high - temperature limit , by the equipartition theorem , and give no net contribution to vibrational free energy differences .",
    "vibrational entropy differences originating from harmonic contributions thus enter the expression for vibrational free energy differences directly , without any partial cancellation from the enthalpic term . ]",
    "the quasiharmonic approximation predicts that anharmonic contributions have exactly half the effect of harmonic contributions ( see @xcite or appendix [ anhapp ] ) when the volume dependence of the energy is quadratic while the volume dependence of the vibrational entropy is linear .",
    "experimental measurements have not identified the volume mechanism as a major source of entropy differences since the simple thought experiment that allows its identification in calculations can not be performed experimentally . the effect of thermal expansion on the phonon dos , however , is clearly seen experimentally @xcite , due to the fact that thermal expansion causes shifts in the phonon dos that are not accompanied by substantial changes in its shape .",
    "measurements on ni@xmath58v @xcite , co@xmath58v @xcite and cu@xmath58au @xcite all show that anharmonic contributions are not negligible .",
    "the third advocated source of vibrational entropy changes is the effect of atomic size mismatch .",
    "when atoms of different sizes are constrained to coexist on a lattice , the atoms can experience compressive ( or tensile ) stress that results in locally stiffer ( or softer ) regions .",
    "when large atoms sit on neighboring lattice sites , the amplitude of their vibrations is reduced , _",
    "i.e. _ , the alloy tends to be locally stiffer .",
    "conversely , when small atoms sit on neighboring lattice sites , the extra room available results in a locally softer region .",
    "the phenomenon was first noted in eam calculations on the cu@xmath58au compound @xcite , where , in the disordered state , the presence of highly compressed pairs of au atoms lowers the vibrational entropy of the disordered state .",
    "a similar effect was found in first - principles calculations on ni@xmath58al @xcite , where very compressed pairs of al atoms where found in the disordered state . in first - principles calculations on pd@xmath58v @xcite",
    ", an even more intriguing size - related effect was observed : all three types of chemical bonds have incompatible equilibrium lengths and the vibrational entropy changes can be explained solely by the large relaxations of the atoms away from their ideal lattice sites in the disordered state .",
    "a summary of these observations can be found in @xcite .    in the experimental literature",
    ", the size mismatch effect has been described with the help of a stiff sphere picture first introduced in an investigation of the cu@xmath58au compound @xcite .",

    "we assume that    * the elastic energy of the motionless lattice is quadratic in volume ; * the high temperature limit of the free energy can be used .",
    "as shown in appendix [ anhapp ] , in this approximation , the volume expansion @xmath187 as a function of temperature takes on a particularly simple form : @xmath188 where @xmath189 is an average grneisen parameter : @xmath190 the resulting temperature dependence of the free energy is given by    @xmath191    these expressions provide a simple way to account for thermal expansion .",
    "they also allow us to estimate the changes in vibrational entropy as a function of temperature that is due to thermal expansion : @xmath192 in metallic alloys , this quantity is typically of the order of @xmath193 .",
    "there are two main simulation - based approaches to handling anharmonicity : monte carlo ( mc ) @xcite and molecular dynamics ( md ) @xcite . while both approaches are able to model anharmonicity at any level of accuracy , they suffer from two limitations .",
    "first , they are computationally demanding and therefore have , to date , been limited to simple energy models .",
    "second , they are unable to model quantum mechanical aspects of vibrations and are therefore limited to the high temperature limit .",
    "there is an interesting and useful complementarity between the quasi - harmonic model and simulation techniques @xcite .",
    "quantum effects typically become negligible in the temperature range where strong anharmonic effects , which can not be modeled accurately within the quasiharmonic framework , become important .",
    "the use of simulation techniques to determine vibrational properties bypasses the coarse graining framework presented in section [ coarse ] : both configurational and vibrational excitations are treated on the same level . when a simple energy model provides a sufficient accuracy , one can calculate thermodynamic properties directly from mc simulations where both atomic displacements and changes in chemical species are allowed during the simulation @xcite .",
    "while a full determination of a phase diagram from simulations has , to our knowledge , not been attempted , both md ( @xcite ) and mc ( @xcite ) have been used to determine differences in vibrational free energy between two phases . because neither md nor mc are able to provide free energies directly , a special integration technique needs to be used .",
    "the idea is to express a thermodynamic quantity inaccessible to mc as an integral of a quantity that _ can _ be obtained through mc .",
    "a simple example is the change free energy @xmath3 as a function of temperature at constant pressure , which can be derived from the gibbs - helmholtz relation @xmath194 where @xmath22 is the internal energy .",
    "another example is the change in entropy as a function of temperature ( at constant pressure ) which can be expressed in terms of the heat capacity : @xmath195    often , the most computationally efficient path of integration between two states is not physically meaningful .",
    "for instance , one can gradually change the interatomic potentials during the course of the simulation , in order to model a change in the configuration of the alloy , without requiring atoms to jump between lattice sites .",
    "this task is achieved by defining an effective hamiltonian @xmath196 that gradually switches from the hamiltonian @xmath197 associated with phase @xmath16 to the hamiltonian @xmath198 associated with phase @xmath199 as the switching parameter @xmath200 goes from 0 to 1 .",
    "this convenient path of integration permits the calculation of free energy differences between phases at a reasonable computational cost , with the help of the following thermodynamic relation : @xmath201 where @xmath202 is the average of the energy calculated using hamiltonian @xmath197 ( and similarly for @xmath203 .",
    "force constants and anharmonic contributions are ultimately always derived from an energy model . in this section , we discuss various energy models , from empirical potential models to first - principles techniques , and the error or bias they may introduce in the vibrational properties .",
    "simple pairwise potentials of functionals ( such as the embedded atom method ) are computationally efficient so that all vibrational properties can often be determined without any approximations beyond the ones associated with the specific energy model .",
    "for this reason , the use of simple energy models has proven to be an invaluable tool to understand trends in vibrational entropies and to test a number of approximations @xcite .",
    "several potential sources of error can arise when using pair potentials or pair functionals .",
    "the first one is that vibrational entropy is extremely sensitive to the precise nature of the relaxations that take place in an alloy and a simple energy model may not be able to accurately predict these relaxations .",
    "this problem is particularly apparent when considering the wide range of values found in the different calculations of the vibrational entropy change upon disordering of the ni@xmath58al compound @xcite .",
    "but , as shown in table [ ni3alsv ] , most of the discrepancies can be explained from differences in the predicted volume change upon disordering .",
    "this is often aggravated by the fact that simple energy models are often not fitted to phonon properties .",
    "the problem was noted in @xcite where the embedded atom potentials used were fitted to various structural energies and elastic constants @xcite .",
    "the acoustic modes were accurately extrapolated from the fit to the elastic constants , but the phonon frequencies associated with the optical modes were overestimated by about @xmath66% .",
    "the question of the accuracy of simple energy models clearly merits further attention . in this respect ,",
    "the fit of simple energy models to the results of _ ab - initio _",
    "calculations @xcite offers a promising way to include vibrational effects .    in oxides ,",
    "electronic polarization has to be included in order to correctly model both the low frequency acoustic modes and the high frequency optical modes .",
    "electronic polarization in oxides can be approximated with the so - called core and shell model @xcite .    while quantum mechanical methods are computationally more intensive , they generally provide more accurate force constants .",
    "the most obvious error introduced by the common local density approximation ( lda ) is its systematic underprediction of lattice constants which leads to an overestimation of elastic constants and phonon frequencies .",
    "this systematic error makes it difficult to compare the absolute values of calculated vibrational properties with experimental measurements .",
    "however , for the purpose of calculating phase diagrams , this bias may be less of a concern , because phase stability is determined by differences in free energies , and one would expect a large part of this systematic error to cancel out .    a practical way to alleviate",
    "the lda bias is to perform calculations at a negative pressure such that the calculated equilibrium volume agrees with the experimentally observed volume . as shown in @xcite , a very good estimate of the required negative pressure",
    "can be obtained by a concentration - weighted average of the pressure associated with the elemental solids . for the purpose of calculating elastic properties , this approach appears to outperform the most popular alternative to lda , the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) .",
    "the basic formalisms presented in section [ alloyth ] and [ bvk ] provide two natural ways to control the trade - off between accuracy and computational requirements . in the context of alloy theory ( section [ alloyth ] )",
    ", the range of the effective clusters interactions included in the cluster expansion controls how accurately the configurational dependence of vibrational properties is modeled . in the context of the harmonic ( or quasiharmonic ) treatment of lattice vibrations ( section [ bvk ] ) ,",
    "the range of the force constants included in the born - von krmn model controls the accuracy of the calculated vibrational properties for a given configuration . in principle , any desired accuracy can be reached , given sufficient computing power , by increasing the range of the interactions in both the cluster expansion and the born - von krmn models .",
    "this section seeks to answer the important question of how far these two ranges of interactions need to be pushed in order to reach the accuracy required in a typical phase diagram calculation .      the evidence that spring models including only short - range force constants are able to correctly model vibrational quantities comes from various sources .",
    "first and second nearest neighbor spring model are routinely used to fit data obtained from neutron scattering measurement of phonon dispersion curves @xcite . in the theoretical literature ,",
    "there have been direct studies of the convergence as a function of the range of interaction considered .",
    "all _ ab - initio _ studies find that short - range force constants ( first or second nearest neighbor ) permit an accurate determination of thermodynamical quantities in metals @xcite and group iv semiconductors @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that this rapid convergence of most thermodynamic quantities occurs even when the pointwise convergence rate of the phonon dos is slow .",
    "as noted before , this property arises from the fact that thermodynamic quantities are averages taken over all phonon modes and errors tend to average out .",
    "in ionic systems , the presence of long - range electrostatic interactions may require long - range force constants .",
    "however , this electrostatic effect can easily be modeled using pair interactions at a moderate computational cost .",
    "once the forces predicted from a simple electrostatic model have been subtracted , the residual forces should be parameterizable with a short - range spring model .",
    "some of the ab - initio studies of convergence have suggested additional simplifications to force constant tensors @xcite : instead of attempting to compute all force constants in each tensor , is it possible to obtain reliable results by keeping only the largest terms .",
    "we now present a hierarchy of approximations that is a formalization of these findings .    to obtain a more intuitive representation of a given force constant tensor @xmath204",
    ", we express it in a basis such that the first cartesian axis is aligned along the line joining atom @xmath8 and @xmath97 .",
    "the second axis is then taken along the highest symmetry direction orthogonal to the first axis while the third axis is chosen so obtain a right handed orthogonal coordinate system .    in the absence of symmetry , the most general force constant tensor has 9 independent elements .",
    "the first simplification , is to neglect the three body terms in the harmonic model of the energy ( _ e.g. _ @xmath205 with @xmath206 ) .",
    "physically , such terms arise from the deformation of the electronic cloud surrounding atom @xmath8 that is caused by moving atom @xmath97 and that affect the force acting on atom @xmath122 . clearly , for any force constant other than the nearest neighbor , this effect is negligibly small . even for nearest neighbor tensors , it is the most natural contribution to neglect first .",
    "in can be readily shown that a solid consisting only of pairwise harmonic interaction , the tensor associated with a pair of atoms is symmetric : @xmath207 ( this constraint is distinct from the conventional constraint : @xmath208 )    the elements of the force constant tensor can be ranked in decreasing order of expected magnitude based on three simple assumptions :    1 .",
    "force constants associated with stretching a bond are larger than the ones associated with bending it .",
    "2 .   terms relating orthogonal forces and displacements are smaller than those relating parallel forces and displacements .",
    "3 .   in the plane",
    "perpendicular to the bond , the anisotropy in the force constants is smaller than the magnitude of the force constants themselves .",
    "we then obtain @xmath209 with @xmath210  this hierarchy of force constants is important to keep in mind , given that the off - diagonal elements of the spring tensors are the most difficult to obtain from supercell calculations , requiring much bigger supercells than diagonal elements .",
    "there is evidence @xcite that even keeping only the stretching ( @xmath211 ) and isotropic bending ( @xmath212 ) terms of the nearest neighbor spring tensor can provide vibrational entropies with an accuracy of about @xmath213 @xmath214 .",
    "if this observation turns out to be generally applicable , this offers a simple way to account for vibrational effects in phase diagram calculations .",
    "if a cluster expansion of the vibrational free energy only requires a small number of eci to accurately model the configurational - dependence of the vibrational free energy , it then becomes practical to determine the values of these eci from a small number of very accurate calculations of the vibrational free energy of a few structures .",
    "the issue of the speed of convergence of the cluster expansion is also related to the task of devising  efficient ways to compute vibrational properties of disordered alloys : the faster the cluster expansion converges , the easier it is to model a disordered phase ( see appendix [ appdisord ] ) .",
    "the calculations of the vibrational entropy change upon disordering has proven to be a very effective way to assess the importance of lattice vibrations @xcite , since this quantity can be straightforwardly used to estimate the effect of lattice vibrations on transition temperatures with the help of equation ( [ tcshift ] ) .",
    "the central question is thus whether the cluster expansion of the vibrational free energy converges quickly with respect to the number of eci .",
    "this is a question distinct from the range of force constants needed to obtain accurate vibrational properties .",
    "the range of eci needed to represent the configurational dependence of vibrational free energy may very well exceed the range of the force constants .",
    "even in simple born von krmn model systems , there is no direct correspondence between eci and force constants , except in special cases ( see section [ bpmodel ] ) .",
    "once relaxations are introduced in the model , then all hope of a simple correspondence is lost @xcite .    in this context , the question of the existence of a rapidly converging cluster expansion of vibrational properties has to be answered through numerical experiments .",
    "simple energy models offer the possibility to test , at a reasonable computational cost , the speed of convergence of a cluster expansion .",
    "explicit calculations of a well converged cluster expansion of vibrational entropy in a lennard - jones solid @xcite have indicated that a small number of eci ( 9 ) can provide a good accuracy ( @xmath215 ) .",
    "other benchmarks of the speed of convergence , based on studies of disordered alloys @xcite , also indicate that concise and accurate cluster expansions are possible .",
    "experiments that seek to link features of projected phonon dos to the local chemical environment of the atoms @xcite suggest that short - range eci should be able to successfully model vibrational entropy differences .",
    "one potential source of concern is the difficulty associated with accounting for the size mismatch effect using a short - range eci @xcite . in the context of cluster expansions of the energy , relaxations of the atoms away from their ideal lattice site as a result of size mismatch are known to introduce both non negligible long range pair eci and numerous multiplet eci .",
    "a cluster expansion of the vibrational free energy is expected to exhibit the same problems .",
    "all the full phonon dos ab - initio calculations of vibrational entropies in alloy systems performed so far have relied on the rapid convergence of the cluster expansion @xcite .",
    "while efforts to quantify the error introduced by truncating the cluster expansion in ab - initio calculations have been made @xcite , the issue of the speed of convergence of the cluster expansion in the context of vibrational properties clearly merits further study , especially in light of the importance of the size mismatch effect @xcite .",
    "the experimental literature on the thermodynamics of lattice vibrations in alloys relies on mainly three techniques . in _",
    "differential calorimetry _",
    "measurements , the heat capacity of two samples in a different state of order is compared over a range of temperatures .",
    "if the upper limit of the range of temperatures is chosen to be sufficiently low , substitutional exchanges will not occur and the difference in heat capacity can be assumed to arise solely from vibrational effects .",
    "integration of the difference in heat capacity ( divided by temperature ) then yields a direct measure of the vibrational entropy differences between the two samples of the range of temperature considered .",
    "this , of course , assumes that the lower temperature bound is sufficiently low , so that the vibrational entropy of both samples can be assumed to be zero at that temperature .",
    "it also assumes that the electronic contribution to the heat capacity is negligible . in practice ,",
    "both assumptions are typically satisfied .",
    "the main problem with this method is that one is usually interested in vibrational entropy differences at the transition temperature of the alloy , which is usually above the upper limit of the temperature range used in the heat capacity measurements .",
    "the heat capacity therefore needs to be extrapolated to high temperature .",
    "this constitutes the main source of inaccuracies in this method .",
    "examples of the use of this method can be found in @xcite .",
    "a second method is the measurement of phonon dispersion curve through _ inelastic neutron scattering_. for ordered alloys that can be produced in large single crystals , this method is very powerful .",
    "once the dispersion curves along special directions in reciprocal space are measured , they can be used to fit born - von krmn spring models which , in turn , yield the normal frequencies for any point in the brillouin zone . with the help of the standard statistical mechanics techniques described in section [ bvk",
    "] , this information is sufficient to determine the vibrational entropy .",
    "examples of applications of this method can be found in @xcite .",
    "the applicability of this method is unfortunately limited by the availability of large single crystals .",
    "the case of disordered alloys presents an even more fundamental problem : disordered alloys do not have well defined dispersion curves and there is no straightforward way to fit the spring constants of a spring model from the experimental data .",
    "this problem is usually addressed by using the virtual crystal approximation , in which different constituent atoms are replaced by one `` average '' type of atom ( see appendix [ appdisord ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , this approximation has repeatedly been shown to have a very limited accuracy for the purpose of measuring vibrational entropy differences @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , single crystal phonon dispersion curve measurements for ordered alloys present a unique opportunity to perform a stringent test of the accuracy of theoretical models .",
    "a third method is the determination of the phonon density of states from _ incoherent neutron scattering _ measurements .",
    "in contrast to the preceding approach , this method can readily be applied to disordered systems and to compounds for which single crystals are not available @xcite .",
    "the main limitation of this approach is that different atomic species have different neutron scattering cross - sections .",
    "the scattered intensity at each frequency measures a `` density of states '' , where each mode is weighted by the scattering intensity of the atoms participating in the mode in question .",
    "thus , one needs some prior information about the vibrational modes in order to reconstruct the true phonon dos from the experimental data . in the case of alloys",
    ", there is not a one - to - one correspondence between the measured data and the vibrational entropy .",
    "this problem can be alleviated by choosing alloy systems where the scattering intensity of each species is similar @xcite .",
    "other techniques have been used to measure vibrational entropy differences .",
    "some researchers have used the fact that vibrational entropy and thermal expansion are directly related , to estimate vibrational entropy differences from accurate thermal expansion measurements @xcite .",
    "the measurement of inelastic nuclear resonant scattering spectrum has also been used to relate changes in the phonon dos to changes in the short - range order of a disordered alloy @xcite .",
    "finally , relatively noisy estimates of vibrational entropy differences can be obtained from x - ray debye - waller factors or from the measurement of mean square relative displacement ( msrd ) of the atoms relative to their neighbors through extended electron energy - loss fine structure ( exelfs ) @xcite .",
    "while the ability to control the level of approximation discussed in the previous section is extremely useful , there remains the problem that , very often , only considering the first few levels in this hierarchy of approximations already involves substantial computational requirements .",
    "for this reason , models of lattice vibrations that involve fewer parameters but more physical intuition may provide a practical mean of including vibrational effects in phase diagram calculations . in this section",
    ", we will present the advantages and weaknesses of each method , in light of the three fundamental mechanisms described in the section [ secmecha ] .",
    "there have been many attempts ( see , for instance , @xcite ) to find ways to express the relationship between the vibrational free energy and the dynamical matrix in a form that illustrates the intuition behind the `` bond proportion '' mechanism . in a variety of simple model systems ,",
    "a convenient exact expression can be derived for the nearest neighbor eci in the expansion of the vibrational free energy in the high temperature limit . for simple nearest - neighbor spring models with central forces in linear chains @xcite ,",
    "square lattices @xcite or simple cubic lattices @xcite , the nearest neighbor eci is given by @xmath216 where @xmath217 , @xmath218 and @xmath219 are , respectively , the spring constants associated with @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 bonds and @xmath223 is the dimensionality of the system .",
    "it has been noted , on the basis of numerical experiments , that the same expression performs well for other lattices @xcite .",
    "this success arises from the fact that , as shown in appendix [ anal1nn ] ,  equation ( [ eci1nn ] ) is the first order approximation to the true vibrational entropy change in a large class of systems which satisfies the following assumptions :    * the high temperature limit of the vibrational entropy is appropriate ; * the nearest - neighbor force constants can be written as @xmath224 where @xmath225 denotes the ( scalar ) stiffness of the spring connecting sites @xmath8 and @xmath97 with occupations @xmath7 and @xmath226 while the @xmath227 are dimensionless spring constant tensors .",
    "the @xmath227 are assumed equivalent under a symmetry operation of the space group of the parent lattice ; * all force constants @xmath225 are such that @xmath228    equation ( [ eci1nn ] ) applies to simple harmonic models with nearest neighbor springs on the fcc , bcc or sc primitive lattices ( and , approximately , on the hcp lattice ) , as long as the above assumptions are satisfied . both stretching and bending terms are allowed in the spring tensors , as long as their relative magnitude is independent of @xmath229 ( _ e.g. _ when the bending terms are always , say , 10% of the corresponding stretching term , regardless of the magnitude of the stretching term ) .",
    "if force constants , other than bending or stretching terms , are important , the bond proportion model ceases to be valid .",
    "this can be seen by the following argument .",
    "the `` bond proportion '' picture requires every bond of a certain type ( for instance , @xmath220 bonds ) to have an identical spring tensor .",
    "however , the point symmetry of each bond can be different and similar chemical bonds in different environment face different symmetry - induced constraints on their spring tensors @xcite .",
    "the only way to reconcile these observations is use a spring tensor that is compatible with the highest possible symmetry , ensuring that it is also compatible with any other environment with a lower symmetry . with the highest possible symmetry ,",
    "only two independent terms remain in the spring tensor : the stretching and bending terms .",
    "equation ( [ eci1nn ] ) embodies the essential intuition behind the effect of the alloy s state of order on its vibrational free energy .",
    "when one replaces an @xmath220 bond and a @xmath221 bond by two @xmath222 bonds , the vibrational free energy will decrease only if the stiffness of @xmath222 bonds , @xmath219 , exceeds the geometrical average stiffness of the bonds between identical species @xmath230 .",
    "this observation allows the determination of the expected effect of vibrations on the shape of the phase diagram by simple arguments .",
    "the link between the nearest neighbor eci of the expansion of the vibrational entropy can be summarized by the expression @xcite : @xmath231 where the `` @xmath232 '' and `` @xmath233 '' correspond to ordering and segregating systems , respectively , and where @xmath16 is a dimensionless parameter that only depends on the lattice type and the ordering tendency of the system ( for instance , for fcc , @xmath234 in ordering systems and @xmath235 in segregating systems , while for bcc , @xmath236 in both cases ) .",
    "it is straightforward to include vibrational effects in phase diagram calculations using the `` bond proportion '' model .",
    "all that is needed is an estimate of the stiffness of @xmath220 , @xmath221 and @xmath222 bonds , which could come , for instance , from supercell calculations of the nearest neighbor force constants in a few simple structures or from the bulk moduli of the pure elements and one ordered compound .",
    "the nearest neighbor eci then obtained can be simply added to the cluster expansion of the energy .    while equation ( [ eci1nn ] )",
    "is useful to estimate the importance of the `` bond proportion '' mechanism in a given system , one can avoid some of the approximations involved in deriving equation ( [ eci1nn ] ) at the expense of only a modest amount of additional effort .",
    "one can find the exact phonon dos of the nearest neighbor born - von krmn model for a variety of configurations of the alloy , which allows a more accurate cluster expansion of the vibrational energy to be derived . in this fashion , the condition specified in equation ( [ cond1o ] ) is no longer needed and the vibrational entropy can be calculated at any temperature .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that two important assumptions are made when invoking the `` bond proportion '' mechanism .",
    "first , vibrational entropies are solely determined by the nearest neighbor force constants .",
    "there is theoretical evidence that nearest neighbor spring models can predict vibrational entropy differences with an accuracy of about @xmath237 in metallic @xcite and semiconductor @xcite systems .",
    "given that configurational entropy differences are typically of the order of @xmath238 , this precision should be sufficient for practical phase diagram calculations .",
    "the second assumption is that each type of chemical bond is assumed to have an intrinsic stiffness that is independent of its environment .",
    "first - principles calculations on the li - al @xcite and on the pd - v system @xcite unfortunately indicate that the stiffness of a chemical bond does change substantially as a function of its environment .",
    "this problem is serious , as it considerably limits the applicability of the `` bond proportion '' model .",
    "these changes of the intrinsic stiffness of the bonds as a function of their environment are precisely the focus of the two other suggested sources of vibrational entropy changes . in summary , while the `` bond proportion '' model gives an elegant description of one of the mechanisms suggested to be at the origin of vibrational entropy differences , it completely ignores the two other mechanisms , namely , the volume and size mismatch effects .",
    "perhaps the most widespread approximation to the phonon dos @xmath239 is the debye model ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , where the phonon problem is solved in the acoustic limit . in this case , the phonon dos is approximated by : @xmath240 where @xmath241 and @xmath242 is the debye temperature , given by : @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the debye sound velocity , defined by @xmath245 where the right - hand side is the directional average of a function of the three sound velocities @xmath246 @xcite .",
    "the free energy of a debye solid is given by : @xmath247 where the debye function @xmath248 is given by @xmath249    since the debye sound velocity @xmath244 is a complicated function of all elastic constants of the material , an approximation to the debye temperature that only involves the bulk modulus proves extremely useful .",
    "such an approximation was derived by moruzzi , janak and schwarz ( mjs ) @xcite for cubic materials : @xmath250 where @xmath251 is the average atomic volume @xmath167 is the bulk modulus and @xmath252 is the concentration weighted arithmetic mean of the atomic masses . as noted in @xcite , in the high temperature limit , the mjs model does not exhibit the required property that the masses have no effect on the vibrational free energy of formation , although using a geometric average of the masses @xcite fixes this problem .",
    "the quasiharmonic approximation can be used , within debye theory , to account for mild anharmonicity . in the so - called debye - grneisen approximation ,",
    "the volume - dependence of the phonon dos is modeled by a single grneisen parameter and the effect of volume can be summarized by simply making the debye temperature volume - dependent : @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the debye temperature at volume @xmath255 and @xmath256 is the grneisen parameter .    despite of its inaccurate description of the true phonon dos at high frequencies , the debye and debye - grneisen models are quite successful at modeling the changes in vibrational properties of a given compound as a function of temperature . for instance , the thermal properties of pure metals @xcite calculated in mjs approximation are surprisingly accurate .",
    "the reason for this success is that most thermodynamic quantities ( _ e.g. _ free energy , entropy , heat capacity , etc . )",
    "exhibit their most dramatic variations at low temperature , where the low frequency phonon modes that are correctly described by the debye model have a dominant effect . in the high temperature regime ,",
    "thermodynamic quantities are determined by the classical equipartition theorem , and any harmonic model gives the correct behavior .",
    "debye - like models are expected to perform well in systems where the differences in vibrational free energy between compounds can be explained by uniform shifts of the phonon dos , such as when the volume effect operates alone .",
    "such a behavior has been observed in embedded atom calculations on the ni  al system @xcite but in no other systems so far .",
    "the mjs approximation has been used to include vibrational effects in phase diagram calculations and has resulted in an improved agreement with experimental results @xcite .    however , as shown in @xcite , the debye approximation and its successors can have significant shortcomings when used to calculate phase diagrams .",
    "a significant part of the vibrational free energy differences between different compounds arises from changes in the high frequency portion of the phonon dos , which debye - like models describe incorrectly . in some cases ,",
    "the mjs approximation can even lead to an incorrect prediction of the sign of the vibrational entropy difference @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the debye model and its derivatives capture the essential physics behind only one of the advocated mechanisms responsible for the configurational dependence of vibrational free energy : the volume effect .",
    "approximations based on the debye model , however , fail to account for the possibility that the state of order also has a direct impact ( _ i.e. _ not through the volume ) on the shape of the phonon dos ( as predicted , for instance , by the `` bond proportion '' model ) .",
    "the perfect complement to the debye model is the einstein model ( see , for instance , @xcite ) , which focuses on the high frequency region of the phonon dos , instead of its low frequency region .",
    "the einstein model assumes that a crystalline solid can be modelled by a collection of @xmath102 independent harmonic oscillators ( 3 per atom ) sharing a common frequency .",
    "this frequency can , for instance , be determined by computing the natural frequency of oscillation of one atom when all others are frozen in place .",
    "this approach , known as the local harmonic model @xcite , has proven especially useful to calculate vibrational entropies associated with defects @xcite .",
    "the einstein model can also be combined with a debye model to better fit experimental calorimetry data @xcite or thermal expansion data @xcite .",
    "the local harmonic model is of little use whenever the system of interest exhibits translational symmetry , because the calculations required to determine the unknown parameters of an einstein model from first - principles directly provide force constants .",
    "the latter could be used to obtain a more precise description of the dos rather than the single - value dos characterizing the einstein model .",
    "the einstein model is nevertheless extremely useful for conceptual purposes , as we will now illustrate .",
    "as shown in appendix [ einstein ] , the vibrational free energy of a system is bounded by above and by below by the free energy of two einstein - like systems : @xmath257 while the upper bound is obtained from the usual local harmonic model , where surrounding atoms do not relax , the lower bound is obtained when the surrounding atoms are allowed to relax freely .",
    "another way to interpret these bounds is that at one extreme , each atom sees the others as having an infinite mass , while at the other extreme , each atom sees the other atoms as being massless .",
    "this result supports the view that vibrational free energy can be meaningfully considered as a measure of the average stiffness of each atom s local environment .    a more rigorous way of defining the contribution of an atom to the total vibrational free energy is the use of the projected dos ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",

    "it would thus be extremely helpful if the force constants determined in one structure could be used to predict force constants in another structure . from the failures of the `` bond proportion '' model ,",

    "there are numerous advantages to this approach . from a conceptual point of view",
    ", this model presents a concise way to represent all three mechanism suggested to be the source of vibrational entropy differences .",
    "the `` bond proportion '' mechanism is the particular case obtained when little changes in bond length occur .",
    "the volume effect results from expanding all bonds by the same factor .",
    "the size mismatch effect ( or the `` stiff sphere '' picture ) is also modeled since the local change in stiffness resulting from locally compressed or expanded regions are explicitly taken into account . a straightforward way to represent the source of vibrational changes is to overlap the stiffness vs. length relationship and the changes in average length and stiffness in different states of order , as shown in fig .",
    "[ shiftstiff ] .",
    "a second advantage of this method is computational efficiency .",
    "the unknown parameters of the model can be determined by a small number of supercell or linear response calculations .",
    "after that , the knowledge of the relaxed geometry of a structure is sufficient to determine the stiffness of all chemical bonds . finding the vibrational entropy of the structure then just reduces to a computationally inexpensive born - von krmn phonon problem .",
    "it is important to note that the knowledge of the relaxed geometries of a set of structures is a natural by - product of first - principles calculations of structural energies , which are needed to construct the cluster expansion of the energy in phase diagram calculations , whether vibrational effects are included or not . since computational requirements do not grow rapidly with the number of structures considered , this opens the way for a much more accurate representation of the configurational - dependence of the vibrational free energy .",
    "a third advantage of transferable bond stiffness vs. bond length relationships is that they contain all the information needed to account for thermal expansion as well , within the quasi - harmonic approximation .",
    "the slopes of the stiffness vs. length relationships for each chemical bonds explicitly defines the changes in phonon frequencies as volume changes .",
    "since the bulk modulus of each structure is also a by - product of structural energy calculations , all the ingredients needed for a quasi - harmonic treatment of thermal expansion are available .",
    "lattice vibrations can have a significant impact on phase transition temperatures , short - range order , solubility limits , and the sequence in which phases appear as a function of temperature .",
    "the standard framework of alloy theory can be straightforwardly extended to account for lattice vibrations using the concept of coarse graining of the partition function .",
    "once the degrees of freedom associated with lattice vibrations are integrated out , one is left with a standard ising model , where the energy of each spin configuration is replaced by its vibrational free energy . the efficient evaluation of the vibrational free energy of each configuration is the main problem limiting the inclusion of lattice vibrations in phase diagram calculations .",
    "a number of investigations have sought to assess the importance of vibrational effects on phase stability , in order to ensure that the efforts involved in computing vibrational properties are justified .",
    "the conclusion of the most reliable of these studies is that vibrational entropy differences are typically on the order of @xmath0 @xmath214 to @xmath268 @xmath214 , which is comparable to the magnitude of configurational entropy differences ( at most @xmath269 @xmath214 in binary alloys ) , thereby indicating that vibrations have a nonnegligible impact .",
    "the calculation of the vibrational free energy of a particular configuration of the alloy reduces to the well known phonon problem in crystals . while the standard harmonic treatment of this problem lacks the ability to model thermal expansion , which can have a significant impact on thermodynamic properties in alloys , this limitation is easily overcome with the help of the quasiharmonic model .",
    "an exact solution to the phonon problem for all possible configurations requires excessive computing power .",
    "however , the tradeoff between accuracy and computational requirements can be controlled in two ways , namely through the selection of the range of force constants in the born - von krmn model , and through a choice of the number of eci used to expand the configuration dependence of the vibrational free energy . while there is evidence that the range of force constants can be kept very small ( first nearest neighbor springs ) , the configurational dependence of the vibrational free energy is too complex to permit a drastic reduction in the number of eci .",
    "given the substantial computing power required to undertake lattice dynamics calculations , many attempts have been made to devise simpler models .",
    "for many years , the mjs approximation appeared to be a very promising way to include vibrational effects in phase diagram calculations , because it systematically improved the agreement between first - principles calculations and experimental measurements .",
    "this success may have been the result of two fortunate circumstances ( i ) first - principles phase diagram calculations typically overestimate transitions temperature and ( ii ) the mjs approximation nearly always yields a downward correction to the transition temperature . as the accuracy of phase diagram calculations improved through the use of longer - range cluster expansions @xcite , the systematic bias in the calculated transitions temperature substantially decreased . simultaneously , more sophisticated models of lattice vibrations indicated that lattice vibrations do not always results in a reduction in the transition temperatures @xcite .",
    "the net effect of these two trends is that , although the accuracy of first - principles calculations has increased over the years , obtaining improved agreement with experiment is now a much more stringent test . as a result",
    ", perfectly valid and accurate calculations of vibrational effects sometimes reduce the agreement with experiments @xcite . hence ,",
    "before one can unambiguously assess the importance of lattice vibrations through a full phase diagram calculation , all potential sources of error have to be carefully controlled , such as the precision of the energy model used and more importantly , the accuracy of the cluster expansion . to date , the most convincing evidence that taking lattice vibrations into account significantly improves agreement with experimental results comes from calculations of the lattice dynamics associated with a specific atomic configuration ( _ e.g. _ a given compound or an isolated point defect ) @xcite . in these settings , most sources of errors are under control and definite answers can be given .",
    "although the availability of more accurate computational tools has revealed that the trends in vibrational entropy differences between phases is far more complex that anticipated ten years ago ( @xcite ) , a simple picture of the mechanisms at work is now emerging .",
    "all the known sources of vibrational entropy differences can be conveniently summarized by the `` bond stiffness vs. bond length '' model @xcite . in this picture , each type of chemical bond is characterized by a length - dependent spring constant .",
    "changes in vibrational entropy can originate from both changes in the proportion of each chemical bond and changes in their lengths as a result of local and global relaxations .",
    "this model not only provides an intuitive understanding of lattice vibrations in alloys , but also a practical way of including their effects in phase diagram calculations .",
    "this stiffness vs. length relationship of each type of chemical bond can be inferred from a small number of lattice dynamics calculations .",
    "the vibrational properties of any configuration can then be obtained at a very low computational cost from the knowledge of the equilibrium geometry of this configuration , an information that is already a natural by - product of any phase diagram calculation .",
    "future investigations of the effect of lattice vibrations on phase stability should head towards three main directions .    1 .   while reporting error bars is an important part of any experimentalists work",
    ", theorists should devote significantly more effort to quantifying the uncertainties of their calculations .",
    "this would make it possible to clearly identify situations where the improved agreement with experimental results following the inclusion of vibrational effects is truly significant or merely the result of fortunate coincidences .",
    "it is admittedly difficult to quantify the errors introduced by the energy model ( such as the lda ) , but standard statistical techniques can clearly be used to quantify any error due to fitting the _ ab initio _ data with a simple model .",
    "2 .   given the difficulty of extracting vibrational entropies from experimental data , theorists should undertake the computation of quantities that _ can _ be directly measured .",
    "for instance , a born - von krmn model directly enables the simulation of incoherent neutron scattering data , while the inverse procedure is a highly non unique operation .",
    "the calculation of thermal expansion coefficients would also be a very sensitive test .",
    "there have so far been very few accurate phase diagram calculations that include the effect of lattice vibrations .",
    "the main limitation remains the determination of a cluster expansion that accurately models the configurational dependence of vibrational free energy .",
    "the `` bond length vs. bond stiffness '' model should prove to be an extremely useful tool in achieving this goal .",
    "although this approximation has been very successful in all systems to which it has been applied , the confirmation of its validity in a wider range of systems is crucial",

    "for an instability with respect to unit cell deformation , @xmath349 could be half the change in the average nearest neighbor distance induced by the displacive transformation .",
    "the boundedness of the portion of phase space associated with @xmath11 can be accounted for by replacing the usual classical partition function associated with one normal mode of oscillation @xmath8 by @xmath350 where @xmath351 is the @xmath8-th eigenvalue of the dynamical matrix , @xmath111 is planck s constant and @xmath352 is a measure of the size of the phase space neighborhood of @xmath11 along the direction associated with normal mode @xmath8 .",
    "this size parameter can be expressed in terms of the parameter @xmath349 just introduced .",
    "let @xmath353 where @xmath354 is the @xmath8-th eigenvector of @xmath124 and @xmath355 is the mass of atom @xmath97 .",
    "after normalizing @xmath356 so that @xmath357 , the number of atom in the system , we can then write @xmath358 where the maximum is taken over all nearest neighbor pairs of atoms @xmath359 .",
    "this choice of integration bounds approximately defines a neighborhood of @xmath11 such that no atom moves farther than @xmath349 from its position at the saddle point ( relative to its neighbors ) . in this approximation ,",
    "the free energy of an unstable state is given by : @xmath360 where @xmath361 is the frequency of normal mode @xmath8 and where the error function for real or imaginary arguments is given by @xmath362 the suggested definition of the free energy of an unstable configuration has interesting properties .",
    "first , as the neighborhood size @xmath352 increases , the expression reduces to the usual harmonic expression .",
    "the effect of the correction is not limited to unstable modes : modes that are so soft that it is likely that the motion of the atoms exceeds @xmath349 are also affected .",
    "there may obviously be other definitions of @xmath352 .",
    "the above example simply gives an example of how it could be calculated .",
    "going back to our initial example of the @xmath363 instability , we can now outline how this problem could be handled within the traditional coarse graining scheme .",
    "two separate clusters expansion need to be constructed , one for the bcc phases and one for the fcc phases .",
    "but since we now know how to assign a free energy to the unstable @xmath344 configuration , the fcc cluster expansion can be successfully defined .",
    "the free energy attributed to the @xmath344 configuration should be sufficiently high so that the free energy curve of the fcc phase in the vicinity of 0.5 concentration will lie above the free energy curve of the bcc phase , as it should .",
    "the fact that both cvm or monte carlo calculations on the fcc lattice would attribute a positive probability to @xmath344-like structures should not be regarded as a problem : this is precisely what will ensure that the calculated fcc free energy curve lies above the bcc one .",
    "the discussion has so far been concerned with the expression of the partition function , which is the relevant quantity to consider when the phase diagram is calculated with the cvm or the low temperature expansion .",
    "let us now consider the implications of this approach to monte - carlo simulations .",
    "thermodynamic quantities derived from averages , such as the average energy , are obviously unaffected by the presence of unstable configurations . for quantities derived from fluctuations , such as the heat capacity ,",
    "slight modifications are needed . in traditional monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the heat capacity arising from vibrational degrees of freedom is consistently neglected , and any thermodynamic quantity obtained from monte carlo can be unambiguously interpreted as the configurational contribution . in the more general setting presented here , there is an overlap between vibrational and configurational fluctuations and the only way to obtain well defined thermodynamic quantities is to fully account for the vibrational fluctuations .",
    "fortunately , there is a straightforward way to do so .",
    "the total variance of the energy ( or any other quantity ) can be exactly expressed as a sum of the variance within each configuration @xmath11 and the variance of the average energy of each configuration : @xmath364 where @xmath365 is the probability of finding the system in state @xmath11,@xmath43 while @xmath366 and @xmath367 .",
    "the first term is the usual fluctuation obtained from monte carlo .",
    "the second term is a correction which takes the form of a simple configuration average of fluctuations within each configuration .",
    "the fluctuation of a system constrained to remain in the vicinity of configuration @xmath11 is usually just as simple to determine as its average properties . in the case of energy ,",
    "the fluctuations within each configuration are simply related the heat capacity of a harmonic solid .",
    "the main objective of this section was to show that there is no fundamental problem associated with unstable states in coarse graining formalism .",
    "while it is true that the free energy of an unstable configuration is not uniquely defined , once a particular way to coarse grain phase space is chosen , the free energy of all configurations can be defined in a consistent fashion .",
    "there are admittedly some practical issues to be resolved regarding the practical implementation of coarse graining in the presence of instabilities , but the approach suggested in this section indicates that these difficulties can be overcome .",
