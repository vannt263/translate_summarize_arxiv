    "in order to shed light on a large number of unsolved questions in fundamental physics @xcite , the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern had been designed , installed , tested , and repaired in the past two decades and finally , started normal operation in the end of the year 2009 . since then , a tremendous amount of experimental data in various aspects of high energy physics has been obtained and received much attention by theoretical physicists . although the most exciting prediction , the _ higgs _",
    "boson , has not been observed in the data from the lhc experiments @xcite , the extracted bulk properties of the high temperature fireball created in such ultra - relativistic collisions have provided unprecedented information for fundamental investigations of the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) .",
    "here we want to explore the expansion properties of the created matter by investigating the spatial shape of the fireball .",
    "although it is known that one can not measure the emission time pattern and/or the spatial profile of the source directly , a well - established technique , called `` femtoscopy '' or `` hbt '' ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) can be employed to obtain this information .",
    "femtoscopy has been extensively used in the heavy ion community since it provides the most direct link to the lifetime and size of nuclear reactions .",
    "the alice collaboration has published first results of two - pion bose - einstein correlations in both p - p @xcite and central pb - pb @xcite collisions at lhc energies in the beginning of the year 2011 .",
    "these experimental results have attracted the research interest of several theoretical groups @xcite , whose models are based on hydrodynamic / hydrokinetic and hadronic microscopic approaches .    in this paper we show for the first time results for the hbt radii of two - pion correlations from central ( @xmath3 of the total cross section @xmath4 ) pb - pb collisions at the lhc energy @xmath0 tev from the ultra - relativistic quantum molecular dynamics ( urqmd ) model @xcite .",
    "the calculations are compared to alice data as well as to those at the rhic energy @xmath5 gev .",
    "the urqmd calculation results for p - p collisions at lhc energies are presented in @xcite .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows : in section 2 , a brief description of the urqmd model and the treatment of the hbt correlations as well as the corresponding gaussian fitting procedure is shown .",
    "section 3 gives the main results of the model calculations .",
    "finally , in section 4 , a summary is given .",
    "urqmd @xcite is a microscopic many - body approach to p - p , p - a , and a - a interactions at energies ranging from sis up to lhc .",
    "it is based on the covariant propagation of mesons and baryons .",
    "furthermore it includes rescattering of particles , the excitation and fragmentation of color strings , and the formation and decay of hadronic resonances . at lhc ,",
    "the inclusion of hard partonic interactions in the initial stage is important and is treated via the pythia @xcite model .    in the present study ,",
    "the cascade mode of the latest version ( v3.3 ) of urqmd is used ( for details of version 3.3 . see @xcite ) . some predictions and comparison works with data from reactions at lhc",
    "have already been pursued based on this version and showed encouraging results for the bulk properties @xcite .    to obtain hbt radii , first , about 200 and 10000 central events are calculated for pb - pb collisions at lhc and for au - au at rhic , respectively .",
    "then , all particles with their phase space distributions at their respective freeze - out time ( last collisions ) from urqmd are put into an analyzing program using the formalism of the well known `` correlation after - burner '' ( crab ) @xcite . at",
    "last , the constructed two - pion hbt correlator ( regardless of charge ) in the longitudinally co - moving system ( lcms ) @xcite without influence of residual interactions is fitted ( using the @xmath6 method ) with a three - dimensional gaussian form expressed as    @xmath7 . \\label{fit1}\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "( [ fit1 ] ) , @xmath8 represents the fraction of correlated pairs @xcite and @xmath9 is the pair relative momentum @xmath10 in the @xmath11 direction , @xmath12 being the momenta of the particles .",
    "@xmath13 is the longitudinal direction along the beam axis , @xmath14 the outward direction along the transverse component of the average momentum @xmath15 of two particles ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath17 the sideward direction perpendicular to the afore mentioned directions .",
    "the effect of cross terms with @xmath18 on the hbt radii is found to be negligible in the present fits when a pseudorapidity cut @xmath19 is used , as in experiments , and is not discussed in this paper .    for central collisions ,",
    "the hbt radii are , except for an implicit @xmath20 dependence , related to regions of homogeneity by @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the spatio - temporal separation of the particles in a pair and @xmath26@xmath27",
    ". if no space - momentum correlations are present the regions of homogeneity and the source size coincide .",
    "in central collisions the relation @xmath28 is satisfied .",
    "thus @xmath29 and @xmath30 differ mainly in the last two terms of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ro ] ) .",
    "the first of these two terms is dependent on the strength of the correlation of emission time and transverse emission position , while the second one is especially sensitive to the particle emission duration .",
    "bin @xmath31 mev / c and @xmath19 . when projecting on one axis the other two components are restricted to the range ( -30 @xmath32 30 ) mev / c.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the correlation functions are studied in bins of the transverse momentum @xmath33 .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the projections of the three - dimensional correlation function ( points ) and of the respective fit ( lines ) for the @xmath34 bin @xmath31 mev / c .",
    "it is seen clearly that the correlator in sideward direction can be described by a gaussian form fairly well .",
    "however , it deviates slightly from a gaussian in the other two directions , especially in the longitudinal direction , as found and discussed in previous publications for hics at lower energies @xcite . at lhc ,",
    "the fraction of excited unstable particles is much larger than at lower beam energies , therefore , the non - gaussian effect is more pronounced in the current calculations . at rhic energies ,",
    "the non - gaussian effect was also seen in the experimental hbt correlator , especially in the longitudinal direction @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when comparing our fitting result in fig .  [ fig1 ] with that observed in experiment ( in fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , it is seen that the non - gaussian effect is stronger in our calculations than in experiment .",
    "this might be due to the omission of all potential interactions between particles in the current cascade calculations .",
    "support for this interpretation was found in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the consideration of a mean - field potential plus coulomb potential significantly reduced the non - gaussian effect on correlators of pions from hics at ags energies . therefore ,",
    "both a dynamic treatment of the particle transport with a proper equation of state ( eos ) for the qgp phase and the hadron phase , and further theoretical development of the fitting formalism are equally important for a more precise extraction of spatio - temporal information of the source @xcite .     versus emission time distribution of pions with cuts @xmath19 , 200 @xmath35 300 mev / c , @xmath36 100 mev / c , and @xmath37 199 fm / c .",

    "[ fig2 ] , title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=49.5% ]    besides the non - gaussian effect , the contribution of the correlation between the emission time and position to the hbt radii , especially in the outward direction , has been paid more attention in recent years since it closely relates to the stiffness of the eos of nuclear matter especially at the early stage of the whole dynamic process @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( a ) we show the calculated emission time versus transverse position @xmath41 of pions .",
    "the cuts @xmath19 and 200 @xmath42 mev / c are adopted to have the same acceptance as for the extraction of the hbt radii . at the same time , since the correlation function and thus the hbt radii are mainly sensitive to pairs with small momentum difference , a cut on the relative pair momentum @xmath43 mev / c is applied as well .",
    "further , in order to remove the contribution of long - lived resonances , a cut on the freeze - out time ( @xmath44 199 fm / c ) is used .",
    "it is found that , even in the cascade calculation , there exists a visibly positive correlation between the emission time and position . to further analyze the importance of the @xmath45 correlation",
    ", we quantitatively calculate all three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ro ] ) and show them in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) as a function of @xmath34 . as a whole , although the magnitude of the @xmath45 correlation term ( @xmath46 -300 @xmath47 ) is as big as that of the emission region term ( @xmath48 200 @xmath47 ) , the most important contribution to @xmath49 comes from the emission duration term ( @xmath50 1000 @xmath47 ) .",
    "it implies that both a shorter duration time and a stronger @xmath45 correlation lead to a smaller @xmath49 value , which will be further discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] specialized for the result of hbt radii .",
    "here , it is interesting to see that the direct computation of @xmath49 leads to a value of @xmath51 30 fm which is larger than the value extracted from the gaussian fit to the correlation function by about a factor of three , as was also observed in the ampt model calculations for au - au collisions at rhic @xcite .",

    "parameters for central ( @xmath54 ) au - au collisions at rhic energy @xmath5 gev are also shown .",
    "lines with up - triangles and crosses are for model calculations while scattered symbols are for experimental data of star / rhic and alice / lhc collaborations taken from @xcite",
    ". lines with circles and diamonds show results with an artificially decreased emission duration by a factor of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , separately , in the analysis of correlation function.,scaledwidth=90.0% ]    fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the @xmath34 dependence of the hbt radii @xmath49 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , as well as the ratio @xmath2 , extracted from the gaussian fit to the two - pion correlators .",
    "the urqmd cascade calculations for central pb - pb collisions at lhc energy @xmath0 tev ( lines with crosses ) and central au - au collisions at rhic energy @xmath5 gev ( lines with up - triangles ) are compared to corresponding experimental data by alice / lhc ( open stars ) and star / rhic ( open diamonds ) .",
    "a strong decrease of the three hbt - radii with @xmath34 is seen both in experiments and in the urqmd calculations for hics .",
    "this implies a substantial expansion of the source and is qualitatively captured by the urqmd dynamics . following experimental results , the calculated hbt radii for pb - pb at lhc",
    "are found to be larger than those for au - au at rhic .",
    "the largest increase exists in the longitudinal direction , which is also seen by the experiments .",
    "although the comparison of the calculated hbt radii @xmath53 and @xmath52 with corresponding data at rhic is fairly well , it gets worse when going to the higher lhc energy . at lhc the calculated @xmath52 values at all @xmath34",
    "are found to be slightly smaller than data , while @xmath53 and @xmath49 values are larger than data .",
    "together with large calculated @xmath49 , the emission time related quantity @xmath2 is found to be markedly larger than the data .    from eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ro ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) it is clear that the value of @xmath49 is strongly dependent on the emission duration of the particles . to further investigate the contribution of the emission duration to the hbt radii , we artificially decrease it by rescaling the relative time @xmath25 to the `` effective source center time '' @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) by @xmath59 in the calculation of the correlation function at lhc energies",
    "this effectively changes eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ro ] ) to @xmath60 the results for this calculation are presented as lines with circles ( @xmath55 ) and with diamonds ( @xmath61 ) in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the artificially decreased emission duration leads to smaller @xmath49 values in all @xmath34 bins but leaves @xmath52 unchanged , as expected .",
    "overall it results in an improved agreement with the data of @xmath2 ratio . from fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is also found that @xmath53 is overestimated at lhc .",
    "since @xmath53 is mainly related to the lifetime of the source , it implies that this lifetime is also overestimated by urqmd .",
    "other calculations in @xcite show that urqmd overestimates the source lifetime by a factor of @xmath62 when compared to lhc data .",
    "the overestimation of both @xmath49 and @xmath53 can be attributed to the known fact that the pressure in the early stage is not strong enough in the cascade model calculations .",
    "a higher pressure would lead to a more explosive expansion , a stronger phase - space correlation , and a faster decoupling of the system , thus leading to smaller regions of homogeneity .",
    "for more discussion we refer the reader to @xcite . with the improved integrated boltzmann + hydrodynamics hybrid approach @xcite , where various eos of nuclear matter during the hydrodynamic evolution may be treated consistently and a decoupling supplemented by realistic 3d hypersurfaces we hope to get a satisfactory solution in the near future .",
    "to summarize , the two - pion hbt correlations ( in the lcms system ) for central pb - pb collisions at the lhc energy @xmath0 tev are calculated for the first time with the microscopic transport model urqmd .",
    "the non - gaussian effect is seen especially in both longitudinal and outward directions . both the transverse momentum @xmath34 dependence and the beam energy ( from rhic to lhc ) dependence of the hbt radii @xmath49 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 , extracted from a three dimensional gaussian fit to the correlator , exhibit qualitatively the same behaviour as found in the experiments .",
    "however , the calculated @xmath2 ratios at all @xmath34 bins are found to be larger than in the data , both at rhic & lhc .",
    "we traced this finding back to the explosive dynamics of the fireball at lhc which results in both a shorter emission duration and a stronger time - space correlation than modeled here .",
