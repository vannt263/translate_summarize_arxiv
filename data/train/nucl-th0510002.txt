    "the goal of experiments with heavy ion collisions is to study the new forms of matter which can be created under an extreme conditions at the early stage of the evolution .",
    "the bulk of hadronic observables are related , however , only to the very last period of the matter evolution - the end of the collective expansion when the system decays .",
    "our basic idea is to use the  conserved observables  which are integrals of motion ( i m ) to study the properties of the matter at the hadronization stage at different energies of a+a collisions .",
    "a structure of the i m , besides the trivial ones , depends on a scenario of the matter evolution .",
    "our analysis is based on hydrodynamic picture of the chemically frozen evolution . then the average phase - space density ( apsd ) and specific entropy ( se ) of pions as well as transverse spectra slopes and interferometry volumes",
    "are approximately conserved quantities @xcite .",
    "a conservation of the latter two quantities was found also in transport models @xcite and for the final stage of the hydrodynamic evolution in ref .",
    "the apsd and se can be expressed through the observed spectra and interferometry radii irrespectively the form of freeze - out ( isothermal ) hypersurface and transverse flows on it @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible an analysis of the hadronization stage .",
    "the method is based on the standard approach for spectra formation that supposes that thermal freeze - out in expanding locally equilibrated system happens at some space - time hypersurface with uniform temperature @xmath0 and particle number density @xmath1 . then , within this approximation which is probably appropriate in some ",
    "boost - invariant  mid - rapidity interval , @xmath2 , the locally - equilibrium phase - space density of pions , totally averaged over the hypersurface of thermal freeze - out , @xmath3 , and momentum except the longitudinal one ( rapidity is fixed , e.g. , @xmath4 ) is the same as the totally averaged phase - space density in the static homogeneous bose gas @xcite and can be extracted directly from the experimental data in full accordance with the pioneer bertsch idea @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 coincide with the inverse of the temperature and chemical potential at the freeze - out hypersurface .",
    "the @xmath9 if one ignores the resonance decays . using the same approximation of the uniform freeze - out temperature and density",
    "we get the following expression for specific entropy in mid - rapidity : @xmath10}{\\int d^{3}p\\overline{f}_{eq}}.   \\label{en - to - n}\\ ] ] the above ratio depends only on the two parameters : the temperature and chemical potential at freeze - out .",
    "the temperature can be obtained from the fit of the transverse spectra for different particle species and we will use the value @xmath11 mev as a typical `` average value '' for sps and rhic experiments .",
    "another parameter , the chemical potential , we extract from an analysis of the apsd following to ( [ result1 ] ) .",
    "the factor @xmath12 is accounting for a contribution of the short - lived resonances to the spectra and interferometry radii and absorbs also the effect of suppression of the correlation function due to the long - lived resonances @xcite .",
    "because of the chemical freeze - out a big part of pions , about a half , are produced by the short - lived resonances after thermal freeze - out . to estimate the thermal characteristics and `` conserved observables '' at the final stage of hydrodynamic evolution by means of eqs .",
    "( [ result1 ] ) , ( [ en - to - n ] ) one needs to eliminate non - thermal contributions to the pion spectra and correlation functions from resonance decays at post freeze - out stage .",
    "to do this we use the results of ref .",
    "@xcite where a study of the corresponding contributions within hydrodynamic approach gives the values of parameter @xmath13 to be @xmath14 for sps and @xmath15 for rhic , if half of pions is produced by the resonances at post freeze - out stage .",
    "then , from eq .",
    "( [ result1 ] ) one can extract the pion chemical potential at thermal freeze - out .",
    "this makes it possible to estimate the apsd , the specific entropy and other thermal parameters of the system at the end of the hydrodynamic expansion .",
    "to evaluate the apsd of negative pions by means of eq .",
    "( [ result1 ] ) we utilize the yields , transverse momentum spectra and interferometry radii of @xmath16 at mid - rapidity measured in central heavy ions collisions by the e895 and e802 collaborations for ags energies @xcite , na49 collaboration for sps cern energies @xcite , star and phenix collaborations for rhic bnl energies @xcite .",
    "since the interferometry radii are measured by phenix collaboration for @xmath17 @xmath18 centrality events at @xmath19 gev @xcite , we increase the interferometry volume measured by phenix collaboration at this c.m .",
    "energy by a factor of @xmath20 to get the interferometry volume corresponding to the most central @xmath21 @xmath18 centrality bin in accordance with @xmath22 dependence of the bertsch - pratt radius parameters found in ref .",
    "the results for the apsd at mid - rapidity for _ all _ negative pions ( @xmath9 ) at the ags , sps , rhic energies are presented in fig .",
    "the calculated apsd are mostly influenced by the values of the hbt radii in the low @xmath23 region and by the choice of analytic    ) rapidity density of entropy for negative thermal pions as function of c.m .",
    "energy per nucleon in heavy ion central collisions . ]    ) rapidity density of entropy for negative thermal pions as function of c.m .",
    "energy per nucleon in heavy ion central collisions . ]    ) rapidity density of entropy for negative thermal pions as function of c.m .",
    "energy per nucleon in heavy ion central collisions . ]    @xmath23 parameterizations behind the lower measured @xmath23 bin in accordance with the experimental data tendency , the differences there can result in significant differences in the calculated apsd values , as one can see from fig . 1 for phenix vs star data .",
    "since the part of the experimental data that we used is preliminary and was presented by the collaborations without error bars , we do not demonstrate error bars at the figures .",
    "the apsd of negative _ thermal _ pions are evaluated from the apsd of _ all _ negative pions ( @xmath14 for sps and @xmath24 for rhic energies respectively ) and are used then to extract the pion chemical potentials @xmath25 at thermal freeze - out at different sps and rhic energies , and after that to calculate the specific entropies , @xmath26 ( [ en - to - n ] ) , and the entropies , @xmath27 , of negative _ thermal _ pions . in fig .",
    "2 we present the rapidity densities , @xmath28 , of _ all _ negative pions at mid - rapidity in central nucleus - nucleus collisions for the ags , sps and rhic energies .",
    "the lines in fig .",
    "2 represent the logarithmic law of energy dependence for negative pion multiplicities : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 , @xmath31 gev ( 3 gev ) for solid ( dashed ) lines respectively .",
    "the entropies @xmath32 of negative _ thermal _ pions are demonstrated in fig .",
    "3 , where the values at the rhic energies are mean values of star and phenix data .",
    "a behavior of the pion apsd vs collision energy has a plateau at low sps energies that indicates , apparently , the transformation of initial energy to non - hadronic forms of matter at sps ; a saturation of that quantity at the rhic energies can be treated as an existence of the limiting hagedorn temperature of hadronic matter , or maximal temperature of deconfinement @xmath33 . a behavior of the entropy of thermal pions and measured pion multiplicities in central rapidity region vs energy demonstrates an anomalously high slope of an increase of the pion entropy / multiplicities at sps energies compared to what takes place at the ags and rhic energies .",
    "this additional growth could be , probably , a manifestation of the qcd critical end point ( cep ) .",
    "the observed phenomenon can be caused by the dissipative effects that usually accompany phase transitions , such as an increase of the bulk viscosity @xcite , and also by peculiarities of pionic decays of @xmath34 mesons and other resonances with masses that are reduced , as compare to its vacuum values , in vicinity of the qcd cep @xcite . at the rhic energies there is no anomalous rise of pion entropy / multiplicities , apparently , because the crossover transition takes place far from the cep and no additional degrees of freedom appear at that scale of energies : quarks and gluons were liberated at previous energy scale .",
