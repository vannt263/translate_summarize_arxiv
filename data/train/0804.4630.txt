    "it is in this role as a _",
    "dynamical tracer _ of the galactic disk that the present study of open clusters is especially focused .",
    "star clusters can be effective tracers of the galactic disk because they offer many advantages over other tracer candidates .",
    "first , relative to other tracers , star clusters lend themselves more amenably to age , metallicity , distance , and velocity evaluation .",
    "compared to an isolated field star at the same location in the galaxy , these quantities are much easier to establish in a star cluster , needing only a properly interpreted color - magnitude diagram to establish the first three , while velocities can also be better determined for a star cluster because : ( 1 ) averaging radial velocity and proper motion data over an ensemble of co - moving stars confers potentially as much as a @xmath1 increase in precision for the bulk motion of the ensemble , and ( 2 ) better distances allow one to translate proper motions into transverse velocities more accurately .",
    "the supplemental knowledge of age and metallicity of a source confers additional beneficial insights into its proper use as a dynamical tracer with respect to , for example , assumptions about orbit shape and asymmetric drift .",
    "alternatively , one can explore galactic dynamics as a function of population age and metallicity if all relevant data are available .",
    "on the other hand , there are some complications in the use of open clusters as dynamical tracers .",
    "the challenge of proper identification of cluster members can present particular hazards .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the ucac stars used by @xcite to establish the proper motions of at least two particular clusters  be29 and bh176  in their exhaustive survey of over 400 systems are too bright and can not be part of these distant systems .",
    "difficulties caused by inaccurate membership censuses are why continued large - scale observational efforts are needed before we can be confident in the use of open clusters as galactic disk tracers , particularly for more sparse and more distant systems .    to overcome these types of problems , which are typically associated with small number statistics ,",
    "it is desirable to survey large numbers of potential open cluster members .",
    "however , this desire to achieve the largest possible statistical samples often encourages a dangerous reliance on compilations of disparate data .",
    "for example the dynamical study of the galactic disk using open clusters by @xcite found that in their compilation of data from the literature @xmath2% of the clusters with multiple distance measurements had differences greater than one magnitude in determined distance modulus and @xmath2% of the clusters also had poor rv qualities .    to help overcome both the membership and homogeneity problems that are often a hindrance to the use of open clusters as tracers of the galactic disk",
    ", we present a new survey of open clusters that will not only take advantage of quality radial velocities to help discriminate cluster members , but also rely on one source of data as much as possible for each independent cluster parameter ( e.g. , all photometry from one source , all rvs and derived in a uniform manner , all proper motions coming from one catalog , etc . ) .",
    "a central objective of this study is the use of these clusters to derive global dynamical properties of the milky way disk , with a particular emphasis on the derivation of the full space velocities for the target clusters . in keeping with our philosophy of uniformity of data , and because large numbers of proper motions presently must come from all - sky astrometric surveys , we first investigate the main proper motion catalogs available for investigations of open cluster kinematics and from which we might draw an initial target sample .",
    "a key advance that has propelled a resurgence in the use of open clusters as disk dynamical tracers is the compilation of all - sky proper motion surveys .",
    "there have been four surveys to determine bulk galactic cluster kinematics by averaging the proper motions of presumed cluster stars based on data from the hipparcos @xcite , tycho-2 @xcite , four million star ( 4 m ) @xcite , and recently the ucac-2 @xcite catalogs .",
    "the esa hipparcos mission has provided critical astrometry for two of these proper motion databases via each of hipparcos primary data products : ( 1 ) the hipparcos catalog of @xmath3 stars ( @xmath4 ) with proper motion uncertainties of 12 mas yr@xmath5 and ( 2 ) the tycho-2 catalog of 2.5 million stars ( @xmath6 ) with proper motion uncertainties of 13 mas yr@xmath5 .",
    "the ucac-2 catalog of 48 million stars is based on tycho-2 and fainter , ground based observations ( to @xmath7 ) and has proper motion uncertainties of 17 mas yr@xmath5 .",
    "the 4 m catalog @xcite was compiled from the astrographic catalog and the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "guide star catalog ( gsc ) reduced to the older system of the ppm @xcite survey , with proper motion uncertainties of @xmath8 mas yr@xmath5 .",
    "proper motions for hundreds of open clusters have been published using these catalogs . however , a comparison of the derived motions for the clusters in common between surveys reveals substantial discrepancies , as shown in figure [ pmvpm ] , where a cluster by cluster comparison of the proper motion differences is illustrated , namely for ( a ) tycho-2 versus hipparcos , ( b ) tycho-2 versus 4 m , ( c ) 4 m versus hipparcos , and ( d ) tycho-2 versus ucac-2 . as may be seen ,",
    "differences in derived proper motions typically exceed the quoted uncertainties claimed by each survey .",
    "the best correlation of derived proper motions is between surveys using the tycho-2 and hipparcos astrometry ; remaining differences in derived mean cluster proper motions between these surveys must therefore be due to differences in the adopted samples of presumed cluster members because the actual proper motions , at least for @xmath9 , are the same ( i.e. hipparcos - based ) , while the tycho-2 astrometry used at fainter magnitudes is on the hipparcos reference system ( which means that the system is referenced to background , extra - galactic sources of the international celestial reference system ) . of course",
    ", with its bright magnitude limit , hipparcos can usually provide useful astrometry for only a small number of stars per cluster ( typically less than four ) . with only a few stars per cluster ,",
    "a hipparcos - based survey is far more susceptible to small number statistics as well as the misidentification of true cluster members against the large number of fore / background stars of the galactic disk .",
    "clearly tycho-2 and hipparcos , which are currently the most accurate all - sky astrometric surveys , must be considered primary and important sources of proper motion data for our survey . on the other hand",
    ", deeper catalogs can provide more cluster members , but typically with worse precision .",
    "thus , it is not immediately obvious that adding additional data from the deeper proper motion catalogs improves or degrades those from tycho-2 and hipparcos alone .",
    "a reasonable correlation of derived cluster motions is found when either the tycho-2 and ucac-2 catalog data are used with a @xmath10 limit , but this is because ucac-2 adopts tycho-2 proper motions for stars brighter than about @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , it is clear that there are greater deviations in derived proper motions when we incorporate the fainter stars from ucac-2 . apart from not knowing whether these differences reflect systematic problems in the fainter ucac catalog ( which allows probing of proper motions with stars to @xmath12 ) or small number statistics in the brighter surveys , some additional concerns about ucac beyond those suggested by figure [ pmvpm ]",
    "have led us to not adopt this dataset for our own work .",
    "for example , as recently pointed out in @xcite , the ucac-2 proper motions may have systematic trends with magnitude due to the compiled nature of the ucac-2 survey ( i.e. , ground based proper motions are added to tycho-2 data ) .",
    "this concern is usefully illustrated by looking at the cluster m67 ( ngc 2682 ) .",
    "in figure [ ucacm67]a , we show the 2mass color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) for the m67 field plotting only the most probable members based on cmd location .",
    "we split the cmd ( red : ucac mag @xmath13 , blue : ucac mag @xmath14 ) at a magnitude that represents approximately the transition within the catalog from tycho-2 to ground - based observations .",
    "substantial proper motion shifts are apparent between the bright and faint samples ( figure [ ucacm67]b ) , and this suggests significant systematic zero - point offsets within the ucac-2 database .    the 4 m catalog , as well , appears to have systematic proper motion errors .",
    "the 4 m is not tied to the hipparcos system , but rather to the ppm @xcite .",
    "@xcite have used the 4 m catalog to determine the proper motions of about 200 open clusters .",
    "@xcite compared their tycho-2 open cluster proper motions to both those based on hipparcos @xcite and the glushkova et al .",
    "4 m work and found that the 4 m motions were systematically offset from those in the hipparcos system by @xmath15 mas yr@xmath5 in both @xmath16 and @xmath17 , an amount that was larger than expected given the quoted errors of both the surveys . while these differences likely reflect both differences in membership as well as astrometric accuracy , this comparison suggests that the deeper proper motions are not necessarily providing better overall accuracy in the open cluster bulk motions , and recommends a strategy based on quality over quantity of cluster star motions .    therefore , because of uncertainty over the reliability of the ucac-2 and 4 m surveys and our desire to adhere to a `` quality over quantity '' policy , we have elected to focus on deriving bulk motions using astrometry from the tycho-2 catalog , but with dedication to ensuring that we derive a trustworthy membership of the smaller number of available cluster stars available in this shallower database .",
    "the mass and mass distribution of the galactic disk has been a matter of debate for over a century , and will likely remain so until extremely precise proper motions and trigonometric parallaxes can be obtained for numerous disk tracers , most likely through future space - based studies like the national aeronautics and space administration s ( nasa ) _ space interferometry mission _",
    "( sim planetquest ) and the european space agency s ( esa ) _ gaia _ satellites .",
    "the new project presented here represents both a preparatory effort in this space - based direction as well as a standalone dynamical study in its own rite .",
    "our goal is to establish a well - constructed , well - studied , baseline tracer population  open clusters  that can not only ( 1 ) serve as input targets for galactic dynamics studies with sim planetquest ( specifically , for the sim key project _ taking measure of the milky way _ , for which srm is the principal investigator and which has provided support for this project ) , but which ( 2 ) can also be immediately exploited for understanding galactic dynamics with existing astrometric data .    as mentioned above , the inability to establish a uniform",
    ", unbiased tracer sample has been one of the key weaknesses of previous galactic dynamical surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to provide a homogeneous set of tracers ,",
    "we have undertaken a spectroscopic survey to obtain precision rvs of open cluster fields .",
    "these rvs will establish cluster membership for individual stars that not only provides a very precise mean rv of each cluster , but , in identifying cluster members having accurate astrometry , can be used to define the bulk cluster proper motion .",
    "the combination of the newly found , very precise mean rv of each cluster with its derived bulk proper motion and distance will allow us to determine the space velocities of these clusters . with a large number of cluster space velocities , the rotation curve of the galactic disk",
    "can be constrained over the @xmath18 range of the sample .",
    "alternatively , through the adoption of an assumed rotation curve ( i.e. , galactic potential ) , the orbital properties of individual clusters can be determined .",
    "because we are interested in obtaining results before sim planetquest and gaia are in service , our rv study will focus on clusters already having available , uniform and reliable proper motions .",
    "as described in  1.4 , we have elected to focus on the all - sky tycho-2 proper motion catalog , which provides useful astrometry for typically 50200 stars per cluster field ( @xmath19 deg@xmath20 ) .",
    "while selection of tycho-2 as our source of proper motions limits the depth and thereby the cluster distance that can be explored , it is in keeping with our philosophy of quality over quantity for the astrometric data .",
    "the selected proper motion stars for a given cluster field can usually be investigated spectroscopically with a single pointing of the noao hydra multi - fiber spectrographs on the ctio 4-meter and wiyn 3.5-meter telescopes , and the radial velocities derived from these spectroscopic data are the primary results presented here .",
    "our campaign of multi - fiber spectroscopy allows us to check virtually every star in a cluster field having a tycho-2 proper motion , and leaves additional fibers to ( 1 ) expand the rv membership census to fainter stars in anticipation of the future astrometric surveys ( e.g. , sim and gaia ) , and ( 2 ) improve age - dating of the clusters through cmd - isochrone fitting to established member stars .",
    "the current study of clusters provides a large uniform database for further open cluster research , as a supplement to the @xcite and webda @xcite databases .",
    "the new rvs immediately improve all previous proper motion work on our targeted clusters because of the clarity they bring regarding cluster membership .",
    "the improved rvs and proper motions , when combined with new distances we shall derive elsewhere ( paper ii ) , will provide much more reliable space motions of numerous open clusters over a large @xmath18 range ; these space velocities will be at a precision sufficient to make tangible improvements in the determination of the nearby galactic rotation curve and , in turn , the mass distribution of the galactic disk . with uncertainties of order @xmath21 km s@xmath5 ,",
    "the data here yield the best derived bulk rvs thus far for most of the chosen clusters , this precision is comparable to the uncertainties in transverse velocity that sim and gaia will measure for these clusters , and represent a significant improvement over many previous rv surveys of open clusters , which have typical uncertainties of order @xmath22 km s@xmath5 @xcite",
    ". our results are more comparable to the rv precisions being obtained for open cluster stars in studies using coravel ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for example .    following the work in this contribution ( paper i ) , we will provide uniformly - determined distances and ages derived from isochrone - fitting to 2mass photometry of these clusters , aided by the cluster membership data derived here ( paper ii ) . with newly - derived kinematics and distances in hand from papers",
    "i & ii , we will then use the cluster sample to explore not only the orbital characteristics of the individual clusters ( paper iii ) , but global properties of the galactic disk ( paper iv ) , including : ( 1 ) the local galactic rotation curve and velocity field near the sun , ( 2 ) the kinematics of the disk across the frontier separating @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and ( 3 ) the validity of the assumption of galactic dynamical symmetry ( e.g. , north vs.  south , galactic quadrants i / ii vs. iv / iii ) .    in  6 and table 12 of this paper we present the derived 3d space motions of the clusters that enable these future contributions . in the preceding sections of this paper",
    "we explain how we selected our target clusters (  2.1 and  4 ) and which stars within each cluster field to probe (  2.2 ) , the spectroscopic observations and the derivation of radial velocities (  3 ) , and the means by which membership within each cluster is established (  5 ) .",
    "our selection of specific open clusters starts with the 205 clusters explored in the @xcite catalogs , which derive cluster membership using the statistical method of @xcite .",
    "we also adopt the following criteria : ( 1 ) the clusters must have at least ten stars with tycho-2 proper motions in the fields selected by @xcite , and ( 2 ) the cluster diameters can not be much larger than the hydra field of view ( 40 ctio , 60 wiyn ) so that the cluster can be sampled with a significant number of fibers .",
    "in addition , to obtain the greatest leverage on the local galactic rotation curve the selected clusters span a wide area over the galactic @xmath25-@xmath26 plane and reach to a heliocentric distance of @xmath272.5 kpc .",
    "neither age , distance from the galactic plane , nor metallicity was considered as a selection criterion .",
    "table [ cltargets ] shows the basic cluster parameters of our sample with data taken from the @xcite catalog , including coordinates of right ascension and declination ( cols . 2 and 3 ) and galactic longitude and latitude ( cols . 4 and 5 ) , heliocentric distance ( col .",
    "6 ) , @xmath28 and visual diameter of the cluster in arcminutes ( cols . 7 and 8) , and the observing run on which the cluster was observed ( see below and table [ crvsv ] for definitions ) .",
    "the galactic distribution of our final cluster sample of 71 clusters is shown in figure [ charplot ] .",
    "the smaller number of clusters we have sampled in the @xmath29180  half of the galaxy is result of a smaller amount of observing time obtained for the wiyn observations ; however future work in the research program will aim to remedy this deficiency .",
    "figure [ charplot ] also shows the distribution of the selected cluster ages and distances from the galactic midplane as a function of their galactic radius ( assuming the sun is at 8.5 kpc ) .",
    "more than half of our final sample have ages less than 200 myr but older than 10 myr ( table 1 ) .",
    "the large number of relatively young clusters is important for kinematical studies of the galactic disk because , in general , open clusters should develop increasing deviations from `` normal '' disk rotation due to the scattering by molecular clouds over time @xcite ; however , clusters that are _ too _ young may still reflect the specific dynamical environment of their birth and may not yet have circular orbits @xcite .",
    "figure [ charplot]c shows that all clusters in our sample are within 500 pc of the galactic plane , and most are within 200 pc .",
    "this supports the notion that most clusters in our sample are likely to be `` well behaved '' in the sense that they have not been scattered far from the galactic midplane and therefore are likely to still be on near - circular orbits ( of course , we will revisit this question when we examine cluster orbits in detail , in a future contribution ) .",
    "less than 25% of our clusters have estimated metallicities ( [ fe / h ] ) , so we have little leverage on this aspect of our sample ; however , we hope to derive metallicity estimates for some of our clusters in the future , using not only improved isochrone fits to cmds aided with our membership data , but the spectra themselves .      given that bulk 3d motions are our primary goal , the first stellar targets within each cluster selected for observation were those hipparcos and tycho-2 stars used in the @xcite survey for the clusters . because constraints on fiber optic placement with the hydra instrument ( i.e. , two fibers can not be closer than 25  in the hydra setup ) mean that in some cases not all desired stars can be observed in a cluster field , we must prioritize stars within a fiber setup .",
    "for this reason , stars were ranked in priority order based on the @xcite derived membership probabilities , from highest to lowest probability .",
    "@xcite derived these probabilities based on the proper motions using the method of @xcite .",
    "next , additional tycho-2 stars available in the hydra field of view , but not used in the @xcite study ( because they lie beyond the cluster radius studied by these authors ) were added as the next priority to the target list . for the wiyn / hydra runs , no targets beyond the tycho-2 stars needed to be selected because the combination of a smaller number of available hydra fibers ( 90 vs. 132 for ctio / hydra ) and larger field of view ( 60  vs. 40  for ctio / hydra ) typically meant that nearly all target fibers were filled with tycho-2 stars .",
    "for the ctio runs and for fields having less than 50 stars with available tycho-2 proper motion data , we selected at lowest priority two additional sets of stars ; first , stars between @xmath3015 magnitude from the usno - b1.0 catalog from within the cluster radius ( with that value taken from the dias et al .  2002b catalog ) , with the goal of searching for additional cluster members fainter than the @xmath31 magnitude limit of the tycho-2 survey , and second , we allowed unused `` field orientation probe stars '' ( fops ; usno b1.0 stars with @xmath32 ) to be added to the bottom of the target priority list . at either wiyn or ctio , fibers that were not assigned to targets",
    "were used for sky observations , with at least six ( wiyn ) or ten ( ctio ) fibers positioned on random sky for sky subtraction of the stellar spectra .",
    "we have collected homogeneous spectroscopic observations for 71 open clusters using the hydra multi - fiber spectrographs on the blanco 4-m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) and the 3.5-m wiyn telescope at kitt peak national observatory ( kpno ) .",
    "this project was conducted using publicly competed noao time and was granted long - term status , which permitted observations in the semesters 2002a2004a over a total of fourteen awarded ctio 4-m and six wiyn 3.5-m nights .",
    "the data for the clusters listed in table [ cltargets ] were obtained the nights of ut 2002 march 812 ( `` run 1 '' ) , 2003 march 1621 ( `` run 2 '' ) , 2003 july 2023 ( `` run 3 '' ) , and 2003 august 28 ( `` run 4 '' ) from ctio . for more efficient observing ,",
    "some cluster observations scheduled for two august 2003 ctio nights were interspersed with other targets for two other observing projects awarded telescope time over the course of eleven ctio / hydra nights in july and august 2003 ( runs 3 and 4 ) .",
    "the wiyn data were observed on the nights of 2003 september 1418 ( `` run 5 '' ) .",
    "the ctio observations made use of 132 hydra fibers that are simultaneously dispersed onto a @xmath33 pixel , site400 mm ccd using the 380 grating with 1200 lines mm@xmath5 and with the fiber ends viewed by the spectrograph through the 100@xmath34 m slit plate to improve the resolution to a dispersion of 0.68   per resolution element ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the spectral range covered was 77408740  .",
    "data obtained at wiyn dispersed the 90 hydra fibers dispersed onto a @xmath36 pixel ccd in the red bench camera using the echelle ( 316@63.4 ) grating in 6th order ; this yielded a dispersion of 0.82   per resolution element ( @xmath37 ) which was centered on the 82208800    spectral range . typical signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath38 ) of 10 or better were obtained ; all cluster stars presented have at least @xmath39 . to aid the rv calibration , multiple rv standards",
    "were observed on each run , where each `` observation '' of an rv standard entails sending the light of the calibrator down 2 - 12 different fibers , yielding many dozen individual spectra of each rv standard .",

    "after basic processing the data were run through the @xmath40 routine dohydra .",
    "one dimensional spectra for each star were extracted from the two - dimensional ccd images and wavelength calibrated with respect to a comparison lamp spectrum .",
    "exposures of the penray ( ctio ; he , ne , ar , and xe ) or cuar ( wiyn ) lamps were taken at each hydra pointing through all fibers to provide comparison spectra yielding at least  11 prominent emission lines roughly evenly distributed over the observed wavelength range .",
    "these comparison spectra provide a wavelength solution ( i.e. , pixel to wavelength conversion ) for each extracted object spectrum .",
    "all radial velocities were derived using iraf s fxcor package , which we used first to determine rvs for the standard stars .",
    "radial velocity standard stars are used to check for systematics in the data , to determine the measured rv precision , and to calibrate the zero - point of the velocity scale .",
    "the reduction to radial velocities employed essentially the classical cross - correlation methodology of @xcite .",
    "the template star input to the correlator is prepared from a high signal - to - noise ( @xmath38 ) standard star spectrum from which the stellar continuum is fitted and subtracted .",
    "the resulting spectrum is high and low pass fourier - filtered to remove both high frequency noise ( e.g. , cosmic rays ) and the low frequency variation cause by difference in instrument throughput .",
    "we first measured the rvs of standard stars by cross - correlating each fourier - filtered standard star spectrum against every other standard star spectrum from its corresponding observing run over the restricted wavelength range of 82208680  , which avoided possible contamination from nearby atmospheric lines .",
    "the resulting rvs from different cross - correlations for each individual standard star spectrum were averaged and the standard deviations measured ; the results are presented in table [ rvstdindiv ] . the average velocity standard deviation for the individual hydra",
    "standard star spectra is @xmath41 km s@xmath5 for spectra with @xmath42 .",
    "we determined the level of the random and any unknown systematic rv errors from a prescription described in @xcite , which is based on the analysis of repeatedly observed stars ( table [ rvstdindiv ] ) . in this case",
    "these stars were typically observed through different hydra fibers . the tonry ",
    "davis ratio ( tdr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for each spectrum is measured using fxcor .",
    "since the tdr scales approximately with @xmath38 we can , following the method described in @xcite , determine approximate 1@xmath43 errors in the rvs corresponding to a given tdr as : @xmath44 the parameter @xmath45 is a constant calibrated by the standard star data using the following formula , which is predicated on the assumption that the tdr is a good measure of the relative @xmath38 , and where autocorrelations are not included : @xmath46 where @xmath47 is @xmath48th observation of the @xmath49th standard star , and @xmath50 is the mean rv of the @xmath49th standard star .",
    "we obtained the values of @xmath51 for our sample s number of degrees of freedom , where @xmath52 is the critical value of the @xmath53 distribution at the 50% confidence level multiplied by @xmath54 degrees of freedom , as described fully in @xcite .",
    "since our target stars were selected based on proper motion criteria , they span a wide range of spectral types , including anything from hot o and be stars to cool carbon stars . as a result , we observed a range of rv standard star templates .",
    "however , due to the lack of international astronomical union ( iau ) rv standards hotter than spectral type a0 , we used b and a stars from @xcite to provide rv standards for our hot star spectra . for a better match in the spectral types between targets and cross - correlation templates , we divided the observed standard stars into `` red '' or `` blue '' subsamples for our cross - correlation templates .",
    "stars were considered `` red '' stars if the infrared triplet ( 8498 , 8542 , and 8662 ) was present in the spectra ; this encompasses cool f through early m type stars .",
    "`` blue '' stars have dominant paschen series lines and virtually no triplet ( i.e. , o through a type stars ) .",
    "initially we anticipated using primarily late type stars for our analysis , so that in the earlier runs ( march 2002 , march 2003 and july 2003 observations ; table [ cltargets ]  runs 1 , 2 , 3 ) we did not obtain `` blue '' standards .",
    "later it became clear that good rvs for hotter stars could be derived and we began to collect blue standards . to cover the lack of blue standards in the earlier runs , the `` blue '' august 2003 standards were used to reduce all ctio `` blue '' target stars .",
    "this approach was adopted and found to work moderately well because even across observing runs all spectra were taken with the same instrument setup , are dispersion corrected uniformly , and should experience no flexure problems because hydra uses a bench - mounted spectrograph . in the end",
    "we did find some offsets in the rv zero - points for some of the runs  but , ironically these were for the runs where we actually did take blue standards ( see sections 3.6 and 3.7 ) .",
    "the standard star spectra ( table [ rvstdindiv ] ) provide a data set for calibration of the rv errors for each run according to equations 1 and 2 .",

    ", we find the parameters given in table [ crvsv ] , which are used to determine errors for each of the runs .",
    "the variation in the @xmath45 values can be due to the effects of focus and small spectrograph setup variations .      to check the reliability of our measurements of radial velocity standard stars , we compare the difference between our measurements ( table [ rvstdall ] ) and the iau or @xcite values , as shown in figure [ rvcompiauplot ] .",

    "large numbers of disk stars unrelated to the cluster lie along the cmd sequences of the typical open cluster and , given the typical motions of many objects within the galactic plane , usually with rather similar velocities .",
    "to determine the bulk motion of clusters one must first isolate true cluster members from the dominant field star population in the fore / background . to accomplish this discrimination",
    "we have modified a previously implemented method designed to do just that .",
    "the star s proper motion , rv , and spatial distribution are all used as inputs for a kernel - based , probability distribution function technique , described below , that eventually allows the cluster bulk motion to be determined from stars with high membership probabilities .      to determine cluster membership probabilities for stars based on rv and proper motion ,",
    "we have chosen to use an empirical , non - parametric technique  modified from that described in @xcite  that incorporates a kernel estimator @xcite to isolate the phase space distribution of cluster stars in a field .",
    "while we adopt the basic technique used by @xcite for proper motions alone , we have generalized it also to operate on a spatially - constrained , 1-d rv distribution as well as an rv - constrained , 2-d proper motion distribution . in principle , one could use either distribution separately for culling cluster members , but for the most secure assessment of membership we depend on the joint probability distributions .",
    "this means , therefore , that we can only use stars having both rv and proper motion data . to improve our results further ,",
    "we remove stars with large measurement errors in either proper motion or rv , or those stars that clearly have halo - like rvs , using the following constraints applied to the data :    * @xmath34 error limit : @xmath66 mas yr@xmath5 * rv limit : @xmath67 km s@xmath5 * rv error limit : @xmath68 km s@xmath5    the modified version of the @xcite formulation is intended to perform better for our particular survey circumstances  i.e. , fewer numbers of stars per cluster , but high - quality rv data for these stars . throughout the following description",
    "we will demonstrate the basic features of our analysis via the example processing of the cluster ngc 2682 ( m67 ) , for which the raw data are shown in figure [ rawm67 ] .      for our data ,",
    "the rv distribution is found to be the most sensitive discriminator of cluster membership because of the small measured relative rv errors .",
    "when applying a kernel density estimator the empirical density function ( @xmath69 ) is comprised of both the cluster ( @xmath70 ) and the field ( @xmath71 ) , where here @xmath72 stands for the rv distribution . since the observed empirical density function is the sum of two underlying distributions ( e.g. , @xmath73 ) , one must decompose the distributions to isolate the cluster function . because of the accuracy of the rv data and the small intrinsic velocity dispersions of open clusters ( 0.53 km s@xmath5 ) , we expect to be able to discriminate the cluster and field fairly readily .",
    "to do so , however we must first isolate the field population to verify which peak in the @xmath69 distribution is due to the cluster .",
    "differences in the cluster versus field distribution should be evident by looking at samples of stars drawn from different radii from the cluster center .",
    "a useful initial assumption is that stars outside of the cluster radius are `` non - members '' , and these can provide a reasonable estimate of @xmath74 .",
    "the rv data kernel analysis is comprised of four steps : ( 1 ) all rv data are convolved with a gaussian kernel to homogenize our errors for a given cluster .",
    "this kernel has a width determined by the mean rv errors from all of the observed stars in a given cluster field . because open clusters have intrinsic velocity dispersions of 13 km s@xmath5 in addition to our measurement errors , we limit the gaussian width to be _ at least _ 3 km s@xmath5 and at most 10 km s@xmath5 .",
    "applying the gaussian kernel to smooth our rv data ( @xmath69 ) produces the smoothed field plus cluster distribution @xmath75 ; an example for ngc 2682 ( m67 ) is shown in figure [ rvm67]a .",

    "( 4 ) we assume that the strongest peak in the `` cluster '' probability distribution , @xmath79 , belongs to the cluster , and perform a 1-d gaussian fit to this peak ( figure [ rvm67]d ; dotted line ) .",
    "this gaussian fit is used to determine rv membership probabilities , @xmath80 , for all stars in the field and to exclude non - member rvs that still may appear in @xmath81 .      the proper motion kernel analysis",
    "is similarly comprised of four steps , but now applied in 2-d .",
    "this technique for proper motions is identical to that used in @xcite with the exception that instead of using a spatial membership separation ( which we used for the rv distribution described above ) to establish @xmath82 , we have chosen to use the rv separation described above ( i.e. , those stars outside the gaussian fit to the rv distribution , @xmath83 , are considered the `` field '' population ) .",
    "the proper motion kernel uses the following equation analogous to that used in the rv analysis above : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is @xmath86 .",
    "continuing our example of ngc 2682 , we apply the 2-d kernel smoothing to the proper motion distribution as shown in figure [ pmm67]a - d .",

    "we argue that given our more restrictive 3d membership criteria that ours is superior , though further study will be needed to confirm this assertion .",
    "thus , while tycho-2 has the best currently available astrometric data , more strict rv discrimination such as we provide can substantially improve the application of these data for determining cluster motions , given a sufficient number of rv members .",
    "we have derived high precision ( typically @xmath105 km s@xmath5 uncertainties ) radial velocities for 3436 stars in the fields of 71 open clusters within 3 kpc of the sun .",
