    "the only known way to obtain direct experimental information on the space - time structure of the particle emitting source created in a relativistic nuclear collision is through two - particle intensity ( hanbury - brown  twiss ( hbt ) ) interferometry @xcite .",
    "the goal of this method is to extract the _ space - time _ structure of the source from _ momentum spectra _ which are the only measurable quantities , making use of the quantum statistical correlations between pairs of identical particles .",
    "this information is crucial for an assessment of theoretical models which try to extract the energy density of the source from the measured single particle spectra and particle multiplicity densities in momentum space .",
    "reliable estimates of the source volume and the energy density are , on the other hand , indispensable for an experimental proof that high energy collisions can successfully generate large volumes of matter with extreme energy density , where a transition into deconfined quark matter might be possible .    for many years hbt",
    "interferometry of hadron - hadron and nucleus - nucleus collisions was motivated by the naive expectation , based on the experience with photon interferometry for stars , that the width of the two - particle correlation function in the relative momentum directly measures the geometric size of the source .",
    "this expectation is _",
    "wrong_. unlike stars in the universe , the sources created in hadronic or heavy - ion collisions may feature inhomogeneous temperature profiles and strong collective dynamical expansion .",
    "we now know @xcite that for such sources the hbt radius parameters generally do nt measure the full source size , but only so - called  space - time regions of homogeneity \" @xcite inside which the momentum distribution varies sufficiently little so that the particles can actually show the quantum statistical correlations .",
    "the size of these homogeneity regions varies with the momentum of the emitted particles , causing a dependence of the hbt parameters on the pair momentum @xcite .",
    "the detailed momentum dependence is , however , model - dependent , and in general it is not simple @xcite .",
    "the extraction of the strength of the collective flow from hbt data is further complicated by significant resonance decay contributions which also induce a momentum dependence of the hbt radius parameters and of the so - called  incoherence parameter \" @xcite .",
    "the finite lifetime of the sources created in nuclear collisions leads to another complication : the hbt radius parameters generally mix the spatial and temporal aspects of the source extension in a non - trivial and reference frame dependent way , in particular if at the same time the source undergoes collective expansion .",
    "the origin and pattern of this mixing was clarified in a recent series of publications from the regensburg group @xcite .",
    "two major new results have resulted from this work : ( i ) the discovery @xcite of a new cross term in the two - particle correlation function mixing the outward and longitudinal components of the relative momentum between the two particles , and ( ii ) the new ykp ( yano - koonin - podgoretski ) parametrisation of the correlation function @xcite .",
    "the latter permits the experimental determination of the longitudinal velocity of the source volume element where most of the particle pairs originate ( as a function of the pair momentum ) and achieves a nearly perfect factorization of the longitudinal , transverse and temporal homogeneity regions of the source ( again as functions of the pair momentum ) in the source rest frame .",
    "furthermore it provides for a clean separation of the longitudinal and transverse dynamics of the source .    in this talk",
    "i review these new theoretical developments and exemplify them for a class of simple model emission functions for thermalized sources with collective transverse and longitudinal expansion and finite space - time geometry .",
    "the single and two particle spectra are defined as @xmath0 in terms of creation and destruction operators for on - shell particles with momenta @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes an average over the source ensemble . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are normalized to the average number of particles @xmath5 and pairs @xmath6 per event , respectively .",
    "the two - particle correlation function is defined as @xmath7 for uncorrelated emission and in the absence of final state interactions @xcite one can prove @xcite a generalized wick theorem for the factorisation of the 2-particle spectrum ( [ spectra2 ] ) and obtains @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the relative and total momentum of the particle pair , and the positive ( negative ) sign applies for bosons ( fermions ) .",

    "( this implies @xmath22 . )",
    "the approximation consists of replacing the single particle spectra at @xmath23 and @xmath24 in the denominator by the spectrum at @xmath20 ; it is exact for exponential momentum spectra and a good approximation in practice @xcite .",
    "the second equality in ( [ double ] ) defines a ( @xmath14-dependent ) average over the emission function of which we will make abundant use below .",
    "a useful feature is that in ( [ double ] ) the emission function can be to very good approximation @xcite evaluated at @xmath25 , i.e. on the classical energy shell , since the typical source radii are larger than the compton wavelengths of the observed hadrons .",
    "this warrants the replacement of the wigner density @xmath11 by a classical phase - space distribution in practical calculations .    due to the on - shell constraint @xmath26 the four components of @xmath27",
    "are not independent , but related by @xmath28 the fourier transform in ( [ double ] ) is therefore not invertible , and the reconstruction of the space - time structure of the source from hbt measurements will thus always require additional model assumptions . furthermore , inserting ( [ massshell ] ) into ( [ double ] ) , @xmath29 , we see that the correlator @xmath30 mixes the spatial and temporal information in a non - trivial way which depends on the pair velocity @xmath31 . only for time - independent sources things",

    "there it induces a weak @xmath108-dependence at small @xmath108 even in the absence of transverse flow ; at @xmath154 mev the contribution of the @xmath153 dies out , and @xmath104 again becomes @xmath108-independent ( which would not be the case if it were affected by flow ) . at @xmath150 and",

    " @xmath105 shows some effects from the additional lifetime of the resonances , in particular from the long - lived @xmath153 .",
    "resonances with much longer lifetimes than the @xmath153 ( in particular all weak decays ) have no effect on the radii , because their contribution to the correlator is only at very small values of @xmath27 which can not be resolved experimentally .",
    "they lead to a reduced `` incoherence parameter '' @xmath155 @xcite . since for increasing @xmath108 the resonance contributions decrease , the @xmath155-parameter increases with @xmath108 , approaching 1 as @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "a detailed study will follow @xcite .",
    "the weak effect of resonances on @xmath157 seems surprising : due to their non - zero lifetime they should be able to propagate outside the original source before decay and form a pion `` halo '' @xcite .",
    "this effect is , however , much weaker than naively expected : most of the resonances are not very fast , and the halo thickness is thus only a fraction of the resonance lifetime . at finite transverse flow an additional effect comes into play : it turns out that then the effective size of the emission function for directly emitted resonances is _ smaller _ than that for direct pions @xcite ! at @xmath158 and 0.6 this even slightly overcompensates the halo effect , and altogether the resonances change neither the size nor the @xmath108-dependence of @xmath104 .",
    "the model - independent expressions of secs .  [ sec2 ] and [ sec4 ] for",
    "the hbt width parameters in terms of second order variances of the emission function provide the basis of a detailed physical interpretation of the measured hbt radii .",
    "they show that the hbt radius parameters do not necessarily measure the full geometric extension of the source , but regions of homogeneity in the effective emission function for particles with certain fixed momenta . for expanding systems these are usually smaller than the naive geometric source size and decreasing functions of the pair momentum . for systems with finite lifetime",
    "the hbt parameters usually mix the spatial and temporal structure of the source , and their unfolding requires model studies .    with the new ykp parametrization we have found a method which , for systems with dominant longitudinal expansion , cleanly factorises the longitudinal and transverse spatial from the temporal homogeneity length .",
    "the effective source lifetime is directly fitted by the parameter @xmath84 ; it is generically a function of the pair momentum and largest for pairs which are slow in the cms .",
    "another fit parameter , the yk velocity , measures directly the longitudinal velocity of the emitting fluid element , and its dependence on the pair rapidity allows for a direct determination of the longitudinal expansion of the source . without transverse expansion ,",
    "the ykp radius parameters show exact @xmath108-scaling .",
    "the breaking of this scaling and the @xmath108-dependence of the transverse radius parameter @xmath82 allow for a determination of the transverse expansion velocity of the source .",
    "resonance decays were shown to mostly affect the lifetime parameter and leave the @xmath108-dependence of @xmath82 nearly unchanged .",
    "they thus do not endanger the extraction of the transverse flow via hbt .      with this new and detailed understanding of the method",
    ", i believe that hbt interferometry has a begun a new and vigorous life as a powerful tool for reconstructing the geometric and dynamic space - time characteristics of the collision zone from the measured momentum spectra .",
