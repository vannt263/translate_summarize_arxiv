    "neutrino oscillation experiments involving neutrinos and antineutrinos coming from astrophysical and terrestrial sources have found compelling evidence that neutrinos have finite but small masses . to accommodate this observation , the minimal standard model ( sm ) must be extended . generating neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism  @xcite is among the most attractive ones .",
    "it explains the smallness of neutrino mass by supplying a suppression factor of the ratio of electroweak scale to a new physics scale .",
    "there are different ways to realize seesaw mechanism .",
    "they can be categorized as type i , type ii and type iii seesaw mechanisms .",
    "the main ingredients of these models are as the followings .",
    "* type i *  @xcite : introducing singlet right - handed neutrinos @xmath6 which transform as : @xmath7 under sm @xmath8 gauge group .",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 does not have sm gauge interactions .",
    "the neutrino masses @xmath9 are given by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs doublet in the sm , @xmath12 is the yukawa coupling and @xmath13 is the right - handed neutrino mass , which sets the new physics scale @xmath14 . if @xmath15 , to obtain the light neutrino mass of order an ev or smaller , @xmath13 is required to be of order @xmath16 gev .",
    "this makes it impossible to directly detect @xmath6 at laboratory experiment .",
    "however , the yukawa coupling @xmath17 does not need to be of order one .",
    "if it turns out to be similar to or smaller than the yukawa coupling for electron , @xmath13 can be as low as a tev .    * type ii *  @xcite : introducing a triplet higgs representation @xmath18 transforming as : @xmath19 . in this type of models ,",
    "the neutrino masses are given by : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the vev of the neutral component of the triplet and @xmath22 is the yukawa coupling .",
    "with a doublet and triplet mixing via a dimensionful parameter @xmath23 , the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) leads to a relation @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the mass of the triplet . in this case",
    "the scale @xmath14 is replaced by @xmath26 . with @xmath27 and @xmath28 ,",
    "the scale @xmath14 is also @xmath16 gev . again",
    "a lower value of order a tev for @xmath29 is possible .    *",
    "type iii *  @xcite : introducing triplet lepton representations @xmath30 with @xmath31 sm quantum numbers .",
    "the resulting mass matrix for neutrinos has the same form as that in type i seesaw .",
    "the high scale @xmath14 is replaced by the mass of the leptons in the @xmath0 triplet representation which can also be as low as a tev .    in the absence of more experimental data , it is impossible to tell which , if any , of the mechanisms is actually correct .",
    "different models should be studied using available data or future ones .",
    "the most direct way of verifying the seesaw mechanism is , of course , to produce the heavy degrees of freedom in the models if they are light enough , and study their properties .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern with the unprecedented high energy and luminosity is the best place to carry out such a test .",
    "major discoveries of exciting new physics at the terascale at the lhc are highly anticipated .",
    "test of seesaw mechanism at lhc has received a lot of attentions recently  @xcite .",
    "however , it is believed that any signal of @xmath6 would indicate a more subtle mechanism beyond the simple type i seesaw due to the otherwise naturally small mixing @xmath32 between the heavy neutrinos and the sm leptons . some of the ways to evade such a situation are to have some new gauge interactions  @xcite or to find solutions where @xmath33 are large which can happen in inverse seesaw models  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of testing the type ii seesaw mechanism at the lhc has been considered by several groups  @xcite .",
    "recently one group including one of us systematically explored the parameter space in this model  @xcite . using preferred parameters from experimental data , they found that in the optimistic scenarios , by identifying the flavor structure of the lepton number violating decays of the charged higgs bosons , one can establish the neutrino mass pattern of the normal hierarchy ( nh ) , inverted hierarchy ( ih ) or quasi - degenerate ( qd ) .",
    "many other signatures of type ii seesaw at the lhc have been studied  @xcite",
    ".    there have also been studies to test type iii seesaw at the lhc  @xcite . due to the fact that the @xmath0 triplet @xmath34 has gauge interactions ,",
    "the production of the heavy triplet particles can have a much larger cross section compared with that in type i seesaw .",
    "the type iii seesaw can be tested in a more comprehensive way up to the tev range . in this paper",
    "we further study some features of the type iii seesaw at lhc . to detect the signals of the heavy triplet leptons",
    ", one needs to understand their decays to sm particles which depend on how light and heavy leptons mix with each other .",
    "similar to type - i seesaw , in this model it is also possible to have small and large mixing @xmath33 between light and heavy leptons  @xcite .    the usual solutions with light and heavy lepton mixing of order the square root of the ratio of light and heavy masses , @xmath1 could lead to a visible displaced vertex in the detector at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "this fact can be used to distinguish small mixing and large mixing between light and heavy leptons .",
    "the latter does not lead to a displaced vertex .",
    "it has long been realized that it is possible to have large light and heavy neutrino mixing originated from the so - called inverse seesaw  @xcite .",
    "this possibility has also received a lot of attentions recently  @xcite . with a large mixing between light and heavy leptons",

    "the analysis carried out in this work , in many ways , is similar to that in ref .",
    "@xcite since in both cases the productions of heavy lepton pairs are through gauge boson mediation , and also the light and heavy lepton mixing comes from seesaw mechanism .",
    "the main differences are that in this model the heavy leptons have electroweak interactions and the mediating gauge bosons in productions are @xmath35 and @xmath36 , while in the model discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the heavy neutrinos do not have electroweak interactions and the mediating particle is the new neutral gauge boson @xmath37 .",

    "we find that there is a relation between the low energy neutrino oscillation and mass parameters , and the heavy triplet lepton decay parameters which has not been considered before in this model .",
    "we first derive this relation , and then make concrete predictions of the heavy triplet lepton signals using this relation for the small mixing solutions .",
    "we consider two ideal production channels , 1 ) @xmath2 and 2 ) @xmath3 in detail .",
    "we also include @xmath4 events reconstruction in the analysis which turns out to give some interesting additional information . with judicious cuts at the lhc ,",
    "the discovery of the heavy triplet leptons as high as a tev can be achieved with 100@xmath5 integrated luminosity . with 300@xmath5 integrated luminosity",
    ", the reach of the scale for heavy triplet leptons can be higher .",
    "the paper is arranged as the following . in sec .",
    "ii we summarize some basic features of type iii seesaw model , paying particular attention to the heavy triplet lepton couplings to sm bosons and light leptons , and display relations between the low energy neutrino oscillation and mass parameters . in sec .",

    "<S> if these heavy triplet leptons are below a tev or so , they can be easily produced at the lhc due to their gauge interactions from being non - trivial representations of @xmath0 . </S>",
