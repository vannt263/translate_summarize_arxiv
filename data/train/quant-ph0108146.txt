    "a fundamental concept in quantum information processing is the connection of a quantum computational model to a physical system by transformations of closed operator algebras .",
    "the concept is a necessary one because in quantum mechanics each physical system is naturally associated with a language of operators ( for example , quantum spin-1/2 operators ) and thus to an algebra realizing this language ( e.g. , the pauli spin algebra generated by a family of commuting quantum spin-1/2 operators ) .",
    "any quantum system defined by an algebra of operators generated by a set of `` basic '' operators can be considered as a possible model of quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the remarkable fact is that an arbitrary physical system is simulatable by another physical system ( or quantum computer ) whenever isomorphic mappings ( embeddings ) between the two operator algebras exists . in each such case , an important problem is to determine whether the simulation is efficient ( polynomial resource overhead ) in terms of the `` basic '' generators .",
    "for example , a nuclear spin ( nmr ) quantum computer is modeled as a collection of quantum spin-1/2 objects and described by the pauli algebra .",
    "it can simulate a system of @xmath2he atoms ( with space discretized by a lattice ) represented by the hard - core bosonic algebra , and vice versa . in this case",
    ", the simulation is efficient .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] summarizes this fundamental concept by giving a variety of proposed physical models for quantum computers and associated usable operator algebras . if one of these systems suffices as the universal model of quantum computing , the mappings between the operator algebras establish the equivalence of the other physical models to it .",
    "this is one s intuitive expectation , and has a well - established mathematical basis @xcite .",
    "the mappings between algebras , between an algebra and a physical system , and between physical systems are necessary in order to be able to simulate physical systems using a quantum computer fabricated on the basis of another system .",
    "however , this does not imply that the simulation is efficiently implementable . as we have previously discussed @xcite ,",
    "efficient quantum computation involves more than having the ability to represent @xmath3 different items of classical information so that the algebra of @xmath4 quantum bits ( qubits ) can be isomorphically represented and quantum parallelism can be exploited .",
    "it is also insufficient for the mapping between operator algebras to be easily and perhaps efficiently formalized symbolically .",
    "for example , the physical system consisting of one boson in @xmath3 modes is described using the language of `` transition '' operators that move the boson from one mode to the other .",
    "formally , the pauli matrices on @xmath4 qubits can be easily represented using the transition operators , but the one - boson system is no more powerful than classical wave mechanics .",
    "this means that unless quantum computers are not as powerful as is believed , there is no efficient simulation of qubits by the one - boson system .    to be useful as a physics simulation device",
    ", a quantum computer must answer questions about physical properties associated with real physical systems .",
    "these questions are often concerned with the expectation values of specific measurements of a quantum state evolved from a specific initial state .",
    "consequently , the initialization , evolution , and measurement processes must all be implementable with polynomial scaling @xcite .",
    "often it is difficult to do .",
    "further , some classes of measurements , such as thermodynamic ones , still lack well - defined workable algorithms @xcite .    on a classical computer",
    ", many quantum systems are simulated by the monte carlo method @xcite . for fermions , the operation counts of these monte carlo algorithms scale polynomially with the complexity of the system as measured by the number of degrees of freedom , but the statistical error scales exponentially ( in time and in number of degrees of freedom ) , making the simulation ineffective for large systems .",
    "a quantum computer allows for the efficient simulation of some systems that are impractical on a classical computer . in our recent paper",
    "@xcite we discussed how to simulate a system of spinless fermions by the standard model of a quantum computer , that is , the model expressed in the language and algebra of quantum spin-1/2 objects ( pauli algebra ) .",
    "we also discussed how to make certain physically interesting measurements .",
    "we demonstrated that the mapping between algebras is a step of polynomial complexity and gave procedures for initial state preparation , evolution , and certain measurements that scaled polynomially with complexity .",
    "the main focus of the paper however was demonstrating that a particular problem for simulating fermions on a classical computer , called the dynamical sign problem , does not exist on a quantum computer .",
    "we are aware of at least one case where the sign problem can be mapped onto an np - complete problem @xcite .",
    "this is the 3-sat problem @xcite .",
    "therefore , one can not yet claim that a quantum computer can solve `` all '' sign problems , otherwise one would claim that one is solving all np - complete problems and this has not been rigorously established .    in this paper",
    "we continue to explore additional issues associated with efficient and effective simulations of physical systems on a quantum computer , issues which are independent of the particular experimental realization of the quantum computer .",
    "we seek to construct quantum network models of such computations .",
    "such networks are sets of elementary quantum gates to which we map our physical system . for simplicity , we discuss these issues relative to simulating a system of spin-1/2 fermions by the standard model of quantum computing .",
    "our discussion has obvious applications to the simulation of a system of bosons ( or any other particle statistics or , in mathematical terms , any other operator algebra ) .",
    "specifically we address issues discovered in our attempt to implement a ( classical ) simulator of a network - based quantum computer and to conduct a quantum computation on a physical system ( nmr ) with a small number of qubits . on a classical computer",
    "the number of qubits simulatable is limited by the exponential growth of the memory requirements .",
    "physically , we can only process information experimentally with systems of a few qubits . having the simulator permits a comparison between theory and experiments likely to be realizable in the near future",
    "overall , the main problems we address are how to reduce the number of qubits and quantum logic gates needed for the simulation of a particular physical phenomena , and how to increase the amount of physical information measurable by designing efficient quantum algorithms .",
    "we organized the paper in the following manner : in section  [ section2 ] we summarize the quantum network representation of the standard model of quantum computation , discussing both one- and multi - qubit circuits .",
    "then we summarize the connection between the spin and fermion representations . in section  [ section3 ]",
    ", we first discuss the initialization , evolution , and measurement processes . in each case",
    "we define procedures simpler than the ones presented in our previous paper , greatly improving the efficiency with which they can be done .",
    "greatly expanded are the types of measurements now possible .",
    "for example , besides certain correlation functions , the spectrum of operators , including the energy operator , can now be obtained .",
    "our application of this technology to a system of fermions on a lattice and the construction of a simulator is discussed in section  [ section4 ] .",
    "the hubbard model is used as an example .",
    "we conclude with a summary and a discussion of areas needing additional work .",
    "the appendices contain technical points about the preparation of coherent and correlated states and the use of the discrete classical fourier transformation .",
    "it is the formal connection between models of computation and physical systems described in the introduction that allows one to simulate quantum phenomena with a quantum computer .",
    "simulation is realized through a quantum algorithm that consists of unitary operations and measurements .",
    "one of the objectives is to accomplish simulation efficiently , i.e , with polynomial complexity .",
    "the hope is that quantum simulation is `` more '' efficient ( less resources ) than classical simulation and there are examples that support such hope @xcite . in the following subsections we summarize the main concepts in the representation of physical phenomena by quantum networks .      in the standard model of quantum computation , the quantum bit , or _",
    "qubit _ , is the fundamental unit .",

    "the time evolution of an @xmath21 qubit system is described by the unitary operator @xmath33 , where @xmath1 represents the time - independent hamiltonian of the system . in turn",
    ", @xmath34 is easily expressible in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath35 since they and their products form an operator basis of the algebra .",
    "the most general unitary operator @xmath36 on a single qubit can be written as @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are real numbers , and @xmath42 are rotations in spin space by an angle @xmath43 about the @xmath44 axis .",
    "although this decomposition is not unique , it is important because any one qubit evolution is seen to be a combination of simple rotations ( up to a phase ) about the @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 axis .    in multi - qubit operations , any unitary operation",

    "these one qubit rotations and two qubit interactions constitute the elementary gates of the quantum computer in the network model .",
    "we now describe some common one and two qubit gates , some quantum circuits , and one pictorial way to represent them .",
    "the motivation for this elementary subsection is to prepare the grounds for the quantum network simulation of a physical system developed in section  [ section3 ] which is more technically involved .",
    "the goal is to represent any unitary operation ( evolution ) as a product of one and two qubit operations .",
    "although here we use the algebra of the pauli matrices ( standard model ) , for a different model of computation we should change the set of elementary gates , but the general methodology remains the same .",
    "for instance , if the evolution @xmath33 is due to the hamiltonian @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are real numbers , we write @xmath34 as @xmath53 because @xmath54_{- } = 0 $ ] . to decompose this into one and two qubit operations , we take the following steps : we first note that the unitary operator @xmath55\\ ] ] takes @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 , so @xmath58 . next we note that the operator @xmath59\\ ] ] takes @xmath60 , so @xmath61 . then we note that @xmath62 takes @xmath63 . by successively similar steps we easily build the required string of operators : @xmath64 and also @xmath65 ( up to a global phase ) : @xmath66 where the integer @xmath67 scales polynomially with @xmath68 ( in this particular case the scaling is linear ) . in a similar way , we decompose the evolution @xmath69 .",

    "we see that if the state of the first qubit is @xmath6 nothing happens , but if the first qubit is in @xmath7 , then the state of the second qubit is flipped . because @xmath81 is the unitary operator that flips the second qubit ( see fig .",
