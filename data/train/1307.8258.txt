    "[ fig : jjchain ] ) , is found from the solution of such a problem with the currents applied to the two ends of the chain , while away from the ends @xmath69 .",
    "mathematically , the problem is just to invert the matrix of the system  ( [ linsys= ] ) . in the absence of disorder ,",
    "the voltage profile away from the ends is still represented by plane waves",
    ". however , in the presence of dissipation , the corresponding wave vector must be complex : @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are determined by the solutions of the equation @xmath72 with real  @xmath20 .",
    "physically , this means that the ac excitation penetrates the chain only within the distance @xmath73 from the ends , and at longer distances it decays because of the absorption .",

    ", the solution for @xmath24 decays away from the ends even in the absence of dissipation , due to the localization , and the corresponding length scale is the localization length  @xmath56 .    when both dissipation and disorder are present , they both contribute to the spatial decay of the solution ( whose rate is called lyapunov exponent ) , and , generally speaking , their effects are not easy to separate . for this reason ,",
    "the notion of the localization length as a function of frequency in the complex plane is not very well defined in the presence of dissipation .",
    "still , in the limit of weak disorder and weak dissipation the effects of localization and absorption can be assumed to be additive .",

    ", one can still label the eigenstates by their wave vector  @xmath55 , and speak about the @xmath55-dependent localization length , which is given by @xmath102 since @xmath103 , the inequality @xmath57 holds almost everywhere , except for a narrow region of  @xmath55 around @xmath104 . at @xmath105",
    "the localization length diverges as @xmath106 .",
    "such low - frequency behaviour is quite common for disordered bosonic problems.@xcite in our case , the divergence is related to the existence of the delocalized zero mode , _",

    "this is the goldstone mode related to the global gauge invariance of the system .",
    "the case of short chains , @xmath109 , is the simplest to analyze theoretically , and at the same time it is quite relevant for experiments . due to the condition @xmath110 ,",
    "the spacing between eigenmode frequencies is larger than their broadening , so the discrete modes are well resolved .",
    "the condition @xmath111 ensures that corrections to the eigenmode profiles and frequencies are relatively small .",
    "the latter , however , does not mean that the correction to the impedance of the chain is small .",
    "indeed , the impedance changes significantly when the eigenmode frequency shift @xmath112 due to disorder is of the order of the broadening @xmath113 , even if @xmath112 is small compared to the frequency @xmath114 itself . at the same time , the disorder - induced corrections to the amplitude @xmath115 and to the broadening produce just small corrections to the impedance .",

    "the difference in statistics of the impedance in the two regimes can be understood from the following qualitative arguments .     a schematic representation of different terms contributing to @xmath127 ( a )  at @xmath128 ( strongly overlapping lorentzians ) , and ( b )  at @xmath129 ( well - separated lorentzians).,width=302 ]",
    "let us focus on the real part of the impedance , which determines the absorption . in terms of the complex eigenmode frequencies which we write as @xmath130 , @xmath131 ,",
    "absorption can be represented by a sum of lorentzians corresponding to the eigenmodes : @xmath132 ( the imaginary parts of @xmath133 have been neglected ) . even though the number of terms in the sum can be very large ,",
    "only those modes effectively contribute to the sum , which are located within a distance @xmath134 from the end ; for others , the coefficient @xmath133 is exponentially small .",
    "the typical distance between the lorentzians corresponds to the typical frequency spacing @xmath135 between the modes within one localization length  @xmath56 , while the typical width of each lorentzian is  @xmath136 .",
    "clearly , one can imagine two regimes , depending on the relation between @xmath136 and @xmath135 .",
    "when @xmath128 , the lorentzians overlap strongly , so the fluctuations of @xmath121 are much smaller than its average [ fig .",
    "[ fig : lorentzians](a ) ] .",
    "when @xmath129 , the lorentzians are well separated , and , depending on the realization of the disorder , the frequency @xmath20  may either fall near one of the peak centers  @xmath137 , which gives a large absorption , or it may fall between the peaks , and then the absorption will be small [ fig .

    "let us count only those modes whose frequencies @xmath137 fall inside this interval ; indeed , the modes whose positions @xmath137 are too far from  @xmath20 ( further than a few times  @xmath136 ) , contribute very little to the sum in eq .",
