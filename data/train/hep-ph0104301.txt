    "presently , the basic spin - averaged characteristics of heavy flavor hadro- , photo- and electroproduction are known exactly up to the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "two main results of the explicit pqcd calculations can be formulated as follows .",
    "first , the nlo corrections are large ; they increase the leading order ( lo ) predictions for both charm and bottom production cross sections approximately by a factor of 2 . for this reason",
    ", one could expect that the higher order corrections as well as the nonperturbative contributions can be essential in these processes , especially for the @xmath1-quark case .",
    "second , the one - loop predictions are very sensitive to standard uncertainties in the input qcd parameters .",
    "in fact , the total uncertainties associated with the unknown values of the heavy quark mass , @xmath2 , the factorization and renormalization scales , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the parton distribution functions are so large that one can only estimate the order of magnitude of the nlo predictions for total cross sections @xcite . for this reason , it is very difficult to compare directly , without additional assumptions , the nlo predictions for spin - averaged cross sections with experimental data and thereby to test the pqcd applicability to heavy quark production .    during the recent years , the role of higher order corrections has been extensively investigated in the framework of the soft gluon resummation formalism . for a review see ref.@xcite .",
    "soft gluon ( or threshold ) resummation is based on the factorization properties of the cross section near the partonic threshold and makes it possible to resum to all orders in @xmath6 the leading ( sudakov double ) logarithms ( ll ) and the next - to - leading ones ( nll ) @xcite .",
    "formally resummed cross sections are ill - defined due to the landau pole contribution , and some prescription must be implemented to avoid the renormalon ambiguities . to obtain numerical predictions for the physical cross sections ,",
    "a few prescriptions have been proposed @xcite .",
    "physically , the choice of a resummation prescription implies the introduction of an effective scale , separating the hard ( perturbative ) and soft ( nonperturbative ) gluon contributions .",
    "another open question , also closely related to the convergence of the perturbative series , is the role of the subleading logarithms which are not , in principle , under control of the resummation procedure @xcite .",
    "numerically , the higher order corrections to the heavy quark production cross sections can depend significantly on the choice of resummation prescription @xcite .",
    "since the spin - averaged characteristics of heavy flavor production are not well defined quantitatively in pqcd it is of special interest to study those spin - dependent observables which are stable under variations of input parameters of the theory @xcite . in this paper",
    "we analyze the charm and bottom production by linearly polarized photons , namely the reactions @xmath7 .",
    "\\label{1}\\ ] ]    we consider the single spin asymmetry parameter , @xmath8 , which measures the parallel - perpendicular asymmetry in the quark azimuthal distribution : @xmath9 where @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the unpolarized cross section , d@xmath12 , @xmath13 is the degree of linear polarization of the incident photon beam , @xmath14 is the centre of mass energy of the process ( [ 1 ] ) and @xmath15 is the angle between the beam polarization direction and the observed quark transverse momentum .",
    "the born level predictions for the single spin asymmetry in ( [ 1 ] ) as well as the contributions of nonperturbative effects ( such as the gluon transverse motion in the target and the heavy quark fragmentation ) have been considered in @xcite .",
    "the following remarkable properties of @xmath8 have been observed :    * the azimuthal asymmetry ( [ 3 ] ) is of leading twist ; in a wide region of initial energy , it is predicted to be about @xmath16 for both charm and bottom quark production .",
    "* at energies sufficiently above the production threshold , the lo predictions for @xmath8 are insensitive ( to within few percent ) to uncertainties in the qcd input parameters : @xmath2 , @xmath4 , @xmath17 , @xmath5 and in the gluon distribution function .",
    "this implies that theoretical uncertainties in the spin - dependent and spin - averaged cross sections ( the numerator and denominator of the fraction ( [ 3 ] ) , respectively ) cancel each other with a good accuracy .",
    "* nonperturbative corrections to the @xmath18-quark azimuthal asymmetry @xmath8 due to the gluon transverse motion in the target are negligible . because of the smallness of the @xmath1-quark mass , the analogous corrections to @xmath19 in the charm case are larger",
    "; they are of the order of 20% .    in the present paper , the soft - gluon corrections to the asymmetry ( [ 3 ] )",
    "are investigated . using the methods of refs.@xcite for the resummation of soft gluons , we resum the sudakov logarithms for the polarized cross section ( [ 2 ] ) in moment space to the nll accuracy .",
    "considering the obtained expression as a generating functional of the perturbative theory , we re - expand it in @xmath6 in momentum space and analyze the fixed order predictions for the azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "our main results can be formulated as follows :    * contrary to the production cross sections , the asymmerty ( [ 3 ] ) in azimuthal distributions of both charm and bottom quark is practically insensitive to radiative corrections at fixed target energies .",
    "this implies that large soft - gluon contributions to the spin - dependent and unpolarized cross sections cancel each other in ( [ 3 ] ) with a good accuracy .",
    "* at the nll level , the nlo and nnlo predictions for @xmath8 affect the lo results by less than 1% and 2% , respectively .",
    "* our computations of higher order corrections indicate a fast convergence of the perturbative series for @xmath8 . we have calculated the asymmetry parameter @xmath8 up to the 6th order ( n@xmath20lo ) in @xmath6 to the nnl accuracy and",
    "have found that corresponding corrections to the born level result are of order of few percent .",
    "our analysis shows that high perturbative stability of @xmath8 is due to the factorization properties of the photon - hadron cross section .",
    "we conclude that , in contrast with the production cross sections , the single spin asymmetry in heavy flavor photoproduction is an observable quantitatively well defined in pqcd : it is stable , both parametricaly and perturbatively , and insensitive to nonperturbative corrections .",
    "measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry in bottom photoproduction would provide an ideal test of the conventional parton model based on pqcd .",
    "concerning the experimental aspects , the azimuthal asymmetry in charm photoproduction can be measured at slac where a coherent bremsstrahlung beam of linearly polarized photons with energies up to 40 gev will be available soon @xcite . due to the @xmath1-quark low mass",

    "we analyze the nlo and nnlo predictions for the azimuthal asymmetry .",
    "we check the quality of the nnl approximation against available explicit results and discuss the subleading logarithms contribution .",
    "higher order corrections and the role of the gluon distribution function in perturbative stability of the asymmetry are considered in section iv .",

    "the only partonic subprocess which is responsible for heavy quark photoproduction is the two - body photon - gluon fusion : @xmath29 to take into account the nlo contributions , one needs to calculate the virtual @xmath30 corrections to the born process ( [ 8 ] ) and the real gluon emission : @xmath31 we neglect the photon-(anti)quark fusion subprocesses as well as the so - called hadronic or resolved component of the photon .",

    "first , at the energies under consideration , the gluon distribution function supports the contribution of the threshold region .",
    "second , the extremum point of the born level cross section , @xmath190 , is practically @xmath193-independent .",
    "in this paper we have investigated the impact of the soft gluon radiation on the single spin asymmetry in heavy flavor production by linearly polarized photons .",
    "our calculations of the spin - dependent cross section at the nll level up to the 6th order in @xmath0 show that the azimuthal asymmetry is practically insensitive to the soft - gluon corrections at fixed target energies . taking into account",
    "the remarkable properties of @xmath8 observed in our previous paper @xcite , we conclude that , unlike the unpolarized cross sections , the single spin asymmetry in heavy flavor photoproduction is an observable quantitatively well defined in pqcd : it is stable both parametricaly and perturbatively , and insensitive to nonperturbative contributions .",
    "this asymmetry is of leading twist and can be measured at slac where the linearly polarized photon beam will be available soon @xcite .",
    "measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry would provide an ideal test of the pqcd applicability to heavy flavor production .",
