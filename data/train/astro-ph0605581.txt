    "we have replaced the @xmath55 production subroutine of galprop @xcite with the present parameterized model and compared the galactic diffuse gamma - ray spectra of @xmath55 origin with that by the built - in subroutine .",
    "a common parameter set , galdef 500180 described in @xcite , has been used in the two calculations .    as shown in figure [ fig : piondecayskymap ]",
    ", the present parameterized model gives a flatter and smoother spectral energy distribution between @xmath101 gev , smaller gamma - ray yield between @xmath102 gev , and a higher power - law index between @xmath103 gev than the galprop built - in model . in @xcite , gamma - ray spectrum of the galprop built - in model was compared with that of model a , after being normalized in the energy range @xmath104 mev .",
    "this normalization enhanced gamma - ray yield in the gev range relative to sub - gev range .",
    "the galprop built - in @xmath6 interaction model has been tuned to reproduce accelerator experiments better than model a of @xcite near the threshold . we have included the resonance contributions in the present model to improve this shortcoming near the threshold .",
    "hence we have change the normalization point to the peak region in @xmath105 , @xmath106 gev , where gamma - rays from @xmath10 decays are expected to dominate ( see figure [ fig : piondecayskymap ] , dashed curve ) .",
    "the present model thus normalized gives @xmath107% higher gamma - ray yield than galprop at 2 gev : this is substantially lower than the difference ( about 50% ) shown in figure 7 of @xcite .",
    "the gamma - ray power - law index of the present model is harder by about 0.05 than that by the galprop built - in model , just as the model a of @xcite predicts .",
    "we have presented the inclusive cross sections of stable secondary particles ( @xmath0 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 ) produced by the @xmath6 interaction in parameterized formulae .",
    "they facilitates computation of secondary particle spectra for arbitrary proton spectra as shown for galactic diffuse gamma - ray spectrum ( figure [ fig : piondecayskymap ] ) .",
    "various effects that these secondary particles may have in astronomical environments can also be calculated at a higher precision .",
    "the formulae incorporate all important known features of the @xmath6 interaction up to about @xmath113 tev and hence will also be useful in calculating background when searching for new phenomena .    the parameterized model predicts all secondary particle spectra to have harder power - law indices than that of the incident proton and their inclusive cross sections to be larger than those expected from the old @xmath6 interaction models . when used to replace the @xmath6 subroutine in galprop @xcite , the model gives a flatter spectral energy density distribution between @xmath114 gev .",
    "the absolute gamma - ray yield predicted by the model is smaller than that by the galprop model for @xmath115  gev but higher for @xmath116  gev .",
    "if normalized near the peak in @xmath105 ( @xmath106  gev ) , the parameterized model gives @xmath107% higher gamma - ray yield at 2  gev than the model of galprop : our model with this normalization can account for @xmath107% , not @xmath117% as was claimed in @xcite , of the discrepancy between the diffuse galactic ridge gamma - ray spectrum observed by egret and model predictions for the proton spectrum near the solar system ( the power - law index @xmath118 ) @xcite .",
    "we note the discrepancy will be reduced by inclusion of the inverse compton component ( see , for example , a model by @xcite ) .",
    "the present model also predicts more @xmath98 than @xmath96 at energies higher wherever those produced by @xmath6 interaction become comparable in flux to primary @xmath96 and @xmath98 .",
    "the formulae and parameters given in the appendices are available as supplementary on - line material both in c language format and as c subroutine .",
    "we are currently parametrizing the angular distribution of gamma - rays relative to the incident proton direction .",
    "the results will be published elsewhere .",
