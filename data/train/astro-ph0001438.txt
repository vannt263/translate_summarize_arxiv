    "the gamma - ray emission of grbs typically has a duration of the order of tens of seconds or less and exhibits little pattern in its very pronounced temporal variation . until 1997 , the brevity of bursts prevented multi - wavelength observation which would allow an accurate localization of the source . as a result , the burst mechanism , environment , location and energy scale have been elusive .",
    "since 1997 , multi - wavelength afterglow observations ( eg . @xcite , @xcite ) have established the distance to several bursts ( eg .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) and illuminated the physics processes occurring a few hours to days after the gamma - ray onset .",
    "the burst mechanism , however , remains a mystery .",
    "prompt radiation provides critical detail about the processes of the burst itself .",
    "detection of such emission , in the optical for instance , requires instruments with wide field - of - view , rapid response and automated operation .",
    "the rotse - i ccd telephoto array meets these objectives ( see @xcite ) .",
    "preliminary data from the batse detectors ( @xcite ) on - board the compton gamma - ray observatory are used by the grb coordinates network ( gcn , @xcite , @xcite ) to generate triggers about once per day providing rough coordinates ( @xmath2 ) within @xmath3 seconds of a burst . a dynamic response points rotse - i at the trigger coordinates within 3 seconds of their receipt .",
    "the discovery of prompt optical emission from grb990123 ( @xcite ) has illustrated properties of early shock development and the immediate environment of bursts .",
    "this paper presents a further search for optical counterparts in a subset of our grb trigger data , as well as a comparison of the results with grb990123 .",
    "the subset of 6 triggers discussed here were taken in the first year of operation .",
    "they were selected for this analysis because they possess localization errors of about 1 square degree or smaller ( see table [ tab : sixgrbs ] ) .",
    "this positional accuracy , which reduces the search area and background by a factor of more than 200 from that available from batse alone , is generally obtained from the relative timing of signals from batse and the gamma - ray detectors on - board ulysses ( @xcite ) .",
    "thin interplanetary network ( ipn ) annuli are generated which are only about @xmath4 wide ( @xcite ) .",
    "the intersection of the batse position probability distribution with such a timing annulus produces an ipn arc a few degrees long . if available",
    ", a third detection reduces this arc to a smaller diamond - shaped region . in the current sample",
    ", 4 bursts are localized to ipn arcs , and grb981121 has an ipn diamond using near data .",
    "the bepposax ( @xcite , @xcite ) satellite observed grb980329 ( @xcite ) , providing a very accurate position .",
    "this sample does not include grbs on the faint end of the batse fluence distribution or short bursts ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "both limitations will be addressed in later analyses .    for prompt grb triggers",
    ", we initially begin taking 5 second exposures to retain sensitivity to rapid variation , then lengthen to 25 second and 125 second exposures to maximize sensitivity . if the trigger position error is of the same order as the rotse - i field - of - view ( @xmath5 ) , we also tile around the given position at specific epochs in the sequence to ensure coverage of sources with errant initial positions but well - localized later .",
    "we then return to the direct pointing with longer exposures and begin the sequence again .",
    "rotse - i first triggered on grb980329 and began the first exposures 11.5 seconds after the burst had started .",
    "unfortunately , the sky was cloudy for the early data and hazy for the later images . nevertheless , some early images are clear enough in the immediate region of the burst to detect 10th magnitude objects . to maximize sensitivity in later , clearer images ,",
    "the last two observations are the result of co - adding two and three frames , respectively .",
    "grb980401 occurred during focusing tests so a manual response of eight exposures was performed .",
    "the last four 125 second exposures were co - added into one observation spread over 897 seconds . the final localization for grb980420 places it near the galactic plane ( most probable @xmath6 ) , and focused images are very crowded .",
    "the optics of the two cameras covering the main part of the ipn arc , however , were poorly focused . the final localization for grb980627 places a majority of the probable area outside of even tiled exposures with the result that we have 40% coverage in only four tiled images .",
    "observing conditions for grb981121 and grb981223 were good .",
    "raw images are dark subtracted and flat - fielded , followed by source finding in the corrected images using sextractor ( @xcite ) .",
    "we then perform an astrometric and photometric calibration by comparison to the hipparcos catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "our astrometric errors are 1.4 arcsec . since we operate with unfiltered ccds to maximize light - gathering ability , photometry is established by comparing raw rotse magnitudes to v - band measures and color correcting based on @xmath7 .",
    "the resulting magnitude , @xmath8 , corresponds on average to @xmath9 but includes sensitivity in the b , v , i and especially r bands .",
    "our photometric errors are 0.02 magnitude for stars brighter than magnitude 12 .",
    "due to observation of an x - ray counterpart for grb980329 , optical ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and radio ( @xcite ) counterparts were observed several hours later . for such precise localizations , we would accept any detection at the known location of the burst .",
    "no optical emission was observed , so for the early images we take the sensitivity to be 0.5 magnitudes brighter than the dimmest sao and gsc stars visible in the immediate region of the burst .",
    "we calculated the limiting sensitivities for the co - added frames by extrapolation of the hipparcos - derived calibration to our @xmath10 threshold .",
    "a cross - check of this calibration was performed by directly comparing to the usno catalog and finding the faintest @xmath8 to which we are more than 50% efficient . given the afterglow measurements , we are able to place a constraint on the overall power - law decline of optical emission from grb980329 to be shallower than @xmath11 with respect to the earliest afterglow detection .",
    "this contrasts with the faster decline of the x - ray emission ( @xcite ) .    for the other bursts",
    ", we require that a source magnitude vary by at least @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the statistical error on the dimmest measurement .",
    "varying objects are only considered bona fide optical counterpart candidates if they appear in at least two successive images .",
    "this removes backgrounds such as cosmic rays and satellite glints which show up frequently in rotse - i images .",
    "no rapidly varying objects were found in the allowed error regions of these five bursts .",
    "the image sensitivities were determined from the hipparcos calibration as described above , and in most cases were cross - checked with the usno catalog comparison .",
    "limiting magnitudes are given in table [ tab : sixlims ] for up to three epochs marking significant improvements in sensitivity .",
    "figure [ fig : grb_timehist ] displays all relevant observations where coverage exceeded 50% , and indicates that rotse - i has sensitivity to optical bursts significantly fainter than grb990123 . the earliest limit is @xmath0 at 10.85 seconds for grb981223 .",
    "the best limit of this sample is @xmath14 at 62 minutes for grb980401 .",
    "we can conclude that bright optical counterparts ( ie .",
    "@xmath15 ) are uncommon .",
    "since prompt optical emission has been seen in grb990123 , we ask whether optical emission from a grb is correlated with gamma - ray output , as is suggested by @xcite .",
    "because we do not know whether fluence or peak flux are accurate measures of the total gamma ray emission , we consider both in our comparison . to bring all bursts onto a common footing ,",
    "we first adjust their @xmath8 limits by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the gamma - ray fluence .",
    "we calculate this fluence to be that measured in the batse 50 - 100 kev plus 100 - 300 kev channels to avoid systematics due to problems in spectral fitting the other channels ( @xcite ) .",
    "these fluence - scaled limits are plotted along with the grb990123 observations in figure [ fig : rfluence ] .",
    "we have also adjusted our optical limits by scaling according to the batse measure of peak flux in the 64ms binning of the 50 - 300 kev data ( see figure [ fig : rflux ] ) .",
    "variation of galactic extinction over the ipn arcs prevents us from quoting an accurate value for most of these bursts .",
    "however , it is much less than 1 magnitude at their most probable locations . since grb990123 has a similar low value of extinction (= 0.04 )",
    ", the effect of galactic extinction on our comparison should be minimal .",
    "the one exception is grb980420 which may have over 2 magnitudes of extinction .",
    "although extinction near the source can only be measured for grb980329 , it is likely most grbs are not so heavily obscured since the great majority observed to have both x - ray and radio counterparts also exhibit optical emission ( @xcite ) .    under the assumption of gamma - ray scaling ,",
    "rotse - i is sensitive to grb990123-like optical bursts for grb981223 from 30 to 300 seconds",
    ". around 1 minute , the optical emission of grb981121 and grb981223 would have been more than 2 magnitudes over our detection threshold .",
    "either grb990123 is atypical of grbs in general , or there is not a strong correlation of optical flux with gamma - ray emission and the inherent dispersion to any actual correlation must be larger than two magnitudes to explain the results from grb981121 and grb981223 .",
    "in a study of six well - localized gamma - ray bursts , no optical counterparts were identified .",
    "when comparing to afterglow observations of grb980329 , we constrain the overall power - law decay of the optical emission to be shallower than @xmath11 . when using either gamma - ray fluence or peak flux as a predictor of optical emission , we find that especially around 1 minute optical emission is at least two magnitudes dimmer than for grb990123 . this non - detection of another optical burst indicates that optical emission is not strongly correlated with gamma - ray output .",
    "we thank the batse team for their grb data and michael briggs for further assistance .",
    "we also thank the near team for their grb981121 data .",
