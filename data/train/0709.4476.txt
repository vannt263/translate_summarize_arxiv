    "radio jets are commonly seen around radio galaxies , which themselves are usually associated with distant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "relatively few examples of radio galaxies are known at distances less than 100  mpc from us .",
    "the radio jets in these systems can have lengths up to a few mpc .",
    "the radio continuum synchrotron emission comes from relativistic electrons spiraling in magnetic fields .",
    "the origin of the power in radio galaxies is tied to energetic events taking place near their nuclei , most likely ejections or outflows from an accretion disk surrounding a massive nuclear black hole ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "smaller - scale jets are often seen near the nuclei of seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in these objects",
    "the jets have lengths from less than a parsec to a few kiloparsecs .",
    "again , the energy source is probably near the nuclear black hole , this time 101000 times less massive than the black holes in radio galaxies .",
    "for example , ngc  3079 hosts a nuclear radio jet feature within the central parsec @xcite and bipolar radio lobes extending out to 3  kpc , perpendicular to the edge - on galaxy plane @xcite .",
    "the circinus spiral galaxy shows similar kpc - scale ( projected ) bipolar radio lobes @xcite , and a projected 100-pc scale jet - like feature aligned with the radio lobes @xcite , together with a parsec - scale nuclear outflow @xcite .",
    "the spiral galaxy 0313 - 192 hosts a one - sided nuclear jet of about 2  kpc length which powers bright radio lobes of type fr  i extending to about 100  kpc from the nucleus @xcite .",
    "curiously , there exist relatively few nearby galaxies with large jets on the 10-kpc scale .",
    "disk galaxies with such jets are even less common .",
    "in fact , the only examples of 15  kpc - scale anomalous radio arms or double - sided radio jets in disk galaxies in the nearby universe are in ngc  4258 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and ngc  7479 @xcite .",
    "the radio jet in ngc  4258 is detected out to about 14 kpc radius and is of spiral form , trailing with respect to the galaxy rotation .",
    "it is clearly interacting with the dense ism gas in the galactic plane , evidenced by similar structures seen in h@xmath5 and x - ray emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and a peculiar distribution of the co line emission in the disk @xcite .",
    "numerous investigations have been carried out on the nature of the jet in ngc  4258 ( e.g.,@xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite argue that the interaction could be indirect via halo gas heated by the jet and falling back onto the disk , so that the jet itself may be extraplanar .",
    "in contrast to the jet in ngc  4258 , the bright , jet - like radio continuum structure in ngc  7479 has remained practically unnoticed since its serendipitous discovery as a byproduct of the observations of @xcite .",
    "ngc  7479 is a relatively nearby ( distance @xmath6  mpc ) sbc type spiral galaxy .",
    "table  [ ngc7479tab ] gives some basic properties of ngc  7479 .",
    "the nucleus has been classified as a liner @xcite and as a seyfert 1.9 @xcite .",

    "the inferred nuclear black hole mass is 1.2@xmath710@xmath11  m@xmath12 , which is almost as large as the nuclear black hole in ngc  4258 ( 4@xmath710@xmath11  m@xmath12 ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ; @xcite @xcite ) .",

    "therefore , the @xmath14/@xmath15 ratio is about a factor of 6 higher in ngc 7479 compared to ngc  4258 .",
    "the vla observations of ngc  7479 at 2  cm with @xmath16  015 resolution @xcite show a @xmath17  mjy  beam@xmath10 nuclear source in ngc  7479 .",
    "vla observations at 6  cm and 20  cm with @xmath16  1  resolution reveal an extended feature pointing from the nucleus towards the north - west @xcite , coinciding with the inner part of the radio jet ( see below ) .",
    "hst _ images ( g. f. benedict , unpublished ) show a complicated dust structure with a stronger dust lane leading into the nucleus from north ( apparently an inner extension of the leading bar dust lane ) .    at larger scales",
    ", there are many signs of a recent perturbation in the disk of ngc  7479 .",
    "these include the strongly asymmetric spiral structure , consisting of a strong and long western spiral arm that appears to bifurcate west of the nucleus , while there is little organized spiral structure on the eastern side ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further signatures of a recent perturbation include the irregular velocity field along the western arm @xcite , a peculiar perturbation in the h@xmath5 velocity field north of the nucleus @xcite , anomalous dust lane structure around the bar as seen in the optical images @xcite , and emission line excitation asymmetries @xcite .",
    "these characteristics have led @xcite and @xcite to suggest that the galaxy has recently suffered a minor merger with a sizable companion .",
    "no companions have been found with optical imaging @xcite or observations within a radius of several tens of kiloparsecs around ngc  7479 @xcite .",
    "there is no visible trace of a remnant of a merging companion either , but the minor merger models of @xcite predict that the nuclear remnant of a mostly disrupted companion should currently be in the bar , north of the nucleus , coinciding with the perturbation in the h@xmath5 velocity field . the strong stellar bar was also proposed to have formed as a result of the minor merger .",
    "the first radio continuum polarization observations of ngc  7479 by @xcite with the vla at several wavelengths with 30  arcsec resolution could not resolve the jet , but showed a curious wing - like pattern at 6  cm , extending perpendicular to the bar , with magnetic field lines oriented parallel to the bar .",
    "this paper reports observations of polarized radio continuum emission from ngc  7479 , and specifically on the anomalous jet - like radio continuum structure that has a total projected extent of around 12  kpc and forms a spiral that _ leads _ with respect to the galaxy rotation .",
    "in other words , the radio continuum feature bends in the opposite sense to the stellar and gaseous spiral arms . since its discovery by @xcite , no evidence of this feature at any other spectral regime has been found .",
    "this suggests that the feature is not interacting with the gas in the disk of ngc  7479 , and likely extends ( at least partly ) out of the plane , while its high radio brightness indicates strong interaction with the ism in the disk .",
    "we present total intensity and polarized emission data that further suggest a jet origin for the anomalous radio continuum feature . the origin , orientation , and nature of the jet are examined , and compared to radio jets seen in other nearby galaxies .",
    "we also investigate the nuclear point source , the bar region , the extended radio continuum emission from ngc  7479 , and the nature of point sources within and outside the optical disk with the help of polarization measurements .",

    "strong interaction of the jet boundaries with the ism gas in the disk also explains the high synchrotron brightness of the jet as a compression of the existing magnetic field in the disk .",
    "if a shock exists in the boundary layer , cosmic - ray particles may also be accelerated or re - accelerated , which would further increase the synchrotron brightness of the jet .",

    "hence , we have to consider the possibility that the disk of ionized gas of ngc  7479 is more extended than in non - interacting systems and also most likely puffed up and strongly distorted ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "another source of faraday rotation could be ionized gas in a cocoon surrounding the jet and generated by instabilities in a transonic shear layer @xcite which would naturally explain the observed frequent field reversals as helical field loops .",
    "however , faraday rotation of up to 300  rad  m@xmath69 and the non - detection of thermal emission from the jet ( see above ) would require regular fields along the line of sight with strengths of up to 37  @xmath0 g for a pathlength of 100  pc , much stronger than the equipartition strength of the ordered magnetic field in the jet itself ( sect .",

    "south asymmetry in total intensity ( intensity ratio of @xmath142 at 3.5 and 6  cm ) could be due to the viewing angle if the northern part of the jet points towards us .",
    "however , our depolarization data strongly suggest that the northern jet is located behind the galaxy disk ( sect .  [",
    "s : dp ] ) and hence points away from us . on the other hand , the fact that the southern jet is not brighter than the northern one is indication that the jet velocity can not be relativistic .",
    "our polarization data show a field orientation that is almost perfectly along the jet . on the other hand ,",
    "the degree of polarization is relatively low ( sect .",
    "[ s : pol ] ) , so that a significant part of the field is not resolved by the telescope beam ( 8  or about 1.3  kpc in most maps shown in this paper ) .",
    "the ratio of the unresolved field to the ordered field , projected into the sky plane , is about three ( sect .",
    "[ s : strength ] ) . such a ratio could be explained by _ a helical field in the jet _ @xcite . radio observations with higher resolution and higher sensitivity with the evla",
    "are required to determine the profile of total and polarized intensity across the jet and hence the field geometry and orientation with respect to the observer .",
    "one of the most interesting features in our radio maps is the reversed pitch angle of the magnetic field orientation along the jet compared to that of the spiral arms .",
    "such a `` leading '' spiral feature can be generated by ram pressure of the ism gas on the jet near the plane with ejection velocities of about 1000  km  s@xmath10 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the jet of ngc  4258 is presumably also located near the plane of its host galaxy and has the same sense of bending as the spiral arms .",
    "ram pressure can hardly play a role for bending the jet , hence the ejection velocities are probably larger than 1000  km  s@xmath10 in ngc  7479 ( see below ) and also in ngc  4258 @xcite .",
    "precession of the jet opposite to the rotation of the galaxy is the most probable cause for the reversed jet bending .",
    "the precession of the jet may be driven by the precession of the accretion disk near the nucleus due to the lense - thirring effect @xcite , by precession of the accretion disk caused by radiation pressure @xcite , or by a merger event which resulted in a binary black hole @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that ngc  7479 has recently undergone or is undergoing a minor merger event . according to @xcite the position of the merging nucleus is now at the bright near - infrared and h@xmath5 knot about 17  north of the nucleus .    as the jet is probably located near the plane and",
    "interacts with the ism gas , differential rotation of the galaxy would change the orientation of the precessing jet to form a trailing spiral , opposite to what is observed in ngc  7479 . for a rough estimate of this effect",
    "we take the rotation speed as 180  km  s@xmath10 at 7  kpc radius @xcite . to avoid significant bending of the jet by differential rotation",
    ", the jet propagation speed has to be larger than @xmath2  5000  km  s@xmath10 which gives a travel time along the jet , and hence an age , of less than @xmath143 years , consistent with the synchrotron age of the cosmic - ray electrons ( section  [ s : strength ] ) .    the anomalous 15  kpc - scale radio continuum structure that we see emanating from the nucleus of ngc  7479 as a radio jet could be indirectly related to the minor merger event ( perturbation of the underlying gravitational potential of the parent galaxy leading to perhaps episodic fueling of the nucleus ) which may have also created the bar and the asymmetric spiral arm structure .",
    "the timescale of the minor merger , several times 10@xmath144 years , is naturally much longer than the timescale of the jet ( of order 10@xmath4 years ) .",
    "further evidence for recent global perturbations is seen in optical images ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ arcsec2fig ] ) which show anomalous dust lanes intersecting the bar at almost right angles .",
    "one such crossing point is in the bar near the southeastern jet extension .",
    "the dust lanes come from the western side of the bar , intersect the bar at almost right angles , and can be followed on the eastern side of the bar for a short distance .",
    "it is also possible that as the jet is propagating near the plane of the galaxy ( and near the orientation of the bar ) , it has recently encountered objects along its path that made it bend , so that the jet ends moved above and below the plane . in the north , such a barrier could be due to the merging nucleus which lies slightly north of the point where the jet leaves the bar . in the south",
    ", it is possible that the dust lanes trace the trail left behind by tidally stripped molecular clouds of the disrupted companion , and they cross the bar just outside the point where the jet bends towards southeast .",
    "co emission is seen only in the bar , but in the south this is close to the point where the dust lanes cross the bar @xcite .",
    "thus these molecular clouds could have blocked the passage of the jet in the bar direction , deflecting it outside the bar .",
    "simulations of jet deflection by a companion galaxy or by dense clouds have been made by @xcite , who used a jet velocity around 4500  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "these simulations did not attempt to model any specific observed system , but were of general nature . to get a deflection towards a certain direction ,",
    "the impact must have taken place off center with respect to the companion or molecular clouds .",
    "this is difficult to verify without knowing the exact jet speed and direction , and an accurate value for the pattern speed of the bar in which the companion and molecular clouds are trapped .",
    "the jet is rather variable in strength along its propagation direction , and even has sections along its length which could be gaps .",
    "this could be due to an intermittent emission mechanism ( `` blobs '' ) , or it could be related to the compression / deflection mechanism mentioned above .",
    "it is unlikely that the structure that we see is an outflow or wind from the nucleus driven by the minor merger , since we do not see any evidence for the jet - like structure at any other than radio continuum wavelengths ( a total lack of enhanced emission outside of the bar at other wavelengths ) .",
    "furthermore , the feature is relatively narrow and has an almost perfectly aligned magnetic field , which would not be expected for an outflow .",
    "in fact , radio jets are predicted to exist in galaxies with relatively weak agn , such as the one in ngc  7479 , instead of torus outflows @xcite .",
    "future vlbi observations have the potential of revealing the orientation of the jet near the nucleus , and thus giving further clues to its origin @xcite .",
    "the nearest ( at around 7  mpc ) example of a spiral galaxy with a kpc - scale radio jet is ngc  4258 @xcite .",
    "the radio jet extends to about 14  kpc and has a spiral shape , but with the same pitch angle as the optical spiral arms ( it winds in the same sense as the stellar spiral arms ) , unlike the anomalous radio continuum arms of ngc  7479 .",
    "the jet in ngc  4258 has large rm values , even larger than in ngc  7479 , possibly originating from a cocoon around the jet @xcite .",
    "the intensities of the two jets at 3.5  cm are comparable , several mjy per beam at a resolution of about 12 , and the highest intensities outside the nucleus are some distance away from the nucleus along the jet .",
    "the spectral indices are also comparable , about @xmath145 to @xmath146 in both galaxies . as",
    "the jet of ngc  4258 is narrower ( @xmath147  pc ) than the partly resolved jet in ngc  7479 , the total magnetic field as determined from the radio maps at 3  resolution is much stronger ( @xmath148 g ) .",
    "the degree of polarization in the jet of ngc  4258 is much higher ( 35%65% ) than in ngc  7479 , yielding stronger regular fields , consistent with the higher rotation measures in ngc  4258 .",
    "perhaps the most important difference is that the inner radio jet in ngc  4258 has its counterpart in h@xmath5 and x - ray emission @xcite , which is not seen for the bent jet in ngc  7479 , and that there is a clear interaction with the dense ism in the inner disk because co line emission is seen along the inner jet @xcite .",
    "the broader radio jet of ngc  7479 and its weaker magnetic field strength indicate weaker interaction with the ism than in ngc  4258 , which may explain the lack of any signature of the jet in ngc  7479 in other spectral regimes .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  4258 has been classified as liner @xcite or a relatively weak sy  1.9 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and therefore has a similar nuclear activity level as ngc  7479 .    the edge - on disk galaxy 0313 - 192 at a distance of close to 300  mpc has huge ( 200  kpc ) radio lobes of radio source type fr  i which extend perpendicular to the disk @xcite .",

    "therefore , the radio feature in ngc  7479 is most likely driven by the active nucleus , whereas the radio structure in ngc  3079 is driven by the central starburst .",
    "other radio lobes / outflow features among nearby edge - on spiral galaxies are seen , e.g. , in the sombrero galaxy ngc  4594 and in ngc  4235 @xcite .",
    "the nearby circinus galaxy ( distance @xmath153  mpc ) has bipolar radio lobes @xcite , a 10  pc - scale nuclear jet - like feature emanating from the seyfert  2 nucleus , aligned with the radio lobes @xcite , and a parsec - scale nuclear outflow @xcite .",
    "again , no kpc - scale radio jet is seen .    in summary , starburst galaxies , such as m82 ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and ngc 3079 ( above ) possess diffuse radio lobes that are usually oriented perpendicular to the galaxy disk .",
    "@xcite found that several nearby edge - on seyferts galaxies also have kpc - scale diffuse radio continuum morphologies which are not always aligned along the galaxy minor axis .",
    "ngc  7479 does not possess a strong nuclear starburst , has a 15  kpc - scale , relatively well - collimated radio jet , and therefore differs from both the starburst galaxies and seyferts with diffuse kpc - scale radio continuum structures .",
    "thus , it represents a previously unknown type of galaxies with a possibly interaction - triggered , 15  kpc - scale , most likely short - lived radio jet which is radio - bright due to its location very close to the disk plane .",
    "we have examined the nature of the anomalous 15-kpc scale jet - like feature in the nearby barred spiral galaxy ngc  7479 with radio continuum observations at 3.5/3.6 , 6 , 18 , and 22  cm .",
    "we have found strong evidence to support the jet - like nature of this feature and its origin in the nucleus of the galaxy .",
    "most importantly , we have shown that the large - scale radio properties of ngc  7479 differ from any other previously mapped disk galaxy in a fundamental way .",
    "therefore , ngc  7479 provides us a unique opportunity to study interaction - triggered , short - lived , 15-kpc scale radio jets and large - scale magnetic fields in disk galaxies .",
    "our observations suggest that the jet of ngc  7479 is located very close to the disk plane , and thus it causes compression of the interstellar magnetic fields and acceleration of cosmic - ray particles , resulting in an exceptionally radio - bright jet . however , the magnetic field in the jet of ngc  7479 is about ten times weaker than in ngc  4258 , which could account for the lack of associated extended h@xmath5 and the weak x - ray emission .",
    "the polarized radio emission from the jet serves as a background against which we can measure , with the help of faraday rotation and depolarization , the structure of the regular magnetic field in the foreground disk of ngc  7479 with unprecedented precision .",
    "this technique has revealed multiple magnetic field reversals in the disk .",
    "we have produced the most detailed study of spiral disk galaxy magnetic fields using the jet in ngc  7479 .      1 .",
    "the total magnetic field strength is @xmath154 g in the inner jet and @xmath62 g in the outer jet , which limits the lifetime of cosmic - ray electrons to about 10@xmath155 years .",
    "we find that the magnetic field is closely aligned along the radio continuum jet feature throughout its extent .",
    "the degree of polarization at 3.5  cm is 6%8% along the jet , and remarkably constant , which is consistent with helical field models for jets .",
    "we can exclude the possibility that the observed faraday rotation ( rm ) between 3.5 and 6  cm and the depolarization ( dp ) between 6 and 22  cm occur in the jet itself because we do not see an anti - correlation between rm and dp ( as would be expected if synchrotron emission and faraday rotation occur in the same volume ) and no h@xmath5 and only weak x - ray emission is detected along the jet .",
    "the observed faraday rotation and depolarization are consistent with magneto - ionic gas in the disk of the galaxy , between us and the jet , with a regular field strength of about @xmath136 g and thermal electron densities of @xmath156  @xmath3 near the bar and @xmath157  @xmath3 outside the bar .",
    "the jet can not be bent out of the disk scale by more than a few degrees and its true total length is about 15 kpc . some fraction of the faraday effects may be generated in a cocoon of ionized gas and regular magnetic fields around the jet .",
    "the regular magnetic field in the disk of the galaxy has multiple reversals on scales of 12  kpc , indicating field loops stretched by a shearing gas flow in the bar potential of the galaxy or by gas flows related to the merger event .",
    "faraday dispersion by cells of random field in the foreground disk can explain the depolarization data .",
    "this model can also account for the total depolarization of the northern jet at 22  cm if this part of the jet is located behind the galaxy disk .",
    "the `` leading '' spiral morphology of the jet , opposite to the trailing sense of the stellar and gaseous spiral arms , may be due to precession , driven by a precessing accretion disk near the nucleus or a binary black hole system .",
    "either one of these could be a consequence of a recent minor merger event in this system .",
    "alternatively , jet bending could be due to an off - center collision with pieces of the companion ( its nucleus and dense molecular clouds ) which happened to be in the path of the jet .",
    "as the jet interacts with the ism in the disk , the jet must propagate at a speed of more than 5000  km  s@xmath10 to avoid bending by differential rotation and hence is most likely less than about 10@xmath155 years old , and thus a very recent feature .",
    "this may explain why such jets are not commonly seen in nearby disk galaxies .",
    "the jet of ngc  7479 is the second case of a large jet located almost in the plane of the host galaxy .",
    "compared to ngc  4258 , the jet in ngc  7479 is broader , less polarized , hosts a weaker magnetic field , and is bent in a sense opposite to that of the spiral arms .",
    "both jets are radio - bright , probably due to interaction with the dense ism gas of the disk , lose most of their energy within the disk , and hence can not form outer radio lobes .",
    "more sensitive h@xmath5 and x - ray observations are needed to search for signs of interaction between the jet and the interstellar medium .",
    "we are grateful to vladimir shoutenkov for help with the data reduction and to matthias ehle for providing the x - ray image and for model - fitting of the x - ray data .",
    "we thank marita krause for a critical reading of the manuscript and many useful comments on an earlier version of this paper .",
