    "the first experimental observation of a pentaquark baryon , the @xmath0 , was made in photon - nucleus reaction @xcite .",
    "later , the existence of the @xmath3 was confirmed by the analyses on kaon - nucleus @xcite , photon - deuteron @xcite , photon - proton @xcite , and neutrino - nucleon reactions @xcite .",
    "till now , only the upper bound of the @xmath0 decay width is known , it is around 9 - 25 mev . because of its positive strangeness , the minimal quark content of the @xmath0 is @xmath13 and thus has hypercharge @xmath14 .",
    "this means that the @xmath3 can not be a three - quark state , and hence should be an exotic @xcite .",
    "such a narrow pentaquark state was predicted by chiral soliton model @xcite .",
    "there , the @xmath3 is an isosinglet and forms a baryon anti - decuplet with other pentaquark states , which is also anticipated in the skyrme model @xcite . if we consider baryons consisting of four quarks and one anti - quark , the flavor su(3 ) group structure says that such systems can form the multiplets of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "if the @xmath0 is an isosinglet , then it would be a member of the baryon anti - decuplet .- plet contains isotensor @xmath21 which has @xmath22 , while the @xmath23 isovector @xmath21 is a member of the @xmath16-plet . ]",
    "the recently observed @xmath24 , which carries @xmath25 and @xmath26 @xcite , could be a member of the anti - decuplet as its minimal quark content is @xmath27 .",
    "such a state was also predicted by quark models and soliton models as an @xmath28 member of the baryon anti - decuplet .",
    "therefore , if confirmed by other experiments , the observation of the @xmath29 strongly supports the existence of baryon anti - decuplet with the _ isoscalar _ @xmath3 .",
    "however the @xmath30 and @xmath23 members of the baryon anti - decuplet are under debate , since these are crypto - exotic states and can not be distinguished from three - quark baryons by the quantum numbers .",
    "therefore , identifying those members is strongly dependent on the structure of the low - lying pentaquark states . in ref .",
    "@xcite , jaffe and wilczek suggested a diquark - diquark - antiquark picture for the pentaquark anti - decuplet .",
    "for physical states of the @xmath30 and @xmath23 baryons , they considered mixing with pentaquark octet and identified @xmath31 and @xmath32 as pentaquark states .",
    "scattering , the jlich group claimed that the roper @xmath31 might be a quasi - bound @xmath33 state instead of a genuine three - quark state @xcite . ] further extensions of this picture for pentaquark baryons can be found e.g. , in refs . @xcite .",
    "other theoretical investigations on the @xmath3 and/or baryon anti - decuplet can be found , e.g. , in refs .  .",
    "the production of the @xmath3 can also be investigated in heavy - ion collisions as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a statistical model is used to predict that the @xmath3 yield is about 12 - 14% of the @xmath34 yield in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the dependence of the yield on the collision energy was discussed in ref .",
    "moreover , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was claimed that @xmath3 production can be a useful probe of the initially produced quark - gluon plasma state , because the number of the @xmath3 formed in the quark - gluon plasma can be non - trivial and the final state interaction through the hadronic phase is not large .",
    "however , as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , such claims depend crucially on understanding the strength of the hadronic interactions of the @xmath3 . thus investigating",
    "the hadronic interaction of the @xmath3 is important not only in understanding its structure but also in probing heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the elementary production processes of the @xmath3 baryon have been investigated by several groups . in refs .",
    "@xcite , lin and ko estimated the total cross sections of @xmath3 production in photon - nucleon , meson - nucleon , and nucleon - nucleon reactions .",
    "it is further improved by including the anomalous magnetic moment interaction terms for @xmath35 reaction in ref .",
    "@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have reported the total and the differential cross sections for @xmath36 , @xmath35 , and @xmath37 reactions , which was an improvement over previous studies in that we consistently included @xmath6 exchanges . recently , liu _",
    "considered the reaction of @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "some polarization observables in @xmath3 photoproduction are also estimated in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper , as a continuation of our efforts to understand the @xmath3 production processes , we investigate its production in @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions .",
    "these reactions were previously investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath39 and @xmath40 reactions , and then the cross sections were isospin - averaged .",
    "we improve this calculation by considering the @xmath6 exchanges and we also consider @xmath41 reaction , which will be shown to have larger cross section than @xmath42 .",
    "in addition , we derive isospin relations for different isospin channels in @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions .    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the production cross sections are strongly dependent on the quantum numbers of the @xmath3 , which is an important issue to be resolved .",
    "are strongly dependent on the parity of the @xmath3 .",
    "the cross sections for odd - parity @xmath3 were shown to be much smaller than those for even - parity @xmath3 by an order of magnitude .",
    "it is also shown that the differential cross section would have different angular distribution for different parity of the @xmath3 depending on the coupling @xmath43 .",
    "] first , the spin of the @xmath3 is believed to be @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "but the parity of the @xmath3 is still under debate .",
    "if we assume that every quark is in the s - wave ground state as in the usual three - quark baryons , the parity of the pentaquark ground state would be odd because of the existence of one antiquark . some quark models",
    "@xcite , qcd sum rules @xcite , and lattice qcd @xcite support @xmath45 .",
    "however it is also claimed that the state with antisymmetric spatial wavefunction should be the ground state @xcite , which is consistent with the soliton model predictions @xcite .",
    "furthermore , recent quark model studies show that the ground state is in a p - wave if one includes the orbital motion of the quarks , which makes the ground state have even parity @xcite .",
    "this is also consistent with the heavy pentaquark ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) study in the skyrme model , which predicts that the ground state has @xmath4 while the state with @xmath48 is the first excited state @xcite .",
    "thus , in this paper , we assume that the @xmath0 has @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "ii , we compute the total and differential cross sections for @xmath51 reaction . the cross sections for @xmath52",
    "is then obtained in sec .",
    "iii , with @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we shall find that the @xmath55 channel has larger cross sections than the @xmath56 channel by about a factor of 5 .",
    "section iv contains a summary and discussion .",
    "as we have discussed before , we assume that the @xmath3 is a @xmath58 isoscalar particle belonging to baryon anti - decuplet .",
    "then in the case of @xmath1 reaction , we have four possible isospin channels in @xmath3 production , @xmath59 the possible tree diagrams for @xmath60 are shown in fig .  [ fig : kn ] . here",
    "we denote the momenta of the incoming kaon , outgoing pion , initial nucleon , and the final @xmath3 as @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the feynman diagrams for the other isospin channels can be obtained in the same way .",
    "there are a few comments regarding the production mechanisms .",
    "first , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](b ) . in this work , however , we extend the model of ref .",
    "@xcite by including @xmath5-channel @xmath6 exchange , which allows the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](a ) . as we shall see later",
    ", the contribution from the @xmath6 exchange is non - trivial although its magnitude depends on the unknown coupling @xmath43 .",
    "a recent estimate on this coupling gives @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "if this is true , then the contribution from the @xmath6 exchange should be important .",
    "second , one may consider other nucleon or @xmath66 excitations as an intermediate baryon state in fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](b ) . to begin with , the @xmath66 excitation is excluded because of its isospin if the @xmath3 is an isosinglet .",
    "furthermore , su(3 ) symmetry does not allow the coupling of the anti - decuplet baryon with baryon decuplet and meson octet @xcite .",
    "is an isotensor particle @xcite , it should be a member of the * 35 * multiplet @xcite .",
    "then it has very different selection rules @xcite and only the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](b ) with the @xmath66 excitation as an intermediate state is allowed for its production from @xmath1 reactions with two - body final state .",
    "diagrams like figs .",
    "[ fig : kn](a , c ) are forbidden by isospin in this case .",
    "] other nucleon resonances such as the nucleon analog of the @xmath3 in the anti - decuplet can contribute through the diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](b ) .",
    "however , this brings in additional unknown coupling constant for antidecuplet - antidecuplet - octet interaction .",
    "thus it will not be considered in this exploratory study . in fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](c ) , we have @xmath67-channel diagram which contains @xmath68 as an intermediate state . if the @xmath68 is an isovector particle , it can contribute to the production process .",
    "but if it is an isotensor particle , it can not .",
    "since the nature , mass , and couplings of the @xmath68 are very unclear , we do not consider fig .",
    "[ fig : kn](c ) in this paper .",
    "we start with the su(3 ) symmetric lagrangian for the interactions of baryon anti - decuplet with meson octet and baryon octet @xcite , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the baryon anti - decuplet , @xmath71 the pseudoscalar meson octet , and @xmath72 the baryon octet .",
    "this leads to @xmath73 where @xmath74 the coupling @xmath75 is related to the universal coupling constant @xmath76 by @xmath77 .",
    "the effective lagrangian for @xmath78 interaction can be obtained in the same way , @xmath79 where we have dropped tensor coupling terms as in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the other effective lagrangians necessary for @xmath80 reaction are @xmath81 here , we follow the prescription , e.g. , of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely , we use pseudovector coupling for pion interactions and pseudoscalar coupling for the interactions involving strangeness . the production amplitude for fig .",
    "[ fig : kn ] is given by @xmath82 where @xmath83 each vertex has a form factor in the form of @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the mass and the momentum squared of the exchanged particle , respectively .",
    "the value of the cutoff parameter @xmath34 will be discussed later .    for the coupling constants",
    ", we use the well - known value for @xmath87 as @xmath88 .",
    "the @xmath6 decaying into @xmath89 then yields @xmath90 , which is close to the su(3 ) symmetry value , @xmath91 .",
    "the coupling @xmath75 can be , in principle , determined from the decay width of @xmath92 .",
    "however , at this moment , only its upper bound is known from experiments , 925 mev .",
    "theoretically , the chiral soliton model predicted 15 mev in ref .",
    "@xcite , which was later improved to be about 5 mev @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the @xmath3 decay width is 5 mev , then we have @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "recent analyses on @xmath1 elastic scattering data favor such a small decay width of the @xmath3 @xcite or a smaller decay width , namely 1 mev or even less @xcite . in the existing data for @xmath94 channel was also reported in ref .",
    "] there is only one experimental information about the total cross section of @xmath3 production in @xmath36 reaction near threshold @xcite , which , however , should be confirmed by further analyses @xcite .",
    "therefore in this paper , we do not try to fix @xmath75 .",
    "instead , we give the results with @xmath95 so that future experimental data can be used to estimate the coupling constants with our predictions .",
    "we also note that @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath96 mev .",
    "we also point out that the @xmath21 couplings to @xmath97 and @xmath98 have different phase , which differs from ref .",
    "our convention is consistent with the su(3 ) symmetry for the anti - decuplet @xcite and is crucial to obtain the isospin relations ( [ kn : iso ] ) .",
    "finally for @xmath99 , there is no information for this coupling . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have mentioned that precise measurements on the differential cross sections for @xmath100 and @xmath37 reactions can be used to estimate this coupling .",
    "recently it was estimated to be @xmath101 based on some theoretical assumptions @xcite .",
    "because of the lack of precise information , however , we treat @xmath43 as a free parameter and give the results by varying its value as we did in ref .",
    "it should be also noted that the @xmath102 interaction contains tensor coupling .",
    "the contribution from this term should be examined but will not be discussed in this qualitative study .",
    "the other isospin channels can also be calculated using the effective lagrangians above , and it is straightforward to find the following isospin relation , and @xmath98 , one may consider diagrams like fig .  [",
    "fig : kn](c ) with the @xmath3 as the intermediate state .",
    "however , these diagrams are not allowed since the @xmath103 interaction is prohibited by isospin . ]",
    "@xmath104 note that the different phase between the @xmath105 and @xmath106 interactions is essential to have the above relation . in this paper",
    ", we give the results for the @xmath94 reaction only .",
    "cross sections for the other isospin channels can then be read from our result by using the isospin relation above .    the total cross section for @xmath107 is plotted in fig .  [ fig : kp - tot ] . since we do not have any experimental information , we first present the result without form factor in fig .",
    "[ fig : kp - tot](a ) . the results with the form factor ( [ ff ] )",

    "figure [ fig : kp - diff ] shows the role of the @xmath6 exchanges in a transparent way . without @xmath6 exchange , we have the @xmath117-channel diagram only [ fig .  [",

    "[ fig : kp - diff ] .",
    "they are peaked at backward scatting angles . with @xmath6 exchanges ,",
    "the differential cross sections ( the dashed and solid lines ) have additional peaks at forward angles .",
    "thus , the forward peaks in fig .  [ fig : kp - diff ] are purely developed from the @xmath6 exchange and can be larger than the backward peak depending on @xmath12 .",
    "so measurements of differential cross section can give informations on the magnitude of the coupling @xmath43 , which can not be estimated from the @xmath3 decay width .",
    "but we find that the phase of @xmath12 can not be distinguished in these results .",
    "in this section , we investigate @xmath52 reactions where @xmath119 stands for @xmath54 or @xmath34 baryons .",
    "the @xmath40 process was considered within @xmath7 exchange model in ref .",

    "we give more extensive calculation by including @xmath6 exchanges .",
    "we also study @xmath8 reaction which was not considered in ref .",

    ", we have an additional channel in the final state , i.e. , @xmath8 .",
    "the production amplitudes of this reaction read @xmath142 for @xmath7 and @xmath6 exchanges , where @xmath143 the form factor ( [ ff ] ) is assumed to be multiplied to each vertex .    in fig .",

    "[ fig : np - tot2 ] are the results with the form factor ( [ ff ] ) and @xmath109 gev .",
    "these results show that the @xmath6 exchange dominates the process if @xmath145 is not so small .",
    "they also show that @xmath7 and @xmath6 exchanges have different energy dependence in the total cross sections .",
    "the role of @xmath6 exchange can also be identified in differential cross sections .",
    "figures  [ fig : np - diff1 ] and [ fig : np - diff2 ] show the differential cross sections at @xmath146 gev without and with the form factors ( with @xmath109 gev ) .",
    "the scattering angle @xmath114 is defined by the directions of @xmath147 and @xmath148 in cm frame .",
    "it is clearly seen from these figures that the differential cross sections have symmetric shape about @xmath149 in both reactions , which can be expected from the structure of the production amplitudes , e.g. , in eq .",
    "( [ amp : np ] ) regardless of the exchanged meson .",
    "since the ratio of the minimum and maximum values of the differential cross sections depends on the ratio of coupling constants , measurement of the ratio would shed light on the determination of the magnitude of @xmath12 .",
    "but the results are nearly independent on the phase of @xmath150 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : np - diff2 ] ) .",
    "we have estimated the cross sections for @xmath3 baryon production from @xmath1 and @xmath2 reactions focusing on the role of the @xmath6 exchanges .",
    "we found that isospin relations hold in @xmath151 and @xmath152 reactions .",
    "we have also estimated the cross section for @xmath8 , which is found to be much larger than that for @xmath153 .    without @xmath6 exchange , we found that there is only a backward peak in the differential cross sections for @xmath1 reactions .",
    "the forward peak in fig .",
    "[ fig : kp - diff ] is completely ascribed to the @xmath6 exchange .",
    "thus precise measurements on the differential cross sections will give a chance to determine the magnitude of the @xmath43 coupling .",
    "in @xmath2 reactions , we found that both @xmath7 exchange and @xmath6 exchange give double peaks , forward and backward peaks , and symmetric differential cross sections .",
    "therefore , measuring the ratio of the maximum and minimum values of the differential cross sections can also give an information on the couplings .",
    "as we have discussed , investigation of @xmath3 production processes in meson - nucleon and nucleon - nucleon reactions are useful in understanding the interactions and the production mechanisms of the @xmath3 , as well as in providing an important information for the @xmath3 yield in heavy - ion collisions , where hadronic final state effects should be taken into account .",
    "experimental studies on these reactions are , therefore , highly required and might be available at current experimental facilities .",
