    "accurate measurements of flow velocities are essential for exploring and understanding fluid dynamics .",
    "such measurements raise important technical problems whenever one needs them to be nonintrusive .",
    "indeed , many applications where direct access to the fluid is impossible perclude the use of local probes such as miniature piezoelectric pressure probes , hot films or hot wires .",
    "in other cases , the introduction of a probe inside the fluid may perturb the flow or even the fluid structure itself , and may lead to incorrect interpretations of the measurements .",
    "thus , in general , much insight can be gained from some remote , noninvasive sensing of the flow field .    in the following ,",
    "we focus on the case of complex fluids under simple shear .",
    "a `` complex '' fluid may be characterized by the existence of a `` mesoscopic '' length located somewhere between the size of individual molecules and the size of the sample @xcite .",
    "for instance , this intermediate length scale is the particle diameter in a colloidal suspension , the diameter of an oil droplet in an emulsion , or the radius of gyration of polymer coils .",
    "the existence of such a supramolecular organization ( or `` microstructure '' ) can lead to very complicated behaviors under flow and to inhomogeneous velocity profiles under simple shear @xcite .",
    "since the microstructure of a complex fluid is very sensitive to local deformations , it is quite obvious that a nonintrusive technique is required in order to measure velocity profiles .",
    "the most popular nonintrusive techniques , namely particle imaging velocimetry ( piv ) or laser doppler velocimetry ( ldv ) , are based on the interaction between light and seeding particles following the flow @xcite .",
    "however , many complex fluids , such as emulsions , slurries , or pastes , may not be transparent enough to allow the use of piv or ldv .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) offers the possibility to image opaque media @xcite but requires the use of powerful magnets and remains expensive and tricky to set up . on the other hand , ultrasound appears as an efficient , cost - effective tool to measure velocity profiles in a large range of fluids .    in this paper",
    ", we adapt a speckle - based ultrasonic velocimetry technique @xcite to complex fluid flows .",
    "although based on the classical principle of backscattering by particles suspended in the flow , our technique brings an original contribution to both the fields of acoustical flow measurements and of complex fluid studies . indeed , by using high - frequency pulses ( frequencies larger than 20  mhz ) , we show that we are able to measure velocity profiles in complex fluids sheared between two plates separated by 1  mm with a spatial resolution of about 40  @xmath0 m . depending on the required accuracy , a full velocity profile can be obtained typically in 0.02  s to 2  s , which makes it possible to resolve transient regimes or temporal fluctuations of the flow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first explain in more details why local velocity measurements are crucial to the understanding of complex fluids .",
    "examples are given that show that inhomogeneous flows may occur even in simple shear geometries and at small imposed stresses .",
    "the third section is devoted to a brief review of existing ultrasonic techniques for measuring flow velocities .",
    "we then present the electronic setup and the data analysis used for high - frequency ultrasonic speckle velocimetry ( usv ) .",
    "section  [ s.calib ] deals with the calibration step necessary to obtain quantitative estimates of the velocity . in section  [ s.lamellar ] ,",
    "high - frequency usv is applied to a particular complex fluid : an aqueous solution of surfactant .",
    "the ultrasonic data reveal the existence of inhomogeneous flows , with both wall slip and shear bands , as well as complex spatio - temporal behaviors during transient regimes . finally ,",
    "in light of the present results , the technique is compared to other nonintrusive tools used in the field of complex fluid flows .",
    "we emphasize on the promising spatio - temporal resolution of usv and discuss its possible future applications .",
    "it is well - known that shear flows of simple fluids are laminar at low velocities and may become unstable above a critical reynolds number due to hydrodynamic instabilities @xcite .",
    "a classical shear geometry is the _ couette geometry _ in which the fluid is sheared between two concentric cylinders as sketched on fig .",
    "[ f.couette ] .",
    "usually the inner cylinder of radius @xmath1 is rotating while the outer cylinder of radius @xmath2 remains fixed .",
    "the two cylinders are thus called `` rotor '' and `` stator '' respectively .",
    "the distance @xmath3 between the two walls is called the `` gap '' of the couette cell .",
    "this couette geometry will be used throughout the paper as well as the cylindrical coordinates @xmath4 .",
    "we will denote @xmath5 the distance from the inner cylinder and @xmath6 the velocity vector .",
    "a couette device can work in two different modes : either a torque @xmath7 is imposed on the rotor and the rotor angular velocity @xmath8 is measured , or @xmath8 is imposed and the torque @xmath7 is measured . for a newtonian fluid at small velocities ,",
    "the flow is stationary and purely orthoradial @xmath9 . the tangential velocity @xmath10 decreases from the rotor velocity @xmath11 down to zero on the outer wall . in the small gap approximation _",
    "i.e. _ when @xmath12 , the velocity profile is linear as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.exs](a )",
    ". the shear rate @xmath13 ( @xmath14-component of the rate - of - strain tensor ) and the shear stress @xmath15 ( tangential force per unit surface _ i.e. _ @xmath14-component of the stress tensor ) are then almost uniform across the gap and are simply given by : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the height of the couette cell .",
    "the viscosity @xmath18 of the sample can thus be computed from the rheological data @xmath13 and @xmath15 by @xmath19 , as long as the flow remains laminar and stationary .        in complex fluids ,",
    "the picture of the couette flow may be radically different .",
    "for instance , when a complex fluid is confined between two plates and depending on the roughness properties of the plates , the fluid velocity close to the walls may strongly differ from that of the walls ( see fig .",
    "[ f.exs](b ) ) : the fluid _",
    "slips_. slippage is usually explained by the existence of two thin lubricating layers in which the fluid structure is very different from that in the bulk .",
    "for instance , in a colloidal suspension , electrostatic or steric effects next to the walls may induce a depletion of the particles on a small distance , leaving a much less viscous fluid film at the walls and leading to this apparent wall slip @xcite .",
    "in concentrated oil - in - water emulsions , wall slip is due to the presence of very thin water layers close to the walls .",
    "even if the bulk fluid remains newtonian , the velocity profile between the two plates may be quite different from that expected in a uniformly sheared fluid that does not slip ( see fig .",
    "[ f.exs](a ) ) .",
    "wall slip in complex fluids raises important industrial problems and is often difficult to detect and to assess quantitatively . in particular , computing the viscosity from eqs .",
    "( [ e.gammarheo ] ) and ( [ e.sigmarheo ] ) can be very misleading since the effective shear rate in the bulk is sometimes orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "moreover , even in the absence of wall slip and even for newtonian fluids , above a critical rotation speed of the rotor , the laminar flow becomes unstable and vortices develop due to the centrifugal force ( _ taylor - couette instability _ ) . upon further increasing the rotation speed",
    ", this three - dimensional , inhomogeneous but still stationary flow turns into a time - dependent turbulent flow @xcite .",
    "the procedure based on eqs .",
    "( [ e.gammarheo ] ) and ( [ e.sigmarheo ] ) for measuring @xmath13 and @xmath15 and computing the viscosity then completely fails because the flow is no longer laminar and stationary .",
    "about fifteen years ago , complex fluids such as entangled polymer solutions were shown to present inhomogeneous flows even when sheared at rotor velocities far below the onset of the taylor - couette instability .",
    "these unstable flows result from purely _ elastic instabilities _ @xcite .",
    "although due to the elasticity of the fluid rather than visco - inertial effects , the phenomenology of such instabilities is very similar to classical hydrodynamic instabilities but occur at very low reynolds numbers .      beside those inertial and elastic instabilities , more subtle effects may come into play that are due to the very nature of complex fluids .",
    "indeed , application of shear to a complex fluid may completely change its microstructure leading to a new _ shear - induced structure_. such a phenomenon may be called a _ shear - induced transition _ or a _ material instability _ in the sense that it results from a strong coupling between the shear flow and the microstructure of the fluid @xcite .",
    "a material instability usually shows up on rheological data as a sudden jump in the viscosity when shear is increased .",
    "for instance , if the shear - induced structure is much less viscous than the complex fluid at low shear , then a large drop of the visocity may be observed and the transition is called a shear - thinning transition . during such a transition , the fluid is assumed to phase - separate into two states : a shear - induced state that flows at a given shear rate and coexists with the old structure , thus giving rise to two shear bands @xcite .",
    "the corresponding _ shear - banded _",
    "velocity profile is sketched in fig .",
    "[ f.exs](c ) .    in order to investigate those transitions ,",
    "most previous studies have focused on global measurements such as the viscosity of the sample as a function of time @xcite .",
    "indeed , the time series @xmath21 sometimes display complex temporal fluctuations on time scales characteristic of the microstructure rearrangements .",
    "however , such global measurements do not provide any information on the spatial structure of the flow @xcite .",
    "thus , other studies have focused on the local characterization of the fluid structure using birefringence neutron , x - ray or light scattering and showed the coexistence of bands of different microstructures in the vicinity of shear - induced transitions @xcite .",
    "as far as the flow field is concerned , rather few local velocity measurements are reported in the complex fluid literature @xcite .",
    "the presence of inhomogeneous flows in some surfactant mixtures ( `` wormlike micelles '' ) was first unveiled using nmr @xcite .",
    "however , the existence of shear bands in the velocity profiles was firmly ascertained only recently using dynamic light scattering ( dls ) in heterodyne mode , a technique close to ldv @xcite .    from the various examples cited above ,",
    "it is quite clear that local measurements are essential , for instance to precisely follow the shear bands in both space and time . in general , a velocity profile with about 20 points accross a 1  mm gap , _",
    "i.e. _ with a resolution of 50  @xmath0 m , will carry enough spatial information on the flow to allow quantitative conclusions on possible inhomogeneous flow profiles .",
    "contrary to electromagnetic waves , the _ phase _ of acoustic waves is easily accessible using piezoelectric transducers . moreover",
    ", ultrasound may propagate deeply into optically opaque media .",
    "these two properties have led to the spectacular development of ultrasonic imaging techniques since the early 1950s particularly in the _ biomedical _ domain .",
    "when an ultrasonic wave travels through biological tissues , it gets scattered by density and/or compressibility inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "if the scatterer moves in a flow , like for instance red blood cells inside blood vessels , its motion induces a doppler shift in the wave frequency .",
    "early systems for measuring blood velocities were based on the estimation of this doppler frequency shift using a monochromatic ultrasonic wave @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , even if these `` true doppler '' systems helped to detect the occlusion of blood vessels , they did not offer any spatial resolution . indeed ,",
    "if one uses a continuous wave , one gets a very good resolution on the frequency shift ( and thus on the velocity ) but one also loses any temporal information on the echo arrival time ( and thus on the scatterer position , as explained below ) .",
    "continuous doppler systems may thus be very efficient in the case of a single scatterer suspended in a flow whose position is measured independently @xcite .      in order to discriminate between different scatterers in space and to measure velocity profiles , a solution is to use short acoustic _",
    "pulses_. indeed , if an ultrasonic pulse is sent by a transducer through a scattering medium , a series of backscattered echoes can be recorded on the same transducer .",
    "the precise nature of the backscattered ( bs ) signal will be discussed at length in sec .",
    "[ s.usv ] . at this point , it is only important to note that the arrival times @xmath22 of the echoes are directly linked to the position @xmath23 of the scatterer along the acoustic beam by @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the effective sound speed and the factor 2 accounts for the round trip from the transducer to the @xmath26 inhomogeneity and back to the transducer .",
    "the idea is then to follow the scatterer motion through the evolution of the bs signals : between successive pulses , echoes will move along with the flow and their positions may be tracked in time .",
    "although the doppler effect is not used in pulsed wave systems , these are still mistermed `` pulsed doppler systems '' in the literature and the technique is referred to as `` ultrasonic doppler velocimetry '' ( udv ) or `` ultrasonic velocity profiler '' ( uvp ) @xcite .",
    "this confusion may be due to the fact that , owing to the constraint of real - time display in commercial devices , bs signals are sampled only at a few given depths and that these sampled signals are analyzed in the frequency domain @xcite .",
    "udv has been successfully applied to various classical problems in hydrodynamics such as the taylor - couette instability @xcite , cylinder wakes @xcite , or magnetic fluid flows @xcite .",
    "the fluid has to be seeded with small particles that scatter ultrasound .",
    "such acoustic `` contrast agents '' are assumed to follow the flow as lagrangian tracers .",
    "the uvp has also been used fairly recently for in - line rheological studies of concentrated suspensions in pipe flows @xcite .",
    "if one drops the constraint of real - time display , the whole bs signals may be stored for post - processing .",
    "direct tracking of the bs signals in the time domain is the subject of recent technical developments such as ultrasonic speckle velocimetry which will be addressed in the next section .",
    "when the moving medium contains a lot of scatterers per unit volume , the bs signal results from the interferences of all the backscattered waves and appears as a complex , high - frequency signal called _ ultrasonic speckle _ ( see fig .  [ f.signal ] for a typical speckle signal and sec .",
    "[ s.analysis ] for more details , in particular about the possibility of multiple scattering ) .",
    "the development of fast digitizers with large memories has allowed the full recording of backscattered bs signals for post - processing .",
    "various time - domain algorithms for tracking the motion of ultrasonic echoes have been proposed @xcite .",
    "so far , such _ speckle tracking _",
    "techniques have mainly been applied to the measurement of tissue motion or blood flow @xcite .",
    "they have also been adapted to the uvp system and tested on pipe flows to provide high time resolution ( of about 0.5  ms per profile ) @xcite .",
    "recently , one of us introduced a combination of a 2d echographic system and speckle tracking that we called 2d ultrasonic speckle velocimetry ( usv ) @xcite .",
    "this system allowed us to image strong vortical flows in newtonian fluids in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "here we propose to adapt such a technique to complex fluids confined in a couette cell of gap @xmath27  mm .",
    "as explained in section  [ ss.inhom ] , one needs to measure velocity profiles with a spatial resolution of typically 50  @xmath0 m .",
    "however , frequencies commonly used in commercial ultrasonic velocimeters are in the range @xmath2810  mhz , and with a typical sound speed @xmath29  m.s@xmath30 , this yields a resolution of about @xmath311.5  mm .",
    "thus , conventional ultrasound does not permit very fine measurements and one has to turn to utrasound with frequencies larger than 20  mhz .",
    "again , high frequencies have first attracted the biomedical community .",
    "high - resolution ultrasonic images have been recently obtained in dermatology , ophtalmology and stomatology @xcite or for measuring blood flow in the microcirculation @xcite . to our knowledge , no such high - frequency measurements ( above 20  mhz ) have been reported so far in classical hydrodynamics nor in the field of complex fluids .",
    "note that the resolution can not be increased indefinitely by increasing the frequency because _ attenuation _ of sound waves sharply increases with frequency ( as @xmath32 in water ) .",
    "attenuation is due to the combination of thermo - viscous absorption and scattering .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio rapidly deteriorates as @xmath33 increases .",
    "we found that for our application to complex fluids , @xmath34  mhz realizes a good compromise between resolution and attenuation over propagation distances of a couple of centimeters .",
    "finally , since transducer arrays are not available at such a high frequency , the technique will have to be restricted to one - dimensional measurements .",
    "figure [ f.system ] presents our usv electronic system .",
    "focused ultrasonic pulses are generated by a pvdf piezo - polymer immersion transducer of central frequency @xmath34  mhz ( panametrics pi 50 - 2 ) .",
    "the focal distance is 11.6  mm and the active element diameter is 6.3  mm .",
    "the transducer bandwidth is 11 mhz at -3  db .",
    "the axial and lateral resolutions given by the manufacturer at -3  db are 30  @xmath0 m and 65  @xmath0 m respectively and the depth of field is about 1  mm .",
    "the transducer is controlled by a pulser - receiver unit ( panametrics 5900pr ) .",
    "the pulser generates 220  v  pulses with a rise time of about 1  ns .",
    "the pulse repetition frequency ( prf ) is tunable from 0 to 20  khz .",
    "the receiver is equipped with a 200  mhz broadband amplifier of maximum voltage gain 54  db as well as a set of selectable high - pass and low - pass filters .",
    "bs signals are sampled at @xmath35  mhz , stored on a high - speed pci digitizer with 8 mb on - board memory ( acqiris dp235 ) , and later transferred to the host computer for post - processing .",
    "the shear flow is generated in a plexiglas couette cell with @xmath36  mm , @xmath37  mm , and @xmath38  mm .",
    "the rotation of the inner cylinder is controlled by a standard rheometer ( ta instruments ar1000 ) .",
    "the whole cell is surrounded by water whose temperature is kept constant to within @xmath39c . the thickness of the stator is 2  mm everywhere except for a small rectangular window where the minimal thickness is 0.5  mm in order to avoid additional attenuation due to the plexiglas .",
    "ultrasonic pulses are incident on the stator with a given angle @xmath40 relative to the normal to the window in the stator as sketched in fig .",
    "[ f.setup ] .",
    "they travel through plexiglas and enter the gap with an angle @xmath41 that is given by the law of refraction . since the sound speed of the working fluid may differ from that of water , and since the precise value of @xmath41 depends on the exact arrangement of the acoustic beam relative the stator , @xmath41 will be taken as an unknown until a careful calibration procedure is completed ( see section  [ s.calib ] ) .",
    "once inside the fluid , ultrasonic pulses get scattered by inhomogeneities that can be either naturally present ( oil droplets in an emulsion for instance ) or artificially introduced to enhance the acoustic contrast . the total round trip for a pulse travelling from the transducer to the rotor and back to the transducer lasts about 15  @xmath0s .",
    "the position of the transducer is tuned so that the 1  mm gap lies into the focal spot in order to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "typical recorded bs signals are 1000 point long , which corresponds to a transit time of 2  @xmath0s or equivalently to a depth of roughly 1.5  mm inside the medium . allowing for a fraction of a millimeter before the stator and after the rotor helps to locate the two walls .",
    "note that spurious reflections on water  plexiglas or plexiglas  fluid interfaces are minimized by carefully choosing the angle @xmath42 . in any case",
    ", even in the absence of interfaces , such an angle is necessary to get a non - zero projection of the velocity vector along the acoustic axis as explained below .",
    "figure  [ f.signal ] shows a typical signal backscattered by a dilute suspension of polystyrene spheres and normalized by the maximum amplitude .",
    "the noise level is about 10  mv in all our experiments and typical signal amplitudes are in the range 50200  mv corresponding to a signal - to - noise ratio of 1030  db .    under the assumption of _ single scattering _ , the speckle signal received between times @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be interpreted as interferences coming from scatterers located between @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath45 is the distance from the transducer along the acoustic beam .",
    "the approximation that no multiple scattering takes place is thus essential in order to use the echographic conversion rule @xmath47 .",
    "multiple scattering is avoided by carefully controlling the amount and the properties of the scatterers ( see sec .",
    "[ s.calib ] ) .    when the fluid is submitted to a shear flow , the interference pattern changes as the scatterers move along .",
    "figure  [ f.signal_zoom ] shows two signals corresponding to two pulses separated by @xmath49  ms and plotted over 4 acoustic periods . a global shift to the right of @xmath50",
    "ns is clearly visible . with @xmath29  m.s@xmath30",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath51 m and to a velocity @xmath52  mm.s@xmath30 projected along the acoustic axis .",
    "in order to get an accurate estimate of the time - shift @xmath53 , we use the simple cross - correlation algorithm described below .",
    "two consecutive signals @xmath54 and @xmath55 recorded after pulses sent at times @xmath56 and @xmath57 are cross - correlated over small time windows of width @xmath58s , where @xmath59 is the acoustic period . more precisely , the following cross - correlation coefficient is computed according to : @xmath60 where the @xmath61 time window is centered around @xmath62 and @xmath63s is a reference time that corresponds to the beginning of the gap .",
    "@xmath64 depends on experimental parameters such as the working temperature and on the exact arrangement of the transducer relative to the couette cell ( see sec .  [ s.calib ] ) .",
    "the times @xmath22 correspond to the centers of the various time windows over which the signals are split . they will be later converted into positions @xmath23 at which the velocity is measured using @xmath65 .",
    "such windows correspond to slices of width @xmath66 m along the acoustic axis separated by @xmath67 m .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.correl ] , the correlation function @xmath68 is then interpolated around its main maximum by a parabola and the value @xmath53 of @xmath69 that maximizes this parabola is extracted : @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the parabolic interpolation of @xmath72 .",
    "note that @xmath53 depends both on the position @xmath22 of the time window ( fast `` ultrasonic time '' ) and on the time @xmath56 for which the cross - correlation is performed ( slow `` pulse time '' ) .",
    "thus @xmath53 will be noted as a function of the two variables @xmath22 and @xmath56 below .    finally , it is straightforward to convert time - shifts @xmath53 into velocities using : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the position of the center of the window along the acoustic axis . the origin @xmath75 is taken at the stator  fluid interface .",
    "equation  ( [ e.vy ] ) thus yields the projection @xmath76 of the velocity vector along the acoustic axis at the discrete positions @xmath23 and at time @xmath56 .      the procedure based on the interpolation of @xmath68 allows us to measure time - shifts as small as @xmath77  ns that correspond to displacements @xmath78 m .",
    "since the prf @xmath79 can be made as small as desired , infinitesimal velocities could in principle be measured .",
    "however , at very small shear rates , decorrelation of the bs signals may occur due to brownian motion of the scatterers or to low - frequency mechanical vibrations in the experimental setup .",
    "consequently , we will avoid using prfs smaller than 10  hz and we estimate the minimum measurable velocity at about 1  @xmath0m.s@xmath30 .",
    "on the other hand , the maximum measurable velocity is reached when @xmath80 m .",
    "indeed , displacements greater than the acoustic wavelength can not be measured using the cross - correlation algorithm described above unless phase unwrapping and continuity conditions are implemented , which will not be considered here @xcite . with the highest achievable prf @xmath81  khz",
    ", a 40  @xmath0 m maximum displacement means that velocities above 0.8  m.s@xmath30 may not be accessed using usv .",
    "note however that this limiting range of [ 1  @xmath0m.s@xmath30  0.8  m.s@xmath30 ] applies to the velocity @xmath76 projected along the acoustic axis .",
    "this range may be extended by varying the incidence angle @xmath41 ( see sec .",
    "[ s.conversion ] and eqs .",
    "( [ e.v])([e.x ] ) below ) .",
    "finally , eq .  ( [ e.vy ] ) shows that a velocity profile could in principle be obtained by cross - correlating only two successive bs signals _",
    "i.e. _ within a time interval @xmath83 that can be made very small depending of the prf . in practice , as seen on fig .",
    "[ f.signal ] , the speckle amplitude is never uniform .",
    "locally , destructive interferences or the absence of scatterers may lead to signal levels too small to be analyzed ( see the signal of fig .",
    "[ f.signal ] around @xmath84 or @xmath85s for instance ) .",
    "time windows where the signal amplitude does not reach a given threshold ( typically 20  % of the maximum amplitude ) are thus left out of the analysis . to recover a full velocity profile , some averaging",
    "is then performed over several sucessive cross - correlations : @xmath86    figure  [ f.data ] shows twenty successive bs signals recorded in a sheared newtonian suspension with @xmath87  khz .",
    "the ultrasonic pulses leave the stator and enter the gap at @xmath63s and a small fixed echo corresponding to the rotor position may be seen at @xmath88s ( as well as a stronger echo at about 15.2  @xmath0s that corresponds to a multiple reflection from the plexiglas window in the stator ) .",
    "the slopes of the traces left by the echoes in this two - dimensional @xmath89 diagram are inversely proportional to the local velocities according to eq .",
    "( [ e.vy ] ) .",
    "thus , the signature of shear is rather clear : velocities increase from the stator , where the scatterers remain almost fixed , to the rotor .",
    "moreover , the presence of moving echoes for times @xmath90 is not surprising : these echoes simply correspond to scattering of the wave reflected on the rotor .",
    "one can see that the whole range of times from @xmath64 to @xmath91 gets covered by some significant speckle signal in about 20  ms in that case .",
    "if better accuracy is required , more averaging can be performed to improve the statistical convergence of the method ( see fig .",

    ", we found that usv allows us to obtain a full velocity profile every 0.022  s.",
    "in order to test and calibrate the experiment , much effort was devoted to developing `` contrast agents '' that feature good scattering properties for high - frequency usv .",
    "indeed , too weak a scatterer yields a signal level too low to work with , whereas too strong a scatterer leads to multiple scattering .",
    "when the scatterer is small compared to the acoustic wavelength ( rayleigh approximation ) , three parameters control the amount of scattering : the scatterer diameter , its compressibility and its density @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if one wants the contrast agents to remain lagrangian tracers of the flow , their density has to be matched to that of the fluid .",
    "we found that homemade polystyrene spheres of diameter @xmath9210",

    "let us now turn to an application of high - frequency usv to a complex fluid .",
    "we chose to test usv in a lyotropic lamellar phase composed of sds ( 6.5  % wt . ) , octanol ( 7.8  % wt . ) and brine ( 20  g.l@xmath30 nacl ) .",
    "this surfactant mixture is known to display a series of structural shear - induced transitions @xcite . at equilibrium ,",
    "the system is composed of surfactant bilayers stacked with a smectic distance of about 15  nm . under shear flow ,",
    "this lamellar phase was shown to form a closely packed assembly of multilamellar vesicles @xcite .",
    "the diameter of these vesicles , commonly called `` onions , '' is typically a few microns .    at low shear velocities ,",
    "the diffraction pattern observed with light scattering is an isotropic ring indicating the absence of any positional order .",
    "however , when the velocity @xmath96 is increased , bragg peaks appear in the diffraction pattern showing the apparition of long - range order in the vesicle positions . as sketched in fig .",
    "[ f.transit ] , this disorder - to - order transition corresponds to a sharp drop in the sample viscosity by a factor of about 3 @xcite .",
    "such a shear - thinning transition is also observed in colloidal suspensions and is called a `` layering '' transition @xcite . as explained in sec .",
    "[ ss.inhom ] , inhomogeneous velocity profiles are expected in the vicinity of this shear - induced transition where the two states ( ordered and disordered states ) may coexist in the gap of a couette cell .    as for its ultrasonic behavior ,",
    "the `` onion '' assembly does not scatter 36  mhz pulses .",
    "thus , the lamellar phase was seeded with the polystyrene spheres used in sec .",
    "[ s.calib ] in order to get some speckle signal from the fluid .",
    "we checked that the `` layering '' transition is not significantly modified by the addition of such contrast agents .",
    "figure  [ f.photos ] presents two pictures of the seeded lamellar phase as seen under crossed polarizers and after shearing : the granular texture characteristic of disordered multilamellar vesicles does not seem perturbed by the addition of polystyrene spheres at 1  %  wt .      as shown on fig .",
    "[ f.soundspeed ] , the sound speed of the seeded lamellar phase was measured to be @xmath124  m.s@xmath30 .",
    "since the experiments and the calibration are performed at the same temperature and since the sound speeds of both fluids are the same ( within less than 1  % ) , we used @xmath95  m.s@xmath30 , @xmath125s and @xmath113 to obtain the velocity profiles shown in figs .",
    "[ f.lam1 ] and [ f.lam2 ] .",
    "the two main features of the velocity profiles are as follows :    [ [ wall - slip .",

    "@xmath126 may differ from @xmath96 by more than 30  % .",
    "one can also notice that slip velocities are comparable at the rotor and at the stator for the smallest rotor velocity but become highly dissymmetric when @xmath127  mm.s@xmath30 .",
    "a detailed study of wall slip in this system is left for future work .    [ [ shear - banding . ] ] shear banding .",
    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + +    figure [ f.lam1 ] also unveils the presence of shear bands when @xmath128  mm.s@xmath30 .",
    "a highly sheared band nucleates close to the rotor and progressively fills the gap as @xmath96 is increased ( see fig .",
    "[ f.lam2 ] for the highest velocities ) . the shear rate in the high shear band is about three times larger than that in the low shear band .",
    "this ratio remains roughly constant as long as two bands coexist . for @xmath129  mm.s@xmath30",
    ", the highly sheared region has invaded the whole gap .",
    "when @xmath130",
    "mm.s@xmath30 , the flow is laminar again and looks similar to that observed before the `` layering '' transition at @xmath131  mm.s@xmath30 .",
    "simultaneously to the present ultrasonic measurements , dls data obtained in our group have confirmed the existence of shear - banded flows and strong wall slip effects in the same lamellar phase without seeding polystyrene particles @xcite .",
    "this last observation shows _ a posteriori _ that our `` contrast agents '' do not perturb the flow and can be treated as simple lagrangian tracers . both usv and dls data are in good qualitative agreement with classical theoretical pictures of shear - banded flows @xcite .",
    "our purpose here is only to show the relevance of high - frequency usv in the field of sheared complex fluids and a more quantitative analysis of shear banding in light of dls results can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally let us show how usv may be used to follow the dynamics of a complex fluid under shear .",
    "until now , we have considered time - averaged velocity profiles . however ,",
    "during the `` layering '' transition , noticeable fluctuations of the flow field occur and result in large error bars for @xmath132 or 29.4  mm.s@xmath30 for instance .",
    "actually , some very rich dynamics were reported in this sheared lamellar phase when the _ torque _ applied on the rotor is imposed instead of the _ velocity _",
    "@xcite . in that case , the viscosity @xmath21 displays large , complex fluctuations on long time scales of the order of 100  s. similar ( although faster ) temporal behaviors were also observed in other surfactant systems @xcite .    the origin of these fluctuations and their precise statistical properties remain unclear .",
    "one possibility is that the flow presents shear bands that may couple to each other and lead to the observed behavior of the viscosity .",
    "thus the dynamics could be not only temporal as observed on @xmath21 but also spatial as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "figure  [ f.lam3 ] shows a transient regime recorded after the torque applied to the rotor was suddenly increased from 83 to 87  mn at time @xmath133 .",
    "the response of the rotor velocity @xmath134 is shown in fig .",
    "[ f.lam3](a ) @xcite .",
    "a maximum of about 38  mm.s@xmath30 is reached at @xmath135  s before @xmath134 slowly relaxes with small fluctuations .",
    "velocity profiles recorded during that transient show that : ( i ) during the initial increase of @xmath134 , a shear - banded flow is generated with _",
    "three _ bands : two highly sheared bands at both the rotor and the stator and a low shear region in between ( see fig .",
    "[ f.lam3](b)(d ) ) ; ( ii ) the band located at the stator disappears when @xmath134 decreases , leaving only _ two _ bands similar to figs .",
    "[ f.lam1 ] and [ f.lam2 ] ( see fig .  [ f.lam3](e)(f ) ) ; ( iii ) states where the highly sheared band almost disappears can be observed ( see fig .  [ f.lam3](g ) ) even though the rotor velocity @xmath136  mm.s@xmath30 indicates that a band should extend over almost half the gap if the average picture at imposed @xmath96 remained valid when the torque is imposed ( see the @xmath137 symbols corresponding to @xmath138  mm.s@xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ f.lam1 ] ) .",
    "the above results show that high - frequency usv is a powerful tool for measuring velocity profiles in sheared complex fluids .",
    "we have successfully tested the technique on a lyotropic lamellar phase that undergoes a shear - induced `` layering '' transition .    when the rotor velocity , _",
    "i.e. _ the global shear rate , is imposed , shear banding is observed : time - averaged velocity profiles display a highly sheared region that nucleates from the rotor and progressively invades the gap as @xmath96 is increased .",
    "wall slip can also be very large especially during the transition , which makes global measurements such as the sample viscosity tricky to analyze .    moreover , usv allowed us to record velocity profiles in 1  s typically .",
    "this acquisition time is short enough ( compared to the intrinsic time scales of our complex fluid ) to follow the velocity profiles in time .",
    "we showed the existence of more complex , three - band flows during a transient at imposed torque _",
    "i.e. _ imposed shear stress .",
    "this raises the question of the structure of the flow during the spontaneous oscillations of the viscosity observed in the same lamellar phase @xcite .",
    "usv may thus provide a `` time - resolved '' tool for investigating spatially the dynamical behaviors of @xmath21 .      in this paper",
    ", we have shown that we were able to measure velocity profiles with a spatial resolution of about @xmath139 m and every 0.022  s. high - frequency usv compares very well with other local techniques for measuring flow fields .",
    "ldv , or equivalently dls , provides in principle a slightly better spatial resolution of 1050  @xmath0 m but only yields a pointlike measurement . in order to obtain a full velocity profile with ldv or dls",
    ", one has to mechanically scan the whole gap of the cell @xcite .",
    "this usually takes about 1  min and may raise major interpretation problems when the flow evolves on time scales shorter than 1  min .",
    "nmr appears as a very promising technique for complex fluids @xcite since no seeding is required and two - dimensional images of the flow are obtained .",
    "however , acquisition times are rather long too ( from about 20  s to more than an hour depending on the number of points in the image ) , making it rather difficult to access dynamical local information .",
    "the main drawback of usv is that it needs a good control of the scattering properties of the fluid and that it may require that the flow be seeded with contrast agents .",
    "unless their mechanical properties is strictly controlled , most concentrated suspensions or emulsions will lead to multiple scattering of high - frequency pulses .",
    "thus , further application of usv to other complex fluids will involve a careful study of their acoustic properties .",
    "however , we believe that usv is likely to extend the range of complex fluids in which local measurements may be performed , in particular to optically opaque fluids .      the biggest advantage of usv lies undoubtedly in its ability to perform nonintrusive velocity measurements fast enough to follow the dynamics of complex fluids under low shear . in principle , in an ideal scattering environment , the temporal resolution of usv could even get as short as 1  ms per measurement .",
    "future research directions on usv are as follows : ( i ) more measurements on seeded lamellar phases will be performed and compared to dls data ; more precisely , we will focus on the spatio - temporal flow dynamics in regimes where sustained oscillations of the viscosity are observed ; ( ii ) we will investigate shear flows of other fluids such as emulsions , gels , or granular pastes ; ( iii ) we also intend to apply high - frequency usv to the case of very small deformations in order to perform some `` local linear rheology '' and understand how a complex fluid starts to flow in the transition from linear to nonlinear rheology .    the authors wish to thank the `` cellule instrumentation '' at crpp for designing and building the mechanical parts of the experimental setup .",
