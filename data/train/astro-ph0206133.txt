    "uranium and thorium are regarded as potentially useful cosmochronometers because their long radioactive decay half - lives ( @xmath3th : 14.05 gyr , @xmath2u : 4.468 gyr ) are significant fractions of the expected age of the universe . all of the actinides , including uranium and thorium , are thought to be pure @xmath0-process elements , since the alternative neutron - capture process , the @xmath7-process , terminates at @xmath8bi .",
    "the excellent agreement of the relative abundances of neutron - capture elements in the extremely metal - poor ( @xmath9 } = - 3.1 $ ] ) , @xmath0-process - element - enhanced star cs  22892 - 052 with the solar @xmath0-process pattern initially suggested that thorium might serve as a precise cosmochronometer @xcite .",
    "the time that has passed since the production of the thorium that is now observed in the outer atmosphere of such an old halo star can be regarded as a hard lower limit on the age of the universe .- process ) species that have been incorporated into the outer atmosphere of a low - mass ( @xmath10 ) star that has not yet evolved past the giant branch stage of evolution , and hence is amenable to spectroscopic study . ]",
    "sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 ) estimated the age of this star to be @xmath11  gyr , comparing the measured th / eu ratio with an initial production ratio constrained by theory .",
    "this age limit , albeit with a rather large error bar , is in good agreement with the age limits derived by completely different techniques , e.g. , for globular clusters ( @xmath12  gyr ; carretta et al .",
    "2000 ) , for type ia supernovae ( @xmath13  gyr ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) , and from the shape of acoustic peaks in the cosmic microwave background spectrum ( @xmath14  gyr ; knox , christensen , & skordis 2001 ) .",
    "one advantage of the thorium chronology is that , once the initial and current values of th/@xmath0 in the star are specified , the age of the star depends only on the half - life of @xmath3th determined in the laboratory .",
    "that is , one is not forced to invoke complex ( and no doubt incomplete ) models of galactic chemical evolution , although insight from making simple attempts can still be obtained ( e.g. , cowan et al .",
    "1997 ) . here",
    ", @xmath0 denotes one of the stable @xmath0-process elements , often taken to be eu . in the most simple model",
    ", the initial value of th/@xmath0 may be regarded as that arising from a single supernova that exploded in the near vicinity ( and perhaps may have even triggered the formation of ) the presently observed star , e.g. , cs  22892 - 052 , early in the history of the galaxy .",
    "in fact , the large dispersion of eu / fe observed in halo stars ( more than 2 orders of magnitude ) has been naturally explained by chemical evolution models that make such assumptions @xcite .",
    "thus far , the initial production of th/@xmath0 has been determined by fitting theoretical nucleosynthesis results to the solar @xmath0-process pattern , with the assumption that the @xmath0-pattern was _ universal _ in all astrophysical environments @xcite .",
    "however , a recent abundance analysis of cs  22892 - 052 with keck  i ( hires ) has shown that the lighter neutron - capture elements ( @xmath15 ) are distinctly underabundant with respect to the solar pattern , which is well fit by species with @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "this implies that there likely exists at least two @xmath0-process sites that must be invoked to account for the entire set of elements associated with the @xmath0-process @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it should be noted that although johnson & bolte ( 2001 ) have derived an estimate of the minimum age of the universe , @xmath17 gyr , based on the abundances of thorium and other stable neutron - capture elements in five metal - poor stars , the estimated ages of these stars are very widely spread , from @xmath18 to 18  gyr ( with overlapping error bars ) .",
    "in addition , recent spectroscopic studies of several extremely metal - poor halo stars with subaru ( hds ) has revealed that the spread of estimated chronometric ages from the th - eu pair appears to exceed the abundance uncertainties ( honda et al .",
    "2002 , in preparation ) .",
    "taken at face value , these results imply that the universality of the @xmath0-pattern may not hold over the actinides either .",
    "the second discovered @xmath0-process - enhanced , extremely metal - poor star , cs  31082 - 001 ( @xmath9 } = -2.9 $ ] ) has provided a new , potentially quite powerful cosmochronometer , uranium @xcite . in principle , uranium might be expected to be a more precise chronometer than thorium owing to its shorter half life .",
    "cayrel et al . (",
    "2001 ) concluded that the age of this star is @xmath19  gyr , based on comparisons of the observed ratios of u / th , u / os , and u / ir with their estimated production ratios @xcite .",
    "the discovery of uranium in cs  31082 - 001 has also prompted additional laboratory work to refine the oscillator strengths , for both uranium and thorium ( nilsson et al .",
    "2002a , b ) , that are required to turn spectroscopic observations into measured abundances .",
    "however , analysis of this star has also provided conclusive evidence that the @xmath0-process pattern is _ not universal _ over the actinides ; the ratio th / eu in this star is _ higher _ than that of the solar @xmath0-process ratio .",
    "cs  31082 - 001 would be younger than the solar system if the initial th / eu were taken to be universal , in conflict with the ages derived from ratios involving u and other stable @xmath0-process elements close to the third @xmath0-process peak .",
    "therefore , any age estimates that demand assumption of the universality of the @xmath0-process pattern may in fact be unreliable .",
    "in addition to the above non - universality problem , the initial @xmath0-process pattern has thus far been determined theoretically by the superposition of nucleosynthesis results , where one is forced to assume constant temperatures , neutron number densities , and exposure times ( or the number of captured neutrons )  the most recent exploration of this approach is presented in schatz et al .",
    "these approximations have been necessary because of the lack of a reliable astrophysical model for the @xmath0-process site ( at least that associated with the heavy @xmath0-process elements ) . at the moment ,",
    "the neutrino - wind scenario is considered to be the most promising , ever since the work by woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , although alternative models involving neutron - star mergers have also shown some promise @xcite .",
    "however , even the neutrino - wind model encounters serious problems , e.g. , the high entropy ( @xmath20 ) that led to the robust @xmath0-processing in the woosley et al .",
    "scenario has not been duplicated by other work @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is , therefore , to construct a realistic @xmath0-process model based on the neutrino - wind scenario , in order to derive initial production ratios that might be useful for estimation of the minimum age of the universe , in particular by use of the u - th chronometer pair .",
    "recently , wanajo et al . (",
    "2001 ) have demonstrated that the solar @xmath0-process pattern for @xmath21 is well reproduced in such a model from a compact proto - neutron star , owing to the inclusion of general relativistic effects .",
    "although recent hydrodynamic studies have encountered difficulties attaining the required compactness , we use their model along with some improvements to be discussed in   2 .",
    "although some severe problems yet remain , it is clearly important to determine the initial @xmath0-process pattern based on site - specific , rather than only site - independent , models . in",
    "  3 the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis calculation is described , and the results are compared to the solar @xmath0-process pattern . the initial electron fraction , @xmath22 , is varied from 0.39 to 0.49 , but taken constant with time during the neutron - capture process . in   4 , the age of cs  31082 - 001 is derived by comparison of the nucleosynthesis results obtained for each @xmath22 with the abundance pattern of heavy elements in this star .",
    "the implications of this study are discussed in  5 .",
    "neutrino winds , in which the free nucleons accelerated by the intense neutrino flux near the neutrino sphere of a core - collapse supernovae assemble to heavier nuclei , has been believed to be the most promising astrophysical site of the @xmath0-process since the work by woosley et al .",
    "the rather high entropy ( @xmath23 @xmath24 ) of the ejected matter in their hydrodynamic simulations led to production of the @xmath0-process elements that is in remarkable agreement with the solar @xmath0-process pattern .",
    "however , subsequent analysis of both hydrodynamic and analytic approaches suggests that such high entropy may not be achieved in neutrino winds ( @xmath25 @xmath24 ; takahashi et al .",
    "1994 ; qian & woosley 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , an unacceptable overproduction of the elements with @xmath26 appeared in the @xmath0-process yields of woosley et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .    recently , otsuki et al .",
    "( 2000 ) have studied the physical conditions required for the @xmath0-process in detail , using a semi - analytic model of a spherical , steady neutrino wind , taking general relativistic effects into account ( see also qian & woosley 1996 ; cardall & fuller 1997 ; thompson , burrows , & meyer 2001 ) .",
    "they suggested that robust physical conditions for the @xmath0-process were obtained only if the proto - neutron star was as massive as @xmath27 .",
    "furthermore , wanajo et al . ( 2001 ) showed from nucleosynthesis calculations that the @xmath0-process yields for the compact proto - neutron star models ( with a mass of @xmath28 and radius of 10 km ) were in good agreement with the solar @xmath0-process pattern .",
    "this agreement was achieved due to the short dynamical timescale ( @xmath29 msec ) and moderately high entropy ( @xmath30 @xmath24 ) obtained at the early phase of the neutrino wind , which prevents most of the free nucleons to assemble into heavy nuclei .",
    "there are , however , some severe problems in their models . for example",
    ", it would appear difficult to obtain such a compact proto - neutron star with hydrodynamic models of core - collapse supernovae using the equations of state of high - density matter that are currently available .",
    "this model also suffered from significant overproduction of elements with @xmath26 .",
    "hence , although problems remain , we have chosen to begin with these models , and attempt to refine them in order to see if progress can be made toward the goal of obtaining more realistic production ratios of heavy elements that might prove useful for the u- and th- chronologies .    in this paper",
    "we use a model with a proto - neutron star with ( gravitational ) mass of @xmath4 and radius of 10 km , as in wanajo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , whose nucleosynthesis results are in good agreement with the solar @xmath0-pattern for nuclei @xmath31 .",
    "we briefly describe the models here , and point out some improvements that have been added .",
    "the system is treated as time stationary and spherically symmetric , and the radius of the neutron star is assumed to be the same as that of the neutrino sphere .",
    "the physical variables in the neutrino wind are then functions of the radius only . the ejected mass by neutrino heating is assumed to be negligible compared to the mass of the neutron star .",
    "therefore , the gravitational field in which the neutrino - heated matter moves can be treated as a fixed - background schwarzschild metric .",
    "time variations of the temperature and density are then solved by use of relations based on baryon , momentum , and energy conservation ( equations  ( 1)-(3 ) in wanajo et al .",
    "the source term in the equation of energy conservation is due to both heating and cooling by neutrino interactions .",
    "the gravitational redshift of the neutrino energies , and the bending of the neutrino trajectories expected from general relativistic effects , are explicitly taken into account .",
    "for the cooling by annihilation of electron - positron pairs into neutrino - antineutrino pairs , the accurate table of itoh et al .",
    "( 1996 ) is utilized .",
    "all other neutrino heating and cooling rates are taken from otsuki et al .",
    "the neutrino luminosities , @xmath32 , of all neutrino flavors are assumed to be equal , and the rms average neutrino energies are taken to be 12 , 22 , and 34  mev , for electron , anti - electron , and the other flavors of neutrinos , respectively .",
    "the equation of state for the electron and positron gas includes arbitrary relativistic pairs , which are of importance during @xmath33-processing .",
    "the electron fraction is set to be @xmath34 , which was mainly determined by the equilibrium of neutrino capture on free nucleons with the above luminosities and energies of the electron and anti - electron neutrinos at the neutrino sphere .    in this paper a _ freezeout temperature _",
    ", @xmath35 , is introduced to specify the final temperature of the neutrino winds . as can be seen in realistic hydrodynamic simulations of neutrino winds ,",
    "all trajectories specific to the @xmath0-process asymptotically approach the same temperature in the stalled shock @xcite . as discussed in   3 ,",
    "this assumption is also reasonable from the nucleosynthetic point of view .",
    "otsuki et al .",
    "( 2000 ) set the mass ejection rate , @xmath36 , at the neutrino sphere of each wind so that the temperature at 10000  km in radius is 0.1  mev .",
    "this assumption may be inadequate , as the physical conditions of the neutrino sphere and the outer boundary are not necessarily causally connected . on the other hand , wanajo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) set the mass ejection rate to be @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the maximum mass ejection rate at the neutrino sphere appropriate for the local physical conditions ( the wind with @xmath38 becomes supersonic through the sonic point , while those with @xmath39 are subsonic throughout ) .",
    "however , the asymptotic temperatures differed significantly from wind to wind , which is unlikely in a realistic situation . in this paper , therefore , we have specified both @xmath36 and @xmath35 to avoid the above problems .",
    "the mass ejection rate is set to be @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , recent hydrodynamic simulations show that the winds become supersonic , and then , in turn , decelerate to become subsonic from the effects of the reverse shock coming from the outer iron mantle @xcite .",
    "@xmath35 is set to be the same for all winds .",
    "the temperature , @xmath41 , of each wind is thus replaced with @xmath35 for all @xmath42 .",
    "the density is also replaced to that obtained at @xmath43 .",
    "the value of @xmath35 is determined in   3 .",
    "the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis calculation , adopting the model described above for the physical conditions , is obtained by application of an extensive nuclear - reaction network code .",
    "the network consists of @xmath44 species , all the way from single neutrons and protons up to the fermium isotopes ( @xmath45 , see figure  2 ) .",
    "we include all relevant reactions , i.e. , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and their inverses .",
    "reaction rates are taken from thielemann ( 1995 , private communication ) for nuclei with @xmath52 and from cowan , thielemann , & truran ( 1991 ) for those with @xmath53 .",
    "the latter used the mass formula by hilf et al .",
    "( 1976 ) .",
    "our network does not include the nuclei near the neutron drip line for @xmath54 , since no reliable data are yet available .",
    "terasawa et al . ( 2001 ) demonstrated that @xmath0-processing was hindered significantly by reaction flows near the neutron drip line for @xmath55 , owing to their rather low asymptotic temperature ( @xmath56  k ) .",
    "as we suggest below , however , it may be unlikely that the asymptotic temperature is , in reality , less than @xmath57  k. thus , inclusion of these reactions would not significantly change our conclusions .",
    "the three - body reaction @xmath58be , which is of special importance as the bottleneck reaction to heavier nuclei , is taken from the recent experimental data of utsunomiya et al .",
    "the weak interactions , such as @xmath59-decay , @xmath59-delayed neutron emission ( up to three neutrons ) , and electron capture are also included , although the latter is found to be unimportant .",
    "note that neutrino - induced reactions are not included .",
    "in fact , neutrino capture on free nucleons might be of importance , as they may serve to increase the electron fraction during seed element production @xcite , while those on heavy nuclei are likely to be unimportant . however , it would be meaningless to consider these effects without taking the accurate treatment of neutrino transport near the neutrino sphere into account .    the @xmath33-decay chains and spontaneous fission processes are taken into account only after the freezeout of all other reactions . for the latter , all nuclei with @xmath60",
    "are assumed to decay by spontaneous fission only .",
    "the few known nuclei undergoing spontaneous fission for @xmath61 are also included , along with their branching ratios .",
    "neutron - induced and @xmath59-delayed fissions , as well as the contribution of fission fragments to the lighter nuclei , are neglected .",
    "obviously , these treatments of the fission reactions are oversimplified .",
    "nevertheless , this may be acceptable , at least to first order , as we demonstrate below .",
    "we leave the more accurate treatment of these matters to future work .",
    "in particular , @xmath59-delayed fission may be of importance , as shown by schatz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "each calculation is started at @xmath62 ( where @xmath63  k ) . at this point",
    "the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) consists mostly of free nucleons .",
    "the initial mass fractions of neutrons and protons are thus given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 , respectively .",
    "in wanajo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the initial electron fraction @xmath22 was fixed to be 0.40 . in this paper @xmath22",
    "is varied from 0.39 to 0.49 to examine its effect on the @xmath0-process .",
    "note that , for simplicity , for each @xmath22 the same trajectories are used , being derived with @xmath66 .",
    "the small change of @xmath22 is , however , found to be unimportant for the temperature and density histories .",
    "the freezeout temperature , @xmath35 , is determined as follows . at present",
    ", there is no positive evidence that the @xmath0-process pattern between the @xmath0-process - enhanced stars ( e.g. , cs  31082 - 001 ) and the solar abundances differs for @xmath16 , except for th and u @xcite .",
    "thus , since our main goal is to estimate reliable yields of u and th , the local @xmath0-process pattern near the third peak ( @xmath67pt ) is treated most carefully , in order to reproduce the solar @xmath0-process pattern . in figure  1 the nucleosynthesis results before and after @xmath33-decay and fission ( thick line ) , obtained with different @xmath68  k ) , are compared to the solar @xmath0-process pattern ( points ; kppeler et al . 1989 ) normalized to the height of the third - peak nuclei .",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath22 are taken to be @xmath69  ergs  s@xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the thin line denotes the results obtained by turning off the process of @xmath59-delayed neutron emission .",
    "note that the local pattern of the @xmath0-element abundances ( i.e. , near @xmath72 ) is not significantly altered as the result of changing @xmath32 and @xmath22 ( see figures  4 and 5 ) .",
    "thus , the discussion below may hold even for superposition of the yields from multiple trajectories .    for @xmath73 ( figures  1a - c ) , the position of the third peak shifts to the low side by two units from @xmath72 .",
    "moreover , the valley on the lower side of the third peak seen in the solar @xmath0-process pattern ( @xmath74 ) is substantially filled up with the jagged pattern .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath75 ( figures  1g - i ) , the third peak significantly shifts to the high side from @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , the abundance pattern is unacceptably jagged compared to the solar @xmath0-process pattern . in this regard",
    ", the results with @xmath76 reproduce the properties of the solar @xmath0-pattern near the third peak quite well ( figures  1d - f ) .",
    "indeed , the third peak is correctly located at @xmath72 .",
    "the pattern in the valley at @xmath74 is also reasonably reproduced . in this paper , therefore , we set @xmath77 to be 1.0 , so that the predicted @xmath0-process pattern is in the best agreement with that of the solar @xmath0-process pattern near the third peak .",
    "note that the second peak ( @xmath78 ) nuclei in figure  1 are substantially underproduced compared to the solar @xmath0-abundances in this specific trajectory , which originates mainly from the higher @xmath32 trajectories ( figures  4 and 5 ) .    in table  1 ,",
    "the abundance ratios among eu , ir , pb , bi , th , and u are listed along with the isotope number fraction of @xmath79eu .",
    "note that , in this table , `` pb '' means the sum of @xmath80pb , @xmath81pb , @xmath82pb , and @xmath83u , while `` u '' means @xmath2u , owing to the short mean half - life of @xmath83u compared to the cosmic age .",
    "as can be seen , the ratio u / th is insensitive to the change of @xmath77 , except for the higher temperature cases with @xmath84 .",
    "this is simply due to the fact that th and u are close to one another in mass number .",
    "thus , small variations of @xmath77 from 1.0 may not change the chronometric ages substantially , as long as the u - th pair is employed .",
    "in contrast , other abundance ratios are found to be quite sensitive to the change of @xmath77 .",
    "for example , the ratio th / eu varies by more than a factor of two in the same temperature range .",
    "this implies that the chronometer pairs th-@xmath0 may be unreliable unless the astrophysical model is strictly constrained .",
    "it is interesting to note that the ratio between pb - bi and th - u can be changed by a factor of two even though they are mainly @xmath33-decay products",
    ".    the isotope ratio of eu can provide another constraint on the determination of @xmath77 .",
    "recent spectroscopic studies have shown that the isotope number fractions of a few extremely metal - poor stars , including cs  22892 - 052 @xcite and cs  31082 - 001 ( aoki et al . , in preparation ) are close to the solar value of 0.478 .",
    "this is also in good agreement with the calculated values for @xmath85 in the last column of table  1 .",
    "the strong influence of @xmath35 on the final predicted @xmath0-process pattern can be recognized as the consequence of the freezeout effects .",
    "figure  2 shows the post - freezeout evolution of the @xmath0-process abundances for @xmath86 with @xmath87  ergs  s@xmath70 and @xmath88 .",
    "the abundances are color - coded with their pattern as a function of mass number in the upper left .",
    "the dots denote the nuclei included in the reaction network , with the stable and long - lived nuclei shown as larger dots . at the freezeout of @xmath0-processing , which occurs",
    "0.48 seconds after @xmath62 , a clear odd - even effect appears , owing to the @xmath89 equilibrium ( figure  2a ) .",
    "after 0.58 seconds , the abundances near the third peak are still along the neutron magic number @xmath90 ( figure  2b ) . as a result ,",
    "the third peak slightly shifts to the larger side in mass number , due to the small fraction of neutrons emitted by photo - dissociation of fragile nuclei ( e.g. , @xmath91 ) and by the @xmath59-delayed process ; these are quickly absorbed by other nuclei ( including those near the third peak ) .",
    "the abundance valley at @xmath92 is then sharpened . at the same time",
    "the abundance pattern is significantly smoothed . at some point",
    "the abundances near the third peak separate from @xmath90 due to @xmath59-decay , becoming more and more robust against photo - dissociation , as well as with the decrease in the @xmath59-delayed process ( figure  2c ) .",
    "the position of the third peak is thus fixed .",
    "the abundance pattern is smoothed further by the continuation of non - equilibrium neutron emission and absorption among fragile nuclei .",
    "it is important to note that the separation from the @xmath90 line takes place at earlier times for lower @xmath35 , and vice versa , which determines the location of the third peak , as well as the smoothness of the pattern near it .",
    "although the @xmath59-delayed process is found to be unimportant for setting the locations of the second ( @xmath93 ) and the third ( @xmath94 ) peaks , it does contribute to the enhancement of nuclei with @xmath95 , in particular for @xmath96 , as can be seen in figure  1 .",
    "this results in the enhancement of th - u / pb - bi for @xmath97 found in table  1 .    in order to calculate the mass - integrated @xmath0-process yields , the time evolution of the neutrino luminosity , @xmath32 ,",

( 1994 ) . the time evolution of the neutrino sphere radius is also assumed to be @xmath103 , where @xmath104  km .",
    "@xmath105 is replaced with 10  km for @xmath106  km .",

    "the timescale , @xmath109 , is defined as the duration from 6 to 2.5 in @xmath110 , which approximately corresponds to the phase of @xmath33-processing , i.e. , the seed abundance production prior to @xmath0-processing .",
    "note that our definition of @xmath109 differs from the @xmath111-folding time of the density often taken in other work , since the latter is not necessarily a good indicator of the seed abundance production . for @xmath112  ergs  s@xmath70 , @xmath109 is significantly short ( @xmath113  msec ) and @xmath108 is moderately high ( @xmath114 ) , which are suitable conditions for the @xmath0-process ( preventing consumption of free neutrons prior to @xmath0-processing ) . for @xmath115",

    "this is perhaps due to the fact that our assumption of the steady - state flow does not hold well for @xmath117  ergs  s@xmath70 .",
    "this high luminosity phase is , however , unimportant for the @xmath0-process ( figure  4 ) .",

    "this is a consequence of the rather short timescale of seed abundance production ( @xmath122 , 7.5 , 11 msec ) and the high entropy per baryon ( @xmath123 , 154 , and 169 @xmath24 ) . for @xmath124 , 51.2 , and 51.0 , the second and the third peaks are still prominent , but",

    "the deficiency of nuclei at @xmath140 , seen for all @xmath22 cases , could be due to our insufficient treatment of the physics of the neutrino winds for @xmath141  ergs  s@xmath70 , in which the assumption of the steady state winds is not manifest at all .",
    "more likely , this might be due to the nuclear properties of the mass model @xcite employed in this study , as shown by freiburghaus et al .",
    "( 1999a ) . in their paper , calculations with other mass formulae , frdm @xcite and etfsi @xcite , were able to well reproduce the solar @xmath0-abundances in this mass region .",

    "this is due to the small levels of the seed abundance , owing to the extremely strong @xmath33-rich freezeout by the less efficient @xmath147be reaction with low neutron excess @xcite .    in table  2 ,",

    ", in preparation ) , even after mass - integration of the yields .",
    "the last column of table  2 shows the mass of fission fragments , whose contribution to the lighter nuclei is neglected in this study .",
    "this assumption appears adequate since the contribution of fission fragments is less than @xmath154 of the total mass of nuclei with @xmath155 .",
    "this follows since , in this study , the neutron - to - seed ratio at the onset of @xmath0-processing ( @xmath156 ) is 138 at most , with @xmath157 .",

    "note that some lighter elements ( rh , ag ) are not in agreement with the solar @xmath0-process pattern , as has also been seen in cs  22892 - 052 @xcite , and which implies the presence of two distinct @xmath0-process sites @xcite .",
    "nucleosynthesis results for all @xmath22 cases are in good agreement with the abundance pattern of cs  31082 - 001 for the elements between pr ( @xmath163 ) and tm ( @xmath164 ) , with the exception of tb .",
    "note that a few of the predicted abundances for elements near the second peak ( ba , la , and ce ) are significantly deficient compared to both the observational and solar patterns . as mentioned in   3",
    ", this might be due to the properties of the nuclear mass model employed in this study . in future work",
    "we plan to check if these elements are reproduced with other mass formulae , since the observational data suggest the universality of the @xmath0-process pattern between the second and the third @xmath0-process peaks . the platinum - peak elements os and ir are in reasonable agreement , except for the @xmath143 case , although the height of the @xmath67pt differs .",
    "in addition , the large abundance of os in cs  31082 - 001 compared to the scaled solar @xmath0-process pattern makes it questionable if the third peak is really located at pt",
    ". it would clearly be useful to obtain measurements of the pt abundance in this star , so that the height , as well as the position , of the third peak could be better constrained .",
    "note that @xmath83u is assumed to have @xmath33-decayed away because of its relatively short half life ( 0.704 gyr ) .",
    "as discussed by hill et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the age of cs  31082 - 001 can be inferred by application of one or more of the following three relations :    @xmath165\\ { \\rm gyr } \\\\",
    "t^*_{{\\rm u},r } & = &   14.84\\ , [ \\log ( { \\rm u}/r)_0 - \\log ( { \\rm u}/r)_{\\rm now}]\\ { \\rm gyr } \\\\ t^*_{{\\rm u , th } } & = &   21.76\\ , [ \\log ( { \\rm u / th})_0 - \\log ( { \\rm u / th})_{\\rm now}]\\ { \\rm gyr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the half lives of @xmath3th ( 14.05 gyr ) and @xmath2u ( 4.468 gyr ) , @xmath0 is a stable @xmath0-element , and the subscripts `` 0 '' and `` now '' denote the initial and current values derived by theory and observation , respectively . in principle , @xmath166 and @xmath167 can be more precise chronometers than @xmath168 , owing to the smaller coefficients in front of equations  ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) . in practice , the u - th pair ( equation  ( 3 ) ) is expected to be the most precise chronometer owing to the similar atomic properties of these species , which serve to diminish the observational errors associated with determination of their ratio .",
    "furthermore , the ratio u / th is less dependant on the theoretical model used , since these species are separated by only two units in atomic number , as well as being mostly the result of @xmath33-decayed products ( table  1 ) . as stable elements @xmath0 , eu , os , and ir are selected .",
    "the eu abundance derived by spectroscopic analyses is more reliable than for any other elements with @xmath169 .",
    "the pt - peak elements os and ir are co - produced with th and u in the same ( or close in @xmath32 ) trajectories , and thus are perhaps less model dependent as well .",
    "note that , if possible , the pb abundance in this star should be used , since it is mainly synthesized by the same @xmath33-decay chains as th and u. however , pb has not yet been detected in cs  31082 - 001 , and for now only an upper limit to its abundance is available . for reasons that are not yet clear , the upper bound on pb reported by hill et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is lower than the solar value , being satisfied only by the @xmath170 cases in which th and u are not significantly produced .",
    "thus , pb is omitted for the age determination in this study , although its future measurement would clearly be of importance .",
    "table  3 lists the predicted initial abundance ratios among eu , os , ir , pt , th , and u ( @xmath171 ) for all the @xmath22 cases considered in the present study .",
    "the ratio u / th is found to be insensitive to @xmath22 ( except for the extreme case of @xmath143 ) , which is in excellent agreement with those constrained by the solar @xmath0-process abundances in @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that these values can be applied not only to cs  31082 - 001 , but also to other metal - poor halo stars in which uranium and thorium ( and platinum ) are detected by future observations @xcite . with the use of these ratios as the initial values",
    ", the age of cs  31082 - 001 is derived as shown in table  4 , as well as in figure  7 .",
    "it is noteworthy that the age obtained from the u - th chronometer pair is considerably more robust than the alternatives , resulting in a range @xmath172  gyr , with an exception of 12.2  gyr for the @xmath143 case .",
    "therefore , we use only the u - th chronometer for dating of this star , while the others are regarded as consistency checks only .",
    "in particular , the th - eu pair should be used to constrain the model parameter @xmath22 in this study , the species being widely separated in mass number . for this reason , @xmath22 is constrained to be @xmath173 , owing to the consistency between ages based on the u - th pair and others ( especially th - eu ) .",
    "the ages obtained by use of os are significantly higher than those by others , because of the previously noted discrepancies between observation and the theoretical prediction ( figure  6 ) . as seen in table  4 , the difference between the ages obtained from u - th between @xmath174 and 0.41 is only 0.1  gyr .",
    "on the other hand , the observational error associated with the u / th ratio , 0.11 dex , leads to an uncertainty of 2.4  gyr from application of equation  ( 3 ) .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the age of cs  31082 - 001 is @xmath6  gyr .",
    "it should be emphasized that the age determination made in the present paper is derived from the exploration of a single specific model based on the neutrino - wind scenario , and relies as well on the choice of one of the many existing nuclear data sets .",
    "thus , it is clear that our final result may be changed if we were to make use of other astrophysical models .",
    "the nuclear mass models can also significantly affect the age determination @xcite .",
    "obviously , more study with other astrophysical models , as well as with a number of different nuclear data sets , are needed to derive the final results .",
    "we have constructed a robust model of the @xmath0-process based on the neutrino - wind scenario for application to the u - th cosmochronology .",
    "the model of neutrino winds was taken from otsuki et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and wanajo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , along with some improvements described above .",
    "the @xmath0-process with various neutron star masses ( @xmath175 ) and radii ( @xmath176 ) has already been explored extensively by wanajo et al .",
    "thus , @xmath175 and ( asymptotic ) @xmath105 were fixed to be @xmath4 and 10  km , respectively , for which the most robust @xmath0-processing was realized . on the other hand , the initial electron fraction @xmath22 ( assumed constant with time )",
    "was taken to be a free parameter , rather than fixed to be 0.40 as in wanajo et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "the model was tuned to fit the solar @xmath0-process pattern , since recent spectroscopic studies of extremely metal - poor stars have indicated a _ universal _ ( solar @xmath0-like ) abundance pattern , at least between the second and third r - process peaks . attention was paid to reproduce the pattern near @xmath177 , being close to th and u in mass number .",
    "we introduced the freezeout temperature , @xmath35 , as the most crucial parameter for constructing the model . comparing the nucleosynthesis results with the solar @xmath0-process pattern , @xmath35 was determined to be @xmath178",
    "k. the nucleosynthesis yields were mass - integrated assuming simple evolutions of @xmath32 and @xmath105 .",
    "the results between @xmath134 and 200 for @xmath133 models were in good agreement with the solar @xmath0-pattern , although the production of th and u differed from model to model .",
    "the results of our nucleosynthesis predictions were compared to the spectroscopic abundance pattern of the @xmath0-process - enhanced metal - poor star cs  31082 - 001 .",
    "explorations of various combinations between the actinides and stable isotopes indicated that the @xmath179 case was found to be the best models for the age determination in this study . as a result , the age of cs  31082 - 001 was determined to be @xmath6  gyr by use of the u - th chronometer , which can be regarded as a hard lower limit on the age of the universe .",
    "in fact , this age is in excellent agreement with the age of the universe derived by other dating techniques ( e.g. , globular clusters , type ia supernovae , and the cosmic - microwave background ) , as well as with other stellar radioactive age estimates using the th - eu @xcite and u - th @xcite pairs .",
    "such a strong constraint on the age of this star was only made possible by the use of u and th in conjunction with one another . without uranium ,",
    "the chronometers involving th alone presented only rather loose constraints .    in this",
    "study the pb abundance in cs  31082 - 001 was not available for age determination , since only an upper limit on its abundance has been presented to date .",
    "it should be noted that the predicted pb abundance for @xmath180 case is _ higher _ than this upper limit , which seems difficult to solve @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy , however , that freezeout effects can increase the ratio th - u / pb - bi ( see   3 ) , which should be examined further , as well as with other nuclear data sets .",
    "it remains possible that the solar @xmath0-process pb abundance , inferred from the residual of the solar @xmath7-process components , is not correct @xcite .",
    "clearly , re - investigation of the pb abundance in cs  31082 - 001 , as well expansion of the searches for additional @xmath0-process - enhanced metal - poor stars , in which both u and th are measurable , are highly desirable in the near future .",
    "it is also of importance to obtain measurements of the pt abundance in cs  31082 - 001 ( which is only possible with the strong pt absorption features observable in the near uv from space ) , so as to constrain the height , as well as the position , of the third peak @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the conclusions in this study should be considered as merely the first step toward a better understanding of the dating technique involving the u - th chronometer . in particular , we note that the inferred age of cs  31082 - 001 could be significantly changed if we had utilized a different nuclear mass model , as demonstrated by griely and arnould ( 2001 ) .",
    "we expect , however , that a detailed comparison of the nucleosynthesis results with the solar @xmath0-process pattern , as in   3 , can distinguish better mass models .",
    "we suggest that the freezeout temperature , @xmath35 ( or the asymptotic temperature in more realistic models ) , is a useful parameter , as the freezeout effects are of importance to the final @xmath0-process pattern .",
    "while the waiting - point approximation , often referred to as the `` classical @xmath0-process model , '' has been an effective ( and thus far , the only ) method used to test the nuclear mass models , we should keep in mind that non - equilibrium processes can lead to non - negligible effects , as discussed in   3 ( e.g. , the positions of the @xmath0-process peaks , the smoothness of abundance pattern , and the ratio th - u / pb - bi ) .",
    "it should also be noted that we would not insist that the neutrino - wind model explored in this study is necessarily the best ( or only ) astrophysical site for the @xmath0-process .",
    "in fact , the physical conditions in this model , namely , the rather massive proto - neutron star ( @xmath4 ) with rapid contraction of @xmath105 to be 10  km , seem difficult to be achieved according to the current hydrodynamic studies . clearly , more study is needed to seek the true @xmath0-process site .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging that the age of the cs  31082 - 001 determined in this study is in excellent agreement with the age of the universe derived by other dating techniques .",
    "we hope our results provide some fresh insights to the future modeling of the true astrophysical @xmath0-process site .",

    "<S> the discovery of the second highly @xmath0-process - enhanced , extremely metal - poor star , cs  31082 - 001 ( [ fe / h ] @xmath1 ) has provided a powerful new tool for age determination , by virtue of the detection and measurement of the radioactive species uranium and thorium . </S>",
    "<S> because the half - life of @xmath2u is one - third that of @xmath3th , the u - th pair can , in principle , provide a far more precise cosmochronometer than the th - eu pair that has been used in previous investigations . in the application of this chronometer </S>",
    "<S> , the age of ( the progenitor of ) cs  31082 - 001 can be regarded as the minimum age of the galaxy , and hence of the universe .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the serious limitations of this approach , however , is that predictions of the production ratio of u and th have not been made in the context of a realistic astrophysical model of the @xmath0-process . </S>",
    "<S> we have endeavored to produce such a model , based on the `` neutrino winds '' that are expected to arise from the nascent neutron star of a core - collapse supernova . in this model , the proto - neutron star mass and the ( asymptotic ) neutrino sphere radius </S>",
    "<S> are assumed to be @xmath4 and 10  km , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> recent hydrodynamic studies indicate that there may exist difficulties in obtaining such a compact ( massive and/or small in radius ) remnant . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , we utilize this set of parameter choices since previous work suggests that the third @xmath0-process peak ( and thus u and th ) is hardly reached when one adopts a less compact proto - neutron star in the framework of the neutrino - wind scenario . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature and density histories of the material involved in the neutron - capture processes are obtained with the assumption of a steady flow of the neutrino - powered winds , with general relativistic effects taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the electron fraction is taken to be a free parameter , constant with time . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis in these trajectories is calculated with a nuclear reaction network code including actinides up to @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> the mass - integrated @xmath0-process yields , obtained by assuming a simple time evolution of the neutrino luminosity , are compared to the available spectroscopic elemental abundance data of cs  31082 - 001 . as a result , the `` age '' of this star </S>",
    "<S> is determined to be @xmath6  gyr , in excellent agreement with lower limits on the age of the universe estimated by other dating techniques , as well as with other stellar radioactive age estimates . </S>",
    "<S> future measurements of pt and pb in this star , as well as expansion of searches for additional @xmath0-process - enhanced , metal - poor stars ( especially those in which both u and th are measurable ) , are of special importance to constrain the current astrophysical models for the @xmath0-process . </S>"
