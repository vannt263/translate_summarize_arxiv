    "the concept of gravity as a fundamental interaction has been under scrutiny ever since the seminal work of sakharov @xcite , the so called induced gravity , suggesting that the spacetime background emerges as a mean field approximation to the underlying microscopic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "some years later , the four laws of black hole thermodynamics @xcite were discovered and the entropy law was gradually extended to explain more general systems , known today as the holographic principle @xcite .",
    "the strongest evidence of the holographic principle was provided by the @xmath2 correspondence which states that all information about a gravitational system in a region of spacetime is contained in its boundary @xcite .",
    "the relation between gravity and thermodynamics was studied in @xcite where it was argued that the einstein field equations is a consequence of the relation between the horizon area , entropy and the clausius relation @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the energy flux and unruh temperature seen by an accelerated observer just inside the horizon .",
    "a number of different approaches were subsequently followed where the emphasis was on the close connection between einstein gravity and thermodynamics @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . along this line",
    ", a suggestion has been made in the recent past by verlinde @xcite to the effect that gravity can be considered as an entropic force caused by changes in the information related to the positions of material bodies .",
    "this idea implies that gravity is not a fundamental force and , somehow , has its roots laid out in the work presented in @xcite more than forty years ago .",
    "in addition , to understand the universe at its earliest moments , a quantum theory of gravity should be constructed for which all attempts have been fruitless so far .",
    "therefore the idea of an entropic force is interesting since it could be instrumental in explaining the origin of gravity and its unification with quantum theory .",
    "the spacetime can be considered as an information device built up of holographic screens or surfaces over which the the system s information can be stored .",
    "the screens or surfaces behave like stretched horizons in black hole physics .",
    "the information on such screens is described by the entropy and is encoded in terms of the number of bits which , naturally , are proportional to the area of the screen @xcite . in @xcite the author ,",
    "using the verlinde s idea describes the coulombs law in the framework of the entropic force . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors argue that the entropic formulation provides new insights into the quantum nature of the inertia and gravity .",
    "they use the entropic postulate to determine the quantum uncertainty in the law of inertia and the law of gravity in both non - relativistic and relativistic cases . as discussed in @xcite",
    "the entropic gravity can not explain observations related to the gravitationally - bound quantum states of neutrons in the granit experiment .",
    "later , a careful analysis @xcite showed that such analysis is not correct @xcite .",
    "it is a well known fact that the biggest challenge towards a theory of quantum gravity is the question of renormalizability whose lack , in effect , would imply loss of theoretical control and predictability at high energies .",
    "many attempts have been made in the past decades to address this question , but to no avail .",
    "however , a recent proposition made by horava suggests that a lifshitz type anisotropic scaling at high energies can be used to evade this difficulty @xcite .",
    "this theory , known as horava - lifshitz gravity , was motivated by a scalar field model proposed by lifshitz @xcite to explain the quantum critical phenomena in condensed matter physics where the corresponding action possesses @xmath6 scale - invariance where @xmath7 represents the dynamical critical exponent given by @xmath8 the theory thus obtained is non - relativistic in the @xmath9 limit and is hoped to be @xmath9 finite .",
    "horava has argued that it is superficially renormalizable based on power counting and may lead to einstein s general relativity in the ir region .",
    "therefore , it may be regarded as a uv complete candidate for general relativity .",
    "although the gravity action of the horava theory with the detailed balance condition recovers gr in the ir limit , its solutions may not do so .",
    "for example the authors in @xcite have studied thermodynamics of black holes in the deformed hl gravity with a dynamical coupling constant @xmath10 and showed that for @xmath11 , the black hole behaves like a reissner - norstrom black hole which is different from the schwarzschild black hole solution obtained in einstein gravity . however , in @xcite the authors studied a particular limit of the theory which admits flat minkowski vacuum and discussed the quadratic fluctuations around it .",
    "they showed that by adding a term proportional to the spatial three - curvature @xmath12 to the action , the ir modification can be recovered which allows for the flat minkowski vacuum as a solution . in this way , the spherically symmetric",
    ", asymptotically flat black hole solution is constructed in gr .",
    "we note that the ir vacuum of horava theory is an anti de sitter ( ads ) spacetime . in order to achieve a more desirable ir behavior without discarding the simplicity provided by the detailed balance condition in the uv limit , a non - trivial test of the new gravity theory in a frw universe",
    "was studied by introducing the @xmath13 @xmath12 term in the second reference in @xcite . by taking the @xmath14 limit and considering an ir modification which breaks `` softly '' the detailed balance condition in the original horava model , the ir modified horava gravity seems to become consistent with the current observational data .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is devoted to the study of qcd phase transition in the context of deformed hl gravity from the point of view of the entropic force , introduced by verlinde to study the early universe .",
    "the standard model of cosmology suggests that as the early universe expanded and cooled , it underwent a series of symmetry - breaking phase transitions , causing topological defects to form .",
    "it is the study of such phase transitions that would pave the way for a better understanding of the evolution of the early universe , characterized by the existence of a quark - gluon plasma undergoing a phase transition @xcite . during the evolution of the very early universe",
    "there have been at least two phase transitions .",
    "the electroweak theory predicts that at about @xmath15 there was a transition from a symmetric high temperature phase with massless gauge bosons to the higgs phase , where the @xmath16 gauge symmetry is spontaneously broken and all the masses in the model are generated .",
    "also , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) predicts that at about @xmath17 there was a transition from a quark - gluon plasma to a plasma of light hadrons , which is thought to have occurred early in the history of the universe .",
    "the taking place of this phase transition is dated back to a few microseconds after the big bang for which the universe had a mean density of the same order as nuclear matter @xmath18 . in what follows",
    "we focus attention on possible scenarios which might have occurred to allow such a phase transition to come to the fore .",
    "we generally follow the discussion presented in @xcite and @xcite which puts the quark - gluon phase transition in a cosmologically transparent perspective .",
    "the study of a phase transition in the early universe requires a knowledge of the equation of state ( eos ) which plays an essential role in the hot , strongly interacting matter and in the hydrodynamic description of heavy ion collisions @xcite . generally , for a description of the collective flow in heavy ion collisions , model theories",
    "have been constructed with an eos representing a first order phase transition . however , lattice qcd calculations suggest that the transition to the de - confined phase is that of a crossover .",
    "the eos is not only of theoretical interest , but is directly applicable to the dynamics of the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) , whether in the context of interpreting the results of heavy - ion experiments or modeling the behavior of hot , dense matter in the early universe @xcite.the possibility of a phase transition in the gas of a quark - gluon bag was demonstrated for the first time in @xcite .",
    "the mechanism responsible for a first - order phase transition has been elegantly discussed in @xcite .",
    "attempts to calculate the eos on the lattice have been made over the last @xmath19 years @xcite . as is well known ,",
    "calculating the equation of state of qcd is one of the central goals of lattice simulations at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "lattice qcd is a fundamental tool which makes a systematic study of the non - perturbative regime of the qcd equation of state possible . for a comparison of lattice calculations of the eos with continuum perturbation theory or models like the mit bag eos ,",
    "it is necessary to remove the lattice artifacts .",
    "this approach using supercomputers @xcite has led to the calculation of the qcd equation of state with two light quarks with a heavier strange quark on a @xmath20 size lattice @xcite .",
    "in this section , we study the friedmann equation in deformed hl gravity in the framework of the entropic force .",
    "let us start with a ( 3 + 1)-dimensional frw universe which is described by the metric @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 denotes the spatial curvature constant with @xmath23 corresponding to a closed , flat and open universe , respectively with @xmath24 representing the two - sphere .",
    "introducing @xmath25 , the metric ( [ e2 - 1 ] ) becomes @xmath26 with @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "a marginally trapped surface with vanishing expansion for a dynamical apparent horizon is determined by the relation @xmath30 , implying that the vector @xmath31 is null or degenerate on the apparent horizon surface @xcite .",
    "it is now a matter of a simple calculation to show that the dynamical apparent horizon , @xmath32 , is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the hubble parameter and @xmath35 is the speed of light . now , suppose that the energy - momentum tensor @xmath36 of the matter in the universe has the form of a perfect fluid @xmath37 , with @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the energy density , isotropic pressure and four - velocity of the cosmological fluid , respectively .",
    "the matter conservation law , @xmath42 , leads to @xmath43    in an interesting work @xcite it has been shown that the friedmann equation can be derived from the first law of thermodynamics , see @xcite for further details .",
    "it is thus of interest to obtain the modified friedmann equation in deformed hl gravity in the context of the entropic force .",
    "to begin we note that the temperature associated with apparent horizon can be defined as @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the surface gravity given by @xmath46 .",
    "it can subsequently be shown that the temperature of the apparent horizon can be written as @xcite @xmath47 one of the quantum corrections applied to the horizon area law of a black hole is the logarithmic correction that arises from loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) due to thermal equilibrium fluctuations and quantum fluctuations . as a result",
    ", the entropy is written as @xcite @xmath48 where the geometric parameter @xmath49 is a dimensionless constant of order unity whose exact value is still a puzzle in lqg .",
    "it is clear that if @xmath50 , then the entropy expression reduces to schwarzschild s entropy , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the planck length .",
    "the geometric parameter @xmath49 has a direct relation to gravity and therefore by applying the logarithmic corrections to the entropy of black holes in the deformed hl gravity one has @xcite",
    "@xmath53 one notes that in hl theories @xmath49 is proportional to @xmath54 where @xmath1 is a dimensionless constant parameter of the theory .",
    "one also notes that for @xmath55 we discover the entropy as obtained in einstein gravity .",
    "verlinde @xcite made an interesting suggestion that gravity may be regarded as an entropic force caused by changes in the information associated with the positions of material bodies .",
    "such a strong assumption together with the holographic principle and the equipartition law of energy , enabled verlinde to obtain the second law of newtonian mechanics and the newtonian law of gravitation .",
    "verlinde postulated that when a test particle with @xmath56 approaches a holographic screen from a distance @xmath57 , the change of entropy on the holographic screen is @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the compton wavelength .",
    "thus , the compton wavelength defines the units of the entropy change . from this relation",
    "we realize that when a test particle which has mass @xmath60 and is located at the distance @xmath57 from the holographic surface moves to the immediate vicinity of the surface , it causes a change of entropy @xmath61 of the holographic screen . in effect , this means that the particle is embedded into the surface and becomes part of the information and energy on the screen .",
    "according to verlinde s argument , gravity arises from the entropic gradient @xmath62 over the spatial region @xmath63 via the first law of thermodynamics @xmath64 where @xmath5 is the temperature of the screen and @xmath65 is the so - called entropic force .",
    "originally , the starting point of verlinde s derivation was an assumption that the holographic screen forms a sphere with radius @xmath66 .",
    "it is also known that a sphere with area @xmath67 acts as a storage device for information , that is @xmath68 verlinde then argued that the energy @xmath69 of a system is the rest energy @xmath70 of the mass inside the sphere and that the energy is divided evenly over the bits , @xmath71 @xmath72 it is now seen that if we insert the relation @xmath70 in equation ( [ e2 - 18 ] ) with thermodynamical equilibrium in mind , that is , @xmath73 and use the unruh effect @xcite given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the proper acceleration of the observer and also use the fact that the area of a two - sphere with radius @xmath66 is @xmath76 , we find @xmath77 which is newton s universal law of gravitation .",
    "a very similar derivation of equation ( [ e2 - 19 ] ) was also discovered by padmanabhan @xcite .",
    "using the entropy of a black hole which is a quarter of the area of the event horizon @xcite , one may write @xmath78 plugging equation([e2 - 10 ] ) in equation([e2 - 20 ] ) , we obtain the total number of bits for the hl gravity in the form @xmath79    the friedmann equation may also be reproduced from this entropic force method . in the context of the entropic force , the energy @xmath69 for a thermodynamic system is defined by the number of bits on the holographic screen by the equipartition law @xmath80 with @xmath5 the temperature of the holographic screen . here",
    ", we choose the apparent horizon to be the holographic screen .",
    "so the temperature @xmath5 is that of the apparent horizon .",
    "therefore @xmath81 from the equipartition law becomes @xmath82 also , the amount of energy crossing the apparent horizon during the time interval @xmath83 is defined as @xcite @xmath84 from equations([e2 - 22 ] ) and ( [ e2 - 15 ] ) , we have @xmath85d\\tilde{r}_{a } = 16\\pi^{2}c g\\omega\\tilde{r}_{a}^{5}(\\rho+p)hdt.\\ ] ] after some algebra we find @xmath86+\\left(h^{2}+\\frac{k}{a^{2}}\\right)=\\frac{8\\pi\\rho}{3}.\\ ] ] equation ( [ e2 - 26 ] ) is the modified friedmann equation from the entropic force which is more complicated compared to the standard friedmann equation .",
    "the above equation can rewritten in a more manageable form , see the second reference in @xcite @xmath87 as expected , setting @xmath55 , we see that the first term in equation([e2 - 26 ] ) vanishes and the standard friedmann equation is recovered . here",
    "@xmath39 is the total energy density , @xmath22 is the spatial curvature of the universe , @xmath34 is the hubble parameter and @xmath75 is the scale factor .",
    "equation([e2 - 27 ] ) is a second degree equation in @xmath88 with a solution @xmath89 where we have set @xmath90 . from equation([e2 - 28 ] ) one notes that according to the entropic interpretation of the force of gravity , the term @xmath91 is proportional to @xmath92 .",
    "when the hubble radius was around @xmath93 and the universe was about @xmath94 old , the last phase transition predicted by the standard model of particle physics took place at the qcd scale @xmath95 mev . in order to study the quark - hadron phase transition in the deformed horava - lifshitz gravity theory we need the equation of state of the matter , in both quark and hadron states .",
    "we shall use the simplest possible form of an eos with a first order phase transition , that of a bag eos .",
    "the smallness of baryon entropy ratio in the early universe allows us to restrict ourselves to the case where the chemical potential is very small , @xmath96 which means that we can determine the eos by ignoring the effects of chemical potential @xcite .",
    "let us start from the equation of state of matter in the quark phase @xmath97 where @xmath98 with @xmath99 and @xmath100 is the intrinsic statistical weights for the quark - gloun plasma and @xmath101 are the statistical weights of bosons and fermions , respectively . at the epoch of the quark - hadron phase transition photons @xmath102 , electrons @xmath103 , muons@xmath103 and neutrinos @xmath104 yield @xmath105 .",
    "here @xmath106 is the number of relativistic quark flavors , two at lower temperature corresponding to the u , d quarks and three at higher temperatures where the strange quark becomes relativistic .",
    "one may then write @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "the self - interaction potential @xmath109 is defined as @xcite @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the qcd vacuum energy or bag pressure constant .",
    "results obtained in low energy hadron spectroscopy , heavy ion collisions and phenomenological fits of light hadron properties give @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 @xcite with @xmath115 being the mass of the strange quark , considered in the range @xmath116 ) . in the case where the temperature effects are negligible",
    ", the equation of state in the quark phase takes the form of the mit bag model equation of state , @xmath117 in the hadron phase and we take the cosmological fluid with energy density @xmath118 and pressure @xmath119 as an ideal gas of massless pions and nucleons obeying maxwell - boltzmann statistics .",
    "the equation of state can now be approximated by @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "taking @xmath123 as the intrinsic statistical weights for the soup of hadrons , we have @xmath124 . during quark - hadron phase transition the temperature is equal to the critical temperature @xmath125 which is defined by the condition @xmath126 , and is given by @xcite @xmath127 if we take @xmath128 and @xmath129 , the transition temperature is of the order @xmath130 .",
    "one should note that since the phase transition is assumed to be of first order , all the physical quantities like energy density , pressure and entropy exhibit discontinuities across the critical curve .",
    "ignoring temperature effects in @xmath109 and taking @xmath131 in the above equation we obtain the well known relation between @xmath125 and @xmath111 , that is @xmath132 @xcite .",
    "now , two thermodynamic quantities are of importance in the study of the early universe .",
    "the first is the enthalpy defined as @xmath133 where @xmath134 is the total energy flow through the apparent horizon which leads to @xmath135 , from which the heat capacity of the universe enveloped by the apparent horizon at constant pressure can be obtained @xmath136 the other thermodynamic quantity is the entropy , defined as @xmath137 ( chemical potential is zero ) . since in the expanding universe the change of the horizon radius is positive and that of the horizon temperature is negative we have @xmath138 thereupon @xmath139 which points to the fact that the system ( universe ) is losing energy in the form of heat .",
    "let us now study the phase transition described above . to this end",

    "the hrg model gives a decent description of thermodynamic quantities in the transition region .",
    "the hrg result for the trace anomaly can also be parameterized by the simple form @xmath214 where @xmath215 and @xmath216 . inserting this equation in equation ( [ e5 - 1 ] ) for the low temperature",
    ", the pressure and energy density can be found @xmath217 @xmath218 with @xmath219 in a similar fashion , substitution of the eos equation ( [ e5 - 8 ] ) and ( [ e5 - 9 ] ) in equation ( [ e4 - 2 ] ) yields the basic equation describing the change of temperature in the high temperature region @xmath220^{1/2},\\hspace{6cm}\\ ] ] where @xmath213 above refers to equation ( [ e5 - 9 ] ) .",
    "figure ( [ fig.8 ] ) shows such a variation of temperature in the low temperature region .",
    "in addition , we have compared the effective temperature of the first order phase transition with that of the cross - over , which is shown in figures ( [ fig.9 ] ) and ( [ fig.10 ] ) . as can be seen ,",
    "the effective temperature of the lattice data which correspond to a cross - over phase transition is higher than the effective temperature of a first order phase transition .",
    "in this work , we have discussed the quark - hadron phase transition in the context of a deformed horava - lifshitz gravity scenario within an effective model of quantum chromodynamics . by using the friedmann equations based on entropic interpretation of gravity proposed by verlinde",
    ", we studied the evolution of the physical quantities relevant to the physical description of the early universe ; the energy density and temperature , before , during , and after the phase transition .",
    "we find that for different values of @xmath1 , phase transition occurs and the results show that increasing this parameter decreases the effective temperature of the quark - gluon plasma and of the hadronic fluid , and also increases the hadronic fraction in the mixed phase . in the last section we have considered the quark - hadron transition in the context of a smooth crossover regime at high @xmath221 and low @xmath222 temperatures . for both regions",
    ", we used the equation of state obtained by the hot `` qcd '' collaboration .",
    "the results which are based on lattice data for a parametrization of high temperature region and a parametrization for low temperature region represent the same effect on the variation of temperature similar to the quark - gluon plasma and hadronic phases . the generic behavior of the temperature of the early universe in such a scenario is similar to that of a first order phase transition , although the differences in the energy should be taken into account . as mentioned above , the effective temperature of a first order phase transition is lower than that of a cross - over since the temperature falls off faster in a first order phase transition .",
    "therefore , hadronization takes place more rapidly in a universe undergoing a first order phase transition .",
