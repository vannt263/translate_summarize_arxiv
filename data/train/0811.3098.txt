    "the light variations of pulsating variable stars contain much useful information both on the physics of the brightness changes and also on the global parameters of the objects .",
    "concerning rr  lyrae stars , this information can be retrieved using e.g. , different variants of the baade - wesselink ( ) analysis @xcite or empirical relations between the fourier parameters of the light curves and certain physical parameters of the variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , there are cases , for example , blazhko rr  lyrae stars showing light curve variation when we are encountering problems with both methods .",
    "the empirical light curve  physical parameter relations are proved to be valid only for rr  lyrae stars with reasonably stable light curves i.e. , for unmodulated or weakly modulated stars . a good example for the latter is rr  gem , which is one of the calibrator objects of these relations , while its light curve is weakly but unambiguously modulated @xcite . in spite of its small amplitude light - curve modulation , rr gem fits well all the empirical light curve  physical parameter relations .",
    "the fourier parameters of the mean pulsation light curve of a large modulation amplitude blazhko star , however , differ significantly from the parameters calculated for the light curves at any phase of the modulation ( see e.g. mw  lyr , @xcite ) , which makes the inference of the empirical relations ambiguous for these blazhko variables . applying the empirical formulae on the fourier parameters of mw lyr in different phases of the modulation ( data from table 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) variations of 0.45 dex in [ fe / h ] are obtained during the blazhko cycle .",
    "it would be difficult to find a physical explanation for such a metallicity variation .",
    "moreover , the magnitude averaged absolute brightness changes calculated from the fourier parameters are 0.025 mag larger than what is in fact directly observed .",
    "therefore , at present the light curve - physical parameter formulae are not appropriate to follow the changes in the mean physical parameters during the blazhko cycle .",
    "the analysis is capable for determining physical parameters of blazhko stars for any phase of the modulation if simultaneous @xmath3 and multicolour photometric observations were available .",
    "thus , any changes in the mean physical parameters could be , in principle , detected .",
    "however , a practical problem is that for obtaining such results simultaneous extended spectroscopic radial velocity and multicolour photometric observations were needed with good phase coverage of both the pulsation and the modulation cycles .",
    "for such an investigation at least one order of magnitude more @xmath3 data points were needed than are available today .    up to now , there are only about two dozens of unmodulated field rrab stars , about one dozen rrab stars in globular clusters , and no blazhko variable which have simultaneous photometric and @xmath3 observations suitable for analysis . on the contrary ,",
    "extended and accurate multicolour observations of many modulated and unmodulated rrab stars have become available from our ccd observations at the konkoly observatory in the past several years @xcite . to extract physical information exclusively from multicolour light curves of rrab stars",
    "we have developed a method that fits the observed magnitudes and colours with appropriate physical parameters and their variations .",
    "the main advantage of the method is that all these are derived exclusively from photometric observations without any need of spectroscopic measurements .    in this paper",
    "our method is introduced and is tested on 9 non - modulated rrab stars .",
    "the application of the method on a large modulation amplitude rr  lyrae star , mw  lyr @xcite , is presented in @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of the inverse photometric baade - wesselink method ( ip method ) is to look for the pulsational velocity ( @xmath4 ) and effective temperature ( @xmath5 ) curves ( @xmath6 denotes the pulsation phase ) , the distance , and the mean radius of the star which best reproduce the input light curves utilising static atmosphere model results .",
    "the inputs of the method are the fourier series fitted to the multicolour @xmath7 light curves and the metallicity ( [ fe / h ] ) .",
    "the input fourier curves may represent either the light curves of an unmodulated rrab star , the mean pulsation light curves of a modulated star , or the light curves of a modulated rr lyrae star at a certain blazhko phase . to obtain correct results the extinction corrected apparent visual brightness and the intrinsic colours have to be known .",
    "however , as it is shown in sect .",
    "[ sect : app - zp ] the latter requirement is not always crucial , since the colour zero points can be determined by the method itself if good quality light curves are available .    for using model atmosphere",
    "tables the value of [ fe / h ] and the instantaneous values of @xmath5 and the effective gravity ( @xmath8 ) are needed .",
    "the latter is determined from the @xmath4 curve , the mass ( @xmath9 ) , and the average radius ( @xmath10 ) of the star , as follows .",
    "the instantaneous radius ( @xmath11 ) and the radial acceleration ( @xmath12 ) are computed from @xmath4 as the first integral and the first derivative , respectively . knowing these variables , @xmath13 are then calculated according to the formula :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the mass satisfies the modified form of the pulsation equation :    @xmath16    which has been derived from eq .",
    "1a of @xcite by substituting the mean logarithm of the luminosity , @xmath17 with :    @xmath18    note that @xmath9 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are in solar units and ` 0 ' index denotes pulsation - cycle - averaged values .",
    "@xmath21 is the pulsation period of the variable in days .",
    "synthetic colours , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and bolometric correction , @xmath24 , corresponding to [ fe / h ] , @xmath5 and @xmath8 are taken from the static atmosphere model tables of @xcite .",
    "we applied linear interpolation in [ fe / h ] to obtain a resolution of 0.05dex between the 0.5dex steps of the original tables .",
    "the original resolution of the @xmath0 and @xmath25 grid are 250k and 0.5dex , respectively , which have been interpolated by spline functions .",
    "the extinction corrected apparent magnitudes of the star is then derived from : @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the distance in pc .    an implementation of the levenberg - marquardt nonlinear fitting algorithm by @xcite is applied to fit the derived light and colour curves to the observations with the alterations of the initial @xmath5 and @xmath4 curves , @xmath27 , and @xmath10 . to obtain physically plausible results continuity , smoothness , and periodicity of the variations of the physical parameters have to be maintained during the fitting process . in order to attain these ,",
    "the initial @xmath5 and @xmath4 functions are defined as smooth and continuous funcions which are then modified by the fitting algorithm with the addition of appropriate order fourier series .",
    "rr lyr atmospheres differ from static atmospheres in many respects .",
    "just to mention some of the most problematic issues , in the dynamic atmosphere of large amplitude pulsating variables shock waves propagate , local thermodynamic equilibrium does not fulfil ( nlte ) , the atmosphere is not thin compared to the radius of the star while plan - parallel models are calculated , the turbulent velocity ( @xmath28 ) also varies during the pulsation cycle , etc .",
    "however , as atmosphere models taking into account all these complications ( or at least some of them ) have not been calculated yet for a wide enough range of parameters , all the methods which are applied today to define the physical parameters of pulsating variables from photometric and spectroscopic data relies on static atmosphere models to some extent .",
    "the applicability of static atmosphere models for dynamic atmospheres of pulsating rr  lyrae stars has already been discussed by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been shown that the vicinity of the minimum radius phase is that part of the light curve where the validity of static models is the most questionable .",
    "notwithstanding , in the ip method the whole phase range of the pulsation is used in order to maintain the continuity of the curves .",
    "the smoothness and continuity of the curves are especially important because , due to the dynamic nature of the atmosphere , and to possible differences of the temperature scales the different colours corresponding the input light curves are sometimes out of the ranges of the static atmosphere grid e.g. , on the plane which would otherwise introduce discontinuity in the output curves .",
    "since we do not use the input colour and magnitude values at any phase directly for calculating physical quantities , problems that arise from inappropriateness of the static atmosphere models at certain phases does not affect our results directly .",
    "our inverse method ensures that the solution curves are completely within the ranges of the model grid . where the static model is less appropriate a poorer fit is expected .",
    "the @xmath29 colour is a good temperature indicator both theoretically and empirically .",
    "we use the polynomial transformation given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 8 . ) to calculate an initial @xmath5 function from the input @xmath23 curve .",
    "the actual accuracy of this formula is not an issue because a number of test runs show that the fitting process converges to the same solution @xmath5 curve when started from a wide range of initial functions i.e. , the results are not sensitive to its choice .",
    "the solution @xmath5 curve depends slightly on the choice of the initial @xmath4 function , but its effect is less than @xmath30k in any phase of the pulsation .",
    "in contrast with the stability of the @xmath5 function , the situation with the pulsational velocity , @xmath4 , is quite different .",
    "we have found that , during the fitting process , the @xmath4 curve departs from a physically plausible shape if the fitting method is allowed to change its shape arbitrarily .",
    "therefore , it is essential to find a reasonably good initial @xmath4 curve and , to get a reliable result , the solution @xmath4 curve has to be kept near to the initial one .",
    "@xcite published a template @xmath4 curve of rrab stars based on about a dozen observed @xmath31 curves .",
    "the amplitudes of the input curves were normalized to unity and they were phased to coincide at their minima .",
    "the average of these curves was then calculated to define the shape of a template @xmath4 curve .",
    "@xcite also derived a relation which gave the amplitude of the @xmath4 curve as a function of the @xmath32 light curve amplitude with an accuracy of about 5km / s .",
    "the actual template @xmath4 curve of an rrab variable is defined by the template shape and this amplitude formula .",
    "this template @xmath4 curve describes the input curves with about 5km / s accuracy , except on the steep descending branch between phases 0.85 and 1.0 , where the accuracy is only about 25km / s .",
    "this average curve has , however , several drawbacks . due to phase differences on the very steep descending branch ,",
    "the template curve is less steep here as any of the individual curves ( see fig .  2 in * ?",
    "for similar reason , the minimum is less sharp than most of the individual @xmath4 curves .",
    "another problem with the template @xmath4 curve of @xcite is its fixed shape .",
    "our main purpose in developing the ip method was to study blazhko stars showing large amplitude light curve modulation .",
    "looking at the large variety of the light curves shape of a blazhko variable during the blazhko cycle , it definitely does not seem to be a good decision to fix the shape of the @xmath4 curve to a unique template .",
    "therefore , we have been looking for some connection between the @xmath4 curve , and the colour and light curves .      the only @xmath3 observation that covers both the pulsation and modulation cycles of a blazhko star",
    "was obtained by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , there is no simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observation of any blazhko star that would permit to examine the possibility of a light curve ",
    "@xmath1 curve connection valid for blazhko stars in the course of the modulation .",
    "therefore , in the following we consider only unmodulated rrab stars .",
    "we used the photometric and @xmath3 data of rrab stars collected by @xcite . from kovcs s sample of 22 rr  lyrae stars 20 are utilised , as rr  leo and w  crt has been omitted because of their discrepant curves . additionally , we also used data of rv  oct .",
    "this sample contains all the rr  lyrae stars that have accurate @xmath3 and photometric observations with good phase coverage of the pulsation .",
    "following @xcite we use @xmath34 projection factor to transform radial velocities to pulsational velocities according to the formula :    @xmath35    inspecting the observed @xmath31 and light and colour curves , we have found that the shape of the @xmath33 curve resembles the most to that of the @xmath31 curve . the @xmath36 vs.   @xmath37 values of the 21 rrab stars",
    "are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - vrad ] .",
    "asterisk denotes that their phase - averaged value is subtracted from the data i.e. , they are shifted to the same @xmath1 and magnitude zero points .",
    "this plot shows that the @xmath38 of an rrab star can be expressed as a function of its @xmath39 brightness at any phase of the pulsation with sufficient accuracy .",
    "statistical tests were performed to determine on how many parameters @xmath36 depends significantly and whether it is sufficient to express it with @xmath40 terms or it also depends on the colours .",
    "the @xmath41 of different degree regressions of @xmath36 with terms of @xmath40 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - vrad - reg ] .",
    "the plot reveals that no significant improvement can be achieved when we take into account a colour or compound term , too .",
    "it can also be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : i - vrad - reg ] that a 3rd order polynomial fit with @xmath37 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 terms describes @xmath36 with sufficient accuracy .",
    "however , if we fit the data directly by this polynomial , it will not be monotonic at the ends of the @xmath37 range covered by the data . therefore , to obtain a strictly monotonic relation ,",
    "the following steps were performed .",
    "the plotted data were smoothed with a cubic spline and the spline was extrapolated linearly over the boundaries of the covered @xmath37 range with about 0.05mag at both ends .",
    "this spline was then fitted with a 7th degree polynomial . finally , we found the following relation between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , which represents the @xmath38 curve of rrab stars similarly good or even better than liu s template does .",
    "the formula :    @xmath48    where @xmath49    @xmath50    fits the observations of the 21 stars with 3.51km / s accuracy .",
    "the errors of the coefficients are :    @xmath51     vs.  @xmath39 relation .",
    "the plotted values are calculated from the fourier fits of the light and radial velocity curves of 21 stars sampled with 1/500 phase resolution .",
    "asterisks denote that the time averages are subtracted from the data .",
    "the solid grey ( cyan ) line shows a 7th order polynomial fit according to eq .",
    "[ eq : i - vrad].[fig : i - vrad ] , width=302 ]     values of the regressions of @xmath36 with @xmath40 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 terms .",
    "filled circles denote the @xmath52th degree regressions when only @xmath40 terms are used .",
    "open circles denote regressions where @xmath53 terms of @xmath40 and one colour or compound term are taken into account .",
    "the @xmath41 does not drop significantly after the 3rd degree .",
    "the best 3rd order solution is achieved by a regression using the @xmath37 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 terms .",
    "the arrow at the top left corner shows that data points here are at high @xmath41 values , between 9km / s and 20km / s.[fig : i - vrad - reg],width=226 ]    when running the ip code , initial @xmath4 curves derived either from liu s template or from the relation are applied .",
    "as we are not sure that any of these @xmath4 curves are correct indeed , the shapes of the solution @xmath4 curves are not fixed to these templates .",
    "unfortunately , as we mentioned earlier the @xmath4 curve converges to a physically irrealistic solution if it is allowed to change arbitrarily .",
    "therefore the fitting algorithm treats the initial @xmath4 template as another curve that is fitted with an actual , varied @xmath4 curve . in this way , it becomes possible to give penalties to the trials depending on how much their @xmath4 curve deviates from the initial one .",
    "the rate of this penalty can be altered by a weight factor .",
    "two weight factors are used .",
    "one allows @xmath4 to depart from the initial curve with about @xmath54km / s or less in any phase of the pulsation ( medium weight ) .",
    "the other weight is 100 times larger , allowing practically no change in @xmath4 ( large weight ) .",
    "the variation of the initial @xmath4 curve is allowed with the addition of a 2nd order fourier series , as our experiments show that higher orders lead to wavy solution curves",
    ". however , the results of the ip method depend more significantly on the quality of the input light curves than on the choice and variance of the initial @xmath4 curves .",
    "the @xmath55km / s accuracy of the initial @xmath4 curves makes it possible to achieve similarly accurate results with the ip method using exculsively good quality photometric data as with earlier direct analyses .    as our method fits the output mathematical curves to input mathematical curves ,",
    "the formal errors of the derived parameters according to the levenberg - marquardt fitting algorithm are meaningless and are independent from the uncertainties of the underlying observations . however , the results of the ip method are very sensitive to the accuracy and phase coverage of the photometric observations , since for good quality data the results depend only slightly on the internal settings of the code ( @xmath3 template , weight factor ) while for worse data quality the results can show relatively large dispersion .",
    "another problem of estimating the errors of the parameters derived from the ip method is that accurate fits of the input data can also be obtained for physically unreliable conditions , e.g , when the mass is not fixed by the pulsation equation , or when fitting the initial radial velocity curve has only a small weight .",
    "therefore we regard the range of the output values from four different runs with different settings listed in table 1 as an estimate of the inherent uncertainty of the ip method .",
    ".applied settings of the ip method.[tbl : abcd ] [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",

    "the ip method has been specialised to fundamental mode rr  lyrae stars , although with the appropriate choice of the initial @xmath4 curve and using adequate pulsation equation it could be adapted for other type of radial pulsators . using appropriate model atmosphere tables ,",
    "the method is applicable for other passbands , as well .",
    "to do this , however , empirical formulae between the appropriate colours and brightnesses , and the @xmath4 and @xmath5 curves have to be defined first .",
    "we thank to an anonymous referee for his / her very helpful comments and suggestions from which our paper benefited a lot .",
    "we are grateful to gza kovcs for helpful discussions and for the photometric and @xmath3 data he kindly provided us in electronic form .",
    "we thank jnos nuspl for the useful discussions on atmosphere models and istvn dkny for his help at the beginning of this work .",

    "<S> we present a new method for determining physical parameters of rrab variables exclusively from multicolour light curves . </S>",
    "<S> our method is an inverse photometric baade - wesselink analysis which , using a nonlinear least squares algorithm , searches for the effective temperature ( @xmath0 ) and pulsational velocity ( @xmath1 ) curves and other physical parameters that best fit the observed light curves , utilising synthetic colours and bolometric corrections from static atmosphere models . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 and @xmath1 curves are initially derived from empirical relations then they are varied by the fitting algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the method yields the variations and the absolute values of the radius , the effective temperature , the visual brightness , and the luminosity of individual objects . </S>",
    "<S> distance and mass are also determined . </S>",
    "<S> the method is tested on 9 rrab stars subjected to baade - wesselink analyses earlier by several authors . </S>",
    "<S> the physical parameters derived by our method using only the light curve data of these stars are well within their possible ranges defined by direct baade - wesselink and other techniques </S>",
    "<S> . a new empirical relation between the @xmath2 magnitude and the pulsational velocity is also presented , which allows to construct the @xmath1 curve of an rrab star purely from photometric observations to an accuracy of about 3.5km / s .    </S>",
