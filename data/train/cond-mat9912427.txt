    "the effect of a bosonic environment on a tunneling particle has been extensively studied .",
    "the work of caldeira and leggett @xcite , which originally studied the tunneling of a particle from a metastable state , focused attention on this problem .",
    "today there are many separate fields devoted to related questions . as an example the case of coupling of a tunneling particle to a photonic environment is the basis of three such fields : that of dynamic image potential @xcite , coulomb blockade @xcite and dissipative macroscopic quantum tunneling ( mqt ) of josephson phase @xcite . the development of experimental techniques through which different effects now become within the scope of experimental verification @xcite is a source of enhanced interest in such problems .",
    "the coupling of a tunneling electron to phonons has received much less attention @xcite , though this problem is of fundamental interest , being closely related to the polaron problem @xcite , as well as being of potentially great technological importance . in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that in the one - dimensional case , i.e. , a quantum wire or narrow constriction , the coupling to the zero - point fluctuations of the acoustic phonon field leads to an exponential enhancement of the tunneling probability .",
    "the question of what happens to this enhancement in the the two - dimensional case in which the electron s wave function is restricted in one of the the directions perpendicular to the tunneling direction , and the three - dimensional case where the electron is free to move in both the perpendicular directions , is the subject of this paper .",
    "we address the problem of an electron tunneling coupled to acoustic phonons via two realistic coupling mechanisms : deformation potential and piezoelectric . for both coupling mechanisms we calculated the change of the tunneling probability and the renormalization of the potential barrier height . in two and three dimensions",
    "the change of tunneling probability is smaller than in one dimensional case and for its calculation we developed a perturbation theory employing the green function method .",
    "the problem of calculation of the phonon correction , however , appeared to be nontrivial for the piezoelectric coupling , where the summation of high order terms of the perturbation theory is necessary .",
    "being interested in the effect of zero - point fluctuations of the phonon field on the tunneling electron we did not consider the coupling to optical phonons .",
    "the virtual process of phonon emission and absorption is inversely proportional to the energy difference involved in that process .",
    "since emission and absorption of optical phonons involves a large energy difference the interaction with optical phonons can be neglected .    to calculate the transmission coefficient we make use of an approximation based on the slowness of the phonon field compared to the tunneling electron , which we refer to as the static approximation @xcite , and obtain a stationary schrdinger equation for the electron coupled to phonons .",
    "we then apply the parabolic ( paraxial ) approximation which is equivalent to considering the following physical situation ( which is typical experimentally ) ( i ) the barrier is so high that the tunneling can be considered semi - classically and ( ii ) the interaction energy between electrons and phonons is small compared to the height of the barrier . treating the phonons via a green function method the self - energy term",
    "is then calculated using second order perturbation theory .",
    "the resulting self - energy term is divergent at large transferred momenta , for both coupling mechanisms , and these divergences are eliminated by a renormalization procedure . for the deformation potential one has to renormalize the potential barrier height and the electron s effective mass , this finally leads to a correction to the transition probability . on the other hand for the piezoelectric coupling , after the renormalization of the potential barrier height the second order correction diverges logarithmically .",
    "the summation of main logarithmic terms resulted in a factor non - trivially depending on the electron - phonon coupling constant and can lead to a significantly change the transmission coefficient .",
    "the paper is composed in the following way . in sec.[sec : form ] we formulate the problem , introduce the model , and present the static approximation which helps us facilitate the calculations .",
    "in sec.[sec : green ] the green function method through which we approach the problem is described , the parabolic approximation is introduced , self - energy diagrams are presented and it is shown how one uses them to derive the transition probability . in sec.[sec : deformation ] the renormalized self - energies for the two and three - dimensional tunneling configurations are given for the deformation potential coupling and the renormalization equations are presented .",
    "the resulting change in the transmission coefficient is calculated . in sec.[sec : piezoelectric ] the method for including vertex corrections for the piezoelectric case is given and the resulting change in the transmission coefficient is calculated .",
    "the calculation of some complicated integrals is given in appendices .",
    "we treat the problem of an electron coupled to acoustic phonons while tunneling through a rectangular barrier , of width l. we will treat two cases that of a two and three - dimensional tunneling configurations . in the three - dimensional , case",
    "the electron is free to move in the perpendicular ( to the tunneling ) directions , whereas in the two - dimensional case the electron s movement is restricted in one of the perpendicular directions i.e a two dimensional electron gas . in both cases",
    "phonons move freely through the bulk and thus are treated as three - dimensional .",
    "being interested in the effect of the zero - point fluctuations of the phonon field on the electron tunneling probability we consider the system at zero temperature .",
    "in the general case of a tunneling particle coupled to the environment two typical time scales arise : the traverse time for the tunneling particle and the typical time in which the environment reacts to the tunneling of the particle .",
    "when the tunneling particle is an electron and the environment acoustical phonons , it can be shown that typically the traverse time for the electron is much smaller than the environmental reaction time scale .",
    "the small parameter expressing the small ratio between these time - scales is : @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the phonon sound velocity , and @xmath2 is the under the barrier electron semi - classical velocity.@xcite for a potential barrier of around 10 mev in bulk gaas , this ratio is of the order of 0.01 .",
    "this small ratio leads us to what we refer to as the static approximation . in this approximation",
    "the phonon dynamics is neglected and the potential created by the barrier has a phonon addition that may have different time independent shapes with the probability equal the wave function squared of the phonon field . [ for a more detailed description of the static approximation one is referred to the previous paper @xcite .",
    "] as a result the electron wave function underneath the barrier satisfies the following stationary schrdinger equation for the electron coupled to phonons    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the electron coordinate , @xmath5 is the electrons effective mass , @xmath6 is the potential barrier height , @xmath7 are the fourier coefficients of the lattice displacement vector @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 is a random variable whose probability is controlled by the ground state phonon wave function .",
    "for the two - dimensional case the laplacian is the two - dimensional laplacian operator .",
    "@xmath10 is the interaction term between the electron and phonons defined in the following way .",
    "for the three - dimensional case , in which the electron wave function is not restricted in the perpendicular to tunneling direction which is taken as @xmath11 , the deformation potential coupling interaction term is given by    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the deformation potential constant and @xmath14 is the normalization volume . for the piezoelectric coupling the interaction term in the hamiltonian",
    "is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the electron charge , @xmath18 is the dielectric constant , @xmath19 is the piezoelectric modules and @xmath20 denotes the average over angles . though the piezoelectric interaction is anisotropic the isotropic hamiltonian approximation",
    "is commonly used @xcite .",
    "subscripts @xmath21 and @xmath22 shall be used throughout this paper , unless otherwise stated to define deformation potential and piezoelectric related terms respectively .    for two dimensional electron gas",

    "here @xmath26 is the matrix element of the phonon exponent , @xmath27 between the wave functions describing the electron quantization in the @xmath23 direction .",
    "we neglect screening of the electron - phonon interaction , since underneath the potential barrier there are no free electrons and screening by remote electrons is small .",
    "although the static approximation resembles the electron tunneling in the presence of static disorder there is a very important difference between the two problems . whereas a static random field can absorb any momentum from the electron the momentum , absorption in the static approximation is related to phonon emission .",
    "since under the static approximation it is assumed that the phonon configuration does not change the tunneling electron momentum is conserved .",
    "the commonly used approach for addressing the problem of a tunneling particle coupled to the environment is based on the path - integral approach . the path - integral approach to the problem",
    "is extremely convenient in the one - dimensional case where the contribution to the transition probability is essentially from one trajectory . in two and three dimensional cases many different trajectories",
    "contribute to the transition probability and we prefer to use green function method .",
    "the application of this method is facilitated by the fact that a reasonable potential barrier ( e.g. , 10 mev ) it is much larger than electron - phonon interaction , so for the calculation of electron green function we can use perturbation theory . in some points the green function method that we use differs from commonly used formalism and we present it s derivation .",
    "we consider the case when the coupling between the electron and the acoustic phonons is small compared to the effective potential barrier height @xmath28 , which is considered as large .",
    "more than this , we assume that @xmath29 is the smallest length scale in the problem .",
    "it is much smaller than the width of the barrier @xmath30 and in two - dimensional case it is much smaller than the size of the quantization in @xmath23 direction , @xmath21 .",
    "the first of these conditions enables us to use the parabolic ( paraxial ) approximation @xcite , and is the basis for our perturbative method .    under the parabolic approximation we search for a solution to the schrdinger equation ( [ eq : a1 ] ) of the form : @xmath31 where @xmath11 is the tunneling direction , the exponential factor characterizes tunneling without interaction with phonons , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is a slowly varying envelope function .",
    "slow variation of @xmath33 follows from the weakness of electron - phonon interaction and leads to the possibility of neglect of its second derivative with respect to @xmath11 , @xmath34 .",
    "( [ eq : a1 ] ) becomes @xmath35 where @xmath36 designates the gradient with respect to the perpendicular to tunneling direction @xmath11 ( in the two - dimensional case @xmath37 ) .",
    "this schrdinger equation is just equivalent to a non - stationary schrdinger equation where @xmath38 plays the role of imaginary time and there are two spatial dimensions instead of the original three .",
    "the transmission across the barrier is characterized by the solution to eq.([eq : gfm.pa.1 ] ) with the boundary ( `` initial '' ) condition @xmath39 .",
    "it can be written as @xmath40 then the transmission coefficient is given by ( multiplied by @xmath41 which is due to the parabolic approximation ) @xmath42 where the angular brackets mean the averaging over the phonon configuration . due to",
    "translational invariance the average of the green function product depend on the difference @xmath43 so that the rhs does not depend of @xmath44 .    in the case of tunneling in the presence of a random field",
    "the average of the green function product mixes both green functions , i.e. , it is not equal to the product of averages .",
    "the situation is much simpler in the case of phonons under the static approximation .",
    "the neglect of phonon emission means that @xmath45 in the lhs of eq.([eq : gfm.pa.3 ] ) corresponds to the phonon ground state . in other words , for the calculation of the transmission coefficient we have to keep only the diagonal with respect to phonons part of the green function .",
    "this diagonal part is obtained by the averaging of @xmath46 over the phonon configuration , @xmath47 .",
    "it is convenient to calculate @xmath48 in the fourier representation .",
    "actually we perform fourier transformation for the perpendicular direction and a laplace transformation for the @xmath11 direction . after",
    "these transformations eq.([eq : gfm.pa.1 ] ) becomes @xmath49 where @xmath50 are the fourier and laplace transforms of @xmath33 with respect to the perpendicular and @xmath11 directions respectively and @xmath51 . throughout the paper",
    "we will use the notation @xmath22 for the laplace transformation parameter ( imaginary @xmath11-component of the electron wave vector ) , @xmath52 for the electron wave vector in the plane perpendicular to the tunneling direction and @xmath53 for the phonon wave vector .",
    "the transmission coefficient now is @xmath54 where @xmath55 calculating the transmission coefficient thus amounts to calculating the averaged green function .",

    "the other point , that in the static approximation the two - particle green function ,",
    "eq.([eq : gfm.pa.3 ] ) , equals the product of two one - particle green functions , has already been mentioned .",
    "it is also possible to demonstrate this last point diagrammaticly , showing that in the static approximation , due to momentum conservation , diagrams with random field lines connecting two green functions contain the factor @xmath60 , where @xmath6 is the volume of the system .    due to the weak coupling between electrons and phonons , in most of the cases that we consider a good approximation of the self - energy",

    "the divergences can be eliminated with the help of the standard renormalization procedure ( see , e.g. , ref . ) . for the deformation potential coupling the large constant term @xmath80 ( which has a form @xmath81 where @xmath82 is a numerical constant )",

    "the terms @xmath109 in eq.([eq : f2 ] ) and @xmath110 in eq.([eq : f1 ] ) become large compared to @xmath111 as @xmath22 goes to zero .",
    "thus the perturbation theory in this case is not sufficient .",
    "a similar problem was encountered by delshten when he studied the piezoelectric polaron@xcite .",
    "he considered high order vertex corrections and showed that in each order of the perturbation theory the highest power of the logarithm comes from diagrams with non - crossing phonon lines . neglecting all other diagrams he succeeded in obtaining an equation for a vertex correction .",
    "because the origin of the logarithmic divergence in delshten s case and ours is the same we can use the same approximation . in the following calculation we follow closely the derivation presented in ref ..    in the following discussion and calculation we will treat the three dimensional case the treatment of the two dimensional case is very similar therefore only the results shall be presented for it .",
    "we start by considering vertex corrections . the first vertex correction , @xmath112 , presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] :    @xmath113    the integral is calculated in appendix [ ap : leading - order ] giving @xmath114 where @xmath115  ( @xmath22 is either @xmath116 or @xmath117 , since under logarithmic accuracy the difference between them can be ignored , for the same reason @xmath118 is either @xmath119 or @xmath120 ) .",
    "for @xmath74 the same result can be obtained from the self - energy ( [ eq : f2 ] ) with the help of the ward identity .",
    "for the two dimensional case the first vertex correction is @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "the calculation of this integral can also be found in appendix [ ap : leading - order ] .",
    "the second order diagrams for the vertex corrections are presented in fig.[fig3 ] . the diagram ( 3,a ) is reduced to the renormalization of the green function .",
    "it is possible to show that the leading order contribution to the diagram ( 3,d ) is of the order of @xmath123 containing lower power of the logarithm than the power of @xmath124 .",
    "the leading order contribution to the other two diagram is of the order of @xmath125 , i.e. , the power of the logarithm equals the power of the coupling constant .",
    "the same relation holds true for more complicated diagrams .",
    "that is , diagrams containing intersections of phonon lines contain lower power of the logarithm than the power of the coupling constant and diagrams without such an intersection get another power of the logarithm in every next order of the perturbation theory .",
    "the last statement can be proven in the following way .",
    "the increase of the order of the perturbation theory by unity in a vertex diagram without intersection of phonon lines corresponds to the replacement of one of the bare vertices in this diagram by @xmath112 .",
    "similar to the calculation in appendix [ ap : leading - order ] , the values of the momentum in the contour of this new @xmath112 that give the main contribution are much larger than the momentum in external contours but much smaller than @xmath83 .",
    "so this @xmath112 again gives a logarithmic contribution .",
    "another result of such a calculation is that in diagrams without phonon line crossings the variables @xmath22 and @xmath118 enter only in the combination @xmath115 .",
    "thus when @xmath126 is small enough , e.g. the effective potential barrier is high enough , one can neglect diagrams containing phonon intersection lines .",
    "the summation of all other diagrams leads to the equation for the vertex @xmath127 presented in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "since the green function and the vertex correction are functions of @xmath128 , the ward identity is expressed in the following form : @xmath129 integrating eq .",
    "( [ eq : f6 ] ) and making use of the fact @xmath127 is a slow function we get @xmath130 the substitution of this expression in the equation presented in fig.[fig4 ] leads to the cancellation of two vertices and resulting in a linear equation for the vertex function .",
    "the main contribution to the integral term in this equation comes from the region where the momentum in the contour in fig.[fig4 ] is much larger than the external momenta .",
    "similar to the calculation of @xmath131 , the difference between the external momenta is not important and they have to be kept only to limit the value of otherwise logarithmically divergent integral . so the equation can be written in the following form @xmath132 in this integral @xmath133 and the terms @xmath134 and @xmath128 are small compared to @xmath135 .",
    "so these terms can be neglected in the argument of @xmath127 ( it is a slow function ) and @xmath136 can be neglected in the coefficient of @xmath134 in the denominator ( the exact value of this term is not important ) .",

    "we considered a small coupling and used two main approximations : the static approximation and the parabolic approximation .",
    "contrary to the one - dimensional case @xcite , the main effect of the deformation potential coupling is the barrier and the electron mass renormalization . on the top of this",

    "the small coupling constants enters in the power .",
    "this result resembles piezoelectric polaron . when the barrier is wide enough the piezoelectric coupling can lead to a substantial reduction of the tunneling probability .",
    "it is interesting also to compare the sign of the coupling effect in one- and higher dimensions . in one - dimensional case",
    "the coupling led to an enhancement of the tunneling probability .",
    "the physics behind this is that an electron chooses for tunneling the most favorable phonon configuration.@xcite in high - dimensional case , due to ultra - violet divergences , such favorable phonon configurations led to overall renormalization of the barrier which can not be separated from the bare barrier .",
    "the measurable effect depending on the length of the barrier is a reduction of the tunneling probability .    in both cases the effects mentioned",
    "are enhanced when tunneling is near the top of the barrier , though as the effective potential barrier height , @xmath28 , is lowered two effects become important : dynamical corrections to our static approximation and an effect which can be described as channeling , the change of the electron wave function due to the interaction with phonons .",

    "<S> we treat a tunneling electron coupled to acoustical phonons through a realistic electron phonon interaction : deformation potential and piezoelectric , in two or three - dimensional tunneling configurations . making use of slowness of the phonon system compared to electron tunneling , and using a green function method for imaginary time , we are able to calculate the change in the transition probability due to the coupling to phonons . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown using standard renormalization procedure that , contrary to the one - dimensional case , second order perturbation theory is sufficient in order to treat the deformation potential coupling , which leads to a small correction to the transmission coefficient prefactor . in the case of piezoelectric coupling , which is found to be closely related to the piezoelectric polaron problem , </S>",
    "<S> vertex corrections need to be considered . summing leading logarithmic terms </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the piezoelectric coupling leads to a significant change of the transmission coefficient . </S>"
