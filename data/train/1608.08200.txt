    "is chosen carefully , i.e. slow enough to avoid any excitations of breathing modes in the gas .      in our experiment ,",
    "the 1d coupling constant @xmath69 quantifying interactions in the host gas is set by the scattering length @xmath0 via @xcite @xmath70 here , @xmath71 is the radial oscillator length .",
    "analogously , the scattering length for collisions between impurity and host atoms @xmath24 sets the coupling constant @xmath72 .",
    "the derivation of the dimensionless interaction strengths @xmath9 and @xmath12 further requires knowledge of the host gas density . to this end , we first deduce the distribution of the atomic sample across the array of 1d tubes .",
    "assuming sufficiently small interactions during the adiabatic lattice loading , so that all tubes are in the 1d thomas - fermi regime , the atom number @xmath73 for the tube ( @xmath74 ) can be derived iteratively from the global chemical potential ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "for each tube , we then model the 1d density distribution @xmath75 individually by numerically solving the lieb - liniger system and making a local density approximation @xcite . the derived peak 1d density in each tube @xmath76 together with @xmath73 provides the local and ensemble averaged values for @xmath9 , @xmath12 and @xmath14              the presence of the magnetic field gradient @xmath83 causes a @xmath57-dependent resonance frequency for the transfer of host gas atoms into the state @xmath84 .",

    ", we determine the momentum distribution of the impurity atoms via an in - tube stern - gerlach separation of the two magnetic zeeman substates @xmath91 ( host gas atoms ) and @xmath92 ( impurities ) . in more detail , after the variable hold time @xmath26 during which the impurities are accelerated and interact with their host liquids , we quickly set the scattering length @xmath24 sufficiently close to zero so that any subsequent impurity dynamics is now solely determined by gravity .",
