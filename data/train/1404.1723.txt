    "notwithstanding its experimental successes , the standard model ( sm ) is widely believed to be an effective theory valid up to a certain scale , above which some new physics ( np ) takes over .",
    "there are several motivations for such an ultraviolet completing np , e.g. , the fine - tuning problem of the physical scalar mass , the existence of massive neutrinos and the cold dark matter , etc .",
    "the scalar mass receives a quadratically divergent quantum correction , because there is no symmetry to protect the scalar mass , like the gauge symmetry for gauge bosons or chiral symmetry for fermions .",
    "if the sm is valid up to an energy scale @xmath1 , the mass of the higgs boson , instead of being @xmath2 gev , is expected to be of the order of @xmath1 , unless there is an unnatural fine - tuning between the bare mass term and the quantum corrections .",
    "the standard way out is to appeal to some new symmetry or somehow bring down the planck scale to soften the fine - tuning .",
    "let us assume that there is some yet - to - be - discovered symmetry , which protects the scalar mass .",
    "in fact , some well - explored mechanisms , like supersymmetry , may provide this protection , but we will be more interested to use a bottom - up approach along with the principle of occam s razor , and try to find the minimal field content that can do the job . in the framework of cut - off regularization ( which",
    ", though not lorentz invariant , is more intuitive as this separates the quadratic and logarithmic divergences , and the fine - tuning problem depends on the quadratically divergent terms ) , the sum of all quadratic divergences in the radiative corrections to the scalar self energy is set to zero , which is also known as the veltman condition ( vc ) @xcite . a slightly different vc results if one uses dimensional regularization @xcite . in the sm",
    ", the vc can be written in terms of the masses of the higgs boson , the gauge bosons , and the top quark , and , unfortunately , is far from being satisfied ; the required higgs mass is more than 300 gev .",
    "the role of the vc in looking for the possible directions of np has been well - investigated in the literature .",
    "for example , a possible extension of the sm by one or more gauge singlet scalars satisfying the vc , and its possible ramifications in collider searches , as a cold dark matter candidate , or as a gateway to an ultraviolet complete theory , have been discussed in detail in refs .",
    "it is easy to check that to satisfy the vc for the sm higgs boson , one needs an extension by bosonic fields that couple to the former and hence contribute to the quadratic divergence .",
    "a minimally extended scalar sector is enough if one is interested only in the fine - tuning of the sm higgs ; however , one would naturally expect to satisfy the vc for the new scalars too .",
    "if the new scalars do not couple to the sm fermions ( like the singlet extension ) , one has to bring in some new fermions at the same time .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the extension of the sm with a complex triplet scalar @xcite . why a scalar extension",
    "? as we will show , cancellation of quadratic divergences to the higgs mass requires extra bosonic degrees of freedom that couple to the sm higgs at the tree - level .",
    "extra gauge fields can also be invoked , but one anyway needs more scalars to give them mass in a gauge - invariant way .",
    "an alternative option , the two - higgs doublet models , has been discussed elsewhere @xcite .",
    "triplet scalars have received a lot of attention in the literature , including a detailed study of couplings and mass spectrum @xcite , radiative corrections , renormalizability issues , and precision observables @xcite , enhancement of the @xmath3 branching ratio @xcite , and collider studies @xcite . however",
    ", their main appeal lies in neutrino mass generation through the see - saw mechanism @xcite with a lepton number ( @xmath4 ) violating interaction , and also the type - ii leptogenesis scenario @xcite . as the complex triplet can couple to left - handed leptons to generate majorana masses for the neutrinos through @xmath5 terms , there is no need to introduce any additional fermions in the model .",
    "the stability and unitarity conditions of such triplet models in the light of a 125 gev higgs boson have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the triplet is , of course , restricted from the @xmath0-parameter to be at most of a few gev @xcite .",
    "however , it is more than enough to generate the neutrino masses if the corresponding yukawa couplings are of order unity .",
    "this is why we do not consider the extension of the sm with one complex and one real triplet , keeping the custodial su(2 ) intact , which may give a large vev for the neutral triplets @xcite .",
    "the mixing between the triplet and doublet states is proportional to the triplet vev , which , being tiny , makes the mixing small too @xcite .",
    "thus , the 125 gev scalar is almost a pure doublet , which is completely consistent with its production cross - section and decay branching ratios .",
    "we will show that the introduction of a complex triplet can successfully address the naturalness problem for the doublet .",
    "further multiplets , triplets or otherwise , might also help , but here we will try to keep the life simple by considering only the minimal extension , and that too without introducing any extra fermions .",
    "one notes that as the number of scalars increases , there is a compulsion to apply the naturalness condition to all of them , unless some of them happen to be extremely heavy ( in which case they get frozen and do not contribute to the radiative corrections at a low energy ) . for the triplet scalars",
    ", the naturalness problem is addressed through its coupling to the leptons .",
    "one has also to take into account the stability conditions of the scalar potential .",
    "as will be seen , the potential of this model becomes unstable at a high energy scale ; the scale depends on the initial choice of parameters but is at a few thousand tev .",
    "one might argue that the potential could be made stable with higher - order corrections ; even then , some of the couplings grow large and hit a landau pole somewhere below @xmath6 tev , which indicates the maximum energy where some np must supersede the effective theory .",
    "we find out the parameter space for such a triplet - enhanced sm consistent with the vc as well as the stability of the scalar potential .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in section",
    "ii , we show the complete scalar potential , the corresponding veltman conditions , and the one - loop renormalization group ( rg ) equations for all the relevant couplings .",
    "in section iii , we study the rg evolution of the couplings and its possible consequences .",
    "section iv is on the scalar spectrum of such a model .",
    "we summarize and conclude in section v.",
    "in the sm , with the scalar potential of the form v ( ) = -^2^+ ( ^)^2 , the higgs boson self - energy receives a quadratically divergent correction m_h^2 = ( 6 + 34 g_1 ^ 2 + 94 g_2 ^ 2 - 6 g_t^2 ) , [ smvc ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the u(1)@xmath9 ( not gut - normalized ) and su(2)@xmath10 gauge couplings respectively , and @xmath11 is the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "we treat all other fermions as massless , and use the cut - off regularization , @xmath1 being the cutoff scale .",
    "the veltman condition ( vc ) demands that the quantity inside the parentheses in eq .",
    "( [ smvc ] ) be made zero , or at least controllably small , by some symmetry .",
    "there are further quadratic divergences coming from two - loop diagrams , but they are suppressed from one - loop contributions by a factor of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the regularization scale , and we will neglect them here .",
    "one can say that the quadratic divergence is under control if , say , @xmath14 , which translates into m_h^2 + 2m_w^2 + m_z^2 - 4m_t^2 m_h^2 .",
    "[ smvc2 ] this inequality is satisfied in the sm only for @xmath15 , or @xmath16 gev , which means that we should expect a np at this scale .",
    "this , however , is almost ruled out by the lhc .",
    "( [ smvc ] ) also shows that one needs a bosonic contribution to satisfy the veltman condition .",
    "let us now enhance the scalar sector with a complex triplet @xmath17 , with weak hypercharge @xmath18 .",
    "the vevs are ^0= ,   x^0= v_2",
    ". we can express the triplet in a bidoublet notation : x=    x^+/ & x^++x^0 & -x^+/    , and the generic form of the @xmath5 terms is v_l = 2 = - i f_ab l_a^t c^-1 _ 2 x l_b + h.c .",
    ", where @xmath19 is the charge conjugation operator , and @xmath20 is the left - handed lepton doublet .",
    "if there is no leptonic flavor - changing neutral current , we can take the yukawa coupling @xmath21 to be diagonal . for subsequent discussion",
    ", we will not only assume @xmath21 to be diagonal but also to be a multiple of the unit matrix : @xmath22 . while this seems to be at variance with the neutrino data , any form that correctly reproduces the neutrino masses and mixing hardly changes our conclusions . to generate the mixing angles .",
    "anyway , a detailed discussion of neutrino mass matrix is outside the scope of this paper . ]",
    "the scalar potential can be written as @xcite v = v_2 + v_3 + v_4 , where the individual terms are v_2 & = & -_1 ^ 2(^ ) + _ 2 ^ 2(x^x ) , + v_3 & = & -a_0 ( x^ ) + h.c .",

    "there is a global o(2 ) symmetry in the neutral scalar sector , so that there will be a physical goldstone boson in the spectrum if both neutral fields acquire vev .",

    "<S> we consider the extension of the standard model by a complex scalar triplet field , which occurs naturally in several models of leptogenesis and see - saw mechanism for neutrino mass generation , in the context of ameliorating the fine - tuning problem of the fundamental scalars through the veltman condition , i.e.  by demanding the sum of the quadratically divergent corrections to vanish ( or be at a reasonable level ) by virtue of some possible symmetry of the underlying theory . we show that it is possible to cancel all the scalar one - loop quadratic divergences and hence obtain a viable solution for the fine - tuning problem , while satisfying the electroweak precision observables , including the @xmath0 parameter , and successfully generating the neutrino masses . </S>",
