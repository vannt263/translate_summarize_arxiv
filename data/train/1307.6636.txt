    "moreover , it was shown also that there is no physical open string excitations around the solution @xcite . following the success of finding the tachyon vacuum , general multi - brane solutions have been studied actively @xcite .",

    "evaluation of the gio for the pure - gauge type solutions with a rational function @xmath24 by using the @xmath55-regularization ( see below ) leads to @xmath29 independent result @xcite : @xmath56 = -\\lim_{z\\to 0}\\frac{z}{g(z)}{\\partial}_z g(z)=-n_0 .",

    "are the canonical energy and the gravitational coupling inequivalent to each other for multi - brane solutions ? or is the gio insufficient as the gravitational coupling ?    a key to a resolution to this problem was given in @xcite .",

    "then the rhs with this improvement is manifestly inversion symmetric .",
    "we claim that the genuine gravitational coupling should be given by the gio plus our newly added term for multi - brane solutions .    before finishing the introduction , we comment on the regularization and the eom . in order to treat properly a topological quantity @xmath8",
    "as given by , we need a regularization for singularities at @xmath1 and @xmath58 .",
    "we introduce one regularization common to all the solutions . for regularizing the @xmath1 singularity",
    ", we make the replacement @xmath59 in correlators written in terms of @xmath60 and @xmath23 .",
    "we call the @xmath61-regularization",
    ". since the eigenvalues of @xmath21 are non - negative , @xmath61-regularization works well .",
    "next , the regularization for @xmath2 is naturally obtained as the inversion transformation of the @xmath55-regularization . combining the both and introducing the regularization parameter @xmath62 for @xmath2 , our regularization",
