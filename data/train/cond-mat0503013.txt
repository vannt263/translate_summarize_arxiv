    "the berry phase theory @xcite allowed to generalize the idea of aharonov - bohm effect @xcite on electrons in the electromagnetic potential , to an analogous effect related to a gauge potential , which arises during the adiabatic motion of a quantum system in a parametric space . up to now",

    "such quasiparticles are usually viewed as the elementary excitations of the ordered homogeneous state of a ferromagnet but they can be also used to classify the excited states near a metastable inhomogeneous magnetic configuration .",

    "usually , the magnons play a negative role in the magnetization dynamics limiting the frequency of magnetic reversal , and also leading to the energy dissipation .",
    "however , they can be probably used in the spin transport phenomena like the spin currents of magnetically polarized electrons .    here",
    "we study the energy spectrum of spin waves in ferromagnets with a static inhomogeneous magnetization profile , and we demonstrate a possibility of observation of the berry phase in the interference experiments on spin waves in magnetic nanostructures .",
    "recent results of the micromagnetic computer simulation@xcite of such systems demonstrate that the interference of spin waves can be really observed in magnetic nanorings with domain walls .",
