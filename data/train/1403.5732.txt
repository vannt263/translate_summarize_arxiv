    "the recent detection of b - mode polarization made by the bicep2 experiment @xcite clearly represents one of the major discovery in cosmology in the past twenty years .",
    "while the bicep2 result clearly needs to be confirmed by future experiments , it is timely and important to fully analyze the bicep2 data and to identify all possible inconsistencies at the theoretical level .    in this brief note",
    "we focus our attention on the spectral index of tensor fluctuations @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , a crucial prediction of inflation is the production of a stochastic background of gravity waves ( @xcite ) with a slightly tilted spectrum ,    @xmath8    where @xmath9 denotes a slow roll parameter from inflation ( @xmath10 is the hubble rate during the inflationary stage ) .    in standard inflation @xmath11",
    "is strictly positive  @xcite and in the usual parameter estimation routines , the tensor spectral index is assumed to be `` red '' , or negligible .",
    "however , in recent years , a set of inflationary models has been elaborated where the spectral index of tensor modes could be positive , @xmath12 , i.e. `` blue '' .",
    "a first attempt to compare these models with observational data has been made in @xcite .",
    "the main theoretical problem for the production of a blue spectrum of gravitational waves ( bgw ) is that the stress - energy tensor must violate the so - called null energy condition ( nec ) . in a spatially flat frw metric ,",
    "a violation of nec indeed corresponds to the inequality @xmath13 and is ultimately the reason for the red tensor spectrum in standard inflation .",
    "models that violates nec have been already presented .",
    "for example , in the so - called super - inflation models @xcite where inflation is driven by a component violating the nec a bgw spectrum is expected .",
    "models based on string gas cosmology as in @xcite , where scalar metric perturbations are thought to originate from initial string thermodynamic fluctuations @xcite , also can explain a bgw background .",
    "a bgw spectrum is also a generic prediction of a class of four - dimensional models with a bouncing phase of the universe @xcite . to induce the bounce ,",
    "the stress - energy tensor must violate the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "g - inflation @xcite , has a galileon - like nonlinear derivative interaction in the lagrangian with the resultant equations of motion being of second order . in this model ,",
    "violation of the null energy condition can occur and the spectral index of tensor modes can be blue .",
    "bgw may also be present in scalar - tensor theories and @xmath14 gravity theories .",
    "it is therefore timely to investigate the constraints on the tensor spectral index @xmath0 from the bicep2 data .",
    "strangely enough , no constraint on this parameter has been presented by the bicep2 collaboration while , as we discuss in the next section , we found that the bicep2 data could provide interesting results on this parameter .",
    "our analysis method is based on the boltzmann camb code  @xcite and a monte carlo markov chain ( mcmc ) analysis based on the mcmc package ` cosmomc `  @xcite ( version december 2013 ) .",
    "we have implemented in the mcmc package the likelihood code provided by the bicep2 team ( we just use bb data ) . and considered as free parameters the ratio of the tensor to scalar amplitude @xmath15 at @xmath16 , defined as @xmath17 , and the tensor spectral index @xmath0 .",
    "we prefer to use the pivot scale at @xmath18 since the bicep2 data is most sensitive to multipole @xmath19 and using the approximate formula @xmath20 .",
    "all the remaining parameters have been kept fixed at the planck+wp best fit values for the lcdm+r scenario ( see @xcite ) .    moreover , since the tensor amplitude should also be consistent with the upper limits on @xmath15 coming from measurements of the temperature power spectrum , we have assumed a prior of @xmath21 at @xmath22 c.l .",
    "( see @xcite ) .",
    "we refer to this prior as the `` tt '' prior .",
    "note that the tt prior is taken at much larger scales , @xmath23 than those sampled by the bicep2 experiments .",
    "as we show in the next section this prior is extremely important for the constraints on @xmath0 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the results of our analysis are reported in table i and figure 1 . we consider four cases : @xmath0 free , @xmath0 free but with the tt prior , @xmath0 assumed to be negative ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath0 assumed to be negative plus the tt prior .",
    "we can derive the following conclusions :    * the bicep2 data alone slightly prefers a positive spectral index .",
    "the case @xmath4 is consistent with the data in between two standard deviations .",
    "* when a tt prior of @xmath21 at @xmath22 c.l .. is assumed , the bicep2 data strongly prefers a blue spectral index with @xmath24 excluded at more than three standard deviations .",
    "* if we restrict the analysis to negative @xmath0 we obtain a lower limit of @xmath25 at @xmath2 c.l .",
    "( @xmath7 in case of the tt prior ) .",
    "in this brief note we have presented new constraints on the spectral index @xmath0 of tensor fluctuations from the recent data obtained by the bicep2 experiment .",
    "we found that the bicep2 data alone slightly prefers a positive , `` blue '' , spectral index with @xmath1 at @xmath2 c.l .. however , when a tt prior on the tensor amplitude coming from temperature anisotropy measurements is assumed we get @xmath3 at @xmath2 c.l . , ruling out a scale invariant @xmath4 spectrum at more than three standard deviations .",
    "considering only the possibility of a `` red '' , @xmath5 spectral index we obtain the lower limit @xmath6 at @xmath2 c.l .",
    "( @xmath7 when a tt prior is included ) .",
    "these results are at odds with current upper limits on the tensor spectral index coming from observations of pulsar timing , big bang nucleosynthesis , and from direct upper limits from the ligo experiment ( see e.g. @xcite ) . considering @xmath26 and using the method adopted in @xcite we found the current upper limits on @xmath0 : @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath2 c.l . from pulsar timing , ligo and bbn respectively .",
    "the ligo and bbn limits are in strong tension with the bicep2+cmb value .",
    "therefore a positive spectral index does not provide an acceptable solution to the tension between the bicep2 data and current upper limits on @xmath15 from temperature anisotropies .",
    "this indicates either the need of including extra parameters ( as the running of the scalar spectral index @xcite or extra neutrino species @xcite ) to relax current bounds on @xmath30 from temperature anisotropies or the presence of unresolved systematics in current cmb data .    during the submission of this paper other works appeared discussing the possibility of a bgw from bicep2 ( see @xcite ) but without presenting numerical constraints on @xmath0 and an independent analysis of the bicep2 data .",
    "we also like to point out the discussion on the ` cosmocoffee.info ` website where results similar to ours have been presented by antony lewis .",
