    "imaging cherenkov telescopes have proven to be the most successful tool developed so far to explore the cosmic gamma rays of energies above few hundred gev .",
    "a pioneering generation of installations has been able to detect a handful of sources and start a whole program of very exciting physics studies . now",
    "a second generation of more sophisticated telescopes is starting to operate and is providing already with new exciting observations .",
    "one of the main characteristics of some of these new telescopes @xcite , is the potential ability to reduce the gamma ray energy threshold below @xmath0 gev , helping to fill the existing observational energy gap between the detector on satellites and the ground - based installations .    in the framework of the standard model of particle interactions , high energy gamma rays traversing cosmological distances",
    "are expected to be absorbed by their interaction with the diffuse background radiation fields , or `` extragalactic background light '' ( ebl ) , producing @xmath1 pairs .",
    "the @xmath2 cross section is strongly picked to @xmath3 and therefore , there is a specific range in the ebl energy which is `` probed '' by each gamma ray energy @xcite .",
    "this effect should lead to the existence of a `` gamma ray horizon '' , limiting the feasibility of observing very high energy gamma rays coming from very far distances .",
    "the actual value of this horizon distance for gamma rays of a given energy , depends on the number density of the diffuse background radiation of the relevant energy range , which is traversed by the gamma rays . in the range of gamma ray energies which can be effectively studied by the next generation of gamma ray telescopes ( from , say , 10 gev to 50 tev ) ,",
    "the most relevant ebl component is the ultraviolet ( uv ) to infrared ( ir ) contribution .",
    "several models have been developed to try to predict that ebl density @xcite .",
    "these models do a quite complex convolution of the measurements of star formation rate , initial mass function and dust and light recycling history .",
    "the result is a set of relatively model - independent predictions which accuracy is improving as the quality of their astrophysics inputs improves with the new deep - field observations and which fits reasonably well the existing data .",
    "therefore , quantitative predictions of the gamma ray horizon have already been made but , unfortunately , so far no clear confirmation can be drawn from the observations of the present generation of gamma ray telescopes .",
    "on the one hand , some very high energy gamma ray events might have been observed from mkn 501 , a blazar at redshift @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the mere observation of these events would somehow contradict the above predictions indicating , might be , the presence of a new mechanism violating the forementionned gamma - gamma reaction threshold , for which , for instance , lorenz - invariance violation has been advocated , as we ll discuss later .",
    "unfortunately , the statistics is scarce and for these events the actual systematic uncertainty in the energy determination might be large and hence the situation remains somewhat unclear",
    ". on the other hand , for the handful of presently well established extragalactic sources ( all of them at modest redshifts ) , no clear observation of a common energy cutoff which could be attributed to the gamma absorption in the intergalactic medium instead of simply to internal source characteristics , has been established so far . nevertheless , for mkn 501 a clear exponential energy spectrum cutoff has been observed and , under the assumption that its origin is the ebl absorption , upper limits on the ebl density in agreement with the expectations",
    "have been placed @xcite .",
    "the fact that the new generation of cherenkov telescopes will reach a considerably lower energy threshold than the previous one should be of paramount importance in improving the present experimental situation for , at least , two reasons :    * lower energy points with a much smaller uncertainty , due to the steep spectra , will be added to the spectra of the already observed sources allowing to disentangle much better the overall flux and spectral index from the cutoff position in the spectrum fit . *",
    "sources at higher redshift should be observable , giving a stronger lever arm in constraining the predictions and the possibility of observing a plethora of new sources that will allow unfolding the emission spectra and the gamma absorption .",
    "the goal of this work is to analyse the physics potential of this new generation of telescopes in the measurement of the gamma ray horizon and more specifically its impact in the understanding of the various models and parameters involved in its predictions . for this",
    ", the work is structured in two parts .    the first part , which is the one covered in the present paper , concerns the theoretical predictions . in this part , first the definition of the terms used in this work and their calculational procedure are reviewed in detail .",
    "then , the theoretical predictions obtained for the gamma ray horizon for different ebl approaches and also for different cosmological parameter sets are presented .",
    "finally plausible scenarios that could effect the gamma ray horizon predictions are commented . the actual sensitivity to these models and parameters",
    "is discussed .",
    "the second part , which will be presented in a fore - coming paper , will deal with the prospective on what the experimental scenario might look like and a discussion on how much one can expect to pinpoint the parameters of the theory ( with special emphasis on the cosmological ones)in the extrapolated data scenario .",
    "in this section the detailed calculation of the gamma ray horizon in terms of the predicted ebl density spectra is presented .",
    "our strategy has been performing the complete calculation without any approximation by using a numerical integration approach .",
    "different ansatzs for the calculation of the ebl predictions have been also analysed to see their impact on the gamma ray horizon prediction .",
    "also , the dependence on all the intervening parameters has been kept explicit to be able to track the effect of the different hypotheses in the final prediction .",
    "the optical depth can be written with its explicit redshift and energy dependence@xcite as    @xmath5 \\label{eq : opd}\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the energy of the @xmath8-ray,@xmath9 is the energy of the ebl photon , z is the redshift of the considered source and @xmath10 is the spectral density at the given z.    the predicted value of the optical depth depends on several physical parameters .",
    "a part from the dependence on the actual absorption process , which enters through the gamma - gamma cross section , and the direct dependence on the cosmological parameters @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 introduced by the geodesic radial displacement function , the spectral energy density is also an input parameter .",
    "there exists observational data with determinations and bounds of the background energy density at @xmath14 for several energies @xcite .",
    "the determinations come from direct measurements of the ebl density using instruments on satellites whereas the bounds , happen mostly in the infrared part of the ebl and come from extrapolations using galaxy counting .",
    "given the difficulty of observing `` cold galaxies '' due to the zodiacal light background , they provide just lower limits .    several models , which fit the observational data of @xmath15 , have been suggested @xcite ( a set of predictions for the most significant models can be seen in figure  [ fig : sedatz0 ] ) .",
    "these models do not provide all the necessary information for our calculation : they provide a description of spectral density at @xmath14 while we need to know also the evolution of @xmath16 as a function of @xmath17 .",
    "[ fig : sedatz0 ]    in this note three different approaches , which represent somehow limiting cases in the complexity of the ansatz assumed , for the @xmath17 evolution of the ebl have been used .",
    "their comparison should give a feeling on how much the predictions change with the complexity of the theoretical assumptions and , hence , they might provide a tool to estimate how large the theoretical uncertainties in the final predictions might be . ordered in increasing complexity",
    ", these approaches are :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 1 .",

    "is defined as the source redshift for which the optical depth is @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , the gamma ray horizon gives , for each gamma ray energy , the redshift location @xmath17 of a source for which the intrinsic gamma flux suffers an e - fold decrease when observed on earth @xmath14 due to the gamma - gamma absorption .    in practice ,",
    "the cut - off due to the optical depth is completely folded with the spectral emission of the gamma source .",
    "but on the other hand , the suppression factor in the gamma flux due to the optical depth depends only ( assuming a specific cosmology and spectral ebl density ) on the gamma energy and the redshift of the source .",
    "therefore , a common gamma energy spectrum behaviour of a set of different gamma sources at the same redshift is most likely due to the optical depth .",
    "the goal of this note has been studying the effect of the cosmological parameters and the different spectral density models in the gamma ray horizon predictions for the gamma ray energy region covered by the next generation of gamma ray telescopes .",
    "the results of this study are presented in the next section .",
    "as already mentioned , for any given energy of the gamma ray that travels through the universe , the probability of interaction with the ebl photons to create @xmath19 pairs has a strong dependence with the energy of the background photons . roughly speaking , each gamma energy `` probes '' a different ebl photon energy and",
    "therefore , the trends of the ebl spectrum as a function of the photon energy @xmath9 as well as its redshift evolution are reflected in the optical depth as a function of gamma energy @xmath7 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : optdep ] the optical depth for gamma rays coming from a set of different redshifts are shown as a function of the gamma ray energy .",
    "as already mentioned , in the comoving frame , the @xmath2 reaction has the maximum probability when @xmath20 .",
    "this means that the flat zone seen in figure  [ fig : optdep ] corresponds to gamma rays that interact mainly with ebl between roughly @xmath21 ev and @xmath22 ev ( depending on the source redshift ) , where the density of ebl photons has a sharp break down ( figure  [ fig : sedatz0 ] ) . on the other hand , while the gamma rays explore the peaks due to the star radiation and the absorption and reemission in the interstellar medium , the optical depth keeps increasing but with a non - constant slope .    in figure",
    "[ fig : grhdensity ] ( dotted line ) the grh that we get solving numerically the equation @xmath23 is shown . on the one hand , it is clear that from redshift @xmath24 onwards , it is quite flat , so that gammas of energy about @xmath25 gev could reach the earth from any distance in the observable universe . on the other hand",
    "the grh depends strongly on the redshift for @xmath26 .",
    "the gamma ray horizon has been calculated for the three different evolutions of @xmath27 already mentioned .",
    "for the first and second approaches ( `` burst of star formation at high redshift '' and `` parameterisation of the star formation rate '' ) a model which defines the @xmath28 has to be chosen . in figure",
    "[ fig : grhdensity ] , a specific model for @xmath28 @xcite and specific values for the madau curve ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) , which agree with recent data @xcite , have been used .",
    "the third model , namely the `` star formation rate and star evolution '' assumption , is likely the closest to reality , so it is going to be used for all further studies in this work and , in fact , has already been used as a particular example in the previous sections .",
    "the fact that we will stick to this approach and that no error bars are shown in figure  [ fig : grhdensity ] , does not mean that this prediction is free from theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this model has a lot of inputs that come from cosmological measurements which have , in fact , quite large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "for instance , if one would assume a fit to the star formation rate in the redshift region for @xmath33 as the classical madau curve @xcite instead of a slowly decreasing rate , this would produce a sizeable change in the grh ( @xmath34 gev ) prediction at large redshift .",
    "the uncertainty for low redshifts can be estimated by computing the grh for several models of @xmath28 , which produce a factor @xmath35 difference in the grh energy prediction for @xmath36 independently of the model used for its evolution .",
    "as we have already commented , some fundamental cosmological parameters such as the hubble constant and the cosmological densities play also an important role in the calculation of the gamma ray horizon since they provide the bulk of the @xmath17 dependence of our predictions .    over the last few years",
    ", the confidence in the experimental determinations of these cosmological parameters has increased dramatically . to understand the effect of moving these parameters , the values quoted in table  [ tab : bestfit ]",
    "have been used .",
    ".best current fit values for cosmological parameters with 1 @xmath37 confidence level@xcite . [ cols=\"<,<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     before we discuss the impact of each one of these parameters in our predictions we would like to see how actually the observables that we will measure ( optical depths and grh ) depend on the redshift @xmath17 to compare it with the redshift dependence of other observables . for that",
    ", we have plotted the prediction for their @xmath17 evolution in figure [ fig : z - evolution ] . in that figure , for each observable it is shown the prediction normalized to the value at @xmath38 . for comparison , the @xmath17 variation of the luminosity - distance , used for the determination of the cosmological parameters using supernova 1a observations and of the geodesical - distance , giving the gamma ray path length , are shown .",
    "one can see that the optical depth has a quite different behaviour depending on the gamma ray energy explored .",
    "the @xmath17 dependence is very pronounced at large redshifts for @xmath39 gev gammas and approaches a `` geodesical - distance''-like shape for @xmath40 tev gamma rays .",
    "the reason for that is the actual shape of the ebl spectrum and its redshift evolution . to give a feeling of the actual average @xmath17 dependence of the optical depth",
    ", the prediction for a flat @xmath41 ebl spectrum is also shown .",
    "finally , the @xmath17 dependence of the inverse of the grh energy is also shown .    now , to understand up to which level",
    "the measurement of the grh would allow to get information on @xmath11 , @xmath13 and @xmath12 , the actual prediction of the grh with the most sophisticated ebl approach has been repeated for a set of different values of these cosmological parameters .    for that , first each one of the parameters",
    "was changed @xmath42 from its best fit value , keeping the rest at their best fit value .",
    "the results are shown in figures [ fig : densities ] and [ fig : hubble ] . in figure [ fig : densities ] , one can see that a @xmath43 variation leads to a change in the grh prediction at high redshift which is of @xmath44 gev for @xmath45 and @xmath46 gev for @xmath13 , while keeping the ghr prediction unchanged at low redshifts as it was expected since for @xmath47 the lookback time curve does not depend on @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : hubble ] shows that a @xmath43 variation on @xmath11 also leads to @xmath35 gev difference at high redshift but there is now also a sizeable difference for low redshifts , in contrast to the behaviour in the previous case .",
    "the hubble constant enters in the optical depth calculation as global factor and therefore its variation produces a global shift of the optical depth .",
    "then , the flatest zone of the optical depth crosses the @xmath23 line at different redshift , which is seen in the grh as a region where the logarithm of the grh energy as a function of the logarithm of the redshift shows a hard slope ( figure  [ fig : hubble ] ) .",
    "therefore the zone close to the hard slope region is very sensitive to @xmath11 , since a 3 @xmath37 variation changes @xmath48 @xmath49 the grh .",
    "the fact that the variations in the grh due to the hubble constant and due to the cosmological densities are qualitatively different leaves some room to disentangle both kind of parameters .",
    "actually , in figure  [ fig : disen ] it can be seen that a @xmath43 difference in each parameter produces a change of around @xmath50 in both cases at large redshift . but",
    "while decreasing redshift the effect due to changing the cosmological densities goes to zero , the effect due to the hubble constant remains at around @xmath51 . therefore the precise determination of the grh for @xmath52 and for @xmath53 will allow to perform independent measurement of both sets of parameters .",
    "in fact , above @xmath53 also the dependence on @xmath13 and @xmath45 is different and therefore , precise measurements may provide a handle to measure both independently .",
    "finally , the sensitivity of the measurement of the grh energy as a function of the redshift @xmath17 on each one of the parameters varied independently while keeping the rest at their best fit value , has been computed and is plotted in figure [ fig : sensitivity ] . in that figure the sensitivity for each parameter @xmath54 is actually defined as    @xmath55    in such a way that for a given uncertainty in the estimation of the grh energy @xmath56 the relative precision in the single - parameter determination of @xmath54 would be    @xmath57    it is clear that the maximal relative sensitivity is for the @xmath58 parameter while for @xmath45 the relative sensitivity is , depending on the @xmath17 region , between one and two orders of magnitude smaller and around a factor 5 even smaller for @xmath13 . in this figure",
    "it is also clear that the sensitivities evolve differently with @xmath17 and therefore , if precision measurements are obtained it should be possible to fit simultaneously the three parameters .",
    "this possibility will be explored in detail in the second part of this work already mentioned at the introduction .      in the calculation",
    "presented above , the assumptions taken are based on our present knowledge of fundamental interactions , astrophysics and cosmology . nevertheless ,",
    "at such high energies and cosmological distances , for instance the effects from physics beyond the `` standard model '' , such as quantum gravity or supersymmetry , could be important .",
    "there are plausible scenarios `` beyond '' the present knowledge which could affect the grh prediction and hence , should be considered . in",
    "the following we would like to comment on our understanding on how these effects , and other effects not considered in our calculations , could change the grh predictions presented above .",
    "so far the only considered absorption mechanism has been the gamma - gamma interaction .",
    "as we have already seen , the gamma - gamma reaction has a strong dependence on the final state fermion mass and we have checked explicitly with our calculation that the contribution coming from standard model fermions other than the electrons adds a negligible absorption .",
    "as far as we know no extension of the standard model provides any alternative light final state particle not excluded already by the present accelerators that could add any significant amount of gamma - gamma absorption .",
    "therefore , no sizable change in the grh prediction can be expected in standard model extensions such a supersymmetry due to modifications in the gamma - gamma cross section .",
    "it is clear that the target for the high energy gammas could also be any other particle filling the intergalactic space .",
    "therefore , it could be neutrinos , visible matter and barionic and non - barionic dark matter . given the expected density for these targets and the present constraints in the dark matter candidates , we are not aware of any absorption mechanism with these targets that could add any sizable absorption contribution to the one of the gamma - gamma reaction for the gamma ray energy range considered in this paper and hence , give any sizable correction to the grh prediction .",
    "high energy gamma rays traversing cosmological distances should notice the quantum fluctuations in the gravitational vacuum which unavoidably should happen in any quantum theory of gravitation .",
    "these fluctuations may occur on scale sizes as small as the planck length @xmath59 cm or time - scales of the order of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 gev ) .",
    "these gammas will therefore experience a `` vacuum polarization '' correction which should be very small ( @xmath62 where @xmath7 is the gamma energy and @xmath63 is an effective scale for quantum gravity , which might be as large as @xmath64 but might become measurable after the gamma has traversed cosmological distances . in this quantum gravity scenario emerges naturally the requirement of local `` violation '' of the lorenz - invariance symmetry @xcite providing as a direct effect an energy - dependent propagation speed for electromagnetic waves .",
    "this local `` violation '' of the lorenz - invariance symmetry changes the threshold condition for the @xmath65 reaction in a way that depends on the quantum gravity model considered and its effective scale @xcite . for plausible models ,",
    "the correction to the grh predictions turns out to be quite important and hence , deserves a detailed discussion , which we presented in reference @xcite .",
    "the gamma - gamma cross section depends strongly on the gamma polarization state .",
    "the calculation made in this paper assumes unpolarized gammas but it might happen that the specific gamma ray source producing the high energy gammas under study produces them with a non - negligible degree of polarization .",
    "if that is the case , the cross section could change in such a way that the grh could differ from the above predictions for that specific source .",
    "similarly , in the whole calculation it has been assumed that the distribution of the ebl was uniform and isotropic at any scale .",
    "given the fact that we consider cosmological distances this assumption is quite plausible .",
    "nevertheless , for any specific gamma ray source , it might happen that the `` local '' ebl density might differ sizably from the `` average '' one and therefore , the grh observed from that source could be sizably different from our prediction .",
    "these aspects and other of similar kind depending on the specific characteristics of the source and its environment should be easy to disentangle from the fundamental predictions if enough sources are observed at each redshift location range .",
    "a complete calculation of the gamma ray horizon ( grh ) in the gamma ray energy range which will be covered by the next generation of gamma ray telescopes has been presented and discussed in detail .",
    "several approaches for the calculation of the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) density ranging in complexity have been compared .",
    "that comparison shows that the uncertainties due to the ebl modeling might be quite large both at low and high redshift . nevertheless , the results for the most realistic approaches agree in predicting that the grh energy at large redshifts is of @xmath66 gev and , hence , should be on the reach of the next generation cherenkov telescopes .",
    "following these predictions , the observable universe should become transparent to gamma rays of below @xmath66 gev and then new , high redshift , high energy gamma ray sources should be observable by the next generation cherenkov telescopes .",
    "gev , well above the asymptotic horizon given by the grh predictions discussed here . given",
    "this fact , to explore the cosmological potential that work does not use a direct measurement of the grh but , instead , the observation of the halo radiation coming from secondary gamma emission in the electromagnetic cascade generated by the absolved primary vhe gammas ]    if these new sources are abundant enough to make possible a precise measurement of the grh energy as a function of the redshift , then either they can be used to place strong constraints in the ebl modeling or as a new technique allowing an independent determination of the cosmological parameters .    exploring deeper this second scenario ,",
    "the actual dependence of the grh predictions on the cosmological parameters has been discussed in detail .",
    "this study shows the potential capability of a precise grh energy determination as a function of the redshift @xmath17 to disentangle the relevant cosmological parameters and provide competitive determinations .",
    "a more quantitative study on the actual experimental possibilities to fit the cosmological parameters with the foreseen observations is presented in the second part of this work .",
