    "poincar symmetry has been a primary geometric notion for the minkowski spacetime ( mst ) and played the guiding role of construction of quantum field theory . at the short distance of planck length scale , however , the spacetime itself may change its concept due to the quantum gravity effect . on this purpose , poincar algebra in momentum space is deformed  @xcite and a new scale parameter @xmath0 is introduced , which will be an order of planck length . the @xmath0-deformed poincar algebra ( kpa )",
    "can have many different forms .",
    "based on bicrossproduct basis  @xcite where the four momenta are commuting each other but the boost relation is deformed , the dual picture of the kpa is realized in terms of non - commuting spacetime  @xcite .",
    "this non - commuting spacetime is called @xmath0-minkowski spacetime ( kmst ) , where the rotational symmetry is preserved but time and space coordinates do not commute each other , @xmath2 = \\frac{i}{\\kappa } \\hat x^i\\,,\\qquad   ~[\\hat x^i , \\hat   x^j]=0\\,,\\qquad i , j=1,2,3\\,.\\ ] ]    the planck scale parameter @xmath0 has the role of a deformation parameter .",
    "when @xmath0 approaches infinity , the deformed poincar algebra in momentum space reduces to the ordinary poincar algebra and therefore , the ordinary poincar symmetry is recovered in minkowski spacetime .",
    "the @xmath0-deformed realization implies that the special relativity is deformed and the energy momentum relation also has a new form .",
    "this will result in a change of the group velocity of photon . in this respect , kpa implies the doubly special relativity  @xcite and the deformation parameter @xmath0 reflect the planck scale physics .",
    "after the appearance of the kpa , it is soon realized that the differential structure of the kmst of 4 spacetime dimension is not realized in 4 dimensional spacetime but needs to be constructed in 5 dimensional spacetime  @xcite .",
    "this reminds of the snyder s approach where non - commutative coordinates are realized in 4 dimensional de sitter space @xcite .",
    "the differential calculus is realized in exponential operator @xmath3 with an appropriate ordering of @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "it is worth to mention that the corresponding derivative is realized in the @xmath19dimensional de sitter space : @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the invariant property of @xmath14 leads one to construct 4-dimensional system without invoking the fifth dimensional tangential direction if one requires physical system to respect the @xmath0-deformed poincar symmetry ( kps ) .",
    "based on this 4-dimensional differential structure , one requires the on - shell condition to be @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the particle mass and constructs the scalar field theory with kps  @xcite .",
    "still , an interacting ( field ) theory needs more elaboration since it is not clear how to construct the many particle states from the right choice of vacuum since the many particle states constructed so far show the non - local nature .",
    "( see for example @xcite and references there in ) .    to understand the physical effects of the @xmath0-deformation ,",
    "one may study black - body radiation  @xcite and casimir energy  @xcite using the mass - shell condition only , which uses essentially the free field theory only .",
    "it turns out that the thermal energy of the blackbody radiation due to the massless mode of the kmst ( @xmath25 in ( [ on - shell ] ) ) reduces to the stephan - boltzmann law ( proportional to @xmath26 ) when @xmath1 limit is taken if one takes care of ordinary modes ( om ) from the mass - shell condition ( [ on - shell ] ) which reduces to the one from einstein s special relativity .    in the asymmetric",
    "ordering , the ordinary massless mode is explicitly given as @xmath27 in fact , the mass - shell condition ( [ on - shell ] ) also allows high momentum mode ( hm ) which exist only when its momentum is greater than @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath28 it is shown in @xcite that the stephan - boltzmann law would be spoiled if the hm were to be included in the thermal distribution , whose contribution turns out to be proportional to @xmath29 or @xmath30 depending on how one treats the negative energy part of hm .",
    "thus , one needs to eliminate the hm from the on - shell .",
    "the same thing applies to the symmetric ordering case .    on the other hand",
    ", the study of casimir energy on a spherical shell shows that in the asymmetric ordering case the vacuum can break particle and anti - particle symmetry at planck scale : the casimir energy of the negative mode ( anti - particle ) in ( [ asym - om ] ) is not the same as the one due to the positive mode ( particle ) if the hm is not included .",
    "thus , if one requires the vacuum to respect the particle and antiparticle symmetry at planck scale , one can not adopt the asymmetric ordering dispersion relation .",
    "this reasoning forces us to adopt the symmetric ordering only to have the particle and anti - particle symmetry at the planck scale .    in this paper",
