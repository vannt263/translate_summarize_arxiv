    "the distribution of large scale structures ( lss ) is one of the most important tools to study our universe . with",
    "the recently concluded and upcoming lss surveys such as boss , desi , euclid , lsst etc .",
    "the vast amount of data will provide enough statistical power that errors in the analysis will be dominated by poor theoretical understanding of lss .",
    "these surveys generally observe tracers such as galaxies , which unlike in weak lensing studies , do not perfectly trace the underlying matter density .",
    "making this connection is a two step process- to realize that galaxies reside in collapsed dark matter halos following some statistical distribution- and that these halos themselves are biased tracers of matter distribution . in this paper , we focus on the latter of these and study novel techniques to measure halo bias .",
    "for a recent review on galaxy bias see @xcite .    in full generality",
    "the relation between the halo density field and the dark matter contains information about all processes relevant for the formation of halos , as well as stochastic contributions arising due to the fact that halos come in a finite number .",
    "however on large enough scales , we can hope to treat the problem perturbatively , and characterize the bias relation with a relatively small number of free parameters we can marginalize over .",
    "the simplest way to get physical intuition of halo bias comes from the so - called peak - background split argument ( pbs ) @xcite . in the original formulation of pbs , halos are regions where the value of the dark matter density field exceeds some critical threshold . this threshold can be crossed more easily in presence of a positive large scale dark matter fluctuations , and conversely less easily for a negative one .",
    "this means that , on average , overdense regions host more halos than the mean .",
    "linear bias , @xmath1 , can therefore be defined as the linear response of the halo overdensity field , @xmath2 , to the presence of long wavelength perturbations , @xmath3 _ h = b_1 _ m the above relation can be generalized to any order in the density field , leading to the well known result by @xcite , [ eq : frygatz ] 1+_h(x ) = _ n = 0^_m^n(x ) , where however one must also enforce integral constraint by imposing that @xmath4 .",
    "typically the bias expansion is written in two ways : either by relating the the halo field to the dark matter field at time the observations are made , at low redshift , or by identifying in the initial gaussian field regions which are more likely to collapse into halos at a later time .",
    "the former is called a eulerian bias approach , the latter a lagrangian bias approach .",
    "white the two approaches can be shown to be mathematically equivalent , each method has its own pros and cons .",
    "it has been recently shown that the statistics of the halos does not only depend on the dark matter density field , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : frygatz ] ) , but also on spatial derivatives of the density field,@xcite and on the tidal fields , each of which with its own new bias coefficient",
    ". these new terms , with abuse of notation , have been called non local bias coefficients , since they contain gradients of the the density field or of the gravitational potential .",
    "they have been shown to be important in the eulerian approach , as they can be generated by non linear gravitational evolution , and can actually be predicted in perturbation theory ( pt ) . as a matter of fact",
    "a complete basis would include all possible fields one can construct at any given order in perturbation theory compatible with the symmetry of the problem @xcite .",
    "the relevance of non local terms in the lagrangian approach is still under debate . at the linear level",
    ", a scale dependent bias term is certainly present , as shown for instance in @xcite , using n - body simulations , and its measured value agrees fairly well with analytical models of structure formation @xcite . at second order",
    "the leading non local term is proportional to the traceless shear @xmath5 , also called tidal field , defined as [ eq : s2 ] s^2 ( ) _ ij s^2_ij ( ) s^2_ij ( ) = ( - _ ij^k ) ( ) , this new term has been measured in eulerian space by @xcite , and it is nowadays included in all analysis of galaxy redshift surveys @xcite . as we have already mentioned , a non - zero tidal bias is expected from non - linear gravitational evolution .",
    "it is therefore important to compare the values measured in n - body simulations to the assumptions of zero lagrangian tidal bias , since an incorrect assumption on the latter could affect the determination of cosmological parameters .",
    "tidal bias in the lagrangian picture is non - zero if the shear is sampled around proto - halos differently than around random positions .",
    "we actually do expect the shear to play an important role in the process of halo collapse , that is very likely to happen in an ellipsoidal fashion @xcite .",
    "the work in @xcite have not shown clear evidence for tidal bias in lagrangian space using n - body simulations .",
    "it is therefore interesting , and it is one of our main goals , to check whether this bias coefficient has non - zero value in a lagrangian scheme and what would be the implications .",
    "in addition to finding evidence of new bias coefficients , there is also another good reason to study lagrangian halo bias . in lagrangian space",
    "it is more natural to write down relation among the different parameters , since , contrary to the eulerian picture , non - linear evolution and the biasing scheme are decoupled from each other . for similar reasons ,",
    "the evolution of bias with redshift , an important issue for galaxy surveys that spans a wide redshift range , is better understood in lagrangian space .",
    "finally , analytic approaches to predict the value of bias coefficients are built in the lagrangian formalism , and can be used to put priors on some of the bias parameters .",
    "as we are ultimately interested in cosmological analysis of lls data , a combination of priors and relations between the bias coefficients would be of great help to narrow the error bars on cosmological parameters .",
    "recently @xcite have shown that at 1-loop in lagrangian effective perturbation theory , the measurements in redshift space of the halo multipoles are very well described if one adopts the following bias expansion ,    @xmath6 + b_{s^2}[s^2(\\bx ) - \\langle s^2(\\bx ) \\rangle]\\;,\\ ] ]    stopping at second order and assuming that third order terms are only generated by gravitational evolution .",
    "our goal is to estimate the three bias coefficients in the above equation in n - body simulations using different techniques , and to compare them to analytic predictions .",
    "we are primarily interested in scale dependent bias , linear and non linear , and in the first clear evidence of tidal shear in the bias expansions .",
    "we will make use of three different estimators : cross correlations in fourier space , cross correlations in real space , and direct implementation of the pbs argument to simulations .",
    "we organize the paper as follows . in section [ sec : bf ]",
    "we describe our approach to estimate bias using cross power spectra in fourier space , showing results for the bias coefficients up to second order . in section [ sec : breal ] , estimators in real space that make use of the pdf of the density field are discussed , in particular focusing on their agreement with the fourier space measurements . in section [ sec :",
    "bpbs ] we present a direct application of pbs to simulations that allows to recover the value of the scale independent part of the bias coefficients .",
    "after establishing the agreement between different estimators , in section [ sec : rel ] , we present various relations amongst different parameters .",
    "section [ sec : stoch ] deals with the halo - bias stochasticity , and how much it is reduced by introducing a more complicated bias model .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclude ] summarizes the main results , drawing conclusions and future prospects .",
    "since we work in lagrangian space , throughout the text what we will refer to a dark matter halo as the initial collection of particles in the n - body simulations which a halo is made of at the final redshift , @xmath7 let s say , the proto - halo .",
    "the simulations we used for the analysis have been produced using the fastpm code @xcite .",
    "fastpm is a tool to generate non linear dark matter and halo fields in a quick way , employing a number of approximations to reproduce the results of full n - body simulation . despite its approximate nature , in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the code performs extremely well on various benchamarks such as dark matter power spectrum , the halo mass function and halo power spectrum .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite for more details of the tests performed .",
    "we evolved @xmath8 particles in periodic cubic boxes of size 690 , 1380 and 3000 @xmath9 .",
    "the mass of the particle in three cases is @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the linear power spectrum used was generated with camb with cosmology @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and the initial particle displacement and velocity were computed at 2nd order in lagrangian perturbation theory .",
    "the halos were identified using fof halo finder in nbodykit with the optimization presented in @xcite using a linking length of 0.2 .",
    "the smallest halo identified in every simulation consists of a 100 particles .",
    "we ran 5 independent realizations for every box and all the results presented are average of these runs . unless stated otherwise , we show results at a single redshift , @xmath7 . + to calculate power spectra ,",
    "we interpolate the halos on @xmath17 grid using cloud - in - cell ( cic ) interpolation and deconvolved the cic window . to keep the comparison consistent , we used a @xmath17 grid for dark matter density field as well and sampled the corresponding 512 modes from the 2048 modes available from the simulations .",
    "* : we show @xmath1 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 as measured from fourier space estimator .",
    "the dashed , solid and dot - dashed lines are from different boxes of size , @xmath20 , respectively . for clarity , we have refrained from showing all the mass - bins .",
    "the dependence on the wavenumber is the shared by all the parameters : constant piece on large scales followed by @xmath21-like piece on intermediate scales followed by a cutoff around the halo scale . ]",
    "the easiest thing to measure in fourier space is linear bias , b_1 = where in our notation the power spectrum between the @xmath22 and @xmath23 field reads @xmath24 . in figure",
    "[ fig : bias - kgrid ] , top panel , we show linear bias as measured from our fastpm runs for several halo mass bins .",
    "the common features shared by all the halos are : a constant piece on large scales , and then a @xmath21-like piece on intermediate scales followed by a cut off , approximately at the scale of the halo .",
    "similar plots for linear bias can be found for instance in @xcite .",
    "a convenient parametrization of linear bias is therefore @xcite [ eq : b1k ] b_1(k ) = ( b_10 + 2 b_11)w(k r ) where @xmath25 is the variance of the linear field smoothed on the scale of the halo @xmath26 , @xmath27 .",
    "for instance , for a gaussian windows , @xmath28 , the scale dependent term @xmath29 is exactly proportional to @xmath21 . in this form",
    "the two bias coefficients @xmath30 and @xmath29 are both dimensionless .",
    "since neither the halo scale , @xmath26 , nor the average halo shape , @xmath31 , are known , fitting the above equation to the simulations results requires some care . to be conservative , and for comparison with previous work , we assume proto - halos of mass @xmath32 are spherical patches of size @xmath33 , such that the window function @xmath31 is top - hat of radius @xmath26 in real space . as a further safeguard ,",
    "we fit for @xmath34 only upto the first peak near the halo scale , after which the halo window function starts to dominate over the scale dependence of bias .. crosses zero at large @xmath35 excludes the gaussian window , @xmath36 , employed by @xcite .",
    "the choice of the filter is almost irrelevant for the best - fit value of @xmath30 .",
    "] at this time we can fit for the scale independent piece of linear bias , @xmath30 , as well as for the scale dependent one , @xmath29 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b1k ] ) . a comparison of @xmath30 with theoretical models and with other estimators for linear bias on large scales will be done in the next section , whereas here we only show , in figure [ fig - b11_mass ] , results for @xmath29 as a function of mass and how it compares to the analytic prediction shown as the continuous line .",
    "the model we use is an extension of peaks theory ( bbks)(@xcite ) that includes the excursion set constraints ( esp ) @xcite and a simple treatment of ellipsoidal collapse ( @xmath37 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath37 model reproduces reasonably well the halo mass function and linear and quadratic bias halo bias on large scale as measured from n - body simulations , see @xcite for more details .",
    "it has one free parameter , @xmath38 , entering the definition of the critical threshold , @xmath39 , required for collapse , which measures the relative importance of shear fluctuations to density fluctuations at the halo scale [ eq : esptau ] b = _ c + where @xmath40 is the standard spherical collapse value .",
    "we fit @xmath38 by eye to the measurements , finding that @xmath41 provides a good fit to the data .",
    "@xmath37 performs remarkably , if not surprisingly , well in comparison to the scale dependent piece over a @xmath42 orders of magnitude in mass . since the value of scale dependent bias is sensitive to the choice of the filter ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : b1k ] ) ) , the agreement between the theory and the data suggests that defining proto - halos with a top - hat filter is a very good approximation .",
    "this finding is in contradiction with @xcite , and it deserves future investigation in a future work . as we will see later in section [ sec : rel ] the performance of @xmath37 on scale dependent bias is important , as the value of @xmath30 and @xmath29 are related by mass conservation .",
    "we would like to extend the results we have shown for @xmath1 to higher order bias coefficients , in particular we seek for a simple estimator of @xmath19 .",
    "first , notice that , since the bias relation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : real - bias ] ) is written in real space , any estimators of second order bias coefficients in fourier space will make use of convolutions , for instance the squared density field is trivially ^2(x ) = e^ - i ^3q ( q)(k - q ) and an analogous expression holds for @xmath5 .",
    "we also remind that since the dark matter field is linear in lagrangian space , cross correlations between the halos and a generic quadratic fields are very easy to write down , as any expectation value involving three fields vanishes . within the model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : real - bias ] ) we arrive to @xmath43 where for instance p_^2 ^2(k ) = k^3 _ r = 0^ _ x=-1 ^ 1 p(kr)p(k ) and similar expression involving legendre polynomials can be written for @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "+ the linear system of equations in eq .",
    "( [ eq : b2k - bs2k ] ) can be solved to obtain a value of @xmath18 and @xmath19 at each mode @xmath35 and for different halo populations .",
    "( to assist in solving , one can also re - write these equations in terms of @xmath46 to decouple @xmath5 from @xmath47 , though it is not necessary . )",
    "the solution is shown in the two bottom panels of figure  [ fig : bias - kgrid ] , which makes clear that the behavior as a function of @xmath35 we have seen for linear bias also applies to higher order bias coefficients .",
    "scale dependence of non linear bias would have , for instance , to be taken into account for lagrangian perturbation theory calculations beyond @xmath48-loop order .",
    "the bottom panel clearly shows that tidal bias is non zero for a variety of halo populations .",
    "this has important consequences for cosmological analyses using lagrangian perturbation theory plus lagrangian bias ( @xcite ) .",
    "as already known , @xmath18 is negative for low mass halos and then becomes large and positive for very massive halos .",
    "the opposite trend is observed for @xmath19 , which is negative at the high mass end .",
    "this is expected , since shear is acting against the formation of the halos , whereas density enhances it .",
    "had we started with a local bias expansion we would have gotten different results for @xmath49 , in contradiction with the results of the next sections , and as further discussion at the end of section [ sec : breal ] .    while we do find evidence for non - zero tidal bias , getting the precise values for various mass bins is non - trivial .",
    "this is due to the combined effect of cosmic variance as well as degeneracy between @xmath47 and @xmath5 on large scales , making things noisy on very large scales where the scale independent piece of bias should dominate , and it becomes more severe for our smallest simulation box .",
    "this also comes into play when we try to extend this method to @xmath50 ( see appendix [ sec : appendix - a ] ) .",
    "furthermore , unlike @xmath1 , the functional form of the scale dependence of @xmath19 is highly non - trivial @xcite , and hence much more sensitive to the halo window , which is not exactly known , as well as @xmath51 , up to which any such a fit is done . nevertheless , for the purpose of this work , we strive to fit for a constant on large scales as function of increasing @xmath51 and choose the value which gives the best reduced @xmath52 of the fit .     as a function of mass : * the values are estimated from the best fit values for @xmath53 and using eq .",

    "cross correlations between the halos and other fields can also be written in real space .",
    "the advantage of working in lagrangian space is that we know the pdf of the density field , and therefore estimators for the cross correlation and for the bias coefficients can be written down without expensive pair counting .",
    "following @xcite , if @xmath55 is the dark matter density in a sphere of radius @xmath56 around halos of given mass @xmath32 , for the @xmath57-th order bias coefficient we can write [ eq : bn - real ] _",
    "n = _ i=1^n h_n ( ) where the sum runs over all the @xmath58 halos falling into the mass bin , and @xmath59 is a probabilist s hermite polynomial .",

    "the agreement between the two is very good over the whole mass range we probe and it is very well described by @xmath37 .",
    "it is important to point out what would have happened if we had not include shear in our bias estimator in fourier space .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ fig - b2nos2 ] , in which the estimates of @xmath18 in fourier space without taking shear into account are clearly incompatible with the real space results ( and with the theoretical model ) .",
    "we conclude the discussion of real space bias measurements by generalizing the estimator in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bn - real ] ) to non local bias parameters .",
    "it is easy to show that the shear field , @xmath5 , is @xmath52-distributed with five degrees of freedom @xcite , which implies that the orthogonal polynomials to use in the estimator are laguerre polynomials , @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 is the large scale ( @xmath56 ) shear .",

    "this technique , known as separate universe , allows to measure isotropic bias parameters in n - body simulations with basically no cosmic variance @xcite .",
    "the drawback of this method is that it does not apply to tidal bias , where one would need n - body simulations with anisotropic expansion along the different axis , since the introduction of shear breaks isotropy of space .        in lagrangian space , where the density field is linear , one can take advantage of the pbs to measure _ any _ bias parameters in a much simpler way .",

    "since the @xmath21 term in linear bias , @xmath29 , is highly degenerate with the leading order counter term @xmath91 , in the effective field theory ( eft ) of lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite , one could argue that it should be possible to just fit for @xmath29 in a eft approach , and then use the consistency relation to put a prior on the value of scale dependent bias .",
    "similar relation should hold between higher order bias parameters and higher moments of the density field at the halo scale .      in the study of halo abundances and clustering",
    ", universality means that the halo mass function and halo bias are unambiguously determined by a single function of cosmology and redshift , the variance of the linear density field , @xmath92 .",
    "the existence of universal relations is important , since it means we have a proxy for how the bias of a population of halos evolves , for instance , with redshift .",
    "violations of the universality of the mass function in n - body simulations with redshift have been reported in @xcite , while the eulerian linear bias remains a universal function @xcite the purpose of this section is to test universality of linear and non linear local bias , as well as the novel @xmath93 , with redshift .",
    "the best way to test universality is to plot quantities estimated at different redshift as function of the peak height @xmath94 .     and",
    "green points are @xmath95 .",
    "fourier space points are for all three boxes while pbs measurements are only for @xmath85 box .",
    "the analytic prediction is assumed to be redshift independent . ]",
    "we carried out the analysis of the previous sections at @xmath95 , and a test of universality of bias is reported in figure  [ fig - universal ] .",
    "the values of @xmath1 and @xmath18 , in blue at @xmath7 and in green at @xmath95 in the top panel , align very nicely as a function of @xmath96 over all the mass range probed by our simulations . for tidal bias",
    ", the pbs measurements do show that the bias is approximately universal , whereas the fourier space measurements show some disagreement for large mass halos . while this can possibly be due to poor fits , as discussed in section [ sec : bf ] , on the other hand , in the @xmath97 model , the amplitude of the tidal bias is mainly set by the parameter @xmath38 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : esptau ] ) , which a priori could have arbitrary redshift dependence .",
    "the continuous line is the same @xmath37 theory , for which we assume that @xmath38 does not depend on redshift . a detailed study of the importance of the shear for halo formation as a function of redshift goes beyond the scope of this work , and we intend to come back to this issue in the future .",
    "another way to restrict the dimensionality of the bias parameters space is to find relations between linear bias and higher order bias parameters .",
    "while such relations can be determined at each redshift , if the bias parameters are universal , then one could just fit for @xmath98 and @xmath99 . in an eulerian framework",
    "this has been discussed a lot in the literature , see recent work by @xcite .",
    "however it is important to realize that if such relations exist , they do because they hold in lagrangian space .",
    "we must also stress another word of caution : the nature of these relations is empirical , not fundamental , and it is , for instance , violated by assembly bias effects .",
    "figure [ fig - relation ] shows @xmath18 as a function of @xmath1 , upper panel , and @xmath19 as a function of @xmath1 , lower panel .",
    "since the pbs estimates of tidal bias are universal , we show the relations only for these data .",
    "the measured values smoothly align , indicating that the relation could be fitted by some simple functional form .",
    "as expected from results in the previous sections , the theory is able to predict very well the relation between non linear and linear bias , but it is not as accurate for the tidal bias .",
    "we want now to go back to the relation between lagrangian and eulerian bias parameters as discussed in the introduction .",
    "if @xmath19 was zero , gravitational evolution makes a unique prediction for the eulerian tidal bias , @xmath100 , @xcite b_s^2^e = -b_1 = -(b_1^e-1 ) [ eq - shear_coev ] where we have used the well known relation @xmath101 .",
    "as we have measured a non - zero shear bias in lagrangian space , the above equation needs to be modified @xcite , @xmath102 figure [ fig - bs2eul ] shows the relation between linear and tidal bias in eulerian space , using the measurement from the pbs method .",
    "the assumption of no lagrangian shear bias , black line , is far from the measurements at both low and high value of @xmath103 .",
    "thus , in the presence of this lagrangian shear bias , using the relation of eq .",
    "( [ eq - shear_coev ] ) such as done in analysis of @xcite can lead to possible systematic errors in the analysis . since the analytic model does not yield an accurate fit to the data , for practical purposes we provide a numerical fit to the pbs measurements : @xmath104     ( upper panel ) and @xmath105 ( lower panel ) shown only for pbs estimator since tidal bias is most universal for these .",

    "( [ eq - shear_coev ] ) ; solid black line ) the presence of lagrangian shear bias as measured by pbs estimator . the numerical best fit ( eq .  ( [ eq : bs2_fit ] ) ) to the measurement points is in dashed blue . ]",
    "following @xcite , for any two fields @xmath22 and @xmath23 , where the field @xmath23 is supposed to model field @xmath22 , we measure the error in modeling in terms of the stochasticity , @xmath106 , defined as @xmath107 for our purpose here , we are interested in examining how well we reconstruct the halo field with the estimated bias parameters .",
    "thus @xmath108 is the halo power spectrum ( @xmath109 ) , while @xmath110 is the auto - power spectra for the biased field ( @xmath111 ) .",
    "the explicit expression in terms of bias parameters is @xmath112 if the bias - field reconstructs the halo field perfectly , all the three power spectra in the definition of stochasticity should be the same resulting in @xmath113 .",
    "however since the number of halos , @xmath114 , is finite , the halo auto spectrum contains poisson shot noise , @xmath115 ( where @xmath72 is the box size ) , which is not captured by the continuous bias field .    in figure  [ fig - stochasticity ] , we show measurement of stochasticity in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stoch ] ) for three different mass bins , one from each of the three simulation boxes . for each mass",
    ", we show how the stochasticity changes as we include higher order bias parameters over simple linear bias @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : power_stoch ] ) . to make this figure , we again averaged over the stochasticity of 5 simulations for a given size and for each simulation , and we used the same mean value , across the realisations , of the bias coefficients , which in this case was the constant ( large scale ) fourier space bias .",
    "overall , on large scales , the stochasticity is close to its poisson shot noise value for intermediate and low mass bin , while its somewhat lower for heavier halos ( @xcite explains this as exclusion effects ) .",
    "however , especially for the low mass halos , simply using the linear bias for halo field does leave significant scale dependence in the stochasticity which is improved upon by including higher order bias parameters ( upper panel ) .",
    "this is useful since this residual can still be modeled with a scalar , if not necessarily poisson , shot noise . in addition , including @xmath18 and especially @xmath19 does assist in reducing stochasticity further over linear bias models ( lower panel ) .    ) .",
    "the solid lines , dashed and dotted lines respectively correspond to measurements on successively including @xmath1 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : power_stoch ] ) . for comparison , the black lines are shot noise for that mass bin .",
    "the lower panel shows the ratio of dashed and dotted lines of upper panel with the solid lines to emphasize that more complex bias models reduce stochasticity . ]",
    "understanding the relation between the galaxy or halo field and the underlying dark matter distribution , is crucial in order to extract cosmological information from the lss .    in this paper",
    "we have focused our attention to halo bias defined in lagrangian space .",
    "we employed three different estimators of bias parameters- fourier space correlations , real space correlations and pbs estimator .",
    "the three approaches are quite different and thus sensitive to different systematic effects , nevertheless their agreement in terms of best - fit bias parameters as a function of halos mass is quite remarkable ( figure [ fig - sep_univ_b1 m ] ) .",
    "we have shown a convincing evidence for shear bias in lagrangian space with all three methods ( figures [ fig : bias - kgrid ] , [ fig - b1 m ] and [ fig - sep_univ_b1 m ] ) . indeed , including the tidal bias was crucial to obtain the consensus of quadratic local bias of all the three estimators ( figure [ fig - b2nos2 ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the model presented in @xcite is able to predict well @xmath1 and @xmath18 , but it misses a good description of tidal bias .",
    "the fourier space estimator have also enabled us to present the scale dependence of quadratic and shear bias ( figure [ fig : bias - kgrid ] ) , and to show that it is similar to the one of linear bias . for linear bias ,",
    "the fourier space method allowed us to check that the scale dependent piece ( figure [ fig - b11_mass ] ) is very well predicted by theory .",
    "this has implications for the problem of what is the right window to use when defining halos in lagrangian space .",
    "we also successfully demonstrated , in n - body simulations , the validity of a consistency relation for linear bias coefficients , [ eq : consrel ] and figure  [ fig - consistency ] , that are fundamental to the bias parameters .",
    "this opens the door to reduce the number of independent bias parameters .",
    "we have then used the pbs argument to generalize previous results on bias with respect to density , to the case of bias with respect to the shear field .",
    "we were therefore able to measure non - local bias as the response of the halo number density to the presence of long wavelength tidal field ( figure [ fig - sep_univ_boxlets ] ) . in the appendix",
    "[ sec : appendix - a ] , we also show that this method can be extended to third order bias parameter @xmath50 ( figure [ fig - sep_univ_b3 ] ) .",
    "however care needs to be taken while choosing the size of boxlets due to the dichotomy between better constraining power for small boxlets but at the possible cost of residual scale dependence and non - poissonian shot noise .",
    "relations among linear bias and quadratic bias parameters have also been discussed , with the general finding that those relations exist and can be easily fitted for ( figure [ fig - relation ] ) . along",
    "the way we also showed that all these bias parameters are to a very good approximation a universal function of redshift ( figure [ fig - universal ] ) .",
    "we note that while the evidence of non - zero tidal bias seems convincing and there is general agreement between different estimators , fourier space shear estimates make larger excursions above zero than real space or pbs estimates ( figure [ fig - sep_univ_b1 m ] ) , and also seem to exhibit some violations of universality for high mass halos .",
    "while there is no a priori reason to expect density and shear bias coefficients to exhibit the same level of universality , we discussed in section [ sec : bf ] whereas the possible reason could be poor fits due to lack of correct halo window as well as complicated scale dependence of tidal bias , coupled with degeneracy of @xmath47 and @xmath5 on very large scales .",
    "this is an important point which we wish to investigate in future work , with better measurements .",
    "as we have shown , the analytic model in @xcite is not capable to reproduce our measurements of the tidal bias , figure [ fig - bs2eul ] , therefore we provide a numerical fit to the relation between the eulerian linear bias , @xmath103 , and the eulerian shear bias , @xmath100 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bs2_fit ] ) .",
    "finally , we discuss the stochasticity of the halo field and find that including more complex bias models over simple linear bias does seem to reduce stochasticity , especially its scale dependence ( figure  [ fig - stochasticity ] ) .",
    "this makes these models worth studying since a scale independent stochasticity can be parameterized with a constant shot noise which can be marginalized over in the analysis .",
    "ec would like to thank ravi sheth , aseem paranjape and martin white for useful discussions .",
    "this work is supported by nasa grant nnx15al17 g .",
    "in principle , we should be able to extend the above estimates to higher order bias parameters . in this appendix ,",
    "we provide details on our attempts to do so . for the real space estimates ,",
    "this involves calculating the mean of third hermite polynomial at the position of the halos , which is straightforward .",
    "our attempts to extend the fourier space estimate return very noisy estimates for @xmath50 on large scales .",
    "this is due to @xmath116 as well as @xmath117 being degenerate on large scales .",
    "+      in the pbs case however , we can simply fit for following equation : @xmath118 the results for various estimates are show in figure [ fig - sep_univ_b3 ] , where we are showing the real space results only from @xmath85 , to compare them with their separate universe counterparts .",
