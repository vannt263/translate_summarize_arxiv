    "a famous example of a mildly mixing but not mixing system is the well  known chacon transformation @xmath5 ( mild mixing of @xmath5 follows directly from the minimal self - joining property of @xmath5 , @xcite ) .",

    "in fact , from the spectral point of view special flows in this paper have no spectral measure which is rajchman , i.e.  they are spectrally disjoint from mixing flows ( see @xcite ) .    the aim of this paper is to show that the class of special flows built from a piecewise absolutely continuous function @xmath11 with a non  zero sum of jumps and over a rotation by @xmath0 with bounded partial quotients is mildly mixing ( theorem  [ twmmsf ] )",
