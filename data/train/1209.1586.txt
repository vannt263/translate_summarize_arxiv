    "the higgs boson is a crucial element of the standard model ( sm ) of elementary particles and interactions . within the sm ,",
    "vector boson masses arise from the spontaneous breaking of electroweak symmetry due to the existence of the higgs particle .",
    "the winter results from the lhc and the tevatron experiments have excluded wide regions of the possible higgs mass ranges .",
    "the most interesting region to search for the higgs is the mass range between 115 and 127 gev/@xmath5 where the both the atlas and the cms experiments have found some excesses  @xcite . the tevatron experiments can contribute to the understanding of this region by analyzing the data collected through the years of 2001 - 2011 .",
    "the sm higgs boson @xmath6 is predicted to be produced in association with a @xmath7 or @xmath8 boson at the fermilab tevatron @xmath9 collider and its dominant decay mode is predicted to be into a bottom - antibottom quark pair ( @xmath10 ) , if its mass @xmath11 is less than 135  gev/@xmath5  ( low higgs mass region ) .",
    "the searches use the complete tevatron data sample of @xmath9 collisions at a center of mass energy of 1.96 tev collected by the cdf and d0 detectors at the fermilab tevatron , with an integrated luminosity of 9.45 fb@xmath1    9.7  fb@xmath1 .",
    "the cdf and d0 detectors are multipurpose solenoidal spectrometers surrounded by hermetic calorimeters and muon detectors and are designed to study the products of 1.96 tev proton - antiproton collisions  @xcite .",
    "the online event selections ( triggers ) rely on fast reconstruction of combinations of high-@xmath12 lepton candidates , jets , and @xmath13 .",
    "event selections are similar in the cdf and d0 analyses , consisting typically of a preselection based on event topology and kinematics , and a subsequent selection using @xmath14-tagging .",
    "each channel is divided into exclusive sub - channels according to various lepton , jet multiplicity , and @xmath14-tagging characterization criteria aimed at grouping events with similar signal - to - background ratio and so optimize the overall sensitivity .    due to the importance of @xmath14-tagging",
    ", both collaborations have developed multivariate approaches to maximize the performance of the @xmath14-tagging algorithms .",
    "a boosted decision tree algorithm is used in the d0 analysis , which builds and improves upon the previous neural network @xmath14-tagger  @xcite , giving an identification efficiency of @xmath15 for @xmath14 jets with a mis - identification rate of @xmath16 .",
    "the cdf @xmath14-tagging algorithm has been recently augmented with an mva  @xcite , providing a @xmath14-tagging efficiency of @xmath17% and a mis - identification rate of @xmath18% .    in @xmath3 final states ,",
    "the single most sensitive observable to distinguish between the higgs signal and various types of background is the invariant mass of dijet system , @xmath19 , which approximately accounts for 75% of analysis sensitivity . in all low mass higgs searches at tevatron ,",
    "we include additional variables through the multivariate analysis techniques .",
    "dedicated studies have been performed to improve the search sensitivity through the improvements in dijet mass resolution , lepton identification algorithm , @xmath14-tagging , multijet background suppression and modeling , final discriminant optimization .",
    "the detailed information on low mass higgs channels is present in ref .",
    "@xcite    to validate our background modeling and search methods , we perform a search for sm diboson production in the same final states used for the sm @xmath3 searches .",
    "the data sample , reconstruction , process modeling , uncertainties , and sub - channel divisions are identical to those of the sm higgs boson search .",
    "the measured cross section for @xmath20 and @xmath21 production is  @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with sm prediction of @xmath22  pb  @xcite and corresponds to a significance of  standard deviations above the background - only hypothesis .      even though @xmath3 final states are the most sensitive channels at the tevatron below 135 gev / c@xmath23 , in the final combination we consider all the complimentary channels to improve the higgs search sensitivity .",
    "the complete list of channels that goes into the higgs tevatron combination is given in ref .",
    "one of the channels that needs to be mentioned is @xmath4 .",
    "being the most sensitive channel for the high mass higgs region , it has significant contribution to the low mass region as well . for the @xmath4 analyses ,",
    "signal events are characterized by large @xmath13 and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents the accurate reconstruction of the candidate higgs boson mass .",
    "the most sensitive variable for higgs signal is the opening angle , @xmath24 , between the outgoing leptons .",
    "both cdf and d0 include additional event properties and their correlations through multi variate algorithms .",
    "cdf uses neural network outputs , including likelihoods constructed from calculated matrix element probabilities and d0 uses boosted decision trees outputs .",
    "in the tevatron combination , we combine all the major low mass higgs channels with the complimentary final state searches from cdf and d0 . in this section",
    "we report the results presented at cipanp conference , which are based on analyses presented for the winter conferences and described in more detailes in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to determine the estimates of the interest like the upper limits on sm higgs production at 95% c.l . and to gain confidence that the final result does not depend on the details of the statistical formulation , we perform two types of combinations : bayesian approach where the nuisance parameters are integrated out to determine posterior probabilities ; and modified frequentist approach where the minimum of the likelihood is used to determine the nuisance parameters . both approaches yield limits on the higgs boson production rate that agree within 10% at each value of @xmath11 , and within 1% on average .",
    "systematic uncertainties enter on the predicted number of signal and background events as well as on the distribution of the discriminants in each analysis ( `` shape uncertainties '' ) .    the 95% c.l .",
    "limits on higgs production are shown in fig .",

    "the observed @xmath30-value as a function of @xmath11 exhibits a broad minimum , and the maximum local significance corresponds to 2.7 standard deviations at @xmath31  gev/@xmath5 . correcting for the look - elsewhere effect ( lee ) , which accounts for the possibility of a background fluctuation affecting the local @xmath30-value anywhere in the search region , yields a global significance of 2.2 standard deviations .     final tevatron combination for the winter conferences : ( left ) the observed 95% credibility level upper limits on sm higgs boson production as a function of higgs boson mass .",
