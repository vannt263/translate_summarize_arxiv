    "the interaction between a spectrally structured field - continuum and a two - level system ( tls ) , which can be `` dressed by coupling to near - resonant field modes , defines a class of fundamentally important processes in quantum field theories , encompassing quantum electrodynamics @xcite and collective excitations in condensed media @xcite .",
    "a diversity of peculiar features in the tls and field dynamics has been shown @xcite to arise when a bare or dressed tls resonance is close to the continuum edge of the field spectrum .",
    "these features stem from the strong coupling between the tls and a continuum of field modes with an abrupt ( or nearly abrupt ) cut - off and the resulting oscillatory _ non - markovian _ character of decay into the continuum .",
    "perhaps the most spectacular feature is the possibility of forming a _ discrete `` dressed '' state _ , whose energy lies outside the continuum , in the forbidden bandgap , and is stable against decay @xcite .",
    "the excited tls then evolves into a superposition of a discrete , stable state with energy in the forbidden bandgap and a decaying excited - state component with energy in the continuum .",
    "the latter effect should be manifest in various systems : ( i )  the partial inhibition of radiative decay in photonic crystals @xcite and high-@xmath0 cavities @xcite ; ( ii )  the stabilization of a local vibrational mode against decay near the debye cut - off of the phonon spectrum in a solid @xcite ; an ion trap @xcite or an optical lattice @xcite , or ( iii )  the stabilization of an electronic state against auto - ionization @xcite",
    ". it can be interpreted as an ' ' anomalous lamb shift \" @xcite of the discrete , excited , level by the emitted quantum that pushes the level beyond cut - off , or as interference of the emitted quantum with its backscattered amplitude that localizes ( binds ) the excitation to the tls .",
    "the present paper is dedicated to the challenge of coherent , dynamical , control of decay and decoherence in a tls ( a qubit ) whose resonance frequency is close to a continuum edge of a reservoir , allowing for the possibility of strong coupling between the tls and the reservoir .",
    "we raise the question : how can decoherence control benefit from the discrete , stable state of the excited tls in the forbidden bandgap ?",
    "spontaneous emission ( se ) of quanta ( _ e.g. _ , phonons or photons ) into the continuum of the reservoir is the dominant source of decoherence at low temperatures , as the occupancy of the reservoir modes becomes weak @xcite .",
    "a promising means of protection from se is to have the tls resonance frequency well within the bandgap : for example , to embed the atoms in photonic crystals ( three - dimensionally periodic dielectric structures ) so as to block atomic se at frequencies within the spectrally - wide , omnidirectional photonic bandgaps ( pbgs ) @xcite .",
    "highly localized electronic or vibronic states decoupled from their continua would be similarly immune to se of their respective quanta . yet",
    "qubit manipulations for quantum information processing may necessitate tls transition frequencies near the edge of the continuum , where se is only _ partially _ blocked @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to coherently manipulate an atomic transition in the pbg via a single - photon ( rather than two - photon ) transition , one must take advantage of its proximity to the edge frequency and couple it to a field mode in the continuum or to a mode in the pbg created by a local defect in the photonic crystal @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]-inset ) .",
    "similar considerations apply to qubits that must be intermittently coupled to vibrational continua , _",
    "e.g. _ , trapped ions @xcite , or atoms in optical lattices @xcite . + in order to operate quantum logic gates , based on pairwise _ entanglement _ of qubits , say by resonant dipole - dipole interactions @xcite , or by resonant exchange of a phonon in an ion - trap @xcite or of an electron between quantum dots @xcite one should be able to switch the interaction on- and off- , _ e.g. _ , by ac stark - shifts of the transition frequency of one qubit relative to the other . in structured continua",
    ", this would significantly change the detuning of the resonance frequency from the continuum edge , and thereby the degree of se blocking .",
    "the question then arises : should such frequency shifts be performed adiabatically ?",
    "the answer is expected to be affirmative , based on existing treatments of adiabatic entanglement and protection from decoherence @xcite and on the tendency of nonadiabatic evolution to _ spoil the gate fidelity _ and promote transitions to the continuum @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the present analysis demonstrates that an appropriate sequence of _ `` sudden '' _ ( strongly nonadiabatic ) changes of the detuning from the continuum edge may yield _ higher fidelity _ of qubit and quantum gate operations than their adiabatic counterparts .",
    "this unconventional nonadiabatic protection from decoherence can be attributed to the ability of appropriately alternating detunings from the continuum edge in the strong - coupling regime to _ augment the interference _ of the emitted and back - scattered quanta amplitudes , thereby increasing the probability amplitude of the stable state .",
    "+ the present method is very different from previous proposals @xcite to suppress decoherence by ultra fast measurements or modulation of the coupling with the continuum , which are all included in the _ universal formula _ of ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to effect decoherence suppression akin to the quantum zeno effect ( qze ) @xcite ,",
    "the measurements or modulation must be repeated at a rate exceeding the spectra width of the continuum ( its inverse spectral width ) which may be prohibitive : @xmath1  s@xmath2 for radiative continua @xcite , and @xmath3  s@xmath2 for vibrational continua @xcite . by contrast , the present method requires frequency shifts at a rate comparable to the energy of the qubit - continuum interaction at the edge , which is typically _ much lower _ than the inverse memory time of the continuum .",
    "furthermore , the ultrafast modulation ( qze ) strategy is valid only when the coupling to the continuum is weak , _",
    "i.e. _ , far enough from the continuum edge , whereas the present method works equally well for strong or weak coupling to the continuum , since it is based on _ phase - dependent _ changes of the qubit state that is `` dressed '' by the continuum , rather than on modulation of the `` bare '' state that is weakly perturbed by the `` bath '' @xcite .    in sec .",
