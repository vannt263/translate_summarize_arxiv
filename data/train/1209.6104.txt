    "very recently , there has been an increasing interest in the study of nonlinear partial differential equations involving fractional operators .",
    "such problems arise naturally in applications , like fluid dynamics @xcite , strange kinetics and anomalous transport @xcite , financial mathematics @xcite , among many others .",
    "fractional operators are very well - known from the functional analysis point of view , see the classical book by k. yosida @xcite . nevertheless , there are some issues in these nonlinear nonlocal fractional problems , not covered by the general theory , in which tools like pointwise formulas , hlder estimates and harnack s inequalities are needed @xcite .",
    "we study properties and regularity estimates of fractional powers of the laplacian @xmath13 on the @xmath1-dimensional torus @xmath2 , @xmath3 . applying an approach based on the heat semigroup",
    ", we obtain , in theorem [ thm : puntual ] below , a pointwise integro - differential formula for @xmath4 , @xmath5 , of the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a suitable singular kernel . by using this nonlocal formula ,",
    "we show in propositions [ prop : limit zero - n ] and [ prop : limit 2-n ] that for all @xmath6 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "observe the contrast of the identity above with the case of the laplacian @xmath18 on @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition  2.5 ) . taking into account the multiple fourier series definition of the fractional laplacian on @xmath2 ,",
    "@xmath21 see section [ section:2 ] , the identities in and are obvious , but as limits in @xmath22 . here",
    "we prove that the limits actually hold in the _ pointwise _ sense for a large class of functions .",
    "a crucial step for it is to compute all the constants appearing in the kernel @xmath15 exactly . we manage to do it avoiding the computation of inverse multiple fourier series .",
    "regularity properties of the fractional laplacian on hlder , lipschitz and zygmund spaces are also analyzed , see theorem [ thm : holder - n ] below .",
    "our idea here is , first , to characterize all these spaces of smooth functions with the heat semigroup as done in proposition [ prop : lambdas - n ] , and , secondly , to express the fractional laplacian on @xmath2 again with the semigroup : @xmath23 in this way we avoid the rather cumbersome computations with the pointwise formula .",
    "moreover , these ideas can be applied in other contexts as well .",
    "we mention that schauder and regularity estimates for the fractional laplacian on @xmath19 had been previously derived by l. silvestre in @xcite with the aid of the pointwise formula .",
    "hlder estimates for the fractional harmonic oscillator @xmath24 can be found in @xcite .    on the other hand , by using an extension problem due to stinga and torrea ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.1 ) we obtain , in theorems [ thm : interior harnack ] and [ thm : boundary harnack ] , interior and boundary harnack s inequalities for @xmath0 on @xmath2 . recall that in @xcite l. caffarelli and l. silvestre showed that any fractional power of the laplacian on @xmath19 can be determined as an operator that maps a dirichlet boundary condition to a neumann - type condition via an extension problem .",
    "namely , let @xmath25 be the solution to the boundary value problem @xmath26 then there exists a constant @xmath27 such that @xmath28 this was used , together with local pde techniques , to give a novel proof of harnack s inequalities for @xmath29 . since the extension equation is a degenerate elliptic equation in @xmath30 , the theory by e. b. fabes , d. jerison , c. kenig and r. serapioni @xcite was applied .",
    "we point out that interior harnack s inequality for the fractional laplacian on @xmath19 is classical @xcite .",
    "boundary harnack s estimates were first proved by k. bogdan in @xcite by using probabilistic techniques . in @xcite the caffarelli ",
    "silvestre extension problem was generalized to apply to general fractional operators @xmath9 , @xmath31 , where @xmath11 is a nonnegative self - adjoint linear operator on a hilbert space .",
    "the main idea in @xcite was to introduce the semigroup language in order to study fine properties of fractional operators .",
    "the extension problem technique was used to prove interior harnack s inequality for the fractional harmonic oscillator ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  1.2 ) ) and more general fractional divergence form elliptic operators @xmath32 on domains of @xmath19 ( see ( * ? ? ? * theorem  a ) ) . in such cases",
    "the extension equation becomes a degenerate elliptic schrdinger equation , so harnack s inequality proved by c. e. gutirrez in @xcite is needed .",
    "the advantage is that the extension equation is a local pde for which well - known techniques from the calculus of variations can be applied , see @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "the extension result of @xcite is extended to fractional operators @xmath9 , where @xmath33 is _ any _ noninteger positive number .",
    "the result is contained in theorem [ thm : extension problem ] below and it is of independent interest . in this way we answer a question raised by ricardo g.",
    "durn about how to characterize higher - order fractional laplacians via an extension problem .",
    "more comments in this direction can be found in the remarks of section [ section:6 ] .",
    "we would like to stress that the semigroup language we adopt here is the most adequate for our purposes .",
    "in particular , it allows us to compute all the constants exactly , to study regularity properties in a simple and general way and to have an explicit solution for the extension problem in terms of the underlying semigroup .",
    "we would also like to point out the following . at a first glance",
    ", it seems that one of the main difficulties to overcome when using to treat the fractional laplacian is that the heat kernel @xmath34 on @xmath2 is given as a series .",
    "there is not , up to our knowledge , a closed expression for @xmath34 . the lack of it ( as it happens , for instance , in a general riemannian manifold ) may well block the way to develop the analysis .",
    "it is clear that the singular kernel @xmath15 must be expressed as a series too , see below .",
    "it came as a surprise to us that , thanks to the poisson summation formula and the general semigroup language , we were still able to develop the analysis and manage the multiple fourier series . with this extra work , the results that one would expect with a closed formula follow here too .",
    "if we would like to make the full analysis with a closed expression for a semigroup kernel on the torus , we could use the poisson semigroup in @xmath35 .",
    "indeed , the poisson kernel on @xmath35 has the tractable closed formula .",
    "but now the problem is that is not the suitable definition for @xmath36 since it involves the heat kernel .",
    "we need to use a different equivalent definition to make appear the poisson semigroup , see below . in this way more close formulas for @xmath37 can be obtained and the results follow as well , see section [ section:1d ] .",
    "we close this circle of ideas by pointing out that any of the two approaches described above ( heat semigroup with kernel given as a series or poisson semigroup with kernel given by a closed formula , though only in one dimension ) are equally effective to establish the hlder regularity theory , see section [ sec : regularity ] and subsection [ subsection : regularity ] .",
    "the paper is divided into two parts . in the first one we focus on the definition of the fractional laplacian on the @xmath1-torus , the pointwise formula , the limits and and the regularity estimates in hlder , lipschitz and zygmund spaces for @xmath0 in @xmath2 .",
    "also , the one dimensional case is treated from the point of view of the poisson semigroup .",
    "part 2 contains the generalization of the extension problem to any positive power @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the interior and boundary harnack s inequalities for @xmath0 .    throughout this paper",
    "the letters @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote positive constants that may change at each occurrence . for two positive quantities @xmath40 and @xmath41 we write @xmath42 to denote that there exist constants @xmath43 independent of @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "denote by @xmath46 the unit circle in the complex plane @xmath47 .",
    "let @xmath48 ( @xmath1-times ) , @xmath3 , be the @xmath1-dimensional torus .",
    "consider the lattice @xmath49 of points in @xmath19 having integer coordinates .",
    "there is a natural identification @xmath50 given by the mapping @xmath51 . from here",
    "we can identify functions defined on @xmath2 with @xmath52-periodic functions @xmath53 on @xmath19 , that is , functions on @xmath19 for which @xmath54 , for all @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this type of periodic functions on @xmath19 are completely determined once their values at the so - called _ fundamental cube _ @xmath57^n\\ ] ] are fixed .",
    "hence we will sometimes identify the @xmath1-torus and functions on @xmath2 with the fundamental cube @xmath58 and @xmath52-periodic functions on @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "measurability of functions defined on @xmath2 is given through this identification .",
    "in the same way , @xmath59 if and only if @xmath53 has a @xmath52-periodic extension to @xmath19 which belongs to @xmath60 . also ,",
    "integration over @xmath2 can be described in terms of lebesgue integration over @xmath58 : @xmath61 where in the right hand side the integrand is the restriction to @xmath58 of the periodic extension of @xmath53 . in this way we have a natural way to define @xmath62 spaces on @xmath2 , @xmath63 .",

    "note that , since @xmath53 is smooth , for any @xmath83 there exists a constant @xmath84 such that @xmath85 , for all @xmath56 , @xmath86 . therefore , the series that defines @xmath87 is absolutely convergent and it is a @xmath88-function .",
