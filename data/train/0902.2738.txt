    "the study of scale - invariant phenomena has unravelled interesting and somewhat unexpected behaviours in systems belonging to disciplines of different nature , from physical and biological to technological and social sciences  @xcite .",
    "indeed , empirical data from percolation theory and nuclear multifragmentation  @xcite reflect scale - invariant behaviour , and so do the abundances of genes in various organisms and tissues  @xcite , the frequency of words in natural languages  @xcite , scientific collaboration networks  @xcite , the internet traffic  @xcite , linux packages links  @xcite , as well as electoral results  @xcite , urban agglomerations  @xcite and firm sizes all over the world  @xcite .    the common feature in these systems is the lack of a characteristic size , length or frequency for an observable @xmath0 at study .",
    "this lack generally leads to a power law distribution @xmath1 , valid in most of the domain of definition of @xmath0 , @xmath2 with @xmath3 .",
    "special attention has been paid to the class of universality defined by @xmath4 , which corresponds to zipf s law in the cumulative distribution or the rank - size distribution  @xcite .",
    "recently , maillart et al .",
    "@xcite have studied the evolution of the number of links to open source software projects in linux packages , and have found that the link distribution follows zipf s law as a consequence of stochastic proportional growth . in its simplest formulation , the stochastic proportional growth model , or namely the geometric brownian motion , assumes the growth of an element of the system to be proportional to its size @xmath0 , and to be governed by a stochastic wiener process .",
    "the class @xmath4 emerges from the condition of stationarity , i.e. , when the system reaches a dynamic equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "there is a variety of models arising in different fields that yield zipf s law and other power laws on a case - by - case basis  @xcite . in the context of complex networks ,",
    "proportional growth processes known as preferential attachment  @xcite and competitive cluster growth  @xcite have been used to explain many of the properties of natural networks , from social to biological .",
    "the emergence of power laws in all these models is explained by w. j. redd and b. d. hughes  @xcite , which have shown analytically that models based on stochastic processes with exponential growth as the geometric brownian motion , discrete multiplicative process , the birth - and - death process , or the galton - watson branching process generate power laws in one of both tails of the statistical distributions .",
    "however , in spite of the success of these models , the intrinsic complexity involved makes the study at a macroscopic level difficult since a general formulation of the thermodynamics of scale - invariant physics is not established yet .",
    "frieden et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that equilibrium and non - equilibrium thermodynamics can be derived from the principle of extreme fisher information .",
    "the information measure is done for the particular case of _ translation families _ ,",
    "i.e. , distribution functions whose form does not change under translational transformations . in this case , fisher measure becomes _ shift - invariant _",
    "@xcite , what yields most of the canonical hamiltonians of theoretical physics  @xcite .",
    "variations of the information measure lead to a schrdinger equation  @xcite for the probability amplitude , where the ground state describes equilibrium physics and the excited states account for non - equilibrium physics . as for hamiltonian systems",
    "@xcite , it has been recently shown that the principle of extreme physical information allows to describe the behaviour of complex systems , as the allometric or power laws found in biological sciences  @xcite .    in this work we present a theoretical framework based on the principle of extreme physical information that aims to describe scale - invariant systems at a macroscopic level",
    "we show that the thermodynamics for such systems can be formulated when the information measure is taken on distributions that do not change under _ scale _ transformations .",
    "we show that proportional growth is intrinsic to this symmetry , and the processes that describe zipf s law , as the geometrical brownian motion , are the equivalent microscopic description of these systems .",
