    "given the potential impact of observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation on our understanding of the large scale properties of the universe , there is a strong case for developing a physically transparent and portable formalism for the study of cmb physics .",
    "ideally , such a framework should allow one to give : ( i ) an exact , but physically illuminating description of all the relevant physics ; ( ii ) a simple , gauge - invariant linear perturbation theory around a variety of background models .",
    "along with many other workers in this field  @xcite@xcite , we have found the 1 + 3 covariant formulation of hydrodynamics  @xcite and radiative transport theory  @xcite to be well suited to this task .    in this contribution",
    "we begin by reviewing the exact 1 + 3 covariant theory of polarized radiative transport in the presence of thomson scattering ( the dominant scattering mechanism for cmb photons over the epoch of interest ) .",
    "this work builds on the covariant approach to kinetic theory developed in  @xcite .",
    "the angular dependence of the intensity and polarization are conveniently described in terms of projected symmetric trace free ( pstf ) tensors .",
    "the multipole equations governing the dynamics of these radiation variables are given in linearised form around an almost - frw universe , and generic features of their solution are discussed qualitatively . by further decomposing the linearised multipole equations in harmonic functions , we arrive at a complete set of gauge - invariant perturbation equations in a form which is convenient for numerical implementation , but which still preserves the physical transparency of the 1 + 3 covariant approach .",
    "we present the mode - expanded perturbation equations for scalar ( density clumping ) modes , and discuss briefly their numerical implementation and some numerical results .",
    "we employ standard general relativity and adopt a @xmath0 signature for the metric @xmath1 .",
    "our conventions for the riemann and ricci tensors are fixed by @xmath2u_c={r_{abc}}^d u_d$ ] and @xmath3 .",
    "the spacetime alternating tensor is denoted @xmath4 .",
    "round brackets denote symmetrisation on the enclosed indices , square brackets denote antisymmetrisation , and angle brackets denote the pstf part ( the projection is with @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the fundamental velocity of the 1 + 3 approach ) .",
    "overdots denote the action of @xmath7 , and the totally projected covariant `` derivative '' is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "in the 1 + 3 covariant approach to cosmology ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) , the cosmological model is described in terms of geometric variables that have a direct interpretation in terms of the observations of a preferred set of observers who are comoving with the fundamental velocity field @xmath9 .",
    "we shall refer to the choice of @xmath9 as a frame choice in an appropriate physical manner is discussed in  @xcite . ] .",
    "we consider a diffuse radiation field ( the cmb ) observed from the @xmath9 frame .",
    "the stokes parameters of the radiation in some solid angle @xmath10 and some photon energy range @xmath11 , along the unit projected vector @xmath12 , can be combined into a second - rank polarization tensor @xmath13 which is projected relative to @xmath9 and @xmath12 on both indices .",
    "the non - vanishing components of @xmath13 on an orthonormal tetrad with the 0-direction aligned with @xmath9 and the 3-direction with @xmath12 are defined in terms of the stokes parameters via : @xmath14 \\notag \\\\",

    "since @xmath21 and @xmath22 are scalar fields on the sphere they can be expanded as follows : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are energy - dependent pstf tensors , and we have introduced the index notation @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the expansions of @xmath21 and @xmath22 can be inverted to determine the multipoles , for example @xmath28 for the linear polarization tensor @xmath19 we must expand in tensor spherical harmonics that are projected perpendicular to @xmath12 ( tensors projected perpendicular to @xmath12 , such as @xmath19 , are denoted transverse in  @xcite ) .",

    "the 1 + 3 covariant formulation of radiative transfer provides a convenient , exact framework within which to study cmb physics .",
    "although we have only considered the linearised form of the transfer equations in our discussion of the anisotropy and polarization in an almost - frw universe , the formalism is of wider applicability .",
    "for example , the approach appears well suited to a systematic study of second - order geometric and scattering effects  @xcite . in the application to linearised cmb physics in an almost - frw universe , the 1 + 3 covariant perturbative approach shares many of the advantages of the `` total angular momentum '' method  @xcite .",
    "these include physical transparency , the explicitly quadrupole nature of the radiative source terms in the boltzmann equation that arise from the angular and polarization dependence of the thomson cross section , and the direct manner in which the angular multipoles describe the angular scale of anisotropy on the sky .",
    "however , the 1 + 3 covariant method goes further by ensuring manifest gauge - invariance , by deferring any non - local splitting of the perturbations until a late stage of the calculation , and by providing a straightforward linearisation procedure around a variety of background models .",
