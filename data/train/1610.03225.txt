    "the concerns about the climate change require deeper learning about the uncertainties in future predictions of climate system .",
    "however , our cutting - age science appears helpless to describe processes which take place beyond the yearly cycle of the climate system .",
    "the main question in this regard will be _ why there is an urgent need for such studies ? _",
    "it is now well known that many of long - term processes ( millennial scale ) in the climate system may have a large impact on predicting the climate even in shorter time scales ( decadal , yearly scales ) @xcite . according to @xcite",
    ", the atmosphere shows an extremely changing behaviour @xmath0 _ `` more than 20 orders of magnitude in time and 10 in space : billions of years to milliseconds and tens of thousands of kilometers to millimeters''_. there exist several challenging open questions in the field of future climatic change : how variable is the future climate ?",
    ", what is the probability of extreme future climate changes ? , how would this impact the sea level rise ? +      available observational climate data sets are the most accurate source of knowledge about the climate system",
    ". however they suffer from ill structural conditions : ( i ) time span of these data sets are usually less than a century , ( ii ) they change their accuracy in time ( environmental changes in station location , usage of different measuring devices , urbanization ) , ( iii ) they change their density in time ( more stations are available online in recent years ) ,",
    "( iv ) more numbers of stations over land than over oceans .",
    "climate proxy archives ( tree ring , coral , sediment and glacial ) are alternative , indirect climate observations which posses a recording characteristic @xcite .",
    "the best resolved features of climate recorded by proxies are of annual and seasonal cycles",
    ". however , the data recording process involved in such observations are very complex , encompassing physical , biological and chemical processes @xcite .",
    "differentiating the climate and human impact on proxies is also a challenging work , for example , in terms of historical drought spells .",
    "the difficult challenge of inverting proxy records into climate information is traditionally done in the frame work of statistical modeling . however , multivariate linear regression techniques dominate this area @xcite . on the other hand , even using more sophisticated statistical models is problematic in a way that the overlapping time span between the instrumental records ( weather station observations ) and the proxy records are too short to train the statistical models .",
    "climate model hindcast may serve as a modeling idea to study the long term climate variability .",
    "the climate models create dynamically consistent state of the climate using numerical methods . however , their reconstructed states are very sensible to the initial conditions and the forcing used in the model as well as parametrization schemes used for sub - grid scale processes ( small processes which are not physically presented by model ) .",
    "one of the novel and appealing approaches to reconstruct the past climate is data assimilation ( da ) which blends the proxy records and the climate models @xcite .      for a review of da techniques applied in climate studies ( not the weather forecasting )",
    ", i refer to the works of @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the climate models may not have forecasting skills longer than several years .",
    "this fact makes the usage of classical da methods very limited .",
    "the models lose their skill shortly after initialization and will evolve freely till the next step where the observations ( in form of proxies ) are available .    considering the implementation ramification of da methods in climate systems , their extremely computational expenses and the short forecasting skill of the models ,",
    "an alternative da approach ( `` off - line '' or `` no - cycling '' ) was applied by several scholars @xcite . to my knowledge , there exists no study which applies such strategies in high resolution regional climate model ( rcm ) simulations for long term climate studies .    in this study",
    ", i will apply an off - line da ( oda ) approach in a rcm simulation and test the performance of this method .",
    "i will present the problematic features of rcms in simulating the climate and demonstrate the performance of very cheap statistical methods to correct the model s bias by means of oda .",
    "the numerical rcm used in this study is the cosmo - clm ( cclm ) model version cosmo@xmath1131108@xmath15.00@xmath1clm8 @xcite .",

    "the full model set - up file is included in the supplementary materials . ``",
    "the cclm model is a non - hydrostatic rcm which uses terrain following height coordinates @xcite , developed from the cosmo model , the current weather forecast model used by the german weather service ( dwd)''@xcite . in order to investigate the sensitivity of rcm to the initial conditions ,",
    "two sets of simulations are conducted : +    * * default * ( * nature * ) simulation : 6 years long simulation over europe driven by global atmospheric reanalysis data ( 6 hourly ) produced by the european centre for medium - range weather forecasts ( ecmwf ) , the so - called erainterim @xcite ( initial and boundary conditions are taken from erainterim ) .",
    "this run will be used as the `` nature '' or `` true '' state of the climate in the investigations . *",
    "* shifted * domain simulation : the same as * default * but shifted 4 grid points to the northwest compared with the * default*.      the skill of the * _ forecast _ * ( or _ prior _ ) state of the * shifted * simulation ( without da ) can be measured , by the root mean square error ( rmse ) :    @xmath4    where @xmath5 denotes the time mean operator .",
    "figure [ fig:01 ] shows the monthly near surface temperature ( 2 meter temperature ) rmse between the * nature * and the * shifted * simulations over the evaluation domain . for evaluation ,",
    "the relaxation zone ( the region where the boundary data is relaxed in the rcm , here 20 grid points next to the lateral boundaries ) is removed .",
    "the last year of the simulations is used for validation and the first 5 years are considered as spin - up .",
    "the 2 meter temperature ( t2 m ) over oceans in cclm model is interpolated from the driving model ( here erainterim ) and not calculated by the model .",
    "therefore the rmses over oceans are masked out from the analysis and only values over lands are shown .    ]",
    "prior to describing the da methodology , i give a brief review of the optimal interpolation ( oi ) method ( for the full review see @xcite ) .",
    "oi or `` objective analysis '' or `` kriging '' is one of the most commonly used and fairly simple da methods applied since 1970s .",
    "the unknown state of the climate @xmath6 is the vector which has to be estimated based on the available observations ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "given the state vector @xmath6 , the state on observations location is obtained by an interpolation method ( here nearest neighbor ) .",
    "this operation is noted as matrix @xmath8 and the state at the observations location as @xmath9 .",
    "the ultimate goal is to find the nearest state to the `` true '' state of the climate ( @xmath10 ) the so - called _ analysis _ ( @xmath11 ) given the observation ( @xmath7 ) and background @xmath12 ( first guess ) .",
    "the background and observation can be written as :    @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the observation and background errors , respectively .      in the applied oi scheme here",

    "it has the lowest error variance ( optimal error variance ) .",

    "equation [ eq:9 ] can be written as :    @xmath24    thus the error covariance of the * _ analysis _ * will be : @xmath25 = ( i - kh)p^{b}(i - kh)^{t } + krk^t\\ ] ]    the trace of matrix @xmath26 indicates the error covariance of the analysis : @xmath27    given that the total error variance of * _ analysis _ * has its minimum value , a small @xmath28 will not modify the total variance : @xmath29\\delta k^{t } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    given that the @xmath28 is arbitrary , the kalman gain is : @xmath30 finally , the error covariance of the blue is given by : @xmath31    in the scheme used here , @xmath32 is parametrized as following : @xmath33 where the @xmath34 is the error variance and @xmath35 the correlation length ( or scanning radius ) .",
    "the number of influential observations which contribute to each grid point has also to be given as the input variable .",
    "models contain systematic errors which may have diverse origins ( dynamical core , parametrization , initialization ) .",
    "da schemes are also based on simplified hypotheses and are imperfect ( e.g. , here the gaussian parametrization for @xmath32 ) .",
    "all these sources of errors may also interact with one another in a way that tracing the source of problem may be impossible . in recent studies @xcite these error sources",
    "are neglected by using a simplified numerical experiment called osse .",
    "the osse used in this study is described by the schematic shown in figure [ fig:02 ] .",
    "first the * nature * model simulation @xmath36 ( `` true '' run ) is conducted as the final prediction target . then using the output from * nature * run and adding random draws from a white noise distribution ( with @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) ,",
    "the pseudo - observations are created which are interpolated over the observations location . and",
    "finally , applying the oi scheme on the new * _ forecast _ * ( * shifted * ) run , the observationally constrained run @xmath39 is obtained by assimilating the noisy observations .",

    "[ fig:02 ] ]",
    "comparing the two simulations exhibits that a slight change in the initial conditions of a rcm leads to large values ( more than @xmath40 in monthly values ) of internal variability in the model * _ forecast _ * ( fig.[fig:01 ] ) .",
    "this feature has to be considered cautiously when conduction long - term climate simulations using rcms , especially for the future climate projections .",
    "here , i will show that the oi can significantly reduce the bias of the model * _ forecast _ * by assimilating the pseudo - observations .",
    "the product of the oi is called * _ analysis _ * , hereafter . knowing the `` true '' state of the climate ( * nature * run ) , the @xmath34 the error variance can be estimated .",
    "the location of 500 random meteorological stations of the `` ensembles daily gridded observational dataset for precipitation , temperature and sea level pressure in europe called e - obs '' @xcite are used in this study to create the pseudo - observation data ( fig.[fig:03 ] ) .    ]    in order to find the optimal correlation length ( @xmath41 ) ,",
    "i have calculated the mean rmse for the whole evaluation domain with several different correlation lengths ( @xmath42 ) as well as with different number of observations ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "figure [ fig:04 ] shows that the more the number of assimilated observations the lower the rmse values are .",

    "using an osee , i conducted a simple numerical experiment to highlight the problematic features of rcms in prediction of the near surface temperatures over europe . by applying a fast and cheap da method",
    ", i demonstrated that despite the easiness of oi , it can significantly reduce the bias of the regional model for monthly averaged values of near surface temperature .",
    "this method could potentially be applied for conducting long - term climate reanalysis data - sets with less complications than the classical da methods . however , for a real application of this method , there exist several open questions : ( i ) is there enough proxy data available for the study region ( for example less coverage over central asia ) ? ( ii ) how is the accuracy of the data in value and timing ? ( iii ) with which data we shall drive the rcm ( for initialization and boundary conditions ) ?",
    "the simulations in this study are driven with erainterim which is produced by sophisticated methodologies combining available observations and models for the recent time ( last 40 years ) .",
    "for the past climate simulations which go beyond the time - span of observations ( i.e. , for time spans greater than several centuries ) , the uncertainties in the model initialization and forcing ( i.e. , radiation , anthropogenic , volcanic ) will increase significantly . therefore , for such studies usage of ensemble simulation approach ( different models , different initializations , different forcing )",
    "is of important interest and should be considered . however , by applying an ensemble of simulations the complexity and implementation of data analysis will increase exponentially . such a cheap and fast method presented here , may pave the wave for handling these big data - sets in a way that the models bias are corrected by available observations .",
