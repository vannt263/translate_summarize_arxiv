    "<S> we demonstrate experimentally that the spectral broadening of cw supercontinuum can be controlled by using photonic crystal fibers with two zero - dispersion wavelengths pumped by an yb fiber laser at 1064  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is bounded by two dispersive waves whose spectral location depends on the two zero - dispersion wavelengths of the fiber . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth of the generated spectrum and the spectral power density may thus be tailored for particular applications , such as high - resolution optical coherence tomography or optical spectroscopy .    </S>",
    "<S> the continuous - wave ( cw ) pumping regime has been recently proposed as an interesting alternative to pulsed lasers for the generation of strong supercontinuum ( sc ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sources based on cw sc are characterized by a substantial lower intensity noise , a lower coherence length , a higher stability and a higher spectral power density than their pulsed counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , photonic crystal fibers ( pcfs ) can be spliced to recently developed cw fiber lasers , preserving the all - fiber format . </S>",
    "<S> these features are of particular interest for ultrahigh resolution optical coherence tomography for instance . </S>",
    "<S> sc spectra generated with a pcf pumped by a cw yb fiber laser were reported in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> about 700  nm - wide spectra with high spectral power densities ( in the order of 10  mw / nm ) were obtained . </S>",
    "<S> but one drawback of these configurations is that the bandwidth of the sc spectrum is not easily adjustable to the one required for a particular application . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> the pump power budget is not optimized if the application requires a given spectral power density over a particular spectral range , as this is actually the case for many potential applications . quite recently </S>",
    "<S> , it has however been numerically demonstrated that a simple scheme based on a pcf with two - zero dispersion wavelengths allows a tailoring of the sc spectrum extent , and consequently of the spectral power density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these numerical results are of great potential interest for the reasons stated before . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we provide an experimental proof - of - principle of this novel technique by pumping pcfs with a cw yb fiber laser . </S>",
    "<S> we experimentally show that the generated sc spectrum can be tailored through a suitable design of the group velocity dispersion ( gvd ) of the fiber , and in particular of the position of its two zdws , as predicted numerically @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we report the generation of 200  nm and 500  nm wide spectra in two slightly different pcfs with two zero - dispersion wavelengths ( zdws ) . </S>",
    "<S> the sc is achieved by pumping in the anomalous dispersion region , just between the two zdws . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that a slight modification of the dispersion curve allows the control of the sc extension and consequently permits to optimize the pump power budget for particular applications .    </S>",
    "<S> for the sake of simplicity and clarity , we recall here only on the basic mechanisms involved in sc generation in cw pumping regime . a detailed theoretical analysis of the sc formation is given in ref .  @xcite . in the first stage , </S>",
    "<S> modulational instability converts the cw field into a train of quasi - solitonic pulses of a few picoseconds duration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these pulses experience higher - order linear and nonlinear effects so that they become unstable . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , they shed energy away to dispersive waves ( dws ) which are phase - matched with the solitonic waves @xcite . from this phase - matching condition that depends on the gvd and on the nonlinear phase mismatch of the solitonic waves @xcite , one can estimate the spectral position of the dws . on the contrary to fibers with a single zdw </S>",
    "<S> where only one dw is phase - matched with one solitonic pulse , in fibers with two zdws there are two wavelengths for which the phase - matching condition is satisfied . consequently , two dws are generated : one is located on the blue side of the lower zdw and the other one is located on the red side of the higher zdw . additionally the stimulated raman scattering shifts the solitons towards longer wavelengths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this so - called soliton self - frequency shift stops just below the second zdw because a balance is achieved between the red shift due to srs and the blue shift due to spectral recoil when the dispersion slope of the fiber is negative @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is worth noting that even more complex nonlinear interactions should occur during the propagation of such strong pulses in a low dispersion region , such as soliton collisions that can reinforce the frequency shift towards long wavelengths @xcite . providing that the pump wavelength is located between both zdws in a low anomalous dispersion regime </S>",
    "<S> , one can simply summarize that the sc extension is roughly limited by the spectral separation between the two dws .    in order to experimentally demonstrate the numerical results predicted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we designed two pcfs with two zdws from part to part of the pump wavelength at 1064  nm , and a low anomalous dispersion region at this wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> this can be achieved for a relatively small hole - to - hole spacing @xmath0 in the order of 1.6  @xmath1 m , and a @xmath2 value of about 0.4 , with @xmath3 being the hole diameter @xcite . for </S>",
    "<S> a reasonable number of seven air - hole rings , such a small pitch leads to relatively important confinement losses around 1500  nm , where the sc is expected to extend . </S>",
    "<S> we numerically evaluated these losses with a finite - elements method ( fem ) , and we found that they were in the order of 1000  db / km at 1500  nm . to overcome this problem , we replaced the seventh air - hole period with a ring of larger air holes ( @xmath4 ) , as can be seen in the scanning electron micrograph ( sem ) represented in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> confinement losses were thus reduced to about 1  db / km at 1500  nm , which is an acceptable value for experiments performed in tens of meters long fibers , as required for cw sc generation . another way to reduce confinement losses without adding such an air - clad structure would be to use a higher number of uniform air - hole rings ( typically ten or eleven ) . however </S>",
    "<S> , this would make the fabrication process a lot trickier since this would approximately double the total number of holes in the cladding .    </S>",
    "<S> we fabricated two pcfs labeled fiber a and fiber b in what follows . </S>",
    "<S> they were designed to exhibit a gvd curve similar to that of pcf1 and pcf2 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the gvd curves of the fabricated fibers were calculated from high resolution sems with a fem package . </S>",
    "<S> they are represented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] together with an example of sem for fiber b in inset . </S>",
    "<S> they both exhibit a convex shape with two zdws located on each side of the pump wavelength ( represented by the vertical dashed line in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the basic characteristics of the fabricated pcfs are also summarized in table  [ tab1 ] for the sake of clarity . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen from this table that the parameters of fibers a and b are very close to those of pcf1 and pcf2 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear coefficient @xmath5 was deduced from the computed effective area at 1064  nm , by taking the typical value of @xmath6 = 2.6@xmath710@xmath8  m@xmath9.w@xmath10 for the nonlinear refractive index of silica @xcite . the nonlinear coefficient of both pcfs was in the order of 25  w@xmath10.km@xmath10 at 1064  nm . </S>",
    "<S> note that this value is about twice higher than the nonlinear coefficient of pcfs with a single zdw around 1064  nm usually designed for sc generation @xcite . since the two zdws of fiber a are closer than the ones of fiber b , a broader sc is expected in fiber b according to the theoretical study summarized above and detailed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the pcfs were pumped with a linearly polarized cw yb fiber laser ( ipg ) delivering 20  w at 1064  nm with a full width half maximum of 0.5  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the setup is displayed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the collimated beam with a 5  mm diameter ( at @xmath11 ) was sent through an afocal setup made of two ir - coated lenses in order to reduce the spot size by a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> about 70 % of the pump power was launched into the fibers by using appropriate aspherical lens . however , even though most of the pump power is coupled into the core of the pcfs , there is a small amount of pump power launched and guided in the inner cladding because of the last ring of holes ( larger air holes with @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the total power of 14  w launched into the fibers does not contribute completely to the sc generation . </S>",
    "<S> the output light was butt - coupled to a standard single - mode pigtail in order to record the spectra with an optical spectrum analyzer ( osa ) . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig2 ] shows the spectra measured for the two pcfs under investigation .    </S>",
    "<S> in fiber a ( with the zdws separated by only 161  nm ) , we obtained a relatively narrow spectrum ranging from 1000 nm to about 1200 nm it is important to note that the upper limit of the sc ( @xmath121200  nm ) is well below the oh absorption peak ( 1380  nm ) , which can consequently not be involved to explain the limitation of the sc extension . </S>",
    "<S> the total average output power was 9  w. in fiber b ( with the zdws separated by 285  nm ) , the sc spectrum is much broader than in fiber a. it spans from 1050  nm to 1550  nm , with an important dip around 1400  nm due to important losses at this wavelength due to water absorption ( measured to be about 300  db / km at 1380  nm ) . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the average output power is reduced to 6.3  w. note that the spectrum generated in fiber b is limited by the pump on the low wavelength side rather than by the blue - shifted dw . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the fact that this blue - shifted dw is very weak because its spectral shift with the soliton is very important @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also important to note that the spectral boundaries of both experimental spectra are in very good agreement with the ones predicted by numerical simulations for corresponding pcfs in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental results thus clearly reveal that the sc spectrum is actually bounded by the presence of two dws as expected . for both fibers </S>",
    "<S> , we checked that the general shape of the output spectrum and especially its upper and lower limits did not change when fibers longer than 60  m were used . in that case </S>",
    "<S> , there was only a reduction of the output power due to absorption losses , and more pump power was converted in the sc . on the contrary , by shortening the fiber length to less than 60  m , the bandwidth of the sc was strongly reduced and most of the output power was located in the vicinity of the pump wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> we found that a length of 60  m was a good compromise between the output power and the conversion efficiency of the pump power into the sc .    above the fundamental study and </S>",
    "<S> the experimental demonstration reported in the present paper , we believe that sc - based sources with a controllable generated spectrum would be of great interest for numerous applications . however , this would require a very good temporal stability and an improved flatness of the output spectrum . indeed , in the case of the `` free space '' injection setup used in our study , the output spectrum was stable just over a few minutes at full pump power . </S>",
    "<S> after this duration , the output power and the stability of the spectrum began to decay because of thermal effects at the fiber input . although the stability over a few minutes is sufficient to record the spectrum with an osa without any trouble , it will not be suitable for most of potential applications . </S>",
    "<S> this crucial limitation could be overcome by directly splicing the pcf to the fiber laser output . </S>",
    "<S> a careful splice would also present the advantage of increasing the amount of pump power launched into the core by limiting the power coupled into the inner cladding . </S>",
    "<S> this would consequently improve the conversion of the pump power into the sc , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ the spectral power density at the fiber output . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the dip around 1400  nm in the spectrum could be removed by reducing the oh contamination with a suitable cleaning of the stacked pcf preform @xcite .    in conclusion , we have studied cw sc generation in pcfs with two zero - dispersion wavelengths located around the pump wavelength . by a suitable control of the position of both zdws and of the dispersion value at the pump wavelength , we evidenced experimentally for the fisrt time to our knowledge the possibility of tailoring the sc spectrum . by this way </S>",
    "<S> , the sc extension and the output power can be adjusted over the spectral range of interest required for a particular application in the near ir . </S>",
    "<S> this represents an important step towards optimizing the pump power budget for a given application of sc - based sources . </S>",
    "<S> next steps will consist in improving the flatness of the sc by reducing the water contamination and to directly splice the laser source with the pcf . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this all fiber sc light source would become an useful tool for oct applications for example .    </S>",
