    "the complex error function also widely known as the faddeeva function can be defined as @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the complex argument .",
    "it is a solution of the following differential equation @xcite @xmath4 where the initial condition is given by @xmath5    the complex error function is principal in a family of special functions .",
    "the main functions from this family are the dawsons integral , the complex probability function , the error function , the fresnel integral and the normal distribution function .",
    "the dawsons integral is defined as @xcite @xmath6 it is not difficult to obtain a relation between the complex error function and the dawson integral . in particular , comparing right sides of equations and immediately yields @xmath7    another closely related function is the complex probability function . in order to emphasize the continuity of the complex probability function at @xmath8",
    ", it may be convenient to define it in form of principal value integral @xcite @xmath9 or @xmath10 the complex probability function has no discontinuity at @xmath11 and @xmath12 since according to the principal value we can write @xmath13 where @xmath14 $ ] .",
    "there is a direct relationship between the complex error function and the complex probability function . in particular",
    ", it can be shown that these functions are actually same on the upper half of the complex plain @xcite @xmath15 \\ge 0.\\ ] ] separating the real and imaginary parts of the complex probability function leads to @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively , where the principal value notations emphasize that these functions have no discontinuity at @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "in particular , in accordance with equation we can write @xmath18 and @xmath19 as it follows from the identity , for non - negative @xmath20 we have @xmath21    the real part @xmath22 of the complex probability function is commonly known as the voigt function that is widely used in many disciplines of applied mathematics @xcite , physics @xcite and astronomy @xcite .",
    "mathematically , the voigt function @xmath22 represents a convolution integral of the gaussian and cauchy distributions @xcite .",
    "the voigt function is widely used in spectroscopy as it describes quite accurately the line broadening effects @xcite .",
    "although the imaginary part @xmath23 of the complex probability function also finds many practical applications ( see for example @xcite ) , it has no a specific name .",
    "therefore , further we will regard this function simply as the @xmath24-function .",
    "other associated functions are the error function of complex argument @xcite @xmath25 \\quad   \\leftrightarrow \\quad { \\rm{erf}}\\left ( z \\right ) = 1 - { e^ { - { z^2}}}w\\left ( { iz } \\right),\\ ] ] the plasma dispersion function @xcite @xmath26 the fresnel integral @xcite @xmath27/2 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the normal distribution function @xcite @xmath28 . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    due to a remarkable identity of the complex error function @xcite @xmath29 it is sufficient to consider only i and ii quadrants in order to cover the entire complex plane ( see appendix a ) .",
    "this property can be explicitly observed by rearranging this identity in form @xmath30 thus , due to this remarkable identity of the complex error function we can always avoid computations involving negative argument @xmath20 by using simply the right side of this equation .",
    "therefore , we will always assume further that @xmath31 .",
    "since the integral on right side of the equation has no analytical solution , the computation of the complex error function must be performed numerically .",
    "there are many approximations of the complex error function have been reported in the scientific literature @xcite .",
    "however , approximations based on rational functions may be more advantageous to gain computational efficiency due to no requirement for nested loop involving decelerating exponential or trigonometric functions dependent upon input the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath20 .",
    "although the rational approximations of the complex error function are rapid and provide high - accuracy over the most area of the complex plain , all of them have the same drawback ; their accuracy deteriorates with decreasing parameter @xmath20 ( in fact , the computation of the complex error function at small @xmath33 is commonly considered problematic for high - accuracy computation of the voigt / complex error function not only in the rational approximations @xcite ) . in this work",
    "we propose a new rational approximation of the dawson integral and show how its algorithmic implementation effectively resolves such a problem in computation of the complex error function at small @xmath33 .",
    "in our recent publication @xcite we have shown that a new methodology of the fourier transform results in a rational approximation @xmath34 where the corresponding expansion coefficients are given by @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the step .",
    "in algorithmic implementation it is convenient to rewrite the equation above in form @xmath39    using the residue calculus , from approximation we can obtain the rational approximation for the @xmath24-function ( see appendix b ) @xmath40.\\ ] ] as @xmath41 $ ] from the identity it follows that @xmath42 = \\frac{{\\sqrt \\pi   } } { 2}l\\left ( x \\right).\\ ] ] consequently , according to this identity and equation we can write @xmath43.\\ ] ] since the argument @xmath32 is real , it would be reasonable to assume that this equation remains valid for a complex argument @xmath3 as well if the condition @xmath33 is satisfied . therefore , substituting the rational approximation of the dawson integral into identity results in @xmath44 , \\qquad     { \\mathop{\\rm im}\\nolimits } \\left [ z \\right ] <   < 1 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the representation of the approximation can be significantly simplified as given by @xmath45",
    "<   < 1 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the expansion coefficients are @xmath46 @xmath47 and @xmath48    as we can see from equation only the @xmath49-function needs a nested loop in multiple summation .",
    "therefore , most time required for computation of the complex error function is taken for determination of the @xmath49-function . however , this approximation is rapid due to its simple rational function representation .",
    "although the first term @xmath50 in approximation is an exponential function dependent upon the input parameter @xmath51 , it does not decelerate the computation since this term is not nested and calculated only once .",
    "consequently , the approximation is almost as fast as the rational approximation .",
    "the relatively large area at the origin of complex plane is the most difficult for computation with high - accuracy . according to karbach _",
    "@xcite the newest version of the _ roofit _ package , written in c / c++ code , utilizes the equation ( 14 ) from the work @xcite in order to cover accurately this area , shaped as a square with side lengths equal to @xmath52 .        in the algorithm we have developed , instead of the square",
    "we apply a circle with radius @xmath53 centered at the origin .",
    "this circle separates the complex plane into the inner and outer parts .",
    "only three approximations can be applied to cover the entire complex plain with high - accuracy .",
    "the outer part of the circle is an external domain while the inner part of the circle is an internal domain consisting of the primary and secondary subdomains .",
    "these domains are schematically shown in fig . 1 .",
    "external domain is determined by boundary @xmath54 and represents the outer area of the circle as shown in fig .",
    "in order to cover this domain we apply the truncated laplace continued fraction @xcite @xmath55 that provides a rapid computation with high - accuracy .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the accuracy of the laplace continued fraction deteriorates as @xmath56 decreases .",
    "the inner part of the circle bounded by @xmath57 is divided into two subdomains .",
    "most area inside the circle is occupied by primary subdomain bounded by @xmath58 . for this domain",
    "we apply the rational approximation that approaches the limit of double precision when we take @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see our recent publication @xcite for description in determination of the parameter @xmath38 ) .",
    "the secondary subdomain within the circle is bounded by narrow band @xmath1 ( see fig . 1 along @xmath32-axis ) .",
    "the rational approximation sustains high - accuracy within all domain @xmath62 required for applications using the hitran molecular spectroscopic database @xcite .",
    "however , at @xmath63 its accuracy deteriorates by roughly one order of the magnitude as @xmath20 decreases by factor of @xmath64 .",
    "the proposed approximation perfectly covers the range @xmath33 .",
    "in particular , at @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 this approximation also approaches the limit of double precision as the parameter @xmath20 tends to zero .    in order to quantify the accuracy of the algorithm we can use the relative errors defined for the real and imaginary parts as follows @xmath65 - { \\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits } \\left [ { w\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right]}}{{{\\mathop{\\rm re}\\nolimits } \\left [ { { w_{ref}}\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right ] } } } \\right|\\ ] ] and @xmath66 - { \\mathop{\\rm im}\\nolimits } \\left [ { w\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right]}}{{{\\mathop{\\rm im}\\nolimits } \\left [ { { w_{ref}}\\left ( { x , y } \\right ) } \\right ] } } } \\right|,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the reference . the highly accurate reference values can be generated by using , for example , algorithm 680 @xcite , algorithm 916 @xcite or a recent c++ code in _",
    "package from the cern s library @xcite .",
    "consider figs . 2 and 3 illustrating logarithms of relative errors of the considered algorithm for the real and imaginary parts over the domain @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "the rough surface of these plots indicates that the computation reaches the limit of double precision @xmath69 .",
    "in particular , while @xmath70 the accuracy can exceed @xmath71 . however , there is a narrow domain along the along @xmath32 axis in fig . 2 ( red color area ) where the accuracy deteriorates by about an order of the magnitude .",
    "apart from this , we can also see in fig .",
    "3 a sharp peak located at the origin where accuracy is @xmath0 . figures 4 and 5 depict these areas of the plots magnified for the real and imaginary parts , respectively .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the worst accuracy @xmath0 is relatively close to the limitation at double precision computation .",
    "furthermore , since the corresponding areas are negligibly small as compared to the entire inner circle area , where the approximations and are applied , their contribution is ignorable and , therefore , does not affect the average accuracy @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the computational test reveals that the obtained accuracy at double precision computation for the complex error function is absolutely consistent with _ cernlib _ , _ libcerf _ and _ roofit _ packages ( see the work @xcite for specific details regarding accuracy of these packages ) .",

    "this work is supported by national research council canada , thoth technology inc . and york university .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the complex error function can be expressed alternatively as ( see equation ( 3 ) in @xcite and @xcite , see also appendix a in @xcite for derivation ) @xmath73 consequently , from this equation we have @xmath74dt } \\\\   & = \\frac{1}{{\\sqrt \\pi   } } \\int\\limits _ { - \\infty } ^\\infty   { { e^ { - { t^2}/4}}\\left [ { { e^{i\\left ( { x + iy } \\right)t } } + { e^ { - i\\left ( { x + iy } \\right)t } } } \\right]dt}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using the eulers identity @xmath75 where @xmath76 , from the equation it follows that @xmath77 t } \\right)dt }   = 2{e^ { - { { \\left ( { x + iy } \\right)}^2}}}\\ ] ] or @xmath78",
