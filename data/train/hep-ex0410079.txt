    "neutrinos are considered possible new messengers of the universe since their properties differ from those of photons , that currently provide most information .",
    "they could improve our understanding of the sources and mechanisms capable of accelerating cosmic rays up to energies larger than @xmath0 ev , that are observed by extensive air shower arrays .",
    "photons of energies larger than 10 tev can not bring information from distances @xmath1  mpc since they interact by pair production with background photons .    a deep connection between high energy @xmath2 emissions and @xmath3 production exists according to the model of the `` beam dump '' .",
    "protons or nuclei accelerated by an engine , interact on a gas of matter or photons .",
    "these interactions result mainly in neutral and charged pions which decay into photons and neutrinos .",
    "this explains the expectation that , if @xmath2 absorption could be ignored , observed @xmath2 fluxes and @xmath3 ones should have almost the same normalization and spectral shape .",
    "this should be a power law with spectral index around @xmath4 , as expected from fermi acceleration processes .",
    "gamma - ray experiments are currently providing interesting results and a new era for the observations above 1 tev has been recently inaugurated by the hess experiment @xcite .",
    "the experiment observed tev photons from the galactic centre with 9 standard deviations in only 12 h of observation , reconstructing a spectral index of the differential energy spectrum above 165 gev of @xmath5 , in disagreement with cangaroo @xcite .",
    "this region is extremely complicated due to the presence of sgr a@xmath6 , most probably a super - massive black hole , and of the supernova remnant ( snr ) sgr a east .",
    "the measured spectrum could be interpreted as due to purely electromagnetic processes , but also to proton acceleration and photo - meson interactions with ambient radiation or interactions with the plasma close to sgr a@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "both these last two scenarios imply high energy @xmath3 production .    from about 18 h of data ,",
    "hess estimated a similar spectral dependence than for the galactic centre for the snr rx j1713 - 3946 .",
    "the observed photon spectrum by cangaroo was pointed out to be explained by @xmath7 decay and not by electromagnetic processes @xcite , though the result has been considered controversial since the predicted spectrum seems to exceed the egret observed flux from the nearby region .",
    "the spectrum measured by hess does not show the cut - off in the cangaroo spectrum and it is compatible with egret observations .",
    "if the @xmath3 flux were equal to the one measured by hess , event rates expected in antares would be @xmath8 event / yr .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the galactic centre region is getting more and more interesting for what concerns the possibility of proton acceleration .",
    "the observation of this region can be done only from the upper hemisphere using @xmath3-induced muons , that is the topology with the best angular resolution in @xmath3 telescopes .",
    "preliminary studies show that antares will perform this observation with unprecedented angular resolution , comparable to recent and forthcoming @xmath2 experiments , such as hess , magic , integral , swift and glast .",
    "these experiments will provide alerts in case of bursting sources , such as gamma - ray bursters ( grbs ) , and clues to select interesting candidates in order to enhance antares sensitivity .",
    "other galactic sources , such as fast rotating neutron stars in snrs , plerions , associations of stars , and magnetars , are foreseen to predict up to hundreds of muon neutrino events in a cubic - kilometer detector and a few events in antares ( for a review see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "antares effective area for muons reaches 0.05  km@xmath9 for @xmath10  gev .",
    "the most promising models are already constrained by the amanda - ii limits @xcite .",
    "this is the case of the micro - quasar model in @xcite for what concerns the persistent source ss433 , though this peculiar source is surrounded by a nebula and hence the model could be particularly uncertain .",
    "extragalactic sources , such as active galactic nuclei and grbs , if transparent to nucleons , can produce event rates up to from a few to a few hundreds of events in a km@xmath11 telescope . as a matter of fact ,",
    "if the neutrons can escape sources and produce the uhe protons observed by extensive air shower arrays above @xmath12 ev , an upper limit can be derived as firstly shown in @xcite ( hereafter w&b limit ) .",
    "nevertheless scenarios exist that evade the limit by considering other proton spectral dependences than @xmath13 and sources that are not transparent to nucleons ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , hereafter mpr limit ) .",
    "amanda - ii @xcite is already at the level of testing the limit for completely opaque sources in @xcite , while the w&b flux limit will be tested after 1 yr of operation of the km@xmath11 detector icecube @xcite .",
    "it is probable that neutrino detection will allow also to address the problem of the observation of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( crs ) , since these could be produced by the same processes in sources .",
    "other granted high energy @xmath3 sources should be cr interactions with the cosmic microwave background and with the galactic interstellar matter ( for the former event rates in antares are of the order of a few events per year ) .",
    "moreover , speculative top - down production processes can be envisaged , where supermassive particles or topological defects decay into neutrinos .",
    "neutrino telescopes detect the cherenkov light emitted by charged particles produced in @xmath3 interactions by 3-d arrays of optical modules ( oms ) .",
    "oms are pressure resistant glass spheres containing phototubes ( pmts ) , located in polar ice or sea / lake water depths in order to reduce the surface @xmath14 flux by orders of magnitude . from the times of pmts hit by the cherenkov light ,",
    "tracks can be reconstructed , while the amplitudes allow an energy reconstruction .",
    "neutrino telescopes were originally optimized to detect upward - going muons from @xmath15 charged current ( cc ) interactions .",
    "their direction of flight allows to discriminate atmospheric muons , since @xmath3s are the only atmospheric shower secondaries capable of crossing the earth . since the @xmath3 cross - sections and the @xmath14 range increase with energy , the effective target mass for @xmath3 interactions becomes larger with energy . as a matter of fact",
    ", the larger the energy the better the performances of this technique , up to a saturation that depends on the detector dimensions .",
    "moreover , for @xmath16 tev the muon has the same direction of the parent neutrino allowing to point sources .    in view of recent results on neutrino oscillations ,",
    "it is now considered important to detect other flavor neutrinos .",
    "flavor ratios at sources from meson decays , in the hypothesis that the environment density is such that all muons decay , are @xmath17  @xcite . in light of solar and atmospheric @xmath3 results and of constraints from reactor experiments ,",
    "oscillations through baselines larger than tens of kpc would lead to @xmath18 .",
    "since the @xmath3 cross section increases with energy , cc interactions during propagation through the earth prevent @xmath15 and @xmath19 from reaching the detector ( unless for @xmath15 the muon range is larger than the distance of the @xmath3 vertex to the detector ) .",
    "the earth shadowing becomes important above 1 pev and neutrinos can reach the detector only from the horizon or from the upper hemisphere .",
    "hence for uhe @xmath3 detection it is necessary to have good efficiencies in reconstructing horizontal events , to use energy estimators to suppress the atmospheric @xmath14 background , and discriminate showering events inside the instrumented region from crossing atmospheric @xmath14 tracks .",
    "the case of tau @xmath3s is peculiar : they are never absorbed during propagation through the earth , though they loose energy , since they regenerate in @xmath20 decays @xcite .",
    "they can produce background free topologies , such as the double bang events , where the shower from the @xmath3 vertex and the shower from the electronic and hadronic @xmath20 decay channels are connected by a @xmath20 track , long enough to separate the showers .",
    "these interesting events , that would prove @xmath3 oscillations in an astrophysical beam , are expected to be very rare , depending on the assumed spectrum , due to the fact that a @xmath20 track is @xmath21  m for @xmath22  pev ) .",
    "the antares collaboration was formed in 1996 and comprises physicists , astronomers , engineers and sea experts from france , germany , italy , the netherlands , russia , spain and the united kingdom .",
    "the installation of the detector has started in a 2.5 km deep site about 40 km off - shore toulon ( @xmath2350n,@xmath2410e ) .",
    "the set - up of the telescope is shown in fig .",
    "twelve lines form an octagon with average distances of about 65  m. being 450 m high , they are kept taut by buoys at the top end and by anchors at the bottom .    [",

    "antares will observe the southern hemisphere sky using neutrinos .",
    "it will complement the detectors at the south pole and represents an important step to acquire the proper know - how to deploy a km@xmath11 kilometer detector in the mediterranean .",
    "the first line of the detector is planned to be deployed and connected to the junction box in the summer of 2005 . in the meanwhile , two more lines will be deployed .",
    "the milom combines a storey with optical modules , calibration devices ( laser , led beacons and acoustic positioning modules ) , and instruments for the monitoring of optical and mechanical environment of the site .",
    "the so - called line zero , with 25 storeys but no pmts inside glass spheres , will allow to realistically test the electro - mechanical cables and all the containers .",
    "the assembly and test of both lines will validate the final line integration procedure ."
