    "the problem of determining the self - consistent mean - field ( mf ) state of an interacting electron system is generally equivalent to minimizing the ground - state energy function @xmath6 with respect to an assumed order - parameter set @xmath7 .",
    "however , it may happen that when this set is expanded to include an additional component , the original self - consistent fixed point turns out to be a local maximum with respect to this new direction in order - parameter space .",
    "in other words , the original self - consistent fixed point actually represents , in such a case , a saddle point in the expanded order - parameter space .",
    "this is precisely the fate of the antiferromagnetic ( af ) state of the doped hubbard model with nearest - neighbour ( nn ) hopping @xmath8 .",
    "the self - consistent af state is described by the gap parameter @xmath9 , related to the sublattice magnetization @xmath10 in the @xmath11 direction by @xmath12 .",
    "this state was found to be unstable with respect to a new direction represented by the transverse component @xmath13 .",
    "inclusion of the transverse magnetization @xmath14 amounts to spin twisting away from the perfect af alignment , and the above instability is , in fact , towards the so - called spiral state,@xcite characterized by an ordering wave vector @xmath15 , different from the af wave vector @xmath16 .",
    "the spiral state is stabilized by an energy gain ( for the doped system ) resulting from an activation of the o(@xmath8 ) hopping due to the slight twisting of neighbouring spins relative to the af alignment . in terms of the deviation @xmath17 from the af wave vector ,",
    "the twist - induced hopping energy gain @xmath18 was found to compete with the twist - induced exchange energy loss @xmath19 , resulting in an optimum spiral pitch for a given doping concentration .",
    "thus , minimization of @xmath6 , after expanding the order - parameter set to include the transverse component @xmath20 ( or equivalently the spiral wave vector @xmath15 ) , results in a fundamentally new self - consistent fixed point .    in this paper",
    "we show that for a _ positive _ next - nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) hopping term @xmath0 in the hubbard model ( see eq . 1 for our convention ) , the above instability is strongly suppressed for _ hole doping _ , and the self - consistent af state of the doped @xmath21-hubbard model becomes stable for a range of doping concentration.@xcite however , for negative @xmath0 and hole doping , we find that while the af state survives longitudinal perturbations in the order parameter , it remains unstable with respect to transverse perturbations for any doping . to the extent",
    "the @xmath21-hubbard model is equivalent to the three - band cu - o hamiltonian,@xcite this result is particularly relevant to doped cuprates in which af ordering is much more robust with respect to electron doping .",
    "the electron doped cuprate @xmath1 retains af order up to a doping concentration of about 12%,@xcite whereas only 2% hole concentration destroys af order in @xmath2 .",
    "since a particle - hole transformation maps the @xmath0 model and hole ( electron ) doping on the @xmath22 model and electron ( hole ) doping , the positive ( negative ) @xmath0 model and hole ( electron ) doping is appropriate to study for the electron - doped compound @xmath1 , for which a negative @xmath0 is usually assumed .",
    "more significantly , a stable af state of the doped @xmath21-hubbard model provides a microscopic realization of the _ metallic af state _ ,",

    "interestingly , we find that in the low - energy limit , the magnon damping @xmath5 .",
    "this is of relevance in the context of phenomenological theories such as the nearly af fermi - liquid theory,@xcite put forward to explain the knight shift experiments and describe the non - korringa temperature dependence of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate in doped cuprates .    the need for more realistic microscopic models which include nnn hopping etc .",
