    "bak , tang , and wissenfeld ( btw ) introduced the concept of self - organized criticality ( soc ) and the so - called btw sandpile model as a description of power spacial and temporal correlations observed in a wide range of natural phenomenon @xcite . during the past two decades , more sandpile models were introduced by different variations of the main paradigm of soc , the btw model , in order to gain more realistic models .",
    "these models differ in some properties such as : discrete or continuous height variable , abelian or non abelian toppling rule , stochastic or deterministic toppling rule , directed or non directed ( or even non directed on average ) toppling current , sticky or non - sticky grains , and etc .",
    "we now have a large number of different sandpile - like models each model having it s own set of critical exponents .",
    "the number of these models are exceeding but after about two decades , a little is known about their universal classification . although some numerical studies are done to address the universality of the critical behavior of different sandpile models but these studies are in contradiction with each other .",
    "for example manna s classification @xcite is in contrast with ben - hur and biham s @xcite one , and the latter is in contradiction with chessa _",
    "@xcite classification .",
    "also more recently fixed energy sandpiles ( fes ) are introduced in order to study the critical behavior of soc and classifying sandpile models which has not gained any serious success yet and even it does not seem to be a successful career ( for example see @xcite ) .",
    "the first classification was done by manna .",
    "he put his model and the btw model in the same universality class ascribing the observed difference in critical exponents to finite size effects @xcite .",
    "this result was verified by grassberger and manna @xcite .",
    "another effort was done by daz - guilera and corral based on renormalization group which resulted in classifying btw and zhang model in the same class @xcite ( which confirmed zhang s conjecture @xcite ) .",
    "ben - hur and biham @xcite studied the most complete set of critical exponents @xmath0 , based on the evolution of conditional expectation values ( see christensen _ et al . _ @xcite ) .",
    "these exponents are related to : ( s ) the size of an avalanche , ( a ) the area of an avalanche , ( t ) the time duration of an avalanche , ( d ) the maximal distance between the origin and the sites that an avalanche cluster touches , ( r ) the radius of gyration of an avalanche cluster , and ( p ) the perimeter of an avalanche cluster .",
    "they showed that sandpile models are classified in three groups of _ non directed _ , _ non directed on average _ , and _ directed _ models @xcite . as a result of their study , btw and",
    "zhang models belong to the same universality class ( non directed ) which manna model ( as a non directed on average model ) does not and directed models belong to another class .",
    "made some systematic corrections on ben - hur and biham s method and claimed that both stochastic and deterministic sandpile models belong to the same universality class @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , bak and chen had investigated the chaotic behavior of a block - spring model ( which was introduced for simulating earthquake dynamics ) @xcite .",
    "they have shown that although the largest lyapanuv exponent of this model is zero but nearby configurations separate in a power - law manner and they called it `` weak chaos '' @xcite .",
    "based on this study , bak , tang , and chen ( btc ) conjectured that soc takes the system to the border of chaos .",
    "they also argued that this behavior is not because of exponential sensitivity to initial conditions but the critical fluctuations of the system .",
    "they conjectured that in this manner , `` weak chaos '' is another aspect of the criticality of the attractor so the `` weak chaos '' exponent _ is _ a characteristic exponent of the system @xcite .",
    "although vieira and lichtenberg found a counter example for btc s conjecture @xcite , we have numerically checked it for different sandpile models .",
    "we have shown that btc s conjecture is truly verified in btw ( also in cbtw ) and zhang models but it s not true in manna stochastic model .",
    "dhar - ramaswamy directed model behaves more complicated with at least two different regimes .    in this paper",
    "we first define some sandpile models and discuss the time evolution of nearby points in their configuration space .",
    "we will finally discuss the same behavior in the off critical regime .",
    "we have studied sandpile models on two dimensional square , triangular , and honeycomb lattices .",

    "this height variable could be interpreted as `` energy '' . at each time step ,",
    "sand is added to a randomly chosen site .",
    "whenever the height of a site @xmath2 , exceeds the critical height @xmath3 , the site would relax through the related toppling rule .",
    "relaxation of a site would cause other sites to become unstable so they would topple and a chain reaction called an avalanche continues until all sites become stable .",
    "the rate of energy injection is so slow that an unstable configuration will relax before next grain is added .     for btw model on three different lattices on log scale for @xmath4 and 10000 samples .",

    "deviation from `` weak chaos '' behavior is also seen in this model .",
    "it seems that the stochastic property is responsible for transition from `` weak chaos '' to `` very weak chaos '' behavior .",
    "since `` weak chaos '' is not observed in all sandpile models , particularly in manna model , self - organized criticality is not necessarily accompanied by `` weak chaos '' .",
    "therefore btc s conjecture seems not to be correct in general .",
    "since the `` weak chaos '' exponent of btw and zhang deterministic models do not depend on the lattice geometry , it may be considered as a universal property of these models and it may be viewed as a characteristic exponent ( table [ tbl ] ) .",

    "static _ considerations , where we have considered a _",
    "dynamic _ property of the attractor which might cause this disagreement .    on the other hand , although the root of this behavior of manna model is not known , this classification based on the `` weak chaos '' exponent may put manna model in a different class from btw and zhang models which is consistent from this aspect with ben - hur and biham s classification @xcite but inconsistent with manna s @xcite and chessa _ et al . _",

    "all we have reported above is related to sandpile models at the critical point .",
    "what happens to this behavior getting off the critical point ?",
    "do they still show weak chaos behavior ? ( it should be noted that since we have not studied fixed energy sandpile models , off critical states here means those states which their mean energy @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the critical mean energy . )    adding bulk dissipation to sandpile models can be done using different methods . for discrete models the toppling rule is changed in some randomly chosen sites called _ dissipative sites_. if the @xmath49th site is a dissipative one , it topples when @xmath50 where @xmath51 is a positive integer . in this method dissipation",
    "is controlled by two parameters , the number of dissipative sites and @xmath51 . in continuous models",
    "there is no need of selected dissipative sites and we can impose the so called new toppling rule to all sites where @xmath51 this time is a real number , therefore dissipation is controlled only by @xmath51 . in discrete models we can also use their continuous version and add arbitrary dissipation to all sites not to impose another stochastic parameter in the system .",
    "we have used the first method for the discrete btw model and the second method for ( continuous ) zhang model .",
    "although bulk dissipation does not differ in principle from boundary dissipation , its importance is because it imposes a characteristic length in the system which destroys criticality ( for example see @xcite ) . since bulk dissipation delays some toppling events we expect the rate of divergence of nearby configurations to decrease when dissipation increases .",
    "so we do not expect off critical btw and zhang models to show `` weak chaos '' behavior .     for dissipative zhang model on square lattice for @xmath4 and 10000 samples .",
    "the critical height is one and each site dissipates @xmath52 unit of sand . in the main graph @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "the asymptotic values are @xmath57 and @xmath58 correspondingly ]    fig [ fig : disbtw ] shows that in btw model by increase of dissipation , despite the interval of lattice effects which takes more long , the exponent of weak chaos region @xmath43 decreases rapidly .",
    "this is exactly what we expect because the characteristic length rapidly becomes comparable with the system size , therefore `` weak chaos '' behavior decays .",
    "the up - left graph of figure [ fig : disbtw ] shows how rapid decrease of the exponent versus dissipation magnitude in btw model .",
    "fig [ fig : diszhang ] shows that zhang model does not behave like btw .",
    "the main graph shows the evolution of @xmath5 for @xmath52 sand unit dissipation at each site .",
    "ascribing first few steps to lattice effects , there are to regimes of power - law behavior in this model which both exponents @xmath55 and @xmath56 decrease rapidly as the magnitude of dissipation ( the characteristic length of the system ) increases .",
    "these are shown in up - left and down - right graphs of fig [ fig : diszhang ] .",
    "why two different regimes appear is steel unknown to us .",
    "our simulation results show that both btw and zhang models obey btc s conjecture except some lattice effects where manna model does not because of its stochastic property .",
    "dhar - ramaswamy directed model shows a more complicated behavior where it shows two independent regimes of power - law with an unknown regime in between .",
    "so our results contain both examples and counter - examples of btc s previous conjecture .",
    "although weak chaos exponent does not seem to be a general characteristic of sandpile models but we have found a good evidence to concern it as a test for different universal classifications of these models . by means of this test ( abelian )",
    "btw , ( non - abelian ) zhang , stochastic manna , and directed dhar - ramaswamy models all seem to belong to different universality classes ( where non of the offered classifications are in a complete accordance with ) .",
    "we have also shown that as we tend to off critical states , weak chaos behavior seems to disappear were in zhang model an unknown split of @xmath5 into two power - law regimes is seen .",
