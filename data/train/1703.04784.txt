    "acoustic wave propagation in ordered granular materials has become an increasingly active area of research .",

    "recently , laser - based techniques were used to study acoustic waves in self - assembled 2d microgranular monolayers @xcite .",
    "it was shown that adhesion between the particles and between the particles and the substrate plays an important role in determining the acoustic properties of these particulate assemblies @xcite .",

    "however , the analysis @xcite was performed for a square lattice of spheres , whereas experimental studies used close - packed hexagonal microsphere monolayers @xcite .",
    "thus one objective of the present study is to extend the analysis of contact - based vibrational modes of a granular monolayer on a substrate onto the case of a hexagonal lattice .",
    "we will see that the behavior of contact - based modes propagating in a high symmetry direction of a hexagonal lattice is qualitatively similar but quantitatively different compared to the square lattice case .",
    "our further objective is to analyze intrinsic spheroidal vibrations in a microgranular monolayer .",
    "such spheroidal vibrations have been experimentally observed in both 3d @xcite and 2d @xcite microgranular assemblies .",
    "we employ a perturbation approach to study the effects of particle - particle and particle - substrate contacts on the spheroidal modes .",
    "our analysis involves solving two problems : ( i ) the effect of the substrate on spheroidal modes of an individual sphere ; ( ii ) the effect of sphere - sphere contacts which transform spheroidal modes of individual spheres into collective propagating modes .",
    "the former problem was considered previously @xcite in the context of resonant ultrasound spectroscopy of macroscopic spheres .",
    "our analysis is similar to the quasi - static contact model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , we employ an efficient energy - based perturbation approach leading to a simple explicit expression for the substrate - induced frequency shift .",
    "furthermore , our analysis includes spheroidal modes with horizontal displacement at the contact point with the substrate , which were not considered in ref .",

    "<S> furthermore , we study the effect of sphere - substrate and sphere - sphere contacts on spheroidal vibrational modes of the spheres within a perturbative approach . </S>",
    "<S> the sphere - substrate interaction results in a frequency upshift for the modes having a non - zero displacement at the contact point with the substrate . </S>",
    "<S> sphere - sphere interactions result in dispersion of spheroidal modes turning them into propagating waves , albeit with a small group velocity . analytical dispersion relations for both contact - based and spheroidal modes are presented and compared with results obtained for a square lattice . </S>"
