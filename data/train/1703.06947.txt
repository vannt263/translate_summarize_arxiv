    "most of the known exoplanets have been discovered by the doppler radial velocity method @xcite or by the transit method @xcite , with the largest number coming from the kepler exoplanet transit mission @xcite . despite the large number of exoplanets discovered , our knowledge about the distribution of exoplanets by these methods is limited by the selection effects of these methods .",
    "most of these planets are hot or warm planets at small orbital ( @xmath61 au ) separation from their host stars , and the planets in wider orbits are generally more massive than saturn .",
    "microlensing is the only method that is sensitive to the low mass planets at orbital separations larger than the snow line . according to the core accretion theory of the planet formation @xcite ,",
    "the planet formation process is most efficient beyond the snowline @xcite where the protoplanetary disk is cold enough for ices to condense .",
    "this gives a higher density of solid material that can coagulate to start the planet formation process .",
    "hence , the microlensing method allows us to study the demographics of the planetary systems in the favored planetary birthplace , beyond the snow line .",
    "gravitational microlensing is the method for detecting the exoplanets with masses as low as an earth mass @xcite at a distance @xmath7-@xmath8kpc from earth .",
    "since the technique does not depend on the light from the exoplanet or its host star , it is very effective in detecting planets that orbit very faint stars , including planets orbiting stars in the galactic bulge .",
    "a number of planets with host star probably in the bulge have already been discovered , including ogle-2005-blg-390 @xcite , ogle-2008-blg-092 @xcite , ogle-2008-blg-355 @xcite , moa-2008-blg-310 lb @xcite , moa-2009-blg-319 @xcite , moa-2011-blg-262 @xcite , moa-2011-blg-293 @xcite and ogle-2014-blg-1760 lb @xcite .    to date , about @xmath950 planets have been discovered using microlensing , and 30 of these have been used to derive the exoplanet mass ratio function @xcite , which describes the occurrence rate of planets as a function of their mass ratio , @xmath10 , and separation in einstein radius units . to extend these results to find exoplanetary mass as a function of the host star mass and galactocentric distance",
    ", we must determine the planet and host star mass and their distance from earth .",
    "for most planetary microlensing light curve events we obtain the planet - host star mass ratio , separation in einstein radius , and the source radius crossing time , @xmath11 , which leads to a determination of the angular einstein radius , @xmath12 .",
    "this is not enough information to measure the host star and planet masses , but we can estimate them with a bayesian analysis using a galactic model , with the assumption that the exoplanet mass function does nt depend on the mass or distance of the host star .",
    "the masses of the planets and host star can be determined for events that include a measurement of the microlensing parallax effect @xcite or by detecting the lens in the high resolution follow up images @xcite . in some cases ,",

    "we take a second look at the exoplanetary microlensing event moa-2008-blg-310 with two epochs of _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) imaging taken in 2012 and 2014 . while the discovery paper presented excess starlight at the position of the source with vlt adaptive optics ( ao ) imaging ,",
    "our hst images allow us to determine if the star or stars responsible for this excess flux have a lens - source relative proper motion that is consistent with the lens ( and planetary host ) star .",
    "the moa ( microlensing observations in astrophysics ) group identified the microlensing event moa-2008-blg-310 on july 6 , 2008 and 2 days later issued a high magnification alert .",
    "the peak of this event and its planetary anomaly was meticulously covered by @xmath13fun ( microlensing follow up network ) in ctio @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath13fun @xmath17 and bronberg unfiltered passbands .",

    "this event was also observed using vlt / naco ao system on july 28 , 2008 , and these data showed additional @xmath16-band flux on top of the source , suggesting a possible detection of the planetary host star .",
    "however , as @xcite pointed out , it is also possible that the excess flux could be due to a companion to the source , a companion to the lens , or an unrelated star .",
    "there was no ambiguity in the interpretation of the excess flux for planetary microlensing event ogle-2005-blg-169 because the high angular resolution follow - up observations from _ hst _ and keck were able to demonstrate the lens - source relative proper motion and measure the host star flux in four passbands @xcite . in this paper",

    "the removal of these systematic error trends can sometimes modify the best fit @xmath18 and source flux , @xmath35 , values , so we thought it prudent to use the new photometry . in this case , the detrended photometry resulted in slightly different parameters , but no large change in @xmath18 or @xmath35 was seen .",

    "the difference is that @xcite just reports the scatter in the fit , while @xcite subtracts the scatter due to the photometric measurement uncertainties .",

    "each wfc3-uvis pixel subtends approximately @xmath95mas on a side .",
    "these dithered images were reduced and stacked following the methods described in @xcite .",

    "the uncertainty due to psf fitting is also included .",
    "the images in each band are reduced with correction for cte ( charge transfer efficiency ) losses using a method developed specifically for wfc3/uvis based on the algorithm described in @xcite for acs .",
    "the images are taken in a custom dither pattern that ensured the most uniform possible pixel - phase coverage for the eight exposures .",
    "we adopted the first exposure of each passbands as the reference image .",
    "the we measured the stars in this image and in all the other images with a library psf and corrected them for distortion .",
    "we then used the positions of the stars common to each exposure and the reference exposure to define a 6-parameter linear transformation from each frame into the reference frame .",
    "this allowed us to transform the location of each pixel into the reference frame , both for the purposes of stacking and for the purposes of using them as simultaneous constraints in modeling the scene .",
    "we stack all these individual images into a single frame @xcite , or stack image , for each passband and identify the target object in the stack images using the naco vlt high resolution image presented in the discovery paper @xcite , which was identified based on the location found in difference images taken near peak magnification .",
    "next we select about 23 isolated stars with a color within a 150 pixel radius of the target object that have a color similar to the target .",
    "we use these stars to do another round of mapping between different frames .",
    "the goal of this step is to generate more precise local coordinate transformations from each frame to the reference frame and to derive a more accurate psf for the target .",
    "we then use these transformations to extract the pixels in the vicinity of the target from each exposure and transform their locations into the reference frame and then solve for the effective psf @xcite appropriate for the target object .",
    "the main problem in dealing with hst images relative to ground based images is that hst images are undersampled .",
    "this means a large portion of the flux of a star falls inside one pixel . as a result , several different psf models can provide equally good fits to the data @xcite .",
    "the pixels are too wide to sample all of the information that the telescope is delivering to the detector .",
    "this is not a big problem for determining total flux using aperture photometry as long stellar images are reasonably isolated .",
    "but it is a big problem for astrometry .",
    "the degeneracy in the psf fits yields degeneracies in the positions of stars , making it imposible to measure precise stellar positions .",
    "psf fitting photometry routines designed for ground - based data , like daophot @xcite and dohpot @xcite are not designed to deal with undersampled data , and they are ill - equipped to deal with intrapixel scale detector sensitivity variations , which can be important for undersampled data . theoretically , one might attempt to deal with undersampling by separately determining the instrumental psf ( ipsf ) and the sub - pixel scale response function , but @xcite point out that it is simpler and more accurate to deal with the effective psf ( epsf ) , which is the convolution of the ipsf and the detector response , @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are intrapixel sensitivity function and ipsf respectively .",
    "we selected about 19 isolated stars within 150 pixel radius and within 0.1 magnitude color and 0.5 magnitude @xmath15 band brightness of the target star .",
    "these stars were used to build the epsf .",
    "we used all the individual images of these stars to determine the effective psf following the method of @xcite .",
    "we select a pixel region centered on each of the psf - contributing stars and divide it into a grid with a quarter pixel interval .",
    "the epsf is evaluated on these grid points , and the intermediate points are interpolated using cubic spline interpolation .",
    "the value of the epsf is the fraction of a star s light that should fall in a pixel centered on the specified coordinates .",
    "hence : @xmath104 or conversely , @xmath105 where @xmath106 are the position of the star and @xmath107 is the observed pixel value of the pixel centered at @xmath108 .",
    "the parameters @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the background flux and the the total flux of the star , respectively .",
    "we start with the total flux of the star measured by aperture photometry as @xmath110 and the centroid of the star as the position @xmath106 . for the background flux we calculated the flux between 8.5 and 13 pixels from the center of the star .",
    "the epsf is computed with an iterative procedure . in each iteration , we determine the epsf for each of those 19 stars in each individual image .",
    "then we average the epsfs of each star from all the images combined .",
    "it is this step of averaging of the epsfs from all the dithered images that helps to overcome the undersampling problem .",
    "now we use this average epsf to get a best fit of the star by minimizing : @xmath111 ^ 2\\ ] ] we do not fix the value of ( @xmath106 ) in this minimization procedure , so it yields a new set of values for star positions which is used to calculate the effective psf from equation  [ eq - pij ] in the next iteration step .",
    "this iteration procedure converged to our final epsf after 6 iterations .",
    "once we have determined our epsf model , we are ready for fit our target object with two star models , so that both the source and lens stars can be included .",
    "we also consider three star models in cases ( like this one ) where the two - star models do nt provide a good fit to the properties of the source and lens stars . our model for the total star flux distribution changes from @xmath112 for a single star to @xmath113 for the dual star model .",
    "this increases the number of model parameters by 3 , for the brightness and coordinates of the second star .",
    "the parameter @xmath114 denotes the ratio of the star-1 brightness to the total stellar brightness of both stars , so @xmath115 is the fractional brightness of the second star .",
    "the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 are the positions of the two stars .",
    "we have two different strategies for these epsf fits . for the simplest , two - star models ,",
    "we start with a simple grid search that gives us a list of @xmath27 values for all parameter sets that fall on the parameter grid .",
    "this is robust , but inefficient .",
    "it is much more efficient to use the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method , which avoids highly unlikely parameter choices .",
    "we use the mcmc method to fit @xmath118 in order to minimize the following @xmath27 for each individual image @xmath119 ^ 2 \\ .\\ ] ] the  chain \" of solutions generated with the mcmc serves as a probability distribution of parameters that we use to determine the uncertainties on the psf fit parameters .    the ra and dec of the stack images are related to x and y positions using the equations  [ eq-2012 ] and [ eq-2014 ] for 2012 and 2014 data respectively : @xmath120 @xmath121 the ra and dec are expressed in arcseconds . from these relations",
    "it is clear that the @xmath122 and @xmath123 pixel positions of lens and source are different in different frames .",
    "but the relative separation between the lens and the source is independent of the frames .",
    "each pixel is @xmath940 mas .",
    "we will be using separations in x and y pixel coordinates in this paper .",
    "the first step in our psf modeling is to do single star fits to all the stars in the frame .",
    "such fits are used for the calibration of the _ hst _ photometry presented in equations  [ eq - hst2012 ] and [ eq - hst2014 ] . aside from the calibration , we are primarily interested in the  target \" star , which is at the position of the source star ( moa-2008-blg-310s ) .",
    "since the epsf model is fixed from a fit to a set of stars with color similar to the source star , there are on three parameters that describe the epsf fit to the target star .",
    "these are the pixel position of the star in x and y and the total flux . in the 2012 epoch , the single star psf fit at the position of the target yields calibrated magnitudes of @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "similarly , the 2014 epoch images yield target magnitudes of @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "these magnitude uncertainties come from the psf fit uncertainties and the calibration uncertainties .",
    "it is clear from these magnitudes that the target object is brighter than the source , @xmath128 , and this implies that there is at least one additional star blended with the source star , as found by @xcite with ao images from the vlt .",
    "however , due to the stability of the _ hst _ psf , we can use our _ hst _ images to do photometry and astrometry of the stars that contribute to the target , even though these stars remain unresolved .",
    "the next step is to fit the target with a dual star model to see if the target can be explained as a combination of the source and lens stars .      in dual star psf",
    "fits , we expect to fit and detect the source and the lens .",
    "the source magnitudes in @xmath14 and @xmath15 bands are @xmath129 and @xmath130 respectively .",

    "these are the pixel positions of the two stars in @xmath122 and @xmath123 , and the total flux and the flux ratio between the two stars .",

    "the source flux constrained dual star fit to the 2014 data are not consistent with the blend = lens model because the measured source  blend separation is much smaller than the predicted separation between the source and lens stars , and our attempt to detect the color dependent centroid shift tends to confirm this conclusion . without a clear detection of the lens star , we can not use mass - luminosity relations to get a precise distance and masses for the host star and planet , as we have previously done for ogle-2005-blg-169 @xcite .",

    "as mentioned in section  [ sec - notlens ] , we have performed a bayesian analysis to estimate the lens system properties using the galatic model of @xcite assuming that all the stars and brown dwarfs have an equal probability of hosting a planet with the detected properties .",
    "we ran a series of markov chains with a total of 662,000 links to determine the allowed distribution of lens parameters , including the lens brightness constraint from section  [ sec - triple - psf ] , and the results of this calculation are presented in figure  [ fig - histogram1 ] and table  [ tab - params - histogram ] .",
    "the source star brightness , color and the radius for each model in the markov chain are included in this calculation .",
    "the source star is assumed to be a bulge star distributed at a distance @xmath223kpc following a standard galactic model @xcite . for each model ,",
    "the source distance is chosen randomly from the microlensing rate weighted galactic bulge distribution .",
    "we use empirical mass  luminosity relations @xcite and the mass  distance relations given in equation  [ eq - m_thetae ] to determine the lens distance , @xmath31 , the host star and the planet masses ( @xmath177 and @xmath179 ) , the host star @xmath14-band magnitude , @xmath221 , and the host star  planet projected separation , @xmath224 .",
    "the uncertainties shown in table  [ tab - params - histogram ] represent 1-@xmath136 error bars .",
    "the mass of the host star ( lens star ) is approximately determined to be @xmath225 , so it could be an m  dwarf of a brown dwarf . the predicted magnitude of the lens is @xmath226 with a 2-@xmath136 range extending down to @xmath227 .",
    "so , unless the lens brightness is near this 2-@xmath136 upper limit , it will be too faint to detect while blended with the @xmath228 source star .",
    "the planet mass is @xmath229 , with a 2-@xmath136 range of @xmath230 , so it could be a super - earth or a sub - saturn mass gas giant .",
    "the distance to the lens system is more precisely determined , due to the relatively small angular einstein radius , @xmath231mas .",
    "our analysis predicts a lens system distance of @xmath232kpc .",
    "this implies that the lens system is very likely to be in the galactic bulge , as claimed by the discovery paper @xcite , although a super - earth planet orbiting a brown dwarf in the disk can not be ruled out .    in this paper",
    "we have developed a technique for fitting a two or three star psfs to the blended _ hst _ images consisting of a microlensed source , the lens star , and possible companions to the source and lens stars , following a procedure outlined by @xcite .",
    "we have constrained these fits with constraints on the source flux and the lens  source separation from the microlensing light curve model . in our previous analysis of event ogle-2005-blg-169 @xcite ,",
    "the unconstrained best fit solution was consistent with the source flux and the predicted lens  source separation in three different passbands , as well as subsequent keck ao @xmath16-band images @xcite .",
    "since the lens  source relative proper motion is determined by the planetary signature in the light curve , the confirmation of the separation predicted by the light curve is also a confirmation of the planetary interpretation of the light curve .",
    "this confirmation was important for ogle-2005-blg-169 event due to the fragmentary character of the light curve over peak .",
    "but for moa-2008-blg-310 event , the light curve is well covered , allowing very little scope for incorrect modeling .",
    "hence we can expect to measure the relative lens - source proper motion more precisely and compare with the lens - source proper motion derived from the light curve modeling .",
    "but the event moa-2008-blg-310 did not yield a confirmation of the blend = lens model .",
    "instead , we found that the source flux constrained solutions were not consistent with the lens  source relative proper motion predicted by the light curve .",
    "the two epochs of _ hst _ data were taken in 2012 , 3.62 years after the event , and 2014 , 5.59 years after the peak magnification .",
    "the expected lens  source separations at these two observing epochs are @xmath233mas and @xmath234mas , for the 2012 and 2014 observations , respectively .",
    "the 2014 _ hst _ observations , in particular , were not consistent with the blend = lens model .",
    "the lens  source separation constrained models had a @xmath27 increase of @xmath235 compared to models , which only constrained the source flux .",
    "so , we have concluded that the blend flux , first identified by @xcite is _ not _ due to the planetary host ( and lens ) star .",
    "this conclusion is strengthened by the lack of a detectable color dependent centroid shift @xcite therefore , we consider 3-star models in order to constrain the brightness and mass of the planetary host star . in these fits , we constrain the source flux and length , but not the direction of the lens  source separation vector .",
    "as discussed in sections  [ sec - dual - psf ] and [ sec - triple - psf ] , there are two possible solutions available .",
    "one is that the lens is too faint to influence the _ hst _ image models , and the extra flux is solely due to a star that is an unrelated nearby star .",
    "the second possibility is that the lens is bright enough ( @xmath236 ) to influence the epsf fit . in this case , with two additional stars , besides the source star , contributing flux , the uncertainty on the proper motion of the blend star is much larger .",
    "so , the blend star in the 3-star fit can be either a nearby unrelated star or a companion to the source or the lens .",
    "the triple star fit does provide an upper limit of the host star mass and therefore the planet mass .",
    "this implies that the exoplanetary system is a sub saturn mass system located in the bulge orbiting around a m  dwarf star or a brown dwarf .",
    "the method that we have presented in this paper is an important development in the effort to characterize exoplanets found by the microlensing method .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to determine whether excess flux at the location of a microlensed source star is due to the lens star of a planetary microlensing event . in the case of ogle-2016-blg-169",
    ", such measurements indicated that the blend star was the planetary host star @xcite , but for moa-2008-blg-310 , we have shown that the blend star is not the lens .",
    "such measurements are possible for most planetary microlensing events because most planetary microlensing features resolve the finite angular size of the source star and predict the lens  source relative proper motion , @xmath0 which allows the test that we have performed in this paper .",
    "a few years after the microlensing event when lens has moved away from the source , the lens and source stars will be partially resolved .",
    "then , the analysis of the high resolution images of the partially resolved lens  source system will allow us to detect the lens ( and planetary host star ) and determine its mass and that of its planet .",
    "the method presented in this paper allows us to determine if any excess flux is actually due to the host star .",
    "this characterization of planetary systems discovered by microlensing is important because microlensing is unique in its sensitivity to the cold low ",
    "mass exoplanets beyond the snowline , where other exoplanet detection methods are not so effective .",
    "but the light curve analysis of most planetary microlensing events yields only the planet ",
    "host star mass ratio and separation in einstein radius units .",
    "more observations like the ones we have analyzed in this paper of moa-2008-blg-310 and those of ogle-2005-blg-169 @xcite will allow us to expand the current state of the art analysis of exoplanet statistics beyond the snow line @xcite to include the dependence of the exoplanet mass function on the host mass and distance .    the analysis we have presented here confirms the prediction @xcite that such measurements should be possible for virtually all planets found by a space - based microlensing survey . in fact , this method is likely to to be the primary method for determining planet and host star masses for exoplanets discovered by the wfirst exoplanet microlensing program @xcite .",
    "the advantage of a space - based microlensing survey is that the wfirst observations themselves will provide the high angular resolution observations needed to detect the exoplanet host stars . however , the wfirst fields will be more crowded than the fields of ogle-2005-blg-169 or moa-2008-blg-310 , in part because wfirst will observe in the infrared .",
    "hence the probability of blending by unrelated stars will be higher .",
    "thus , it will be more important to distinguish lens from unrelated blend stars and companions to the source and lens .",
    "therefore , it will be necessary to use the method developed in this paper to avoid errors in determining the host star brightness , mass and distance . about @xmath237 of g ",
    "dwarfs have stellar companions as do 26% of k and m  dwarfs @xcite .",
    "so stellar companions will be a common source of contamination in the attempt to identify host stars for planets discovered by the wfirst microlensing program .",
    "with wfirst it will be more the rule than the exception to have source , lens and an additional stellar companion that is faint . hence getting the excess flux",
    "is probably not enough in wfirst era , we will have to follow a more careful investigation , like moa-2008-blg-310 follow up analysis .",
    "thus , the methods that we have developed in this paper are an important step forward in the development of the wfirst exoplanet mass measurement method that will measure the demographics of cool and cold exoplanets .",
