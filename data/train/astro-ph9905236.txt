    "for many nuclear equations of state , the surface of a neutron star is expected to lie within the marginally stable orbit - the radius within which no stable circular orbits exist within general relativity ( kluniak & wagoner 1985 ) . thus , under certain conditions , the marginally stable orbit should be dynamically important in determining the accretion flow onto an accreting neutron star .",
    "the millisecond quasiperiodic oscillations ( khz qpos ) discovered ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; van der klis et al .",
    "1996 ) with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte )",
    "( bradt , rothschild , & swank 1993 ) in the x - ray emission of neutron star x - ray binaries are likely produced by motion in the inner accretion disk with the qpo frequency related to the inner disk radius .",
    "recently , it has been suggested that the behavior of the khz qpos for certain systems provides evidence for the existence of marginally stable orbit ( kaaret , ford , & chen 1997 ; zhang , strohmayer , & swank 1997 ) .",
    "the best evidence has come from the binary 4u  1820 - 30 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998a ) .",
    "two simultaneous khz qpos are detected from 4u  1820 - 30 ( smale , zhang , & white 1997 ; zhang et al .",
    "both the upper and lower qpo peak vary in frequency , but maintain an approximately constant frequency separation .",
    "zhang et al.(1998a ) found that below a certain count rate , the frequency centroids of both the upper and lower qpo peaks are correlated with count rate , while above that count rate , the qpo frequencies are roughly constant and are independent of count rate .",
    "saturation of qpo frequency at high mass accretion rates had been suggested as a signature of the marginally stable orbit ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 ; kaaret et al.1997 ) .",
    "a key question is whether the x - ray count rate is a good indicator of the mass accretion rate and whether it is robustly correlated with the qpo frequency . in general , x - ray count rate is not a good indicator of mass accretion rate ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) .    here , we present new observations of 4u  1820 - 30 made simultaneously with rxte and bepposax and a new analysis of archival rxte observations .",
    "the new data show that the qpo frequency is not robustly correlated with x - ray count rate in 4u  1820 - 30 .",
    "thus a better indicator of mass accretion rate is required .",
    "we use energy flux and x - ray spectral shape as indicators of mass accretion rate .",
    "below , we first discuss the observations and analysis . we then present correlations between the qpo frequency and various indicators of mass accretion rate .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the results .",
    "we performed two joint bepposax / rxte observations of 4u  1820 - 30 , on 1998 april 17 - 18 and 1998 september 19 - 20 , for a total of 100  ks of on - source observing time in each of bepposax and rxte .",
    "we also reanalyzed the rxte observations described in smale et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and zhang et al .",
    "( 1998a ) .    for the timing analysis ,",
    "@xmath0s time resolution event data from the rxte proportional counter array ( pca ) were used . to search for fast qpos",
    ", we performed fourier transforms on 2  s segments of data with no energy selection and summed the 2  s power spectra within each observation interval .",
    "the total power spectrum for each interval was searched for qpo peaks above 200  hz by fitting a function , consisting of a lorentzian plus a constant , for each trial frequency . only qpo peaks with a chance probability of occurrence of less than 1% as determined from an f - test were retained .    for the rxte - only analysis , presented in figs .",
    "[ qpo_rate ] , [ qpo_flux ] , [ qpo_hc ] , and [ hc_flux2 ] , we divided the data into continuous segments with lengths near 1000  s. in some cases several 1000  s of data were combined to allow detection of weaker qpos . for each interval , we calculated pca count rates in various energy bands using proportional counter units ( pcus ) 0 , 1 , and 2 as these were on in all observations . as the pca response changed gradually over the 2 year span of these observations , we used fixed energy bands and interpolated the count rates within fractional channel boundaries .",
    "the x - ray colors in figs .",
    "[ qpo_hc ] and [ hc_flux2 ] were calculated from these rates .",
    "we also found 129 channel pca spectra for pcus 0 and 1 , which were used to calculate the unabsorbed energy fluxes for the 225  kev band presented in figs .",
    "[ qpo_flux ] and [ hc_flux2 ] . detailed analysis of rxte spectral variations and correlations with the qpos will be given in bloser et al.(1999 ) .",
    "for the simultaneous bepposax / rxte analysis we selected the longest continuous segments , in order to maximize the statistics in each spectrum .",
    "there are 26 simultaneous segments , for a total of 62  ks .",
    "we searched for qpos in the pca data and performed spectral analysis of the bepposax data for each segment .",
    "the spectral analysis is described in piraino et al .",
    "we chose to use a comptonization model ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 ) with an added single temperature standard blackbody component and including interstellar absorption to parameterize the spectra .",
    "for this model , the temperature , @xmath1 , and optical depth , @xmath2 , of the comptonizing electron cloud , the flux of the blackbody component , and the absorption column density , @xmath3 , are constant within errors for all the joint bepposax / rxte observation intervals ( the uncertainties quoted are the typical 90% confidence uncertainty for individual spectra ) .",
    "the values found for @xmath4 and @xmath5 are similar to those observed previously ( christian & swank 1997 ) , and the parameters of the blackbody are similar to those found in an asca observation of 4u  1820 - 30 in a low intensity state ( smale et al .",
    "1994 ) . the blackbody temperature , @xmath6 , and the total flux vary with qpo frequency as reported in piraino et al .  ( 1999 ) .",
    "using this model , we calculated the unabsorbed energy flux in the 0.3 - 40  kev band presented in fig .",
    "[ qpo_saxflux ] .",
    "zhang et al .  ( 1998a ) showed that the qpo frequency in 4u  1820 - 30 is correlated with x - ray count rate below a certain critical count rate and that the qpo frequency saturates above that count rate .",
    "this has been interpreted as evidence for the existence of the marginally stable orbit . however , a critical question , whether the x - ray count rate is a reliable estimator of the mass accretion rate through the disk ( kaaret et al .",
    "1998 ) , needs to be addressed for 4u  1820 - 30 .",
    "zhang et al .  ( 1998a ) includes observations from 1996 and 1997 , but the data which show a correlation between x - ray count rate and the lower qpo frequency come from observations which occurred within one 8  hour period in 1996 . as the qpo frequency versus count rate relation",
    "is known to change on time scales longer than days ( ford et al . 1997a ; yu et al.1997 ; zhang et al .",
    "1998b ; mendez et al .",
    "1999 ) , it is important to check this relation with additional observations .",
    "figure  [ qpo_rate ] shows the qpo frequency plotted versus pca count rate for rxte observations spanning 2 years .",
    "this plot shows both the upper frequency ( above 1000  hz ) and lower frequency ( below 850  hz ) qpos .",
    "the varying upper frequency peaks reported in zhang et al .",
    "( 1998a ) appear in the data , but have f - test values in the range 14% and , thus , are not included here .",
    "both the upper and lower qpo frequencies saturate at high count rates . below a count rate of @xmath7 , the lower qpo frequency appears correlated with count rate .",
    "however , our new data show a shift of the lower qpo frequency versus count rate relation by @xmath8 relative to the 1996 data .",
    "this shift indicates that the x - ray count rate versus qpo frequency correlation is not robust in 4u  1820 - 30 .",
    "thus , other indicators of mass accretion rate are required .",
    "[ qpo_saxflux ] shows the relation between the lower qpo frequency and the broad - band ( 0.340  kev ) unabsorbed energy flux calculated from the bepposax data .",
    "the qpo frequency appears uncorrelated with the unabsorbed energy flux at high fluxes .",
    "the same behavior is seen for the absorbed flux .",
    "as the broad - band spectral coverage of bepposax allows a reasonably reliable estimate of the total unabsorbed flux , this indicates that the break in the qpo frequency versus count rate relation is not simply due to a spectral change .",
    "we also examined the qpo frequency versus flux relation with the full rxte data set , see fig .",
    "[ qpo_flux ] . due to the pca s lack of spectral coverage below 2  kev , reliable estimates of the broad - band energy flux are not available , so we chose to calculate the unabsorbed energy flux in the 2.025  kev band from the pca data .",
    "the lower qpo frequency appears correlated with flux in observations spanning 2 years .",
    "this is in contrast to the lack of robust correlation between qpo frequency and flux in other sources ( ford et al .",
    "1997b ; zhang et al .",
    "1998b ) . in 4u  1820 - 30 ,",
    "the qpo frequency saturates at high fluxes , consistent with the signature of the marginally stable orbit .",
    "kaaret et al .  (",
    "1998 ) showed that the spectral shape at high energies , above 5  kev , correlates well with qpo frequency for the atoll sources 4u  0614 + 091 and 4u  1608 - 52 .",
    "spectral shape is also generally accepted as a good indicator of mass accretion rate in neutron - star low mass x - ray binaries based on studies of their spectra and timing noise ( e.g. hasinger & van der klis 1989 ; schulz , hasinger , & trumper 1989 ) .",
    "the ratio of counts in two energy bands , an x - ray color , can be taken as estimator of spectral shape . in fig .",
    "[ qpo_hc ] , we show the relation between qpo frequency versus a hard x - ray color , @xmath9 , defined as the ratio of counts in the 922  kev band to that in the 69  kev band and calculated from the pca data . the lower qpo frequency is well correlated with x - ray color when the spectrum is hard .",
    "there appears to be a break to constant qpo frequency when the spectrum becomes softer than a certain critical value .    to test whether the break in the qpo frequency versus hardness relation is significant , we did linear fits of the lower qpo frequency versus hard color for @xmath10 and @xmath11 . for @xmath10 ,",
    "the linear correlation coefficient is @xmath12 , corresponding to a chance probability of occurrence of @xmath13 , and the best - fit slope is @xmath14 . while for @xmath11 , the correlation coefficient is @xmath15 , which implies that an uncorrelated data set would produce a correlation coefficient of this magnitude or larger with a probability of 0.97 , and the slope is @xmath16 .",
    "we also fitted the entire data set for the lower frequency peak to two models : a line and a broken line with saturation at a maximum frequency .",
    "the @xmath17 improved with addition of the extra parameter for the frequency saturation , @xmath18 .",
    "the addition of the extra parameter is justified at a confidence level of @xmath19 .",
    "also , the slope found in the broken - line fit agrees well with the slope found from the linear fit for @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the evidence for the saturation in qpo frequency at low @xmath9 , i.e. high mass accretion rates , is highly significant when evaluated using the linear correlation coefficients , the slopes of the linear fits in the two color ranges , or the decrease in @xmath17 with the addition of saturation to the linear model .    in most of the atoll khz",
    "qpo sources studied , qpos are detected only down to some minimum hard color ( e.g. mendez 1999 ) .",
    "the qpos generally disappear near , or just beyond , a turning point in the color - flux or soft color - hard color diagram and near the cutoff the qpo frequency varies over a wide range , 200 - 300  hz . in 4u  1820 - 30 ,",
    "the qpos disappear at a hard color near 0.56 where there is a break in the color - flux relation , see fig .",
    "[ hc_flux2 ] .",
    "this is similar to the behavior seen in other sources , although the range of the qpo frequency variation near the qpo disappearance is smaller in 4u  1820 - 30 .",
    "the saturation of qpo frequency in 4u  1820 - 30 occurs at a hard color near 0.58 , significantly higher than the hard color where the qpos disappear .",
    "the saturation occurs at a position in the color - flux ( or color - color ) diagram where other khz qpo sources show a good correlation between qpo frequency and hard color , and is thus markedly distinct from the behavior seen in the other khz qpo sources .",
    "the fact that the qpo frequency saturates while the hard color continues to increase suggests that the break in qpo frequency seen in 4u  1820 - 30 is distinct from the qpo behaviors seen in other sources . because qpo frequency is well correlated with hard color in most khz qpo sources and because x - ray color is thought to be a good indicator of mass accretion rate , the break in the qpo frequency versus x - ray hard color relation strengthens the interpretation of the transition to constant qpo frequency in 4u  182030 as evidence for the marginally stable orbit .",
    "interpretation of the khz qpo data as evidence for the detection of the marginally stable orbit requires that the mechanism producing the khz qpos have a frequency which increases monotonically as the inner disk radius decreases .",
    "keplerian orbital motion , sub - keplerian orbital motion , perhaps due to radiation pressure , or coherent phenomena , such as sound waves or disk oscillations modes , would all give the requisite dependence of qpo frequency on inner disk radius .",
    "in any of these cases , the sharp break in the mass accretion rate dependence of the qpo frequency in 4u  1820 - 30 requires a correspondingly sharp break in the dependence of inner disk radius on mass accretion rate .",
    "the transition in qpo behavior versus x - ray hard color shown in fig .",
    "[ qpo_hc ] occurs over an interval only slightly larger than the typical accuracy of the hard color measurements .",
    "thus , the break must occur over a narrow range in mass accretion rate .",
    "a change in disk structure could produce a change in the dependence of qpo frequency on mass accretion rate ( zhang et al .",
    "however , it is unlikely that a change in disk structure would produce a change to a fixed inner disk radius that then remains constant as the mass accretion rate continues to increase .",
    "it is possible that the break is due to some special orbital radius other than the marginally stable orbit .",
    "ghosh ( 1998 ) recently discovered an accretion disk instability that occurs in a fixed annulus covering radii of @xmath20 for a neutron star mass @xmath21 .",
    "however , the instability is important only for gas pressure dominated disks , and is unlikely to be important for 4u  1820 - 30 as the mass accretion rate is of order 0.1 of the eddington rate , and thus the disk is likely radiation pressure dominated .",
    "an alternative explanation , that the accretion disk is terminated at the neutron star surface , is rejected because the high coherence , @xmath22 , of the qpos requires a life time for the phenomena producing the qpos of at least 30 orbital or rotational cycles .",
    "any spatially localized or coherent phenomena at the inner edge of the disk would be rapidly disrupted by the viscous stress and magnetic fields at the neutron star surface if the disk is terminated at the stellar surface ( miller et al .",
    "thus , the observed coherence could not be maintained .",
    "another alternative explanation , that the mass accretion rate independent qpo frequency is the spin frequency of the neutron star , is rejected because , based on the persistent emission and x - ray burst qpos detected from other atoll sources , the spin frequency of 4u  1820 - 30 is most likely within a few 10  hz of the qpo difference frequency of 270  hz .",
    "the qpo frequency above the critical mass accretion rate is not constant , but appears to vary over a fractional range ( for the upper qpo ) of approximately 5% .",
    "analysis of accretion disk flow across the marginally stable orbit ( muchotrzeb 1983 ; muchotrzeb - czerny 1986 ) shows that if the inner disk radius is driven near the marginally stable orbit , then the inner disk radius varies over a range consistent with the observed qpo frequency variations ( kaaret et al .",
