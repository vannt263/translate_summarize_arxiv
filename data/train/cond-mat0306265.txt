    "analysis of a large number of pulses shows a gaussian distribution of peak heights with a mean value consistent with the expected electronic energy loss , confirming each peak as a single ion impact event . to ensure that no ions enter the substrate without detection the noise level must be kept significantly below the mean pulse height .",
    "we have been able to reduce the effective noise level to an energy equivalent of @xmath01 kev and expect that below 0.2 kev should be attainable , providing greater than 99% confidence that all implanted ions have been detected .    at present",

    "such a yield is sufficient for proof - of - principle experiments on one - qubit devices , however , for large - scale qubit arrays it will be necessary to direct each ion to its appropriate array site using a focused ion beam ( fib ) .",
    "we are currently developing this technology using a dual beam fib / sem with a 20 nm focus .",
    "because the path taken through the substrate by each implanted ion is different , there will be variation in the spatial configuration of each @xmath3 pair , which must be corrected for by appropriate calibration of the @xmath19- and @xmath20-gate voltages ( defined above ) for all qubits in the device .",
    "since the qubit gate operation times are dependent on both the @xmath8 donor spacing and the barrier gate voltage @xcite , the @xmath19-gate can be used to tune individual qubits over a wide range of spacings .    to estimate the spacings in our test devices",
    "we have used an implant modeling package @xcite to calculate the expected ion straggle . for 14 kev @xmath12 ions incident on a silicon substrate with a 5 nm sio@xmath6 gate oxide",
    "we find that the ions come to rest 20 nm below the free surface , with a standard deviation of 10 nm in the beam direction and 7 nm in the lateral direction .",

    "the process flow proceeds as follows .",

    "we note that for the fabrication of test devices with large numbers of p atoms , single ion counting was not required as the cluster size could be determined sufficiently accurately from the incident ion flux and resist - aperture diameter .    to provide sub-20 nm registration between all features on the device , ebl is then used to pattern a number of ti / pt alignment markers on the chip . in a second ebl step ,",

    "phosphorus ions which pass through the apertures and enter the substrate come to rest at a mean depth of 20 nm below the free surface , as stated above .",
    "damage to the substrate caused by the implant process must next be removed via a thermal treatment .",

    "given a capability to implant controlled numbers of donors into silicon devices with nanoscale gates there do not appear to be any fundamental limits posed by fabrication technologies for scale - up of this architecture to many qubits .",
    "for example , long linear arrays of charge qubits can be envisaged @xcite with `` cphase '' coupling as in fig .",
    "such devices would require a focused phosphorus ion beam combined with an ebl - defined resist aperture mask to position each dopant at the appropriate array site in a step - and - repeat process .",
    "some device - related issues still require further experimental work before si : p qubit operation can be demonstrated .",
    "for example , it will be necessary to minimise defects at the si / sio@xmath22 interface which could trap the sole electron in the qubit .",
    "interface trap densities below @xmath63 have been reported @xcite that correspond to trap spacings in excess of 300 nm , sufficient for qubit operation , however , such interfaces require high levels of purity during oxide growth . also , to ensure that only the intended phosphorus ions enter the device during implantation , the detector dark currents must be further reduced .",
    "we are currently incorporating @xmath64- and @xmath23-doped wells below the detector electrodes to create a @xmath64-@xmath9-@xmath23 structure for this purpose .    the key factor determining the limit to scale - up will be decoherence of the qubits due to environmental coupling . successful operation of quantum devices is contingent on coherence times remaining longer than the time required for arbitrary rotations .",
    "the primary sources of decoherence for the charge qubit are expected to include phonons , johnson noise from the gates and charge noise from the material environment .",
    "a recent calculation of la phonon induced decoherence on the @xmath3 system @xcite concluded that for donor separations of 25 nm and greater , @xmath65 is of order @xmath16s , well above the gate operation times .",
    "similarly , johnson noise due to fluctuations on the @xmath20 and @xmath19 gates is also calculated @xcite to give decoherence on timescales @xmath01 @xmath16s .",
    "the 1/@xmath66 noise resulting from charge fluctuations in the surrounding environment is believed to be the limiting factor for all charge - based qubits @xcite .",
    "in particular , individual charge traps can produce sudden and large changes in the noise signal at random times ( random telegraph signals ) .",
    "ensemble coherence times of @xmath67 @xmath0 1 ns have been observed in gaas quantum dots @xcite suggesting a lower bound for the single particle coherence time of @xmath68 @xmath69 1 ns . in comparison with the buried si : p charge qubit , these lithographically - defined gaas devices were quite large - approximately 0.02 @xmath16m@xmath34 in area with around 25 electrons per dot .",
    "we therefore expect the quantum coherence time for the si : p charge qubit to be long enough to allow coherent control of devices such as in fig .",
    "3 .    the use of high quality materials with low trap densities should also extend the coherence time , while refocusing pulse techniques can minimise the effects of decoherence @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xmath70 may be increased by defining the logical states in terms of de - localised symmetric and anti - symmetric wavefunctions . since the delocalised states have a very similar charge distribution they will be less vulnerable to environmental charge fluctuations @xcite , although charge readout will be more difficult in this case .",
    "prior to coherent gate operations two key experiments will be undertaken .",
    "controlled tunneling between clusters of phosphorus donors must first be demonstrated with set readout to ascertain the signal level corresponding to single electron transfer .",
