    "endohedral fullerenes @xmath0@c@xmath3 , where the atom @xmath0 is encapsulated inside the hollow interior of the carbon cage c@xmath3 , are of the highest interest and importance both to the basic and applied sciences and technologies , as new modern building blocks of materials and devices with unique properties .",
    "therefore , they have attracted much attention of many investigators in recent years . in particular , the photoionization , as a basic phenomenon in nature , of atoms @xmath0 in carbon fullerenes @xmath0@c@xmath3 has become a topical research subject both for theorists for some years now ( see a review paper  @xcite as well some latest works  @xcite on the subject and references therein ) and , since only very recently , experimentalists  @xcite . among the performed photoionization studies of thus confined atoms , only works  @xcite have provided the initial understanding of how the photoionization spectrum of an atom could be modified by the environment of a negatively charged carbon cage c@xmath1 .",
    "the understanding was exemplified by trends in photoionization of the innermost @xmath8 subshell of ne in ne@c@xmath1 with various @xmath6 s .",
    "however , how these and other possible trends might show up , as general phenomena , in spectra of intermediate and outer subshells of atoms @xmath0 in @xmath0@c@xmath1 has remained unstudied .",
    "the present paper expands further the investigation started in  @xcite to the intermediate @xmath12 and outermost @xmath9 subshells of the confined ne with the aim to reveal which new aspects of these spectra of endohedral anions are most interesting , as general phenomena .",
    "following previous works , see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein , the neutral c@xmath3 cage is modelled by a short - range attractive spherical potential @xmath13 of inner radius @xmath14 a.u .",
    ", depth @xmath15 ev and finite thickness @xmath16 a.u . @xmath17 a neutral endohedral fullerene @xmath0@c@xmath3 is formed by placing the atom @xmath0 at the center of the cage . for small sized , compact atoms @xmath0 there is no charge transfer to the cage , so that the confined atom @xmath0 retains the general structure of the free atom @xmath0 .",
    "alternatively  @xcite , an endohedral anion @xmath0@c@xmath1 is modelled by the sum total of the potential @xmath18 and the coulomb potential @xmath19 of an excessive negative charge on the cage c@xmath3 .",
    "assuming that the charge @xmath6 is uniformly distributed over the entire outer surface of c@xmath3 , @xmath20 next , the sum total of these two potentials is added to nonrelativistic hartree - fock ( hf ) equations for a free atom .",
    "solutions of these new hf equations , i.e. , electronic energies and wavefunctions of the confined @xmath0 atom , are used in well - known expressions for @xmath2 photoionization amplitudes , angle - differential and/or angle - integrated @xmath2 photoionization cross sections , _ etc . _ , for free atoms ; see  @xcite for the latter . to account for interchannel coupling in the photoionization of a confined atom , the _ random phase approximation with exchange _ ( rpae ) @xcite is utilized to meet the aim .",
    "this is because rpae , which uses a hf approximation as the zero - order approximation , has proven to be a very reliable methodology over the years .",
    "accordingly , for the sake of `` theoretical '' consistency , hf values of ionization thresholds of free and confined ne atoms are used in the present study .",
    "rpae calculated photoionization cross sections @xmath10 of ne in variously @xmath6-charged ne@c@xmath1 are displayed in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "corresponding photoionization cross sections @xmath21 and @xmath22 are depicted in figure [ fig2 ] . in these calculations , interchannel coupling in the atom was accounted for at an intra - shell approximation level , as the first step in the study .",
    "one can see that , above the @xmath9 threshold @xmath23 ev of ne in _ neutral _",
    "ne@c@xmath24 ( i.e. , to the right of a vertical line marked with @xmath25 ) , all @xmath10 s oscillate about the @xmath9 photoionization cross section of free ne , as do @xmath21 above @xmath26 ev and @xmath22 above @xmath27 ev , respectively .",
    "the oscillations are due to the interference between the outgoing @xmath2 photoelectron wave and those scattered off the confining potential of c@xmath1 .",
    "when the constructive interference occurs , there emerge maxima , i.e. , resonances in @xmath5 s , termed confinement resonance  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , one can see that confinement resonances in _ all _ @xmath5 s are nearly @xmath6 independent above related @xmath4 thresholds ( previously  @xcite , the same was noted in the @xmath28 spectrum of ne in ne@c@xmath1 ) .",
    "this is because the energy @xmath29 of an outgoing @xmath2 photoelectron in any charged ne@c@xmath1 exceeds by far the coulomb potential barrier of the charged carbon cage , at @xmath30 .",
    "this is clearly seen in figure  [ fig3 ] where direct ( hartree ) parts of the potentials `` seen '' by the @xmath29p and @xmath29s photoelectrons ( due to the @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath29p , @xmath29s transitions ) are displayed .",
    "hence , the presence of the coulomb potential barrier is inconsequential for the outgoing @xmath2 photoelectrons at photon energies @xmath30 .",
    "correspondingly , at @xmath30 , confinement resonances in any @xmath2 photoionization spectrum of the encapsulated atom will chiefly be governed by details of the confining potential well @xmath18 , equation ( [ eqvc ] ) , as in neutral ne@c@xmath3 .",
    "thus , the resonances will nearly be @xmath6-independent .",
    "we term such confinement resonances as _ conventional confinement resonances_.     photoionization cross section of ne in ne@c@xmath1 for @xmath25 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 as well as for free ne , as marked .",

    "width=302 ]    to conclude , the above results reveal , and the given explanation proves , that _ conventional _ confinement resonances in photoionization cross sections of inner , intermediate and outer subshells of an atom @xmath0 in @xmath0@c@xmath1 appear to be almost @xmath6-independent .",
    "this is an interesting general phenomenon .",
    "another important observation ( see figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] ) is that conventional confinement resonances vanish quite rapidly with increasing photon ( or photoelectron ) energy .",
    "this is in line with a theory of scattering of particles off a potential well / barrier . indeed , starting at a sufficiently high energy of the outgoing photoelectron",
    ", the coefficient of reflection of the latter off a finite potential well / barrier decreases with increasing energy of the electron . as a result , the interference effect between the outgoing and scattered off the potential well / barrier photoelectron waves weakens , with increasing energy of the electron , and so are the associated conventional confinement resonances . in",
    "further , we will term this reasoning as `` conventional thinking '' .",
    "above , trends in the ne @xmath2 photoionization cross sections of ne@c@xmath1 were considered at photon energies @xmath58 beyond the corresponding @xmath4 thresholds of ne in neutral ne@c@xmath3 .",
    "we now turn the attention to lower photon energy ( @xmath7 ) parts of figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] ( to the left of the @xmath25 marked line ) . there , the additional resonance in each of @xmath10 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 of ne@c@xmath1 is seen to emerge .",
    "it owes its existence to the coulomb potential @xmath59 , equation  ( [ eqvq ] ) , of the charged carbon cage .",
    "the @xmath59 potential brings up the coulomb potential barrier at the outer surface of c@xmath3 .",
    "this engenders reflection of the low - energy continuum photoelectron wave from the coulomb barrier causing additional resonances one of which is depicted in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] at photon energies under discussion .",
    "originally , the emergence of this kind of a resonance was noted in the ne @xmath8 photoionization of ne@c@xmath1  @xcite , where it was named _",
    "coulomb confinement resonance _ , in view of its association with the coulomb potential barrier of the charged carbon cage .",
    "the present paper establishes that the phenomenon emerges in the photoionization of intermediate and outer subshells of the encapsulated atom as well , as a general occurrence .",
    "coulomb confinement resonances appear to be @xmath6-dependent , as is clearly exemplified by depicted in figure  [ fig1 ] @xmath10 s .",
    "this is because , in this instance , the energy @xmath29 of the outgoing photoelectron is near or , generally , below the top of the coulomb potential barrier ( see , as illustration , the energy line @xmath60 ev in figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "this makes the photoionization process to be sensitive to details of the latter , and , hence , to a charged state of the carbon cage as well .    to conclude , the established co - existence of @xmath6-dependent coulomb and @xmath6-independent conventional confinement resonances in photoionization spectra of endohedral _ anions _ is an exclusive feature of these systems .",
    "in the above , the discussion was related to rpae calculated data for photoionization cross sections @xmath61 of the encapsulated ne atom which were obtained at an intra - shell interchannel coupling approximation level .",
    "however  @xcite , the effect of _ inter - shell _ interchannel coupling in the encapsulated atom may result in the emergence of new confinement resonances , termed _ correlation confinement resonances_. these resonances were previously interpreted as resonances which are induced in an outer - shell photoionization spectrum of the encapsulated atom by _ conventional confinement resonances _ in inner - shell photoionization transitions in the atom , via interchannel coupling .",
    "the earlier finding was illustrated by rpae  @xcite and recently seconded by relativistic rrpa  @xcite calculated data for the xe @xmath62 photoionization of xe@c@xmath3 where interchannel coupling between the @xmath62 and @xmath63 transitions was accounted for .",
    "however , the same effect may occur via interchannel coupling with coulomb confinement resonances as well .",
    "it may even be bigger in this case since coulomb confinement resonances dominate over conventional confinement resonances ; see figure  [ fig2 ] for the most illustrative supporting evidence .",
    "furthermore , the effect of interchannel coupling may show up strongly in an outer - shell photoionization spectrum at photoelectron energies which are thousands ev above the threshold , when interchannel coupling involves very deep inner - shell transitions .",
    "the effect is going to be strong , because at such big differences in ionization thresholds of the inner and outer subshells , photoionization transitions from the former will be strong whereas those from the latter will be week , at photon energies above the inner shell threshold . as a result , both inner - shell coulomb and conventional confinement resonances may be effectively `` funneled '' through a thousands - ev - distance to the outer - shell spectrum .",
    "however , to which extent the `` funneled '' confinement resonances may indeed perturb the outer - shell spectrum is not clear .",
    "to clarify this point , we performed rpae calculations both of the @xmath9 photoionization cross section @xmath10 and dipole photoelectron angular - asymmetry parameter @xmath64 for ne in ne@c@xmath50 , above the ne @xmath8 ionization threshold .",
    "this time , inter - shell interchannel coupling between the @xmath8 , @xmath12 and @xmath9 transitions was included in the calculations . thus obtained rpae calculated data for @xmath10 and @xmath64 for the encaged ne are depicted in figure  [ fig4 ] along with data for free ne .     (",
    "a ) : rpae calculated data for @xmath65 ( mb ) of ne in ne@c@xmath50 and free ne near their @xmath8 thresholds , respectively .",
    "rpae calculations included inter - channel coupling between transitions from the @xmath8 , @xmath12 and @xmath9 subshells .",
    "( b ) : the same as in ( a ) but for the dipole photoelectron angular - asymmetry parameter @xmath66 . ]",
    "one can see that both @xmath10 and @xmath66 for the encapsulated ne atom possess a strong sharp resonance at about @xmath67 ev which is followed by a lower but broader resonance at about @xmath68 ev . as a result , these `` encapsulated '' @xmath10 and @xmath66 differ considerably from the free ne @xmath10 and @xmath66 , far above threshold . thus , the confinement matters in this case , so that the two prominent resonances in `` encapsulated '' @xmath10 and @xmath66 _ are _ confinement resonances .",
    "the striking novelty of the above finding is that the resonances emerge far - far above where conventional thinking said they would exist . indeed , when considering confinement resonances , one normally thinks in terms of conventional confinement resonances which occur due to the interference between the directly outgoing and reflected off the confining potential photoelectron waves .",
    "however , in line with `` conventional thinking '' , as was discussed above , conventional confinement resonances fade away relative rapidly with increasing energy and do vanish far above threshold .",
    "the discovered emergence , or better say resurrection of confinement resonances in the @xmath31 photoionization spectrum of ne@c@xmath1 far above threshold implies that , in contrast to `` conventional thinking '' , a few ev deep / high confining potential well / barrier may , once again , be felt by a far - above - potential - barrier - electron .",
    "the effect may as well be called _ reemerging confinement effect _ for a high - energy scattering electron , as a general phenomenon .",
    "this general phenomenon may result in the emergence of far above threshold confinement resonances in the @xmath2 photoionization spectrum of a confined atom , as in the above discussed particular example of the ne @xmath31 photoionization of ne@c@xmath50 .",
    "the latter effect may rightly be termed as _ resurrection of confinement resonances _ effect .",
    "both the reemerging confinement and resurrection of confinement resonances effects owe their existence to inter - shell interchannel coupling in the encapsulated multielectron atom .",
    "indeed , a trial calculation for ne@c@xmath50 showed that removal of the ne @xmath8 transition ( and , thus , associated with it coulomb and conventional confinement resonances ) from rpae calculations of the ne @xmath9 photoionization leaves no traces of the two resonances in `` encapsulated '' @xmath10 and @xmath66 . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath31 photoionization spectra of the confined and free ne atoms become virtually identical far above threshold , as they previously have been thought to remain nearly identical at all high energies , on the basis of `` conventional thinking '' . hence , the resurrected confinement resonances in `` encapsulated '' @xmath10 and @xmath66 , far above threshold , are due to interchannel coupling with the conventional and coulomb confinement resonances in the @xmath28 spectrum .",
    "the latter are `` funneled '' to the @xmath31 spectrum via interchannel coupling .",
    "this appears to perturb the outer - shell spectrum of the confined atom dramatically .",
    "clearly , there is nothing particularly special about the ne@c@xmath1 system .",
    "therefore , both the reemerging confinement effect and the resurrection of confinement resonances effect are expected to appear in , and be qualitatively similar for , spectra of other endohedrally confined atoms as well . in other words , the two discovered effects step in as novel general features of spectra of endohedrally confined atoms @xmath69 the existence and significance of which has been convincingly proven in the performed study .    in conclusion , neither coulomb or conventional confinement resonances , not to mention the just discovered resurrected confinement resonances far above threshold , have been experimentally observed yet for technical reasons .",
    "we hope that the data presented herein will prompt experimentallists to look into the matter , thereby promoting such developments .",
