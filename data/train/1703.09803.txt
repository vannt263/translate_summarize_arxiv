    ", we find a travel time of @xmath10 along each of the two routes .",

    "drivers will start using the new road , reducing their travel time from @xmath10 to @xmath12 .",
    "however , as more and more drivers use the new road , their travel time will increase to @xmath13 .",
    "now , no driver will have an incentive to use the old roads , i.e. , avoiding road @xmath11 , as the travel time along those roads will be @xmath14 .",
    "thus all drivers are worse off than before , in spite of having a new road .",
    "this is the braess paradox in a nutshell : _ adding a new road to a network may make travel times worse for all .",
    "_ in both cases the equilibrium is a _ wardrop equilibrium _",
    "( i.e. , all routes used have the same travel time , and all unused routes have longer travel times ) as well as a _",
    "nash equilibrium_.    this is the simplest example of the braess paradox , introduced ( with a different example ) by braess in 1968  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "this example and some generalizations have been studied in , e.g. , @xcite . in spite of the unrealistic assumptions in the prevalent example above",
    ", the paradox has turned out to be ubiquitous and intrinsic to dynamical networks .",
    "the paradox also appears in other situations not modeling traffic flow  @xcite , see , e.g. ,  @xcite for an example involving mesoscopic electron systems , and  @xcite for an example with mechanical springs .",
    "furthermore , the paradox can be reformulated in the context of game theory .",
    "in addition , there are well documented examples of the paradox occurring in real - life traffic situations , e.g. , in seoul  @xcite and stuttgart  @xcite , see also  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the paradox has been well described also in general media , see , e.g. , @xcite and on wikipedia as well as youtube .",
    "the extensive discussion about the braess paradox makes a complete reference list impossible , see , however , @xcite . in this paper",
    "we only refer to articles directly related to the research at hand .    here",
    "we want to study the braess paradox with a more realistic nonlinear dynamics .",
    "more specifically , we want to model unidirectional traffic along roads by a macroscopic model where only densities of vehicles are considered .",
    "we believe this to be novel . in this class of models , introduced by lighthill ",
    "whitham  @xcite and richards  @xcite ( hereafter denoted the lwr model ) , vehicles , described by a density @xmath7 rather than individually , drive with a velocity determined by the density alone ; higher density yields slower speed while low density lets vehicles approach the speed limit . at a maximum density with bumper - to - bumper vehicles , traffic comes to a halt .",
    "the dynamics is well described by the nonlinear partial differential equation @xmath15 see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath16 is denoted the flux function , or , in the context of traffic flow , the fundamental diagram .",
    "it is in general a concave function that equals zero when @xmath7 vanishes and when @xmath7 equals the maximum possible road density .",
    "hyperbolic conservation laws , as equations of the type   are called , have been used to study traffic on a network , starting with holden and risebro  @xcite , see , e.g. , the book by garavello and piccoli  @xcite . related results on a game theoretic approach to network traffic through the lwr model ,",
    "see  @xcite . for general theory concerning hyperbolic conservation laws",
    "we refer to  @xcite .",
    "however , the braess paradox describes an equilibrium situation , and it is not relevant to include time variation .",
    "rather , we want to study stationary solutions where the velocity is a given function of the density of vehicles on the road . at a junction",
    ", the differential equation   will in general , if the two roads have different properties , establish a complicated wave pattern , creating waves that emanate from the junction in both directions .",
    "however , in the equilibrium situation , this can not happen , as it would create time - dependent waves .",
    "thus , we will set up the example in such a way that no waves are created at junctions .    in this paper",
    "we analyze the same simple network as described above , but with much more realistic dynamics .",
    "more general examples are of course possible using the same methods .",
    "however , calculations become more cumbersome and less transparent , and we here focus on presenting the ideas of the model , exemplified on the simple network in figures  [ fig:4roads ] and  [ fig:5roads ] . for another approach to the braess paradox , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of the braess paradox is unwanted , and one would like to take measures to prevent its occurrence . in the example in the present paper , we use the velocity of the road @xmath11 as a control parameter . by properly adjusting the speed limit on road @xmath11 , one can force the braess paradox to disappear , and make the social optimum coincide with the nash equilibrium",
    ".    this can be illustrated in the simple example in the beginning of the introduction . given a `` benevolent dictator '' who wants to reduce the total travel time and reach the social optimum",
    ", a short calculation shows that , with @xmath9 , 1750 vehicles should follow each of the routes @xmath2 & @xmath4 and @xmath5 & @xmath3 , and the remaining @xmath17 vehicles should follow the route @xmath2 , @xmath11 , and @xmath3 .",
    "although a social optimum , this situation is neither a wardrop nor a nash equilibrium .    this paper offers a framework applicable to general networks .",
    "the input is , in addition to the network itself , the length and velocity fields of each road as well as the influx .",
    "we assume that traffic is in the uncongested , or free , phase .",
    "this will prevent waves from emanating from the junctions .",
    "below , we denote @xmath18 and @xmath19^{n } \\mid \\sum_j { \\vartheta}_j \\leq 1\\}$ ] is the standard simplex in @xmath20 . the sphere centered at @xmath21 with radius @xmath22",
    "is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "two points @xmath0 and @xmath1 are connected through a network of roads . along each road",
    ", traffic is described through the lwr model  . at each junction",
    ", the total flow exiting the junction equals the incoming one , so that the total quantity of vehicles is conserved .",
    "the macroscopic description obtained solving   along each road also provides the full microscopic portrait of the network .",
    "indeed , once @xmath24 is known along the road @xmath22 connecting , say , the junction at @xmath0 to that at @xmath1 , the single vehicle leaving from @xmath0 at time @xmath25 travels along @xmath22 according to @xmath26 the travel time @xmath27 along the road @xmath2 is then implicitly defined by @xmath28 to compute @xmath27 , in general , one has first to provide   with initial and boundary data , then solve the resulting initial - boundary value problem to obtain @xmath29 , use this latter expression to solve the ordinary differential equation   and finally solve the equation  .",
    "observe that the right - hand side in the ordinary differential equation in   is in general discontinuous , nevertheless in the present setting it is well - posed , see  @xcite . in the present stationary framework ,",
    "this procedure can be pursued explicitly , as we detail below in example  [ ex : simple ] .",
    "remark that , in a stationary regime , all travel times are independent of the starting time @xmath25 .    for the above travel times to be a reliable measure of the network efficiency , it is necessary that they are independent from any particular initial data .",
    "also the standard initial - boundary value problem for   with zero initial density on the whole network is unsatisfactory , since it would give results that depend on the transient period necessary to fill the network .",
    "we are thus bound to select _ stationary _ solutions , assigning a constant inflow at @xmath0 for all times @xmath30 . moreover , to allow for stationary solutions , we also assume that the total flow incoming at any junction never exceeds the total capacity of the roads exiting that junction .    in the general lwr model  , the flux function @xmath31 is a concave function that vanishes at zero density and at @xmath32 , the maximum density .",
    "the flux has a unique maximum for some value @xmath33 . as usual",
    ", we refer to densities below @xmath34 as the uncongested , or free , phase , and for densities above @xmath34 as the congested phase . in the remaining part of the paper , to obtain stationary solutions ,",
    "we need to remain in the free phase only , so that @xmath35 $ ] throughout the network . in order to simplify the notation we will use the normalization @xmath36 for all roads .",
    "we will not make any assumptions on , or reference to , @xmath37 above this value .",
    "hence , on the flow function we pose the following assumption :    ( q ) : :    @xmath38 ; { { \\mathbb{r}}}^+)$ ] ,    @xmath39 , @xmath40 and    @xmath41 .",
    "clearly , if @xmath37 satisfies  * ( q ) * , then the speed law @xmath42 is well - defined , continuous , strictly positive and weakly decreasing , see lemma  [ lem : speed ] . as a result ,",
