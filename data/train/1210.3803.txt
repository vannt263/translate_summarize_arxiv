    "<S> basing on experimental data on irradiation - induced deformation of graphite we introduced a concept of diffuse domain structure developed in reactor graphite produced by extrusion . </S>",
    "<S> such domains are considered as random continuous deviations of local graphite texture from the global one . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the origin of domain structure and estimate the size and the degree of orientational ordering of its domains . using this concept </S>",
    "<S> we explain the well known radiation - induced size effect observed in reactor graphite . </S>",
    "<S> we also propose a method for converting the experimental data on shape - change of finite - size samples to bulk graphite . </S>",
    "<S> this method gives a more accurate evaluation of corresponding data used in estimations of reactor graphite components lifetime under irradiation . </S>"
