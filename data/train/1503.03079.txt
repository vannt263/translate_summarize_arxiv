    "globular clusters are the remnants of some of the most violent epochs of star formation in the history of the universe . the compositions of the present - day stars provide a detailed chemical inventory to probe those ancient nucleosynthesis and enrichment events . nevertheless , detailed chemical inventories for some galactic globular clusters are still relatively unknown .    only recently were the chemical compositions of a large sample of stars examined in one such cluster , @xcite .",

    "their approach ensures a uniform abundance scale for the dozens of globular clusters observed in the last decade using giraffe and uves .",
    "our analysis incorporates atomic data from more recent laboratory studies and adopts the @xcite solar abundance scale .",
    "the appeal of using updated  values is that recent laboratory studies regularly report uncertainties on absolute transition probabilities as small as 5  per cent , which is effectively negligible when compared with other sources of uncertainty .",
    "the choice of  values is irrelevant if only relative differences are of interest and if the same set of lines is employed for each star .",
    "this condition is not met since the s / n and stellar parameters vary , thus we use updated  values whenever possible .",

    "substantial differences ( @xmath12  0.05  dex ) are also present in the adopted  values of lines of na  i , si  i , sc  ii , ti  i , fe  ii , and ni  i. it is impossible to assess the exact differences since no single source of  values covers all of the lines used by @xcite  and us .",

    "we can explain some of these discrepancies in part by the different solar reference abundances , and we attribute others to the different sets of lines used and the  values of those lines . finally , the exact sets of stars observed could affect the mean values of the light elements known to vary star - by - star .",

    "anti - correlations are also present among [ o / fe ] and [ al / fe ] , [ na / fe ] and [ mg / fe ] , and [ mg / fe ] and [ al / fe ] .",

    "figure  [ teffplot1 ] demonstrates that the three lowest [ sc / fe ] ratios are found in three of the four coolest stars in our sample , signaling that these low ratios could be an artifact of the analysis .",

    "the comparable magnitudes of these values suggest that the correlated heavy element abundance ratios may not have a cosmic origin .",
    "to demonstrate this point , we perform the following test . using the values presented in table  [ atmvar ] , we adjust the  values for each star to force the individual [ eu / fe ] ratios to equal the mean [ eu / fe ] ratio .",

    "the excitation potentials of sc  ii , ti  ii , v  ii , and cr  ii lines used range from 1.08 to 4.07  ev with a median of 1.50  ev , while the excitation potentials of the heavy rare earth elements lines range from 0.00 to 1.38  ev with a median of 0.32  ev .",
    "this difference is significant . the [ sc  ii / fe ] , [ ti  ii / fe ] , [ v  ii / fe ] , and [ cr  ii / fe ] ratios are not a good control group for [ la  ii / fe ] or [ eu  ii / fe ] , as was assumed by @xcite .    we conclude that there is no compelling evidence of a cosmic origin for the correlations among pairs of -element ratios in .",
    "the detected correlations likely result from random errors in the model atmosphere parameters .",
    "we suggest that the correlations identified among literature data by @xcite may also be the result of similar random errors in the model atmosphere parameters .",
