    "in recent years there has been a growing interest in the field of fractional calculus .",
    "podlubny @xcite , samko et al .",
    "@xcite and kilbas et al .",
    "@xcite provide the history and a comprehensive treatment of this subject .",
    "many phenomena in engineering , physics , chemistry and other sciences can be described very successfully by using fractional differential equations ( fdes ) .",
    "diffusion with an additional velocity field and diffusion under the influence of a constant external force field are , in the brownian case , both modelled by the convection - dispersion equation . in the case of anomalous diffusion",
    "this is no longer true , i.e. , the fractional generalisation may be different for the advection case and the transport an external force field in @xcite . in the study",
    ", we are very interested in the fast solver for solving the initial - boundary value problem of the time - space fractional convection - diffusion equation ( tsfcde ) @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6,~\\beta\\in ( 1 , 2],~a < x < b$ ] , and @xmath7 . here , the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the order of the tsfcde , @xmath10 is the source term , and diffusion coefficient functions @xmath11 are non - negative under the assumption that the flow is from left to right .",
    "moreover , the variable coefficients @xmath12 are real .",
    "the tsfcde ( [ eq : lin ] ) can be regarded as generalizations of classical convection - diffusion equations with the first - order time derivative replaced by the caputo fractional derivative of order @xmath6 $ ] , and the second - order space derivatives replaced by the two - sided riemman - liouville fractional derivative of order @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "namely , the time fractional derivative in ( [ eq : lin ] ) is the caputo fractional derivative of order @xmath8 @xcite denoted by @xmath14 and the left - handed ( @xmath15 ) and the right - handed ( @xmath16 ) space fractional derivatives in ( [ eq : lin ] ) are the riemann - liouville fractional derivatives of order @xmath9 @xcite which are defined by @xmath17 and @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the gamma function .",
    "truly , when @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the above equation reduces to the classical convection - diffusion equation ( cde ) .",
    "the fractional cde has been recently treated by a number of authors .",
    "it is presented as a useful approach for the description of transport dynamics in complex systems which are governed by anomalous diffusion and non - exponential relaxation patterns @xcite .",
    "the fractional cde is also used in groundwater hydrology research to model the transport of passive tracers carried by fluid flow in a porous medium @xcite . though analytic approaches , such as the fourier transform method , the laplace transform methods , and the mellin transform method , have been proposed to seek closed - form solutions @xcite , there are very few fdes whose analytical closed - form solutions are available .",
    "therefore , the research on numerical approximation and techniques for the solution of fdes has attracted intensive interest .",
    "most early established numerical methods are developed for handling the space factional cde or the time fractional cde . for space",
    "fractional cde , many researchers exploited the conventional shifted grnwald discretization @xcite and the implicit euler ( or crank - nicolson ) time - step discretization for two - sided riemman - liouville fractional derivatives and the first order time derivative , respectively .",
    "then they constructed many numerical treatments for space fractional cde , refer to @xcite and references therein for details .",
    "later , chen and deng combined the second - order discretization with the crank - nicolson temporal discretization for producing the novel numerical methods , which archive the second order accuracy in both time and space for space fractional cde @xcite .",
    "even chen & deng and qu et al .",
    "separately designed the fast computational techniques , which can also reduce the required algorithmic storage , for implementing the above mentioned second order numerical method ; see @xcite for details .",
    "additionally , there are also some other interesting numerical methods for space fractional cde , refer , e.g. , to @xcite for a discussion of these issues .    on the other hand , for time fractional cde , many early implicit numerical methods are derived by the combination of the @xmath22 approximate formula @xcite for caputo fractional derivative and the first / second order spatial discretization .",
    "these numerical methods are unconditionally convergent with the @xmath23 or @xmath24 accuracy , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are time - step size and spatial grid size , respectively . in order to improve the spatial accuracy , cui @xcite and mohebbi & abbaszadeh @xcite proposed , respectively , two compact exponential methods and a compact finite difference method for a time fractional convection - subdiffusion equation so that the spatial accuracy is improved to the fourth - order .",
    "however , the methods and analyses in @xcite are only for the equations with constant coefficients .",
    "in particular , the discussions in @xcite are limited to a special time fractional convection - subdiffusion equation where the diffusion and convection coefficients are assumed to be one .",
    "in addition , some other related numerical methods have already been proposed for handling the time fractional cde , see e.g. @xcite for details .    on contrast , although the numerical methods for space ( or time ) fractional cde are extensively investigated in the past research , the work about numerically handling the tsfcde is not too much .",
    "firstly , zhang @xcite , shao & ma @xcite , qin & zhang @xcite , and liu et al .",
    "@xcite have worked out a series of studies about constructing the implicit difference scheme ( ids ) for tsfcde , however all these numerical scheme can archive the convergence with first order accuracy in both space and time from the both theoretical and numerical perspectives . moreover , liu et al .",
    "@xcite , zhao et al .",
    "@xcite , and shen @xcite had considered to solve the more general form of tsfcde , in which the first - order space derivative is replaced by the two - sided riemman - liouville fractional derivative of order @xmath27 .",
    "again , their numerical methods can not enjoy the convergence with second order accuracy in both space and time .",
    "in addition , some other efficient approaches are also developed for dealing with tsfcde numerically .",
    "moreover , most of these numerical methods have no complete theoretical analysis for both convergence and stability ; e.g. , refer to @xcite for details .",
    "traditional methods for solving fdes tend to generate full coefficient matrices , which incur computational cost of @xmath28 and storage of @xmath29 with @xmath4 being the number of grid points @xcite . to optimize the computational complexity , a shifted grnwald discretization scheme with the property of unconditional stability was proposed by meerschaet and tadjeran @xcite to approximate the space fractional cde .",
    "later , wang and wang @xcite discovered that the linear system generated by this discretization has a special toeplitz - like coefficient matrix , or , more precisely , this coefficient matrix can be expressed as a sum of diagonal - multiply - toeplitz matrices .",
    "this implies that the storage requirement is @xmath1 instead of @xmath0 , and the complexity of the matrix - vector multiplication only requires @xmath30 operations by the fast fourier transform ( fft ) @xcite . upon using this advantage , wang and wang",
    "proposed the cgnr method having computational cost of @xmath31 to solve the linear system and numerical experiments show that the cgnr method is fast when the diffusion coefficients are very small , i.e. , the discretized systems are well - conditioned @xcite .",
    "however , the discretized systems become ill - conditioned when the diffusion coefficients are not small . in this case , the cgnr method converges slowly . to remedy this shortcoming , zhao et al .",
    "have extended the preconditioned technique , which is introduced by lin et al . in the context of space",
    "fractional diffusion equation @xcite , for handling the toeplitz - like linear systems coming from numerical discretization of tsfcde @xcite .",
    "their results related to the promising acceleration of the convergence of the iterative methods , while solving ( [ eq : lin ] ) .    in this paper , we firstly derive an implicit difference scheme for solving ( [ eq : lin ] ) and then verify that the proposed scheme can archive the stability and convergence with second order accuracy in both space and time ( i.e. @xmath32 ) from the both theoretical and numerical perspectives .",
    "as far as we know , the scheme is the first one ( without extrapolation techniques ) who can have the convergence with @xmath33 . for the time",
    "marching of the scheme , plenty of linear systems , which possess different toeplitz coefficient matrices , are required to be solved .",
    "those linear systems can be solved efficiently one after one by using krylov subspace method with suitable circulant preconditioners @xcite , then it can reduce the computational cost and memory deeply .",
    "especially for tsfcde with constant coefficients , we turn to represent the inverse of the toeplitz coefficient matrix as a sum of products of toeplitz triangular matrices @xcite , so that the solution of each linear system for time marching can be obtained directly via several fast fourier transforms ( ffts ) . to obtain the explicit representation of toeplitz matrix inversion ,",
    "only two specific linear systems with the same toeplitz coefficient matrix are needed to be solved , which can be done by using the preconditioned krylov subspace methods @xcite with complexity @xmath3 .",
    "an outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec2 ] ,",
    "we establish an implicit difference scheme for ( [ eq : lin ] ) and prove that this scheme is unconditionally stable and convergent with @xmath34 order accuracy . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we investigate that the resulting linear systems have the nonsymmetric toeplitz matrices , then we design the fast solution techniques based on preconditioned krylov subspace methods to solve ( [ eq : lin ] ) by exploiting the toeplitz matrix property of the implicit difference scheme . finally , we present numerical experiments to illustrate the effectiveness of our numerical approaches in section [ sec4 ] and provide concluding remarks in section [ sec5 ] .",
    "in this section , we present an implicit difference method for discretizing the tsfcde defined by ( [ eq : lin ] ) .",
    "unlike former numerical approaches with the first order accuracy in both time and space @xcite , we exploit henceforth two - sided fractional derivatives to approximate the riemann - liouville derivatives in ( [ eq3x ] ) and ( [ eq3y ] ) .",
    "we can show that , by two - sided fractional derivatives , this proposed method is also unconditionally stable and convergent under second order accuracy in time and space .      in order to derive the proposed scheme , we first introduce some notations . in the rectangle @xmath35",
    "we introduce the mesh @xmath36 , where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 .",
    "besides , @xmath39 be any grid function .",

    "we analyze the stability and convergence for the implicit difference scheme ( [ ids1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath72 for @xmath73 , we define the discrete inner product and the corresponding discrete @xmath74 norm as follows , @xmath75 now , some lemmas are provided for proving the stability and convergence of implicit difference scheme ( [ ids1 ] ) .",

    "the invertibility of those above two circulant preconditioners introduced in ( [ eqx2x])-([eqx2xzz ] ) can be similarly archived by using theorem [ themx2 ]",

    ", the speedup is almost 14 times .",
    "meanwhile , although ` time1 ` required by algorithm [ alg2 ] with matlab s backslash for small test problems ( @xmath261 ) than ` time2 ` needed by algorithm [ alg2 ] with using the pcgs method , our proposed method is still more attractive in aspects of lower memory requirement .",
    "compared to algorithm [ alg2 ] with matlab s backslash , it highlighted that in the whole procedure the proposed solution technique does not require to store a series of full matrices ( e.g. coefficient matrices @xmath262 ) at all .",
    "all in all , we can conclude that our proposed ids with fast solution techniques is still more promising than the ids with common implementation .",
