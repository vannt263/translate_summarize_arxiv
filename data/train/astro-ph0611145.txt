    "a single or multiple absorption features have been found from nearby radio - quiet nss @xcite and two broad absorption features were detected from 1e1207.4@xmath35209 ( hereafter 1e1207 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , 1e1207 is unique among these inss since one of the features appears above 1 kev , while the other inss have absorption features at @xmath5@xmath6 kev .",
    "identification of the observed spectral features will not only allow a measurement of the surface composition and magnetic field strength @xmath7 but also constrain the nuclear equation of state via a measurement of the gravitational redshift @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the ns mass and radius , respectively .",
    "the surface composition is usually assumed to be hydrogen because the fast sedimentation time ( due to the strong surface gravity ) causes the lightest elements to rise to the top @xcite and only a tiny amount of hydrogen is required to produce an optically thick atmosphere @xcite .",
    "hydrogen atmospheres in strong magnetic fields have been studied in great detail by addressing the complicated properties of strongly - magnetized dense plasmas @xcite .",
    "partially - ionized hydrogen atmosphere models show spectral features , such as the proton cyclotron line , photo - ionization edge , and atomic transition lines at @xmath12  kev @xcite",
    ". however , hydrogen atmospheres can not produce strong spectral features at @xmath13  kev because ( 1 ) the binding energy of a hydrogen atom never exceeds @xmath14 kev at any @xmath7 @xcite , ( 2 ) qed effects significantly reduce line strengths at @xmath15  g @xcite , and ( 3 ) the fraction of hydrogen molecular ions ( which may have transition lines above 1 kev ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is negligible ( @xmath16 ) at @xmath17 g and @xmath18 k @xcite .",
    "therefore , spectral features at @xmath19  kev ( such as the 1.4  kev absorption line of 1e1207 ) hint at a non - hydrogenic element atmosphere on the ns surface @xcite . also , recent theoretical studies suggest that a hydrogen layer on the surface may be rapidly depleted by diffuse nuclear burning or pulsar winds , thus exposing the heavier elements that lie underneath @xcite .",
    "the few existing non - hydrogenic atmosphere models @xcite are far from complete , due mainly to a lack of accurate atomic data for multi - electron ions in the high magnetic field regime and crude treatment of ionic motional and non - ideal effects . in this paper , we construct mid - z element ( carbon , oxygen and neon ) atmosphere models that are compatible with the high quality x - ray data of _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton_. we only consider magnetic field strengths @xmath0@xmath1",

    "we briefly describe here several major improvements of our mid - z element atmosphere models over the previous atmosphere models by @xcite ( for helium and mid - z elements ) and @xcite ( for iron ) .",
    "\\(1 ) the previous non - hydrogenic atmosphere models assume that bound electrons are in the ground landau state ( adiabatic approximation ) . however , the adiabatic approximation is not valid for the low @xmath7 and high atomic number @xmath20 regime that we consider in this paper .",
    "for instance , the ionization energy of the innermost electron of @xmath2110 element ions at @xmath0 g is underestimated by 510% in the adiabatic approximation .",
    "\\(2 ) numerous bound states and transitions are needed to construct mid - z element atmospheres .",
    "the model of @xcite does not include bound - bound transitions , while the iron atmosphere model of @xcite utilizes rather crude atomic line data ( the energy values and oscillator strengths have as much as 10% and a factor of 2 uncertainties , respectively ) .",
    "we explicitly calculated line energies and oscillator strengths for numerous transitions .",
    "for instance , nearly 600 transition lines are included in the oxygen atmosphere model at @xmath0 g.    \\(3 ) in the case of hydrogen and helium , it is non - trivial to take into account the effects of a finite nuclear mass @xcite .",
    "however , a simple perturbative approach , introduced by @xcite , is applicable to mid - z element atmospheres due to the larger nuclear mass and binding energies .",
    "\\(4 ) all the previous magnetized atmosphere models , except the recent hydrogen atmosphere models of @xcite , adopt polarization vectors assuming the plasma is fully - ionized .",
    "however , such atmosphere models may not produce correct spectra and absorption line profiles at low temperatures when the plasma is partially - ionized @xcite . in our model",
    ", we explicitly compute polarization vectors by taking into account the effects of bound - bound and bound - free transitions .",
    "\\(5 ) our radiative transfer code has been extensively tested for partially - ionized hydrogen atmospheres at various magnetic field strengths @xcite .",
    "the code can be made applicable to mid - z element atmospheres in which numerous line and edge features are present .",

    "in a strong magnetic field , the atomic structure is quite different from the non - magnetic case .",
    "a strong magnetic field deforms the atom into a cylindrical shape when magnetic field effects are larger than coulomb field effects , i.e. , at @xmath22 ( landau regime ) , where @xmath23 . a bound electron in the landau regime is often denoted by two quantum numbers @xmath24 and @xmath25 [ hereafter we use @xmath26 to denote a bound state ] , where @xmath24 is the magnetic quantum number and @xmath25 is the longitudinal quantum number along the field line . @xmath27 ( tightly - bound ) states have a larger binding energy than @xmath28 ( loosely - bound ) states . when @xmath29 , the ground state configuration is composed of bound electrons all in tightly - bound states , i.e. @xmath30 states .",
    "when the axisymmetry around the magnetic field is preserved , transitions with @xmath31 and @xmath32 or @xmath33 and @xmath34 are allowed by dipole selection rules .",
    "the former transitions occur in the longitudinal polarization mode ( @xmath35 , parallel to @xmath7 ) , while the latter transitions occur in the circular polarization modes ( @xmath36 , transverse to @xmath7 ) .",
    "several forbidden transitions ( e.g. , @xmath37 transition ) will have non - zero oscillator strengths when the motional stark field breaks the axisymmety around the magnetic field @xcite . however , we neglect these weak transitions because the motional stark effects are significantly smaller in mid - z element plasmas .",
    "we developed a fast and accurate atomic code suitable for the landau regime @xcite .",
    "the code provides atomic data to better than 1% and 10% accuracy for energies and oscillator strengths , respectively .",
    "most importantly , by applying perturbation methods to higher landau levels , we have an extended range of applicable magnetic fields ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the fast algorithm enables us to compute atomic data for numerous electron configurations within reasonable cpu time .",
    "we also evaluate bound - free cross - sections following @xcite .      among various line broadening mechanisms in strongly - magnetized mid - z element plasmas ,",

    "the second - order energy shift ( note that the first - order term vanishes ) is given by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the pseudomomentum component perpendicular to the magnetic field and @xmath43 is the transverse mass ( @xmath44 ) defined in @xcite and @xcite .    for a given bound state @xmath45",
    ", one can evaluate @xmath43 from atomic binding energies calculated under the infinite nuclear mass assumption @xcite . the increase in the mass due to motional stark effects",
    "is roughly proportional to @xmath46 for loosely - bound ( @xmath28 ) states .",
    "therefore , the mass correction factor of the h - like carbon ion is smaller than that of hydrogen by a factor of @xmath47 .",
    "we computed the transverse mass for bound states with an electron in a @xmath28 state using the atomic data of h - like ions since bound electrons in a @xmath28 state are located at a large distance from the other bound electrons in tightly - bound states .",
    "this procedure saves a significant amount of computation time , while the results are nearly identical to those of the more rigorous calculation .",
    "since the motional stark field reduces the binding energy , the line profile has a wing towards lower energies @xcite . in our opacity calculation , we computed a line profile for motional stark broadening following @xcite and @xcite .",
    "other less important sources of line broadening are thermal doppler and pressure broadening . in a dense plasma",
    ", electron bound states are perturbed by electric fields from electrons ( electron collisional broadening ) and ions ( quasi - static stark broadening ) @xcite .",

    "temperature profiles in the mid - z element atmospheres are closer to grey than in hydrogen atmospheres since the opacities are less energy - dependent , while the free - free opacity ( which is dominant in hydrogen atmospheres ) has a steep energy dependence .",

    "saha equilibrium is recovered .",
    "the condition for the boltzmann distribution ( hatched area ) becomes irrelevant in the ( @xmath133 ) regime where a fraction of excited states is small ( solid lines ) .",

    "we thus expect that only a few strong absorption lines will be altered by non - lte effects , while the bulk of the mid - z element atmosphere structure and spectra are unaffected in our models . to address the non - lte effects , one must find collisional - radiative steady states by solving rate equations with both radiative and collisional processes included @xcite .",

    "most absorption lines have asymmetric profiles with low energy tails due to motional stark effects .",
    "some of the strong lines show more complex profiles due to the enhanced polarizability near the lines .",

    "this is contrary to the results of unmagnetized ns atmosphere spectra in which several absorption features vary in their strengths and shapes strongly with @xmath109 @xcite .",
    "the weak dependence on @xmath109 is partially due to the fact that spectral features in mid - z element atmospheres are primarily broadened by motional stark effects ( which are independent of plasma density ) and pressure effects are small ( since absorption lines are formed at low density ) .",

    "multi - wavelength sed analysis over optical and x - ray bands will be useful since mid - z element atmospheres are significantly softer than hydrogen atmospheres @xcite . since the number of absorption features and their energies are strongly dependent on the surface composition , it is possible to distinguish between carbon and oxygen atmospheres if multiple spectral features are detected .",
    "the absorption features shown in figures  [ fig_spec_c12][fig_spec_ne13 ] are deeper and narrower than the observed spectral features from inss @xcite .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that our atmosphere models are constructed with a single magnetic field strength @xmath7 and orientation @xmath117 , thus reflecting emission from a local patch on the ns surface .",
    "the absorption features in our model spectra will appear broadened if there are magnetic field variations over the surface .",

    "figure  [ fig_mag_spec ] shows carbon atmosphere spectra at two magnetic field strengths and angles , corresponding to the pole and equator for a magnetic dipole configuration .",
    "indeed , atmosphere spectra can look quite different merely due to a factor of two difference in the magnetic field strength .",
    "thus thermal spectra of inss can show significant rotational phase - variation due to a magnetic field distribution , even when the surface temperature is uniform .    in order to construct synthetic atmosphere spectra",
    ", one must integrate emission from patches of the ns surface with differing @xmath7 , @xmath117 , and @xmath120 .",

    "electron or ion cyclotron lines may appear in the x - ray band when @xmath7 is lower or higher than the values considered in this paper .",
    "some of the observed absorption features have been attributed to cyclotron lines @xcite .",
    "since cyclotron line energy varies linearly with @xmath7 , we expect cyclotron lines to be broader and have larger phase variation than atomic lines",
    ". therefore , line width analysis can be a useful diagnostic tool to probe the magnetic field distribution over the ns surface , given that the intrinsic widths of absorption lines are narrow in mid - z element atmospheres @xcite .",
    "magnetic field variation can smear out narrow absorption lines and reduce the accuracy of determining other ns parameters such as the gravitational redshift .",
    "phase - resolved spectroscopy is essential to disentangle magnetic field effects from the other parameters and to probe the magnetic field geometry .",
    "the effective temperature must be measured to constrain the cooling history of nss @xcite .",
    "thermal spectra of most inss are fit with either blackbody or fully - ionized hydrogen atmosphere models , each of which exhibits the softest and hardest spectra , respectively .",
    "therefore , errors in the measured effective temperatures are primarily due to uncertainty in the surface composition .",
    "although mid - z element atmospheres can have overall seds close to a blackbody , there are several significant differences from blackbody spectra . in the wien tail ,",
    "mid - z element atmosphere spectra are softer than a blackbody due to photo - absorption lines and edges and become harder than a blackbody at higher energy .",
    "therefore the effective temperature can be higher than the blackbody temperature if high energy tails are not fully covered by x - ray spectroscopy .",
    "alternatively , the high energy part of x - ray spectra may be erroneously fit by an additional blackbody component ( see section  [ sec_1207 ] for the case of 1e1207 ) .",
    "it is important to cover a wide energy band and fit the data with model atmosphere spectra , rather than fitting with one or two blackbody components and simple gaussian or lorentzian absorption lines .",
    "one of the ultimate goals in ns research is to uniquely determine the mass and radius of nss and constrain the nuclear equation of state of the ns core . in x - ray spectroscopy ,",
    "gravitational redshift @xmath8 is one of the ns parameters which can be measured once x - ray data are fit with model atmosphere spectra .",
    "the accuracy of a gravitational redshift measurement is limited by magnetic field surface variations since line energies change with both @xmath7 and @xmath8 . to increase accuracy ,",
    "phase - resolved spectroscopy is essential because @xmath7 varies with rotation phase but @xmath8 does not .",
    "grating spectroscopy will measure gravitational redshift with high accuracy if magnetic field variation is not so severe and photon statistics is good . in the future , high - resolution spectroscopy missions , such as _ constellation - x",
    "_ , will be able to measure the magnetic field and gravitational redshift with unprecedented accuracy .",
    "it is possible to measure the surface gravity ( @xmath109 ) from line widths if the lines are primarily broadened by pressure effects @xcite .",
    "however , motional stark effects produce line broadening far larger than pressure effects ; this is partly because lines are formed in low density layers .",
    "also , our study indicates that it is difficult to measure surface gravity from overall spectral fitting since mid - z element spectra have a very weak dependence on @xmath109 ( see figure  [ fig_spec_grav ] ) .",
    "therefore , the methods for constraining @xmath109 by using absorption features is applicable only to weakly - magnetized nss ( @xmath152 g ) since their spectra are nearly free from the magnetic field effects discussed in this paper ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",
    ", it may be possible to constrain @xmath109 in heavier element atmospheres ( e.g. , fe ) since motional stark effects are further reduced while ion - coupling effects are enhanced .",
    "we plan to investigate heavy element atmospheres composed of silicon and iron in future work .",
    "radius measurements are feasible by combining x - ray spectroscopy ( which measures flux ) and distance measurements .",
    "distances to several nearby inss have been measured with relatively high accuracy by parallax measurements @xcite .",
    "however , it should be kept in mind that only a fraction of the surface ( such as hot spots ) may be visible due to temperature anisotropy caused by strong magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "independent lightcurve analysis will be helpful to determine the size of the emission region .",
