    "the distribution of matter in the cosmos depends on the gravitational interaction and the expansion history of the universe . assuming that galaxies trace the mass distribution , a measurement of galaxy clustering can be used to derive fundamental properties of the universe .    on large scales the movement of galaxies",
    "is dominated by the hubble recession , while on small scales the gravitational field introduces so - called peculiar velocities .",
    "individual galaxy redshifts combine both hubble recession and peculiar velocities indistinguishably .",
    "however , these effects can be statistically distinguished in a large sample of galaxy redshifts .",
    "this is the purpose of this paper .",
    "the difference between the redshift - inferred distance and the true distance is known as redshift - space distortion .",
    "redshift - space distortions effectively couple the density and velocity fields , complicating the models needed to accurately describe observed galaxy samples . on the other hand",
    "they permit measurements of the properties of the galaxy velocity field , which are difficult to access otherwise . in standard gravity",
    "we can use the amplitude of peculiar velocities to measure parameters that describe the matter content of the universe such as @xmath18 and @xmath8 .    in this paper",
    "we report measurements of the parameter combination @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the growth rate of cosmic structure ( in terms of the linear growth factor @xmath21 and cosmic scale factor @xmath22 ) and @xmath8 is the r.m.s . of the matter fluctuations in spheres of @xmath9mpc .",
    "the measurement of @xmath19 can be used to test theories of dark energy and modified gravity , since a stronger gravitational interaction causes a larger growth rate @xmath23 .",
    "it is interesting to note in this context the fact that a different form of gravitational interaction on large scales could be responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "probes such as type ia supernovae , the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) or baryon acoustic oscillations , which have proven the existence of the current acceleration of the expansion of the universe ( e.g.  @xcite ) , can not distinguish between acceleration due to a dark energy component with negative pressure or due to a modification of general relativity",
    ". however , measurements of the growth of structure are able to distinguish between these models .    in order to measure @xmath19",
    "we have to model the effect of redshift - space distortions on the correlation function .",
    "while on large scales linear theory can be used to model these effects , on smaller scales non - linear contributions complicate the process .",
    "several new approaches have been suggested in recent years to extend linear theory .",
    "we will discuss some of these models and apply them to our dataset .",
    "redshift - space distortions have previously been analysed using both the correlation function and power spectrum using data from the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ;  @xcite ) and the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ;  @xcite ) .",
    "more recently it has become possible to do similar studies at higher redshift using the vvds  @xcite , wigglez  @xcite and vlt vimos surveys  @xcite .",
    "redshift - space distortion measurements are also sensitive to the overall amplitude of the clustering pattern of matter , commonly parameterised by @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "this parameter is used to normalise the amplitude of clustering statistics such as the correlation function , @xmath24 . from the cmb we have a very accurate measurement of the matter fluctuations in the early universe ( the scalar amplitude @xmath25 ) at the time of decoupling , @xmath26 . in order to derive @xmath27",
    "we have to extrapolate this measurement to redshift zero , involving assumptions about the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the cmb constraint on @xmath8 heavily depends on these assumptions .",
    "hence there is a clear advantage in obtaining low - redshift measurements of this parameter .",
    "the 6df galaxy survey , which we analyse in this study , is one of the largest galaxy redshift surveys available .",
    "its very small effective redshift and wide areal coverage ( @xmath28 of the sky ) make it a powerful sample for the study of the local galaxy distribution .    galaxy surveys usually have to consider degeneracies between redshift - space distortions and the alcock - paczynski effect , which arises from the need to assume a cosmological model to transform redshifts into distances . at low redshift",
    "this effect is very small , meaning that our measurement is fairly independent of the choice of the fiducial cosmological model .",
    "while at high redshift ( @xmath29 ) the matter density dominates both the expansion of the universe and the growth of perturbations , at low redshift these two are partially decoupled , with dark energy mostly dominating the background expansion and the matter density dominating the growth of perturbations . as a result in @xmath30cdm and most proposed modified gravity models , low redshift measurements of the growth rate have a better constraining power than high redshift measurements .",
    "the measurement of the growth rate in 6dfgs therefore not only provides a new independent data point at very low redshift , but also promises to make a valuable contribution to tests of general relativity on cosmic scales .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : survey ] we introduce the 6df galaxy survey . in section  [ sec : data ]",
    "we describe the details of the correlation function estimate and introduce the 2d correlation function of 6dfgs . in section  [ sec : error ] we derive the covariance matrix for the 2d correlation function . in section  [ sec : theory ] we summarise the theory of redshift - space distortions , including extensions to the standard linear approach .",
    "we also discuss wide - angle effects and other systematics , such as the alcock - paczynski effect . in section  [ sec",
    ": fit ] we fit the 2d correlation function to derive @xmath31 and @xmath8 .",
    "cosmological implications are investigated in section  [ sec : impl ] . in section",
    "[ sec : future ] we make fisher matrix predictions for two future low redshift galaxy surveys , wallaby and the proposed taipan survey .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .    throughout the paper we use @xmath32 to denote real space separations and @xmath33 to denote separations in redshift - space .",
    "our fiducial model assumes a flat universe with @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",

    "a subset of early - type 6dfgs galaxies ( approximately @xmath45 ) have measured line - widths that will be used to derive fundamental plane distances and peculiar motions .",

    "the 2mass magnitudes are on the vega system .",
    "the mean completeness of the 6dfgs is 92 percent and median redshift is @xmath47 .",
    "completeness corrections are derived by normalising completeness - apparent magnitude functions so that , when integrated over all magnitudes , they equal the measured total completeness on a particular patch of sky .",
    "this procedure is outlined in the luminosity function evaluation of  @xcite and also in jones et al . , ( in prep ) .",
    "the original survey papers  @xcite describe in full detail the implementation of the survey and its associated online database .",
    "the clustering in a galaxy survey is estimated relative to a random ( unclustered ) distribution which follows the same angular and redshift selection function as the galaxy sample itself .",
    "we base our random mock catalogue generation on the 6dfgs luminosity function , where we use random numbers to pick volume - weighted redshifts and luminosity function - weighted absolute magnitudes .",
    "we then test whether the redshift - magnitude combination falls within the 6dfgs @xmath0-band faint and bright apparent magnitude limits ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : wred ] shows the redshift distribution of the 6dfgs @xmath0-selected sample ( black solid line ) compared to a mock catalogue with the same number of galaxies ( black dashed line ) .",

    "given the low redshift of our dataset , these assumptions have a very small impact on our final results ( see section  [ sec : ap ] ) .",
    "we define the positions of two galaxies as @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the redshift - space separation is then given by @xmath54 , while @xmath55 is the mean distance to the pair of galaxies .",

    "we do this for the 6dfgs data catalogue , a random catalogue with the same selection function , and a combination of data - random pairs .",
    "we call the pair - separation distributions obtained from this analysis step @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . in the analysis we used @xmath63 random catalogues with the same size as the real data catalogue and average @xmath62 and @xmath61",
    ". the redshift - space correlation function itself is then given by  @xcite : @xmath64 where the ratio @xmath65 is given by @xmath66 and the sums go over all random ( @xmath67 ) and data ( @xmath68 ) galaxies .",
    "the galaxies are weighted by the inverse completeness @xmath69 of their area of the sky @xmath70 we will discuss further weighting techniques in the next section .",
    "there is a possible bias in the estimation of the correlation function due to the fact that we estimate both the mean density and the pair counts from the same survey .",
    "this leads to a non - zero difference between the true correlation function estimate of an ensemble of surveys and the ensemble average of @xmath71 from each survey .",
    "this is commonly known as the integral constraint ( e.g.  @xcite ) , which can be calculated as ( see e.g.  @xcite ) @xmath72 and enters our correlation function estimate as @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the redshift - space correlation function from eq .",
    "[ eq : ls2 ] and @xmath75 is the model for the correlation function . in 6dfgs",
    "@xmath76 is typically around @xmath77 and so has no significant impact on the final result .    in figure",
    "[ fig : kaiser ] we show the 2d correlation function calculated from the 6dfgs dataset . in this figure",
    "we use bins of @xmath78mpc , while for the analysis later on we use larger bins of @xmath79mpc ( see figure  [ fig : kaiser_models ] ) .",
    "the figure shows clearly the two effects of redshift - space distortions which we will discuss later in section  [ sec : theory ] , the `` finger - of - god '' effect at small @xmath57 , and the linear infall effect at larger @xmath57 which gives the correlation function a non - circular shape .      in fourier space",
    "the error in measuring the amplitude of a mode of the linear power spectrum is given by @xmath80 where @xmath10 is the linear bias , @xmath23 is the growth rate , @xmath81 is the cosine of the angle to the line of sight and @xmath82 is the matter power spectrum .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of this equation represents the sample - variance error , while the second term ( @xmath83 ) represents the poisson error .",
    "if the sample - variance error is dominant we can reduce the power spectrum error by employing a weighting scheme which depends upon the galaxy density @xmath84 , such as the one suggested by  @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 describes the amplitude of the weighting .",
    "a stronger weighting ( larger value of @xmath86 ) yields a smaller sample - variance error since it increases the survey volume by up - weighting sparsely sampled regions .",
    "however , such a weighting scheme also increases the poisson error because it shifts the effective redshift to larger values with a smaller galaxy number density .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : kaiser_error ] and  [ fig : kaiser_error2 ] .",
    "such a weighting scheme is standard for large scale structure analyses .    in a magnitude - limited sample such as 6dfgs , up - weighting higher redshift galaxies",
    "also has the effect of shifting the galaxy bias to larger values .",
    "the sample - variance error is proportional to the clustering amplitude , and so a larger bias results in a larger error .",
    "however , the weighting will still ensure that the relative error of the power spectrum , @xmath87 , is minimised .",
    "the redshift - space distortion signal is inversely proportional to the galaxy bias , @xmath88 .",
    "if weighting increases the bias @xmath10 , it also reduces the signal we are trying to measure .",
    "we therefore must investigate whether the advantage of the weighting ( the reduced relative error ) outweighs the disadvantage ( increasing galaxy bias ) .",
    "the situation is very different for measuring a signal that is proportional to the clustering amplitude , such as the baryon acoustic peak . in this case",
    "the error and the signal are proportional to the bias , and so weighting will always be beneficial . we stress that an increasing bias with redshift is expected in almost all galaxy redshift surveys . therefore redshift - space distortion studies should first test whether galaxy weighting improves the measurement .",
    "the 6df galaxy survey is quite sensitive to the weighting scheme employed because it has a high galaxy density , making the sample - variance error by far the dominant source of error .",
    "finally , we have to consider the correlation between the bins in the measured power spectrum or correlation function .",
    "if the error is sample - variance dominated , the bins will show large correlation ( especially in the correlation function ) , while in the case of poisson - noise dominated errors , the correlation is much smaller .",
    "weighting will always increase the poisson noise and hence reduce the correlation between bins .",
    "all of the density weighting effects discussed above need to be considered , before deciding which weighting is best suited to the specific analysis .",
    "we summarise as follows :    * if a galaxy sample is sample - variance limited , density weighting will reduce the ( relative ) error of the clustering measurement . *",
    "in most galaxy redshift surveys , the density weighting increases the galaxy bias , which reduces the redshift - space distortion signal , by flattening the clustering anisotropy .",
    "* galaxy weighting also reduces the correlation between bins in the power spectrum and correlation function .    whether the signal - to - noise is actually improved by density weighting",
    "depends on the specific sample . for the 6dfgs redshift - space distortion analysis we found @xmath89mpc@xmath90 leads to the most accurate constraint on the growth rate .",
    "this discussion also indicates that low - biased galaxy samples have an advantage over a highly biased galaxy sample in measuring redshift - space distortions .",
    "we will discuss this point further in section  [ sec : future ] .",
    "in this section we will derive a covariance matrix for the 2d correlation function using jack - knife re - sampling .",
    "we also use log - normal realisations to test the jack - knife covariance matrix .",
    "[ fig : kaiser_errors ]      we divide the dataset into @xmath91 subsets , selected in r.a . and",
    "each re - sampling step excludes one subset before calculating the correlation function .",
    "the @xmath92 remaining subsets have a volume which is @xmath93 times the volume of the original data .",
    "the covariance matrix is then given by @xmath94\\left[\\xi^k(s_j ) - \\overline{\\xi}(s_j)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath95 is the correlation function estimate at separation @xmath96 with the exclusion of subset @xmath97 .",
    "the mean value is defined as @xmath98 the case @xmath99 gives the error ignoring correlations between bins @xmath100 .",
    "we can create a log - normal realisation  @xcite of a galaxy survey by deriving a density field from a model power spectrum , @xmath82 , assuming gaussian fluctuations .",
    "this density field is then poisson sampled , taking into account the window function and the total number of galaxies .",
    "the assumption that the input power spectrum has gaussian fluctuations can only be used if the fluctuations are much smaller than the mean density , otherwise the gaussian model assigns a non - zero probability to regions of negative density",

    "log - normal realisations do not account for non - linear mode coupling and are very model - dependent in the quasi - linear and non - linear regime .",
