    "in atoms , optical transition selection rules are determined by orbital magnetic moments of the atomic levels .",
    "bloch bands in solids can inherit these rules from their parent atomic orbits .",
    "a well known example is the optical transition between @xmath1-like conduction and @xmath2-like valance bands in semiconductors .",
    "strong spin - orbit coupling in the @xmath2 bands mixes orbital moment with spin moment , and as a result , spin degree of freedom distinguishes two groups of electrons in their response to light with opposite circular polarizations .",
    "this forms the basis for spin optoelectronics applications in semiconductors .",
    "@xcite    in this paper , we explore an entirely different origin of selection rules and circular dichroism for optical interband transitions in solids .",
    "in addition to the intracellular current circulation of the parent atomic orbits , orbital magnetic moment of bloch electrons has a contribution from intercellular current circulation governed by bulk symmetry properties .",
    "we show that this contribution is also tied to optical circular dichroism . when inversion symmetry is broken , contrasted circular dichroism is allowed in different regions of the brillouin zone , which takes the extreme form of optical transition selection rules at high symmetry points .",
    "we illustrate this general physics in graphene , the monolayer carbon honeycomb lattice recently realized in free - standing forms .  @xcite the isolated graphene crystallite is a zero - gap semiconductor : the conduction and valence bands conically touch each other , forming two inequivalent valleys at the corners of the first brillouin zone .",
    "inversion symmetry breaking is being exploited as a powerful approach towards bandgap engineering ,  @xcite motivated by the need of semiconductor energy gap for graphene based logic devices .",
    "@xcite in graphene single layer , inversion symmetry is broken when the two sublattices become inequivalent .",
    "this effect is generally expected in epitaxially grown graphene ,  @xcite where staggered sublattice potential can arise either directly from the substrate such as bn ,  @xcite or from a carbon buffer monolayer covalently bonded to sic substrate .",
    "@xcite recent angular resolved photo emission spectroscopy has identified mid - infrared bandgap in graphene epitaxially grown on sic ,  @xcite attributed to this mechanism . in graphene bilayer ,",
    "experiments and theories have revealed an energy gap continuously tunable from zero to mid - infrared by an interlayer gate bias that breaks the inversion symmetry .",
    "@xcite we find that at the center of the two inequivalent valleys , interband transitions couple exclusively to optical field of opposite circular polarizations .",
    "besides graphene , many conventional semiconductor materials have noncentral @xmath0-space valleys , e.g. si and alas .",
    "valley - based electronics applications have recently attracted great interests where this extra degree of freedom is suggested as an information carrier .",
    "@xcite in conjugation with the progressively achieved advances in piezoelectric control and magnetic control of valley degree of freedom ,  @xcite valley contrasted optical circular dichroism from inversion symmetry breaking creates an entirely new possibility to optically address the valley physics .",
    "this may form the basis of valley based optoelectronics applications in graphene and conventional semiconductors , in direct analogy to the well developed spin based optoelectronics .",
    "@xcite    this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_general ] , a universal connection is revealed between the @xmath0-resolved optical oscillator strength of interband transitions , and the band properties of orbital magnetic moment and berry curvatures .",
    "we show how inversion symmetry breaking allows contrasted circular dichroism for interband transitions in different regions of the brillouin zone , which becomes a rigorous optical selection rule at high symmetry points . in section [ section_rule ] ,",
    "we demonstrate the valley contrasted optical selection rule in two qualitatively different graphene systems with broken inversion symmetry , i.e. single layer with staggered sublattice potential and bilayer with an interlayer gate bias . in section [ section_application ] , we discuss graphene based valley optoelectronics applications where light polarization information can be interconverted with electronic information . in appendix",
    "[ appen_sum ] , we give two circular dichroic sum rules for optical measurement of orbital magnetization and intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity in ferromagnetic systems , which are direct consequence of the connection between interband optical transitions and the band topological properties discussed in section [ sec_general ] .",
    "we consider a non - degenerate band @xmath3 for which the intracellular circulation currents from the parent atomic orbit is assumed absent .",
    "@xcite orbital magnetic moment contributed by the intercellular current circulation can be given from the @xmath4 analysis  @xcite @xmath5 in the above , @xmath6 is the interband matrix element of the canonical momentum operator , @xmath7 is the band dispersion , and @xmath8 the periodical part of the bloch function .",
    "@xcite it is worth noting that this intercellular current circulation is responsible for the anomalous @xmath9-factor of electron in semiconductors : the two bloch states with opposite spin at @xmath10 point form a kramer s pair with opposite @xmath11 which renormalize the spin zeeman energy .",
    "@xcite    now we consider the simplest situation of a two band model , where @xmath12 will have identical value in the upper and lower bands as evident from eq .",
    "( [ obitalmoment ] ) .",
    "the projection of @xmath12 along the light propagation direction ( @xmath13 ) can be expressed as @xmath14 where the right hand side is the difference in @xmath0-resolved oscillator strength of @xmath15 and @xmath16 circular polarizations .",
    "@xcite @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the bohr magneton of free electron .",
    "further , with the equality for the polarization averaged oscillator strength @xmath19 \\label{sum},\\ ] ] we find , for the interband transition at a @xmath0-space point , the degree of circular polarization is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the _ effective _ bohr magneton with the bare electron mass replaced by the isotropic part of the _ effective mass_. generalization of these relations to many - bands is straightforward where the contribution from each pair of bands to the @xmath0-resolved oscillator strength and orbital magnetic moment assumes a similar relation .",
    "such connections open up the possibility to engineer optical circular dichroism in given bands through intercellular circulation currents determined by bulk symmetry properties . in the presence of time reversal symmetry , two bloch states with opposite crystal momentum form a kramer s pair with opposite orbital moment , and",
    "hence the overall circular dichroism vanishes . on the other hand",
    ", inversion symmetry dictates that a bloch state at @xmath22 also has a counterpart at @xmath23 with identical orbital moment .",
    "thus , inversion symmetry breaking is a necessary condition for contrasted circular dichroism in different regions of the brillouin zone . at high symmetry points where the bloch states are invariant under a @xmath24-fold discrete rotation about the light propagation direction : @xmath25 , an azimuthal selection rule @xmath26 is expected for interband transitions by light of @xmath27 circular polarization .",
    "berry curvature is another property that reflects handedness of bloch electrons and it always accompanies the intercellular current circulations in the bloch band  @xcite @xmath28 while moving in an in - plane electric field , the carriers acquire an anomalous velocity in the transverse direction proportional to the berry curvature , the charge and the field , giving rise to the hall effect .",
    "@xcite for the two band model discussed above , we simply find @xmath29 where @xmath12 and @xmath30 both stands for their value in the upper band ( we note that @xmath30 will have opposite value in the upper and lower bands as evident from eq .  ( [ curvature ] ) ) .",
    "hence , valley contrasted optical circular dichroism is also generally accompanied by a valley contrasted contribution to the hall conductivity .",
    "this makes possible optoelectronic schemes implementing this topological transport phenomena , as will be discussed in section  [ section_application ] .    in ferromagnetic systems",
    ", the universal connection between @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 directly leads to the dichroic sum rules for optical measurement of orbital magnetization and intrinsic anomalous hall conductivity , as given in appendix  [ appen_sum ] .",
    "it has been shown by previous studies that a finite bandgap opens in graphene as a generic consequence of inversion symmetry breaking .",
    "@xcite optical interband transitions can then be addressed in a similar way as that in conventional direct bandgap semiconductors .",
    "the bandedges of both the conduction and valance bands occur at the dirac points which have the three - fold discrete rotational symmetry .",

    "the extremely weak spin - orbit coupling can be neglected .",

    "a nearly perfect selection rule is obtained near the dirac points where valley @xmath55 ( @xmath54 ) favors @xmath16 ( @xmath15 ) polarized light , similar to that in the graphene single layer with staggered sublattice potential .",
    "a distinct feature for this interband transition is the distribution of oscillator strength sharply concentrated at the band - edge of the mexican hat like energy dispersion , in concert with the distribution of orbital magnetic moment and berry curvatures found in ref .  .",
    "interestingly , the transition between the two conduction bands also has a perfect selection rule but with opposite chirality in the vicinity of the dirac points .",
