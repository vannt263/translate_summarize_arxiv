    "it was demonstrated experimentally by petrashov and co - workers @xcite that the resistance of mesoscopic diffusive normal - superconducting ( ns ) hybrid structures can be quite strongly modulated by an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "these observations open a possibility to construct the so - called andreev interferometers which  for a number of applications  may have several important advantages over the well known superconducting quantum interference devices ( squids ) .",
    "such kind of applications include , e.g. , read - out of superconducting qubits@xcite or experimental analysis of switching dynamics of individual magnetic nanoparticles@xcite and require such features of a detecting device as reduced intrinsic dissipation ( down to fw level ) , the possibility to achieve higher sensitivity and read - out speed as well a broad choice of normal conductors employed as a weak link .",
    "recently , there were both experimental @xcite and theoretical @xcite investigations of hybrid ns structures with pronounced dependencies of their resistance on the applied magnetic flux .",
    "contrary to the initial design of andreev interferometers pioneered by petrashov and co - authors @xcite , this latest analysis focuses on systems with all external electrodes in the superconducting state . in this way",
    "one would be able to reduce dissipation .",
    "current ( voltage ) harmonics would be generated in this case , which are multiples of the josephson frequency .",
    "however , they can be filtered out and the average current ( voltage ) can be measured which should reveal a dependence on the magnetic flux .    in ref .",
    "we already carried out a detailed theoretical analysis of andreev interferometers in the voltage - biased regime . while this regime can be realized in some experiments , of a clear experimental interest",
    "is also another physical situation when the system is biased by a fixed external current .",
    "the main purpose of the present work is to analyze the behavior of andreev interferometers in the current - biased regime .",
    "note that the system behavior in the latter regime can be very different from that in the voltage - biased one . in a vast majority of normal structures",
    "these differences mainly concern higher cumulants of voltage and current .",
    "for instance , a decade ago there arose a conundrum caused by experiments @xcite , where the third voltage cumulant of the current - biased normal junction was measured .",
    "the behavior of this quantity was essentially different from theoretical expectations based on the linear relation between the third voltage correlator in the current - biased regime and the third current correlator @xcite in the voltage - biased regime .",
    "this conundrum was resolved in ref .",
    "which major conclusion was that current and voltage correlators of order three and higher are no longer linearly related .    in superconducting circuits",
    "essential differences between the voltage- and current - biased regimes occur already at the level of @xmath0 curves .",
    "such differences were encountered , e.g. , in the case of single josephson junctions @xcite ( see also ref . ) .",
    "the experiments @xcite conformed to the corresponding theoretical predictions .",
    "another example is the low temperature behavior of josephson junction arrays and chains which may vary from superconducting to insulating depending on whether the voltage- or current - biased scheme is considered @xcite .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe the model for andreev interferometers under consideration . in sec .",
    "iii we proceed with theoretical analysis of our model and derive the basic formula that fixes the current - phase relation for our device .",
    "this formula is then employed in sec .",
    "iv where we numerically evaluate the @xmath0 curve for our system in the current - biased regime and study the effect of voltage modulation by an external magnetic flux .",
    "the paper is concluded by a brief discussion of our key observations in sec .",
    "v. some technical details are relegated to appendix .",

    "it consists of three superconducting electrodes characterized by the absolute value of the order parameter @xmath1 and a disordered normal metal insertion embedded between these electrodes .",
    "a typical size @xmath2 of this normal metallic dot is assumed not to exceed the superconducting coherence length @xmath3 and at the same time to be larger than the elastic mean free path @xmath4 .",
    "two superconducting electrodes 2 and 3 form a loop which is pierced by an external magnetic flux @xmath5 .",
    "accordingly , the superconducting phase difference @xmath6 is induced between the electrodes 2 and 3 , where @xmath7 is the superconducting flux quantum .",
    "is caused by the magnetic flux @xmath5 piercing the loop.,width=264 ]    in what follows we will generally assume that all interfaces between the normal metal and superconducting electrodes are weakly transmitting . in this case one can expect to observe a pronounced magnetoresistance modulation effect @xcite . for comparison , in the limit of highly transparent ns interfaces this modulation is expected to remain below ten percent @xcite .",
    "the normal state conductances @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 between three electrodes and the normal insertion obey the condition @xmath11 where the normal state resistance @xmath12 is determined by the standard landauer formula @xmath13 @xmath14 are the transmissions of conducting channels in the first barrier , @xmath15 is the drude conductivity of the normal metal , @xmath16 denotes a typical contact area between the normal metal and the electrode , @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient and @xmath18 is the density of states at the fermi - surface per spin direction",
    ". the electron charge will be denoted by @xmath19 .",
    "( [ tunlim ] ) assures that the voltage drop occurs only across the tunnel barrier between the first electrode and the rest of our system .",
    "the second inequality ( [ tunlim ] ) also guarantees that our results will not depend on the particular shape of the normal metal insertion .",
    "in addition , we will disregard charging effects which amounts to assuming that all relevant effective charging energies remain much smaller than other important energy scales in our problem @xcite .",
    "as we already discussed , below we will be interested in the current - biased regime , i.e. we will assume that our system is biased by an external current source @xmath20 , as it is indicated in fig .",
    "[ setup ] . restricting ourselves to this regime",
    "we will evaluate the time - averaged voltage @xmath21 across our device which should depend both on the bias current @xmath20 and on the external flux @xmath5 ( or , equivalently , on the phase difference @xmath22 ) . in the case of josephson junctions with normal state resistance @xmath12 and capacitance @xmath23",
    "it was demonstrated @xcite that the @xmath0 curves in the current- and voltage - biased regimes differ substantially provided the parameter @xmath24 remains smaller than one .",
    "below we will also stick to the same limit @xmath25 .",
    "the first step to derive the current - voltage characteristics is to establish the dependence of the instantaneous current value @xmath26 on the phase difference @xmath27 across the ns interface with the smallest conductance @xmath28 .",
    "this phase difference is defined by the standard relation @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the time dependent voltage drop across this ns interface . in order to accomplish this goal",
    "one can employ the effective action analysis @xcite .",
    "the general keldysh effective action describing electron transport across the barrier between the first superconducting electrode and the rest of our structure has the form @xmath31.\\label{pact}\\ ] ] here @xmath32 is the green - keldysh matrix of the superconducting reservoir 1 and @xmath33 is the @xmath34 green - keldysh matrix of a disordered normal metal which also acquires superconducting properties due to the contact with the reservoirs 2 and 3 .",
    "the effective action ( [ pact ] ) holds for arbitrary transmission values @xmath14 and allows for a complete description of electron transport through our device .",
    "it is convenient to combine the phase variables on the two branches of the keldysh contour and define the `` classical '' ( @xmath35 ) and `` quantum '' ( @xmath36 ) components of the phase . taking the derivatives of the effective action with respect to the quantum phase @xmath37",
    "one can derive the expressions for all current correlators in our problem .",
    "provided charging effects are weak the action ( [ pact ] ) can be expanded in powers of @xmath37 and reduced to a much simpler form convenient for practical calculations . in the case of ns hybrid structures",
    "this procedure was described in details in ref . .",
    "since here we are merely interested in the tunneling limit @xmath38 , it suffices to expand the action ( [ pact ] ) up to the first order in @xmath14 . then taking the first variation of the action with respect to @xmath37 one arrives at the current - phase relation in the form @xmath39s_1(t - t')\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\int\\limits_0^t dt'\\sin\\left [ \\varphi(t ) + \\varphi(t')\\right]s_2(t - t ' ) , \\label{cphr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "these functions have already been evaluated elsewhere @xcite , therefore here we only briefly recapitulate the corresponding results .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that due to the contact with superconducting terminals 2 and 3 the normal metal also acquires superconducting properties .",
