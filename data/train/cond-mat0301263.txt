    "one of the major challenges in transition - metal oxide thin film research is to grow the material in single crystal form with controlled oxygen stoichiometry . this is not a trivial task especially when the transition metal ion has multiple valences and the variation of the oxygen content leads to a rich and complex phase diagram .",
    "important examples for such materials include the binary oxide systems like the vanadium and titanium oxides @xcite .",
    "the most common and convenient growth methods in thin film research like pulsed laser deposition and sputtering techniques are not very suitable here , because of the high substrate temperatures and consequently also high oxygen pressures usually used , giving less opportunity to fine tune the oxygen stoichiometry .",
    "these techniques are obviously the method of choice for ternary and quarternary oxides , in which one can vary the material properties by tuning one of the constituent cation concentrations while keeping that of the oxygen fixed . for the binary oxides ,",
    "however , one has to resort to true molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) techniques , in which one has to carefully balance the oxygen flux with respect to the metal evaporation rates in order to obtain good control and tuning of the stoichiometry .",
    "the question here is whether one can obtain thin films with physical properties that are systematic , controllable and tunable .",
    "here we report on our research project to grow single crystal thin films of vanadium monoxide ( vo@xmath7 ) , as well as on the study of the physical properties and the electronic structure of these films .",
    "bulk vanadium monoxide has many intriguing properties that are closely related to the issue of stoichiometry .",
    "while at first sight the crystal seems to have the very simple @xmath8 rocksalt structure , it actually can have a very wide range of varying oxygen concentrations : values of @xmath9 have been reported for bulk vo@xmath0 .",
    "even more remarkable is that there is a large number of both cation and anion vacancies , even for @xmath10 , in which case the concentrations are as high as @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "stoichiometric vo always remains disordered , whereas ordering of the vacancies was only reported for @xmath12 between @xmath13 and @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of the physical properties of polycrystalline vo@xmath0 has been carried out by banus et al .",
    "@xcite in the early 70 s .",
    "vo@xmath0 shows an interesting transition from a metallic to a semiconducting type of behavior at @xmath12 close to @xmath15 , and the magnetic susceptibility can be described by a curie - weiss law , suggesting that the v @xmath16 electrons partially localize @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain these properties , in which the role of electron correlation effects , band formation and vacancies are discussed @xcite .",
    "only very little work on films of vo@xmath0 has been done up to know .",
    "metal supported vanadium oxides were investigated by several authors in connection with catalytic properties .",
    "thin v oxide layers deposited on cu(@xmath17)@xciteand ni(@xmath18)@xcite were found to consist of a v@xmath2o@xmath19-like oxide phase after room temperature oxidation .",
    "vo@xmath7-like islands growth was reported on rh(@xmath20)@xcite .",
    "et al . _ found a vo / vo@xmath2 - like phase at low coverage on pd(@xmath21 ) using scanning tunnelling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite .",
    "thin films of vo@xmath0 have also been grown on tio@xmath2 substrates , because of the enhanced catalytic activity shown by titania - supported vanadium oxides @xcite .",
    "et al._@xcite studied locally ordered vo@xmath7 films with a thickness up to @xmath22 ml grown on tio@xmath2(110 ) by evaporating vanadium metal at room temperature and subsequent annealing in vacuum for a short period of time , in order to promote the uptake of oxygen from the substrate . from a structural point of view , local order of their films is supported by x - ray photoelectron diffraction ( xpd ) .    in the examples mentioned above , the vanadium oxidation state was established on the basis of the position and shape of the v @xmath23 photoemission line .",
    "however , the uncertainty of stoichiometry of vanadia films remains , since the binding energies ( be ) of v @xmath23 for different oxidation states are very close , a comparison between data obtained in refs.@xcite and @xcite showing some discrepancies .",
    "moreover , a determination of the physical properties of vo@xmath0 thin films is missing in these studies .",
    "preparation is often found to be difficult since vo@xmath0 easily oxidizes to v@xmath24o@xmath25 .",
    "these problems can be avoided by growing epitaxial films of vo@xmath0 on appropriate substrates with a careful optimization of the evaporation conditions .",
    "this paper describes how we have been able to successfully grow coherent epitaxial single crystalline vo@xmath0 thin films by stabilizing them on mgo(100 ) substrates .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the details of the experimental conditions and equipment used are given in the experimental section ( section ii ) .",
    "the results are described in several subsections .",
    "we first present ( section iiia ) the growth process as monitored structurally _ in - situ _ by reflection high - energy electron diffraction ( rheed ) and low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) and compositionally by x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) .",
    "we then ( section iiib ) determines the stoichiometry @xmath12 of the various vo@xmath0 films by using rutherford backscattering spectrometry ( rbs ) .",
    "further structural details of the epitaxy ( section iiic ) is revealed by _ ex - situ _ x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) .",
    "the important issue of vacancy concentrations is addressed using a combination of the rbs and rheed intensity oscillations ( section iiid ) .",
    "basic data about the electronic structure , such as the valence and local crystal fields of the ions , ( section iiie ) are measured using soft - x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) .",
    "we end the results section by presenting the temperature dependent transport properties of the films ( section iiif ) .",
    "finally we discuss the results by comparing the properties of the vo@xmath0 thin films with those of the bulk material , and with the predictions made by existing theoretical models .",
    "the experiments were performed in an ultra - high vacuum ( uhv ) mbe system , with a base pressure below 1x10@xmath26 mbar , equipped with rheed , leed and xps facilities .",
    "rbs and xrd were used to characterize the thin films grown in the mbe system _ ex - situ_. mgo(100 ) was chosen as the substrate because it has the same cubic rocksalt structure as vo@xmath0 , with a mismatch of about @xmath27 .",
    "mgo blocks were cleaved _",
    "ex - situ _ and immediately introduced into the uhv chamber where the substrates were cleaned by annealing at @xmath28 for @xmath29 hours in 1x10@xmath30 mbar oxygen to remove hydrocarbon contaminations .",
    "clean and well - ordered surfaces , as determined by xps , rheed and leed were obtained .",
    "vanadium ( v ) ( purity @xmath31 ) was evaporated using an electron - beam evaporator ( omicron efm3 ) .",
    "the deposition rate of v , measured by moving a quartz crystal at the position of the substrate , was set to @xmath32  / min .",
    "the vanadium was simultaneously oxidized by a beam of @xmath1o@xmath24 @xmath33 .",
    "the oxygen was supplied through a leak valve into a small buffer volume @xcite connected to the vacuum chamber through a @xmath34 cm long and @xmath15 cm wide stainless steel pipe , ending at a distance of @xmath35 cm from the substrate .",
    "the pressure in the buffer volume was measured with a baratron capacitance manometer .",
    "the variation in buffer pressure during deposition was less than @xmath36 .",
    "vo@xmath0 films with different stoichiometries were grown by varying the @xmath1o@xmath24 buffer volume pressure , while keeping the v flux constant . during evaporation",
    "the background pressure was 2x10@xmath37 mbar or lower .",
    "the v and @xmath1o@xmath24 beams can be abruptly and simultaneously stopped . after closing the @xmath1o@xmath24 valve the background pressure dropped to below 10@xmath38 mbar within seconds , insuring a well - defined oxygen exposure of the sample .",
    "all the samples were grown while keeping the substrate at room temperature ( rt ) .",
    "rheed was used to monitor the evolution of the films .",
    "thicknesses were calibrated by monitoring the rheed intensity oscillations during deposition .",
    "oscillations in the rheed specular beam intensity , where each oscillation corresponds to the formation of one new atomic monolayer ( ml ) , allows for control of the film thickness .",
    "film thicknesses were also determined _ ex - situ _ from x - ray specular reflectivity ( xrr ) measurements @xcite and a good agreement with rheed intensity oscillations was obtained .",
    "xps measurements were performed using nonmonocromatic al k@xmath39 radiation ( @xmath40 ev ) and the total energy resolution of the electron analyzer in combination with the photon source is about @xmath15 ev .",
    "to avoid _ ex - situ _ post - oxidation , a thin mgo cap layer ( @xmath41 ) was grown for protection by mg deposition in @xmath1o@xmath24 atmosphere of 1x10@xmath37 mbar at room temperature .",
    "consequently all the _ ex - situ _ measurements , i.e. rbs , xrd , xas and electrical measurements were done on capped vo@xmath0 samples .    to determine the oxygen content ,",
    "rbs measurements have been performed . for calibration purposes a v@xmath24o@xmath25 epitaxial thin film",
    "was also grown on an al@xmath24o@xmath25(0001 ) substrate , with the oxygen partial pressure and the substrate temperature set at 10@xmath30 mbar and @xmath42c respectively @xcite .",
    "all the measurements were done in a so - called random orientation with respect to the crystalline axes , using a he@xmath43 beam with @xmath44 mev energy .",
    "the backscattering yields were detected at an angle of @xmath45 degrees .",
    "the xrd measurements were done using a philips mrd diffractometer , equipped with a hybrid mirror / monochromator for cu k@xmath46 radiation , a @xmath22-circle goniometer and a programmable slit in front of the detector .",
    "the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) measurements were performed at the @xmath47a dragon beamline @xcite at the synchrotron radiation research center taiwan , using the total electron yield mode .",
    "the light has a degree of linear polarization of @xmath48 and an energy resolution of @xmath49 ev for photon energies between @xmath50 and @xmath51 ev .",
    "the spectra are normalized to the photon flux measured using a gold mesh .",
    "the angle of the incident light is normal to the vo@xmath0 films .",
    "resistivity measurements were performed in a commercial quantum design ppms system .",
    "the electrical measurements were done in the constant voltage mode and the current was measured along the @xmath52 $ ] direction of the films by two and four point geometry .",
    "electrical contacts consisting of @xmath35 nm of cr metal were evaporated _",
    "ex - situ _ on the mgo substrates prior to introduction into the mbe system , in order to measure the resistance of as - grown vo@xmath0 films .",
    "for a wide range of incident oxygen fluxes , epitaxial growth of vo@xmath0 thin films on mgo(100 ) substrates was concluded from _ in situ _ rheed and leed analysis .",
    "our mbe system geometry allows for monitoring changes in surface structure during film growth by rheed .",
    "this low angle electron diffraction technique is particularly suited to thin film growth as it is highly sensitive to surface morphology .",
    "a rheed pattern of a clean mgo(100 ) surface and @xmath41 thick vo@xmath0 thin film deposited on mgo(100 ) is shown in fig.1 .",

    "the basic rheed pattern did not change during growth , suggesting that the film continues to grow as a rocksalt phase on top of the underlying substrate .",
    "sharp streaks and the presence of kikuchi lines indicate that the surface is still smooth after deposition of @xmath35 monolayers ( ml ) of vo@xmath0 .    in most cases oscillations in the intensity of the specularly reflected beam",
    "were observed during growth .",
    "these oscillations are characteristic for a _ layer - by - layer _ growth mode , each oscillation corresponding to the formation of one atomic layer . note that rheed oscillations were observed at room temperature , which is considered to be a very low temperature for an oxide system . in fig.2",

    "the distance between vo@xmath0 streaks is the same as between the mgo streaks .",
    "this is consistent with a coherent growth as determined _ ex - situ _ by xrd , which will be discussed in section iii.c .",
    "the rocksalt structure of vo@xmath0 thin films was also confirmed by leed .",
    "the leed pattern displays the same square symmetry and periodicity as a mgo@xmath65 surface .    between @xmath60 and @xmath57 mtorr ( @xmath66 ) , mgo",
    "rheed streaks fade away quickly after starting the growth and 3d - transmission spots appear , suggesting considerable roughening of the surface .",
    "the absence of a leed pattern for the @xmath67 and @xmath68 cases confirms that the surface morphology is becoming increasingly disordered .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of rheed oscillations shows that the growth is still _ layer - by - layer _ like .    for an oxygen buffer pressure of less than @xmath63 mtorr ( @xmath69 ) powder rings and extra spots",

    "we take this observation as an indication that the vanadium in vo is not all in the local @xmath126 symmetry , but that instead an appreciable amount of vanadium ions are experiencing strong local ligand fields of low symmetry associated with the presence of large amount of vacancies .",
    "these low symmetry ligand fields must be at least several hundreds of mev strong , in order to wash out completely the multiplet structure of a @xmath125-ion in @xmath122 symmetry .",

    "as can be observed from fig.14 the transition from a metallic to a semiconductor type behavior is shifted from @xmath10 , as found in bulk material , to @xmath116 for thin films .",
    "moreover , the activation energy calculated close to room temperature ( fig.15 ) is larger . for example",

    "this result is not surprising knowing that a high number of vacancies is characteristic for this material .",
    "a random field caused by vacant sites can produce localization of the electrons near the fermi level just like in amorphous materials .",

    "can be calculated from the values of @xmath142 .",
    "these parameters are tabulated in table 1 together with the corresponding @xmath12 values . clearly , one can observe that for @xmath133 sample the density of localized states at the fermi level is high and starts to decrease with increasing the oxygen content .",
    "the transport properties of vo@xmath0 can not be understood on the basis of a simple band picture , because the material should have been metallic . shortly after the publication of banus et al .",
    ", two papers by goodenough @xcite and mott @xcite appeared , in which explanations were given in terms of electron correlation effects and vacancies .",
    "both authors assume a finite hubbard u , which is large enough to split the @xmath6 band .",
    "because v@xmath158 supplies @xmath159 electrons to the @xmath6 band , the valence band of vo is given by a completely filled lower hubbard band , separated by a gap from the conduction band which is the empty upper hubbard band .",
    "according to mott @xcite , the random field produced by the vacancies causes anderson localization @xcite in the overlap region of the two hubbard bands .",
    "this explains why the conductivity in vo@xmath0 is of the variable range hopping type at low temperatures . in goodenough s model",
    "@xcite the effect of the vacancies on the electronic structure is discussed much more explicitly .",
    "he assumes a high degree of trapping of electron and holes near anion and cation vacancies , respectevely . in this way",
    "the fermi - level stays near the minimum in the dos of vo@xmath0 , explaining its semiconductor - like behavior .",
    "the transition to a more itinerant behavior for @xmath128 is attributed to a tail in the trapped electron distribution .",
    "a second effect of the trapping of charges near vacancies is that the loss of madelung energy is limited .",
    "the presence of a large number of vacancies in vo@xmath0 remains one of the most puzzling characteristics .",
    "the only two other binary oxides showing this behavior are the rocksalts tio@xmath0 and nbo , with nbo having about @xmath160 vacancies @xcite .",
    "apparently the creation of vacancies stabilizes the crystal by reducing the gibbs free energy . according to goodenough @xcite",
    "the formation of vacancies leads to a reduction in the lattice constant , thereby broadening the @xmath6 bands .",
    "the resulting stabilization of the occupied valence band states is counteracted by a reduction in madelung energy , but this energy loss is assumed to be minimized by a localization of the charge compensating electrons and holes near the oxygen and vanadium vacancies respectively .",
    "he argues that the application of hydrostatic pressure should reduce the vacancy concentration considerably and he refers to experiments giving indirect evidence in favor of this effect @xcite .",
    "the vo@xmath0 films we have grown epitaxially on mgo substrates are thin enough to be coherent with the substrate and are under tensile stress .",
    "in fact , the in - plane lattice constant is expanded ( @xmath43@xmath161 ) , while the out - of - plane lattice constant is reduced due to the poisson effect . applying goodenough s vacancy induced lattice contraction arguments",
    ", we would expect that the formation of vacancies will not be less favored in our thin film , because the lattice constant of the film is fixed by the substrate , thus preventing the energy gain to occur that otherwise is associated with the lattice contraction and broadening of the @xmath6 bands .",
    "in contrast to this expectation , however , we found that both the cation and anion concentration are not much affected . for stoichiometric vo film ,",
    "the values are even slightly higher ( of the order of @xmath15 or @xmath162 ) than for bulk material .",
    "we agree with goodenough , nevertheless , that the mechanism for vacancy formation must be searched for in terms of energy arguments . to our knowledge ,",
    "_ ab - initio _ total energy calculations have not yet been carried out to study the stability of vacancy formation in this material .",
    "we may speculate about the mechanism by reviewing goodenough s arguments @xcite .",
    "goodenough starts with the picture that electrons and holes are being trapped near the cation and anion vacancies , as to avoid part of the madelung energy loss .",
    "the @xmath6 orbitals of cations neighboring a cation vacancy are then destabilized by a reduced bonding to neighboring @xmath6 orbitals and a stronger @xmath163 bonding to the @xmath164 orbitals next to the vacancy , thereby raising their energy above the fermi level . on the other hand , near an oxygen vacancy",
    "the bonding @xmath6 orbitals are stabilized , whereas the @xmath103 and @xmath165 orbitals are less destabilized by the absence of oxygen @xmath166 orbitals at the vacant site .",
    "these effects contribute to the stabilization energy of vacancies , but not enough . instead of looking for a possible further energy gain in the @xmath6 band due to",
    "lattice contraction induced band broadening , we now discuss what low symmetry ligand fields can do to lower the energy of the occupied @xmath6 , motivated by the fact that the xas measurements reveal that those ligand fields are very strong in vo@xmath0 , i.e. with a strength of the order of several hundreds mev .",
    "we will first discuss the case of oxygen vacancies .",
    "neighboring divalent @xmath16 metal ions are surrounded by five oxygen ligands in a square pyramidal arrangement with c@xmath167 symmetry .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath168 levels will be split into three non- and one doubly degenerate levels , respectively .",
    "with two electrons being trapped at or near the vacancy , we have one extreme possibility in that both electrons are trapped at the vacant site , forming an @xmath169-center , and the other possibility in that the excess electrons are trapped at neighboring @xmath170-metal sites . assuming that at least a fraction of the excess electrons resides at the @xmath170-metal ions",
    ", the average number of @xmath170 electrons will be larger than three for v - ions next to a vacancy . in both cases",
    "some ligand field stabilization energy is gained , owing to the electrons occupying the lower @xmath168 level in vo@xmath171 .",
    "considering now the case of @xmath170 metal vacancies , we may speculate that two excess holes are trapped near these vacancies in vo@xmath172 .",
    "one extreme possibility is that the holes are residing at oxygen neighbors .",
    "following a suggestion of elfimov et al .",
    "@xcite , this would give a stable configuration in which the holes are in a triplet state localized at the oxygen coordination polyhedron around the vacancy .",
    "however , in contrast to the case of cao discussed by these authors , in a transition metal compound there is also the possibility that the two holes are located at next nearest neighbor transition metal ions .",
    "the presence of the cation vacancy leads to a local symmetry lowering ( c@xmath173 ) at these cation sites .",
    "also in this case a ligand field stabilization is anticipated , because the average number of @xmath170 electrons on @xmath170-metal ions next to a vacancy will be less than three for v.    although , as was argued above , the decrease of direct overlap between @xmath6 orbitals in the strained films does not have a major effect on the concentration of vacancies , it will change the band structure in the valence band region and consequently change the electrical properties . expanding",
    "the lattice by epitaxial growth on a substrate with a larger lattice constant like mgo will decrease the bandwidth and therefore increase the gap .",
    "this explains the lower conductivity and higher room temperature activation energies found in our films . in the models proposed by goodenough @xcite and mott @xcite , the on - site coulomb interaction u is assumed to open up a small energy gap in the itinerant @xmath6 band .",
    "it is assumed that overlapping tails of localized states , which are related to the disorder associated with the large number of defects in the system , are present at the edges of these hubbard bands . in this way",
    "mott @xcite explains why in bulk samples the conductivity vs temperature is semiconductor - like at high temperature , but is better described by a variable range hopping mechanism at low temperatures .",
    "the conductivity results for our films are consistent with this explanation .",
    "the main difference is that the resistivity and apparent activation energies of the films are much higher , and that the transition from semiconducting to metallic behavior is shifted to lower @xmath12 values , i.e. from @xmath124 in bulk samples to @xmath174 in films .",
    "we have successfully grown epitaxial vo@xmath0 films on mgo(100 ) substrates . up to at least 120",
    "the growth is coherent and layer - by - layer - like . @xmath1o@xmath2-rbs",
    "was introduced as a convenient method to determine accurately the stoichiometry of these ultrathin layers .",
    "once the stoichiometry is known , the vacancy concentration of both vanadium and oxygen can be calculated from the time to grow one monolayer as determined from rheed .",
    "the numbers turn out to be very similar to those for the bulk material .",
    "this implies that the formation of a high concentration of vacancies may not be directly related to an increased @xmath6 band width as a result of a vacancy induced lattice contraction .",
    "instead we suggest that a detailed study is required to calculate the possible stabilization due to additional ligand field splittings at the low symmetry metal sites near the vacancies , as observed from xas .",
    "nevertheless , the decrease in direct overlap between @xmath6 orbitals and the concomitant increase of the size of the pseudo - gap between the lower and upper @xmath6 hubbard bands is held responsible for the much larger electrical resistivity in strained vo@xmath0 films .",
