    "cern na62 experiment  @xcite aims to measure the ultra - rare charged kaon decay @xmath4 ( branching fraction @xmath5  @xcite with a 10% accuracy .",
    "the detector should efficiently suppress all the backgrounds with a signature similar to the one of the main decay channel .",
    "one of the main backgrounds to be suppressed is coming from the abundant @xmath6 decay .",
    "the main task of the na62 rich detector is to separate pions from muons in the momentum range 1535 gev / c with a @xmath3-misidentification factor better than @xmath0 .",
    "in addition to that , it should provide the crossing time of the pion with a resolution better than 100 ps , and an input to level 0 and level 1 of the trigger .",
    "the important information given by the rich is the number of the photomultiplier ( pm ) hits , the ring radius , the center of the ring , and the time of the charged particle .",
    "the test resolution , the light collection technique and , even if biased by the small number of pms , the cherenkov angle and the track angular resolutions were checked in a test beam in 2007  @xcite .",
    "the pion  muon separation capability of the rich detector prototype equipped with about 400 pms ( rich-400 prototype ) was tested in a dedicated run in 2009  @xcite .",
    "the prototype was built as a long tube ( about 18 m , and a diameter of about 60 cm ) filled with neon ( ne ) at atmospheric pressure and room temperature , equipped with a spherical mirror ( 17 m focal length ) at the downstream end and with 414 pms at the upstream end .",
    "the detector response was tested using a positive hadron beam of variable momentum ( in the range 10 - 75 gev / c ) , with a spread of about 1% and a divergence of about 30 @xmath7 . at the prototype position it was composed of @xmath8",
    ", @xmath9 , p , @xmath10 with fractions changing with the selected momentum , and a small amount of @xmath11 from @xmath9 decays .",
    "two different mirrors were tested , both produced by the marcon company .",
    "one of the mirrors was aluminized and coated with mgf2 by the supplier in 2008 , while the latter was aluminized and coated with sio2 and hfo2 at cern in 2009 in an attempt to improve the total mirror reflectivity .",
    "a small difference of about 1% in favour of the new mirror in the number of hit pms was observed .",
    "the rich operational range starts above a wavelength of 190 nm and above this value no visible absorption of the light is expected due to the contaminants .",
    "however , the impurities change the refractive index of the radiator which could affect the cherenkov angle and its resolution . some tests with oxygen and @xmath2  fractions up to 1% were done to check the performance of the detector .",
    "the data were taken at different momenta , with a beam centered on the mirror at a position ( x = 0 , y = 0 ) . during 2009 ,",
    "several runs with polluted neon were taken as a part of the rich-400 test beam programme .",
    "two of them were taken with an oxygen pollution of 380 ppm and 425 ppm . in these runs ,",
    "the old mirror produced by marcon was used . after changing the mirror with a new one , with improved aluminized coating ,",
    "new tests with polluted ne were performed .",
    "the gas used for the pollution was @xmath2 .",
    "four runs were taken for both 0.5% pollution and 1.0% pollution with @xmath2 .",
    "the beam momentum of the charged particle for these special runs was fixed at 20.0 , 26.5 , 35.0 , and 46.3 gev / c .",
    "the data were compared to a dedicated mc simulation based on geant 4 .",
    "all the known efficiencies were taken into account : quartz window transparency , pm quantum efficiency , mirror reflectivity , winston cones efficiency .",
    "a detailed geometry description is implemented . in the simulation ,",
    "the rich vessel is put in air , and the pion or the electron beam at a given momentum is shot about 6 meters before its window .",
    "the mirror reflectivity implemented in the simulation is the one of the old mirror .",
    "this is an important remark , as the runs with @xmath2  pollution are taken with the new mirror .",
    "the two data runs with oxygen pollution of 380 ppm and 425 ppm were taken at 46.3 gev / c pion momentum . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , these two measurements are hardly distinguishable from the non - polluted data runs .",
    "it can be concluded that the oxygen contamination did not affect the number of pm hits , and therefore there is no absorption effect for these amounts of oxygen .",
    "the data and mc simulation distributions of the ring radius and of the hit multiplicity for non - polluted ne were compared , in order to validate the mc simulation . in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] , the number of hit pms is plotted versus the ring radius for pions and electrons at 20.0 , 23.4 , 26.5 , 28.7,31.0 , 35.0 , 38.0 , 41.0 , 46.3 am 50.3 gev / c beam momentum .",
    "the runs with ne contaminated with @xmath2  were taken at 20.0 , 26.5 , 38.0 and 46.3 gev / c .",
    "the different momenta correspond to different ring radius for pions ( the ring radius increases with the momentum ) , but for electrons , as @xmath12 , the ring radius is always the same equals 1 , the ring radius for electrons is always the maximum possible one , and they are clearly distinguishable . ] .",
    "the ring radius is @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the focal length of the spherical mirror , and @xmath15 is the cherenkov angle ( the angle between the emitted cherenkov radiation and the particle path ) .",
    "the cherenkov angle is related to the velocity by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the refractive index of the medium , and @xmath18 is the velocity of the charged particle .              the data taken with and without pollution , together with the mc simulation are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . the number of hit pms increases with the ring radius ( and with the momentum ) . the data with the non - contaminated radiator is used as a reference of the quality of the overall data and mc simulation agreement",
    "the effect of the pollution on the ring radius is clearly visible : for 1% of @xmath2  in the radiator gas the ring radius is 2.7% larger ( measured with electrons ) .    for the mc simulation of the @xmath2   polluted data , a new radiator , with a new refractive index was introduced in the geant 4 simulation , according to the amount of @xmath2  used for the different runs .",
    "the refractive index @xmath17 is calculated as @xmath19    for ne , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while for @xmath2  these values are @xmath22 @xmath23  @xcite . in case of mixing ne with @xmath2 , a linear combination was used for the final refractive index @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the amount of @xmath2   used , and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the wavelength from 190 to 620 nm  @xcite ] .",
    "while for data and mc simulation the agreement on the ring radius for the positrons data with no pollution in ne , and with 1.0% @xmath2  pollution , in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] is good , the disagreement on the ring radius for positrons data and mc taken with 0.5% @xmath2  pollution is clearly visible .",
    "one of the reasons for such disagreement of the ring radii could be a beam with a slightly different momenta than the nominal one .",
    "however , this would not give effect for positrons for which @xmath12 .",
    "from the pion data ( fig .  [ fig:4 ] ) , the biggest discrepancies for the ring radii of the pions is also found for the 0.5% @xmath2  pollution data . in order to explain this mismatch ,",
    "a hypothesis was made , that the amount of the pollution is different from the measured one .",
    "a test of the correlation of the ring radius and the amount of @xmath2  in the ne was made by using mc simulation .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the correlation of the @xmath2  pollution and the ring radius was measured for positrons ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , right ) and for pions at 35 gev / c ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , left ) .",
    "this analysis has shown that the discrepancy in the measured ring radius can be explained with a bigger amount of @xmath2  in the ne and that it is more likely that the ne gas is contaminated with 0.6% @xmath2 .",
    "this is compatible with the fact that during the test beam , the amount of @xmath2  filled in the vessel was controlled by hand as the less significant bit on the apparatus scale was 0.1% .         in fig .",
    "[ fig:7 ] , mc data for 0.6% @xmath2  are plotted , and a better agreement of the test beam data with the simulation is visible .        as a final step to improve the agreement ,",
    "the data with the new mirror for the non polluted runs are added to the plot ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] ) .",
    "as mentioned before , the efficiency of the old mirror is used in the simulation . the comparison between data and mc simulation",
    "is done for runs taken with the old mirror .",
    "however , the @xmath2  polluted runs were taken with the new mirror . by adding the non - polluted runs with the new mirror",
    ", it is shown that the new mirror has a slightly better reflectivity efficiency . therefore ,",
    "if this efficiency is included in the simulation instead the efficiency of the old mirror , we can expect that the number of hit pms for the polluted data will be slightly increased leading to a better agreement of data and mc for these runs , especially for lower momenta .",
    "the effect of the pollution on the ring radius resolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] .",
    "the data for 0 , 0.5% , and 1.0% @xmath2  are plotted with black , red and green dots , correspondingly .",
    "then , two sets of mc simulation were added : one generated with beam momentum resolution of 1% ( empty circles with the same color scheme for @xmath2  pollution as above ) , and one generated with beam momentum resolution of 1.7%(black , red and green triangles ) .",
    "the runs used for this study are at 20.0 , 26.5 , 38.0 and 46.3 gev / c .",
    "no absorption effect on the number of pm hits is observed in several runs taken with polluted ne gas radiator during the rich-400 testbeam .",
    "however , an effect on the ring radius is clearly observed . for a radiator pollution with 1.0% of @xmath2 , an effect of 2.7% on the ring radius",
    "this observation is confirmed by mc simulation .",
    "the data which were assumed to be taken with 0.5% of @xmath2  are well reproduced by mc simulation with ne radiator with 0.6% contamination of @xmath2 .",
    "the measurement of the amount of the @xmath2  could be affected by the limited apparatus precision .",
    "the conclusion from these studies is that it is important to know the amount of @xmath2  in the final detector . in order to easily apply a correction to the ring radius",
    ", @xmath28 data can be used for additional calibration . if the amount of @xmath2  is not known , the quality of the pion identification could be seriously compromised .",
