    "self - gravitating degenerate neutrino matter has been suggested as a model for quasars , with neutrino masses in the 0.2 kev @xmath5 0.5 mev range @xcite even before the black hole hypothesis of the quasars was conceived @xcite .",
    "more recently , supermassive compact dark objects consisting of weakly interacting degenerate fermionic matter , with fermion masses in the 10 @xmath6/kev @xmath7 20 range , have been proposed @xcite as an alternative to the supermassive black holes that are believed to reside at the centers of many galaxies .",
    "the masses of @xmath0 20 supermassive compact dark objects at the centers of inactive galaxies @xcite have been measured so far . the most massive compact dark object ever observed",
    "is located at the center of m87 in the virgo cluster , and it has a mass of @xmath0 3 @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xcite .",
    "ngc 3115 , ngc 4594 and ngc 4374 are galaxies harbouring compact dark objects with the next smaller mass of @xmath0 10@xmath9 .",
    "if we identify the object of maximal mass with a degenerate fermion ball at the oppenheimer - volkoff ( ov ) limit @xcite , i.e. @xmath10 = 0.54@xmath11 3 @xmath8 10@xmath9 @xcite , where @xmath12 , this allows us to fix the fermion mass to @xmath13 15 kev for a spin and particle - antiparticle degeneracy factor of @xmath14 = 2 .",
    "such a relativistic object would have a radius of @xmath15 = 4.45 @xmath16 1.5 light days , where @xmath17 is the schwarzschild radius of the mass @xmath10 .",
    "it would thus be virtually indistinguishable from a black hole of the same mass , as the closest stable orbit around a black hole has a radius of 3 @xmath17 anyway .    at the lower end of the observed mass range are the compact dark objects located at the center of ngc 4945 , m32 and our galaxy @xcite with masses of about 1,3 and 2.6 million solar masses , respectively . interpreting the galactic object as a degenerate fermion ball consisting of @xmath18 15 kev and @xmath14 = 2 fermions ,",
    "the radius is @xmath19 21 light - days @xmath13 7 @xmath8 10@xmath20 @xcite , @xmath17 being the schwarzschild radius of the mass @xmath21 = 2.6 @xmath8 10@xmath22 .",
    "such a nonrelativistic object is far from being a black hole .     and",
    "@xmath23 = 340 km s@xmath24 , @xmath25 = - 1190 km s@xmath24 and @xmath2 = 0 in 1995.4 . ]    the observed motion of stars within a projected distance of @xmath0 5 to @xmath0 50 light - days from sgr a@xmath1 @xcite , the powerful and enigmatic radio source at the galactic center , yields , apart from the mass , an upper limit for the radius of the fermion ball @xmath26 22 light days .",
    "matter orbiting in an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk in or around such a fermion ball will only emit radiation at distances larger than @xmath0 10 mpc from the center , as both the density and the circular frequency become nearly constant near the center of the fermion ball @xcite .",
    "the spectrum emitted by the disk will thus have a cut - off at frequencies larger than @xmath0 10@xmath27 hz , as is actually observed .",
    "of course , there will be a pile - up and instability of matter within @xmath0 10 mpc , perhaps leading to the formation of stars , as the gravitational tidal forces on nascent stars is much smaller in the fermion ball than in the black hole scenario .",
    "these stars may be eventually ejected from the central star cluster by intruder stars in close binary encounters .",
    "the formation of such a fermion ball as well as its coexistence at finite temperature with a galactic halo composed of the same fermions has been discussed by lindebaum @xcite and bili @xcite respectively , at this conference .     and @xmath23 = 340 km s@xmath24 , @xmath25 = - 1190 km s@xmath24 and @xmath2 = 0 in 1995.4 . ]    the required weakly interacting fermion of @xmath0 15 kev mass can not be an active neutrino , as it would overclose the universe by orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath0 15 kev fermion could very well be a sterile neutrino , contributing @xmath28 0.3 to the dark matter fraction of the critical density today .",
    "indeed , as has been shown for an initial lepton asymmetry of @xmath0 10@xmath29 , a sterile neutrino of mass @xmath0 10 kev may be resonantly produced in the early universe with near closure density , i.e. @xmath30 1 @xcite . as an alternative possibility , the required @xmath0 15 kev fermion could be the axino @xcite or the gravitino @xcite in soft supersymmetry breaking scenarios .",
    "we now would like to compare the predictions of the black hole and fermion ball scenarios of the galactic center , for the stars with the smallest projected distances to sgr a@xmath1 , based on the measurements of their positions during the last six years @xcite .",
    "the projected orbits of three stars , s0 - 1 ( s1 ) , s0 - 2 ( s2 ) and s0 - 4 ( s8 ) , show deviations from uniform motion on a straight line during the last six years , and they thus may contain nontrivial information about the potential . for our analysis we have selected the star , s0 - 1 , because its projected distance from sgr a@xmath1 in 1995.53 , 4.4 mpc or 5.3 light - days , makes it most likely that it could be orbiting within a fermion ball of radius @xmath0 18 mpc or @xmath0 21 light - days .",
    "we thus may in principle distinguish between the black hole and fermion ball scenarios for this star .",
    "the dynamics of the stars in the gravitational field of the supermassive compact dark object can be studied solving newton s equation of motion , taking into account the initial position and velocity vectors at , e.g. , @xmath31 = 1995.4 yr , i.e. , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . for the fermion ball",
    "the source of gravitational field is the mass @xmath34 enclosed within a radius @xmath35 @xcite while for the black hole it is @xmath36 = 2.6 @xmath8 10@xmath22 .",
    "the @xmath37-axis is chosen in the direction opposite to the right ascension ( ra ) , the @xmath38-axis in the direction of the declination , and the @xmath3-axis points towards the sun .",
    "the black hole and the center of the fermion ball are assumed to be at the position of sgr a@xmath1 which is also the origin of the coordinate system at an assumed distance of 8 kpc from the sun .    in figs .",
    "1 and 2 the right ascension ( ra ) and declination of s0 - 1 are plotted as a function of time for various unobservable @xmath3 s and @xmath2 = 0 in 1995.4 , in the black hole and fermion ball scenarios .",
    "the velocity components @xmath23 = 340 km s@xmath24 and @xmath25 = - 1190 km s@xmath24 in 1995.4 have been fixed from observations . in the case of a black hole , both ra and declination depend strongly on @xmath3 in 1995.4 , while the @xmath3-dependence of these quantities in the fermion ball scenario is rather weak .",
    "we conclude that the ra and declination data of s0 - 1 are well fitted with @xmath39 0.25  in the black hole scenario , and with @xmath40 0.1  in the fermion ball case ( 1  = 38.8 mpc = 46.2 light - days at 8 kpc ) . of course",
    ", we can also try to fit the data varying both the unknown radial velocity @xmath2 and the unobservable radial distance @xmath3 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "3 , where the @xmath4 phase - space of 1995.4 , that fits the data , is shown .",
    "the small range of acceptable @xmath41 and @xmath42 values in the black hole scenario ( solid vertical line ) reflects the fact that the orbit of s0 - 1 depend strongly on @xmath3 .",
    "the weak sensitivity of the orbit on @xmath3 in the fermion ball case is the reason for the much larger @xmath4 phase - space fitting the data of s0 - 1 @xcite , as shown by the dashed box .",
    "the dashed and solid curves describe the just bound orbits in the fermion ball and black hole scenarios , respectively . the star s0 - 1 is unlikely to be unbound , because in the absence of close encounters with stars of the central cluster , s0 - 1 would have to fall in with an initial velocity that is inconsistent with the velocity dispersion of the stars at infinity .",
    "phase space that fits the s0 - 1 data .",
    ", scaledwidth=90.0% ]    fig .",
    "4 shows some typical projected orbits of s0 - 1 in the black hole and fermion ball scenarios .",
    "the data of s0 - 1 may be fitted in both scenarios with appropriate choices of @xmath43 and @xmath2 in 1995.4 .",
    "the inclination angles of the orbit s plane , @xmath44 = arccos ( @xmath45 ) , with @xmath46 , are shown next to the orbits . the minimal inclination angle that describes the data in the black hole case is @xmath44 = 70@xmath47 , while in the fermion ball scenario it is @xmath44 = 0@xmath47 . in the black hole case ,",
    "the minimal and maximal distances from sgr a@xmath1 are @xmath48 = 0.25  and @xmath49 = 0.77  , respectively , for the orbit with @xmath3 = 0.25  and @xmath2 = 0 which has a period of @xmath50 161 yr . the orbits with @xmath3 = 0.25  and @xmath2 = 400 km s@xmath24 or @xmath3 = 0.25  and @xmath2 = 700 km s@xmath24 have periods @xmath51 268 yr or @xmath51 3291 yr , respectively .",
    "in the fermion ball scenario , the open orbit with @xmath3 = 0.1  and @xmath2 = 0 has a `` period '' of @xmath50 77 yr with @xmath48 = 0.13  and @xmath49 = 0.56  . the open orbits with @xmath3 = 0.1  and @xmath2 = 400 km s@xmath24 or @xmath3 = 0.1  and @xmath2 = 900 km s@xmath24 have `` periods '' of @xmath51 100 yr or @xmath51 1436 yr , respectively .",
    "a fermion ball at the galactic center could be indirectly observed through the radiative decay of the fermion ( assumed here to be a sterile neutrino ) into a standard neutrino , i.e. @xmath52 . if the lifetime for the decay @xmath53 is 2.6 @xmath8 10@xmath54 yr , the luminosity of a @xmath21 = 2.6 @xmath8 10@xmath22 fermion ball would be 2.8 @xmath8 10@xmath55 erg s@xmath24 .",
    "this is consistent with the upper limit of the x - ray luminosity for the quiescent - state @xmath0 2.8 @xmath8 10@xmath55 erg s@xmath24 of the source with radius 0.5  @xmath13 23 light - days , whose center nearly coincides with sgr a@xmath1 , as seen by the chandra satellite in the 2 to 7 kev band @xcite .",
    "the lifetime is proportional to sin@xmath56 @xmath44 , @xmath44 being the unknown mixing angle of the sterile with active neutrinos . with a lifetime of 2.6 @xmath8 10@xmath54",
    "yr we obtain an acceptable value for the mixing angle squared of @xmath57 = 0.44 @xmath8 10@xmath58 .",
    "the x - rays originating from such a radiative decay would contribute at least two orders of magnitude less than the observed diffuse x - ray background luminosity at this wavelength if the sterile neutrino is the dark matter particle of the universe .",
    "the signal observed at the galactic center would be a sharp x - ray line at @xmath0 7.5 kev for @xmath14 = 2 and @xmath0 6.3 kev for @xmath14 = 4 .",
    "this line could thus be misinterpreted as the fe @xmath59 line at 6.67 kev .",
    "the x - ray luminosity would be tracing the fermion matter distribution , and it could thus be an important test of the fermion ball scenario . of course the angular resolution would need to be @xmath7 0.1  and the sensitivity would have to extend beyond 7 kev .    in the fermion ball scenario , the @xmath0 10 ks x - ray burst observed on 26 october 2000 near sgr a@xmath1 would have to be explained as a thermonuclear instability or runaway of material accreted or accreting on a neutron star near the center of the fermion ball . with a neutron star accretion rate of @xmath0 10@xmath60/yr , this could also account for the strong radio emission of sgr a@xmath1 in terms of synchroton radiation due to @xmath0 50 mev electrons and positrons , produced in @xmath61 decays , after inelastic @xmath62 collisions of the infalling @xmath0 200 mev nucleons hitting the surface of the neutron star",
    ". as accreting matter can easily spin up or slow down the rotation of neutron stars , it is perhaps also able to keep the neutron star stationary at the center of the fermion ball for an extended period of time .    in summary , it is important to note that , based on the data of the star s0 - 1 @xcite alone , the fermion ball scenario can not be ruled out .",
    "similar results are obtained analyzing the s0 - 2 data @xcite .",
    "in fact , in view of the @xmath4 phase - space , that is much larger in the fermion ball scenario than in the black hole case for both the s0 - 1 and s0 - 2 data , there is a reason to treat the fermion ball scenario of the supermassive compact dark object at the center of our galaxy with the respect it deserves .",
