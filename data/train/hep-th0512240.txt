    "d3 branes living at the singularity of a calabi - yau cone have provided general and interesting results for the ads / cft correspondence since its early days .",
    "the ir limit of the gauge theory on the world volume of the d3-branes is dual to type iib string theory on the near horizon geometry @xmath2 , where the horizon manifold @xmath3 is the compact base of the cone @xcite .",
    "since the cone is calabi - yau , @xmath3 has a sasaki - einstein metric . until few months ago , the only known sasaki - einstein metrics were the round sphere @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the horizon of the conifold .",
    "recently , various infinite classes of new sasaki - einstein metrics were constructed @xcite and named @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the corresponding dual gauge theories were determined @xcite .",
    "the remarkable growth in the number of explicit examples was accompanied by a deeper general understanding of the correspondence , in particular when the calabi - yau cone is a toric manifold .",
    "the ads / cft correspondence predicts a precise relation between the central charge @xmath0 , the scaling dimensions of some operators in the cft on the d3-branes and the volumes of @xmath3 and of certain submanifolds .",
    "checks of this relation have been done for the known sasaki - einstein metrics @xcite .",
    "it is by now clear that all these checks can be done without an explicit knowledge of the metric .",
    "a - maximization @xcite provides an efficient tool for computing central and r - charges on the quantum field theory side . on the other hand ,",
    "z - minimization @xcite provides a geometrical method for extracting volumes from the toric data . in this note",
    "we review the proof of the equivalence between a - maximization and z - minimization given in @xcite . in this process",
    ", we provide a general formula for assigning r - charges and multiplicities for the chiral fields of the quiver gauge theory based only on toric data .",
    "our result is a quantitative check of the ads / cft correspondence that can be performed for all toric manifolds .",
    "since our work @xcite appeared , the long standing problem of finding the correspondence between toric singularities and quiver gauge theories has been completely solved using dimer technology .",
    "the brane tilings @xcite provide an ingenious way of reconstructing the toric cone from the quiver ; the inverse , and more complicated , problem of computing the gauge theory from the toric diagram has been recently solved using zig - zag paths in @xcite , and nicely interpreted in @xcite .",
    "now that we have an algorithm for determining the quiver gauge theory from the toric data , it is important to study the distribution of r - charges among the chiral fields of the gauge theory .",
    "this information is not important for determining the value of the central charge and the r - charges but it is certainly important for a better understanding of the cft . in this note",
    "we discuss in details how to find the precise distribution of r - charges in the quiver gauge theory using dimers and zig - zag paths .",
    "we consider @xmath8 d3-branes living at the tip of a cy cone .",
    "the base of the cone , or horizon , is a five - dimensional sasaki - einstein manifold @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 gauge theory living on the branes is superconformal and dual in the ads / cft correspondence to the type iib background @xmath2 , which is the near horizon geometry .    as well known , the matter content of the gauge theory can be represented by a quiver diagram , where each node represents a gauge group and oriented links represent chiral bifundamental multiplets . to complete the description of the gauge theory",
    "one must specify also the superpotential . by applying seiberg dualities to a quiver gauge theory",
    "we can obtain different quivers that flow in the ir to the same cft .",
    "it turns out that one can always find phases where all the gauge groups have the same number of colors ; these are called toric phases . for toric phases , and when the dual geometry is toric , one can `` lift '' the quiver diagram and draw it on a torus @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this diagram , called the periodic quiver , identifies completely the gauge theory , since now every superpotential term in the gauge theory is described by a face : it is the trace of the product of chiral fields of the face .",
    "the dual graph of the periodic quiver , known as the brane tiling or dimer configuration , is still drawn on a torus @xmath11 ( look at figure [ y21 ] for the example @xmath12 ) . in the dimer the role of faces and vertices is exchanged : faces are gauge groups and vertices are superpotential terms .",
    "the dimer is a bipartite graph : it has an equal number of white and black vertices and links connect only vertices of different colors .",
    "the first prediction of the correspondence we want to check is the relation between the central charge in field theory and the volume of the internal manifold @xcite : @xmath13 the second quantitative prediction states that the exact r - charges of chiral fields @xmath14 are proportional to volumes of certain calibrated 3d submanifolds @xmath15 inside @xmath3 @xcite : @xmath16 recall in fact that the baryon operator built with @xmath14 is dual to a d3 brane wrapped over @xmath15 and equation ( [ baryons ] ) is the relation between the scaling dimension of the operator and the mass of the state in the string dual .",
    "we will denote with @xmath17 the number of vertices of the periodic quiver ( gauge groups ) , with @xmath18 the number of edges ( chiral fields ) , and with @xmath19 the number of faces ( superpotential terms ) .",
    "since the periodic quiver is drawn on a torus , the euler relation implies @xcite : @xmath20    the r - charges @xmath21 of the chiral fields @xmath14 , @xmath22 , satisfy a set of linear constraints : since we are looking for the infrared fixed points of the gauge theory , each term in the superpotential must have r - charge @xmath23 ( @xmath19 equations ) and the exact nsvz @xmath24 function for every gauge group must be zero ( @xmath17 equations ) .",
    "the latter condition coincides with the anomaly cancellation for the r - symmetry .",
    "it seems from ( [ eul ] ) that @xmath25 linear conditions will determine uniquely the @xmath18 unknown charges @xmath21 .",
    "however , in the cases we are interested in , the conditions are not linearly independent : it is easy to see that the homogeneous part of the linear system is just solved by the global non anomalous @xmath26 charges for chiral fields , so that a generic r - symmetry is mixed with the global non anomalous symmetries : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a particular solution , the @xmath29 are the global symmetries , and @xmath30 are real parameters .    the important fact is that , in general , we expect @xmath31 global non anomalous symmetries , where @xmath32 is the number of sides of the toric diagram in the dual theory .",
    "we can count these symmetries from the number of massless vectors in the @xmath33 dual . since the manifold is toric , the metric has three @xmath26 isometries .",
    "one of these ( generated by the reeb vector ) corresponds to the r - symmetry while the other two give two global flavor symmetries in the gauge theory .",
    "other gauge fields in @xmath33 come from the reduction of the rr four form on the non - trivial three - cycles in the horizon manifold @xmath3 , and there are @xmath34 three - cycles in homology @xcite when @xmath3 is smooth . on the field theory side , these gauge fields correspond to baryonic symmetries . summarizing ,",
    "the global non anomalous symmetries are : @xmath35    at the fixed point , only one of the possible non - anomalous r - symmetries ( [ poss ] ) enters in the superconformal algebra .",
    "it is the one in the same multiplet as the stress - energy tensor .",
    "the value of the exact r - charges at the fixed point can be found by using the a - maximization technique @xcite .",
    "as shown in @xcite , we have to maximize the trial a - charge @xcite : @xmath36 when r ranges over the possible symmetries ( [ poss ] ) ; the value of this function at the maximum gives the central charge , and the position of the maximum gives the exact r - charges . in ( [ ans ] )",
    "the trace is a sum over all the fermionic components of the multiplets .",
    "web for @xmath37 . ]        web for @xmath37 . ]    every toric cy cone in six dimensions is described by a toric diagram @xmath37 , which is simply a convex polygon in the plane with integers vertices ( figure [ polygon ] ) , encoding in a simple diagrammatic way many information about the toric action .",
    "toric diagrams equivalent up to translations and @xmath38 transformations describe the same manifold .",
    "moreover for every convex polygon with integer vertices there exists a unique singular calabi - yau metric over the corresponding toric cone",
    ". therefore toric diagrams identify completely the geometry . if the sides of the toric diagram do not pass through integer points",
    "the horizon @xmath3 is smooth ; here and in the following we shall restrict to this case ( but it is not difficult to extend the results to the general case @xcite ) .    another fact from toric geometry we shall use is that there is a correspondence between vertices @xmath39 of the toric diagram @xmath37 and calibrated 3d submanifolds @xmath15 of @xmath3 ( those appearing in equation ( [ baryons ] ) ) .",
    "it is sometime useful to think in terms of @xmath40 webs .",
    "the @xmath40 web is obtained by taking the perpendiculars to the vectors @xmath41 of the toric diagram with the same length as in @xmath37 , see figure [ pqweb ] .",
    "both the sides of @xmath37 and the vectors of the @xmath40 web .",
    "in fact they differ only by a rotation of @xmath42 .",
    "] let us also define the symbol : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are two vectors in the plane of @xmath37 .",
    "some of the data of the gauge theory can be extracted directly from the geometry of the cone . in particular , there exist simple formulae for the number of gauge groups @xmath17 and the total number of chiral bi - fundamental fields @xmath18 @xcite @xmath46 we would like to stress that the expression for @xmath18 is not true in all toric phases , but remarkably , for the gauge theories in consideration , it seems that it exists always one or more toric phases where this formula is true .",
    "we will call these phases minimal , since they are the ones with a minimal number of fields .",
    "we shall consider here only minimal toric phases ( for a conjectured extension to non minimal toric phases see @xcite ) .",
    "generalizing results in the literature similar to ( [ numbers ] ) , in particular see @xcite , the following algorithm for extracting the field theory content and a parametrization of r- or global charges can be proposed @xcite :    * associate with every vertex @xmath39 of the toric diagram @xmath37 a real ( positive ) parameter @xmath47 , @xmath48 .",
    "indexes @xmath49 , @xmath50 are defined modulo @xmath32 . the parameters @xmath47 can be also displaced between the vectors of adjacent sides in the @xmath40 web , see figure [ pqweb ] . *",
    "consider the set @xmath51 of all pairs of vectors @xmath52 in the @xmath40 web ordered in such a way that the first vector @xmath41 can be rotated counter - clockwise to @xmath53 with an angle @xmath54 .",
    "associate with every element of @xmath51 a type of chiral field in the field theory with multiplicity @xmath55 and r - charge equal to @xmath56 .",
    "for example in figure [ pqweb ] the field associated to the pair @xmath57 has r - charge @xmath58 and multiplicity @xmath59 .",
    "+ note that eq .",
    "( [ numbers ] ) for @xmath18 is correctly reproduced .",
    "* impose the linear constraint @xmath60 if you want to parametrize trial r - charges or @xmath61 if you want to parametrize the @xmath31 global charges .",
    "the chiral fields @xmath14 associated with the pair of consecutive vectors @xmath62 with charge @xmath47 were already identified in @xcite : the dibaryon built with @xmath14 is dual to a d3 brane wrapped on the cycle @xmath15 associated with the vertex @xmath39 . the other chiral fields with charges obtained by summing consecutive @xmath47 form dibaryons dual to a d3 brane wrapped over the union of the corresponding @xmath15 .",
    "the results in @xcite lead to a characterization of the global charges : the @xmath34 baryonic charges are those that also satisfy @xmath63 , where @xmath39 are the coordinates of vertices in the plane of @xmath37 .    with this assignment ,",
    "we are able to write an expression for the trial @xmath0 function depending only on the toric diagram : @xmath64 recall that @xmath17 , the number of gauginos , is the double area of the polygon @xmath37 ( [ numbers ] ) . in non minimal toric phases , which have additional fields ,",
    "equation ( [ aext ] ) is still true , since the contribution from additional fields to the trial r - charge cancels @xcite .",
    "we can make several checks of this proposal for the field theory content .",
    "first of all , it is easy to see that the proposal works in all cases where the quiver gauge theory is explicitly known ( @xmath7 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , toric delpezzo ) .",
    "we also explicitly checked on many examples that the proposal is consistent with the general prescription given in @xcite for extracting the quiver gauge theory from the toric data ( see the discussion in section [ zigzag ] ) .",
    "we can also discuss the consistency of our proposal with the general known properties of the @xmath26 symmetries in this kind of theories .",
    "the proposal reproduces , for example , the expected result @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is a general r - charge or global symmetry charge .",
    "moreover , it can be shown @xcite that for the proposed assignment of charges the mixed cubic thooft anomaly for baryonic symmetries is zero : @xmath69 , as we expect from standard arguments in the gravitational dual @xcite .",
    "however the best check of the proposal is that it allows to prove the equivalence of a - maximization and z - minimization , as we shall soon discuss .",
    "it is in general hard to compute the calabi - yau metric corresponding to a particular toric diagram .",
    "however in @xcite it was shown that all the volumes we need can be computed from the toric data , through the process known as volume minimization ( or z - minimization ) , without any explicit knowledge of the metric .",
    "the reason for that is the following : supersymmetric cycles are calibrated and the volumes can be extracted only from the kahler form on the cone . the function z to be minimized is a rational function of two variables @xmath70 , which define a point inside the toric diagram .    here",
    "we review the work of @xcite , reducing their formulas to the plane containing the convex polygon @xmath37 . consider a generic toric diagram @xmath37 and a point @xmath71 allowed to vary inside @xmath37 .",
    ", the vector field generating the u(1 ) isometry associated with the r - symmetry in field theory : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 form a basis for the @xmath74 fibration and @xmath75 . ]",
    "call @xmath76 the vector joining @xmath77 with each vertex @xmath39 . recall that every vertex @xmath39 of the toric diagram is associated with a calibrated submanifold @xmath15 .",
    "let us define the functions : @xmath78 the function to minimize is just @xmath79 .",
    "this is the function @xmath80 in @xcite up to a constant multiplicative factor .",
    "this function is convex inside @xmath37 and therefore has a unique minimum @xmath81 ; the volumes @xmath82 , @xmath83 for the calabi - yau metric are given respectively by the values ( [ volumes ] ) at the minimum @xcite .",
    "now the problems of computing r - charges in field theory and volumes in the geometry have been reduced to two different extremization problems defined only from toric data .",
    "it is therefore possible to prove in the general toric case that the quantities they compute match according to the ads / cft predictions ( [ central ] ) and ( [ baryons ] ) . the general proof is given in @xcite",
    "; here we give only the main ideas and make useful observations .    to facilitate the comparison we define the geometrical function : @xmath84 and the functions : @xmath85 corresponding to the r - charges @xmath21 through equation ( [ baryons ] ) .",
    "the process of z - minimization can be restated as a maximization of @xmath86 with respect to @xmath70 varying in the interior of @xmath37 .",
    "if we call @xmath87 the values of @xmath47 at the local maximum , we have to prove that : @xmath88 f_i(\\bar x , \\bar y)= \\bar a_i \\qquad i=1,\\ldots d \\label{target } \\end{array}\\ ] ] this is a highly non trivial check to perform : a - maximization and z - minimization use different functions and different trial charges ; it is not at all obvious why the result should be the same .",
    "first of all a - maximization is done on a total of @xmath31 independent trial parameters while the volume minimization is done only on two parameters @xmath70 .",
    "the trial central charge @xmath0 is a cubic polynomial in @xmath47 , whereas @xmath89 is a rational function of @xmath70 .",
    "these parameters , in both cases , are somehow related to the possible global symmetries : the reeb vector in the geometry is connected to r - symmetries of the gauge theory and changing the position of @xmath77 in the directions @xmath90 and @xmath91 means adding to the r - symmetry the two flavor global symmetries . in any case , the volume minimization is done by moving only in a two dimensional subspace of the set of global symmetries , while a - maximization is done on the entire space : recall that the trial r - symmetry is mixed with both the two flavor symmetries and the @xmath34 baryonic ones .",
    "therefore we try to decouple the baryon charges from the a - maximization algorithm , performing a - maximization over a two dimensional subspace of parameters .",
    "this subspace is just the space of coordinates @xmath70 of the plane where @xmath37 lies : consider the map from @xmath92 to @xmath93 given by @xmath94 \\hspace{1.4em}(x , y ) \\rightarrow a_i= \\displaystyle \\frac{2 l_i(x , y)}{\\sum_{j=1}^d l_j(x , y)}=f_i(x , y ) \\label{map } \\end{array}\\ ] ] we are parameterizing the trial charges @xmath47 in field theory with the functions ( [ rc ] ) taken at generic points @xmath70 .",
    "it is not difficult to prove that the gradient of the trial central charge along the @xmath34 baryonic directions evaluated on @xmath95 is always zero : @xmath96 where @xmath97 is a baryon charge and where the equality holds for every @xmath70 in the interior of @xmath37 .",
    "therefore we have clarified in which sense the baryonic symmetries decouple from the process of a - maximization .    at this point",
    "we have to compare two functions of @xmath70 : @xmath86 and the field theory trial central charge evaluated on the surface @xmath95 .",
    "remarkably one discovers that they are equal even before maximization : @xmath98 for every @xmath70 inside the interior of @xmath37 .",
    "this shows the equivalence between a - maximization and z - minimization .",
    "the algorithm discussed in section [ geometry ] for extracting the gauge theory content from the toric diagram of the dual theory gives us the multiplicities and the charges of chiral fields , and this is enough to write equation ( [ aext ] ) for the trial @xmath0 charge from the toric diagram , but it does not tell us how the chiral fields are disposed in the periodic quiver ( or in the dimer ) . recently",
    "a general prescription to extract the whole dimer from the toric diagram has been proposed @xcite , @xcite ; as we will soon explain this algorithm is based on zig - zag paths . once the dimer is known , one can try to determine the distribution of trial r - charges and check the algorithm reviewed in section [ geometry ] .",
    "there are two equivalent ways of determining the distribution of r - charges , one already described in @xcite and a second one based on zig - zag paths . here",
    "we will briefly discuss both of them and show their equivalence .",
    "one can check on concrete examples that both prescription give the right distribution of r - charges : the sum of charges for a vertex in the dimer ( superpotential term ) is equal to 2 , and the sum of charges of a face is equal to the number of sides minus 2 ( beta function zero ) .    the first general efficient way to find this distribution , valid for all toric phases ,",
    "was discussed in @xcite : the parameters @xmath47 are associated with vertices of the toric diagram , and to every vertex @xmath39 there corresponds a single perfect matching in the dimer , at least for physical theories @xcite .",
    "therefore the trial charge of a link in the dimer can be computed as the sum of the parameters @xmath47 of all the external perfect matchings ( corresponding to vertices ) to which the link belongs . for examples of how to use this prescription using the kasteleyn matrix ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "a zig - zag path in the dimer is a path of links that turn maximally left at a node , maximally right at the next node , then again maximally left and so on @xcite .",
    "we draw them in the specific case of @xmath12 theory in figure [ y21 ] : they are the four loops in green , yellow , red and blue and they are drawn so that they intersect in the middle of a link as in @xcite . note that every link of the dimer belongs to exactly two different zig - zag paths , oriented in opposite directions .",
    "moreover for dimer representing consistent theories the zig - zag paths are closed non - intersecting loops .",
    "there is a one to one correspondence between zig - zag path and legs of the @xmath40 web : the homotopy class in the fundamental group of the torus of every zig - zag path is just given by the integer numbers @xmath40 of the corresponding leg in the @xmath40 web @xcite .",
    "the reader can check this directly in the example of figure [ y21 ] : we can take as a fundamental cell for the torus one of the regions delimited by the black dashed lines .",
    "indeed the inverse algorithm of @xcite consists just in drawing the zig - zag paths on a fundamental cell with the appropriate homotopy numbers . since there s a one to one correspondence between intersections of zig - zag paths and links in the dimer , equation ( [ numbers ] ) for the total number of fields",
    "is easily explained : recall that the number of topological intersections of two loops with homotopy class @xmath99 and @xmath100 is given by @xmath101 . since equation ( [ numbers ] ) is valid in minimal toric phases of the gauge theory , we suggest that minimal phases can be built by making the effective number of intersections between every pair of closed zig - zag loops equal to the topological number .",
    "non minimal phases , that is those with a greater number of fields than in ( [ numbers ] ) , may be explained with a greater number of effective intersection of zig - zag paths : we checked this in various examples . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on minimal toric phases .",
    "the distribution of charges can be found as following .",
    "consider the two zig - zag paths to which a link in the dimer belongs .",
    "they correspond to two vectors @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the @xmath40 web .",
    "then we propose that the charge of the link is given by the sum of the parameters @xmath104 between the vectors @xmath41 and @xmath53 .",
    "so for instance in figure [ y21 ] the links corresponding to the intersection of the red and the green zig - zag paths ( vectors @xmath105 and @xmath106 in the ( p , q ) web ) have charge equal to @xmath107 .",
    "this rule explains the formula in section [ geometry ] for the multiplicities of fields with a given charge @xmath104 : it counts the number of intersections between the zig zag paths corresponding to @xmath41 and @xmath53 , which is just @xmath108 .    to conclude , we explain the relation with the algorithm for charge distribution based on perfect matchings .",
    "we use a conjecture in @xcite : if we consider the union of the two perfect matchings associated with the consecutive vertices @xmath109 and @xmath110 of @xmath37 we obtain the zig - zag path corresponding to the side @xmath53 plus some other isolated segments belonging to both the perfect matchings : the zig - zag path is the `` formal '' difference of the two perfect matchings . therefore if a link in the dimer belongs to the perfect matching @xmath109 but not to the perfect matching @xmath110 it belongs to the zig - zag path @xmath53 ; while if it belongs to both perfect matchings the link is not on the zig zag path @xmath53 .        with this assumption",
    "it is easy to prove the equivalence of the two algorithms .",
    "consider a link in the dimer at the intersection of two zig - zag paths corresponding to the sides @xmath111 and @xmath53 of the @xmath40 web , as in figure [ proof ] .",
    "since this link belongs to the zig - zag path @xmath111 , it belongs to one of the perfect matchings @xmath112 or @xmath113 but not to both .",
    "suppose it belongs to the perfect matching @xmath113 .",
    "then it is easy to see that it must belong also to the perfect matching @xmath114 : otherwise the link would be in the zig zag path @xmath106 , but this is not possible since the link must belong to exactly two zig - zag paths and it already belongs to the zig - zag paths @xmath111 and @xmath53 . continuing in this way",
    "one can prove that the link belongs to the perfect matchings ( associated with ) @xmath113 , @xmath114 , ",
    "@xmath115 , and so it will be given the charge @xmath116 with both algorithms .",
    "on the contrary if the link belongs to the perfect matching @xmath112 and not @xmath113 , one derives that it belongs to all perfect matchings @xmath117 : such fields may appear in non minimal toric phases @xcite .",
    "this construction is also in agreement with the fact that chiral fields have always charges obtained by summing consecutive parameters @xmath47 .    as an aside we note in figure [ y21 ] that , taking into account also sums of @xmath47 , for every vertex and face in the dimer the charges are in the cyclic order @xmath118 , @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 as in the toric diagram ; vertices are all oriented anticlockwise , and faces are oriented clockwise .",
    "this seems to be a general fact .",
