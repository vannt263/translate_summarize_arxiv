    "the ratio of the dark energy pressure to its energy density , the so - called equation of state ( eos ) parameter , @xmath1 , is nowadays one of the most searched numbers in general relativistic cosmology ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "this is so for at least two diferent reasons .",
    "first , because if one could set @xmath1 to be exactly @xmath2 , then there would be a great probability of identifying the dark energy with the vacuum state of all existing fields in the universe , i.e. , the cosmological constant ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "similarly , if a value @xmath4 ( or a time variation of @xmath1 over the cosmic evolution ) is unambiguously found , then one could not only rule out the cosmological constant but also seriously think of the dark pressure responsible for the current cosmic acceleration as the potential energy density associated with a dynamical scalar field @xmath5 .",
    "the possibility @xmath4 still leads to two diferent routes , i.e. , a quintessence field if @xmath6  @xcite or a phantom component for @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "both cases violate the strong energy condition , @xmath8 , but the latter goes further and also violates the null energy condition , i.e. , @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "clearly , constraining the value @xmath1 from diferent sets of observational data constitutes an important way to improve our understanding of the actual nature of the dark energy . in this regard , finding new methods or reviving old ones that could directly or indirectly quantify the amount of dark energy present in the universe , as well as determine its eos parameter , are important tasks for both theoretical and observational cosmologists .",
    "bounds on @xmath1 have been obtained from observations based on completely distinct physics  @xcite ( see also @xcite and refs . therein ) .",
    "this diversity of technics , as well as combinations among them , is particularly important to a more realiable determination of @xmath1 , since diferent methods may constrain different regions of the parameter space and , therefore , may be complementary to each other .    in this paper , by following the methodology presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , we are particularly interested in deriving the current lookback time ( lt ) versus redshift bounds on the dark energy eos and its density parameter from a sample of 32 passively evolving galaxies , as recently studied by simon _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . the absolute age for these 32 objects",
    "was determined by fitting stellar population models and the sample includes observations from the gemini deep deep survey ( gdds )  @xcite and archival data  @xcite . the same data , along with other age estimates of high-@xmath10 objects , were recently used to reconstruct the shape and redshift evolution of the dark energy potential  @xcite , to place bounds on holography - inspired dark energy scenarios  @xcite , as well as to constrain models of modified gravity  @xcite . here , we focus our analysis on two dark energy models , namely , the standard @xmath3cdm scenario and a flat universe driven by non - relativistic matter ( baryonic + dark ) and a smooth negative - pressure dark energy component ( @xmath1cdm ) . in order to better constrain the parametric spaces for these scenarios , we also combine lt data with the recent measurement of the baryonic acoustic oscillation peak @xcite and the derived age of the universe from current cmb measurements  @xcite .",

    "the lookback time - redshift relation , defined as the difference between the present age of the universe ( @xmath11 ) and its age ( @xmath12 ) when a particular light ray at redshift @xmath10 was emitted , can be written as @xmath13 where @xmath14 gyr and @xmath15 ranges in the hst _ key _ project 1@xmath16 interval @xmath17  @xcite . in the above expression , @xmath18 where @xmath19 , the complete set of parameters is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 and @xmath22 stand for matter , cosmological constant ( @xmath23 ) and dark energy ( @xmath24 ) density parameters , respectively ) , and the subscript @xmath25 denotes present - day quantities .    to proceed further ,",

    "another important aspect concerns the delay factor @xmath45 .",

    ", are essentially based on distance measurements to a particular class of objects or physical rulers ( e.g. , sne ia , cmb , galaxy clusters , etc . ) . in this regard ,",

    "we have shown that lt data may provide bounds on the cosmological parameters with an accuracy competitive with sne ia methods [ see , e.g. , figs .",
