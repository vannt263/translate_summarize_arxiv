    "curve fitting techniques such as the multicolor light  curve  shape ( mlcs ) method of riess , press , & kirshner ( 1996 ) or the stretch method of perlmutter et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) and goldhaber et  al .",
    "( 2 ) around maximum brightness the @xmath4 color was redder than that of a normal sn  ia , but after about 15 days postmaximum @xmath5 was bluer than normal .",
    "( 3 ) in certain respects ( strong fe  iii , weak si  ii and s  ii ) the premaximum spectra resembled those of the peculiar overluminous sn  1991 t",
    "( filippenko et  al .",
    "1992a ) , but the postmaximum spectral evolution differed from that of both sn  1991 t and normal sne  ia .",
    "fe  iii lines persisted for an unusually long time after maximum brightness while fe  ii lines were late to make their appearance .",
    "l01 discussed the implications of their observations for the physical nature of sn  2000cx and tentatively suggested that it may have been an overluminous event with an even larger yield of @xmath6ni and a higher ejecta kinetic energy than sn  1991 t .",
    "rudy et  al .",
    "( 2002 ; hereafter r02 ) obtained infrared spectra of sn  2000cx , 5 and 6 days before maximum brightness , covering the range 0.8 to 2.5  @xmath7 m .",

    "( 1996 ) and wheeler et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) , who attributed an absorption near 1.05  @xmath7 m in the normal sn  ia 1994d to mg  ii 10296 , r02 identified a 1.02  @xmath7 m absorption in sn  2000cx with the same transition , but forming at unusually high velocity .",
    "they inferred that freshly synthesized magnesium extended to velocities higher than 20,000 , and discussed this finding as support for a delayed detonation explosion model , rather than a deflagration model , for sn  2000cx .",
    "candia et  al .",
    "( 2003 ; hereafter c03 ) presented additional optical and infrared photometry and emphasized that sn  2000cx displayed some characteristics of an _ underluminous _ sn  ia , including a rather fast bolometric light curve . with a recession velocity of only @xmath12200 , ngc  524",
    "is not in the hubble flow , and various ways of estimating its distance span a wide range , so c03 were not able to decide whether sn  2000cx actually was overluminous or underluminous .    in thomas",
    "et  al . ( 2003 ; hereafter t03 ) we concentrated on exploring simple explanations for high  velocity ( @xmath8 ) absorption features produced by the ca  ii infrared triplet .",
    "our favored solution was a high  velocity non  spherical structure ( hereafter a  clump \" ) that only partly covered the photosphere .",
    "we also noted that h@xmath2 might be present in absorption at the same high velocity .",
    "some of the line identifications in the articles cited above were tentative , and many of the spectral features were not identified at all .",
    "here we use the parameterized supernova synthetic  spectrum code * synow * to study line identifications in the photospheric  phase spectra of sn  2000cx .",
    "we also try to shed some light on the causes of the peculiar @xmath0 light curve and @xmath5 color curve .",
    "the spectra we have studied are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the optical spectra , from l01 , range from their earliest spectrum , obtained 3 days before the time of maximum brightness in the @xmath0 band , to 32 days after maximum , when the spectrum was beginning to make the transition from the photospheric to the nebular phase .",
    "the infrared spectrum is the sum of the two spectra obtained by r02 , 5 and 6 days before maximum ; hereafter we will refer to this as the day  @xmath9 spectrum .",
    "a few of the familiar sn  ia absorption features in the optical , produced by si  ii , s  ii , and ca  ii , are labelled . in figure  1 the logarithm of the wavelength is plotted , to allow a fair comparison of the widths of the spectral features at different wavelengths . in subsequent figures the more traditional practice of plotting wavelength is followed .",
    "as figure  1 shows , the spectra did not change very much between days @xmath10 and 7 , although there are some significant differences that we will examine below .",
    "the changes between days  7 and 15 , and especially between days 15 and 32 , are much more obvious .    in a recent article ( branch et  al .",
    "2003 ; hereafter b03 ) we used * synow * to carry out a direct analysis of early spectra of the normal sn  ia 1998aq .",
    "instead of repeating the discussion of the code and the input parameters , we refer the reader to b03 . in ",
    "3 we present a detailed discussion of the day  2 spectrum of sn  2000cx . in ",
    "4 we more briefly discuss the day  7 , 15 , and 32 spectra . in  5 we examine the premaximum spectra , beginning with the day  @xmath10 spectrum .",
    "when analyzing the optical spectra we restrict our attention to wavelengths shorter than 7000 , since the longer wavelength region containing the ca  ii infrared triplet was discussed by t03 .",
    "the day  @xmath9 infrared spectrum also is considered in  5 .",
    "the results are discussed in  6 .",
    "the day  2 spectrum of sn  2000cx is shown in figure  2 with its absorption features labelled by wavelength .",
    "the same spectrum is compared with a day  2 spectrum of sn  1998aq in figure  3 .",
    "ions used by b03 to fit the absorption features in sn  1998aq are indicated . by the standards of sne  ia near maximum light , the differences between these two spectra are large . in sn  2000cx ,",
    "the absorptions that the two events have in common are more blueshifted , and the prominent si  ii and s  ii absorptions are weaker .",
    "sn  2000cx has distinct absorptions at 3900 and 4530  that are missing or weaker in sn  1998aq , while sn  1998aq has an absorption at 4420 , attributed by b03 to si  iii , that is missing or weaker in sn  2000cx .",
    "clearly the main reason that the @xmath5 color of sn  2000cx was redder than that of sn  19998aq at this epoch is that from 3900 to 4300  the spectrum of sn  2000cx is strongly depressed compared to that of sn  1998aq .",
    "the weaker s  ii absorptions of sn  2000cx also contribute to making its @xmath5 redder .",
    "[ it should be mentioned that although sn  1998aq had normal sn  ia spectral features , its @xmath5 color was somewhat bluer than average ( boffi & riess 2003 ; a.  g.  riess et  al .",
    ", in preparation ) ] .",
    "we used * synow * to calculate numerous synthetic spectra for comparison with the day  2 spectrum , considering all ions that can be regarded as plausible according to the supernova spectrum atlas of hatano et  al .",
    "( 1999b ) .",
    "the fitting process was unusually lengthy because it proved necessary to consider line formation at both photospheric velocities ( pv , @xmath110,000 ) and at high velocity ( hv , @xmath120,000 ) . rather than using excitation temperatures as fitting parameters we used the ion ",
    "specific default values ( see b03 ) for pv line formation and a nominal value of 5000  k for hv line formation .",
    "we began with @xmath11  as the default optical  depth e  folding velocity , but ( as reported in the tables ) in some instances we used larger values of @xmath12 to improve the fits .",
    "figure  4 shows a comparison of the day  2 spectrum with a synthetic spectrum that has = 11,000 , @xmath13  k , and contains lines of nine ions : mg  ii , si  ii , s  ii , fe  iii , co  ii , and ni  ii have only pv components ; ca  ii has both pv and hv components ; ti  ii and fe  ii have only hv components .",
    "the ion  specific input parameters  the wavelength and maximum optical depth of the reference line , the minimum , maximum , and optical  depth e  folding velocities , and the excitation temperature  are listed in table  1 . except for ca  ii",
    "the pv ions are mildly detached from the photosphere , at 13,000 .",
    "( detached refers to non ",
    "zero line optical depths beginning not at the photospheric velocity but at a higher detachment velocity . by mildly detached we mean that the difference between the two velocities is rather small . )",
    "when these ions are undetached at 11,000 their absorptions are not blueshifted enough . when @xmath14 is increased from 11,000 to 13,000 , so that these ions become undetached at 13,000 ,",
    "the red edge of the ca  ii h&k absorption is too blueshifted and most of the features are slightly too broad .",
    "it is not clear , however , that the small difference between the adopted photospheric velocity of 11,000  and a detachment velocity of 13,000  is physically significant ; it may simply reflect the limitations of * synow * ( e.g. , the sharp photosphere assumption ) .",
    "the overall fit in figure  4 is fairly good , but there are several obvious discrepancies . as usual with sne  ia , the observed spectrum is more strongly peaked in the middle of the optical spectrum than a blackbody spectrum .",
    "we use a blackbody continuum temperature @xmath15 that works well for the middle of the spectrum because that is where the most interesting line identification issues ( hv ti  ii , h@xmath2 ; see below ) turn out to be .",
    "therefore the red end of the synthetic spectrum , beginning near 5300 , is too high .",
    "obtaining a good fit to the shape of the overall energy distribution is a task for more detailed spectrum calculations , such as those of lentz et  al .",
    "the synthetic spectrum has a peak at 3950  that is too high , and it does not fit well at wavelengths shorter than 3600 ; the fit could be improved by introducing more iron ",
    "peak ions , but with more adjustable parameters .",
    "the most interesting discrepancy is the lack of a synthetic counterpart to the 4530  absorption .",
    "we will return to this below .",
    "figure  5 is like figure  4 but with only the pv components in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the long  wavelength half of the synthetic spectrum is dominated by pv features of si  ii , s  ii , and fe  iii , but at shorter wavelengths the pv  only fit is incomplete . to achieve the fit of figure  4 , pv ni  ii is needed for the 3900  absorption ( one of the absorptions that is not seen distinctly in sn  1998aq ; figure  3 ) and pv co  ii is needed for the 4000  absorption , but as figure  5 shows , this part of the spectrum is not well fit with pv components alone . in figure  5",
    "there also is a serious lack of synthetic absorption to the right of what appears to be a sharp emission peak in the observed spectrum at 4060 .",
    "l01 called attention to this apparent emission feature and noted that it had not previously been observed in sne  ia .",
    "figure  6 is like figure  4 but with only the hv components in the synthetic spectrum .",
    "the hv fe  ii lines play a relatively minor role and their identification is not definite , but remarkably , hv ti  ii lines are important .",
    "these are the same ti  ii lines that , forming at lower velocities , produce the blue trough in peculiar underluminous sn  1991bg  like sne  ia ( filippenko et  al .",
    "1992b ) , in sne ib ( branch et  al . 2002 ) , and in sne  ic ( millard et  al .",
    "the difference between the signatures of pv ti  ii , as seen in sn  1991bg  like sne  ia , and hv ti  ii , as seen in sn  2000cx , is shown in figure  7 .",
    "note that in both cases ti",
    "ii features appear near the middle of the @xmath0 band .",
    "the hv ti  ii lines of sn  2000cx produce both a sudden depression of the spectrum beginning at wavelengths shorter than 4290  and a flux peak at 4060 .",
    "the previously unidentified 4060  peak turns out to be part of the signature of blended hv ti  ii resonance",
    " scattering features .",
    "( the identification of hv ti  ii in sn  2000cx is a good example of the utility of * synow*. it is unlikely that hv ti  ii could have been recognized by looking at line lists or by performing detailed spectrum calculations for existing hydrodynamical models . )",
    "the hv ti  ii features of sn  2000cx are partly responsible for the depression of the spectrum from 3900 to 4300 , therefore they alter the @xmath0 magnitude and the @xmath5 color relative to normal sne  ia , which do not have significant ti  ii features .",
    "the synthetic spectrum of figure  4 does not account for the 4530absorption .",
    "we have not been able to find a plausible pv ion to account for this absorption .",
    "a transition blueshifted by about 13,000  would need to have a rest wavelength near 4720   .",
    "the best fit we could achieve with pv matter , without seriously degrading the fit elsewhere , would be with undetached he  ii 4686 , but this identification is unlikely because even with nonthermal excitation by radioactivity the appearance of he  ii lines is unexpected , and we would need to invoke he  ii forming at a lower velocity than all other pv ions except ca  ii . when he  ii is detached to 13,000 , like the other pv ions ,",
    "its absorption is too blue to fit the 4530absorption .",
    "the strongest optical line of c  iii , 4647 , is too blue even when it is undetached at 11,000 .",
    "c  ii 4745 detached at 15,000  could fit the 4530  absorption , but then c  ii 6580 would produce a strong feature near 6250  that is not observed .    if the 4530  absorption is not produced by pv matter then perhaps it is produced by hv matter .",
    "a transition blueshifted by about 22,000  would need to have a rest wavelength near 4860   .",
    "the only plausible hv candidate that we can suggest is h@xmath2 , at 4861 .",
    "figure  8 shows the effect of including hydrogen lines detached at 22,000 , with an optical depth of the reference line , h@xmath3 , of 5 . with these parameters h@xmath2 accounts for the 4530absorption , while h@xmath3 falls within the 6110  absorption . at first glance",
    "the excessive depth of the synthetic h@xmath3 absorption appears to contradict the h@xmath2 identification , but as discussed in t03 , this is not necessarily the case .",
    "if hv hydrogen is in a clump that covers only a fraction of the photosphere , as inferred by t03 for the hv ca  ii absorption , rather than covering all of the photosphere as assumed in a 1-d * synow * calculation , then the fractional depth of the h@xmath3 absorption is limited by the photospheric covering fraction .",
    "this can be seen in figure  13 of t03 , where h@xmath2 and h@xmath3 are simultaneously fit reasonably well by a model in which hydrogen is confined to a hv clump with a low photospheric covering fraction .",
    "since we have not found a plausible alternative to h@xmath2 , forming at _ any _ velocity between 13,000 and 22,000 , in the remainder of this article we will use h@xmath2 to account for the 4530absorption .",
    "we will return to the issue of h@xmath3 , and consider the paschen lines , in  5.1 and  5.2 .",
    "in this section we more briefly discuss the day  7 , day  15 , and day  32 spectra . at each epoch",
    "we compare the spectrum of sn  2000cx with ( 1 ) a spectrum of sn  1998aq ; ( 2 ) an earlier  epoch spectrum of sn  2000cx ; and ( 3 ) a synthetic spectrum .",
    "the day  7 spectrum of sn  2000cx is compared with a day  7 spectrum of sn  1998aq in figure  9 .",
    "the differences remain substantial and generally similar to those of day  2 . again the suppression of the blue part of the spectrum and the weaker s  ii lines cause the @xmath5 color of sn  2000cx to be redder than that of sn  1998aq .",
    "the day  7 and day  2 spectra of sn  2000cx are compared in figure  10 .",
    "the wavelengths of the absorptions are very similar .",
    "the most significant difference is that the day  7 spectrum has developed more prominent peaks near 4450 and 5170 , with the latter apparently partly filling in the 5270  absorption .",
    "figure  11 shows a comparison of the day  7 spectrum with a synthetic spectrum that has = 11,000 , @xmath16  k , and contains lines of the same ten ions as in figure  8 ( including h  i ) .",
    "the ion  specific input parameters are listed in table  2 .",
    "again all pv ions except ca  ii are mildly detached at 13,000 . comparing tables  1 and 2",
    ", we see that the reference  line optical depths have changed only mildly .",
    "the increase in the fe  iii optical depth and the decrease in the s  ii optical depth are responsible for getting reasonable fits to the 4450 and 5170  peaks . at day  7 the synthetic spectrum in",

    "the day  15 spectrum of sn  2000cx is compared with a day  18 spectrum of sn  1998aq in figure  12 . except at the red end ,",
    "the spectra still are very different .",
    "in fact , at wavelengths shorter than about 4600the spectra are practically opposite : sn  2000cx has absorptions where sn  1998aq has peaks .",
    "the spectra differ so much in the @xmath0 and @xmath17 bands that any close similarity of their @xmath5 colors would be accidental .",
    "the day  15 and day  7 spectra of sn  2000cx are compared in figure  13 . at day  15",
    "the 6110  absorption has hardly changed , but a broad absorption has developed at 5670  and the s  ii absorptions no longer can be seen .",
    "the 4530  absorption is still present , now to the left of an emission peak that has emerged at 4580 .",
    "figure  14 shows a comparison of the day  15 spectrum with a synthetic spectrum that has = 10,000 , @xmath18  k , and contains lines of seven ions : na  i , si  ii , fe  ii , fe  iii , and co  ii have pv components ; h  i and ti  ii are at hv . at this epoch mg  ii ,",

    "the spectrum at wavelengths shorter than 5000  also is well fit .",
    "this has been accomplished by retaining the fe  iii lines and by introducing fe  ii lines having a significant optical depth throughout the whole velocity interval of 11,000 to 23,000  ( by using a high e  folding velocity of @xmath20 ) .",
    "the development of the fe  ii features causes the emergence of the 4580  peak .",
    "the large differences between the spectra of sne  2000cx and 1998aq at this epoch are due to the persistent fe  iii features and to fe  ii features forming throughout the wide velocity interval",
    ".      the day  32 spectrum of sn  2000cx is compared with a day  32 spectrum of sn  1998aq in figure  15 . at this epoch",
    "the spectra generally contain the same features , but those in the blue remain more blueshifted in sn  2000cx .",

    "it is clear from figure  15 that in addition to whatever peculiarity there may be in the underlying continuum ( or pseudo  continuum ) , the higher blueshifts of the features in sn  2000cx play a role in altering the @xmath5 color at day  32 .",

    "this line shape , with its steep blue edge and nearly horizontal part extending from about 6100  to 6300 , has been thought to be odd .",

    "the resemblance of this feature in sn  2000cx to the same feature in sne  1991 t and 1997br , in which no conspicuous `` h@xmath2 ''",
    "features are seen , suggests that there is little room for an h@xmath3 contribution to the spectrum of sn  2000cx at this epoch . but as discussed in t03 , if h@xmath3 is confined to a clump in front of the photosphere and its source function is higher than that of resonance scattering as it ordinarily is in sne  ii , it may be hard to see .",

    "the pv mg  ii features in the synthetic spectrum may have counterparts in the observed spectrum but the synthetic features are too strong , possibly due to the mismatch of epochs if the mg  ii optical depth is increasing with time .",
    "the most important point is that the 1.02  @xmath7 m absorption can not be due to mg  ii 10926 forming above 20,000 , as assumed in r02 , because mg  ii 9226 blueshifted by 20,000  would produce a strong absorption at 8600 , near a peak in the observed spectrum . in lte mg  ii 9226 has a higher optical depth than mg  ii 10926 for any reasonable excitation temperature .",

    "is so weak that it provides no evidence for or against the presence of h@xmath2 in sn  2000cx .",
    "when extended to longer wavelengths the synthetic spectrum for day  @xmath10 does contain a weak blueshifted hydrogen p@xmath3 absorption component that is not seen in the observed spectrum , but p@xmath3 , like h@xmath3 , may have an elevated source function with respect to resonance scattering , and be difficult to see when confined to a clump .",
    "we have found that in the blue the early photospheric  phase spectra of sn  2000cx are composite , containing not only relatively high  excitation features just above the photospheric velocity ( pv ) of @xmath110,000 , but also lower ",
    "excitation features forming at much higher velocity ( hv ) , above @xmath120,000 .",
    "it is clear that the hv features are partly responsible for the photometric peculiarities of sn  2000cx .",
    "for example , hv ti  ii features are present in the @xmath0 band . for the day  @xmath10 , 2 , 7 , 15 , and 32 synthetic spectra",
    "we have used ti  ii reference  line optical depths of 0.7 , 0.4 , 0.6 , 0.3 , and 0.0 , respectively , not inconsistent within our fitting freedom with a smoothly decreasing ti  ii optical depth .",
    "other things being equal , the decreasing blocking of blue flux by hv ti  ii lines would cause the @xmath0 band to rise more quickly than normal , and then to decline more slowly than normal .",
    "this is likely to be at least partly responsible for the lopsided @xmath0band light curve . in our present 1-d calculations ,",
    "most of the flux removed by ti  ii absorption features tends to be re  emitted just to the red , still in the @xmath0 band .",
    "but if ti  ii lines form in a clump in front of the photosphere , then the absorbed flux is emitted into all directions and the observer sees strong net absorption . thus quantitatively evaluating the effects of hv line formation on photometry is a task for 3-d calculations .",
    "similarly , the presence of hv ca  ii infrared triplet absorption in the @xmath24 band may be partly responsible for the unusual behavior of the @xmath24band light curve discussed by l01 and c03 .",
    "we can see from figs .  1 , 15 , and 17 that hv ca",
    "ii remains strong even as late as day  32 .",
    "the evolution of the line strengths of clump  confined matter can be complex , reflecting not only the usual sobolev @xmath25 optical  depth decline for homologous expansion , and whatever excitation and ionization changes may occur , but also the evolving fraction of the photosphere that is covered by the clump .",
    "when the photosphere recedes with respect to the homologously expanding matter an increasing fraction of the photosphere may be covered by the clump .    the only plausible identification that we can find for the 4530absorption is hv h@xmath2 .",
    "this identification is tentative , however , because there is no supporting evidence , and the lack of a conspicuous h@xmath3 signature at day  @xmath10 may require fine tuning of the h@xmath3 source function .",
    "the origin of the hv matter in sn  2000cx remains unclear .",
    "if the hv matter consists of unburned carbon and oxygen with solar abundances of heavier elements , then the required hv mass of @xmath26  m@xmath27 could be contained in a hv clump of ejecta ( t03 ) .",
    "but if the hv matter is hydrogen ",
    "rich then it must have come from a nondegenerate companion star ( marietta , burrows , & fryxell 2000 ) , because @xmath28  m@xmath27 of hydrogen could not have been present on the surface of the progenitor white dwarf without burning . from the absence of a narrow circumstellar h@xmath3 feature in early high  resolution spectra ,",
    "lundqvist et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) infer an upper limit to the wind mass  loss rate of the companion of @xmath29 m@xmath27  yr@xmath30 .",
    "the pv spectra of sn  2000cx also are peculiar . after allowing for the now",
    " recognized role of hv ti  ii features in the blue , the case for a spectroscopic relation between the underlying pv spectra of sne  2000cx and 1991 t is perhaps strengthened .",
    "we confirm and extend the findings of l01 that fe  iii lines persisted for an unusually long time after maximum , that line blueshifts were higher than normal , and that fe  ii lines were late to develop .",
    "we find that when fe  ii lines finally did develop during the late photospheric phase , they formed out to higher velocities than in normal sne  ia .",
    "all of this seems consistent with the suggestion by l01 that sn  2000cx was a more powerful version of sn  1991 t , but as emphasized by c03 , a reliable distance to ngc  524 is needed to determine the luminosity of sn  2000cx .",
    "although hv line formation is unusually strong in sn  2000cx , it has become clear that it sometimes occurs in other sne  ia .",
    "hv ca  ii and fe  ii were first recognized in premaximum spectra of sn  1994d ( hatano et  al .",
    "1999a ) ; strong signatures of hv ca  ii have been detected in premaximum flux and polarization spectra of sn  2001el ( wang et  al .",
    "2003 ; kasen et  al .",
    "2003 ) ; hv ca  ii can be seen in premaximum spectra of sne  1999ee ( hamuy et  al .",
    "2002 ; p.  mazzali , in preparation ) ; and hv fe  ii has been invoked to fit both premaximum and postmaximum spectra of sn  1998aq ( b03 ) .",
    "recently gerardy et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) have attributed hv ca  ii in sn  2003du to a dense shell formed by interaction of the high  velocity ejecta with @xmath31 m@xmath27 of hydrogen  rich circumstellar matter . further close scrutiny of sn  ia spectra to look for more subtle signs of hv line formation is needed .",
    "an indication of which ions would be likely to appear at various temperatures , for carbon  oxygen rich and hydrogen rich compositions , can be obtained from figs . 11 and 12 of to3 .",
    "these figures show that ( in lte ) when h , ca  ii , ti  ii , and fe  ii are present , additional possibilities include na  i , fe  i , sr  ii , and ba  ii , depending on the temperature and electron density",

    "if the hv h@xmath2 identification in sn  2000cx is correct , and yet hv h@xmath2 seldom if ever appears in the spectra of other sne  ia , even those that exhibit hv ca  ii features , one reason could be that the outer layers of most donor stars in sn  ia binary progenitor systems are helium ",
