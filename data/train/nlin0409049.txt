    "the initial condition for the hamiltonian transient is assigned by setting all relative displacements to zero and by drawing velocities at random from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the velocities are then rescaled by a suitable factor to fix the desired value of the initial energy @xmath129 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the details ) .",
    "the one - dimensional numerical simulations reveal that the dissipation rate of the energy is dominated by two sequential effects , that characterize the pathway to localization . in the first stage of the energy release process , the relaxation law undergoes a crossover from the exponential @xmath130 $ ] to the power law @xmath131 , where @xmath132 sets the shortest time scale of the system ( see fig .  [",

    "asymptotically , energy reaches a plateau and , correspondingly , the localization parameter @xmath122 also saturates ( see the inset of fig . [",

    "the crossover at @xmath133 is a signature of the hierarchical nature of the early stages of the process . in the harmonic approximation",
    ", if one adds a small dissipation , the frequency @xmath134 of each linear mode acquires an imaginary part @xmath135 , which represents its damping rate .",
    "initially , it is only the fastest mode which determines the energy relaxation rate .",
    "as time goes on , past @xmath136 , it is the full spectrum of decay times of the linear modes that sets the rules of energy relaxation .",
    "actually , it turns out that at this stage , for small nonlinearities , the system behaves approximately as its linear counterpart ( see fig .",
    "[ f : erel ] ) .",
    "in particular , a perturbative calculation to first order in @xmath137 confirms that  @xcite @xmath138 where the density of states @xmath139 is derived from the dispersion relation @xmath140 , with @xmath141 for free  ends boundary conditions , and @xmath142 for fixed  ends boundary conditions ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "the time range after the crossover coincides with the onset of localization .",
    "now the dynamics is significantly affected by the spontaneous appearance of breathers . as the latter exhibit a very weak interaction among themselves and with the boundaries , the energy release undergoes a slowing down , thus freezing the system in a quasi  stationary configuration far from thermal equilibrium .",

    "an exponential is a straight line with slope one .",

    "parameters are @xmath145 and @xmath146 . ]    such residual state is characterized by the presence of one , highly energetic localized object ( possibly accompanied by a few much smaller ones ) , which is mobile and alternates periods of rest and erratic motion , as shown in fig .",

    "but what do we know of the mechanisms leading to spontaneous localization in the presence of dissipation ? as noticed above , there is evidence that it is the modulation instability of short lattice waves that triggers the formation of localized structures .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the emergence of spatial patterns in the early stages of the relaxation is intimately related to how dissipation acts on vibrational modes of different wavelength . in particular ,",
    "if the system is swiftly enough depleted of long  wavelength modes , the instability associated with the band  edge waves may effectively trigger the process of localization .",
    "a key test for the above hypothesis is offered by the nature of the boundary conditions . in the case of free  ends , the modes of small wavenumber indeed disappear very fast , in conjunction with the onset of spontaneous localization .",
    "on the contrary , in the presence of fixed boundaries the former turn out to be as long  lived as the modes with large wavenumbers .",
    "the corresponding numerical evidence is that hardly no localization is observed in this case .",

    "the spectrum of damping rates can be calculated by straight diagonalization of matrix @xmath153 . in fig .  [",
    "f : relspect ] we plot @xmath135 , where @xmath137 is the opposite of the real part of an eigenvalue of @xmath153 and @xmath134 its imaginary part .",
    "this representation of the relaxation spectrum is preferable with respect to the one in terms of wave - numbers , since the vibration frequencies are shifted as a consequence of the damping .",
    "this calculation confirms that the free  ends and fixed",
    " ends systems display considerably different behaviors . in the former case ,",
    "the least damped modes are the short  wavelength ones ( @xmath157 , the band  edge frequency ) , the smallest damping constant being @xmath158 , while the most damped modes are the ones in the vicinity of @xmath159 . on the contrary , for fixed ends ,",
    "the most damped modes are those around the band center ( @xmath160 ) while both short and long  wavelength waves dissipate very weakly ( @xmath161 .    the above analysis helps understanding why spontaneous localization is strongly inhibited if the system is trapped between rigid walls , thus in parallel unveiling the role of modulational instability in the process .",
    "we have also performed similar numerical simulations for the two - dimensional fpu model  ( [ 2dfpu ] ) , with dissipation added at the edges and free  ends boundary conditions . remarkably , the asymptotic scenario changes .",
    "the quasi ",
    "stationary state is now a static collection of tightly  packed localized objects , arranged in a sort of random lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ f:2dplot ] ) .",
    "moreover , it turns out that spontaneous localization in two dimensions is a thermally  activated phenomenon , described by an arrhenius law for the average breather density , where the parameter that controls the strength of thermal fluctuations is the initial energy density @xmath162  @xcite .",
    "the origin of this behaviour is that , in the two - dimensional fpu system , discrete breathers may be excited only above a certain energy threshold  @xcite , as discussed in section  [ modinst2d ] . despite the different nature of the asymptotic state , the onset of localization follows the same path in one and two dimensions  @xcite , well described the hierarchy of relaxation times underlying eq .",

    "we have extended to two dimensions the study of the process which leads to the formation of chaotic breathers .",
    "the physical picture is similar to the one - dimensional case . besides that",
    ", we make the bridge between breathers created by modulational instability of plane waves and the ones formed when extracting energy from the boundaries : similarities and differences are highlighted .",

    "going to many ",
    "modes initial excitations , it has been remarked that instability thresholds depend on relative amplitudes and not only on the total energy  @xcite .",
    "although this makes the study of the problem extremely involved , we believe that a detailed study of some selected group of modes , which play some special role in fpu dynamics , could be interesting . the method discussed in this paper could be adapted to treat this problem . historically , the first study is in the paper by bivins , metropolis and pasta himself  @xcite , where the authors tackle the problem by studying numerically the instabilities of coupled mathieu s equations .",
