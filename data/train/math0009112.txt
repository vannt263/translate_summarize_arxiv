    "however , since the schubert cycles @xmath14 are @xmath15-invariant , they define elements not only of ordinary but of @xmath15-equivariant cohomology of @xmath0 , and our results hold in that case also . in addition , our main arguments apply to the case of kac - moody @xmath6 .",

    "we can consider the * * symmetric schubert numbers @xmath21 which count the number of points in the intersection of three generic translates of schubert cycles .",
    "since this intersection is transverse ( by a standard appeal to kleiman s transversality theorem ) , and is of three complex subvarieties , the points are all counted with sign @xmath22 and therefore the number is nonnegative .",
    "it is a famous open problem to compute this number combinatorially ; the analogous problem for @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a maximal parabolic was solved first by the littlewood - richardson rule ( or see @xcite ) .",
    "recall the bruhat order on @xmath12 ( due to chevalley ) : @xmath26 if @xmath27 . with this",
    "we can state our two lemmata :    [ lem : dctriv ] let @xmath28 be a schubert problem , and @xmath29 a coxeter generator . if @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 , then @xmath33 .",

    "for this reason we christen the symmetry of lemma [ lem : dc ] * * descent - cycling , and call these three problems * * dc - equivalent . extending this relation by transitivity , we get a very powerful notion of equivalence for solving schubert problems ; in particular many schubert problems are dc - equivalent to ones that fall to lemma [ lem : dctriv ] , ones which we call * * dc - trivial .",
    "define a * * grassmannian schubert problem @xmath28 to be one in which @xmath43 each have only one descent , and in the same place , so named because the relevant integral can be performed on a grassmannian ; these schubert problems are well - understood thanks to littlewood - richardson and other positive rules for their computation .",
    "it is worth pointing out that descent - cycling _ can not _ be formulated in the context of grassmannian problems alone ;    1 .   descent - cycling a ( nontrivial ) grassmannian schubert problem always produces a non - grassmannian schubert problem ; 2 .",
    "grassmannian problems from different grassmannians ( the single descent in different places ) can be dc - equivalent .    in section [ sec :",

    "this we believe to be the main point of interest in the paper  that two such simple lemmata suffice to determine so many schubert numbers .",
    "it is our hope that this symmetry might help guide the search for a combinatorial formula for schubert calculus ; a rule generalizing littlewood - richardson ( the case that @xmath44 each have only one descent , and in the same place ) and manifestly invariant under descent - cycling would have very strong evidence for it .",

    "alas , the rule conjectured there is not invariant under descent - cycling . ]    in section [ sec : cohom ] we give the nearly - trivial proofs of the two lemmata , using standard properties of the ( equivariant ) bgg operators .",
    "we do this in terms of `` schubert structure constants '' rather than symmetric schubert numbers , which seems to be more appropriate for equivariant cohomology , and also gives results in the case of @xmath6 a kac - moody group .    in the @xmath45 case",
    ", there is an intuitive geometrical interpretation in terms of `` reconstructing forgotten subspaces '' ; with this we can also say something about finding the actual flags in the intersection in synthetic - geometry terms , which we do in section [ sec : geometry ] .    in section [ sec : monk ]",
    "we prove monk s rule via descent - cycling , to give an example of an interesting schubert problem that falls to these techniques",
    ". it would be interesting to see if other known cases of @xmath46 ( such as the pieri rule @xcite ) are consequences of descent - cycling .",
    "we are thankful to mark haiman and peter magyar for useful comments .",
    "let @xmath47 be the graph whose vertices are schubert problems for @xmath45 , with edges between two schubert problems that are related by cycling a single descent .",
    "then the descent - cycling lemma [ lem : dc ] says that the symmetric schubert number is constant on connected components of this graph .",
    "recall that we define two schubert problems to be dc - equivalent if they are in the same connected component , i.e. , if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of descent - cyclings .",
    "also , we call a schubert problem dc - trivial if it falls to lemma [ lem : dctriv ] , i.e. for some @xmath48 it has three ascents .",
    "we write a vertical bar to point out the descents , and a horizontal bar indicating to where we intend to cycle a descent .    in the first line of figure",
    "[ fig : ex1 ] we descent - cycle our way to a dc - trivial problem ; this shows @xmath49 . in the second we show @xmath50 dc - equivalent to @xmath51 , so @xmath52 , which is in turn",

    "the reader may enjoy studying hands - on the properties of descent - cycling via the descent - cycling java applet at    http://www.math.berkeley.edu/~allenk/java/dcapplet.html    we established the following facts by brute - force computation .",
    "there are 35 schubert problems for @xmath54 , of which 21 are not dc - trivial .",
    "all 21 live in the same connected component of @xmath55 , which is pictured in figure [ fig:3nontriv ] .",
    "let @xmath56 , and @xmath57 be a schubert problem in dimension @xmath58 .",
    "then the symmetric schubert number @xmath59 equals zero if and only if @xmath57 is dc - equivalent to a dc - trivial problem .",
    "otherwise , @xmath57 is dc - equivalent to @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 denotes the identity permutation and @xmath62 the long word ) , and therefore the symmetric schubert number @xmath59 equals one . put another way , there is exactly one non - dc - trivial component of the schubert problem graph for each @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , the two lemmata ( and the trivial calculation @xmath63 ) suffice to completely determine schubert calculus for @xmath45 through @xmath3 .",
    "we know a priori that this connectedness can not continue at @xmath5 , because the nonzero symmetric schubert numbers are sometimes @xmath64 .",
    "( all symmetric schubert numbers in this paper were computed with the maple package @xcite . )",
    "the graph @xmath65 has 8,881,334 vertices , of which all but 2,351,475 are dc - trivial . throwing out the components with dc - trivial vertices",
    "we are left with 145 components comprising 411,582 vertices .",
    "the lion s share of those vertices , 409,023 , are dc - equivalent to the easy case @xmath60 , leaving 2559 cases ( less than @xmath66 ) not succumbing to dc - equivalence / dc - triviality arguments .    of the remaining 144 components ,",
    "only one contains a grassmannian schubert problem , so in some sense the littlewood - richardson rule does nt help much .",
    "( in fact this is the only one with any grassmannian permutations , so a schubert - times - schur rule would nt help much either . )",
    "exactly one of these components has intersection number zero ( despite containing no dc - trivial schubert problems ) ; one element of it is @xmath67 .",
    "there are also 48 components of size one , i.e. schubert problems that admit no descent - cycling whatever ; one example is @xmath68 .",
    "these computations were done in c and took 2.5 minutes on a pentium 300 .",
    "the limiting factor was that they just barely fit in 64 megabytes of ram , putting the @xmath69 case ( which is roughly @xmath70 times bigger ) out of reach without new ideas .",
    "it seems likely that as @xmath58 increases , the fraction of @xmath45 schubert problems having no place with three ascents ( and so falling to lemma [ lem : dctriv ] alone ) goes to 0 .",
    "we did not pursue this .",
    "it was very tempting to believe that a vanishing schubert number could always be `` blamed '' on dc - equivalence to a dc - trivial problem , and it was very sad to find the lone component in @xmath65 that belies this .",
    "mark haiman pointed out a `` stabilization '' map @xmath71 taking @xmath72 ( where @xmath73 means to add 1 to all elements of @xmath18 ) .",
    "( for example , @xmath74 . )",
    "question : can distinct components become connected under this map ( possibly connecting the rogue component in @xmath65 to a dc - trivial problem ) ?",
    "the statements in this section are slightly different from those in the introduction , in that they are phrased in terms of _ structure constants _",
    "@xmath75 , rather than symmetric schubert numbers @xmath76 .",
    "we first remind the reader of the partial relation between these and explain why we switch to the less - symmetric formulation .    in ordinary cohomology of @xmath0 ( @xmath6 finite dimensional )",
    ", we have the poincar - pairing duality relation @xmath77 where @xmath62 is the long element of the weyl group , and @xmath78 is the kronecker delta .",
    "( note that the duality discussed here is in the sense of dual bases , and not poincar duality ! )    one way to see this is to realize the class @xmath79 not by the schubert cycle @xmath80 but the opposite schubert cycle @xmath81 .",
    "since @xmath62 is connected to the identity in @xmath6 , these two cycles define the same element of cohomology .    from this",
    "we derive that if @xmath82 so in ordinary cohomology , one can work instead with these * * schubert structure constants , although our results from the first section are prettier to state symmetrically . however , in @xmath15-equivariant cohomology the dual basis to the schubert basis is _ not _ once again the schubert basis ( essentially because @xmath62 is not connected to the identity _ through @xmath15-invariant maps _ of @xmath0 ) and these two concepts part ways .    in",
    "@xcite a certain positivity result was proven for the equivariant @xmath83 ( which must be carefully stated , insofar as these are polynomials not numbers ) .",
    "this implies a much weaker positivity result for the @xmath76 , and so it seems more interesting to prove results about the structure constants .    also , in the case of @xmath6 an infinite - dimensional kac - moody group , one can not so blithely do integrals on @xmath0 , and the @xmath75 are the only concept that makes sense .",
    "this concludes the advertisement for schubert structure constants over symmetric schubert numbers .",
    "note that the condition we gave in section [ sec : intro ] for a `` schubert problem '' corresponds to @xmath84 , which seems a reasonable thing to ask since cohomology is a graded ring .",
    "but we will not insist on this in what follows because , in equivariant cohomology , the structure constants can be nonzero even if one only has @xmath85 .",
    "( we only imposed this condition before to keep the graph of schubert problems a reasonable size . )",
    "let @xmath86 be a simple reflection , and @xmath87 be the corresponding minimal parabolic .",
    "let @xmath88 be the corresponding projection ( which is @xmath6-equivariant and therefore @xmath15-equivariant ) ; composing pushforward with pullback defines a degree @xmath89 endomorphism @xmath90 on @xmath91 ( first introduced in @xcite and @xcite , stated nonequivariantly , although equivariant k - theory is implicit in @xcite ) .",

    "4 .   if @xmath96 are two reduced expressions for a weyl group element @xmath18 , then @xmath97 , and so we have a well - defined operator @xmath98 .",
    "since the proofs of both lemmata have much in common , we gather them into a single proposition .

    "combining that with the formula for @xmath108 gives the first result .    if @xmath103 , then the rhs is @xmath109 , and two applications of the formula for @xmath108 give the second result .",
    "the conditions on @xmath110 versus @xmath18 in this proposition are backwards from how they were in lemmata [ lem : dctriv ] and [ lem : dc ] ; that s because of the multiplication by @xmath62 in comparing schubert structure constants with symmetric schubert numbers . with this in mind the two lemmata follow .",

    "a schubert class @xmath107 is in the image of the pullback of @xmath153 if and only if @xmath30 .",
    "since this pullback is a ring homomorphism , the product of two pulled - back classes is also in this image , and can not involve any @xmath16 with @xmath93 .",
