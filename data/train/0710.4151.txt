    "modern cosmology incorporates the notion of dark energy ( de ) as an experimental fact that accounts for the physical explanation of the observed accelerated expansion@xcite .",
    "although the nature of the de is not known , one persistent possibility is the 90-years - old cosmological constant ( cc ) term , @xmath0 , in einstein s equations . in recent times , one is tempted to supersede this hypothesis with another , radically different , one : viz . a slowly evolving scalar field @xmath1 ( `` quintessence '' ) whose potential , @xmath2 , could explain the present value of the de and whose equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath3 is only slightly larger than @xmath4 ( hence insuring a negative pressure mimicking the @xmath0 case)@xcite . the advantage to think this way is that the de can then be a dynamical quantity taking different values throughout the history of the universe .",
    "however , this possibility can not explain why the de is entirely due to such an _ ad hoc _ scalar field and why the contributions to the vacuum energy from the other fields ( e.g. the electroweak standard model ones ) must not be considered . in short , it does not seem to be such a wonderful idea to invent the field @xmath1 and simply replace @xmath5 ( the energy density associated to @xmath0 , where @xmath6 is newton s constant ) with @xmath7 .",
    "one has to explain , too , why the various contributions ( including the additional one @xmath8 ! ) must conspire to generate the tiny value of the de density at present  the `` old cc problem''@xcite .",
    "while we can not solve this problem at this stage , the dynamical nature of the de makes allowance for this possibility .",
    "furthermore , since there is no obvious gain in the quintessence idea , we stick to the cc approach , although we extend it to include the possibility of a dynamical ( `` running '' ) @xmath0 term@xcite .",
    "the obvious question now is : where this dynamics could come from ?",
    "one possibility is that it could originate from the fundamental mechanism of inflation@xcite , which presumably took place in the very early universe and could have left some loose end or remnant  kind of `` fossil ''  in our late universe , which we do nt know where to fit in now .",
    "however , what mechanism of inflation could possibly do that ?",
    "there is in principle a class of distinct possibilities , in particular see @xcite , but our very source of inspiration here is the quantum theory of the conformal factor , which was extensively developed in@xcite . for a recent discussion , see e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "more specifically , we start from the idea of `` tempered anomaly - induced inflation '' , which was first proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it leads essentially to a modified form of the original starobinsky model@xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we push forward the possibility that the mechanism that successively caused , stabilized , slowed down ( `` tempered '' ) and extinguished the fast period of inflation in our remote past could have left an indelible imprint in the current universe , namely a very mild ( logarithmically ) running newton s coupling @xmath6 .",
    "we show that , if matter is covariantly conserved , this necessarily implies an effective renormalization group ( rg ) running of the `` cosmological constant '' energy density , @xmath9 , which takes the form of a cubic law of @xmath10 during the matter dominated epoch ( @xmath11 being the scale factor and @xmath12 the cosmological reshift ) .",
    "following@xcite , we construct a formulation of the standard model ( sm ) in curved space - time which possesses dilatation symmetry@xcite , and extend it to local conformal invariance in @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the action of the theory must include conformally invariant kinetic terms and interaction terms .",
    "as for scalars @xmath14 ( e.g. higgs bosons ) we take that their kinetic terms appear in the combination @xmath15 which is well - known to be conformally invariant for @xmath16 ( after using the non - trivial local conformal transformation law for the scalar of curvature @xmath17 ) .",
    "the fermion and gauge boson kinetic terms are also well - known to be conformally invariant . after the standard set of conformization prescriptions have been applied , the only non - invariant terms are the massive ones .",
    "to fully conformize this theory at the classical level , we adhere to the procedure of the cosmon model @xcite , where one replaces these parameters by functions of some new auxiliary scalar field @xmath18 .",
    "this field is a background field , and so within the philosophy of qft in curved space - time@xcite , it is not submitted ( like the metric itself ) to quantization .",
    "for instance , for the scalar and fermion mass terms in the action we replace @xmath19 where @xmath20 is an auxiliary mass , e.g. related to a high energy scale of spontaneous symmetry breaking of dilatation symmetry@xcite .",
    "we expect @xmath20 in the range of the grand unified theories ( gut s ) or higher : @xmath21 , but certainly below the planck scale @xmath22 . moreover , there is the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action for gravity itself , @xmath23 . with the help of the background field @xmath24 , we can conformize it as follows : @xmath25\\ , .",

    "this setting ( kind of conformal unitary gauge@xcite ) can actually be understood in a more dynamical sense within the context of non - linearly realized dilatation symmetry@xcite .",
    "namely , by reparameterizing @xmath27 , the @xmath28-field just shifts under conformal transformations and behaves as the goldstone boson ( dilaton ) of spontaneously broken dilatation symmetry at the high scale @xmath20 . in this context , the setting @xmath26 can be thought of as @xmath24 taking a vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , with @xmath29 because @xmath28 performs small oscillations around it .",
    "the full conformized classical action of the model becomes invariant under the set of simultaneous transformations @xmath30 for any space - time function @xmath31 and for all scalar and fermion quantum fields @xmath14 and @xmath32 , including the background metric and scalar field @xmath24 .    in this context , the generalized form of the vacuum action in renormalizable qft in curved space - time is@xcite : @xmath33 .",
    "here the first term is the conformal eh term ( [ gravity ] ) , whereas the second contains higher derivatives of the metric and can be expressed in the conformally invariant fashion @xmath34 where , @xmath35 are some parameters , @xmath36 is the square of the weyl tensor and @xmath37 is the gauss - bonet topological invariant in @xmath13 .",

    "in particular , @xmath50 is required for stable inflation@xcite .",
    "we provide here the one - loop coefficient associated to the extra term , with the following result : @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the various ( dirac ) fermion and vector boson masses , respectively , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 are their respective multiplicities ( notice that scalars do not contribute in the conformal case , @xmath16 ) .",
    "we remark that both types of terms in ( [ sdw ] ) are positive definite , hence we infer the important result that @xmath56 for all possible quantum matter contributions . disregarding a conformally invariant term@xcite , one arrives at the following solution of eq.([duff ] ) for the anomaly - induced effective action of the combined background fields @xmath57 and @xmath24 : @xmath58\\sigma\\ } -\\frac{3c+2b}{36}\\int d^4x\\sqrt{-{\\bar g}}[{\\bar r } - 6({\\bar \\nabla}\\sigma)^2 - 6({\\bar { \\nabla}}^2 \\sigma)]^2\\nonumber\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the fourth order , self - adjoint , conformal operator acting on scalars .    in the cosmological context , the conformal factor @xmath42 is related to the scale factor through @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the conformal time .",
    "furthermore , to better clarify the impact on the eh sector of the total action ( [ totality ] ) , let us substitute ( [ quantum ] ) in it and rewrite the final result in the following compact form : @xmath62\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\,{\\rm higher\\ derivative\\ terms}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined the dimensionless parameter @xmath63 in order to project the standard eh frame ( in combination with the higher derivative terms ) we set @xmath24 to its vev , @xmath20 , where conformal symmetry is spontaneously broken ; hence , from ( [ reparam ] ) , @xmath64 . in conformal time , the flat flrw metric is conformally flat , so we have @xmath65 and the terms of @xmath66 , eq.([higher ] ) , trivially decouple from the conformal factor dynamics .",
    "the equation of motion for the scale factor can be computed from the functional derivative of ( [ label ] ) , @xmath67 , upon reverting to the cosmic time .",
    "the exact equation for @xmath68 is a rather complicated , non - linear , 4th order differential equation . a numerical , and also an ( approximate ) analytical , solution",
    "is given in @xcite .",
    "the essential analytic result can be encapsulated in the `` tempered anomaly - induced solution '' , which takes the elegant form @xmath69 in which the parameter @xmath70 is seen to play a fundamental role . here",
    "the scale @xmath71 defines the `` driving force '' for the anomaly - induced inflation : @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 are the number of scalars , dirac fermions and vector bosons contributing to the one - loop result .",
    "we can see that , in this context , primordial inflation is fundamentally associated to the planck scale and also to the existence of the @xmath74 coefficient , which emerges as a pure quantum matter effect . in different models of inflation , one finds different energy sources that trigger the inflationary mechanism@xcite .",
    "essential in the structure of the solution ( [ tais ] ) is the fact that for @xmath75 the inflationary process is progressively slowed down ( `` tempered''@xcite ) .",
    "thus , one may judiciously suspect that , starting from general stable inflation conditions ( @xmath50 ) , the early universe should connect gradually with the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) phase . since @xmath76 , we can estimate from ( [ tais ] ) that this will occur roughly after @xmath77 planck times ( @xmath78 sec . ) . for a typical matter content of a gut ( say , for @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 , one can check that @xmath70 is in the range @xmath81 and , hence , the inflationary period should typically stop at around a hundred thousand planck times , at most , i.e. at @xmath82 sec .",
    "this dating of the inflationary epoch lies in the expected range of most inflationary models@xcite",
    ".    equation ( [ label ] ) suggests that the newton coupling @xmath83 evolves with the scale factor since @xmath84 . defining @xmath85",
    ", the dimensionless parameter ( [ ftilde ] ) can be interpreted as the coefficient of the @xmath47-function driving the renormalization group equation ( rge ) for the effective ( `` running '' ) newton s coupling : @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a function of the renormalized coupling @xmath6 at the scale @xmath88 , and @xmath89 is the current value . at the one loop level",
    ", @xmath90 being @xmath91 , it follows that the parameter @xmath92 is infrared - free and hence the inverse one , @xmath93 ( the running newton s coupling ) , is asymptotically free .",
    "this can be seen from the explicit solution of ( [ dimlessn2 ] ) at one - loop level : @xmath94 where we observe that @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "the logarithmic running of the gravitational coupling ( [ ga ] ) is controlled by the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "such slow evolution may appear nowadays as a kind of `` fossil inertia '' , reminiscent of the early inflationary times .",
    "let us note , however , that the potential infrared effects on the value of @xmath70 could not be taken into account in the above calculation .",
    "therefore , we do nt know the precise prediction for @xmath70 at the present time and , in this sense , it can be treated as a phenomenological parameter . requiring that it should not alter significantly the standard picture , we may arguably suspect that it is still a small number .",
    "we will assume that at low energies ( i.e. in the present universe ) it satisfies @xmath97 .",
    "due to the logarithmic character of the law ( [ ga ] ) , the running of the gravitational coupling should be very mild and virtually undetectable .",
    "we remark , however , that even this minute variation should be understood at a global cosmological level , not as a local one .    the conformal anomaly , being a short distance effect associated to inflation in the early universe , should not distort the formal structure of einstein s equations at very large distances .",
    "thus , we expect essentially the same low energy gravitational theory in the present universe . as already mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the full equation of motion is a fourth order , non - linear , differential equation .",
    "when the inflationary phase has stopped , we must recover the flrw universe in the radiation epoch , and therefore the scale factor grows approximately as @xmath98 .",
    "one finds that all higher order terms in the aforementioned equation of motion decay as @xmath99 whereas the standard ones decay as @xmath100@xcite . as a result",
    "the effect of the higher order terms in the present universe is negligible .",
    "moreover , the terms which are proportional to @xmath101 can all be absorbed in @xmath102 according to @xmath103 , i.e. , as in ( [ ga ] ) .",
    "therefore , only a tiny renormalization of the parameter @xmath6 remains in the infrared epoch as a function of the scale factor .",
    "does this mean that we can not get any hint of the primordial dynamics of the early universe ?",
    "not necessarily so .",
    "let us consider the possible impact on the cosmological term .    from the above considerations",

    "this result is remarkable and encouraging ; it tells us that , despite the extremely slow logarithmic running of the gravitational coupling with the redshift , the dark energy ( in this case , a running cosmological term ) evolves like an ( approximate ) power law of the redshift .",
    "the cosmological term , therefore , finally reveals as the truly detectable `` fossil '' ( in this case , a `` fossil energy '' ) that emerges from this inflationary - inspired scenario . even if @xmath70 is as small at present as indicated by the high energy computation ( @xmath132 )",

    "this equation is formally identical to the one obtained in @xcite where the running scale @xmath139 was assumed , instead of @xmath140 .",
    "the parameter @xmath141 introduced in these references can be identified here with @xmath142 .",
    "this correspondence allows us to immediately transfer the primordial nucleosynthesis bounds on the parameter @xmath141 , obtained in @xcite for a @xmath6-running model similar to the present one , to the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "this result implies that @xmath70 can not be larger than @xmath143 . in the next section ,",
    "we further explore the interesting connections with previous frameworks .",
    "although we have found that the scale factor ( or equivalently , @xmath140 ) is the original running scale appearing in our framework , it is useful to investigate if there are other relevant running scales , with more physical meaning than @xmath11 , that could be useful to track the evolution of the cosmological parameters . in the previous section ,",
    "we have already mentioned the energy scale defined by the hubble function , @xmath139 .",
    "this scale was originally proposed in @xcite and further exploited in @xcite , see also@xcite .",
    "consider now the periods of the cosmic history more accessible to our observations , i.e. the matter and radiation dominated epochs . in this case",
    ", the approximate formula ( [ rlz ] ) applies to within very good accuracy .",
    "then , from ( [ gfez ] ) , we have @xmath144 where we assume that @xmath12 is sufficiently high such that the cc is subdominant ( recall that @xmath125 ) .",
    "the meaning of equation ( [ lnh ] ) is that , in virtually all our observable past , the running of @xmath6 in terms of the scale factor can be traced by a useful physical observable : the expansion rate @xmath145 . in this way , the effective coupling @xmath93 in ( [ ga ] ) can approximately be rewritten as a running function of @xmath145 : @xmath146 this result is encouraging because it nicely fits with the previous result obtained in the alternative framework of @xcite , that is , provided we use ( again ) the correspondence @xmath147 between the basic parameters of the two frameworks . at the same time",
    ", we have the running of the cc term as a function of the expansion rate : @xmath148 as it is patent from this equation , the running of the cc term can be traced by @xmath145 during the entire matter and radiation dominated epoch up to the present day .",
    "this includes , in particular , the full range of the supernovae observations .    from the foregoing",
    ", we see that @xmath139 acts as an alternative running scale that tracks the evolution of the cosmological parameters @xmath6 and @xmath116 .",
    "although the primary evolution of these parameters is formulated in terms of the scale factor , the latter is not physically measurable .",
    "in contrast , the expansion rate @xmath145 is a physical observable , which we are measuring nowadays with an increasing level of precision . in this sense",
    ", the evolution of the cosmological parameters can be better traced through the evolution of @xmath145 , whenever possible .",
    "furthermore , the use of @xmath145 as a running scale allows the present cosmological model to naturally connect with the previous rg formulations @xcite and , at the same time , to benefit from the various phenomenological opportunities described there to identify the dark energy as a dynamical cosmological term .",
    "thus , an advantage of the present approach is that it preserves essentially all the nice features of the previous ones while suggesting a potential connection with the primordial physics of the early universe .",
    "it is in this sense that the de that we have detected in our old universe could be viewed as a `` fossil '' of the very early times ; in fact a `` quantum fossil '' because the non - zero value of the coefficient @xmath70 is related to the quantum effects of matter particles , see eq.([ftilde ] ) .",
    "let us note that the trading of @xmath11 for @xmath145 ceases to hold when the universe becomes highly dominated by the cc since , then , the universe is essentially in the de sitter phase , which means that @xmath145 becomes constant even though the scale factor starts to grow exponentially .",
    "clearly , in such circumstances @xmath145 is not a good tracer of @xmath11 .",
    "therefore , in the future , when the control of the evolution is overtaken by an approximately constant cosmological term @xmath149 , the expansion rate takes the value @xmath150 .",
    "while this regime persists , we have @xmath151 and the original running law ( [ ga ] ) can not be mimicked as in ( [ galnh ] ) , but as follows : @xmath152 during the quasi - de sitter regime , the physical scale parameter tracking the running of @xmath6 is the cosmic time ; equivalently , the energy scale is @xmath153 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath145 and @xmath116 remain essentially constant whereas @xmath6 increases with @xmath154 as indicated above .",
    "however , this situation will not last forever ; one can show from the full structure of the expansion rate ( [ gfelz ] )  with @xmath118 given by ( [ rla ] )  and from the equation for @xmath155 ( the acceleration ) , that there is a remote future instant of the cosmic where the universe will arrive at a turning point in its evolution .",
    "we shall not dwell here on the details of that remote future epoch , see @xcite .",
    "it suffices to say that the universe somehow will recreate in the distant future the tempered inflation process that it underwent in the past , in the sense that the present and future state of slow inflation will also cease , roughly after @xmath156 hubble times , viz . when the turning point will be approached .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , in this framework , the running of the cosmological term is actually tied to the running of the gravitational coupling .",
    "this can be better seen if we rewrite the bianchi identity ( [ difccg ] ) as follows : @xmath157 where in the second equality we have used friedmann s equation in the flat case ( @xmath6 being here , of course , @xmath158 ) . as we have discussed in section [ sect : runningscales ] , use of the expansion rate as the running scale is adequate for most practical purposes at present and , in addition , it enables us to trace the running of the parameters in terms of a direct physical observable .",
    "therefore , let us further transform the rge ( [ bianchi2 ] ) in terms of the more physical running scale @xmath145 through the relation ( [ lnh ] ) .",
    "the latter leads to @xmath159 . using the one - loop result for the rge of @xmath160 , eq.([dimlessn2])-([g1loop ] )",
    ", we may express the desired differential running law for @xmath116 as follows : @xmath161 this equation can be thought of as the rge for the cc density and has exactly the required form that we suggested on different grounds in previous approaches to the rg evolution of the cosmological term ( see e.g. @xcite ) . as a result",
    ", we obtain a possible unified description of the early and late history of the universe in rg terms .",
    "moreover , the physical interpretation of @xmath141 in the present framework is physically the same as in the previous approach , except that here we have found a possible connection of this parameter with the mechanism of primeval inflation . indeed , with the help of ( [ ftilde ] ) , we can rewrite @xmath141 in ( [ rgelambdaf ] ) as follows : @xmath162 with @xmath163 here @xmath164 are the masses of all the matter particles contributing in the loops .",
    "equations ( [ nu ] ) and ( [ m2 ] ) adopt the general form that we postulated for the rge of the cosmological term in @xcite .",
    "we see , remarkably enough , that the heaviest particles provide the leading contribution to the running of @xmath116 .",
    "this feature is what we called `` soft - decoupling '' in these references , in the sense that the cosmological term evolution satisfies , in contrast to the other parameters in qft , a renormalization group equation that is driven in part by the heaviest masses @xmath164 and in part by the physical running scale @xmath139 .",
    "the running law for the cc density , thus , follows a sort of generalization of the decoupling theorem@xcite .",
    "this is related to the fact that @xmath116 is a dimension-4 parameter . since there appears no contribution on the _ r.h.s .",

    "is of the order @xmath168 . recalling that @xmath169 , we find that the value of @xmath168 falls just in the ballpark of the current value of the cc density , @xmath170 .",
    "the running of @xmath116 through ( [ rgelambdaf ] ) is , therefore , smooth and of the correct order of magnitude . to be precise , that rge tells us that the typical variation of @xmath116 as a function of @xmath145 is , at any given time in the cosmic history , of the order of @xmath116 itself .",
    "let us note that the masses @xmath164 could be substantially smaller than @xmath171 and still get a sizeable effect in the running of the cc .",
    "for example , assume that there is physics just at a gut scale @xmath172 a few orders of magnitude below the planck scale .",
    "this would indeed be the case if we assume that there is a large multiplicity in the number of particles involved in that gut scale .",

    ", we have found that the soft decoupling terms @xmath166 are the leading ones determining the running of @xmath116 .",
    "we obtain no @xmath165 contributions at all .",
    "the solution of ( [ rgelambdaf ] ) that satisfies the boundary condition @xmath177 is just eq.([rlzmde2 ] ) , as expected .",
    "we emphasize that the previous interpretation is based on assuming that the computation of @xmath70 in section [ sect : conformal ] can be applied to the present time .",
    "as we already warned , there might be infrared effects that could distort this picture , but we have assumed that @xmath70 will remain small and maybe not essentially different from what we have found .",

    "_ of ( [ dimlessn2 ] ) and ( [ rgelambdaf ] ) , namely corrections of the form @xmath178 ( @xmath179 ) .",
    "however , if the scale @xmath139 ( defining the typical cosmic energy of the flrw models ) is used for a physical description of the running of the cosmological parameters , these corrections should be negligible since @xmath180 for any known and conceivable particle@xcite .",
    "in this work we have suggested that the presence of dynamical dark energy ( de ) in the current universe is actually a consistency demand of einstein equations under the two assumptions of : i ) matter conservation , and ii ) the existence of a period of primordial inflation in the early universe , especially when realized as `` tempered anomaly - induced inflation '' .",
    "based essentially on the previous works@xcite and on the general setting of the quantum theory of the conformal factor@xcite , we have found that if the inflationary mechanism is caused by quantum effects on the effective action of conformal quantum field theory in curved space - time , then the gravitational coupling @xmath6 becomes a running quantity of the scale factor , @xmath181 , @xmath70 being the coefficient of the @xmath47-function for the conformal newton s coupling .",
    "the effect of this coupling on the inflationary dynamics is to efficiently `` temper '' the regime of stable inflation presumably into the flrw regime .",
    "the rigorous high energy calculation of @xmath70 in qft in curved space - time shows that both fermions and bosons produce non - negative contributions ( @xmath182 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath6 becomes an asymptotically - free coupling of the scale factor .",
    "intriguingly enough , we have suggested the possibility that this running might persist in the present universe and , if so , it could provide a _",
    "raison dtre _ for the existence of the ( dynamical ) de , which would appear in the form of running cosmological vacuum energy @xmath116 .",
    "in fact , the logarithmic evolution of @xmath6 induces a power - law running of @xmath116 , which is essentially driven by the soft - decoupling terms @xmath166 ( hence by the heaviest particle masses ) .",
    "the result is a universe effectively filled with a mildly - dynamical de , which can be perfectly consistent with the present observations .",
    "to summarize , from the point of view of the `` rg - cosmology '' under consideration , the current universe appears as flrw - like while still carrying some slight imprints of important physical processes that determined the early stages of the cosmic evolution .",
    "most conspicuously , the smooth dynamics of @xmath6 and @xmath116 can be thought of as `` living fossils '' left out of the quantum field theoretical mechanism that triggered primordial inflation .",
    "remarkably , this framework fits with previous attempts to describe the renormalization group running of the cosmological term@xcite and could provide an attractive link between all stages of the cosmic evolution .",
    "it is reassuring to find that there is a large class of rg models behaving effectively the same way .",
    "differences between them could probably be resolved at the level of finer tests , such as those based on cosmological perturbations and structure formation .",
    "for example , in references@xcite it is shown that the study of cosmological perturbations within models of running cosmological constant puts a limit on the amount of running , which is more or less stringent depending on the peculiarities of the model .",
    "similarly , a particular study of perturbations would be required in the present framework ( which includes the variation of both @xmath183 and @xmath6 ) to assess the implications on the parameter @xmath70 .",
    "this study is beyond the scope of the present work .    _",
