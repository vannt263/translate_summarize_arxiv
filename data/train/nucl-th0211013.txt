    "weak interactions in nucleon matter occur during the beta - decay of nuclei , electron and muon capture reactions , neutrino - nucleus scattering and in various astrophysical environments , such as evolving stars , neutron stars and supernovae .",
    "they have been studied since fermi proposed the first theory of beta - decay in 1934 .",
    "recently there has been much interest in weak interactions in the sun @xcite , those of @xmath2c and @xmath3o due to their use in neutrino detectors searching for neutrino oscillations @xcite , and in interactions of neutrinos with dense matter in neutron stars and supernovae @xcite .",

    "the fermi coupling constant multiplying these operators is omitted for brevity , @xmath6 is the electroweak mixing angle , and @xmath7 is the ratio of the weak axial vector and fermi coupling constants of the nucleon .",
    "the four operators are called fermi ( f ) , gamow - teller ( gt ) , neutral - vector ( nv ) and neutral - axial - vector ( na ) . in the nonrelativistic domain , neglecting weak pair currents , the interaction of low energy neutrinos with nuclei and nucleon matter and nuclear beta - decay rates are proportional to the square of the matrix elements of these operators between initial and final nuclear states .    due to the strong forces , nuclear wave functions",
    "are highly correlated @xcite , and it is difficult to calculate the nuclear matrix elements . using quantum monte carlo and faddeev methods to calculate nuclear wave functions from realistic models of nuclear forces ,",
    "the beta - decay matrix elements have been calculated for light nuclei with @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the calculated values for @xmath9h , @xmath10li and @xmath11be are within 5 % of the observed , and better agreement is obtained after including weak pair currents .",
    "the weak muon capture by @xmath9he has also been calculated @xcite with realistic wave functions with similar success",
    ".    however , complete many - body calculations are not yet possible for nuclei like @xmath2c and heavier , as well as for nucleon matter .",
    "most studies of weak interactions in these systems use effective interactions and shell - model and fermi - gas wave functions in finite nuclei and nucleon matter respectively . the random phase approximation ( rpa )",
    "is commonly used .",
    "the pioneering work on gt transitions has been reviewed by arima _ et .",
    "al _ @xcite .",
    "some of the recent works are : @xcite in @xmath2c , @xcite in @xmath12-shell , and @xcite in neutron stars and supernovae .",
    "typically the calculated rate of weak interactions is larger than observed ; for example , a factor of @xmath13 0.6 brings the calculated @xmath12-shell gt transition rates in agreement with experiment .",
    "recent lsnd results of charged current reaction cross sections of @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite on @xmath2c are lower than the theoretical expectations by up to 20 % .",
    "this is not surprising since effective operators which take into account the effects of short range correlations , and not the bare operators given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) to ( 4 ) , must be used along with effective interactions as is well known from the works of arima and collaborators @xcite . in nuclei near the line of stability the observed spectra and beta - decay rates",
    "have been used to model the effective interactions and operators , but for neutron stars and supernovae matter we have to calculate them from realistic models of nuclear forces . in @xmath12-shell and",
    "heavier nuclei the effective interaction is also obtained from bare forces @xcite .",
    "there are several ways to obtain consistent sets of effective operators and interactions starting from a bare nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "for example , one can introduce a model space and employ the lee - suzuki similarity transformation @xcite as in the no core shell model type approach @xcite .",
    "in this theory the effective operators and interactions take into account the truncated hilbert space .",
    "they are used in the retained model space to predict the observables . in the present work we use the correlated basis ( cb ) approach @xcite , evolved out of variational theories of quantum liquids @xcite . in this theory the uncorrelated shell model or fermi - gas states",
    "are transformed by correlation operators to cb states without truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "the effective operators and interactions are matrix elements of the bare quantities in the cb states ; they take into account the effects of short range correlations .",
    "the correlation operators are chosen such that the nuclear interactions are relatively mild in the cb .",
    "observables are calculated using standard many - body perturbation theory methods in cb .",
    "here we focus on weak interactions in nucleon matter . in variational calculations @xcite the nuclear matter wave functions",
    "are approximated with correlated states : [ cbwf ] _ x = ( s _ i <",
    "j f_ij ) _ x  , where @xmath16 are uncorrelated fermi - gas ( fg ) states and @xmath17 are pair correlation operators .",
    "the @xmath18 denotes a symmetrized product necessary because the @xmath17 and @xmath19 do not commute .",
    "one can also relate uncorrelated shell model states to correlated states in a similar way .",
    "the correlated states obtained from eq .",
    "( [ cbwf ] ) are not orthogonal ; we assume that they are orthonormalized using a combination of lwdin and schmidt transformations @xcite preserving the diagonal matrix elements of the hamiltonian . however , the orthonormalization corrections are of higher order than those considered here .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the orthonormal correlated states .",
    "the effective interactions in cb perturbation theory are defined such that : x|h|y & = & _ x | h_0 + h_i | _ y  , + h_0 & = & _ i - ^2_i  , + h_i & = & _ i < j v^cb_ij + _ i < j < k v^cb_ijk + ...",
    ". here @xmath21 is the nuclear hamiltonian containing realistic two- and possibly three - nucleon interactions .",
    "even when @xmath21 has only two - body interactions the cb @xmath22 can have three- and higher body terms . since the correlated states are expected to be close to the eigenstates of @xmath21 , the non - diagonal matrix elements @xmath23 are small",
    "this implies that the cb effective interactions can be used in perturbation expansions based on the hartree - fock approximation .",
    "however , the 1st order results are often not sufficiently accurate .",
    "the product of pair correlation operators ( eq .",
    "( [ cbwf ] ) ) can not transform the uncorrelated states into the exact eigenstates of @xmath21 .",
    "cb calculations of the optical potential of nucleons in nuclear matter @xcite including up to 2nd order terms in @xmath22 , and of the response of nucleon matter to electromagnetic probes including correlated particle - hole rescattering @xcite , have been relatively successful . in these works ,",
    "as well as here , the three- and higher - body effective interactions are neglected .    in the present work we use the static pair correlation operator : f_ij & = & _ p=1,6 f^p(r_ij)o^p_ij  , + o^p=1,6_ij & = & 1 ,  ,  ,  ,  s_ij ,  s_ij  . in place of the @xmath24 superscripts we often use the letters @xmath25 and @xmath26 to denote the radial functions associated with these operators .",

    "the results of the latest @xcite variational calculations are briefly summarized in section vi for completeness .",
    "the argonne v18 two - nucleon @xcite and urbana ix three - nucleon @xcite interactions are used in these nuclear matter calculations , in studies of weak interactions of light nuclei @xcite , and in the present work .",
    "however , improved models of @xmath28 are now available @xcite .",
    "the variational calculations of nucleon matter also include two spin - orbit terms in the @xmath17 which are omitted here for simplicity .",
    "the variationally optimized @xmath17 can depend upon the proton fraction @xmath29 .",
    "however , this dependence seems to be relatively weak .",
    "the effective interaction obtained from the @xmath17 in symmetric nuclear matter gives a fair description of the spin susceptibility of pure neutron matter .",
    "matrix elements of operators between cb states are generally calculated using cluster expansions @xcite .",
    "we begin with the simplest , lowest order two - nucleon cluster approximation to study the general properties of the weak one - body effective operators and of the two - body interactions in cb for nucleon matter at densities @xmath30 0.08 , 0.16 and 0.24 @xmath0 and for proton fraction @xmath31 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 and 0.5 . in this density",
    "range the contributions of clusters with @xmath32 nucleons to the energy of symmetric nuclear matter increases from 10 to 30% of that of the 2-body @xcite ; thus the present results have only qualitative significance .",
    "we study the density , proton fraction and momentum dependence of the operators and the interactions .    due to correlations and weak pair currents ,",
    "the effective weak current operators have 2- and many - body terms in addition to the leading one - body term we consider here . the lowest order ( in cluster expansion )",
    "effective one - body f , gt and neutral current operators are calculated and their results are presented in sections ii to v. as expected the one - body cb matrix elements are smaller in magnitude than those in fg states .",
    "the dominant term responsible for the quenching arises from pion exchange interactions which change the isospins and spins of the nucleons . in the fg wave function ,",
    "a nucleon in the single particle state @xmath33 , for example , is a spin @xmath34 neutron with unit probability .",
    "this probability is reduced in the cb state by the spin - isospin correlation operators acting on the fg state .",
    "in contrast , the spin - isospin independent spatial correlations induced by the repulsive core in the two - nucleon interaction increase the magnitude of f , gt and na matrix elements ; however , they quench the neutron nv . the cb matrix elements of the charge current operators",
    "are found to have a rather small dependence on the matter density and @xmath29 within the range considered .",
    "they depend primarily on the momentum transfer @xmath35 , and only slightly on the initial or final nucleon momentum .",
    "in addition to these , the neutral current matrix elements also depend upon @xmath29 .",
    "the proton nv matrix element is an exception ; it has large cancellations and depends on all of the relevant variables .",
    "the squares of the f and gt matrix elements in cb states are @xmath13 0.8 and 0.75 times those in fg states at small values of @xmath35 .",
    "thus the present 0th order ( in cb @xmath22 ) 2-body cluster calculation predicts a quenching of low energy weak transitions in nuclei and nucleon matter by @xmath13 20 to 25 % .",
    "it is likely that higher order effects will further reduce the matrix elements and increase the quenching .",
    "for example , the occupation probability of states with momenta @xmath36 is @xmath13 0.9 in cb states , and it decreases to @xmath13 0.8 on including 2nd order @xmath22 corrections @xcite . in order to obtain quantitative results it will be necessary to include contributions of @xmath32-body clusters to the cb matrix elements neglected in this initial study .",
    "this has been done for symmetric nuclear matter @xcite with operator chain summation techniques ; however , they are difficult to use in matter with @xmath37 . three - body cluster contributions in asymmetric matter can now be calculated using the recently developed matrix methods @xcite .",
    "the results for the cb two - nucleon interaction are presented in sect .",
    "it gives a fair description of the spin - isospin susceptibilities of nucleon matter used to determine the effective interactions in the landau - migdal scheme @xcite .",
    "it also has the typical features of the effective interactions used in existing calculations of weak interactions in nucleon matter @xcite .",
    "if we assume that the calculations with effective interactions are implicitly using cb states , then their results should be reduced by a factor of @xmath13 0.75 to take into account the quenching of the f and gt matrix elements by short range correlations .",
    "attempts to calculate the weak interaction rates in nucleon matter with the effective operators and cb interaction presented here are in progress .",
    "let @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the normalized correlated states obtained by operating on the fg states @xmath40 and @xmath41 by the correlation operator @xmath42 .",
    "the cb fermi matrix elements are given by : @xmath43 \\ o_f\\ [ { \\cal s } \\pi f_{ij}]| \\phi_i \\rangle } { \\sqrt{\\langle \\phi_f| [ { \\cal s } \\pi f_{ij}]^2 | \\phi_f \\rangle    \\langle \\phi_i|[{\\cal s } \\pi f_{ij}]^2| \\phi_i \\rangle } } ~ ,   \\label{cbme}\\ ] ] apart from the orthogonality corrections @xcite neglected here .",
    "the corresponding uncorrelated , fg matrix element ( fgme ) is @xmath44 .",
    "it is non - zero only when the occupation numbers of the states @xmath45 and @xmath46 differ by only one nucleon , since @xmath47 is a one - body operator .",
    "in contrast the cb matrix element ( cbme ) can be non - zero even when the occupation numbers of @xmath45 and @xmath46 differ by more than one nucleon .",
    "however , here we consider only the dominant `` one - body '' cbme in which they differ by only one nucleon .",
