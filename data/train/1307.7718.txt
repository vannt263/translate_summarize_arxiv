    "during the past decade the use of entanglement in the study of complex quantum systems has developed at an increasingly fast pace  @xcite .",
    "extended analyses have established the monotonic scaling of the von neumann entropy in the ground state of spin models  @xcite , the so called _ area - law _ , and its profound relations both with conformal field theory ( cft )  @xcite and with the so - called `` majorization '' of the entanglement along renormalization group flows in quantum spin chains  @xcite .",
    "the von neumann entanglement entropy is in general extremely hard to compute and its measurement requires complete state tomography  @xcite . on the other hand , it has been argued that the rnyi entropies of higher order contain substantial information about the universal properties of a quantum many - body system  @xcite . in particular , the rnyi entropy of order @xmath0 is directly related to the purity of the ground - state block reduced density matrix , is significantly easier to compute compared to the von neumann entropy ( i.e. the rnyi entropy of order @xmath1 ) , and can in principle be measured directly  @xcite . moreover , characterizing the behavior of the rnyi block entanglement entropies is equivalent to characterizing the entanglement spectrum , i.e. the entire set of eigenvalues of the ground - state reduced block density matrix  @xcite .    indeed ,",
    "these quantities play a relevant role in determining the scaling properties of numerical algorithms based on matrix product states  @xcite .",
    "the rnyi entropies are also a useful tool to determine the continuous or discontinuous nature of a phase transition  @xcite and to estimate quasi - long - range order in low - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the concept of topological entanglement entropy  @xcite can be extended to the rnyi entropies for which it has been shown to coincide with the total quantum dimension  @xcite .",
    "concerning the relation of the entanglement spectrum to quantum phase transitions , it has been recently shown that a particular subset of such spectrum , that is the difference between the two largest eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix , the so - called schmidt gap , plays the role of an effective order parameter in one - dimensional quantum spin-@xmath1 models endowed with haldane topological phases  @xcite .    above all",
    ", there is a growing awareness that the entanglement properties of quantum ground states provide the most fundamental characterization of quantum phases of matter beyond the traditional approach based on symmetry breaking , especially when considering quantum phases of matter that are established in the absence of symmetry breaking and local order parameters , and are due , e.g. , to the presence of hidden topological order associated to a non - vanishing topological component of the ground - state entanglement entropies  @xcite . in this perspective",
    ", the entanglement spectrum and the topological components of the rnyi entropies are being actively investigated in various problems at the cutting edge of condensed matter physics , including bose - hubbard spin liquids  @xcite , frustrated models on nontrivial lattice geometries  @xcite , non - abelian fractional hall systems  @xcite , and low - dimensional gapless models  @xcite .    when the rnyi entropies are computed for blocks @xmath2 of @xmath3 spins in the ground state of critical models at zero field ,",
    "it is observed that , for order @xmath4 , they are characterized by large sub - leading corrections that violate monotonicity in the size of the block ( @xmath3 ) , while no effect appears in the ising chain at any value of the transverse field  @xcite .",
    "the presence of this oscillatory behavior has been explained thus far as a peculiar characteristics of critical models , due to parity effects , i.e. depending on whether the number of spins in a given partition is even or odd .    in the present work",
    "we show that the oscillatory scaling is a universal feature of the entanglement spectra and of the rnyi entropies in the ground state of critical and noncritical one - dimensional models and that this behavior is related to the existence of a factorizing field , located always below or coinciding with the critical field  @xcite , at which the system hamiltonian admits at least one fully separable ground state . using exact analytical methods for integrable models and numerical methods for non - integrable ones ,",
    "we show that all one - dimensional models admitting ground - state factorization exhibit two different scaling regimes , separated by the factorizing field @xmath5 . in the region @xmath6 the schmidt gap and the rnyi block entropies exhibit a non monotonic scaling in the size @xmath3 of the block , while monotonicity is restored for @xmath7 .",
    "these oscillations are associated to a series of crossovers between the two entangled eigenvectors of the reduced block density matrix associated to the two largest eigenvalues . increasing the size of the block the schmidt gap closes exponentially in the symmetry broken phase but with a ratio that increases as @xmath8 decrease for @xmath9 . on the contrary",
    ", it becomes independent of @xmath8 as soon as @xmath10 .",
    "we will relate this general scaling structure in one dimension to a finite - range , entanglement - driven order that is captured by introducing a global order parameter of entanglement .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the class of @xmath11 and @xmath12 models in transverse field and discuss , using exact analytic methods , the scaling of the rnyi block entropies in the ground state of such models , either gapped or gapless , in the thermodynamics limit . in all cases",
    ", we show that the factorizing field @xmath5 separates two different scaling regimes in the behavior of the rnyi block entropies , either as functions of the transverse field @xmath8 or of the size of the block @xmath3 . in section",
    "iii we analyze the behavior of the entanglement spectrum as a function of @xmath3 and we show how the oscillatory behavior is associated to crossovers between the eigenvectors of the block reduced density matrix corresponding to the two largest eigenvalues . as a consequence ,",
    "we show how the schmidt gap , i.e. the difference between the two largest eigenvalues , captures most of the significant aspects of the behavior of the full entanglement spectrum . in section",
    "iv we analyze the detailed features of the oscillatory scaling , showing that it is characterized by a set of frequencies that depend only on the normalized transverse field @xmath13 . as a consequence , a series of ordered entangled structures in terms of quasi - dimers , quasi - trimers , and quasi - polymers is identified for all fields below the factorization point .",
    "this form of quantum order is characterized by a global parameter of entanglement defined as the integral , over all block lengths , of the rnyi entropy of infinite order . in section",
    "v we extend our investigation to non - integrable models of the @xmath14 class . at variance with the @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and ising classes ,",
    "non - integrable models may not always admit ground - state factorization points . using numerical methods , in particular the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) algorithm on systems of large but finite size ( up to @xmath15 spins ) ,",
    "we discuss analogies and differences between the scaling of the entanglement spectrum in models that admit and models that do not admit factorized ground states .",

    "when @xmath8 takes the value @xmath23 the system admits two degenerate , fully factorized ground states that are products of single - site states  @xcite . for anisotropy @xmath24 such local states",
    "are not , in general , eigenstates of @xmath25 .",
    "hence , their tensor product is not an eigenstate of the parity operator along @xmath26 . on the contrary , their coherent linear symmetric superpositions ( with positive or negative relative sign )",
    "define two degenerate ground states of definite parity ( respectively even or odd ) whose entanglement , in general , does not vanish . for @xmath27",
    "the two factorized ground states collapse into a single state that preserve all the symmetries of the hamiltonian . in the thermodynamic limit , regardless of the value of @xmath21 , at @xmath28 the system undergoes a quantum phase transition in the @xmath11-plane . for @xmath29 and @xmath30",
    "the system is characterized by a two - fold degenerate ground space and a gapped energy spectrum with a magnetic order along the @xmath31 axis , while for @xmath32 and @xmath30 the ground state is unique and the energy spectrum is gapless .",
    "the presence of possible degeneracies in the ground space and the fact that different ground states may be characterized by different entanglement properties require , before proceeding further , that we fix the class of ground states on which the investigation shall be focused .",
    "indeed , in order to capture the possible universal aspects in the scaling behavior of the entanglement spectrum and of the rnyi block entropies , one needs to treat the gapped case @xmath24 consistently with the isotropic case @xmath33 and with the paramagnetic phase @xmath34 , since in these two instances the system hamiltonian admits only a single , non - degenerate ground state that preserves all the symmetries .",
    "therefore , from now on we will consider , also in the magnetically ordered phases of gapped models ( @xmath24 and @xmath35 ) , only the class of ground states that preserve all the symmetries of the hamiltonian , including parity .",
    "that is , we will consider only states of definite fixed parity , either even or odd",
    ". of course , also the case of states with no definite parity is physically very relevant . on the other hand ,",
    "it is technically much more complex , since in such instance one needs to resort to challenging numerical investigations even for the simplest , exactly solvable hamiltonians like the one - dimensional @xmath11 model",
    ". therefore the case of parity non - conserving ground states will be attacked and investigated carefully in a separate work .",
    "models of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 class play a relevant role in the field of quantum statistical mechanics because they are exactly solved by resorting to the jordan - wigner transformations of the spin operators into pseudo - fermion operators  @xcite . indeed , given a bipartition of our one - dimensional lattice of total size @xmath36 into a block of @xmath3 spins and a remainder of size @xmath37 , it is always possible to obtain , for ground states of fixed parity , an exact analytical expression of the reduced block density matrix @xmath38 , i.e. of the block reduced state obtained by tracing the ground state over the degrees of freedom of the remainder .",

    "[ figwithout ] . at variance with models that do admit ground - state factorization",
    ", the area - law scaling with the size of the block , @xmath145 , appears to be _ always _ violated for _ all _ values of @xmath8 , as one can see from fig .",
    "[ figwithout ] .",
    "however , all the rnyi entropies behave smoothly and do not acquire local maxima . on the other hand ,",
    "when considered as functions of the block size @xmath3 ( at fixed external field @xmath8 ) , the block entropies exhibit the same oscillating behavior as in models with factorized ground states .",
    "these features can be intuitively understood by considering that in these models factorization , so to speak , is shifted away towards infinitely large values of @xmath8 , indeed corresponding to a classical saturation .",
    "the latter is the physical limiting situation in which an extremely strong transverse field orients all spins along the field direction , resulting in a classical paramagnetic state that is naturally a product of single - site paramagnets , with all quantum correlations washed away . indeed , as we can see from the left inset of fig .",
    "[ figwithout ] , the true quantum oscillations in the schmidt gap appear to be confined up to a value of the external field @xmath146 , which , somehow , corresponds to an _ inverted , de - complexified _ factorization point .",
    "therefore , a sort of would - be factorizing field seems to play a very important role also in models that do not admit a physical factorized ground state .",
    "a complete , rigorous confirmation of these behaviors for all values of the transverse field @xmath8 in non - integrable models is beyond our current numerical possibilities for two reasons : firstly , the differences between rnyi entropies of the same order @xmath55 and different partition size @xmath3 fall off extremely rapidly with @xmath8 ; moreover , the limitations on current algorithms do not allow a reliable analysis for partitions of size @xmath147 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the algorithm is based on the direct computation of the two - site density matrix of the two central sites of the dmrg ansatz .",
    "the further density matrices , e.g. the four - site density matrix , are obtained by repeated merging of two physical sites in one computational site .",
    "this protocol is very effective in obtaining all quantities of interest but , as the local dimension of the computational sites increases exponentially with the number of physical sites grouped together , it prevents at the moment going beyond blocks of size @xmath147 .",
    "if further confirmed by future more powerful numerical analysis , the reported behavior would imply that the entanglement - induced order can exist also in disordered phases with vanishing local order parameters .",
    "we have investigated the scaling behavior of the entanglement spectrum and of the rnyi entanglement entropies in the ground state of one - dimensional gapped and gapless quantum spin models .",
    "we have showed that a violation of the area law scaling behavior occurs both in the critical and non - critical cases for all rnyi entropies of order @xmath148 and for external fields @xmath149 in models admitting ground - state factorization .",
    "an analogous behavior is observed in the schmidt gap , that is the difference between the two largest eigenvalues of the block reduced density matrix .",
    "the existence of a factorizing field and the associated anomalous scaling of the entanglement spectrum correspond to the existence of a quantum regime superimposed to and distinct from the ordered and disordered phases associated to the existence of ground states breaking some symmetry of the hamiltonian . unlike long - range magnetic order due to spontaneous symmetry breaking , this finite - range , entanglement - driven order does not rely on the onset of ground - state degeneracy , but is rather due to the entanglement properties of each ground state of fixed parity .",
    "the factorizing field plays a key role in the understanding of the anomalous scaling of the entanglement spectrum by clarifying the origin of this phenomenon even in the gapless case in which the factorization point and the critical point coincide .",
    "it also explains why the anomalous scaling is not observed in systems , like the ising model , for which @xmath150 . for non - integrable models that do not admit factorization , the oscillatory scaling appears to extend to all values of the external field , while the non - monotonic behavior of the schmidt gap appears to be confined in the region @xmath151 .",
    "however , further numerical analyses will be required in order to reach a definite assessment for such models .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction  @xcite , a new quantum revolution is taking place in condensed matter physics inasmuch as it is being recognized that there are kinds of quantum phases that are truly and uniquely characterized by their entanglement properties , the paramount example being the quantum spin liquid phase associated to a nonvanishing topological entanglement entropy for some classes of two - dimensional , geometrically frustrated quantum spin systems ( e.g. the heisenberg model on the kagom lattice ) .",
    "in fact , this fundamental realization has motivated the characterization and classification of quantum phases according to equivalence classes of entanglement : for instance , ground states endowed with topological order are characterized by a constant , topological entanglement entropy of infinite spatial range .",
    "therefore , they can not be adiabatically connected to ground states with short - range entanglement patterns without crossing a quantum phase transition . in particular , phases endowed with topological order are not compatible with factorized ground states , the latter being a particular element of the equivalence class of states with short - range entanglement  @xcite .",
    "the above holds true ( although a rigorous proof is still lacking ) for two- and higher - dimensional systems , where topological effects con occur independently of the presence or absence of symmetries . in one - dimensional systems",
    ", it has been conjectured that topological phases can occur only if the associated ground states share some given symmetry and can not be adiabatically deformed into each other without crossing a quantum phase transition , if the deformation preserves that symmetry  @xcite , leading to a classification of gapped symmetric phases in one - dimensional spin systems  @xcite .",
    "this is certainly not the case for the exchange quantum spin-1/2 chains that we have discussed in the present work . on the other hand ,",
    "the conjecture puts the role of the factorized ground state at the center stage of the investigation , and for models that are thought of possessing true symmetry - protected topological phases in one dimension , our methods for the study of ground - state factorization could be applied in order to verify the conjecture in explicit model hamiltonians in one dimension .",
    "frustration , a crucial ingredient for the realization of topological phases in two dimensions , appears to be an important factor in one - dimensional systems as well .",
    "we have noticed that the single - copy entanglement @xmath48 is monotonic in the bipartite geometric entanglement @xmath100 , which in turn has been shown to be a universal lower bound to ground - state frustration , independently of the spatial dimension  @xcite .",
    "this correspondence suggests the existence of an intimate relation between the scaling of the entanglement spectrum , the tendency to form ordered entangled structures below the factorization point , and the frustration of purely quantum origin .",
    "in such a perspective , the present investigation might be further fruitfully extended to geometrically frustrated models and systems with topological order and other classes of exotic quantum phases .",
    "finally , the fact that the factorization point has been identified to constitute the boundary point for different types of scaling of the ground - state entanglement suggests that the presence of factorization might impose fundamental limits to trotterization and other classes of adiabatic methods  @xcite for the simulatability of quantum many - body hamiltonians .",
    "this crucial point of great practical importance will be the subject of forthcoming work .",
