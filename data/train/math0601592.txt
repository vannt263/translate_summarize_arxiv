    "the free monoid @xmath0 of words over the alphabet @xmath1 ordered by the prefix relation has a @xmath2-regular rooted tree structure in which the empty word is the root and the words of length @xmath3 constitute the level @xmath3 in the tree .",

    "any automorphism @xmath8 of @xmath7 can be ( uniquely ) decomposed as @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is called the _ root permutation _ of @xmath8 , and @xmath11 , @xmath6 , are tree automorphisms , called the ( first level ) _ sections _ of @xmath8 .",
    "the root permutation @xmath12 and the sections @xmath13 are determined uniquely by the relation @xmath14 , for all @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the action of a tree automorphism can be extended to an isometric action on the boundary @xmath17 consisting of the infinite words over @xmath18 .",
    "the space @xmath19 is a compact ultrametric space homeomorphic to a cantor set .    for any permutation @xmath20 in @xmath21 define a @xmath2-ary tree automorphism @xmath22 by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the identity automorphism if @xmath25 is in the support of @xmath20 and @xmath26 otherwise .",
    "the action of the automorphism @xmath27 on @xmath7 is given ( recursively ) by @xmath28 _ hanoi towers group on @xmath2 pegs _ , @xmath29 , is the group @xmath30 of @xmath2-ary tree automorphisms generated by the automorphisms @xmath27 , @xmath31 , corresponding to the transpositions in @xmath21 .",

    "@xmath3 disks of distinct sizes , enumerated @xmath33 by their size , are placed on @xmath2 pegs , denoted @xmath34 .",
    "any configuration of disks is allowed as long as no disk is placed on top of a smaller disk . a legal move consists of moving the top disk from one peg to the top of another peg ( as long as the new configuration is allowed ) .",
    "the @xmath3-disk configurations are in bijective correspondence with the @xmath35 words of length @xmath3 over @xmath1 .",
    "namely , the word @xmath36 over @xmath18 corresponds to the unique configuration in which the disk @xmath25 , @xmath37 , is placed on peg @xmath38 .",
    "the action of the automorphism @xmath27 corresponds to a move between the pegs @xmath25 and @xmath39 .",
    "the group @xmath32 , @xmath29 , is an example of an automaton group . in general ,",
    "an _ invertible automaton _ is a quadruple @xmath40 in which @xmath41 is a finite set of states , @xmath18 a finite alphabet , @xmath42 a _ transition function _ and @xmath43 an _ output function _ such that , for each state @xmath44 , the restriction @xmath45 is a permutation in @xmath46 ( see  @xcite ) .",

    "the group of tree automorphisms @xmath53 generated by the automorphisms corresponding to the states of the invertible automaton @xmath47 is called the _ automaton group _ of @xmath47 .",
    "invertible automata are often represented by diagrams such as the one on the left in figure  [ figure ] corresponding to @xmath54 .",
    "each state @xmath49 is labeled by the permutation @xmath48 and the labeled edges describe the transition function ( if @xmath55 then there is an edge labeled @xmath52 connecting @xmath49 to @xmath56 ) .",
    "an automaton group is _ contracting _ if the length ( with respect to the generating set @xmath41 ) of each section @xmath13 , @xmath57 , of @xmath8 is shorter than the length of @xmath8 , for all sufficiently long elements @xmath8 .",
    "a spherically transitive ( transitive on all levels ) group of tree automorphisms @xmath58 is _ regularly branching _ over its subgroup @xmath59 if @xmath59 is a normal subgroup of finite index in @xmath58 such that @xmath60 ( @xmath2 factors ) is a normal subgroup of finite index in @xmath58 that is geometrically contained in @xmath59 ( meaning that the @xmath2 factors act independently on the corresponding @xmath2 subtrees of @xmath7 rooted at the vertices of the first level of @xmath7 ; see  @xcite ) .",
    "the hanoi towers group @xmath61 is contracting and regularly branching over its commutator .",
    "the groups @xmath32 act spherically transitively on @xmath7 , but are not contracting for @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath47 be an automaton , @xmath63 the corresponding automaton group , @xmath64 an infinite geodesic ray starting at the root of @xmath7 , @xmath65 the prefix of @xmath64 of length @xmath3 , @xmath66 the stabilizer @xmath67 and @xmath68 the stabilizer @xmath69 , @xmath70  .",
    "denote by @xmath71 ( or just @xmath72 ) the schreier graph @xmath73 and by @xmath74 the schreier graph @xmath75 , where @xmath41 is the generating set defined by the states of @xmath40 .",
    "we assume that the action of @xmath58 on @xmath7 is spherically transitive .",
    "thus the graphs @xmath74 are connected , have size @xmath35 , @xmath70 , and @xmath58 is infinite .",
    "the graph @xmath74 is indeed the graph of the action of @xmath58 on level @xmath3 in the tree and @xmath72 is the graph of the action on the orbit of @xmath64 in @xmath19 . the sequence of graphs @xmath76 converges to the infinite graph @xmath72 in the space of pointed graphs  @xcite ( based at @xmath65 , @xmath70 , and @xmath64 , respectively ) .",
    "for example , in the case of the hanoi group on 3 pegs @xmath61 the schreier graph @xmath77 is given in figure  [ figure ] ( the automorphisms @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are denoted by @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively in the figure ) .",

    "the growth of @xmath72 is exponential for the automata generating the lamplighter group  @xcite and baumslag - solitar solvable groups  @xcite , the bellaterra automaton  @xcite generating the free product of three cyclic groups of order 2 , and the aleshin automaton  @xcite generating the free group of rank 3 .",
    "thus the schreier graph @xmath72 is amenable , for all hanoi towers groups ( another example providing schreier graphs of intermediate growth is the group studied in  @xcite ) .",

    "denote by @xmath99 the diameter of the graph @xmath74 .",
    "the growth of the diameter function @xmath99 is either exponential , intermediate or polynomial .",
    "since we assumed spherical transitivity of the action , we have that the schreier graphs @xmath74 are connected and @xmath100 .",
    "this implies that if either @xmath99 or @xmath90 grows polynomially then the other one grows exponentially .",

    ", it is well known that @xmath101 for @xmath61 .",
    "it can be shown that examples of polynomial ( even linear ) diameter growth are given by the the realizations of the lamplighter group in  @xcite and by baumslag - solitar solvable groups @xmath102 , @xmath103 , in  @xcite .",
    "thus the hanoi towers groups provide examples with intermediate diameter growth ( for @xmath62 ) .",
    "the classical hanoi towers problem asks for the number of steps needed to reach the configuration @xmath105 from @xmath106 .",
    "it can be shown that this distance is asymptotically equal ( it is not equal ! ) to the diameter @xmath99 .",
    "the frame - stewart algorithm ( see  @xcite ) solves the hanoi towers problem in @xmath107 steps and it follows from the work of szegedy  @xcite that this is asymptotically optimal .",
    "let @xmath108 be the adjacency matrix of @xmath74 and @xmath109 be the corresponding markov operator ( related to the simple random walk on @xmath74 ) .",

    ", i.e.  the diameter growth is linear .",
    "the converse is not true ( the lamplighter and the baumslag - solitar examples have linear diameter growth ) .",
    "examples of automaton groups producing either expanders or intermediate decay of the spectral gap are not known yet .",
    "examples with exponential decay are provided by the first group in  @xcite and @xmath61 .",
    "more generally , for contracting groups the spectral gap decays exponentially since the diameters grow exponentially .",
    "an example with polynomial decay is provided by the lamplighter group  @xcite .",
    "the rate of convergence of @xmath128 to 0 is of special interest and is related to the behavior of the kns spectral measure of @xmath72 and growth of flner sets .",
    "the kns measure @xmath129 is limit of counting measures @xmath130 on @xmath74  @xcite ( @xmath131 is the ratio @xmath132 , where @xmath133 counts the eigenvalues of @xmath74 in @xmath134 ) .",
    "we present here a full description of the spectrum of each 3-regular schreier graph @xmath74 modeling the hanoi towers problem on 3 pegs as well as the spectrum of the 3-regular limit graph @xmath96 and the associated kns spectral measure .",
