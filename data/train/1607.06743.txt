    "in general , the description of quantum mechanical scattering becomes simpler when the relative kinetic energy between the collision partners is negligibly small .",
    "specifically , in this limit the de broglie wavelength of relative motion greatly exceeds the length scale over which the two particles exert forces on one another , rendering details of their interaction , if not insignificant , at least fairly simple to account for  @xcite .",
    "this concept was first articulated by enrico fermi in the context of collisional broadening of spectral lines in a gas of rydberg atoms @xcite ; was instrumental in the understanding of low - energy scattering of neutrons from nuclei @xcite ; and has found expression in modern times as the bedrock upon which our understanding of ultracold gases is based @xcite .",
    "ordinarily , the key aspect of this simplicity is that the scattered state contains only a single ( or very few ) eigenstate(s ) of angular momentum , i.e. , one or only a few partial waves .",
    "ultracold identical bosons have a differential cross section which is isotropic and independent of the collision energy such that a single length scale , referred to as the scattering length , suffices for its description .",
    "the situation is only marginally more complicated for ultracold identical fermions in which the differential cross section is @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the magnitude of the relative wave vector and @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) is a unit vector along the direction of relative incoming ( outgoing ) momentum  @xcite .",
    "once again , a single scalar quantity , the scattering volume , sufficiently characterises the underlying potential .",
    "these simple results dictate many important dynamical properties of quantum gases such as the efficiency of evaporative cooling  @xcite and the speed of sound  @xcite .",
    "however , this situation is radically altered when the potential energy between the collision partners does not decay suitably fast .",
    "if the interaction potential decays as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance separating the two particles , then for @xmath6 a different scenario emerges  @xcite .",
    "ultracold gases containing atoms or molecules which possess magnetic  @xcite or electric  @xcite dipole moments therefore provide a magnificent opportunity to observe a novel regime of low - energy quantum scattering .",
    "when the dipoles are aligned along a chosen axis by an externally applied field , the overall magnitude of the cross section is still determined by a characteristic length scale , the dipole length , which depends on the dipole moment  @xcite .",
    "however , the dipole alignment direction and the @xmath7 asymptotic decay of the interaction potential conspire to create a differential cross section which now involves a very large set of partial waves in an essential way due to the coupling between different angular momentum states .",
    "moreover , it presents a novelty in that such a differential cross section depends explicitly on the relative momenta _ before _ the collision ( as well as after ) with respect to the polarization axis of the dipoles  @xcite .",
    "the consequence of this dependence has been measured indirectly through its effect on the equilibration rate of a dipolar gas , which is taken out of equilibrium by diabatically changing the trap along a certain direction  @xcite .",
    "it was seen that the equilibration rate can vary by as much as a factor of four , depending on the angle between the dipole alignment direction and the dynamic axis of the trap .     and",

    "furthermore , most of these measurements are made in the dilute limit where the majority of particles pass through the opposing condensate without experiencing a collision .",
