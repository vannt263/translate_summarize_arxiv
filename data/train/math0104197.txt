    "@xcite a stability condition for lagrangians in @xmath0 was described , conjectured to be equivalent to the existence of a special lagrangian ( slag ) in the hamiltonian deformation class of a fixed lagrangian .",
    "this was motivated by an infinite dimensional set - up in which @xmath3 gauge transformations act on the ( infinite dimensional ) space of lagrangians with flat @xmath3 connections on them .",
    "there is a natural complex structure and symplectic form on this space and , ignoring issues of integrability of these structures ( see @xcite ) , the formal complexification of the @xmath3 gauge transformations gives hamiltonian deformations of the lagrangian , with moment map the @xmath4-form @xmath5 .",
    "the stability condition was motivated by an example of joyce and the ` angle criterion ' , in terms of splittings of the lagrangian into seidel s graded lagrangian connect sums ( as defined in section [ index ] below ) and family versions thereof , with a certain phase inequality .",
    "this led to a conjecture , a sort of globalised version of the angle criterion @xcite , @xcite , that the hamiltonian deformation class of a lagrangian should contain a slag if and only if the lagrangian is stable ; this slag representative should then be unique . here",
    "we expand on the conjecture and relate it to mean curvature flow .",
    "it was verified for the simplest case @xmath6 in @xcite ; here we prove it in a series of @xmath4-dimensional examples with symmetry ( theorem [ faq ] ) , and prove uniqueness of smooth slags in hamiltonian deformation classes whose floer cohomology @xcite is defined ( theorem [ ! ] ) .    we write @xmath7 for `` in the same hamiltonian deformation class as '' , and use @xmath8 for the isomorphism @xmath9 induced by the metric on a riemannian manifold @xmath10 . restricting the ricci - flat metric on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath11 to a lagrangian submanifold @xmath10 we get an induced volume form @xmath12 on @xmath10 , and by a short calculation @xmath13 defines an @xmath14-valued function @xmath15 on @xmath10 , the _ phase function of _ @xmath10 .",
    "a _ grading _ of @xmath10 is a lift of @xmath15 to a real valued function . by lagrangian",
    "we will always mean graded lagrangian ( thus the maslov class of the lagrangian , which is the class of @xmath16 in @xmath17 , is assumed to vanish , and we have chosen a lift of @xmath15 ) .",
    "@xmath10 is special lagrangian ( slag ) if @xmath15 is a constant ; equivalently , replacing @xmath2 by @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "an average , cohomological , measure of the phase of a homology class @xmath20 $ ] is given by taking the phase of the complex number @xmath21 ; for @xmath10 graded with the variation of @xmath15 less than @xmath22 , this lifts naturally to give a real number @xmath23 , which is the phase of any slag in the same homology class .",
    "we should point out that as in @xcite , we do not fully understand the role of holomorphic discs in the theory .",
    "these are of course crucial in the definition and hamiltonian deformation invariance of floer cohomology ; until this is fully set up @xcite and all of its expected properties ( such as the spectral sequences of @xcite and @xcite ) are proved and extended to the calabi - yau case , some of the arguments below are necessarily conjectural ; it will be clear which ones .",
    "we also deal exclusively with smooth ( s)lags ; how to modify our constructions to include singularities is an important question .",
    "using only ( family ) lagrangian connect sums as the degenerations necessary to describe stability of lagrangians is also probably too restrictive , studying other singularities and splittings may also be necessary ; the conjecture in this paper is probably just the first step in understanding slags in hamiltonian isotopy classes",

    "we first give a well - known geometric calculation which we learnt from unpublished lectures of rick schoen on his work with jon wolfson , but which dates back at least as far as @xcite , @xcite and others .",
    "[ mcf ] in the above notation , the mean curvature vector of the lagrangian @xmath24 is @xmath25 .",
    "we want to show that for any vector @xmath0 tangent to @xmath10 , @xmath26 .    picking an orthonormal basis of @xmath27 and parallel transporting it along rays in @xmath10 to a frame field @xmath28 , @xmath29 forms a local basis for @xmath30 around @xmath31 .",
    "letting @xmath32 be the dual basis of 1-forms , it is clear that at @xmath31 , @xmath33 with @xmath15 the phase function of @xmath10 . since @xmath2 is parallel , @xmath34 yields @xmath35 \\bigwedge_j(f_j+ig_j ) .",

    "but as @xmath38 and @xmath0 are orthogonal , this is @xmath39 as we may choose @xmath0 to have zero bracket with the @xmath40s .",
    "so comparing with ( [ formula ] ) we are left with showing that @xmath41 = i\\sum_i\\langle e_i , j\\nabla_xe_i\\rangle,\\ ] ] i.e. that @xmath42 .",
    "but @xmath43 is a constant , so the left hand side is @xmath44 ; the other terms vanish as @xmath45 was chosen to be perpendicular to @xmath10 . using @xmath46 and recalling that @xmath47",
    ", we obtain @xmath48 .",
    "another simple but important result is how the phase @xmath15 and volume form @xmath49 vary under a hamiltonian deformation @xmath50 of @xmath10 .",
    "such calculations appear in various forms in @xcite , @xcite , for instance ; we give short geometric proofs for completeness .    under a hamiltonian deformation @xmath51 of a lagrangian @xmath10 ,",
    "we have @xmath52    take real and imaginary parts of @xmath53 times the following : @xmath54 setting @xmath55 @xmath56 in geodesic coordinates ) gives the result .",
    "we next show that , given a suitable metric on the lie algebra @xmath57 , the gradient flow of the norm square @xmath58 of the moment map @xmath59 of @xcite is mean curvature flow .",
    "the following standard calculation , applicable in any khler reduction picture , shows that the gradient flow of @xmath58 is given by @xmath60 , where @xmath37 is the complex structure , @xmath61 is the element of the lie algebra @xmath62 corresponding to the moment map @xmath59 in the dual of the lie algebra under the metric on @xmath62 , and @xmath63 is its induced action on the space \\{lagrangians with flat @xmath3 connections on them}. @xmath64 by the definition of the group action in @xcite , this deformation @xmath60 is just the hamiltonian deformation of the lagrangian @xmath10 with hamiltonian function @xmath61 on @xmath10 .    choosing the volume form re@xmath65 on @xmath10 to define an @xmath66 metric on @xmath62 gives @xmath67 , since @xmath68vol@xmath69re@xmath65 . similarly using the induced riemannian volume form vol gives @xmath70 , while using @xmath71 as volume form on @xmath10 yields @xmath72 .",
    "any of these are suitable for small phase @xmath73 , and give similar flows down which the moment map decreases .",
    "the last one , however , is precisely mean curvature flow , by lemma [ mcf ] .",
    "this and the previous lemma show that under mean curvature flow , the phase @xmath15 satisfies a ( time dependent ) heat equation while the riemannian volume form decreases ( as usual ) : @xmath74 we therefore obtain a maximum principle for @xmath15 , whose range must always decrease , but it is important to note that the laplacian @xmath75 is time dependent as the metric on @xmath10 used to define it varies .    from these",
    "follow a series of identities and estimates , many of which we use later , but none are strong enough to give long term existence of the mean curvature flow , and with good reason .",
    "mean curvature flow is a complicated and much - studied subject ( understood only in codimension 1 , dimension 1 @xcite , and , in special cases , in two dimensions @xcite ) , with known examples of finite time blow - up .",
    "while we might expect it to behave better for lagrangians ( locally functions of one variable instead of @xmath4 ) , examples in section [ eg ] show similar phenomena .",
    "but in our examples there will be a way round these problems , and we will be able to make a conjecture about the flow which may help in its study .",
    "the stability definition in @xcite made extensive use of graded lagrangian connect sums @xcite ; a description of these and their relationship to floer cohomology will be important again here , as will knowledge of the floer index of lagrangian intersections .",
    "we fix our conventions and definitions now ; in some places these differ in orientation from some of the mirror symmetry literature and @xcite ; the problem seems to be deciding on whether to use the standard symplectic form @xmath76 on @xmath6 , or the equally standard @xmath77 considering it as the cotangent bundle of its syz base @xmath14 ( divided by a lattice ) @xcite .",
    "suppose we have two lagrangians @xmath78 hamiltonian isotoped to intersect transversally in a finite number of points .",
    "we will work at one of these points @xmath31 .",
    "there we can pick a local darboux chart with coordinates @xmath79 and symplectic form @xmath80 such that @xmath81 is the @xmath82-axes , and @xmath83 for some @xmath84 .",
    "( it would be more usual to use @xmath85 , of course , but that situation can be moved to this one by an obvious symplectic ( shear ) transformation ) .",
    "using @xmath86 coordinates to set up the obvious isomorphism to @xmath87 ( notice that this complex structure and that inherited from @xmath0 may be different ) , the @xmath88 are @xmath89 where @xmath90 is set to zero to give @xmath91 .",
    "so given a curve @xmath92 in @xmath93 , we define a lagrangian @xmath94 then @xmath91 is represented by @xmath95 , @xmath96 by @xmath97 , and @xmath98 by the v - shaped union of these curves .    in this notation the _ lagrangian connect sum _",
    "@xmath99 is represented by any smoothing @xmath100 of @xmath101 staying inside the cone @xmath102\\}$ ] which is @xmath101 outside a compact set , and a smooth curve cutting off the cone at the origin .",
    "( so here @xmath92 is _ not _ a connect sum of the curves @xmath103 in the topological sense ; we only use the notation because the resulting lagrangians are topological connect sums . )",
    "we want to analyse the phase of such a connect sum ; initially in the complex structure we picked on @xmath104 using the @xmath105 coordinates and so , up to scale , @xmath106 .",
    "then the phase function of the lagrangian @xmath107 associated to a curve @xmath92 is easily calculated to be @xmath108 for any @xmath109 ( where @xmath110 $ ] is the phase of a complex number @xmath111 ) .",
    "orienting @xmath112 such that @xmath113 is a positive real number , and choosing @xmath91 to have phase 0 , corresponds to choosing @xmath114 and so grading @xmath96 by @xmath115 in particular , choosing @xmath116 , and setting , for any @xmath117 , @xmath118 gives a slag @xmath107 which has a grading of phase identically zero , asymptotic to @xmath96 and @xmath91 at infinity , and this is precisely the local model of the example of joyce , harvey and lawlor used so extensively in @xcite .    while this is not strictly of the form @xmath119 as defined above ( it is only asymptotic to the @xmath103 , not equal outside a compact set ) , by taking @xmath120 small we can make it as close as we like to such a connect sum , all in the same hamiltonian deformation class , and the construction of joyce is indeed a hamiltonian deformation of a connect sum as claimed in @xcite .",
    "we plot these slag curves @xmath121 in figure 1 as the light lines , converging as @xmath122 to the v - shaped @xmath101 ( with @xmath116 ) .",
    "then the dark lines depict connect sums @xmath99 for @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "if @xmath125 , the _ stable case _ as described in @xcite , then we can choose the connect sum such that the phase of @xmath99 varies monotonically between its values on @xmath96 and @xmath91 , i.e. between @xmath126 and 0 .    if , however , @xmath127 , the _ unstable case _ in @xcite , then the phase of @xmath99 must initially decrease to move away from @xmath91 before increasing to reach @xmath96 ( i.e. @xmath92 must cross the light lines one way then the other ) , giving a phase function which necessarily goes outside the range @xmath128 ( see figure 1 ) . this will be important to us later  under mean curvature flow we expect the phase function @xmath15 to evolve to a constant in the stable case ( under the heat equation ( [ thetadot ] ) ) and to a heaviside step function ( with values @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) in the unstable case .",
    "this does not then contradict the maximum principle as the unstable case has the described non - monotonic phase .    while this defines the symplectic connect sum in general by means of our darboux chart , the analysis of phases depended on the choice of complex structure on @xmath131 , which may not have been the one restricted from the calabi - yau @xmath0 . in the general case we can fix @xmath132 , without loss of generality , by rotating @xmath2 , and pick local complex coordinates @xmath86 such that @xmath133 and , at the level of tangent spaces at @xmath31 , ( the tangent space to ) @xmath91 is at @xmath134 .",
    "( the tangent space to ) @xmath96 will be of the form @xmath135 for some @xmath136s that are _ no longer necessarily all the same _ in these coordinates .",
    "we are now connect summing lagrangians of pointwise phase @xmath129 and @xmath137 ( compare ( [ pa ] ) ) , but the resulting phase function will not be as simple as before ",
    "it is not pulled back from @xmath92 but will vary over the @xmath138 fibres .",
    "its average phase over the @xmath138s will have a similar form to that in figure 1 , however , and in the case of all the @xmath136s being the same we get the earlier simpler picture .",
    "the dependence of the hamiltonian deformation class of @xmath99 on the choice of scale of the neck at each intersection point was described in ( @xcite section 4 ) ( in particular if there is only one intersection point the class is uniquely defined ) .",
    "we should also point out that the graded connect sum ( when it exists ) is also independent of hamiltonian deformations of @xmath96 and @xmath91 . while the @xmath88s intersect transversely",
    "this is clear ; we need only understand what happens in crossing the codimension one wall of lagrangians intersecting in a double point ( i.e. creating or cancelling two intersection points ) .",
    "but it will be clear from the definition of grading below that two such points must have grading differing by one , and so the connect sum along both of them can not be graded ( [ grhash ] ) .",
    "the floer cohomology group @xmath139 @xcite is the cohomology of a cochain complex made from a copy of @xmath93 for each intersection point of two _ graded _ lagrangians hamiltonian isotoped to intersect transversally .",
    "the differential is defined by counting holomorphic strips , with boundary in the lagrangians , running from one intersection point to another .",
    "it is a symplectic refinement of the topological intersection theory of @xmath78 , and as such is invariant only under hamiltonian deformations of the @xmath88 .",
    "what is important to us is the grading of a particular transverse intersection point , as defined in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "while this can be defined completely topologically , it is most easily ( and equivalently ) defined via a complex structure .",
    "again we work at the level of tangent spaces , pick local coordinates and , without loss of generality , take @xmath91 to have phase 0 and to be the @xmath82-axes : @xmath81 .",
    "write @xmath96 as @xmath140 _ where the @xmath136s are all in _ @xmath141",
    ". then @xmath142 mod @xmath143 is the phase of @xmath96 up to multiples of @xmath143 , and the following integer is the _ definition _ of the floer index of the point @xmath31 : @xmath144 notice therefore that @xmath145 . applying the definition ( [ maslov ] ) to the connect sums defined in the last section ( for which @xmath146 ) ,",
    "we recover a result of seidel @xcite : @xmath147 ( the only if part follows from the independence of gradings and the floer index from the complex structure ; we may therefore pick the complex structure locally to have the form of the local model above . )",
    "given @xmath96 there is at most one choice of the grading on @xmath91 such that @xmath148 at all intersection points @xmath31 , so that @xmath99 can be graded .    in fact connect sums @xmath99 whose own floer cohomology is well defined @xcite should correspond to floer coclosed cochains , i.e. elements of @xmath149 , mirror to the fact that extensions of sheaves @xmath150 correspond to elements of ext@xmath151 , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we can also deal with the connect sums mentioned in @xcite which are _ relative _ versions of the above construction ; @xmath152-dimensional connect sums carried out in a smooth family over an @xmath153-dimensional base .",
    "then the same floer index can be defined ; there are now @xmath153 angles between the lagrangians that are zero , and @xmath152 whose signs can be computed to get the floer index .",
    "( the signs are constant over the family since the intersection of the lagrangians @xmath154 fibres over the base of the family with fibres of constant dimension ; an angle going to zero would cause a fibre dimension to increase . )",
    "in finite dimensional symplectic quotient problems , convexity properties of the moment map prove uniqueness of its zeros ( modulo the action of the real group ) in a complexified group orbit .",
    "translating this into our terms is not quite possible , because there are hamiltonian deformations of @xmath10 which are not given by the flow of a _ fixed _",
    "hamiltonian on @xmath10 . by this",
    "we mean @xmath155 are deformations given by a constant hamiltonian @xmath156 if the flow @xmath157,\\ ] ] takes @xmath158 to @xmath159 .",
    "all small deformations of a lagrangian are of this form ; for more general deformations we have to use a different proof of uniqueness of a slag representative of a hamiltonian deformation class ( proposition [ ! ] below ) , but for these constant hamiltonian deformations we describe the moment map proof to show how the formalism works .    [ ? ] if two slags @xmath155 are time - independent hamiltonian deformations of each other , in the sense above , then @xmath160 .    without loss of generality we may take @xmath161",
    ". then we compute , down the flow ( [ flow ] ) , @xmath162 where the last identity ( equation ( 3.2 ) of @xcite ) is an easy computation in local coordinates .",
    "( we have abused notation and written @xmath163 for @xmath164 . )",
    "so for @xmath15 lying in @xmath165 this is always strictly positive , but @xmath166 is zero at @xmath167 .",
    "thus the two slags must in fact coincide .",
    "however , we must show that @xmath15 stays in this range if it starts in it , and deal with the case when it is not so bounded .",
    "the way to do this in fact proves the whole lemma in one go anyway : pick a maximum @xmath168 of @xmath169 . then by ( [ h ] ) @xmath170 , but under the flow @xmath15 starts and ends at the same value ( the _ cohomologically _ determined phase @xmath171 of the slags ) .",
    "so @xmath172 and all the second derivatives @xmath173 in any direction @xmath174 vanish .",
    "similarly then all third derivatives of @xmath169 must vanish ( since we are at a maximum ) .",
    "apply the same procedure to the second derivatives @xmath175 of @xmath169 : @xmath176 at @xmath82 , since the other terms @xmath177\\,h$ ] involve derivatives of the metric times third and lower order derivatives of @xmath169 .",
    "thus @xmath169 s 4th order derivatives vanish , and so on .    to get an integral form of this , to show that @xmath169 is in fact constant",
    ", it is enough to show that @xmath169 is constant in a small ball around any global maximum @xmath82 ( with @xmath178 , without loss of generality ) .",
    "consider geodesic balls @xmath179 of radius @xmath153 about @xmath82 , and their boundary spheres @xmath180 .",
    "fix a standard unit - volume @xmath181-form @xmath182 on the spheres @xmath180 , so that the volume form induced by the metric is @xmath183 , where @xmath184 . for @xmath153",
    "sufficiently small , @xmath185 is bounded by @xmath186 ( for some @xmath187 dependent only on the maximum of the curvatures of @xmath10 in a neighbourhood of @xmath82 over time @xmath188 $ ] of the flow ) . therefore @xmath189 where @xmath190 . integrating over @xmath191 for @xmath192 sufficiently small , and using the divergence theorem , @xmath193 where @xmath194 . since @xmath195 , and @xmath196 ( where the hamiltonian deformation is over time @xmath188 $ ] , and @xmath15 starts and ends at the same value ) , we see that @xmath197 for all small @xmath192 . from this",
    "it follows that @xmath198 .",
    "that is , the average value of @xmath199 over all small spheres surrounding @xmath82 ( averaged over time as the metric on @xmath10 varies ) is zero , and @xmath169 must be identically zero in a neighbourhhod of @xmath82 .",
    "however , we can do better by mirroring the algebro - geometric argument that a non - zero map between stable bundles of the same slope is an isomorphism , using the grading on floer cohomology ( [ maslov ] ) .",
    "this will appear to be slightly magical ; the crux of the argument is the hamiltonian isotopy invariance of floer cohomology , provided by precisely the holomorphic discs in the theory about which we have had so little to say .",
    "again we work in @xmath4 dimensions .    [ ! ] pick a connected graded lagrangian @xmath10 whose obstructions _",
    "@xcite _ to the existence of its floer cohomology vanish , and whose second stieffel - whitney class @xmath200 is the restriction of a class @xmath201 on the whole manifold ( for instance if @xmath10 is spin )",
    ".    then there can be at most one smooth special lagrangian in the hamiltonian deformation class of @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , slag homology spheres are unique in their hamiltonian deformation class in dimension 3 and above .",
    "since floer cohomology is independent of hamiltonian deformations @xcite , any two slags @xmath78 in this same hamiltonian deformation class satisfy @xmath202 given that the zeroth order piece of @xmath203 survives in @xmath204 for @xmath10 with maslov class zero ( @xcite theorem e 1.7.4 ) .",
    "thus there must be at least one intersection point @xmath31 of @xmath96 and @xmath91 .",
    "we first want to show that the ( constant ) phases of the @xmath88 are the same ; all we know a priori is that they differ by @xmath205 for some @xmath206 .",
    "using a hamiltonian perturbation we may assume then that there is at least one transverse intersection between the @xmath88s of floer index 0 , with the phases of the @xmath88 at this point differing by @xmath207 . thus writing , locally , @xmath91 as the graph in @xmath208 of @xmath209 ,",
    "@xmath210 has morse index @xmath153 at the intersection point , so @xmath211 .",
    "similarly there is a point of floer index @xmath4 ( i.e. a point of floer index 0 when the roles of @xmath96 and @xmath91 are reversed ) which must correspond locally to @xmath212 of a function of morse index @xmath213 ; so @xmath214 also . therefore @xmath215 as required .",
    "so we have slags @xmath78 of the same pointwise phase with at least one intersection point which , if isolated , must have floer index ( [ maslov ] ) zero .",
    "thus @xmath216 in ( [ maslov ] ) , and the definition ( [ maslov ] ) of the index is therefore always positive ( in fact between @xmath129 and @xmath4 ) , and zero only if the relative angles @xmath217 . so the @xmath88 are tangent at @xmath31 .",
    "so there is no isolated transverse intersection point of maslov class zero .",
    "in fact , working in a small neighbourhood of the intersection , we may choose coordinates such that @xmath96 is the graph in @xmath218 of a closed one - form @xmath219 on @xmath91 which is also coclosed in a certain metric on @xmath218 in a first order infinitesimal neighbourhood of @xmath91 ( coclosedness is the _ special _ lagrangian condition ) .",
    "in this small open set , write @xmath220 , so that @xmath221 and @xmath210 is harmonic ; thus by the maximum principle , it has no local maxima or minima .",
    "we want to show that @xmath210 is in fact constant . the floer index ( [ maslov ] ) of intersection points @xmath222 now reduces to the morse index of @xmath210 at isolated critical points , but we also have to deal with degenerate critical points of @xmath210 .",
    "assuming for a contradiction that the critical set of @xmath210 is not all of @xmath91 , we may perturb @xmath210 inside any connected component of a small neighbourhood of its critical set such that its value is unchanged on the boundary , _ where it attains its global maximum and minimum _ , and is morse in the interior .",
    "( that we may take the extrema to be on the boundary is the key point and a consequence of the maximum principle . )",
    "we can then perturb @xmath210 further to arrange its index 1 critical points to be lower ( with respect to @xmath210 ) than all higher index points ( by general position arguments @xcite theorem 4.8 ) and then cancel any local minima with them ( @xcite theorem 8.1 ) .",
    "( there must be index 1 critical points if there are any interior minima , by connectivity of our neighbourhood . )",
    "the upshot is a hamiltonian perturbation of @xmath96 , using this new function , with no floer index zero intersection points with @xmath91 .",
    "thus @xmath223 , a contradiction , so in fact @xmath210 was locally constant and @xmath224 .",
    "the final statement follows from the fact that the obstructions of @xcite live in @xmath225 , and homology spheres are spin .",
    "as donaldson pointed out , this proof is similar in flavour to proofs of the arnold conjecture . if the local situation ( of all hamiltonian deformations coming from a fixed function ) held globally , the proof would be ` trivial ' , i.e. that of lemma [ ? ] above .",
    "even more simply , if one slag is a graph in the cotangent bundle of another , we reduce the problem to the uniqueness of harmonic functions of integral zero on @xmath10 , i.e. to @xmath226 . to extend this argument",
    "globally we need to replace de rham cohomology @xmath227 by floer cohomology @xmath228 .",
    "in this section we discuss more properties of ( s)lags that mirror those of holomorphic vector bundles on calabi - yau manifolds . as they rely heavily on floer cohomology arguments , many of the topics",

    "if we assume the conjectures of @xcite and section [ conj ] below , and the properties of floer cohomology @xcite for all of the above lagrangians ( e.g. if they are homology spheres ) , we can demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of the jordan - hlder filtration for a lagrangian @xmath10 whose phase function of @xmath10 satisfies @xmath268 .    without loss of generality we may assume ( by rotating @xmath2 ) that @xmath15 lies between @xmath269 and @xmath270 , for some @xmath271 . by the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) above , then , any @xmath272 destabilising it will satisfy @xmath273 .",

    "we claim that such an @xmath96 must be stable by construction .",
    "any subobject of @xmath275 would also be a subobject of @xmath10 and so by the construction of @xmath96 must either have smaller phase , which is not possible since it destabilises @xmath96 , or equal phase and greater or equal cohomological volume . but",
    "@xmath276 , where @xmath277 has phase @xmath278 and so positive cohomological volume @xmath279 .",
    "so the complex numbers @xmath280 all have positive real part , implying that the cohomological volume of @xmath281 is strictly less that that of @xmath96 , a contradiction .",

    "this should follow from standard facts about floer cohomology , in particular a long exact sequence @xmath294 .",
    "for @xmath262 a sphere this is seidel s exact sequence ( @xcite theorem 3.3 ) , and in general one can establish it at the level of chains by good choices of hamiltonian perturbations as in section [ ssl ] ; as usual the problem is in controlling the differential , i.e. holomorphic discs .    assuming this we may pass to @xmath91 ; inductively we eventually obtain that @xmath260 is isomorphic to one of the graded pieces @xmath295 of the original filtration , and is a subobject of @xmath296 but not of @xmath88 . but",
    "this gives us a contradiction ( in contrast to the sheaf analogue ) , since we have that both @xmath297 and @xmath260 is a subobject of @xmath296 .",
    "the first condition ensures that there are representatives of the hamiltonian deformation classes such that @xmath296 and @xmath260 have no index @xmath4 intersection points by the construction of ( [ hom ] ) , so that @xmath298 . but",

    "+ so in the simplest case of instability , such as the example of joyce considered in @xcite , where @xmath238 is the only relevant decomposition of @xmath10 with @xmath301 , the jordan - hlder decomposition ( [ decomp ] ) would be simply @xmath98 ( where the @xmath88 are slag representatives of their classes ) .",
    "this , like all such decompositions , is in the closure of the hamiltonian deformation orbit of @xmath10 while not being in the orbit itself .",
    "this should have relevance to the schoen - wolfson programme @xcite to find canonical representatives ( in a fixed hamiltonian deformation class ) of lagrangian homology classes using volume minimisers and so slags ( they do not use a flow , but regularity results to study minimising currents ) . our conjecture ( as in @xcite and later in section [ conj ] )",
    "should either provide a unique slag in a hamiltonian deformation class , or a number of slags in a jordan - hlder decomposition .",
    "for instance in the example above of @xmath99 in 2 dimensions we would produce slags in the classes of @xmath96 and @xmath91 , but we could also form @xmath302 ; this could then be stable ( it is no longer destabilised by either of the @xmath88 ; if the phases of the @xmath88 are sufficiently close one can show that in fact nothing else destabilises it either ) and we should recover a slag in this class ( and so in the same homology class in two dimensions ) .",
    "since in two dimensions slags are just holomorphic curves with respect to a different complex structure , this places heavy restrictions on stability .",
    "take the @xmath88 above to be spheres in @xmath303 surfaces .",
    "then any holomorphic sphere is unique in its homology class ( it has negative self intersection @xmath304 , so does not lie in a pencil ) . any other homologous hamiltonian deformation class must therefore be unstable .",
    "good examples are provided by taking a stable ( slag / holomorphic ) sphere , and applying the square of a dehn twist @xmath305 to it ; this preserves homology classes but can change hamiltonian deformation classes .",
    "if it does it should produce an unstable lagrangian with copies of @xmath96 in its jordan - hlder decomposition ; this happens in all simple cases .",
    "@xmath99 is taken to @xmath302 , for instance ; only one of these can be stable , the other having a jordan - hlder decomposition @xmath98 in the simplest case .",
    "more generally , instead of studying the action on individual ( s)lags of symplectomorphisms like @xmath305 above , we could try to study them all at once by studying the lagrangian graph of the symplectomorphism in @xmath306 , and its mean curvature flow .",
    "this looks for minimal energy representatives of the hamiltonian isotopy class of a symplectomorphism , and breaks graphs up into correspondences representing singular maps ( birational maps in the hyperkhler case ) with singularities concentrated in loci whose stability is affected by the symplectomorphism . for a dehn twist @xmath235 , for instance , we would expect to get the graph @xmath75 of the identity , union @xmath307 .",
    "this also shows what the analogue of a dehn twist @xmath235 should be when @xmath10 is not a sphere but a rational homology sphere ( so that it is still spherical to complex coefficients , and so mirror to a twist on the derived category of sheaves on the mirror calabi - yau @xcite ) .",
    "namely @xmath308 is a lagrangian correspondence in @xmath306 which should give an automorphism of the derived fukaya category of @xmath0 ( by the usual fourier - mukai - type construction ) _ not _ induced by a symplectomorphism of @xmath0 .",
    "here we consider an example suggested to us by both paul seidel and cumrun vafa , used in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "consider the affine algebraic variety @xmath309 given by @xmath310 in @xmath311 , where @xmath31 is some polynomial in @xmath312 with only simple zeros .",
    "denote by @xmath313 the projection to the @xmath314 coordinate .",
    "here we use the khler structure restricted from @xmath315 , and the nowhere - zero holomorphic volume form given by taking the poincar residue ( @xcite p 147 ) of the standard form @xmath316 on @xmath315 ; this can be written as @xmath317 for any @xmath267 ( so where @xmath318 we can use the second expression ) . here",
    "@xmath319 means that we omit the @xmath320 term from the wedge product .",
    "this is then _ not _ parallel , and the metric we have chosen is _ not the ricci - flat one_. nonetheless it is a good explicit testing ground for the conjecture ; we can still define @xmath15 as the phase of @xmath65 and slags as having constant phase , of course we then use flow by the @xmath321 vector , rather than mean curvature flow in this metric",
    ". while the two flows are similar and would be the same in the ricci - flat metric , only the former has slags as its stationary points ( for the latter we get minimal submanifolds , which in this metric are not quite slag ) .",
    "as edward goldstein pointed out to us , the @xmath321 flow is the gradient flow of the weighted volume functional @xmath322 instead of @xmath323 ; everything proceeds analogously to before on weighting all vols by @xmath324 , as we shall see .",
    "each smooth fibre over @xmath312 is an affine quadric with a natural lagrangian @xmath138 ` real ' slice , namely the intersection of the fibre with the slice @xmath325 it is invariant under the obvious @xmath326 action on @xmath309 , and is the vanishing cycle of every singular fibre ( i.e. the fibres over the roots of @xmath31 ) .",

    ", we might expect better on @xmath360 .",
    "this is more or less true ; the result is that writing ( [ result4 ] ) in terms of the unit normal @xmath386 _ on _ @xmath360 , we get    [ result ! ] @xmath387    the last term is bounded ( as near a zero of @xmath31 , @xmath388 by nondegeneracy of @xmath31 s zeros ) and so unimportant , we shall see , and the flow resulting from the first term is well understood .",
    "the second term is more curious ; it is of the order of @xmath389 ( where @xmath390 denotes differentiation with respect to arclength on @xmath360 ) whenever we are close to a point where @xmath92 emanates from a zero of @xmath31 ( so that @xmath391 and @xmath392 ) .",

    "these unions of slags of different phases are still stationary for the volume functional ( satisfying the second order variational equations , just not the first order slag equations ) , and in fact are minimising in odd dimensions ( the angle criterion @xcite , @xcite makes minimality of the singular union locally equivalent to the above destabilising phase condition ; in even dimensions reversing the order of the lagrangians reverses the inequality and the configuration is not minimal , just stationary ) .",
    "again we see how the phase or angle criterion comes to bear ; curves 1 and 2 are in the same homology class , but the two different phase signs give very different results . as noted before in figure 1 , this is related to the necessity of the phase to vary non - monotonically to form the unstable connect sum ; in figure 3 we plot the phases of the two connect sums , and with dotted lines their limits under the heat flow ( [ newdot ] ) ( this is the correct modification of ( [ thetadot ] ) in the non ricci - flat case ) .",
    "drawing @xmath92 the other way round the zero of @xmath31 gives something in the same homology class ( the dehn twist around the root of @xmath31 does not alter the homology class of the @xmath14 fibre over @xmath92 ) , which is the opposite connect sum discussed in @xcite  once the phase inequality becomes unstable for one connect sum it becomes stable for the other .",

    "it is quite possible for a curve corresponding to a _",
    "lagrangian , which is nonetheless very far from being a slag , to pass close to a zero of @xmath31 without the large negative curvature away from the zero that the slags exhibit .",
    "it can then flow into the zero , the lagrangian being split into unions of lagrangians of which it was a connect sum , despite their phases being such that they do not destabilise it .",

    "it is only in the locus of points of quot representing semistable sheaves that the stable orbits are closed . )",
    "the point about stable lagrangians is that _ this can be avoided _ by choosing a hamiltonian deformation of the lagrangian to have sufficiently small variation in phase @xmath15 ( or sufficiently small volume ) that it can not be split into destabilising lagrangians of different phase ( or higher total volume ) ; this we discuss now .",

    "if @xmath10 satisfies either of the conditions ( [ close ] ) or ( [ vclose ] ) then mean curvature flow for @xmath10 exists for all time and converges to a special lagrangian in its hamiltonian deformation class ; the unique slag conjectured in _ @xcite_.",
    "it is of course a consequence of this and the conjecture in @xcite that some hamiltonian deformation of @xmath10 satisfies ( [ close ] ) if and only if it is stable .",
    "the slag should also be unique in its hamiltonian deformation class as in theorem [ ! ] . if @xmath10 is stable but not close enough to being slag that ( [ close ] ) fails , then mean curvature flow can become singular in finite time , ( locally ) splitting the lagrangian in the reverse of a connect sum operation ( i.e. with a vanishing cycle which is an @xmath138 , or an @xmath413-bundle over an @xmath414-dimensional base in the relative connect sum case ) .",

    "this splitting of the lagrangian is a manifestation of the well known finite - time dumb - bell singularities in mean curvature flow .      under our flow ( [ result ! ] ) in the shapere - vafa example the proofs of the evolution equations for the phase function @xmath15 ( [ thetadot ] ) and volume ( [ voldot ] ) show that the equations are modified ( as the metric is not quite ricci - flat ) to @xmath416 when @xmath417 is not @xmath418",

    "@xmath103 in the base , and also @xmath421 .",
    "then the flow ( [ result ! ] ) exists for all time and converges in @xmath422 to a smooth curve whose phase function ( [ pf ] ) is constant .",
    "we break the proof up into existence of the flow ( best dealt with at the level of @xmath423 ) , controlling the angle variation ( using @xmath359 ) to ensure no @xmath424 kinks appear in @xmath92 , and using this to show the flow exists for all time ( for which we use the double cover @xmath393 and @xmath15 on @xmath330 ) .",
    "we follow @xcite , in parts heavily modified to take care of the endpoints of @xmath92 .",
    "finally we will show that the flow converges to a slag .",
    "firstly , short term existence of the flow , given any initial curve @xmath359 missing the zeros of @xmath31 except at its endpoints and _ such that @xmath337 is @xmath425 _ for some @xmath426 ( i.e. @xmath337 has hlder continuous curvature ) , is in fact most easily proved at the level of the @xmath425 lagrangian @xmath330 ; see @xcite for the method in 1 dimension ( which easily generalises to @xmath4 dimensions ) , and @xcite for a similar @xmath4-dimensional result .",
    "this is also done in ( @xcite proposition 1.6 ) using results of hamilton @xcite , for instance .    while the curvature of the curve @xmath393 is bounded , so is the norm of the flow vector ( the last term in ( [ result ! ] ) is always bounded , and the second term can be bounded by the curvature at an intermediate point by taylor s theorem ) .",
    "so at any finite time @xmath427 the flow converges to a limit curve @xmath428 pointwise . parametrising the curves by their arclength on @xmath360 , their first and second derivatives as maps to @xmath360 are therefore bounded , which by arzel - ascoli implies that for a subsequence of @xmath314 we have convergence in @xmath429 to a @xmath429 curve with bounded ( weak ) curvature . by the uniqueness of the limit , then , @xmath430 has bounded curvature .    bounds on ( the derivative of ) the phase of @xmath337 give corresponding bounds on ( the derivative of ) the phase of @xmath330 ( via ( [ result ! ] ) for @xmath4 and @xmath431 ) .",
    "so the phase function @xmath15 of @xmath330 is also @xmath432 convergent to the phase of @xmath433 , and satisfies the parabolic equation ( [ newdot ] ) .",
    "putting this into local coordinates and differentiating with respect to arclength @xmath434 , we get a uniformly parabolic equation with bounded coefficients and a bounded solution @xmath435 on @xmath188 $ ] . by ( @xcite section iii theorem 10.1 ) , then , @xmath435 is in fact @xmath90-hlder continuous for some @xmath426 , and @xmath436 is @xmath425 .",
    "by the existence of the flow for @xmath425 initial conditions , then , the flow exists for some time @xmath437 .",
    "working outside a fixed neighbourhood of the zeros of @xmath31 at the endpoints of @xmath92 , this follows from the bounds on @xmath441 ( [ pf ] ) coming from the @xmath442 assumption ( preserved under the flow by the maximum principle ( [ newdot ] ) ) , as the variation of @xmath443 can be made arbitrarily small with @xmath444 .",
    "since @xmath92 must stay at a bounded distance from other zeros of @xmath31 by the condition ( [ close ] ) and the maximum principle for @xmath15 ( [ newdot ] ) , we are left with proving the lemma in an arbitrarily small neighbourhood in @xmath93 of the endpoints of @xmath92 .",
    "unfortunately , in this region , the bounds we want for @xmath342 do not follow from the bounds we have for @xmath15 , and in fact come only from comparison with known solutions .",
    "draw the slags of phase @xmath445 emanating from a zero of @xmath31 , i.e. the curves in @xmath93 solving @xmath446 or @xmath447 .",
    "( since this is an ode , there is no problem in finding solutions and extending them to either infinity or another zero of @xmath31 ; see @xcite . ) in the tangent space to the zero of @xmath31 this gives a cone of angle @xmath448 which @xmath92 lies inside and can not cross either at @xmath449 or any later time in the flow .",
    "so in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of an endpoint of @xmath92 , we may bound @xmath450 inside a cone of angle less than @xmath451 , and also take @xmath443 to be within any given @xmath130 of @xmath452 ( since the zero of @xmath31 is nondegenerate ; here @xmath453 is the phase of @xmath454 at the zero of @xmath31 ) .",
    "thus @xmath443 can be bounded inside a similar cone , so that ( [ pf ] ) bounds the variation of @xmath342 by @xmath455 .",
    "the bounds on @xmath342 imply that the curve does not spiral round its endpoints but moves away from them with nonzero derivative inside the above cone until it is outside the small neighbourhood employed above .",
    "so the remaining case to consider is if the curve can pass arbitrarily close to one of its own endpoints at some bounded - below arclength from its endpoints , i.e. if the cone of slags above starting from a zero of @xmath31 passes either side of that same zero at some nonzero arclength .",
    "then there would be a slag fibred over a curve starting and ending at the same root of @xmath31 , with our lagrangian @xmath330 the connect sum of this slag and some other @xmath456 .",
    "but @xmath330 can not flow arbitrarily close to such a connect sum as its phase variation would approach at least the difference between the phase of the slag and @xmath457 , contradicting ( [ close ] ) .    by lemma [ exist ] the flow exists for all time",
    "unless , as we suppose now , the curvature of @xmath337 becomes unbounded in finite time .",
    "then to get a contradiction we start by scaling as in @xcite .",
    "pick @xmath458 such that @xmath459 tends to the blow up time and the curvature @xmath460 of @xmath461 is maximal over the curvatures of @xmath462 for all @xmath434 , and all @xmath463 ( here we parameterise by arclength @xmath434 on @xmath360 , centred at a zero @xmath464 of @xmath31 , i.e. @xmath465 lies over an endpoint of @xmath92 ) .",
    "how we handle the blow up depends on whether it happens at the branch points of @xmath337 ( i.e. the endpoints of @xmath92 ) , by which we mean @xmath466 , or in the interior @xmath467 , due to the different nature of ( [ result ! ] ) at the branch points .",
    "we first deal with the interior where the flow is a perturbation of mean curvature flow and so can be handled by @xcite :      firstly , if after passing to a subsequence of @xmath469 , and centring @xmath434 about the other branch point of @xmath337 if necessary , the blow up occurs at a finite distance @xmath470 from either branch point of @xmath337 then in this interior the flow ( [ result ! ] ) is a finite perturbation of mean curvature flow satisfying the conditions of @xcite , so a @xmath424 kink must appear in @xmath337 , contradicting lemma [ cone ] .",
    "so we need only deal with the case of @xmath471 ( by passing to a subsequence to concentrate around one of the two branch points , if necessary ) while @xmath472",
    ".    then we rescale as in @xcite ; @xmath473 where @xmath363 is the metric on @xmath360 .",
    "this rescaled flow for @xmath474 has the same form as ( [ result ! ] ) , @xmath475 but with @xmath476 and @xmath477 replaced by their pullbacks @xmath478 to the new riemannian surface ( here it is important that @xmath454 is still computed in the old coordinates , _ then _ pulled back ) .",
    "therefore their gradients are scaled by @xmath479 .",
    "@xmath365 denotes the unit normal to @xmath337 in the new metric on @xmath360 .",
    "the curvature gets scaled by @xmath479 and so has a maximum , over @xmath480 , of 1 at @xmath481 ( at time @xmath449 ) .",
    "we want to show that the two perturbation terms on the right hand side of the above flow tend to zero as @xmath482 .    in the rescaled variables , work in a geodesic disc in @xmath360 of radius @xmath483 ( @xmath484 as @xmath485 )",
    "about @xmath481 . as @xmath471 , for @xmath267",
    "sufficiently large this is within an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of @xmath464 in the original metric , in which @xmath334 varies within an angle @xmath486 cone as in the proof of lemma [ cone ] , i.e. @xmath487 varies within an angle @xmath488 cone on the double cover @xmath360 .",
    "so arclength @xmath434 on @xmath337 and radial distance @xmath153 in @xmath360 are equivalent metrics on @xmath337 in this disc ; @xmath489 and @xmath490 are both bounded .",
    "as @xmath491 is of arclength @xmath492 from @xmath464 ( the zero of @xmath31 ) at @xmath493 , we deduce that all points of our disc are of distance @xmath494 from the zero of @xmath31 ( for some constant @xmath117 fixed for all @xmath495 ) in the new metric .",
    "thus , for @xmath267 large enough , we have @xmath496 where @xmath453 is a constant just less than the norm of the derivative of @xmath497 at the zero @xmath464 in the original metric on @xmath360 ( @xmath497 pulls back to a well defined function on @xmath360 with a simple zero at @xmath464 ) .",
    "we can therefore bound @xmath498 where both sups are taken over small neighbourhoods of @xmath464 _ in the original metric on _ @xmath360 .",
    "as @xmath482 , @xmath499 , so the above bound tends to zero , while the radius of the disc we are working on @xmath500 .",

    "( we do not repeat angenent s argument here as we will give a slightly harder , @xmath4-dimensional , version of it around the endpoints of @xmath92 in lemma [ blowup ] below .",

    "we start by obtaining bounds on the polar angle of the curve and its tangent vector",

    "taking @xmath267 sufficiently large that the metric on the radius @xmath514 disc about @xmath464 in @xmath360 is sufficiently close to being flat , define geodesic polar coordinates on @xmath360 , @xmath515 ( which is @xmath516 to within a constant ) .",
    "then we can assume that @xmath517 is arbitrarily @xmath429 close to @xmath518 which is the exact formula for a flat metric and polar coordinates .",
    "this bounds @xmath519 . since by construction",
    "the curvature of @xmath337 is not more than one , i.e. @xmath520 , we can bound @xmath521 .",
    "note that ( [ sin ] ) in flat space gives us the differential equation @xmath522 for @xmath523 , with @xmath524 and @xmath525 .",

    "since we are free to make @xmath592 slightly smaller without violating the initial bounds on phase , we can ensure that there is a neighbourhood of the zero of @xmath31 , and a cone with vertex at @xmath31 whose walls @xmath92 can not cross , such that for the part of @xmath92 lying in this neighbourhood , the variation @xmath593 comparing with ( [ pf ] ) gives @xmath594 so that again no @xmath424 kinks can occur while this is less than @xmath143 , i.e. for @xmath595 .",
    "so again the analysis should be tractable in this case ( more general spiralling around a zero would make matters worse ) .",
    "however , we have not carried out the analysis necessary to show that at the moment @xmath92 reaches the zero of @xmath31 it is sufficiently smooth that the two resulting curves it splits into give @xmath509 lagrangians ( whose flow we could restart ) .",
    "+ of course by just studying the simple examples above we can not hope to know how bad the singularities are that arise in finite time in the general case .",
    "also , as mentioned in @xcite , we should perhaps restrict to those lagrangians whose floer cohomology is well defined @xcite .",
    "this includes all homology spheres , however .",
    "we should also point out the obvious fact that most of the evidence for our conjecture , other than perhaps the mirror symmetry and study of joyce s examples in @xcite , has been essentially one - dimensional ( either for @xmath6 in @xcite , or by symmetry reduction in the examples above ) .",
    "this is unrepresentative , essentially because the angles at which lagrangians intersect ( the @xmath136s of ( [ l1 ] ) ) are all the same in this situation , and so are determined by the phase ( their sum ) .",
    "so interesting phenomena , where degrees in floer cohomology change ( e.g. a hom becomes an ext@xmath596 on the mirror while the phase remains fixed ) are largely lost due to them being controlled entirely by the phase .",
