    "it is well documented that typical catalogues containing large numbers of earthquake magnitudes are closely approximated by power - law or gamma frequency distributions @xcite .",
    "this paper addresses the characterisation of counting errors ( that is , the uncertainties in histogram frequencies ) required when fitting such a distribution via the maximum likelihood method , rather than the choice of model itself ( for which see @xcite ) .",
    "we follow this with an empirical demonstration of the poisson approximation for total event - rate uncertainty ( used in * ? ? ?",
    "our analysis provides evidence to support the assumption in seismic hazard assessment that earthquakes are poisson processes @xcite , which is routinely stated yet seldom tested or used as a constraint when fitting frequency - magnitude distributions .",
    "use is made of the statistical seismology library @xcite , specifically the data downloaded from the new zealand institute of geological and nuclear sciences ( gns , http://www.gns.cri.nz ) , the southern california earthquake center ( scec , http://www.scec.org ) and the united states geological survey ( usgs , http://www.usgs.gov ) , along with associated r functions for extracting the data .",
    "consider a large sample of @xmath0 earthquakes . in order to estimate the underlying proportions of different magnitudes , which reflect physical properties of the system",
    ", the data are binned into @xmath1 magnitude ranges containing * n * events such that @xmath2 . since *",
    "n * are discrete , a gaussian model for each @xmath3 is inappropriate and may introduce significant biases in parameter estimations @xcite .",
    "hence when fitting some relationship with magnitudes * m * , * n*@xmath4*m*@xmath5 , linear regression must take the generalised , rather than least - squares , form @xcite .",
    "weighted least squares is an alternative approach which we do not consider here .",
    "n * is described as a multinomial distribution ; should we wish to test whether two different samples * n * and * n*@xmath6 are significantly different given a fixed @xmath0 `` trials '' , confidence intervals that reflect the simultaneous occurrence of all * n * must be constructed using a bayesian approach @xcite .",
    "however , in the case of earthquake catalogues , it is the temporal duration rather than the number of events that is fixed .",
    "observational variability is not , therefore , constrained to balance a higher @xmath3 at some magnitude with a lower @xmath7 elsewhere , and * n * are well approximated by independent binomial distributions @xcite .",
    "each incremental magnitude range @xmath8,@xmath9 contains a proportion of the total number of events and hence a probability @xmath10 with which any event will fall in that range . providing the overall duration of the catalogue is greater than that of any significant correlations between either magnitudes or inter - event times",
    ", @xmath3 can be modelled as a binomial experiment with @xmath0 independent trials each having a probability of `` success '' @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "the binomial distribution converges towards the poisson distribution as @xmath11 while @xmath12 remains fixed .",
    "various rules of thumb are quoted to suggest values of @xmath0 and @xmath10 for which a poisson approximation may be valid ; see for example @xcite . here ,",
    "we show empirically in sect .",
    "[ fmd ] that the frequencies in four natural earthquake catalogues are consistent with a poisson hypothesis , while in sect .",
    "[ eru ] we derive the resulting poisson distributions of the total numbers of events , which provide simple measures of uncertainty in event rates .",
    "four earthquake catalogues are analysed : new zealand ( 1460  mar 2007 ) , southern california ( jan 1932  may 2007 ) , the preliminary determination of epicentres ( pde , jan 1964  sep 2006 ) and the harvard centroid moment tensor ( cmt , jan 1977  june 1999 , @xmath13100 km focal depth ) .",
    "while we impose no additional temporal or spatial filters on the raw data , magnitude limits are chosen to minimise the effects of incompleteness at lower magnitudes and undersampling of higher magnitudes . following @xcite , who demonstrate the use of an objective bayesian information criterion for choosing between functions , we seek to fit each catalogue with either a single power - law distribution @xmath14 * m * being already on a log scale , or a gamma distribution @xmath15 where a , b , c and k are constants .",
    "the gamma distribution consists of a power law of seismic moment or energy at the lower magnitudes followed by an exponential roll - off . unlike pure power laws",
    ", its integration is finite and so it represents a physical generalisation of the gutenberg - richter law ; for examples see @xcite and references therein . for internal consistency ,",
    "the poisson assumption in @xcite is indeed valid as we now demonstrate .    as explained in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , generalised linear regression is required since we have non - gaussian counting errors on each bin . to test the consistency of these counting errors with the gaussian , binomial and poisson distributions , the residuals ( observations minus chosen fit ) are normalised to their 95% confidence intervals and plotted in fig .",
    "[ resid ] .    in all four catalogues ,",
    "the binomial and poisson residuals are almost indistinguishable , and show no significant deviation from the expected 1 in 20 exceedance rate when counting those points that lie outside the 95% confidence limits .",
    "equal bin widths @xmath16 are used as is common practice in earthquake hazard analysis ; while this underestimates the intrinsic physical uncertainty of earthquake magnitude determination , for the present purposes the poisson model appears to be a good proxy .",
    "at least , for the catalogues considered here and with @xmath16 , the poisson model is valid . by way of a further check , the value @xmath17 of the fitted power - law slope ( equs .",
    "[ eqplaw ] , [ eqgam ] ) given binomial errors is , to two significant figures , equal to that given poisson errors , for all four catalogues .",
    "constant gaussian errors systematically overestimate frequency uncertainties on the smaller magnitudes , leading to differences in @xmath17 of @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively for the southern california and pde data ( see caption of fig .  [ fits ] ) .",
    "these are caused by over - weighting the exponential components of the gamma distributions and exemplify worst - case results of incorrect error structures . in fig .",
    "[ fits ] , then , we need only plot the fits and uncertainties using the poisson model .",
    "let us now describe , in sect .",
    "[ eru ] , the usefulness of this result for estimating event - rate uncertainties .",
    "having established that independent poisson distributions characterise the magnitude frequencies in these four catalogues ( importantly , these data span sufficiently large times and distances as to minimise dependencies due to clustering ) , we now ask how this impacts on uncertainties in total numbers of events .",
    "while we can not create equivalent catalogues by re - sampling the same regions under the same physical conditions , we can simulate @xmath20 samples from each magnitude range by keeping the fitted mean @xmath21 constant ( representing the underlying reality ) and using the poisson estimate @xmath22 to capture the observational variance . summing these realisations , one per bin over all magnitudes , provides a large set of plausible alternative totals .",
    "figure  [ rates ] shows histograms of these simulated totals for each of the four catalogues , fitted with poisson distributions for reasons we now explain .",
    "it is straightforward to show analytically that the sum of independent poisson variables is itself poisson with a mean ( and hence variance ) equal to the sum of the component means @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "this result holds for ( i ) any number of independent poisson variables ( in the current context , bins ) with ( ii ) any relationship @xmath23@xmath24*m*@xmath5 , since the result is independent of @xmath25*m*@xmath5 . in the case of earthquakes placed into bins of width @xmath26 at magnitudes * m * , for example , @xmath25*m*@xmath5 is commonly fitted by a power - law or gamma distribution as in fig .",
    "[ fmd ] . from the poisson property @xmath27",
    ", it follows that @xmath28    thus we have a useful result : if there exists a physically justifiable function that provides a satisfactory fit to the histogram ( that is , poisson - distributed uncorrelated residuals as in fig .  [ resid ] ) then the mean and variance of the total number of events , over different realisations of the catalogue , are both equal to the sum of the fitted values ( eq .  [ eq4 ] ) . for the simulations of our four example catalogues ( fig .",
    "[ rates ] ) , we have mean total event numbers of @xmath29 respectively ; these match the actual observed totals to an accuracy of @xmath30 .",
    "empircal evaluations confirm @xmath31 to two significant figures , hence our estimated uncertainties on total event numbers for these catalogues are @xmath32 .",
    "since ( i ) a poisson distribution converges towards a gaussian as @xmath33 , ( ii ) a reasonable approximation to this exists where @xmath34 and @xmath35 for sample size @xmath36 @xcite , and ( iii ) we have @xmath20 with @xmath37 given above , it is not surprising that the poisson confidence intervals for @xmath38 are ( to two significant figures ) 68% as in the gaussian case .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the simplicity with which one can formally estimate event - rate uncertainties for applications in seismic hazard analysis , both in small magnitude ranges and over whole catalogues . for each of the four earthquake catalogues considered here , we find that the best estimate of both the mean and the variance of the total number of events , is equal to the total calculated from the fit to the histogram . this approximation holds where ( i ) the residuals of the fit are independently poisson distributed , and ( ii ) the overall duration of the catalogue is greater than that of any significant correlations between either magnitudes or inter - event times .",
    "note that the ratio of binomial - to - poisson variance for any frequency @xmath39 is @xmath40 , which implies that the poisson approximation provides an upper bound for the uncertainty on the total event rate should any residuals generalise to the binomial case .",
    "however , correlations between inter - event times could cause significant future changes in event rates , greater than predicted by the naive estimates of uncertainty presented here , and this is the subject of further study .",
