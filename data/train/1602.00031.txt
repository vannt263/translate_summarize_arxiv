    "the study and the exploitation of out - of - equilibrium quantum properties at micro and nanoscale , and at the level of few body systems , are becoming more and more important in pure and applied research @xcite . among the topics recently attracting a great deal of attention",
    ", a particular mention deserves the so - called branch of quantum thermodynamics @xcite . as much as its classical counterpart , indeed ,",
    "its consequences bear great theoretical , experimental and technological importance .    central topic of thermodynamics , the concept of thermal machine well represents this multidisciplinary spirit by connecting profound theoretical ideas ( such as the notions of entropy and irreversibility ) to direct applicative outcomes . in the same framework , the fast - paced development of the idea of quantum thermal machine @xcite provided in these latest years an ideal scenario to explore the possible practical implications of purely quantum features @xcite as , e.g. , quantum coherence between single quantum emitters ( hereby referred to as _",
    "atoms _ ) .    among the possible models of thermal machines available from classical contexts ,",
    "remarkable importance in quantum scenarios has been given to the so - called absorption ( or self - contained ) machines @xcite .",
    "these systems can indeed deliver thermodynamic tasks without the need of external work supplies , avoiding the problem of addressing and controlling single quantum systems .",
    "the prototype of absorption quantum thermal machine is nowadays a few - level atom interacting with a target body , on which the thermodynamic task ( refrigeration , heating up , work ) has to be delivered .",
    "two different limiting cases have so - far been explored : on the one hand , many have studied the situation in which the target body is a macroscopic system at a certain temperature @xcite , the task thus being a stationary heat flux produced by the machine from / into the target system . in this first case , despite being the setup of applicative interest , the quantum features of machine and machine - target interaction are suppressed and their role on the task becomes mostly irrelevant @xcite ; the opposite limiting case , also often studied , is the action of the machine on a single quantum system , mostly in its simplest form represented as a two - level atom ( or qubit ) @xcite .",
    "although simplified , these models allow to directly highlight the role of quantum properties ( quantum coherence , quantum discord , entanglement ) in the machine - target interaction and in the final delivery of the task .",
    "a gap thus persists in the understanding of quantum thermal machines .",
    "in particular , the questions of how the quantum properties and their role in thermodynamic tasks scale with the size of the target system , and whether they can represent a resource the machine can use to act on bigger and bigger ( quantum ) systems , remain unaddressed .     and temperature @xmath0 , embedded in a thermal blackbody radiation at temperature @xmath1 . such a field plays the role of markovian environment for a system of quantum emitters ( atoms ) , all placed at the same distance @xmath2 from the slab surface .",
    "four of these atoms are qubits , placed in a regular disposition along a circle of radius @xmath3 , the center of which is occupied by a three - level atom .",
    "the qubit system is the target body , on which the three - level machine m delivers thermodynamic tasks . for each plot of this paper",
    ", the radius is fixed at @xmath4 m , unless otherwise specified . ]",
    "this paper is a first step in filling this gap .",
    "here we study the thermodynamics of a system composed of a three - level quantum thermal machine resonantly coupled to @xmath5 identical qubits .",
    "this composite atomic system is embedded in an out - of - thermal - equilibrium ( ote ) electromagnetic field produced by macroscopic objects kept at different temperatures , analogously to the setup studied in @xcite in the case of @xmath6 .",
    "such a field naturally couples resonant transitions , allowing both the interaction of the machine with each of the qubits and the establishment of qubit - qubit correlations in the target system .",
    "thus , classical and quantum correlations are built at stationarity and their interplay fundamentally affects the thermodynamic properties of the qubits , which are studied both for an exemplary case at fixed qubits number and as a function of @xmath5 .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ physyst ] we introduce the setup of both field and atoms and describe their interaction and the consequent atomic dynamics and stationarity .",
    "the thermodynamics of the machine - target interaction is in particular analyzed in sec .",
    "[ quanttherm ] . in section [ sym_case ] ,",
    "we investigate , as an exemplary case , the thermodynamics of the system when the target body is composed of four qubits .",
    "[ scaling ] is dedicated to the scaling with the number of qubits of some interesting quantities introduced in secs .",
    "[ quanttherm ] and [ sym_case ] .",
    "final remarks and conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "finally , technical details about the atomic master equation and all the correlation quantifiers employed in the text can be found , respectively , in appendix [ rates ] and [ correlations ] .",
    "the system we consider here , as depicted in fig .  [ figure1 ] , consists of a multipartite quantum system embedded in an ote electromagnetic field .",
    "this field is produced by a macroscopic object , i.e. , a sapphire slab of thickness @xmath7 m and of resonance frequency @xmath8 rad.@xmath9 @xcite , kept at fixed temperature @xmath0 and placed in a region of space where a thermal blackbody radiation exists , emitted by some far - away walls at fixed temperature @xmath1 .    at stationarity",
    ", the non - thermal electromagnetic field filling the space between slab and walls can be precisely characterized in terms of its correlation functions @xcite . for a detailed description of its properties ,",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite . in this region of space , at a distance @xmath2 from the slab surface ,",
    "a multipartite quantum system is placed , consisting of @xmath5 identical qubits ( the target body b ) of frequency @xmath10 , placed on a circle at the center of which a three level atom ( the machine m ) lies .",
    "the circle is parallel to the slab surface , so that @xmath2 is the same for every atom .",
    "finally , the radius of the circle is referred to as @xmath3 .",
    "m has 3 allowed transitions between its three levels @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the transition between @xmath13 and @xmath12 , labeled as 2 , has the same frequency of the qubits ( @xmath14 ) , whereas the other two satisfy @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "besides , @xmath17 such that the corresponding transition @xmath18 is much more affected by the slab than the other two @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the total field+atoms system then reads @xmath19 in terms of the free emitters and field hamiltonians @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the atoms - field interaction hamiltonian @xmath22 . when expressed under the dipole - approximation limit @xcite , @xmath23 . in the absence of permanent atomic dipoles",
    ", @xmath24 is the field - induced dipole moment of the @xmath25-th transition of the atom @xmath26 which is located at @xmath27 .",
    "the electromagnetic field at this position is @xmath28 .      in the weak atom - field coupling limit and under the rotating wave approximation , a markovian master equation @xcite for the atomic density matrix @xmath29",
    "can be given @xcite under the form @xmath30+d_b(\\rho)+d_m(\\rho)+d_{\\mathrm{nl}}(\\rho),\\ ] ] where @xmath31 represents an effective hamiltonian of the atomic system , in which the dipole - dipole interaction term @xmath32 has been added to the free atomic hamiltonian , where @xmath33 is the lowering operator of the @xmath26-th qubit and @xmath34 is the lowering operator corresponding to the @xmath35-th transition of the machine m. this interaction couples only resonant transitions in the atomic system , and allows qubits and machine to coherently exchange excitations .",
    "it is worth stressing at this point that we assume that the physics of our system is robust with respect to a small dephasing , as it is the case in many analogous studies @xcite .",
    "it is important to stress here that the dipole - dipole interaction amplitudes @xmath36 and @xmath37 crucially depend , for each pair of atoms , on the mutual orientation of the two dipoles . in particular , consider a generic pair @xmath38 of atoms ( which , possibly , can also include the machine ) in a plane parallel to the slab , and let the @xmath39 axis be the direction of the line joining the two atoms .",
    "the resonant dipole - dipole interaction between these two atoms has then only components @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "all these components have both a contribution from the free field ( in the absence of the slab ) and a reflected contribution due to the scattering properties of the slab ( see eq .   and @xcite for all the technical details ) , with the only exception of the @xmath43 component , whose only contribution stems from the reflected field . as a consequence , @xmath43 interactions are weaker than the other components .",
    "it is worth stressing that the reference frame used here changes each time a new pair is chosen and must then be carefully set before starting to calculate the coefficients @xmath44 .    the terms @xmath45 and @xmath46 describe dissipative effects in the atomic dynamics , induced by the interaction with the ote field .",
    "they are @xmath47 representing the single qubit dissipative energy exchange with the field , @xmath48 being the machine - field dissipative energy exchange through the @xmath35-th machine transition and finally @xmath49 are non - local dissipative terms describing energy exchanges between the field and any two - atom pair in the open system . in these terms , the two atoms behave collectively and emit or absorb photons as a single entity .",
    "this can be shown by noting that the heat flux in / out each two - atom pair is proportional to the coherence in the reduced two - atom system , indicating that such emission / absorption processes are due to the correlations between the atoms .",
    "specifically , as we will show later on , the change in internal energy of each of the two atoms in a pair , due to such non - local dissipation , is exactly the same .",
    "note that @xmath50 and @xmath51 can be decomposed in contributions related to dipole components along the line joining the two atoms , perpendicular to it on the @xmath52 plane and perpendicular to the slab in exactly the same way as done for @xmath44 .",
    "the only non - zero contributions are also in this case @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this is a manifestation of the fact that non - local dissipation and dipole - dipole coupling are related , respectively , to the imaginary and to the real part of the electromagnetic field green function at two different points in space .",
    "all the relaxation rates @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath51 and @xmath50 and the dipole - dipole interaction strength @xmath44 depend on the frequency of the associated transition , on the ground - excited states matrix element @xmath55 of the dipole operator of the transition , on the two externally - fixed temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath56 and on the material properties of the slab .",
    "the detailed expressions for all these parameters can be found in @xcite and are given in the appendix [ rates ] .",
    "+      in what follows , we will employ different quantities describing the thermodynamics of the field+atoms system .",
    "in particular , two classes of parameters will stand out for their importance in our study : temperatures and heat fluxes .",
    "the definitions and classification we will use throughout this paper strictly follows the ones given in @xcite .",
    "the definition of heat fluxes in markovian frameworks goes through the first law for quantum systems @xcite .",
    "its form is easily given as the time variation of the mean value of their hamiltonian , which represents in quantum contexts the internal energy of a system .",
    "the same fluxes play a major role in the more delicate generalization of the second law , discussed in appendix [ app2l ] ) .",
    "given the fact that the unitary term in commutes with the hamiltonian of each atom , and thus also with the total hamiltonian of the atomic system , and there being by construction no external work in our system ( such that @xmath57 ) , the only possibility for the change in internal energy @xmath58 of an atom or a collection of atoms is given by heat fluxes .",
    "note that , seen by a subset of atoms , also the ( global ) unitary term @xmath59 $ ] can produce a change in the internal energy and in the entropy of the subset .",
    "each dissipative process @xmath60 produces a change in @xmath61 given by @xmath62 @xmath29 being the state of the atomic system at the time instant of interest .",
    "eq .   is the definition of the heat flux generated in the system with hamiltonian @xmath63 due to the dissipative process @xmath60 .",
    "temperature , on the other hand , is a tricky quantity to define in systems far from their thermodynamic limit .",
    "the best one can do is to recur to some analogy with known properties of temperature in macroscopic classical systems .",
    "the property we turn to for the characterization of our system is that a temperature gradient between two bodies imposes a direction to the heat flux between them .",
    "the ( effective ) temperature of the ote field is well defined in terms of the two real temperatures @xmath56 and @xmath0 and the slab material .",
    "the temperature of a thermal field can be inferred from the photon emission / absorption rates of an atomic transition interacting with it , independently on the transition frequency . in the case of the ote field considered here , however , different transitions naturally  feel \" different field temperature ( or , in other words , the ratio of emission to absorption rates is not simply an exponential function of the transition frequency ) .",
    "this effective environmental temperature felt by the @xmath25-th atomic transition of frequency @xmath64 can be defined as @xmath65 where the @xmath66 are the single transition dissipative rates involved in the master equation , whose explicit expression can be found in eqs .",
    "- in appendix [ rates ] .",
    "this environmental temperature describes the way the ote field exchanges heat with any two - level object having a transition frequency @xmath64 .",
    "having now at disposal both the expression of the field temperature and of the heat flux between the field and an atomic transition , one can identify an equivalent parameter describing the way the transition exchanges heat with the field .",
    "indeed , employing eq .   to calculate the local heat flux produced by the local dissipative process in either eq .",
    "( for each qubit ) or eq .",
    "( for each machine transition ) one obtains @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 having introduced the ground ( excited ) state of the @xmath25-th transition @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) . as one easily sees , @xmath72 ( hereby referred to as the population temperature ) plays here the role of temperature for atomic transition , as now @xmath73 and @xmath72 characterize the heat exchanged by the transition with the external field in a symmetric way",
    "moreover , the heat matches now the requirement to flow from the hotter into the colder object .",
    "aside of the heat exchanged locally between each atom and the field , two other fluxes affect the internal energy of atoms , stemming respectively from the atom - atom dipolar coupling @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( resonant heat flux @xmath74 ) and from the collective nonlocal dissipation in eqs .   and ( nonlocal heat flux @xmath75 ) . both of these fluxes couple only resonant atomic transitions .",
    "whereas the first flux does not change the total energy of the atomic system , representing a hopping of excitations from one atom into another one , the nonlocal flux @xmath75 implies a net flux going in / out the atomic system and being sustained by the environment : due to such nonlocal dissipation terms , the presence of an atom triggers collective emission or absorption of photons with any other atom being in resonance with it .",
    "seen from the point of view of the internal energy of each atom in the pair , this phenomena produce heat fluxes with the environment , caused by the presence of a second atom .",
    "straightforward specialization of the definition for either dipole - dipole coupling or collective dissipation for a pair @xmath38 of atoms ( possibly including the machine m ) gives @xmath76,\\label{qr}\\\\ { \\dot{q}}_d(n , m)&=&-\\hbar\\omega_\\mu\\mathrm{re}\\left[c_{nm}\\big(\\gamma_{nm}^+-(\\gamma_{nm}^-)^*\\big)\\right]\\label{qd},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the coherence in the reduced two - atom state @xmath78 , when expressed in the ordered basis @xmath79 , @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) being the ground ( excited ) state of the transition of atom @xmath26 .",
    "note that @xmath82 is the flux flowing from @xmath83 to @xmath26 , meaning that @xmath84 represents energy going out of atom @xmath83 and into atom @xmath26 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath85 has the same sign for both atoms : @xmath86 means that both @xmath26 and @xmath83 are absorbing photons from the field .    through these two heat fluxes",
    ", atoms can exchange energy and , in particular , the machine can deliver thermodynamic tasks on the target qubit system . as comes clear from eqs .   and , the thermodynamics of the machine functioning is based on the presence of quantum coherence between the machine and its target body .",
    "these energy fluxes will have the effect of changing the qubit population temperatures with respect to their corresponding environmental temperatures : eqs .   and are the main quantities we will study for our system . in particular , being @xmath73 the temperature at which each qubit would thermalize in absence of the rest of the atomic system , we will define a thermodynamic task as a stationary modification of the qubit temperature @xmath72 with respect to the corresponding value of @xmath73 .",
    "previous works on this model @xcite have shown that the machine is able to deliver different tasks when interacting with a single qubit .",
    "in particular , under certain conditions , qubit population inversion can be achieved . for this reason throughout this paper , for graphical and technical purposes",
    ", we will work with the parameter @xmath87 , which is an increasing function of @xmath88 and avoids the divergent behavior shown by the temperature in correspondence to a point of population inversion .",
    "as an exemplary case , we study the symmetric configuration represented in fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] , where four qubits are regularly distributed on a circle centered on the machine and parallel to the slab .    .",
    "every atom has the same @xmath2 .",
    "the dipole of each qubit points toward the machine , whereas the machine s one points toward qubit 1 .",
    "the interaction between two atoms depends on the projection of their dipoles along the axis joining them .",
    "for example , the qubit @xmath89 does not interact with @xmath90 but interacts with @xmath91 . ]",
    "this means that every atom has the same @xmath2 . in this case",
    ", the dipole of each qubit is pointing toward the machine ( labeled as m ) whose dipole points toward one of the qubits which we label as @xmath91 .",
    "the rest of the qubits is indexed from @xmath89 to @xmath92 in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "we begin the analysis of this system with fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] where the inverse of both environmental and population temperatures of the resonant transition of the machine , as well as the inverse of the population temperature of each qubit are plotted versus @xmath2 .",
    "since every dipole is parallel to the slab , the environmental temperature is the same for every qubit and also for the resonant transition of the machine . for small values of @xmath2 , the environmental electromagnetic field",
    "is mainly affected by the contribution of the slab .",
    "in this situation @xmath93 in then extremely close to @xmath0 . on the contrary , for very large @xmath2",
    ", the contribution of the walls to the environmental electromagnetic field is dominant , thus @xmath93 gets close to @xmath56 . for intermediate values of @xmath2 , the environmental temperature as defined through the transition rates in has intermediate values in @xmath94 $ ] .",
    "these rates depend on several parameters such as @xmath2 , @xmath0 , @xmath56 , the slab dielectric properties and its thickness ( see appendix [ rates ] ) .    due to the ote configuration",
    ", the environmental temperatures of the machine can be different from their population ones .",
    "in particular , for its resonant transition one has @xmath95 .",
    "this is due to the fact that each transition of m feels a different environmental temperature , which in turn depends on @xmath2 .",
    "thus a change in @xmath2 modifies the populations distribution of m and , as a consequence , tunes @xmath96 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",

    "notice that in the heating region , the population temperatures can reach negative values ( @xmath104 positive ) meaning that the qubits undergo population inversion . ]",
    "similarly to @xcite , where the machine is acting on a single qubit , m delivers thermodynamic tasks on qubits @xmath91 and",
    "@xmath105 . these qubits are indeed the only ones interacting both with their local environment and with the resonant transition of m. as such , they reach a steady temperature which is in between @xmath93 and @xmath96 . in particular , due to the strong coupling with the machine ( @xmath106 ) , @xmath107 will be much closer to @xmath96 than to @xmath93 .",
    "remarkably , also in this configuration m can perform strong heating or cooling : @xmath107 can indeed be brought to values outside the range @xmath94 $ ] and , in particular , to negative values ( population inversion ) .",
    "these interactions are notably due to the fact that the dipoles of m , qubit @xmath91 and qubit @xmath105 are collinear .",
    "however , the dipoles of @xmath89 and @xmath92 are orthogonal to the one of the machine , therefore m is not coupled to them . yet , as one can see in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] , qubits @xmath89 and @xmath92 undergo the same thermodynamic tasks as @xmath91 and @xmath105 .    indeed , even though there is no @xmath40 or @xmath41 interaction for the pairs @xmath108 and @xmath109 , this is not the case for @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) and @xmath112 ( @xmath113 ) , thus inducing non - zero interactions between all the qubits .",

    "a legitimate question is thus : how distinguishable is @xmath136 from a collective thermal state @xmath143 at temperature @xmath141 of the qubit system ? to answer this , we employ the quantity known as trace distance @xmath144 @xcite ( appendix [ correlations]4 ) , which tells us how statistically different the outcome of a measurement on @xmath136 is from the one of same measurement on @xmath143 .",

    "the trace distance ( i.e. the maximal distinguishing probability ) has small values , its maximum being of @xmath147 reached when @xmath146 is maximum .",

    "this means that m delivers thermodynamic tasks not only on the qubits individually , but also on the collective state of the qubits system as a whole .",
    "the tasks performed by the machine on this global state correspond quite strictly to the ones delivered on single qubits .      the functioning of the machine is based on the fact that the system is in an ote configuration , namely the temperatures of the slab and of the walls are different ( @xmath149 ) . besides , one of the main features of the machine is its aptitude to perform strong thermodynamic tasks on qubits , i.e. to bring their population temperatures outside the range defined by @xmath0 and @xmath56 .",

    "note that , at @xmath166 , the configuration is exactly the same as fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] at @xmath165 m , at which the machine is heating up the qubits the most effectively ( population inversion ) . ]",
    "this modification of qubits - machine coupling can be interpreted in terms of tripartite correlations in the atomic system . as a matter of fact",
    ", as we already pointed out in the previous section , in order for the two - step thermodynamic task to be effective on all qubits , a balance is needed between correlations in the subsystem @xmath167 and in the subsystems @xmath129 and @xmath168 .",
    "this is the case for the large @xmath155 interval @xmath156 $ ] , where the curves of @xmath169 and @xmath130 are almost superimposed .",
    "however , for @xmath170 , these two curves are no longer similar and , in particular , for small @xmath155 the qubit - qubit - qubit correlations are much stronger than the m - qubit - qubit ones .",
    "this means that one of the two steps of the task can not be accomplished anymore : the machine is less and less able to affect the qubits state due to the very strong correlations in it .",
    "a strong signature of this effect is the fact that the difference @xmath171 is maximal exactly when @xmath151 and @xmath119 are the most different , as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure6 ] .",
    "moreover , in correspondence to this point , no tripartite correlations exist involving the machine ( @xmath172 ) , suggesting that qubits and machine are fully decoupled for low - enough temperatures .",
    "notice that the existence of strong entanglement has been predicted in symmetric qubits configurations in exactly this regime of temperatures @xcite . finally , as thermal equilibrium approaches ( @xmath173 , i.e. , when @xmath174 ) , all the atomic correlations vanish and all the population temperatures ( both of machine and of qubits ) collapse on the environmental ones .",
    "the previous subsection showed the importance of machine - qubit and qubit - qubit interactions in the delivery of thermodynamic tasks in our system .",
    "it is now natural to investigate the dependence of the strength of these interactions between two atoms with respect to the distance separating them . in this subsection",

    "the external temperatures are here again fixed at @xmath179k and @xmath180k .",
    "the first and most important feature worth stressing here is the fact that , for a remarkably large range of @xmath3 , all the temperatures stay practically constant .",
    "indeed the curves show a plateau up to @xmath3 as large as @xmath181 m .",
    "in such a range , all the thermodynamics we have previously described stays unchanged .",
    "as such , our previous choice of @xmath182 m is not a limitation , as the same results would have been obtained with any other @xmath3 in @xmath183\\,\\mu$]m .",
    "therefore , the functioning of the machine is extremely robust against any uncertainty on the machine - qubits distance .",
    "after such a plateau , a very rapid drop of qubits temperatures is witnessed , together with a slight increase of @xmath151 .",
    "this marks the transition from the strong to the weak machine - qubit coupling regime .",
    "the resonant transition of the machine goes indeed to values very close to the one it would have in the absence of qubits ; the same effect can be seen in the qubits temperatures , since they rapidly reach the value of the corresponding environmental temperature , to which they would thermalize in the absence of the machine and which corresponds to the values of the temperatures minimum around @xmath184 m .",
    "finally , some temperature oscillations are seen for larger @xmath3 .",
    "these three regimes can be readily explained through the @xmath3-behavior of the machine - qubit resonant coupling @xmath185 , shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "as discussed in the appendix a ( see eq .  ) , such an interaction has two contributions , one due to the presence of the slab and one induced by the zero - temperature correlations of the field in the absence of matter .",
    "this latter is usually dominant , and an analytical expression can be given to it @xcite .",
    "this term has two clear limiting behaviors for small and for large atomic separation : when the two atoms are very close ( with respect to @xmath186 ) , the interaction has a @xmath187 dependence . on the other hand , for @xmath188",
    ", this interaction depends on @xmath3 as a sum of @xmath189 and @xmath190 terms , with a decreasing amplitude .",

    "all the quantities of this plot have been computed at @xmath165 m , such that at @xmath4 m , the configuration is precisely the same as fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] at @xmath165 m . ]    the plateau of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] is thus a consequence of the rapid growth of @xmath185 with decreasing @xmath3 : after a certain threshold , when @xmath185 becomes much greater than any other rates involved in the master equation , a saturation effect occurs and all the temperatures become independent of @xmath3 . on the other hand , for @xmath192 m , the transition between these two regimes happens , @xmath185 rapidly decreases bringing the temperatures with it and machine and qubits become almost decoupled .",
    "finally , the oscillatory regime of @xmath185 produces the residual oscillations of @xmath151 , @xmath175 and @xmath119 .",
    "this analysis provides also a way to generalize our results to different atomic frequencies : one can be sure that the qubits - machine distance is optimal for thermodynamic tasks as long as it is smaller than the critical value @xmath193 .      until now we have analyzed the changes induced in the physics of the atoms by parameters on which an external control is easily achievable .",
    "a natural problem could however arise if our results were not robust against parameters much harder to control , such as the relative positions of atoms . in preparing realistic systems , indeed ,",
    "it is not trivial to precisely fix the position of each single constituent . in this subsection",
    ", we investigate the robustness of our results against such uncertainty .",
    "to simulate such an uncertainty , we introduce a gaussian noise on the position of each atom , thus also including the machine . in order to allow for a larger variation of the atomic positions , we use here a larger radius than before , @xmath194 m , which is however still fully in the plateau zone of fig .",
    "[ figure7 ] .",
    "the position of each atom is randomly chosen according to a two - dimensional gaussian distribution , centered on the regular atomic position in fig .  [ figure2 ] and with standard deviation on both dimensions fixed at @xmath195 m .",
    "each time the position of a qubit is randomly fixed , its dipole orientation is chosen such that all the dipoles always point toward the machine .",
    "the dipole of the resonant transition of the machine , on the other hand , is always kept fixed in the same direction used in the deterministic cases previously studied .    for each value of @xmath2",
    "previously explored we have simulated 1000 random configurations and evaluated , for each of them , all the thermodynamic parameters of interest .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ figure8 ] the averaged temperatures of each qubit and of the resonant machine transition .",
    "the @xmath2-behavior of all the temperatures closely resembles the one shown previously for deterministic positions ( see fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ) , but the maximum of @xmath104 for each atom is slightly reduced .",
    "this is due to the fact that the atomic dipole - dipole coupling is statistically reduced due to the randomness in the relative dipoles orientations stemming from the stochasticity of the atomic positions .    despite this effect",
    ", one sees again that the thermodynamics of the system is very robust also against such a relatively intense random noise : all the qubits still undergo the same thermodynamic tasks as before , in correspondence to the same atoms - slab distances .    , except for the radius which has been set here to @xmath196 m .",
    "note that the difference of radius does not change anything with respect to fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] ( see fig .  [ figure7 ] ) .",

    "the dipole of each qubit points toward the machine .",
    "the dipole of @xmath90 points along the direction joining @xmath90 and the regular position of qubit @xmath91 ( similarly to fig .",
    "[ figure2 ] ) . ]",
    "finally , in this section we study the scaling of our results with the number of qubits @xmath5 , always distributing them regularly along a circle of radius @xmath182 m centered on m. we have fixed @xmath199 in all the previous sections as it represents a particularly interesting situation of a two - step task , where the role of correlations is clearer .",
    "however , as one sees in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] , similar thermodynamic effects are achieved also with different number of qubits . fig .",
    "[ figure9]a shows the scaling of the maximum in @xmath2 of @xmath104 for all the qubits and for @xmath90 ( i.e. , the maximal population inversion induced in each configuration ) , while fig .",
    "[ figure9]b shows the minimum of @xmath104 ( maximal refrigeration ) .    for both of these tasks ,",
    "two things are worth stressing .",
    "first of all , the extremal temperatures of m scale linearly with @xmath5 , suggesting that each additional qubit extracts from m or delivers into m ( directly or indirectly ) the same amount of heat as the qubits already present .",
    "second , the extremal temperatures of the qubits do not follow such a linear scaling , but rather tend to group together based on the symmetry of the qubits configuration and on the parity of @xmath5 : for even qubits numbers , the temperatures collapse to two possible values only , as happens in the case of 4 qubits discussed throughout this paper . on the contrary , for odd qubits numbers , the temperatures tend only partially to group together , there always being an isolated atom at some temperature different from the rest ( as easily visible in the case of @xmath200 and @xmath201 ) .",
    "this suggests a collective mechanism of redistribution of the heat exchanged with the machine : pairs of atoms have coupled temperatures if their position along the circle is symmetric with respect to the line joining m and qubit 1 .",
    "indeed , the couple @xmath202 is a privileged one , having always collinear dipoles independently on @xmath5 : this also explains why @xmath175 is always the closest one to @xmath151 .    since in this case",
    "the radius is constant , adding more and more atoms implies that the qubits are closer and closer to each other , thus increasing their mutual coupling : this has the effect of reducing the difference between their temperatures .",
    "thus , as indeed shown in fig .",
    "[ figure9 ] , all the qubits temperatures tend to the same value as the qubits number is increased .    .",

    "these three quantities have been maximized , for each @xmath5 , over both @xmath2 and over every possible bi- or tripartition of relevance for the related quantity : every possible bipartition in the atomic system for mi , every possible tripartition for @xmath125 and every possible bipartition of the form @xmath204 ( i.e. , with one isolated qubit ) for the quantum discord , as the analytic formula we employ in its evaluation is valid only under this condition @xcite .    the scaling behavior of the mutual information rescaled to its theoretical maximum as @xmath205 is also shown : as commented in appendix [ correlations ] , the theoretical maximal value @xmath206 of mi for a bipartition of dimension @xmath207 is @xmath208 , since mi quantifies the amount of information stored under the form of correlations between subsystems @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "since the hilbert space dimension grows as @xmath211 , more qubits allow more  memory space \" to store information .",
    "the scaling of mi provides therefore information on the interplay between the growing hilbert space dimension and the more and more diluted interactions between subparts . on the other hand , @xmath212 singles out only the @xmath5-scaling of interaction - induced correlations , by providing the relative amount of information with respect to its theoretical maximum .",
    "it is interesting to note that the scaling of @xmath212 is very similar to the scaling of the quantum discord , i.e. , of the other quantity whose values are normalized in the interval @xmath213 $ ] , independently on the hilbert space dimension .    finally , a more technical remark : despite its definition in eq .   of appendix [ correlations ]",

    "we have indeed demonstrated that thermodynamic tasks can be delivered even if the machine hilbert space is much smaller than the one of the target body , thanks to the fact that inner correlations in the target body relay and distribute the task on all its parts .",
    "this is possible thanks to a realistic and rich out - of - thermal - equilibrium configuration of a single electromagnetic field which acts as a reservoir for the machine functioning .",

    "this problem has already been encountered in previous works @xcite and tackled in the context of markovian dynamics by means of a generalization of the second law , reading @xmath281+\\frac{ds(\\rho)}{dt}\\geqslant0.\\ ] ] where @xmath282 is the total entropy ( of the open system and its environment ) , @xmath283 is the von neumann entropy of the quantum system , @xmath284 is the kernel of the @xmath25-th dissipator and @xmath25 runs over the set of dissipators .",
    "the validity of eq .   is a direct consequence of the markovian and linear structure of master equation .",
    "note that in the case of real thermal reservoirs , each @xmath284 has a gibbs form and thus we are left with the standard clausius inequality . in the case of non - thermal reservoirs such as ours , eq .",
    "allows to define a parameter playing effectively the role of temperature in entropic fluxes .",
    "this can be found by imposing , if possible , a gibbs structure to @xmath284 . in our specific case , this leads to an expression of the effective temperatures equivalent to eq .  .",
    "equation   allows to follow the total entropy production both during the system dynamics and at stationarity .",
    "figure  [ figureentropy ] reports the value of @xmath285 for the steady state of the system studied in fig .",
    "[ figure3 ] as a function of the distance from the slab .",
    "as expected , entropy is an increasing function of time for any atoms - slab distance .",
    "one could also wonder whether the heat exchanged by the emitters system with the electromagnetic field has any perceivable effects on the radiative heat transfer between the slab and the walls . using eq .",
    "( 91 ) of @xcite , one can evaluate the heat transfer between slab and wall .",
    "for an sic slab at @xmath180k in a blackbody radiation at @xmath179k , such heat transfer turns out to be @xmath286j@xmath287 .",
    "this means that , for a slab of @xmath288 , the net heat transfer from the slab to the walls would be of @xmath289j@xmath290 .",
    "employing now eq .   to evaluate all the heat exchanged by the total emitters system and its environment , one finds for @xmath291 m and",
    "@xmath292 m a total heat flux of @xmath293j@xmath294 , which is some 26 orders of magnitude smaller than the slab - walls radiative heat transfer .",
    "as such , the presence of the atomic system does not affect the energy exchanges between macroscopic objects , and in particular does not reverse the direction of radiative transfer , which still brings heat from the warmer to the colder body , in accordance with the standard macroscopic second law of thermodynamics .",
