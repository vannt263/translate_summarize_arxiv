    "we reconstruct both simulated shapes and outlines of real objects from extremely sparsely collected tomographic data : we only use 6 projection directions ( sparsely ) spanning the full 360@xmath151 . in our new method",
    "we represent the boundaries of homogeneous attenuating objects as a nurbs curve , whose control points are degrees of freedom in the inverse problem .",
    "the bayesian inversion is done by sampling the posterior distribution with an mcmc method . by referring to section [ tomographic measurement model ] ,",
    "another degree of freedom , the attenuation coefficient is set as well as our parameter of interest .",
    "the final result , in the form of the nurbs curve , is obtained by computing the conditional mean ( cm estimate ) of the chains of control points and the attenuation coefficient .",
    "our baseline method for comparison is total variation regularization followed by a thresholding step to yield a homogeneous object . to be as fair as possible to the comparison method , we chose both the regularization parameter and the binary - image threshold optimally .",
    "let us discuss the features of our bayesian inversion computation .",
    "the mcmc chains of all radii and angles seem to be mixing very well .",
    "the convergence is determined by visually looking at one- and two - dimensional chain plots and by geweke s convergence diagnostic @xcite .",
    "some of the histograms in figures [ fig : hist_r_o6r ] and [ fig : hist_theta_b6r ] are multimodal and clearly show the non - gaussian nature of the posterior distribution as a result of our nonlinear nurbs - based parametrization of the unknown .",
    "estimating the full posterior distribution by mcmc allows us to observe nonlinearities such as the multimodality of marginal distributions as shown in figure [ fig : hist_r_o6r ] , [ fig : hist_theta_b6r ] and [ fig : hist_c ] .",
    "we can quantify the uncertainty in the results as well .",
    "all of this comes in addition to getting useful reconstructions .    after computing the nurbs curve from the cm estimate of the control points ,",
    "the result is given as a binary image as an implementation of our tomographic measurement model .",
    "although in the reconstruction process we used a @xmath138 grid , the final image can be conveniently presented at higher resolution , in this case as @xmath152 grid .",
    "this is an advantage of the vector - graphic approach we use .",
    "the reconstructions of the simulated and the physical phantoms using the mcmc - nurbs approach produce comparably similar shapes and the attenuation value as the targets .",
    "the retrieval of the attenuation parameters of the proposed method for reconstructing the simulated and physical phantoms yields the relative errors of @xmath153 and @xmath154 , respectively .",
    "see table [ tab : attenuation_error ] .",
    "curiously , the histograms of attenuation value chains , shown in figure [ fig : hist_c ] , are close to gaussian distributions , in constrast to those of the control points .",
    "as always in bayesian inversion , the design of the prior distribution is crucial . in this research we spent considerable time for specifying a prior that    * is simple to write down as a mathematical formula , and * enables good enough recovery of cavities the non - convex example shapes we use .",
    "the prior we ended up using is a trade - off between several aspects : mathematical simplicity , not too many control points , and flexibility in representing non - convex shapes .",
    "for example , in figure [ fig : map ] , the reconstructions from several highest posterior are presented and depicted the change of mcmc chain . in particular , if we look closer to the upper - left of the reconstruction , some of the chain form a spiky shape .",
    "this behaviour is allowed by the prior construction which gives the flexibility of the control points to form the cavities .",
    "the spiky appearance , of course , can be removed by applying a stricter prior ( reduce the possibility of the oscillation more ) , but consequently , the control points will not form the cavities well . in the case of @xmath63 , this is how the cavities are represented : the chains of @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 , combined with @xmath159 , @xmath160 , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , form the bottom cavity .",
    "the same holds for @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath165 , and for @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath168 , in the case of the upper cavity .",
    "the prior settings allow the chain to create such cavities .",
    "a natural follow - up study would be investigating automatical choice of the number of control points .",
    "this could be based on a reversible jump mcmc strategy as in @xcite , but we do not discuss such possibilities further here .    in this sparse - data study involving 6 projections only , our proposed method is significantly better than the baseline tv method , as shown in table [ tab : shape_error1 ] and table [ tab : shape_error2 ] .",
    "clearly , even our new method still has a room for improvement as the relative errors in shape reconstruction are in the interval 3%-12% .",
    "however , such improvement must be based on using more _ a priori _ information since the measurement data is very sparse . in this study",
    "we do not want to impose more or stricter prior information in the fear of over - fitting our model . in a practical application one might have better and more accurate _ a priori _ information about the target , which could then be used for lowering the reconstruction error further .",
    "there are several interesting avenues for further investigation .",
    "namely , mcmc - nurbs tomography can be used for imaging corrosion inside pipelines ; in that case the inner boundary of the pipeline is represented as a nurbs curve .",
    "also , one can extend the new method to targets comprising several components . in that case",
    "the mcmc algorithm can have random `` birth '' and `` death '' events varying the number of components .",
    "see @xcite for such a study involving cracks in electrical conductivity .",
    "our nurbs - based nonlinear bayesian inversion performs very well in the tomographic task of recovering homogeneous 2d objects from extremely sparse projection data . by using advanced mcmc techniques",
    ", we have shown that the mcmc approach is computationally feasible . to tackle the heavy computation , further speed - up strategies are available , such as parallellization , improving the choice of initial value and optimizing the covariances of the sampling strategy .",
    "the results are conveniently in cad - compatible vector - graphic format .",
    "quantitative comparison to the baseline method , optimally thresholded tv regularization , is favorable to our method . in the case of recovering the attenuation value",
    ", nurbs - mcmc delivers results with relative errors one order of magnitude smaller that the baseline method .",
