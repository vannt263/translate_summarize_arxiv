    "for example , the tight correlation between star formation rate ( sfr ) and stellar mass in uv-/optically selected star forming galaxies is indicative of buildup by continuous gas inflow @xcite . as part of the sins survey ( @xcite ; n.  m.  frster schreiber et al .",
    "2008 in preparation ) , integral field spectroscopy of more than @xmath2 uv-/optically selected @xmath0 star forming galaxies show a preponderance of thick gas - rich rotating disks and only a minority of major mergers @xcite . in contrast , smgs are probably short - lived maximum - starburst galaxies undergoing dissipative major mergers @xcite .",

    "how do these observations fit into the concordance cosmological model ?",
    "modern simulations of dark matter structure formation are robust and fixed by the cosmological parameters .",

    "galaxies at @xmath0 differ significantly from local galaxies .",
    "the central mass densities of smgs and of massive quiescent galaxies at the same redshift ( @xcite and references therein ) are an order of magnitude greater than those of local spheroids and disks @xcite . also , the @xmath0 rotating disks are thick and turbulent , unlike local disk galaxies .",
    "these differences raise the question : what are the local universe descendants of these @xmath0 galaxies ?    in this paper we use the cosmological dark matter millennium simulation ( @xcite ;  [ s : find_merger ] ) to investigate the possible role of major mergers in galaxy formation at @xmath0 (  [ s : z_2 ] ) , and to consider the evolution of the @xmath0 galaxies to @xmath1 (  [ s : evolution ] ) .",

    "the millennium simulation is a cosmological n - body simulation .",

    "structures are identified in two steps .",
    "first , the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm @xcite creates a catalogue of fof groups at each snapshot .",
    "the fof groups represent dark matter halos .",
    "second , bound substructures are identified inside the fof groups ( subfind ; @xcite ) , so that each halo contains at least one subhalo . the millennium merger trees are constructed by finding a single descendant for each _ subhalo _ in the following snapshot , while the fof groups themselves play no role in constructing the merger trees .    in traditional merger trees , mergers are instantaneous , i.e. there is no information on their durations .",
    "therefore , the millennium public merger trees can be used to determine the merger rate , which is merely a count of the number of mergers per unit time ( @xcite , s.  genel et al .",
    "2008 in preparation ) .",
    "however , they can not be used to determine important quantities such as the major merger fraction , defined as the fraction of halos undergoing major mergers at a given time , or the mass growth rate of each halo .      to derive merger fractions and mass growth rates",
    ", we must consider the finite physical durations of mergers .",
    "therefore , start and end points must be defined .",
    "also , to derive these quantities for entire dark matter halos rather than for subhalos , new trees have to be constructed based on fof groups . in our procedure",
    ", the main subhalo in each fof group is identified and is then followed to its subhalo descendant , using the original subhalo - based trees .",
    "the fof group to which the subhalo descendant belongs is defined as the fof group descendant of the original fof group .",
    "thus , in our new trees each node is an entire fof group , rather than a subhalo . if two subhalos merge while within a single fof group we do not count this as a merger event .",
    "we identify a merger whenever two or more fof groups at snapshot @xmath15 have a common descendant at snapshot @xmath16 .",
    "however , at this time the halos are not necessarily already physically merging , since they may still be well separated . to account for that , we track the distances between the subhalo descendants of the main subhalos of the original fof groups .",
    "these subhalos represent , approximately , the centers of the entire halos .",
    "we then define the start point of the merger as the last snapshot at which this distance is still larger than the sum of the virial radii of the original halos ( fof groups ) . in some mergers",
    "the subhalos disappear before the distances become smaller than the sum of the original virial radii .",
    "when this happens the start point is defined as just one snapshot prior to the point where the subhalos merge and/or disappear .",
    "after a merger begins , one of the halos becomes a substructure within the other .",
    "this substructure typically dissolves too quickly to be followed until the merger is physically complete . to overcome this problem we first estimate the duration of mergers @xmath17 , and define their end point as @xmath17 after the start point . to estimate the durations , we considered the fitting functions of @xcite and @xcite , which are based on simulations of mergers .",
    "our results are qualitatively robust with respect to this choice .",
    "we present quantitative results based on the orbit - averaged @xcite fitting function for the dynamical friction merger time : @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mass ratio and @xmath20 is the hubble constant at redshift @xmath21 .",
    "the accretion rate we associate with each merger equals the amount of accreted mass divided by the merger duration @xmath17 .",
    "to summarise , we construct new fof group - based merger trees , where each fof group also holds information about internal on - going mergers .",
    "the accretion rates associated with those mergers are summed up to obtain the total accretion rate onto the fof group in question .",
    "the merger mass ratio is determined by the masses of the fof groups at snapshot @xmath15 , just prior to the appearance of a common fof group descendant at snapshot @xmath16 .",
    "we define major mergers as those with mass ratios between @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( with @xmath23 being the most `` intense '' type of merger ) .",

    "the @xmath35 scatter equals @xmath36 , which reflects more the upwards scatter , although negative accretion rates do exist for some halos ( because of tidal stripping or fluctuations related to the fof algorithm ) .",
    "our numerical results are in good agreement with the analytic approximation for the accretion rate presented by @xcite , which is based on the extended press - schechter ( eps ) model @xcite .",
    "the @xcite approximation has a somewhat stronger mass and redshift dependence compared to our results .",
    "for example , at @xmath1 and @xmath37 , their accretion rate is @xmath38 higher , and at @xmath39 and @xmath40 it is a factor of @xmath41 higher . for halos of particular interest for this paper , i.e.  of @xmath42 at @xmath0 , the @xcite approximation exceeds our eq .",

[ e : sfr_dar ] is a plausible measure of the baryonic accretion rate . at larger masses",
    "the accretion rate is lower and is controlled by the cooling time in the hot virialised baryonic halo gas . at much smaller masses it is strongly reduced by outflows generated by supernovae feedback . in the cold flow regime , the cold gas ( which may be clumpy ) is fed at approximately virial velocity via filaments directly into the halo center , where it accumulates onto the galaxy . moreover , considering the case where gas is stripped off incoming galaxies , our estimated merger duration is related to the dynamical time of the halo , on which the gas will fall to the central galaxy when the cooling time is short . for major mergers",
    "@xmath47 may even exceed @xmath50 , because the star formation burst they trigger can be shorter than the dark matter halo merger time scale ( e.g.  @xcite ) .      on fig .",

    "furthermore , for @xmath51 the expected mass accretion rates are sufficient to account for the observed sfrs . also , the predicted major merger fraction is small ( @xmath52 ) , consistent with observations .",
    "although the statistics are still small , we notice that the confirmed sins mergers ( @xcite ; _ stars _ ) have higher specific dark matter accretion rates than the confirmed disks ( _ open circles _ ) , and therefore come from a region where the halo major merger fraction is higher .",

    "also , some of the halos in this mass range may have already developed virial shocks that quench star formation .     at @xmath55 ( corresponding to the halo mass and redshift of bzk-15504 ) , which are not undergoing a major merger .",

    "this is very similar to the `` observable '' galaxy merger timescale often found in the literature ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the approximation taken here , i.e.  considering directly the halo merger fraction and inferring the galaxy merger fraction from it , is probably a reasonable one with respect to the deduced merger fraction of the sins galaxies .",
