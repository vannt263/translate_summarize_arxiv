    "many tomographic imaging modalities are based on the inversion of radon transforms , which map a function onto its integrals over certain surfaces in @xmath1 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the most basic example is the classical radon transform which maps the function onto its integrals over hyperplanes and which is the mathematical basis of x - ray ct .",
    "another well investigated example is the spherical radon transform , which maps a function onto its integrals over hyper - spheres and which finds application in the recently developed photoacoustic tomography @xcite . in this article",
    "we consider the conical radon transform that maps a function to its integrals over circular half cones .",
    "the conical radon transform recently gained increased interest , mainly due to its relevance for spect using compton cameras ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "single - photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) is a well established medical imaging technology for functional imaging . in spect , weakly radioactive tracers are given to patient and participate in the physiological processes .",
    "the radioactive tracers can be detected through the emission of gamma ray photons which provide information about the interior of patient . in order to obtain location information on the emitted photons ,",
    "the standard approach in spect uses collimators which only record photons that enter the detector vertically .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : spect](a ) , such data provide values of line integrals of the tracer distribution .",
    "a major drawback of using collimators is that they remove most photons .",
    "therefore the number of recorded photons is low and the noise level high .",
    "typically , only one out of @xmath2 photons emitted from the patient is actually detected with this standard approach . in order to increase the number of recorded photons , the concept of compton cameras has been developed in  @xcite .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : spect](b ) , a compton camera consists of a scatter detector array d1 and an absorption detector array d2 .",
    "a photon emitted in the direction of the camera undergoes compton scattering in d1 , and is absorbed in d2 .",
    "the required distinction of individual photons is obtained by coincidence detection .",
    "both detectors are position and energy sensitive , and the measured energies can be used to determine the scattering angle @xcite . using such information ,",
    "one concludes that the detected photon must have been emitted on the surface of a circular cone , where the vertex is given by the position at d1 , the central axis points from the position on d2 to the position on d1 , and the opening angle equals the compton scattering angle .",
    "consequently , for a distribution of tracers , the compton camera approximately provides integrals of the marker distribution over conical surfaces .",
    "as outlined above , spect with compton cameras yields to the conical radon transform that maps a function @xmath3 modeling the marker distribution to the surface integrals @xmath4 over right circular half cones @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the vertex of the cone , @xmath7 the direction of the central axis , and @xmath8 the half opening angle . variants of the conical radon transform in @xmath9 are known as v - line or broken - ray transforms .",
    "these transforms appear in emission tomography with one - dimensional compton cameras @xcite , or in the recently developed single scattering optical tomography  @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we consider the conical radon transform in general dimension and further include a radial weight , that can be adjusted to a particular application at hand . in previous work on compton camera imaging  @xcite , models with and without radial weight",
    "have been proposed and used .",
    "the conical radon transform depends on six parameters @xmath10 , whereas the function @xmath11 only depends on three spatial coordinates .",
    "therefore the problem of reconstructing @xmath12 from its integrals over all circular cones is highly overdetermined .",
    "several authors have studied the problem of inverting the function from integrals over particular subsets of all cones . in spect with compton cameras ,",
    "the vertex is naturally fixed to the scattering surface d1 . in the case where d1 is a plane and the axis",
    "is fixed to @xmath13 , fourier reconstruction formulas have been derived in @xcite .",
    "formulas of the filtered backprojection type have been derived in @xcite .",
    "the case of variable axis and vertices restricted to a surface has been considered in @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for related results on different conical transforms .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "if the set of vertices is different from a plane and any vertex is associated with a single symmetry axis , no results are known for reconstructing a function from its integrals over such cones . in this paper",
    "we develop an inversion approach for the case when @xmath14 is a sphere and the symmetry axes of the cones are orthogonal to the sphere . we derive a reconstruction procedure based on spherical harmonics decomposition and show invertibility of the considered transform .",
    "spherical harmonics decompositions have been previously used for studying other radon transforms .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for the classical radon transform , @xcite for a weighted radon transform over planes , @xcite for the circular radon transform , or @xcite for a broken ray transform with vertices in a disc . in these works ,",
    "the arising generalized abel equations satisfy all conditions needed in order to apply standard well - posedness results . for the transform we study , one basic assumption of these results",
    "is violated , namely the kernels turn out to have zeros on the diagonal ( see theorem [ thm : glk2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , we are able to show solution uniqueness ; see theorem  [ thm : uni ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : crt ] we define the conical radon transform with vertices on the sphere and orthogonal axis , and derive some elementary results for that transform .",
    "our main results are stated in section  [ sec : main ] . by using expansions in spherical harmonics ,",
    "we are able the reduce the conical radon transform to a set of explicitly given one - dimensional integral equations of the abel type ( see theorem  [ thm : glk2 ] ) .",
    "the invertibility of the one dimensional integral operators will be given in theorem  [ thm : uni ] .",
    "for that purpose , in appendix  [ app : abel ] we derive uniqueness results for first kind volterra equations ( theorem  [ thm : volterra2 ] ) and generalized abel equations with kernels having zeros on the diagonal ( theorem  [ thm : abel ] ) .",
    "theorem  [ thm : uni ] in particular implies injectivity of the considered transform and additionally yields an efficient inversion method . in section  [ sec : num ] , we develop such a reconstruction procedure based on our theoretical findings and present some numerical results .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we present a short summary and discuss possible lines of future research .",
