    "in 1987 d. gabai introduced the concept of _ thin position _ for knots @xcite to solve the property @xmath2 conjecture . since then it has been used to solve many important questions in 3-manifold topology @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "a. thompson shows that if the exterior of a knot or link @xmath3 does not contain any planar , meridional , essential surfaces then thin position for @xmath3 has no thin levels .",
    "the idea of the proof is to show that the property of being _ non - trivial _ , possessed by a thin level , can not disappear after any number of compressions .",
    "therefore , compressing any thin level as much as possible yields a planar , meridional , essential surface .    in this paper",
    "we show that the property of being _ non - parallel _ , possessed by a collection of thin levels , can not disappear after any number of compressions ( as long as the compressions are chosen in a suitably nice way ) .",
