    ", both amplitudes have imaginary parts , since for this case @xmath211 gev , and can be produced on - shell in the decay of @xmath0 . to obtain an exact cancellation between the @xmath78 and @xmath5 amplitudes in this case ,",
    "it is necessary that the ratio of the real parts of @xmath108 and @xmath106 be equal to the ratio of their imaginary parts .",
    "it can be shown that this is not possible to achieve , and that is the reason why we do not find smaller values of @xmath169 .    in fig .",
    "[ eta ] we show different regions in the plane formed by the @xmath105 coupling @xmath118 , normalized by @xmath212 , and the charged higgs mass @xmath119 , for two values of @xmath213 .",
    "the regions are defined by the parameter @xmath169 in the following way : i ) for a given value of @xmath12 , @xmath196 calculated in _ benchmark a _ is within @xmath214 of the branching ratio calculated in _",
    "benchmark f _ ; ii ) the deviation is between @xmath214 and @xmath185 ; iii ) the deviation is larger than @xmath185 .",
    "the dividing lines are not absolute , since there is some small overlap between regions .",
    "as expected , larger corrections are obtained for larger values of the coupling @xmath118 .",
    "similarly , larger corrections are obtained for smaller charged higgs masses .",
    "this behaviour can be understood from eq .",
    "( [ trilinear_coup1 ] ) , where we see that for fixed @xmath118 , @xmath104 is inversely proportional to @xmath215 .",
    "the effect of @xmath75 can also be observed from the figure .",
    "the general shape of the regions is unchanged , and the observable effect is a re - scaling of the coupling @xmath118 .",
    "this is clearly understood from eq .",
    "( [ trilinear_coup2 ] ) , where we see that both couplings @xmath118 and @xmath216 are scaled by a factor @xmath203 .",
    "note that the sign of the coupling @xmath118 directly determines whether the charged higgs contribution adds constructively ( @xmath167 ) or destructively ( @xmath168 ) to the @xmath78 contribution . in eq .",
    "( [ trilinear_coup2 ] ) this coupling is written as a function of @xmath119 , @xmath73 , @xmath208 , @xmath217 , and @xmath75 .",
    "the charged higgs mass @xmath119 and @xmath208 always contribute positively to @xmath118 . on the contrary , the cp - odd higgs mass @xmath73 contributes negatively , while the @xmath217 contribution does not have a definite sign .",
    "as stressed in section 4.2 , observation of @xmath3 at the lhc with a sizeable event number would provide information on the magnitude of @xmath169 , which in turn would constrain the above higgs potential parameters in the context of the 2hdm ( type i ) .",
    "at the lhc , with @xmath218 per experiment , the expected accuracy for the branching ratio @xmath219 varies between @xmath220 and @xmath221 , within the mass region sensitive to the lhc , @xmath222 gev @xcite . considering that this study was done based on the @xmath223 production mechanism",
    ", it does not directly apply to our fermiophobic higgs .",
    "this is because the relevant production mechanisms for @xmath0 at the lhc are higgsstrahlung and weak vector boson fusion , and a dedicated study would be needed .",
    "nevertheless , it is encouraging that the corrections we find are easily larger than the quoted sensitivity .",
    "even better precision for @xmath219 can be achieved at the ilc , being @xmath224 for @xmath225 gev , and improvable to @xmath185 with initial state polarization @xcite , with higgsstrahlung @xmath226 production mechanism , , applicable to a fermiophobic higgs .",
    "finally , the photon - photon option for the ilc can achieve a @xmath227 and @xmath228 sensitivity for the modes @xmath229 and @xmath230 , respectively @xcite , which are also applicable to our fermiophobic higgs @xmath0 .",
    "the lhc has impressive sensitivity to fermiophobic higgs bosons ( @xmath0 ) decaying to two photons with a large ( @xmath231 ) branching ratio .",
    "observation of this photonic decay mode ( @xmath232 ) with a rate significantly above that expected for the standard model higgs boson could be accommodated in the fermiophobic limit of the 2hdm ( type i ) . in a commonly used benchmark model the decay @xmath232",
    "is assumed to be mediated solely by loops involving @xmath4 , although potentially large contributions may arise from charged scalar loops . in the mass region",
    "sensitive to the lhc @xmath233 gev ) we showed that such contributions can cause large suppressions , @xmath202 ( @xmath201 correction ) or moderate enhancements , @xmath200 ( @xmath199 correction ) of the branching ratio for @xmath232 .",
    "these corrections should be compared with expected sensitivities in the measurement of the photon - photon branching ratio of the higgs , which vary from @xmath221 at the lhc to @xmath227 at the photon - photon option of the ilc .",
    "consequently , interpretation in the 2hdm ( type i ) of any signal for @xmath0 at the lhc and ilc would necessitate inclusion of the scalar loops .",
    "this in turn would provide information on the parameters of the scalar potential , through the charged higgs mass and the @xmath105 coupling , which in the fermiophobic limit was shown to diminish with increasing @xmath75 , as does @xmath234 .",
