    "the high center - of - mass energy ( @xmath5 ) of the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) opens up the hard scattering regime , which is accessed by measuring particle production at high transverse momentum @xmath0 .",
    "the high-@xmath0  particles ( @xmath10 ) originate from the fragmentation of partons that have scattered in the early stage of the collisions .",
    "hence , in heavy - ion collisions the high-@xmath0  particles can be used to probe the produced medium of strongly interacting matter .",
    "a significant suppression of high-@xmath0  hadron production relative to a simple binary collision scaling from @xmath3  has been observed at rhic  in central @xmath11  collisions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was found that jet - like correlations opposite to trigger jets are suppressed , and that the azimuthal anisotropy in hadron emission persists out to very high @xmath0  @xcite . in contrast , no suppression effects were seen in @xmath4  collisions  @xcite , which has led to the conclusion that the observations made in @xmath11  are due to the high - density medium produced in such collisions and not to initial state effects .",
    "the most probable explanation to date is that the suppression is due to parton energy loss from induced gluon radiation ( jet quenching ) in the extremely hot and dense medium  @xcite . to quantitatively understand this behavior and , in particular , to separate hot from cold nuclear matter effects , such as cronin effect  @xcite and parton shadowing and antishadowing  @xcite",
    ", precise measurements of identified hadrons at high @xmath0  in @xmath3  and @xmath4  collisions are required  @xcite .",
    "prompt photons have long been proposed as a powerful tool for studying the jet quenching via photon - jet correlations  @xcite . in the dominant hard photon production processes ( quark - gluon compton scattering and quark - antiquark annihilation ) , the outgoing photon balances the momentum of its partner parton and has large enough mean free path to escape the collision system , providing a calibrated probe for studying the energy loss and mean free path of the parton in the medium .",
    "in addition , prompt photons constitute a background for measuring the medium - induced production of photons in response to the energy deposited by that parton  @xcite .",
    "the thermal photon spectrum is directly related to the temperature of the hot and dense medium created in the heavy - ion collision , provided that it is in thermal equilibrium  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of such a spectrum requires a knowledge of the prompt photon background , which can be measured in @xmath3  and @xmath4  systems that share multiple sources of photons with heavy - ion collisions but are not expected to produce an extended thermal system .",
    "the measurements of @xmath1 s and direct photons in @xmath3  collisions are also of specific interest for studies of the proton spin structure ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which are underway at rhic . a main objective of the rhic  spin program is to constrain the polarization of the gluons inside the proton [ @xmath12 .",
    "the unpolarized cross sections provide a test of the next - to - leading order perturbative qcd  ( nlo  pqcd ) framework , which is used to interpret the measured spin - dependent observables .    in this paper , we present the first results for the high-@xmath0  @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and direct photon production in @xmath3  and @xmath4  collisions at @xmath5 in the pseudorapidity range @xmath6 , measured by the star  experiment at rhic   ( except the cross section for @xmath1  production in @xmath3  collisions , first presented in ref .",
    "the star  barrel electromagnetic calorimeter was used to detect high-@xmath0  @xmath1  and @xmath2  mesons via their @xmath13 decays .",
    "the direct photon signal was extracted statistically by subtracting the @xmath1@xmath14 , @xmath2 , and @xmath9(782 ) decay background from the inclusive photon distribution observed in the calorimeter .",
    "the presented data constitute a necessary baseline for the measurements of @xmath1@xmath14 , @xmath2 , and direct photon production in heavy - ion collisions at rhic .",
    "inclusive @xmath1  production was previously measured in star  for low @xmath0  at midrapidity in @xmath11  collisions at @xmath15  @xcite and @xmath16  @xcite , and at the forward rapidities in @xmath3  and @xmath4  collisions at @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "star  has also measured the production of other identified particles , such as @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20/@xmath21 , and hadronic resonances  @xcite .",
    "the phenix  experiment at rhic  has also measured the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and direct photon production at @xmath5 in a variety of collision systems , including @xmath3  and @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section_experiment ]",
    ", we describe the detectors that were used in this analysis . in section  [ section_data_reconstruction ]",
    ", we describe the data processing chain used to reconstruct photon candidates in the raw data .",
    "sections  [ section_pizero_analysis ] and  [ sec_direct_photons ] show how these photon candidates were used to calculate the yields of @xmath1  and @xmath2 , and direct photons , respectively .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec_results ] , we present the results and compare our data to the theoretical calculations and to the measurements by other experiments .",
    "the star  detector ( solenoidal tracker at rhic )  @xcite was designed primarily for measurements of hadron production in heavy - ion and proton - proton collisions over a large solid angle . for this purpose",
    ", tracking detectors with large acceptance and high granularity were placed inside a large - volume solenoidal magnetic field ( 0.5@xmath22 ) .",
    "the detector subsystems relevant for the present analysis are briefly described in the following sections .      the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite is the central tracking device in star .",
    "it allows one to track charged particles , measure their momenta , and identify the particle species by measuring the ionization energy loss @xmath23 .    the tpc  barrel measures @xmath24 in length , and has an inner radius of @xmath25 and an outer radius of @xmath26 .",
    "the tpc  acceptance covers @xmath27 units in pseudorapidity and full azimuth .",
    "particle momentum is measured in the range @xmath28@xmath29 . in this analysis ,",
    "tpc  tracks were used to reconstruct the interaction vertex and to identify the energy deposits of charged particles in the calorimeter .",
    "two forward time projection chambers ( ftpc )  @xcite extend the star  tracking capability to the pseudorapidity range @xmath30 .",
    "each ftpc  is a cylindrical volume with a diameter of @xmath31 and a length of @xmath32 , with radial drift field and pad readout chambers mounted on the outer cylindrical surface .",
    "two such detectors were installed partially inside the main tpc , on both sides of the interaction point . in this analysis ,",
    "the forward charged - track multiplicity recorded in the ftpc  in the gold beam direction served as a measure of the centrality in @xmath4  collisions .",
    "a barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc )  @xcite was incrementally added to the star  setup in 20012005 to measure the energy deposited by high-@xmath0  photons and electrons and to provide a trigger signal .",
    "the calorimeter is located inside the magnet coil and surrounds the tpc , covering a pseudorapidity range @xmath33 and full azimuth .",
    "the full calorimeter consists of two contiguous half@xmath34-barrels , located east and west of the nominal interaction point , each of which is azimuthally segmented into @xmath35 modules .",
    "each module is approximately @xmath36 wide and covers @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) in azimuth and one unit in pseudorapidity .",
    "the active depth is @xmath39 , to which @xmath40 of structural elements are added at the outer radius .",
    "results presented in this paper used only the west calorimeter half@xmath34-barrel ( @xmath6 ) , which was fully installed and calibrated in 20032005 .",
    "the modules are segmented into @xmath41 projective towers of lead - scintillator stacks , @xmath42 in @xmath43  and @xmath44 in @xmath2  direction .",
    "a tower covers @xmath45 in @xmath46 and @xmath47 units in @xmath48 .",
    "each calorimeter half@xmath34-barrel is thus segmented into a total of @xmath49 towers .",
    "each tower consists of a stack of @xmath44 layers of lead and @xmath50 layers of scintillator .",
    "all these layers are @xmath51 thick , except the first two scintillator layers , which are @xmath52 thick .",
    "a separate readout of these two layers provides the calorimeter preshower signal , which was not used in this analysis . a shower maximum detector ( see below ) is positioned behind the fifth scintillator layer .",
    "the whole stack is held together by mechanical compression and friction between layers . from layer - by - layer tests of the bemc  optical system , together with an analysis of cosmic ray and beam test data , the nominal energy resolution of the calorimeter is estimated to be @xmath53@xmath54 = @xmath554@xmath53%@xmath56",
    "@xmath57 1.5@xmath53%  @xcite .",
    "the shower maximum detector ( smd ) is a multi@xmath58-@xmath59wire proportional counter with strip readout .",
    "it is located at a depth of approximately @xmath60 radiation lengths at @xmath61 , increasing to @xmath62 radiation lengths at @xmath63 , including all material immediately in front of the calorimeter .",
    "the purpose of the smd  is to improve the spatial resolution of the calorimeter and to measure the shower profile .",
    "this is necessary because the transverse dimension of each tower ( @xmath64 ) is much larger than the lateral spread of an electromagnetic shower .",
    "the improved resolution is essential to separate the two photon showers originating from the decay of high - momentum @xmath1  and @xmath2  mesons .",
    "independent cathode planes with strips along @xmath2  and @xmath43  directions allow the reconstruction of two projections of a shower .",
    "the coverage is @xmath65 for the @xmath2-strips and @xmath66 for the @xmath43-strips , each group of @xmath67 towers covers @xmath68 strips in each smd  plane behind it . in total , smd  contains @xmath69 strips .",
    "in addition to the star  barrel detectors , sampling hadronic calorimeters were placed at a distance of @xmath70 from the interaction point , on both sides of the experimental hall . in heavy - ion collisions , these zero degree calorimeters ( zdc )  @xcite measure the total energy of the unbound neutrons emitted from the nuclear fragments after a collision .",
    "the charged fragments of the collision are bent away by the rhic  dipole magnets upstream of the zdcs . for the @xmath4  data used in this analysis ,",
    "the zdc  provided a collision trigger by requiring the detection of at least one neutron in the gold beam  direction .    to provide a collision trigger in @xmath3  collisions , beam - beam counters ( bbc )  @xcite were mounted around the beam pipe beyond both poletips of the star  magnet at a distance of @xmath71 from the interaction point .",
    "the detector consists of two sets of small and large hexagonal scintillator tiles arranged into a ring that covers pseudorapidities between @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "the minimum bias trigger required a coincidence of signals in at least one of the @xmath74 small bbc  tiles on each side of the interaction region .",
    "the two bbc  counters record timing signals that can be used to determine the time of flight for the forward fragments .",
    "the difference between these two flight times provides a measurement of the @xmath75  position of the interaction vertex ( @xmath76 ) to an accuracy of about @xmath77  @xcite .",
    "events with large values of the time - of - flight difference , which indicate the passage of beam background , were rejected at the trigger level .",
    "the bbcs  also served to measure the beam luminosity in @xmath3  runs .",
    "the data used in this analysis were taken in the @xmath4  run of 2003  and in the @xmath3  run of 2005 , both at @xmath17 .",

    "_ _ hightower trigger__@xmath80 + this condition required a transverse energy deposit @xmath85  above a predefined threshold in at least one calorimeter tower , in addition to satisfying the minbias condition .",
    "this trigger enriched the recorded dataset with events that had a large @xmath85 .",
    "two different thresholds were applied , defining the hightower-@xmath861  and hightower-@xmath872  datasets .",
    "the nominal values of these thresholds were set to @xmath88 and @xmath89 in @xmath3 , and to @xmath90 and @xmath91 in @xmath4  runs .",
    "prior to each run , all towers were equalized to give the uniform transverse energy response , by adjusting the high - voltage settings of the individual photomultipliers .    _ hightower software filter _ + the hightower - triggered data were additionally filtered using a software implementation of the hightower trigger . in this filter , the highest tower adc  value found in the event was required to exceed the same hightower-@xmath861  ( hightower-@xmath872 ) threshold as the one that was used during the run .",
    "this filter was needed to remove events that were falsely triggered due to the presence of noisy channels ( hot towers ) .",
    "such channels were identified offline in a separate analysis and recorded in a database .",
    "in addition , the highest calibrated transverse energy of a tower in the event was required to exceed slightly higher thresholds ( @xmath92 ) than those used during the run , to account for possible inaccuracy of the online calibration of the towers .",
    "this software filter also served to make the trigger efficiency for the monte carlo detector simulation and for the real data as close as possible .      during the data taking in 20032005 , interactions of beam ions with material approximately @xmath93 upstream from the interaction region gave rise to particles that traversed the detector almost parallel to the beam direction .",
    "this source of background was eliminated by installing additional shielding in the rhic  tunnel for the subsequent runs .    to identify events containing such background tracks ,",
    "the ratio @xmath94 was calculated , where @xmath95 is the total transverse energy recorded in the bemc  and @xmath96 is the transverse momentum sum of all charged tracks reconstructed in the tpc . in events containing background , @xmath97  was large ( close to 1 ) because photons from these background events deposited a large amount of energy in the calorimeter , while the accompanying charged tracks were not reconstructed in the tpc , because they did not point to the vertex .",
