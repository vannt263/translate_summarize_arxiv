    "when @xmath70 , @xmath42 and @xmath5 state appear for both side of the superconductors near the interface .",
    "the existence of the @xmath5-wave is same reason as the ordinary discussion for @xmath5-wave state at the edge of the @xmath1-wave superconductor on @xmath4 ( 110-junction ) .",
    "next , we show the @xmath65 case .",
    "the phase factor is @xmath71 , so 110-junction is same as in the 100-junction ( @xmath72 )",
    ". therefore real part of the @xmath1-wave is not spacial dependence in the @xmath60 case , @xmath3 pair potential is constance for all region .",
    "@xmath42 and @xmath5-wave do nt appear and @xmath73-wave does nt appear too .    when @xmath68 , since existence of the barrier potential makes the reflection of the quasi - particle at the interface , @xmath1-wave factors are reduced .",
    "@xmath70 case is same as @xmath68 .",
    "the different point at the @xmath70 is the existence of the @xmath5 state at the interface .",
    "finally , we show the normalized dc josephson current for 110-junction and 100-junction . for 110-junction ,",
    "josephson current is suppressed at the @xmath74 region for @xmath70 , and it suppressed at all area for @xmath68 . for @xmath75 , josephson current behaves @xmath76 .",
    "on the other hand , for 100-junction , josephson current is not suppressed . and",

    "in this section , we summarize the obtained results .",
    "now we have seen the imaginary part of the pair potential exists at the @xmath77 , @xmath78 for 110-junction .",
    "that occurs by the existence of the macroscopic phase of the superconductors .",
    "this results are different from the situation of the surface of superconductor or junction between normal metal and superconductor . since the both @xmath5- and @xmath73-wave state exist near the interface , josephson current is reduced on 110-junction .",
    "this results is not only by the @xmath5-wave state but also by the existence of the imaginary part of the pair potential of @xmath1-wave .",
    "this reducing is same as in the @xmath42-wave superconductor / @xmath79-wave - superconductor / @xmath42-wave superconductor junction . in this junction",
    "similar reducing occurs by the existence of another symmetry pair potential at the junction .",
    "@xcite in this paper s case @xmath73-wave component plays the different symmetry for the @xmath1-wave component . on the other hand",
    ", josephson current is not reduced on 100-interface .",
    "these results are unusual .",
    "these appear only in the scf calculation . in the non - scf calculation",
    ", these do nt appear .",
    "these result for 110-junction is consistent with ref . 10 , where it s a high barrier limit case .    and adding one more thing , josephson current disappears on @xmath60 both for 110-junction and 100-junction . in the physical point of view",
    ", it is expected that josephson current only exists when insulating barrier or something ( normal metal or different type of superconductor ) exist at the interface",
    ". therefore these results are valid physically .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss dc josephson current for the 110-junction .",
    "pair potential has the imaginary part for @xmath77 , and josephson current is suppressed .",
