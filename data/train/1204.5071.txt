    "while the group @xmath2 corresponds to @xmath5 consisting of three - by - three matrices , the @xmath0 group corresponds to the set of three - by - three matrices of lorentz transformations applicable to the three - dimensional space consisting of one time dimension and two space dimensions .",

    "the radius shrinks to its minimum value @xmath292 when @xmath56 goes to it largest value .",
    "figure  [ poinc11 ] illustrates the circles and their radii .",
    "the ratio of @xmath292 to @xmath290 is @xmath293    if we apply the rotation @xmath294 and then @xmath295 with @xmath296 given in eq.([ratio11 ] ) , this four - vector can be brought into the form @xmath297    within the framework of the traditional three - dimensional geometry of the poincar sphere , it is possible to transform the four vector of eq.([4vec33 ] ) to the four vector of eq.([rps1 ] ) while the value of @xmath285 is left unchanged . on the other hand ,",
    "the lorentz symmetry allows a transformation on this four - vector by @xmath146 with @xmath298 so that the four - vector becomes  ( bakal et al .",
    "2006 ) @xmath299 this means that the radius of the poincar sphere can become zero while the outer radius takes its minimum value @xmath300 .",
    "indeed , the angle @xmath56 determines the minimum radius of the outer sphere . this radius takes the maximum value of @xmath301 when @xmath93 becomes infinity .",
    "the larger radius becomes zero when @xmath302 corresponding to completely coherent beams , and it does not correspond to the real world .    in order to resolve this problem , we note that the large radius and smaller radius are the same and its value is @xmath303 , when @xmath239 .",
    "thus , if we make the lorentz boost of eq.([lt66 ] ) , the result is    @xmath304    the lorentz group , including its rotation subgroup , changes all the parameters for the coherency matrix .",
    "however , it can not change the decoherence angle @xmath56 .",
    "what significance does this carry from the symmetry point of view and from the physical point of view ?    , but its z component does not . ]      it is clear from the previous subsection that the decoherence angle @xmath56 is invariant under lorentz transformations .",
    "we are now looking for another symmetry which will change this variable .",
    "for this purpose we write the coherency matrix of eq.([cocy22b ] ) as @xmath305 and introduce another matrix where @xmath306 is replaced by @xmath307 , which can take the form @xmath308    for the first coherency matrix of eq.([cocy55 ] ) , we know how to transform it into the four - vector @xmath309 with @xmath310 then , the second matrix can be brought to the four - vector @xmath311 with @xmath312    these two expressions lead us to consider the following two four vectors .",
    "@xmath313 in view of the relation @xmath314 , we are led to the five dimensional vector space with @xmath315 , which can start with @xmath316 now we can change the value of the decoherence parameter @xmath93 by changing the angle @xmath56 , but we can change this variable by introducing a rotation matrix applicable to the two - dimensional vector space of @xmath285 and @xmath317 . when all other components vanish we can write the rotation matrix @xmath318 therefore the five - by - five rotation matrix will be of the form @xmath319 which is applicable to the five - component vector @xmath320 , with the two four - dimensional subspaces , corresponding to the coherency matrices @xmath321 & { } & c_t(\\chi ) = \\pmatrix{a^2 & ab~e^{-i\\delta}(\\sin\\chi ) \\cr",

    "their deteminants are @xmath324 resuting in @xmath325 which is independent of the angle @xmath56 .      another important way to measure",
    "the lack of coherence is to calculate the entropy of the system .",
    "the coherency matrices defined in this section become density matrices if their traces are normalized to be one .",
    "thus from eq.([cocy66 ] ) , we can write @xmath326 & { } & \\rho_u(\\chi ) = \\frac{1}{a^2 + b^2 } \\pmatrix{a^2 & ab~e^{-i\\delta}(\\sin\\chi ) \\cr",
    "ba~e^{i\\delta}(\\sin\\chi ) &   b^2 } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these matrices can be diagonalized to @xmath327 & { } & \\rho_u(\\chi ) = \\frac{1}{2 } \\pmatrix{1 + f_u   & 0",
    "\\cr   0 &   1 - f_u } , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath328    then , their entropies become @xmath329 & { } & s_u = -\\left(\\frac{1 + f_u}{2 } \\right ) \\ln{\\left(\\frac{1 + f_u}{2}\\right ) }           - \\left(\\frac{1 - f_u}{2 } \\right ) \\ln{\\left(\\frac{1 - f_u}{2}\\right ) } .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the entropy @xmath330 becomes zero when @xmath239 .",
    "it becomes @xmath331 when @xmath240 .",
    "the entropy @xmath330 is a monotonically increasing function of the angle @xmath56 starting from zero to the above maximum value , which becomes @xmath332 when @xmath333 .    the entropy @xmath334 of the first space is monotonically increasing function of @xmath335 while that of the second space @xmath336 is a decreasing function .",
    "thus , an increase in entropy in the first space leads to a decrease in the second space .",
    "then we can ask whether the sum of these two entropies becomes independent of @xmath335 leading to an entropy conservation of the total system .",
    "the answer is no .",
    "however , this does not cause problems for us , because the second space is not necessarily a physical space .",
    "it could be meaningless to use the same definition of entropy for this space .",
    "on the other hand , as we noted before , we can define the conservation of entropy in terms of the the sum of the determinants of the coherency matrices given in eq.([cocy77 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , this determinant condition does not require that the amplitudes of the two beams to be the same .",
    "what is the meaning of this second space ? in his book on statistical mechanics , feynman makes the following statement about the density matrix  ( feynman 1972 ) : _ when we solve a quantum - mechanical problem , what we really do is divide the universe into two parts - the system in which we are interested and the rest of the universe .",
    "we then usually act as if the system in which we are interested comprised the entire universe . to motivate the use of density matrices ,",
    "let us see what happens when we include the part of the universe outside the system_.    feynman did not specify whether the rest of the universe is observable or not . in either case , it is an interesting exercise to construct a model of the rest of the universe behaving like a physical world . with this point in mind ,",
    "one of us studied two coupled harmonic oscillators in which one of the oscillators correspond to the physical world and the other to the rest of the universe  ( han et al .",
    "1999 ) . in this example",
    ", the rest of the universe is the same as the world in which we do physics . in thermal field theory  (",
    "umezawa et al . 1982 ) , even though based on the same mathematics as that of the coupled oscillators , the rest of the universe is not physically identified , except that it causes thermal excitations of the oscillators in the physical world .",
    "the concept of decoherence occupies one of the central places in the current development of physics . in  ( feynman et al .",
    "1963 ) when the system couples to finite temperature baths the result is an environmentally induced decoherence .",
    "its effects can be determined in tunneling processes  ( caldeira et al . 1983 ) and in two - state systems that are coupled to dissipative environments  ( leggett et al .",
    "the decoherence of the electromagnetic field coupling resonantly to a two - level system  ( anastopoulos et al . 2000 ) and applications of two - level decoherence to qubit systems  ( shiokawa et al . 2004 ) are also investigated in the literature .    the pattern for the two - optical beams arising from phase - randomizing process ( mcalister et al .",
    "1997 ) , is in the same structure of the two - by - two matrix discussed in this paper .",
    "as for the decoherence in the rest of the universe introduced in this work , the system becomes more coherent as the time - variable increases .",
    "although this `` recoherence '' process was considered earlier in the literature  ( anglin et al .",
    "1996 ) , it is premature to expect a two - state system to gain coherence in the real world",
    ". it is thus very safe to say that the second minkowskian space introduced in this paper remains in feynman s rest of the universe .",
    "however , this does not prevent us from constructing a physical system analogous to the decoherent system coupled to a recoherent system .",
    "in this paper , we have organized ray and polarization optics using the language of the lorentz group .",
    "the lorentz group has two - by - two and four - by - four representations . both are useful in optics , and they allow us to gain a unified view of various aspects of optics .",
    "in addition , it was noted that the mathematics applicable to ray and polarization optics is directly applicable to the internal space - time symmetries of elementary particles .",
    "optical systems are favorable in the sense that each mathematical operation has a counterpart that can be performed in optics laboratories .",
    "the lorentz group is also the basic mathematical language for einstein s special relativity .",
    "currently , this group serves useful purposes in many other branches of physics , including optical sciences . in recent years ,",
    "the lorentz group served as the underlying language for squeezed states of light .",
    "it was dirac who first observed that the lorentz boost is a squeeze transformation  ( dirac 1949 ) and constructed representations of the lorentz group using coupled harmonic oscillators  ( dirac 1963 ) .",
    "indeed , dirac s oscillator representation forms the theoretical foundations of squeezed states of light  ( yuen 1976 , yurke et al .",
    "1986 , kim et al .",
    "this aspect of the lorentz group is by now well known in the optics community , and the lorentz group is one of the theoretical tools in quantum optics .",
    "the squeezed state is not the only branch of optics requiring the lorentz group .",
    "it can well be applied to fourier optics  ( bacry et al .",
    "1981 ) while its geometry has proven to be useful in designing three dimensional non - imaging concentrators  ( gutierrez et al . 1996 ) .",
    "para - axial wave optics  ( sudarshan et al.1983 , makunda et al . 1983 ) and wavelets  ( han et al .",
