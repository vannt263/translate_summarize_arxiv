    "type ia supernovae ( sne  ia ) are thought to be thermonuclear disruptions of white dwarf ( wd ) stars @xcite , but the details remain uncertain .",
    "one possibility for the progenitors is the single degenerate model in which main sequence stars or post main sequence red giants transfer mass to a wd through roche lobe overflow or a common envelope and the wd grows close to the chandrasekhar mass @xmath6 . due to compression , the thermonuclear runaway starts near the center leading to the explosion of the wd and a rapidly expanding envelope with a mass close to @xmath6 .",
    "a second possibility is the double degenerate model in which a pair of wds merge and lead to an explosion . in most such cases ,",
    "the resulting mass of the rapidly expanding envelope will be different from @xmath6 .",
    "residual material from these mergers surrounding the explosions will get swept up by the ejecta forming dense , shell - like structures .",
    "although the explosion of single wds seems to be favored for the majority of objects , we may expect mergers to contribute to the sne  ia population ( see  [ obs ] ) .",
    "the possibility of different progenitor channels , the population of which may vary with redshift , may pose a challenge for the use of sne  ia in cosmological studies that rely on a single parameterization , such as a light curve width to peak luminosity relation , lwr , to reduce the intrinsic scatter in the peak magnitudes and render them standard candles @xcite .",
    "to first order , the lwr relation can be understood as a result of different amounts of @xmath7ni produced during the explosion @xcite .",
    "there may be some spread and an offset in lwr introduced by one of the channels if the masses of the envelope differ from @xmath6 , and/or the density structures differ .",
    "this can lead to a systematic shift of lwr with redshift if the evolutionary time scales of the progenitor systems differ . even if the different progenitor scenarios obey the same lwr",
    ", differences in the color could introduce systematic errors in cosmological studies because sne  ia are known to suffer to some degree from reddening in their respective host galaxies which has to be taken into account . to correct for this , the maximum light color excess ( usually @xmath8 ) and",
    "an average reddening law are used to determine the amount of absorption .",
    "sne  ia that are intrinsically redder as compared to the average local sample will thus be over - corrected in this fashion to a higher luminosity .",
    "similarly to the two distinct progenitor channels , qualitative variations in the explosion physics may lead to various classes of sne  ia even within the single degenerate scenarios .",
    "standard explosion models include delayed detonations ( dd ) and deflagrations . in these scenarios , burning during the deflagration phase",
    "leads to an unbound wd . in dd models ,",
    "the deflagration turns into a detonation in an expanding envelope . because the density structure of the wd declines monotonically with radius , the resulting density structure in the expanding envelope also smoothly declines with mass and radius .",
    "a variation of dd models are the pulsating delayed detonation models ( pdd ; @xcite ) . in these models ,",
    "the total energy production during the deflagration phase is , by construction , lower and insufficient to unbind the wd .",
    "this results in large amplitude pulsations . because the fall - back time increases with distance , the inner regions contract and",
    "leave a shell behind at larger distances . due to infall driven compression , a detonation",
    "is triggered , the material behind the burning front is accelerated , and this expanding material runs into the low - velocity material left at larger distances .",
    "similar to the merger scenario , a shell - like structure is formed with very similar light curve and spectroscopic properties , but with a total mass close to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "these two groups , consisting of dd and deflagration models such as w7 @xcite , which lack shells , and the models with shells ( mergers and pdds ) , can be differentiated by their predictions for the photospheric evolution and maximum light colors @xcite . for the former group ,",
    "the photospheric velocities , @xmath9 , smoothly decline with time and the models show a blue color at maximum light , @xmath10 ; in the latter group , @xmath9 shows a plateau in the evolution as the photosphere recedes through the shell .",
    "these models are intrinsically redder and slightly over - luminous because of the lower expansion rate in the inner region . as shown in @xcite the color , length and velocity of the plateau",
    "are correlated with the mass of the shell , and this potentially allows the two groups to be distinguished even for similar brightnesses .",
    "indeed , there is a growing sample of sne  ia showing photospheric velocity plateaus ( e.g. 1990n ; @xcite ; 1991 t , 1999aa ; @xcite ; 1999ee ; @xcite ; 2000cx ; @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "many of these sne  ia have been reported as having a red color @xmath11 at maximum , but this is typically attributed to reddening along the line of sight .",
    "alternatively , this sample may suggest the contribution of events with shell - like density structures in the observed population .",
    "these events may be understood in terms of mergers or pdds ; however , the inhomogeneities and incompleteness of individual data sets in the literature preclude definite conclusions .    to address this problem and others , we started the texas supernovae search ( tss ; quimby et al . in prep . ) with the goal of providing a homogeneous set of quality data for several supernovae beginning well before maximum light .",
    "in this paper , we present our observations of sn  2005hj and analysis of the data . in  [ obs ]",
    "we describe the discovery and give the details for both the photometric and spectroscopic follow - up . in  [ models ] we discuss generic properties of explosion models and suggest a secondary parameter to separate models with and without shells , and analyze the peculiarities of sn  2005hj .",
    "conclusions and discussion are presented in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "sn  2005hj was discovered on october 26.13 ut in the field of abell 194 as part of the tss .",
    "the tss uses the wide field ( @xmath12 ) 0.45 m rotse - iiib telescope @xcite at the mcdonald observatory in texas to scan nearby galaxy clusters nightly for transients with a modified version of the psf - matched image subtraction code from the supernova cosmology project .",
    "sn  2005hj was found at an unfiltered magnitude ( calibrated against the usno - b1.0 r2 ) of @xmath13 and is located at @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "the foreground reddening at this location is @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "examination of rotse - iiib images from oct .",
    "20 and oct .",
    "22 shows the sn was detected prior to discovery , but not significantly well to pass the search pipeline s automatic cuts .",
    "figure [ lc ] shows the rotse - iiib light curve for sn  2005hj through 40 days after maximum light . to construct the light curve",
    ", we co - added images taken on a given night ( usually 6 ) excluding any frames of significantly lower quality due to passing clouds or wind sheer , and then subtracted the reference image convolved to the same psf .",
    "magnitudes were determined by fitting the local psf ( derived from the co - added nightly images ) to the location of the sn on the subtracted frame using custom software and the daophot psf - fitting routines ( @xcite ported to idl by @xcite ) .    the unfiltered ccd response of rotse - iiib has an approximate full width of @xmath17    centered in the @xmath18-band around 6000   .",
    "because we do have some sensitivity in the blue and since the @xmath11 colors of sne  ia typically grow @xmath19 mag redder in the 30 days after maximum @xcite , there is a blue deficit at later times that causes our unfiltered magnitudes to decline more rapidly than the true @xmath18-band fading .",
    "note that @xmath20 colors of sne  ia are close to zero at maximum light .",
    "we therefore limit the light curve fitting to data taken before 10 days after maximum ( determined through several iterations of the fit ) , during which the color evolution is minimal . the best fit @xmath18-band template from @xcite is also shown in figure [ lc ] .",
    "the date of maximum light determined from the fit is nov .",
    "1.6 with a formal error of 0.7 days ( note the template phases are relative to the @xmath21-band maximum ) .",
    "the best fit stretch factor @xcite for the light curve width is @xmath22 .",
    "the preliminary measurement of the observed @xmath11 color at @xmath23 maximum from the carnegie supernova project is @xmath24 after removal of the host light but before any extinction or @xmath25-corrections are applied ( m. m. phillips , private communication ) .    near real - time photometric analysis combined with target of opportunity ( too ) time on the neighboring 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) allowed us to obtain optical spectra just 4 hours after the discovery images were taken and every few days over the next 6 weeks .",
    "these observations are detailed in table [ spec ] .",
    "the instrumental response is such that very little second order light is expected blue of 8900    even with the gg385 blocking filter .",
    "the data were reduced in the optimal manner using iraf and custom idl scripts .",
    "the wavelength scale was calibrated against cd and ne lamps and its accuracy was verified by comparing night sky lines to the spectral atlas of @xcite . because the het pupil size varies for different tracks , absolute flux calibration can not reliably be achieved ; however , we used the standard stars of @xcite and @xcite , which were observed using the same setups , to achieve _ relative _ spectrophotometric calibration and to remove strong telluric features .",
    "the redshift of the host galaxy was derived from narrow emission lines around 7000    ( observed ) , which we attribute to h-@xmath26 , [ ] , and [ ] in the host galaxy .",
    "we combined all the spectra and simultaneously fit these lines with gaussians to determine the line centers .",
    "the line redshifts are best fit by @xmath27 , and we adopt this value for the sn .",
    "this gives sn  2005hj an absolute peak magnitude of @xmath1 in our unfiltered band pass ( assuming h@xmath28=71 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) , and places the host well behind abell 194 ( @xmath31 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the brightness and broad light curve shape suggest that sn  2005hj is a slightly over - luminous sn  ia .",
    "the unfiltered rotse - iiib reference image shows that the host for sn  2005hj is relatively bright ( @xmath32 ) and compact , and is therefore likely a significant contaminant to our spectra .",
    "thus , we have to subtract the galaxy contribution ( see fig . [ spec0 ] ) . lacking an observed spectrum for the host galaxy excluding the sn light , we constrained the galaxy sed using archival sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xmath33 observations and obtained a template galaxy spectrum ( n. drory 2005 , private communication ) .",
    "the relative amounts of sn and galaxy light in the spectral apertures will vary not only with the changing sn brightness , but also with the seeing , slit width and positioning .",
    "also plotted in figure [ spec0 ] is a spectrum of sn  1999aa ( blue curve ) constructed via a linear interpolation of the @xmath34 day and @xmath35 day spectra presented by @xcite . noting the similarity of the spectral features of sn  1999aa and sn  2005hj",
    ", we assume that we can model our observed spectra as a linear combination of our galaxy template and the sn  1999aa spectra interpolated to the same phase as the sn  2005hj observations .",
    "we perform a least squares fit to determine the relative contributions of each component .",
    "the red line in figure [ spec0 ] shows the derived contribution of galaxy light in the @xmath36 day spectrum . aside from a few small differences ( most noticeably in the @xmath374481 triplet ) ,",
    "some of which may be explained by calibration errors , the combined sn  1999aa + host spectrum ( purple curve ) is a good fit .",
    "the over all fit is improved if we interpolate the sn  1999aa spectra to @xmath38 days instead of @xmath36 , especially in the 5400    to 6500    range , which could imply a @xmath391 day error in the date of maximum light or different time scales for the spectral evolutions of the two sne .",
    "we repeated this process for all the sn  2005hj spectra , each time using the same galaxy template and the sn1999aa spectra ( interpolated to the appropriate phase ) as reference to determine the relative amount of galaxy light .",
    "in general , the galaxy template added to the sn  1999aa spectra does an excellent job of reproducing the observed sn  2005hj spectra .",
    "the galaxy light typically dominates the flux red of 7000   .",
    "figure [ spec ] shows the spectral evolution of sn  2005hj recorded by the het between days @xmath36 and @xmath40 with the derived galaxy contribution subtracted .",
    "overall , sn  2005hj shows spectra with lines dominated by intermediate mass and iron group elements as is typical for sne  ia .",
    "while the lines show normal expansion velocities , the absorption components are more narrow and , for the early phases , weaker than typically observed , as exemplified by the @xmath376355 line ( see fig .",
    "[ spec1 ] ) .",
    "sn  2005hj also shows an atypical velocity evolution of these features over time .",
    "line minima are useful diagnostic indicators of the ejecta structure as they give the abundances and velocities of the material .",
    "the actual measurement of the velocity at the minimum of the line profile is complicated by the presence of the continuum , other blended lines , and some uncertainty in the true line profile shape .",
    "detailed modeling is required to accurately sort out all the components and how they relate to the photospheric layer to reveal the velocity distribution of the ejecta larger than those measured from weak lines . however , for shell models the steep density gradients cause even strong lines to from very close ( in radius ) to the actual photosphere . ] .",
    "such models have shown that the absorption minima approximate the photospheric expansion velocities to within about 1000 km s@xmath3 at maximum light @xcite .",
    "thus , simple line fitting can lead to a rough description of the ejecta velocities , and allows a useful comparison to discriminate between different models . at late times",
    "the photosphere will recede below the si rich layer and so the velocities derived from the @xmath376355 line will become increasingly discrepant with the photospheric velocity . for deflagration and classical detonation models , this departure will begin to set in 1 - 2 weeks after maximum light @xcite .",
    "the strength of the @xmath376355 line and its persistence from at least 2 weeks before to 4 weeks after maximum light make it a valuable tool for probing the ejecta .",
    "its evolution with time is shown in figure [ siii ] for the case of sn  2005hj . to determine the velocity , we smooth the spectra by fourier transform filtering , divide by the estimated continuum , and then select the lowest point using spline interpolation over a selected range . the continuum is represented by a medium order ( 6th - 7th ) polynomial fit to regions of the spectra that are not strongly affected by lines . to smooth the spectra",
    ", we use a fourier transform to convert the data into a power spectrum , and then multiply this by a filter to remove high frequency variations .",
    "we then apply a reverse ft to the filtered power spectrum to recover the smoothed spectrum .",

    "only the spectral bins with signal to noise above 25 were considered ( note the peak throughput for het / lrs is near the @xmath376355 line ) . for consistency , we adopt a single filter for all our analysis , choosing the results from our nosiest data , @xmath48  @xmath3 and @xmath49  @xmath3 , which removes noise in the data but also some real information related to `` sharp '' features in the spectra such as the narrow core to the @xmath376355 absorption in the day @xmath50 spectrum .    using the relativistic doppler formula and the @xmath51-weighted @xmath376355 rest velocity in the host galaxy frame , we convert the wavelengths of the line profile minima into expansion velocities . for each spectrum",
    "we conducted 250,000 monte carlo simulations in which normally distributed noise based on the statistical flux errors was added to the data and the ft smoothed minimum was found .",
    "the peak of the distribution and the interval containing 68% of the simulation results were used to calculate the velocity of the minimum and its error , respectively .",
    "we also measured the relative shift in the region lines over all epochs and found the scatter to be 80 km s@xmath3 , which we add in quadrature to the individual errors .",
    "the results are given in table [ linedata ] and plotted in figure [ linevel ] .",
    "we find that the data points are at 10,600 @xmath52 150 km s@xmath3 between maximum light and @xmath53 days , somewhat faster prior to maximum , and significantly slower on day @xmath54 . by day @xmath40",
    ", the @xmath376355 absorption has all but completely disappeared .    from maximum light through day @xmath50",
    ", the @xmath376355 line profile shows little change in both depth and width in addition to maintaining a constant absorption minimum velocity .",
    "of specific relevance is the blue wing of the absorption profile ; this section of the line is formed by the material at the greatest distance from the photosphere and at the highest velocities , and as such it should be the first to vanish as the photosphere recedes . the consistency of this blue wing from maximum light through day @xmath50 suggests the photosphere falls within the si enriched layers for at least this period . by day @xmath53",
    "the blue wing has shifted significantly to the red , while the red wing remains constant except for the effects of an blend around 6250   .",
    "other features begin to appear or strengthen at this phase as well .",
    "this behavior could be a signal that the si layers are becoming detached from the photosphere by day @xmath53 .",
    "the day @xmath54 spectra show a double minimum at the location of the @xmath376355 feature ( see figure [ day25 ] ) .",
    "telluric absorption is weak in this wavelength range , and the line profile is clearly seen in each of the three individual exposures , which support the reality of this feature .",
    "a possible explanation for this feature is contamination from the host that is not removed by the template subtraction ; however , galaxy spectra do not typically exhibit features in this range that could cause such interference , and even if such were the case , we would expect to see similar behavior in the @xmath40 day spectra .",
    "a second possibility is contamination from lines . using the spectral analysis tool synow @xcite , and the example of sn  1994d as a starting place @xcite",
    ", we find that while likely produces the absorption dips @xmath55    away on either side of the @xmath376355 line , it is unlikely responsible for the double minimum .",
    "the third possibility , which we favor , is that this double minimum simply appears because we are resolving the @xmath376355 doublet .",
    "this result implies that the seen in the @xmath54 day spectra is confined to a very narrow region of velocity space ( @xmath56 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "if accurate , the true minimum of the @xmath376355 doublet would be about 100 - 200 km s@xmath3 faster than indicated in figure [ linevel ] and table [ linedata ] , but still significantly below the plateau velocity",
    ". the emergence of this thin layer may also be responsible for the appearance of the narrow core in the @xmath50 day spectrum as well as the apparent double minimum to the @xmath53 day data .",
    "some remnant of the blue component to the doublet may persist to the @xmath40 day spectrum .",
    "figure [ day25 ] also shows the spectra of several other sne  ia taken around 25 days after maximum light . while the distinctly double minimum appears unique to sn  2005hj",
    ", the width and depth of the feature is roughly consistent with the others .",

    "[ spec_char ] , the observed sne  ia population typically exhibits a 1000 - 3000  km  s@xmath3 decrease in the measured line velocities between 1 week before maximum light to 2 weeks after@xcite , and the deflagration and classical delayed detonation models employed to explain these events have shown a correspondingly large decrease in photospheric velocities over the same period @xcite .",

    "[ modelvel ] ) .",
    "this happens because in expanding envelopes the photosphere recedes in mass and , because of the homologous expansion , in velocity as well .",
    "this behavior results from the smoothly declining density structure of the wd and the fact that variations in the specific energy production are small .",

    "the si layer is thick ( in the mass frame ) because explosive oxygen burning occurs over a wide range of temperatures .",
    "the density gradient is smooth and si is mostly in , so initially the velocity derived from the minimum of the @xmath376355 line smoothly declines with the receding photosphere governed by the geometrical dilution of the expanding envelope .",
    "eventually , the photosphere begins to recede below the si layer at which point the evolution of the @xmath376355 line profile will show the following behavior : 1 ) the optical depth of the highest velocity material at the largest radii will begin to decline below 1 and as such the blue wing of the line profile will start to drift toward the red ; 2 ) as the optical depth decreases , the strength of the line as measured from the line depth will decrease ; 3 ) the line minimum may continue to slow , but it will grow increasingly discrepant with the photospheric velocity .",

    "the duration of the plateau , @xmath68 , is defined by the velocity spread @xmath69 around @xmath70 with @xmath71 km s@xmath3 , which puts the end of the plateau phase safely into the parts of a rapidly declining @xmath9 .",

    "all three parameters , @xmath66 , @xmath75 , and @xmath67 suggest @xmath76 , with the allowed ranges specifically bracketed by 0.15 - 0.6 , 0.1 - 0.25 , and 0.1 - 0.25 @xmath77 for the plateau length , shell velocity , and plateau onset , respectively , taking the observed errors into account .",
    "the comparison between the @xmath11 color as a function of @xmath66 , @xmath75 , or @xmath67 , however , shows only marginal consistency between the observations and the models if we assume only foreground redding by the galaxy .",
    "we note , that the intrinsic @xmath11 color of the models is uncertain by about 0.05 to @xmath78 at maximum light .",
    "the two best - fitting models , pdd3 and det2env2 , show a peak brightness , @xmath79 , of @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , with an uncertainty of @xmath82 @xcite vs. a typical dd model with @xmath83 @xcite ,",
    "i.e. they are brighter by about 20 % mostly due lower escape probablity of @xmath84-rays that results when the @xmath7ni layers are slowed down because of the interaction @xcite .",
    "we have presented photometric and spectroscopic data for sn  2005hj , a slightly over - luminous type ia .",
    "the most striking feature is an apparent plateau in the expansion velocity evolution , which we derive from the @xmath376355 line .",
    "the velocities remain at about @xmath85 km s@xmath3 for about 3 weeks starting slightly before maximum light , and this plateau is bracketed by preceding and succeeding decelerations .",
    "we find that si is confined to a relatively narrow velocity region .",
    "analysis of the detailed observations in concert with published models suggest there may be some physical distinction between sn  2005hj and other normal - bright sne  ia that may systematically affect their use as distance indicators if not properly taken into account .",
    "the models considered include delayed detonations , deflagrations , pulsating delayed detonations and tamped detonation / merger scenarios . in order to explain the narrow @xmath376355 line and its plateau in velocity ,",
    "we suggest an early interaction that forms a dense shell as predicted by merger and pdd models . the spectral and photometric peculiarities are consistent with respect to the velocity , duration , and onset of the plateau , and marginally consistent with the maximum light color , for models that have shells of about @xmath86 .",
    "as indicated by earlier works @xcite , the mass of the interacting shell has been found to be the parameter that dominates the details of these observational signatures independent of how this shell may form .",
    "the tight predicted relation between each of @xmath66 , @xmath75 , and @xmath67 may provide a stable means to separate sn  2005hj like events from regular branch - normal sne  ia .",
    "although the agreement between the shell models and the observations is good , the predictions are not necessarily unique and other possibilities may exist . for example , we have not considered 3-d models such as the detonation from a failed deflagration scenario recently examined by @xcite . for sn  2005hj",
    "then the agreement of the plateau velocity and its duration to that predicted by shell models may simply be a fluke , and in such case this concordance should then not hold for other sne with similar @xmath376355 evolution .",
    "given the data and models considered , we suggest either pdds or merger events are responsible for sn  2005hj , and this implies the existence of two different progenitor channels .    it is important to understand how these two progenitor channels , which may occur in relatively varying fractions as a function of redshift , will impact studies using sne  ia as distance indicators .",
    "@xcite estimate that 20% of sne  ia in their sample are either 1991t - like or 1999aa - like .",
    "these sne show spectral features and a velocity plateau similar to sn  2005hj .",
    "@xcite found 5 1999aa - like events in the @xcite sample out of 20 total sne  ia that were observed early enough to show 1999aa - like spectral features , and one that was 1991t - like ; however , in the pre - loss sample they do not classify any of the 7 sne  ia with early spectra as 1999aa - like .",
    "these nearby samples are constructed from targeted galaxy searches that have different selection biases than the deep cosmological surveys , but we will assume a uniform 2005hj - like rate of 25% for all sne  ia .",
    "sne  ia that appear spectroscopically similar to sn  2005hj in a single epoch could none the less arise from different progenitors , and the mass of the low - density envelope around pdds or mergers may effect their peak magnitudes and/or light curve shapes , but we will further assume that all such events deviate uniformly from the lwr of branch normal sne  ia .",
    "@xcite calculated the relation between peak @xmath23 band magnitudes , @xmath87 , and the fading between maximum light and + 20 days , @xmath88 , for a variety of theoretical models and found that shell models produced @xmath88 that were 0.2 to 0.3 mag smaller than for ( in vacuum ) delayed detonations reaching the same peak magnitude . therefore using the same lwr for shell models will result",
    "in corrected peak magnitudes systematically offset by 0.1 to 0.2 mag .",
    "also , the observed peak magnitudes of sne  ia are usually corrected for absorption along the line of sight using the observed @xmath11 color at maximum light and a reddening law . for events that are intrinsically red",
    ", this will increase the estimated peak magnitude above its already over - luminous intrinsic value .",
    "cosmological studies may therefore need to remove or at least separately handle sn  2005hj - like events to avoid systematic errors in distance .    as a case for",
    "the importance of separating different progenitors , let us consider sn  1999ee . very similar to sn  2005hj",
    ", sn  1999ee shows a plateau with @xmath89 km sec@xmath3 , a duration of @xmath90 days , and an onset at day @xmath91 relative to maximum ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ linevels ] ) .",
    "the @xmath11 color of sn  1999ee was also quite red at maximum light ; @xmath92 after correction for galactic extinction @xcite . based on the standard brightness decline relation and the corresponding colors ,",
    "@xcite derived reddening in the host galaxy of @xmath93 which implies an absolute brightness of @xmath94 similar to snls-03d3bb which @xcite attributed to a super - chandrasekhar mass wd . taking into account the spectroscopic information about the velocity plateau , its length and onset",
    ", we attribute a portion of the red color to the intrinsic properties of the supernova .",
    "we find that the duration of the velocity plateau , its onset and size are consistent with a shell mass of @xmath95 which suggests an intrinsic color @xmath11 of @xmath96 ( see fig .",
    "[ modelprop ] ) .",
    "this reduces the reddening in the host galaxy to @xmath97 and the absolute brightness @xmath87 to @xmath98 , which compares favorably to the model predictions of @xmath99 and @xmath81 for pdd3 and detenv2 , respectively , within the model uncertainties .",
    "note that there is an interstellar sodium line in the spectra that implies some degree of reddening within the host .",
    "there are some apparent spectral differences when compared to sn  2005hj , namely sn  1999ee has a slightly broader blue wing in and stronger absorption around 4900   .",
    "this may either hint toward different explosions scenarios ( i.e. pulsations versus mergers ) , or different viewing angles of asymmetric envelopes .",
    "this brings us to the limitation of our studies . except for the color ,",
    "sn  2005hj fits remarkably well with the merger and pdd model predictions but , still , it is a single event and the good agreement may be coincidental .",
    "we need a large , well - observed sample of similar objects to test and verify or falsify the models and to determine the shell mass distribution .",
    "moreover , 3d effects have been neglected . in reality",
    ", we must expect some dispersion . though pulsating delayed detonation models may be expected to be rather spherical",
    ", mergers may be asymmetric with directionally dependent luminosities and colors .",
    "in fact , both classes may be realized in nature .",
    "as mentioned above , the duration of the plateau , @xmath68 , is defined by the velocity spread around @xmath70 .",
    "the physical width of the shell depends , to first order , on the distance at which the interaction occurs and the density distribution of the interacting expanding media and shell during the hydrodynamical phase of the interaction @xcite .",
    "for obvious reasons , asymmetries of the shell will increase the velocity gradient seen over the shell .",
    "the observations of sn  2005hj indicate a very flat plateau that , in principle , may further constrain the properties of the shell . for sn  2005hj , this may already indicate a rather spherical shell and hint toward the pdd scenario or mergers with an intermediate disk of very large scale heights .",
    "however , additional information needs to be taken into account such as detailed line profiles and statistical properties to break this degeneracy between mergers and pdds .    as a next step ,",
    "detailed models for the explosion , light curves and spectra tailored toward individual events need to be constructed .",
    "whereas the mean velocity of the shell for a given mass is dictated by momentum conservation , the thickness of the shell is limited by the distance of the shell material , the distance sound can travel during the interaction , and the specific density profile within the shell . with increasing distance of the shell , the relative size ( and corresponding velocity spread ) becomes smaller because the sound speed remains about the same .",
    "the intrinsic color will be sensitive to the optical depth of the shell , which is governed by the magnitude of the density jump and thus depends on the distance of the interacting shell from the wd @xcite . the blue @xmath11 color for sn  2005hj may hint of a need to modify the distance and structure of the shell .",
    "precise analysis of such `` non - stable '' features requires detailed model fitting beyond the scope of this paper .    in the recent past ,",
    "both the scenarios leading to shell - like structures have been discounted .",
    "pdd models have been dismissed because 3d deflagration models showed that the wd becomes unbound and thus pulsations would not occur @xcite .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that this solution depends mainly on the ignition conditions , namely the number and locations of ignition points leading to single or multiple bubble solutions , and mixture of bubble solutions leading to raleigh - taylor instabilities . as a result ,",
    "solutions with fewer bubbles are likely to result in a reduced amount of burning , thus only slightly unbinding the wd and increasing the possibility of pdds @xcite .",
    "similarly , the merging scenario has been dismissed because the wd may undergo burning during the merger and result in an accretion induced collapse @xcite , and also on the basis of the long merging time scale .",
    "however both of these results depend sensitively on the initial conditions , and new pathways to the actual merging may effect the results @xcite . in light of our results ,",
    "the predicted death of both of these scenarios may be premature , and further studies are needed .",
    "we would like to thank the staff of the hobby - eberly telescope and mcdonald observatory for their support and the rotse collaboration .",
    "we give specific thanks to j. caldwell , s. odewahn , v. riley , b. roman , s. rostopchin , m. shetrone , e. terrazas , and m. villarreal for their skilled observations with the het , and to f. castro , p. mondol , and m. sellers for their efforts in screening potential sn candidates .",
