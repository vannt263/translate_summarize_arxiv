    "a nonlinear quantum dimer represents the simplest realization of the discrete nonlinear schrdinger equation and has attracted much interest for a long time @xcite .",

    "the observation of these remarkable properties of the closed nonlinear dimer implies application of a probing wave that opens the dimer . respectively ,",

    "what is interesting there is a domain in the space of frequency and amplitude of injected wave where stable stationary solutions of the temporal equations do not exist @xcite .",
    "thus one can expect that the dynamical response of the nonlinear dimer will display features which can not be described by the stationary scattering theory .",
    "in particular injection of a monochromatic symmetric wave into the nonlinear plaquette gives rise to emission of anti - symmetric satellite waves with frequencies different from the frequency of the incident wave @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is known as frequency comb ( fc ) generation and is widely studied in various linear and nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "the fc generation can be interpreted as a modulational instability of the continuous - wave pump mode @xcite revealed even in a single off - channel nonlinear cavity @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that illumination of the nonlinear dimer with a monochromatic wave in the domain of instability gives rise to fc generation .",
    "the nonlinear dimer can be realized in 2d photonic crystal in the form of coupled microcavities based on two identical dielectric defect rods with the kerr effect @xcite as shown in fig .",

    "small enough we can present each rod by a single site variable @xmath0 disregarding space inhomogeneity of electromagnetic field in the rods . in terms of the eigenfunctions of the maxwell equations for each microcavity",
    "it means that only the monopole mode with the eigenfrequency @xmath1 resides in the photonic crystal waveguide propagation band and thereby is relevant in the scattering . for simplicity",
    "we disregard the dispersion properties of the waveguide and write for the dimer illuminated by light with the amplitude @xmath2 and frequency @xmath3 the following temporal coupled mode theory ( cmt ) equations @xcite @xmath4 here the terms @xmath5 account for the kerr effect of each microcavity , the term @xmath6 is responsible for the coupling of the off - channel cavity with the waveguide .",
    "the monopole mode of each cavity is localized within a few lattice units @xcite .",
    "if the cavities are positioned far from waveguide we can neglect direct coupling @xmath7 between them .",
    "however even for this case the open nonlinear dimer remains cardinally different from the case of the closed dimer because of the interaction between the cavities via the continuum .",
