    "following a decade of precision cosmology we move confidently into the decade in which we expect the process(es ) of galaxy formation to become clear . the problem is well defined",
    ", how did baryonic matter assemble from the smooth distribution of neutral atoms at recombination to the @xmath1m@xmath2 conglomerations of dust , gas , and stars that we see today .",
    "as we enter 2010 it is sobering to have to acknowledge that we do not yet have a cohesive model of galaxy formation @xcite but rather an extensive body of empirical results from diverse approaches and which are often in conflict ( does the imf vary or not ? , why does the cosmic star - formation history overpredict the local stellar mass density ? , is the merger rate high or low ?",
    "how exactly do agn fit in ? ) , and that these fragmented bodies of evidence sit uncomfortably with the obvious bottom - up merger - rich inference one naturally draws from the hierarchical - cdm paradigm ( why does the majority of stellar mass sit in thin fragile discs if merging is the principle formation mechanism ?",
    "why do both galaxies and agn follow downsizing trends if the majority of massive systems form late ? ) .    at the outset of this journey",
    "it may be worth lightening our burden in two ways : firstly by acknowledging that probably a significant fraction of the current literature is in error ( or at least dominated by poorly quantified systematics ) , and secondly that while hierarchical - cdm has been spectacularly successful at explaining the large - scale structure ( @xmath3mpc ) , the exact processes by which the baryons evolve remains a matter of prescriptive speculation .",
    "monolithic collapse , feedback , merging , and hot / cold gas infall sure , but how much of each , and how are they regulated ?",
    "the modeling , while a vital industry and visually spectacular , should not overshadow or overly influence the empirically driven process of discovery , but rather augment it .",
    "nor should we be over - burdened with statistical precision given the domination of the data by hidden systematics .",
    "so many of the papers i referee focus exquisitely on the statistical errors while paying scant regard to the systematics errors , some of which are laid out here .    despite the plight of the world economies , we move into the new decade with a truly outstanding set of facilities coming online , for example : the refurbished hst , the herschel and wise missions , the commissioning of vista and alma , and the opening up of 21 cm studies beyond 12000km / s via askap and meerkat , and in the longer term jwst , lsst , the ska , and snap / dune / euclid ( and too many more to mention ) .",
    "it is up to us not to fumble the opportunity this problem and these facilities provide , nor be overly fettered by the preconceptions we carry with us .    in this review",
    "i highlight ten practical issues which together convince me that low rather than high redshift is the place to start , that the time has come to truly embrace the multiwavelength approach , and that as much as we enjoy working in small teams the way forward is through large , open , and internationally cooperative collaborations .",
    "what exactly constitutes a galaxy ? is it a single entity best defined by global parameters ( size , colour , flux ) , or a more complex construction of distinct components ( bulge , bar , disc ) ? which components are transient and which might represent a fundamental imprint of its formation history ?",
    "the legacy of hubble s initial classification scheme devised over 80 years ago lives on as galaxies are most often defined by their hubble type ( a global measure ) , but why ? if the bulge and disc are co - eval entities whose properties are co - dependent then this makes sense but , putting aside the question of pseudo - bulges , it is difficult to find any property beyond total luminosity which discs and bulges share .",
    "the ages , metallicities , dynamics , dust , star - formation rates are all distinct evoking the notion of a least two fully distinct evolutionary processes and pathways .",
    "a classical bulge shares more commonality with a giant elliptical than the disc so surely it is logical to isolate the bulges and discs and look for commonalities and correlations within each structural group rather than with hubble type .",
    "perhaps this is best illustrated through galaxy bimodality ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , where the blue cloud and red sequence ( global measurements ) provide a less clear distinction than that provided by the bulges and discs ( component measurements ) . as a community",
    "we know this deep down but the blue / red mantra along with the hubble tuning fork is proving hard to leave behind .",
    "the spatial distribution reflects the combined orbits of billions of stars which are not trivially established or perturbed .",
    "this is distinct to spectroscopic information which contains a rich chemical imprint but only upto the last major episode of star - formation ( typically a few gyrs ) . while dynamics are robust to star - formation ( except in the case of a rare major - merger ) , composite spectra are not and so the spatial distribution is more likely to contain an imprint of the full lifetime of the system and spectroscopy the current state - of - play .",
    "however despite the potential of structure to probe the full dynamical history the ( detailed ) study of galaxy structure is currently limited to the very local domain and mostly in atypical cluster environments ( e.g. , virgo , fornax , and coma ) .",
    "if one accepts that structure ( and by this one means the stable and dynamically coupled configurations of billions of stars ) is a byproduct of the formation history the next key question is whether all structure is important or whether their exists a hierarchy .",
    "for example one could attempt to separate galaxies into nucleus , bulge , pseudo - bulge , bar , inner disc , outer disc , outer truncation but this might be going too far .",
    "2 shows two possible hierarchies ( schemes ) and readers will probably identify others .",
    "this is a key area where the theorists and simulators can inform the observers as to which structures are fundamental , which are transient , and which measurable quantity might best connect to key physical processes ( mechanism , timescales and rates ) .",
    "one of the reasons structural decomposition has stalled at low redshift is the difficulty in unambiguously profiling galaxies as their resolution dwindles @xcite and in the presence of dust @xcite . from the ground",
    "credible bulge - disc decomposition is probably limited to @xmath4 where the spatial resolution approaches typically 1kpc per arcsecond . with hst",
    "one can actually resolve bound structures to @xmath5kpc resolution across the full path - length of the universe thanks to the diameter - distance relation but one is of course hit by the surface brightness dimming , the shift to more clumpy shorter rest - wavelengths , and perhaps more fundamentally the apparent evolution in structure from grand - design ( order ) at low redshift to train - wrecks ( chaos ) at high redshift .",
    "exactly when ordered structure appears and how this depends on environment are key questions we should be able to address if we remain mindful of the selection biases at work .",
    "3 shows two equally valid decompositions for a nearby galaxy , one with a bar and one without , but which is correct and how to robustly automate the decision making process .",
    "some will argue , with good reason , that dynamical information will always be required to unambiguously identify bar and pseudo - bulge components .",
    "even the basic question of exactly how to measure the total flux of a galaxy is unclear . in common usage",
    "are circular petrosian ( sdss ; ukidss ) , elliptical kron ( mgc ; sextractor ) and circularised elliptical isophotal ( 2mass ) .",
    "however none of these will actually be meaningful if only the very central portion ( @xmath5r@xmath6 ) of the galaxy was initially detected ( e.g. , if one detects just the bulge none of these methods will recover the disc ) .",
    "for example it is often stated that an sdss petrosian magnitude will recover 80% of the flux of an ( @xmath7 ) elliptical galaxy .",
    "however this is only correct if the true intrinsic effective radius is sampled in the initial isophotal detection process ( rarely the case for high - z or low luminosity local systems ) @xcite .",
    "a promising way forward is profile or srsic fitting via sophisticated image - analysis packages such as galfit3 , gim2d and buddha , however one still has to deal with what lies beneath the isophote in terms of truncation , and anti - truncation of the outer disc profile @xcite . as a consequence",
    "it is quite easy to underestimate both fluxes ( and sizes ) of low surface brightness ( i.e. , low luminosity and high - z objects ) by a factor of 1mag or more .",
    "the question once posed by mike disney @xcite as to whether we are missing populations of giant galaxies ( aka crouching giants ) has perhaps morphed into a much more subtle question as to how much light are we missing from the galaxies we detect .",
    "the only credible solution appears to be deeper imaging yet this invariably reveals more structural complexity and extreme asymmetry ( see discussion of faint outer structures in the review by annette ferguson in these proceedings ) .",
    "4 highlights the flux bias by showing srsic photometry minus sdss photometry as a logarithmic function of the srsic index .",
    "as we see for high srsic indices the photometric error becomes severe even at low redshift @xcite .",
    "incompleteness can be defined in many ways , typically we use it to refer to spectroscopic incompleteness whereby only some percentage of an input catalogue has confirmed redshifts ( e.g. , 88% 2dfgrs , 90% sdss , 98% mgc ) . surely the missing few per cent does nt matter ?",
    "well ... it depends what they are !",
    "if the missing systems are preferentially low luminosity then the problem becomes serious : a tiny population which is only observable within a tiny volume implies a massive population with a massive error @xcite .",
    "we also have incompleteness in our input catalogue which can have two causes , ( 1 ) a population of galaxies never detected , and/or , ( 2 ) a population whose flux was systematically underestimated and therefore underrepresented after any magnitude cut ( i.e. , missing galaxies and missing light ) .",
    "the first of these is unlikely to affect the giant galaxies where the majority of the total cosmic stellar mass lies @xcite , however the second is an insidious bias which potentially effects every galaxy @xcite .",
    "how severe is it ?",
    "until we work out how to measure galaxy photometry correctly this issue remains unclear @xcite .",
    "ultimately these issues can only be minimised ( and never entirely overcome ) by deeper imaging and higher spectroscopic completeness both of which are not easily appreciated by time allocation committees .",
    "5 illustrates the parameter space currently probed by the widest and deepest surveys implying our census even locally is woefully incomplete .",
    "cosmic ( or sample ) variance is present in all our surveys @xcite .",
    "in fact one of the conclusions , buried in one of the 2dfgrs papers , is that deriving the power - spectrum for larger samples is to some extent fruitless as it is perfectly plausible that our entire observable universe could be a very slightly anomalous region of the entire universe .",
    "the exact scale at which the universe becomes homogeneous is actually ill defined with interesting anomalies arising in wmap5 .",
    "if the entire observable universe is potentially prone to cosmic variance then your local or pencil beam survey is most definitely prone to cosmic variance .",
    "6 shows how cosmic variance depends on total survey volume derived by slicing and dicing the sdss .",
    "cosmic variance only falls below 10% once a volume of @xmath8mpc@xmath9 has been sampled ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "7 shows cone plots from the gama survey using either @xmath11 photometric redshifts ( upper ) or spectroscopic redshifts ( lower ) . as we probe to fainter fluxes we sample more actively star - forming galaxies ( flatter seds ) , the low luminosity population ( intrinsically flatter seds ) , and our sed measurements become noisier , as well as more severely dust attenuated ( see below ) .",
    "the photo - z method relies heavily on the existence of a strong 4000  break which will diminish with limiting flux for the reasons indicated above .",
    "while photo - z s allow us to move forward the resulting luminosity distributions and various densities can only be taken as indicative at best .        .",
    "8 shows the classic galaxy ngc891 viewed from the fuv through the optical and into the near - ir .",
    "the star - formation lane broadens into the stellar population with a dust lane that gradually fades and then brightens as one sees only the glowing dust .",
    "the hi disc extends 5 - 10 times further than the stellar disc ( see review by lister staveley - smith and others in these proceedings ) , and often engulfs or shows hi bridges ( streams ) with otherwise apparently optically detached systems . as galaxy formation is encapsulated in the gas - star - dust cycle observations in the uv , optical , far - ir and radio are an absolute necessity if one is to untangle this interplay .          for most of the past two decades",
    "we ve managed to sweep dust under the carpet .",
    "having agreed to disagree in the 90s following the bloody - nose era of optically thick and thin sandwiches and slabs @xcite .",
    "we re now seeing a multitude of results from the mgc @xcite,@xcite and sdss @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite categorically demonstrating that the distribution of face - on systems bears little resemblance to edge - on systems with attenuation being measured in magnitudes rather than tenths of a magnitude . unless we wish to dispense with the cp we are left to conclude that dust is playing havoc with our optical measurements and at this moment in time represents by far the largest systematic affecting all optical surveys .",
    "the problem gets worse towards higher redshift as one views more heavily attenuated wavelengths and the evolution of dust is unclear .",
    "ultimately the d(ust)-correction may actually be more severe than the better known e- and k- corrections . to convey a scale of the problem",
    "our data demonstrate unequivicably that only 50% of the energy produced by stars actually makes it out of the host galaxy .",
    "while we can quantify the mean attenuation and its dependence on inclination the variance within the galaxy population and how this depends on environment and structural properties remains poorly quantified ( although see @xcite . in effect ,",
    "dust attenuation acts as a broad ( many mag ) smoothing filter over all our distributions , moving edge - on giants into the same luminosity bins as face - on dwarfs etc .",
    "there are two solutions here , sophisticated sed modeling incorporating far - ir observations , or simply start from square one in the near - ir ( aka ukidss and vista ) .",
    "9 shows the impact of dust attenuation as a function of inclination on the luminosity distributions of discs and bulges at various wavelengths , indicating the severity of the effect .",
    "the disc of the milky - way is thin , remarkably thin , and appears to have formed some time ago and exhibited a remarkably quiescent history . while one may argue that the milky way is a 10-sigma event it certainly does nt appear to be in any global way .",
    "so how in a hierarchical - cdm universe can such fragile structure come about and remain so pristine for so long .",
    "our recent census @xcite indicates that approximately 60% of the stellar mass is in the form of extended discs .",
    "if discs can only form after the last major merger event then major mergers are the secondary formation mechanism confined to the high - z universe .",
    "the question we re left with is what is the dominant mechanism ?",
    "perhaps one of the most puzzling aspects of the empirical dataset , which highlights the very different picture one might draw from optical versus radio observations , and hence the need to go truly multi - wavelength , is the comparison of the cosmic star - formation history with the cosmic hi gas history as shown on fig .",
    "while the cosmic star - formation shows a varied history the neutral gas content of galaxies appears to stay constant .",
    "if borne out then one needs cold gas to infall at precisely the rate require to counteract the gas lost to star - formation .",
    "this suggests a remarkable conspiracy between the stars and the gas but more importantly the need to better couple optical and radio observations .",
    "my belief is that the answers to the above challenges do not lie in the numerical simulations but in the empirical datasets heading our way , and it is imperative that the people resources and appropriate techniques are put in place to manage and merge these data streams .",
    "11 shows a possible starting point for our empirical blueprint , showing the era of agn activity which ( because of the smbh connection ) must link with bulge formation , and the era of star - formation which must link with disc growth .",
    "as this dwindles we perhaps see three clear phases : bulge growth , disc growth and the current era of secular evolution .",
    "the first goal of the new decade will be to attempt to ask whether the new data confirms or refutes this simple sketch .",
    "from the above i argue that a new kind of galaxy database is needed which is deep enough to provide complete and accurate photometry , has sufficient resolution to enable bulge - disc decomposition , directly samples the dust , stars and gas ( opt , ir , radio ) , and with high spectroscopic completeness and sample size as to squeeze out the biases .",
    "the galaxy and mass assembly ( gama ) survey @xcite has been designed with this in mind , and aims to survey a common block of sky with galex , vst , vista , herschel , ( wise ) , and askap while obtaining spectroscopic redshift confirmation to @xmath12 mag with exceptional completeness .",
    "the survey is nearing the completion of its initial aat allocation ( 66 nights ) enabling the acquisition of 120k systems .",
    "incoming data from all of the imaging facilities will arrive in 2010 followed by askap from 2012 , providing the best possible database from which to start building a detailed empirical blueprint of galaxy formation .",
    "more details on the gama project can be found in driver et al ( 2009 ) @xcite or simply follow our progress on astro - ph .",
    "anyone wishing to become involved in the gama project should feel free to contact spd3st-and.ac.uk ."
