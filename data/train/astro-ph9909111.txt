    "physical models for @xmath0-ray emission from a relativistic fireball , and the ensuing synchrotron emission from the decelerating shock , have generally neglected the feedback of the intense @xmath0-ray flux on the dynamics of the fireball , or on the prompt and delayed emission .",
    "there are , however , several reasons to believe that this interaction can have an important influence on the observed multiwavelength emission from gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "pair creation by high energy photons will raise the radiative efficiency of a shock ( thompson 1997 ) ; and  if the ambient medium is sufficiently dense  it will significantly smear and broaden the observed time profile of the prompt grb .",
    "the pairs also carry net forward momentum which will couple effectively to the ambient medium if this contains a strong enough magnetic field . in this work",
    "we extend previous results on radiative acceleration in the thomson ( noerdlinger 1974 ; odell 1981 ; phinney 1982 ; kovner 1984 ) and klein - nishina ( madau & thompson 1999 , hereafter paper i ) scattering regimes to include the effects of pair creation .",
    "attenuation of the high energy @xmath0-ray spectrum by collisions with soft photons was calculated by baring and harding ( 1997 ) , but the dynamical effects of pair creation and the feedback of radiative acceleration on the scattering depth were not considered in that work . the role of pair creation in accelerating a trans - relativistic outflow from a black - hole accretion disk with a hard x - ray spectrum has been considered recently by beloborodov ( 1999 ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we calculate the rate of acceleration by a thin shell of @xmath0-rays , some of which side - scatter off ambient charges and collide with the main @xmath0-ray beam .",
    "we show that acceleration is much faster ( for a given compactness ) than in the thomson limit , because the highest energy photons provide most of the momentum .",
    "the reduction in the mean inertia per scattering accompanying pair creation significantly increases the limiting lorentz factor over the value for a baryonic plasma . in ",
    "3 we apply these results to grb afterglows .",
    "we consider the deceleration of a relativistic shock propagating into a medium that is itself moving at bulk relativistic speed , and show how the time scaling of the synchrotron emission is modified from the case of a static medium .",
    "we estimate the limiting ambient density above which the @xmath0-ray pulse experiences a large optical depth to scattering .",
    "finally , we note that angular variations in the radiative force will excite non - radial shear flows in the ambient medium that can greatly amplify the pre - existing seed magnetic field .    in the following we will denote by @xmath3 and @xmath4 the incident and scattered photon energies in units of @xmath5 in the ( unprimed ) lab frame , and with @xmath6 the bulk lorentz factor of the flow .",
    "gamma - ray sources of high compactness are opaque to photons that move at an angle with respect to the @xmath0-ray flow .",
    "when the source spectrum extends to an energy @xmath7 , even soft photons will create pairs via @xmath8 , with a cross - section close to thomson near threshold .",
    "this implies that the source of @xmath0-ray radiation must itself expand at relativistic speed .",
    "when the photons are beamed into a narrow angle @xmath9 along the direction of motion , the threshold energy for pair production within the beam is increased to @xmath10 . in paper",
    "i we calculated the radiative acceleration of matter exposed to a strong source of @xmath0-rays , including the full klein - nishina suppression of the scattering cross - section , but did not include the effects of pair creation . however , the same compton scattering process that accelerates material sitting close to a @xmath0-ray source also creates side - moving photons .",
    "when the integrated flux of photons of energy @xmath11 is large , each side - scattered photon deposits its _ entire _ momentum , along with the momentum of a second colliding photon , into an electron - positron pair .",
    "the build - up of a pair plasma ( ` pair loading ' ) through this process , and the bulk acceleration that ensues , will be the subject of this section .      at very high compactness",
    ", the source of gamma - rays must be impulsive ; otherwise the assumption of low scattering optical depth in the accelerating medium is not self - consistent .",
    "we approximate the photon source as a radially propagating shell situated at @xmath12 .",
    "we found in paper i that , in the thomson limit , a test particle surfing the photon shell attains a limiting lorentz factor @xmath13 when the shell is thin enough that the acceleration length is much less than the radius , @xmath14 the parameter @xmath15 is expressed in terms of the integrated energy flux @xmath16 and characterizes the column density of photons @xmath17 through the shell , @xmath18 . when the particles are coupled by a magnetic field and the electrons and positrons",
    "are cold , the mean mass per scattering charge is @xmath19 ( we assume for simplicity a hydrogen plasma and neglect the inertia of the original neutralizing electron component , but not of the pairs . ) the term @xmath20 in this expression must be replaced with the relativistic inertia @xmath21 when the electrons and positrons are hot .",
    "the optical depth to pair creation is proportional to the optical depth parameter @xmath22 , which is in turn proportional to the duration @xmath23 of the gamma - ray pulse , and the source compactness @xmath24 . here ,",
    "@xmath25 and @xmath26 are the source radius and luminosity , respectively .",
    "we assume that the incident spectrum is broadband , extending well above and below @xmath27 .",
    "as long as @xmath28 , even a soft photon that is side - scattered can be absorbed by the main photon beam .",

    "the number of scattering particles in the relativistically expanding material that emits the photons is suppressed by a factor of @xmath2 with respect to the number of photons .",
    "we now calculate the momentum deposited when a ( soft ) photon @xmath29 is side - scattered through an angle @xmath30 and collides with a ( hard ) photon @xmath31 . the combined process of scattering followed by pair creation deposits a net forward momentum @xmath32 in the accelerating medium .",
    "when the scattering charge is cold , the initial energy of the scattered photon in the rest frame of the scattering charge is @xmath33 .",

    "most of the momentum deposited through this process involves the side - scattering of very soft photons , which collide with hard gamma - rays to produce energetic ( and almost radially moving ) pairs .",
    "the minimum ( threshold ) energy of the radial photon can be expressed as a function of the energy and propagation angle of the side - scattered photon , @xmath46 thus , a photon of energy @xmath47 that is side - scattered through an angle @xmath48 creates a pair of energy @xmath49 . during the first stages of the acceleration , this pair will be relativistic in the bulk frame , @xmath50 ( recall that the photon beam is assumed to be radially streaming . )    in the presence of a sufficiently strong magnetic field , this momentum is effectively communicated to the other charges .",
