    "in modern science the phenomena of thermal conductivity is a very common technology for studying of complex objects with complex geometric and physical structure .",
    "the main goal of this work is to suggest a model of temperature evolution for a multilayer cylindrical object , called cryogenic cell , which has application in sources of multicharged ions  @xcite .",
    "the function of the cryogenic cell is a pulse injection ( in the millisecond range ) of the working gases into the working space of the ion source .    in the modern applied thermal engineering the dependences of physical properties of materials on temperature ( even in small interval )",
    "can ensure elegant way for the diagnosis , monitoring and management of complex systems .",
    "such interesting examples are presented in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "pulse injection of a gaseous species could be provided by fast mechanical gate valves , however , robust operation in millisecond range in cryogenic environment is out of their possibilities . the use of temperature properties of gases at cryogenic temperatures could be a real alternative to pulse mechanical gate valves in a millisecond range time operation .",
    "indeed , dependency of vapor pressure of all gases on temperature is very strong in a cryogenic temperature range , i.e. between liquid helium temperature 4.2 k and liquid nitrogen temperature @xmath0 .",
    "typical data for krypton is given in table  [ krypton ] ( see @xcite ) .",
    ".krypton vapour pressure as a function of temperature [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we have suggested a model of temperature evolution for a multilayer cylindrical object , the cryogenic cell for pulse injection ( in millisecond range ) of the gaseous working species into the working space of the ion source .    the algorithm for simulation of heat conduction process with a periodical source in cylindrical multilayer object and its opencl realization have been developed . it is based on explicit  implicit method .",
    "the choice of the difference scheme is suitable for the technical realization ( because of the structural features of the cryogenic cell ) . for the stability of simulations , the transient process model for source switching",
    "is introduced .",
    "it was shown that the temperature regime in the cryogenic cell can be conditionally divided in two parts .",
    "the first part is the setting mode ( around @xmath1 ) , in which the required temperature regime at the surface of the cell has not been reached yet .",
    "the second part is the working mode , in which the required temperature regime at the surface has already been reached .    the mean value of the temperature over the surface changes around the critical one periodically in the interval of @xmath2 ( @xmath3 )",
    ". the key characteristics of the cell has been achieved by a particular choice of the model parameters , i.e.  the conducting ( heating ) layer material , its thicknesses and source characteristics .",
    "we can conclude that :    * the introduced multilayer object ( the cryogenic cell ) could be a real alternative to mechanical gate valves for the millisecond pulse injection . *",
    "the suggested algorithm allows to achieve stable solution for all process even in case of the fast oscillation of source . *",
    "the time of setup mode is much longer than a period of the injection time .",
    "this feature has to be taken into account in future design and operation of the cryogenic cell . *",
    "the simulation shows that the optimal choice of the cell layer materials , thicknesses and source characteristics provides the required pulse temperature regime on @xmath4 of the working surface of the cryogenic cell .    as an outlook one can mention that further optimization could be done with a variation of the materials and geometry of the cell",
