    "in studies of nuclear interactions , two - body scattering data are the primary input for characterizing interaction models . however , @xmath12 hyperon ( y)-nucleon ( n ) scattering data are very limited because of experimental issues . for @xmath13 interactions such as @xmath14 and @xmath5 , there are currently no scattering data .",
    "therefore , the existing @xmath15 and @xmath16 interaction models have a substantial degree of ambiguity . some @xmath15 scattering experiments will be performed at the japan proton accelerator research complex ( j - parc ) in the near future . even at this facility , however , the possibility of performing @xmath5 or @xmath14 scattering experiments is very limited or practically impossible .",
    "hence , in order to obtain useful information on @xmath13 interactions , studies of many - body , hypernuclear structure are indispensable .",
    "our intention in this work is to investigate the possible existence of @xmath6 hypernuclei and to explore the properties of the underlying @xmath5 interactions .",
    "identification of @xmath6 hypernuclei in coming experiments at j - parc will contribute significantly to understanding nuclear structure and interactions in @xmath13 systems , which can lead to an entrance into the world of multi - strangeness . in order to encourage new experiments seeking @xmath6 hypernuclei ,",
    "it is essential to make a detailed theoretical investigation of the possible existence of bound states , despite some uncertainty in contemporary @xmath5 interaction models .",
    "we investigate here the binding energies and structure of @xmath6 hypernuclei produced by @xmath8 reactions on light targets on the basis of microscopic cluster models .",
    "one of the primary issues is how to choose the @xmath5 interaction .",
    "although there are no definitive data for any @xmath6 hypernucleus at present , a few experimental data indicate that @xmath6-nucleus interactions are attractive .",
    "one example is the observed spectrum of the @xmath8 reaction on a @xmath11c target , where the cross sections for @xmath17 production in the threshold region can be interpreted by assuming a @xmath6-nucleus wood - saxon ( ws ) potential with a depth of @xmath18 @xmath19 mev  @xcite .",
    "other indications of attractive @xmath6-nucleus interactions are given by certain emulsion data , the events for twin-@xmath20 hypernuclei , where the initial @xmath17 energies were determined by the identification of all fragments after the @xmath21-@xmath14 conversion in nuclei .",
    "the inferred @xmath17 binding energies are substantially larger than those obtained using only the coulomb interaction  @xcite .",
    "when these @xmath17 states are assumed to be @xmath22 states , the ws potentials obtained from the binding energies are similar to the one above .",
    "these data suggest that the average @xmath5 interaction should be attractive , which we utilize to select the appropriate interaction models . in this work",
    "we adopt two types of @xmath5 interactions , the nijmegen hard - core model d ( nd )  @xcite and the extended soft - core model ( esc04 )  @xcite .",
    "the structure of light @xmath23-shell nuclei can be reasonably described in terms of cluster models composed of two- or three - body subunits . here",
    ", we model the possible @xmath17 hypernuclei produced by @xmath8 reactions on available light @xmath23-shell targets as four - body cluster structures : the possible targets @xmath11c , @xmath24b , @xmath25b , @xmath26be and @xmath27li naturally lead to such cluster configurations as @xmath28be ) , @xmath29li ) , @xmath30li ) , @xmath31he ) and @xmath32h ) , respectively , by conversion of a proton into a @xmath17 .",
    "( in our model calculations , the @xmath33 potential is generated from a g - matrix @xmath5 interaction via a folding procedure . ) here , among the above @xmath17 hypernuclei , @xmath34h(@xmath35 ) is the lightest @xmath17 bound system , as shown in the following section . in the case of lighter targets , @xmath36li , @xmath37he , @xmath38he and @xmath39 ,",
    "the @xmath17-hypernuclear states are composed of @xmath40 , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 and @xmath44 configurations , respectively .",
    "however , these systems are not expected to support bound states , considering the weakly attractive nature of the @xmath5 interactions suggested so far , except for coulomb - bound ( atomic ) states .",
    "thus , possible @xmath17 hypernuclear states to be investigated lie in the light @xmath23-shell region and may be considered to have basically a four - body cluster structure .    this paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii , we describe the basic properties of the @xmath5 interaction models and make clear what is relevant in the present four - body calculations . in sec.iii , we perform the calculation of @xmath0be@xmath45 with some approximations , in order to fix the @xmath5 interaction strengths to be consistent with the @xmath8 data .",
    "the four - body cluster models , based on the gaussian expansion method ( gem ) , have been developed in a series of works for @xmath20 and double-@xmath20 hypernuclei @xcite . in this work ,",
    "similar cluster models are applied to @xmath0be(@xmath46 ) , @xmath47h(@xmath35 ) and @xmath7li(@xmath48 ) . in sec.iv , first we show the calculated behavior of the @xmath49 and @xmath50 systems , as a function of the @xmath51 parameter in the @xmath5 g - matrix interaction , to confirm the binding mechanism before adding neutron(s ) .",
    "then , in sec.v we discuss the calculated results for @xmath34h(@xmath35 ) and @xmath7li(@xmath48 ) .",
    "as stated above , the experimental information on @xmath5 interactions is quite uncertain .",
    "it should be complemented by theoretical considerations .",
    "various @xmath52-based interaction models have been proposed so far . in the construction of these models ,",
    "the scarce @xmath15 scattering data are supplemented by the rich @xmath53 scattering data through use of @xmath52 relations among the meson - baryon coupling constants .",
    "though these models are more or less similar in @xmath12 systems , their @xmath13 @xmath5 predictions differ dramatically from one another ; most are repulsive on average . in order to generate an attractive @xmath5 interaction on the basis of obe modeling",
    ", it seems to be necessary that specific features are imposed . in the past",
    ", the nd model has been popular for @xmath13 interactions , because this model is compatible with the strong @xmath14 attraction indicated by the older data on double @xmath20 hypernuclei , and also it yields attractive @xmath6-nucleus interactions .",
    "these aspects of nd are the result of its specific feature that the unitary - singlet scalar meson is included without any scalar - octet mesons . in this case",
    ", the strong @xmath5 attraction originates from this scalar - singlet meson which gives the same contributions in all @xmath15 and @xmath16 channels . in the case of other nijmegen obe models ,",
    "the attractive contributions of the scalar - singlet mesons are substantially cancelled by those of the scalar - octet mesons , and their @xmath5 sectors are repulsive on average . a different obe modeling for attractive @xmath5 interactions",
    "has been adopted in the ehime model  @xcite , where the insufficient @xmath5 attraction given by scalar - nonet mesons is supplemented by adding another scalar - singlet meson @xmath54 and the coupling constant @xmath55 is adjusted so as to give reasonable @xmath5 attraction , independent of the su3-relations among coupling constants .",
    "the two models , nd and ehime , are essentially similar , in that substantial parts of the @xmath5 attraction result from the scalar - singlet mesons .",
    "more recently , new interaction models esc04 ( a , b , c , d ) have been introduced , models in which two - meson and meson - pair exchanges are taken into account , and in principle no _ ad hoc _ effective boson - exchange potentials are included  @xcite .",
    "the features of the esc04 models differ significantly from those of the obe models , especially in the @xmath13 channels . among the esc04 models ,",
    "esc04d is distinguished , because the resulting @xmath6-nucleus interaction gives attraction suggested by the above experimental situation .",
    "this is mainly due to the following mechanism : a remarkably strong attraction appears in the @xmath56 triplet - even ( @xmath57 ) state , because the strongly repulsive contribution of vector mesons is cancelled by the attractive contributions from axial - vector mesons .",
    "in fact , the attraction in this state is so strong that peculiar @xmath6 bound states are produced in few - body systems @xcite , though such considerations lie outside the scope of the work presented in this paper . in later calculations ,",
    "the important points are the spin- and isospin - averaged even - state interactions , which are strongly attractive owing to the significant @xmath57-state attraction . another important feature of esc04d in the @xmath13 channel is that the meson - pair exchange terms give rise to strong @xmath14-@xmath5-@xmath58 and @xmath5-@xmath59-@xmath58 coupling interactions .",
    "this feature of esc04d makes the conversion widths of @xmath6-hypernuclear states far larger than those for nd .",
    ".partial wave contributions to @xmath60 . in the case of esc04d ,",
    "the medium - induced repulsion is included by taking @xmath61 . in the case of nd ,",
    "the hard - core radii are taken as @xmath62 and 0.45 fm in the @xmath63 and the other states , respectively .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     although the binding energies of @xmath7li ( @xmath64 ) are found to be fairly sensitive to the choice of the @xmath65 values , especially , in the case of esc , we think the results with @xmath66 @xmath67 are most acceptable .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath68li@xmath69 threshold comes below the @xmath70be@xmath71 threshold in most cases .",
    "it is reasonable that the lowest breakup threshold is @xmath68li@xmath69 , because the value of @xmath51 in the @xmath72 system has to be @xmath18 1.0 @xmath67 , similar to the @xmath73be system .",
    "it is notable that the binding energies of @xmath7li measured from the @xmath68li@xmath69 thresholds are similar to each other in both cases of esc(2.6 mev ) and nd ( 2.7 mev ) .",
    "we expect such structure , a valence neutron coupled to @xmath68li hypernucleus , since the lowest threshold is @xmath68li@xmath69 . while , if the @xmath65 value becomes by chance much larger , then the @xmath17 particle is coupled to the ground state of @xmath70be . because the lowest threshold is @xmath74 [ see case ( iii ) in fig .  [ fig : b10xilevel - esc ] ] .    the @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) state is dominated by the @xmath77 ( @xmath78 component of the two - body @xmath79 interaction . as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ volint ] , the @xmath77 interaction for esc ( nd ) is more ( less ) attractive than the @xmath80 interaction . therefore , the @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) state of @xmath7li becomes the ground state in the case of esc ( nd ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b10xilevel - esc ] .",
    "( a)@xmath81li(esc )    ( b)@xmath81li(nd )    more detailed results are given in table [ tab : b10xi ] , which lists also the calculated values of the conversion widths @xmath82 and the r.m.s .",
    "radii , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we show here the results with and without the @xmath33 coulomb interaction .    as seen in table [",
    "tab : b10xi ] , the decay widths @xmath82 calculated with esc are much larger than those for nd , mainly because the @xmath63 @xmath5-@xmath14 coupling interaction in esc is far stronger than that in nd .    the r.m.s .",
    "distance , @xmath83 , both for esc and nd , are comparable to the @xmath84 values in the cases of choosing plausible @xmath51 values . in order to illustrate this situation visually , we show the density distributions of @xmath17 ( solid curves ) and a valence neutron ( dashed curves ) in fig .  [",
    "fig : b10xiden - esc ] ( a ) and",
    "( b ) , where a single - nucleon density in the @xmath85 core is indicated by dotted curves .",
    "the upper part ( a ) and the lower part ( b ) in the figure are for esc and nd , respectively . in the @xmath8 reaction , if the spin - nonflip transition dominates , the @xmath75 state of @xmath7li is selectively excited",
    ". then , we show the density distributions of @xmath75 states .",
    "the densities of the @xmath17 and a valence neutron are extended significantly away from the @xmath85 core .",
    "let us see the effect of the coulomb interaction between the @xmath85 and @xmath17 .",
    "in table [ tab : b10xi ] , we list the binding energy of the @xmath75 state in @xmath7li with and without the coulomb interaction .",
    "the most important result is that the states obtained for @xmath7li are bound without coulomb interactions , namely as nuclear - bound states , for all @xmath65 values for both esc and nd .    according to the above calculations",
    ", we can surely expect the existence of the nuclear bound state with the predicted @xmath17 binding energies of @xmath86 mev ( esc , @xmath87 @xmath67 ) and 2.85 mev ( nd , @xmath88@xmath67 ) , when the imarginary part of @xmath33 interaction is taken account of .",
    "these @xmath89 values seem to be a little smaller in comparison with the empirical value @xmath90 mev suggested in the @xmath91be reaction .",
    "however , to produce @xmath4li , we propose to perform the @xmath92 reaction experiment at j - parc in addition to that with a @xmath11c target .",
    "we say that the @xmath93li ) system produced by the @xmath8 reaction on @xmath25b is suitable to investigate @xmath33 interactions , namely the spin - independent terms of even and odd - state @xmath5 interactions .",
    "in anticipation of priority experiments to be done at the j - parc facility , we have carried out detailed structure calculations for several light p - shell @xmath6-hypernuclei , @xmath0be , @xmath94h , @xmath68li , @xmath47h and @xmath7li , in order to investigate whether we can expect the existence of bound states of the @xmath17 hyperon .",
    "the calculational framework is microscopic three- and four - body cluster models using the gaussian expansion method which has been proved to work quite successfully in obtaining reliable numerical solutions .",
    "one of the essential issues in preparing such detailed calculations is what kind of @xmath5 interactions one should use , because there are no definitive experimental data for any @xmath6-hypernucleus , and also because there are large uncertainties in the spin and isospin dependence in the existing @xmath5 interaction models .",
    "the only existing experimental indication , from the @xmath11c@xmath95be reaction spectrum , is that the @xmath24b-@xmath17 interaction is substantially attractive .",
    "however this constraint is helpful in excluding most of the @xmath52-invariant @xmath96 interaction models which lead to repulsive @xmath6-nucleus potentials . in this work ,",
    "we used two @xmath5 potential models , nd and esc , which give rise to substantially attractive @xmath6-nucleus potentials in accordance with the experimental information .",
    "although the spin- and isospin - components of these two models are very different from each other due to the different meson contributions , we can reliably speak about the spin- and isospin - averaged properties such as @xmath97 .",
    "this is why we have focused our attention on the @xmath85-cluster based systems and started with an investigation of the nuclear spin- and isospin - saturated systems such as @xmath98h ) and @xmath99li ) , so as to get a firm basis of our analyses .",
    "however , the pure @xmath85-cluster systems such as @xmath100 and @xmath101 can not be produced directly , because there are no available nuclear targets for the @xmath8 reaction .",
    "thus , in order to explore realistic experimental possibilities , we have extended the calculation to the four - body @xmath17-systems having one or two additional neutrons .",
    "this explains why we took the @xmath47h@xmath102 ) and @xmath7li@xmath103 ) hypernuclei as the typical @xmath17-systems in this paper .",
    "the major conclusions are summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) in order to be consistent with the existing experimental indication that the @xmath6-nucleus interaction is attractive , the fine tuning of the nd and esc potential models has been made for applications to @xmath6-hypernuclei by adjusting the hard - core radius @xmath104 in nd and the @xmath105 parameter for the medium - induced effect in esc , respectively .",
    "then the @xmath5 g - matrices were derived and represented in terms of three - range gaussians with the @xmath51 parameter expressing its density - dependence within the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath106 coupling term in the bare interaction is renormalized into the imaginary part in the @xmath107-matrix interactions    \\(2 ) first we performed the @xmath108 four - body calculation of @xmath0be and found that @xmath109@xmath67 for @xmath110 and 1.025 @xmath67 for @xmath111 are most appropriate to produce the @xmath112 mev ( without coulomb interaction ) which is that suggested empirically .",
    "these values around @xmath113 @xmath67 are reasonable , because they agree roughly with the values estimated from the average density in a @xmath114 nucleus .",
    "then , we naturally allow smaller @xmath51 values for smaller mass numbers .",
    "\\(3 ) in the basic structure calculations for @xmath98h ) and @xmath99li ) systems , we have tested three values of @xmath65 parameters , @xmath115 and @xmath116 for esc and @xmath117 , 1.025 and 1.3 for nd , respectively . in the @xmath33 system , for which @xmath118 @xmath67 is considered to be reasonable , we obtained only coulomb - assisted bound states with small binding energies , since they disappear without the coulomb interaction . in the @xmath119 system , on the other hand , nuclear bound states are obtained for the acceptable range of @xmath65 between 0.9 @xmath67 and 1.05 @xmath67 .",
    "the calculated binding energies of esc are larger than those of nd , and also the @xmath65-dependence is more sensitive in esc .",
    "if these predictions are confirmed , directly or indirectly , in future experiments , then it will provide a good check for the spin- and isospin - averaged @xmath5 interaction strengths .",
    "\\(4 ) for the lightest realistic example , @xmath47h@xmath120 ) , the four - body calculation predicts the existence of nuclear bound states in both cases of esc and nd at reasonable @xmath65 values of around 0.9 @xmath67 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the addition of two neutrons to the @xmath33 system gives rise to about 1.3 ( 2.0 ) mev more binding for the esc ( nd ) cases , respectively . if the experiment is carried out to observe the @xmath47h bound states , it is useful to extract information about the even - state spin- and isospin - averaged part of the @xmath5 interaction acting between the @xmath85 and @xmath17 .",
    "\\(5 ) for the second realistic example , the @xmath7li(@xmath121 hypernuclus , we have obtained the nuclear @xmath17 bound states as a result of careful four - body calculations with @xmath113 @xmath67 .",
    "this result is essentially based on the averaged attractive nature of the @xmath5 interactions acting in the three - body subsystem of @xmath122 .",
    "it is remarkable to have similar binding energies of the @xmath123 state for both the esc and nd interactions ( @xmath124 mev vs. @xmath125 mev with respect to the @xmath126 threshold ) .",
    "the order of the doublet states ( @xmath127 ) is calculated to be opposite for esc and nd as a result of the difference in the @xmath128 and @xmath129 components of esc and nd acting between the @xmath17 and a neutron .    in conclusion",
    ", it will be quite interesting to observe the newly predicted bound states in future @xmath8 experiments using the @xmath130li and @xmath25b targets in addition to the standard @xmath11c target .",
    "experimental confirmation of these states will surely provide us with definite information on the spin- and isospin - averaged @xmath5 interactions ; note the information on its even - state part from @xmath100 and @xmath122 and its odd - state part from @xmath122 .",
    "such a plan is a challenging project in the study of @xmath6-hypernuclei that have yet to be explored . in order to convert the present predictions into concrete experimental proposals at j - parc ,",
    "the reaction cross sections should be estimated for the @xmath131h , @xmath132li and @xmath133be reactions .",
    "the authors thank b.  f.  gibson for helpful discussions . this work was supported by a grant - in - aid for scientific research from monbukagakusho of japan .",
    "the numerical calculations were performed on the hitachi sr11000 at kek ."
