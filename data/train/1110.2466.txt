    "in the recent decades , the heterogeneous catalysis of metal / metal - oxides has advanced to the sub - nano regime , where one promising catalyst architecture is metal clusters composed of only a few atoms and supported by oxide surfaces .",

    ", the oxides surface does not only provide the support for the cluster but also directly participates in the reaction by supplying charges , adsorption sites , and additional reaction paths.@xcite as one of the most popular model systems on the transition metal - oxide surfaces , the rutile tio@xmath2 ( 110 ) provides rich and controllable surface conditions for studies on various catalytic reactions.@xcite    experimentally , though the tio@xmath2 surface is often prepared in ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) conditions to maintain the cleanliness of the surface as much as possible , it is known that many tio@xmath2 surfaces prepared by ion sputtering and annealing in vacuum have localized band - gap states with ti@xmath4 character.@xcite these gap states , which lie about @xmath5@xmath6 ev below the conduction band minimum ( cbm ) , are believed to be involved with imperfections of the surface , such as surface oxygen vacancies@xcite or near - surface ti - interstitial atoms.@xcite what roles these defects play in the metal / metal - oxides catalysis and how they interact with the metal clusters is not well - understood .",
    "on the scale of several atoms , the size of the metal clusters can have a dramatic effect on the catalytic activity.@xcite for example , in a recent temperature - programmed reaction experiment done by the anderson group , the carbon monoxide oxidation rate in _ vacuo _ shows a @xmath7% jump when the size of the deposited pd@xmath0 cluster increases from monomer ( pd@xmath8 ) to dimer ( pd@xmath2).@xcite in the meantime , it is well - known that metal clusters are vulnerable to sintering processes , in which small sized clusters gradually group into larger ones and finally lose their unique catalytic activity.@xcite    a good understanding of these intriguing catalytic behaviors of pd clusters on titania requires an extensive microscopic knowledge of how pd clusters bind and move on the titania surfaces with the possible existence of surface defects .",
    "a theoretical study , with controlled surface cleanliness , particle size , and number density , is ideal for this purpose . in this paper , based on the density functional theory ( dft ) with hubbard @xmath9 correction , we present a thorough study on the adsorption geometries , energetics , electronic structures , and magnetic properties of pd@xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) clusters as well as the potential energy surface ( pes ) of the pd monomer on the stoichiometric and defective titania surfaces . with these data",
