    "the study of hybrid systems consisting of superconductors ( s ) in contact with clean 2d normal metals ( 2deg ) in magnetic field has attracted considerable interest in recent years.@xcite the quantum transport in this type of structures can be investigated in the framework of andreev refection.@xcite when an electron quasiparticle in a normal metal ( n ) reflects from the interface of the superconductor ( s ) into a hole , cooper pair transfers into the superconductor .",
    "a number of very interesting phenomena based on andreev reflection had been studied in the past .",
    "for example , if the normal metal is surrounded by superconductors , so we have a sns junction , a number of andreev reflections appear at the ns interfaces . in equilibrium",
    "this leads to andreev quasiparticle levels in the normal metal that carry considerable part of the josephson current ; out of the equilibrium , when superconductors are voltage biased , quasiparticles andreev reflect about @xmath7 times transferring large quanta of charge from one superconductor to the other .",
    "this effect is called multiple andreev reflection ( mar).@xcite    effect similar to mar appears at a long enough n - s interface in magnetic field when the magnetic field bends quasiparticle trajectories and makes quasiparticles reflect many times from the superconductor .",
    "if phase coherence is maintained interference between electrons and holes can result in periodic , aharonov  bohm - like oscillations in the magnetoresistance .",
    "the conductance @xmath8 of a s2deg interface in magnetic field was measured in experiments.@xcite it showed highly nonmnotonic dependence with the magnetic field @xmath9 [ large filling factors were considered ] ; the most interesting effect was the oscillations of @xmath8 with the filling factor @xmath6 in a somewhat similar manner as in shubnikov - de gaas effect .",
    "a phenomenological analytical theory of these phenomena based on an `` analogy '' with the aaranov - bohm effect was suggested in ref .. numerical simulation was made in ref .. it was theoretically shown that the transport along the infinitely long s/2deg interface can be described in the framework of electron and hole edge states.@xcite 2deg - s interfaces investigated in the experiments were not infinitely long , but with the length , @xmath1 , of the order of few cyclotron orbits , @xmath2 , of an electron in 2deg at the fermi energy .",
    "quasiclassical theory of the charge transport through 2deg - s interface at large filling factors , arbitrary length of the 2deg - s interface was suggested in ref .. most mentioned above theoretical papers considered the ideal 2deg - s interface : no roughness .",
    "it was shown@xcite that when @xmath10 , @xmath11 oscillates nearly harmonically with @xmath6 , as @xmath12 . when @xmath13 harmonics @xmath14 becomes visible and so on ... in experiments @xmath15 ,",
    "so one would expect good visibility of @xmath16-harmonics in the conductance , where @xmath17 .",
    "but if we try to compare theoretically predicted @xmath11 with the experimentally measured one then we find that 1 ) at @xmath15 only the lowest harmonic @xmath18 is seen in the conductance and higher harmonics are absent ; 2 ) the visibility [ amplitude ] of the conductance oscillations is much smaller than theories predict .",
    "the reason of this disagreement is probably the roughness of the 2deg - s interface in experiments and ideal flatness of this interface in theory .",
    "we try to find in this paper the current voltage characteristics of a 2deg - s interface in magnetic field taking into account the surface roughness .",
    "our approach with the surface roughness possibly helps to make a step towards explanation of the the experimental results .",
    "it is shown that the a disorder at a 2deg - s interface suppresses high harmonics of the the conductance oscillations with @xmath6 .",
    "we consider a junction consisting of a superconductor , 2deg and a normal conductor segments ( see fig.1 ) .",
    "magnetic field @xmath9 is applied along @xmath19 direction , perpendicular to the plain of 2deg .",
    "it is supposed that quasiparticle transport is ballistic ( the mean free path of an electron @xmath20 , where @xmath1 is the length of the 2deg - s boundary ) .",
    "the current @xmath21 is supposed to flow between normal ( n ) and superconducting ( s ) terminals ( the voltage @xmath22 is applied between them ) .",
    "following ref . , we shall describe the transport properties of the junction in terms of electron and hole quasiparticle scattering states , which satisfy bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equations .",
    "then the current through the 2deg - s surface is @xmath23- \\\\ f_{h } \\operatorname{tr}[\\hat 1-r_{hh}+r_{eh}]\\},\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 @xmath22 is the voltage of the normal terminal , the energy @xmath25 is counted from @xmath26 of the superconductor , @xmath27 is the probability of the ( normal ) reflection of an electron with the energy @xmath25 incident on the superconductor in the edge channel with quantum number @xmath28 to an electron going from the superconductor in the channel @xmath29 ; the trace is taken in the channel space .",
    "spin degrees of freedom are included into the channel definition .",
    "so the main task of our work is to find the probabilities @xmath30 , _ etc .",
    "_ then we ll be able to evaluate the current , the conductance , noise and so on.@xcite we ll focus on the situation when if @xmath31 .",
    "then quasiparticles reflected from the superconductor ( s ) due to normal and andreev reflection of the electron return to s again due to bending of the trajectories by magnetic field .",
    "from the first glance it may seem that the reflection probabilities @xmath32 , @xmath33 could be be found using the `` standard '' approach : by matching the incident and outgoing quasiparticle wave functions at @xmath34 and @xmath35 with the linear combinations of the quasiparticle wave functions at the 2deg - s boundary corresponding to andreev edge states.@xcite however this procedure does not look efficient at large filling factors [ experimental parameter range ] and especially for a disordered 2deg - s interface .",
    "next it is difficult to do the matching in practice because the andreev bound states wave functions@xcite and the wave functions of 2deg edge states are localized in different domains in @xmath36 direction .",
    "the andreev bound states wave functions penetrate inside the superconductor on the length scale of the order of @xmath37,@xcite but 2deg edge states wave functions of the incident and outgoing electrons do not penetrate inside the 2deg edges so deep as @xmath37 .    at large filling factors the quasiclassical approximation is applicable .",
    "we show in this paper that within the quasiclassical approximation the matching problem can be solved and @xmath32 , @xmath33 explicitly evaluated .",
    "an electron ( hole ) quasiparticle in 2deg can be viewed in semiclassics as a beam of rays@xcite ( in a similar way propagation of light is described in optics within eikonal approximation in terms of ray beams@xcite ) .",
    "trajectories of the quasiparticle rays can be found from the equations of classical mechanics . in terms of the wave functions",
    "this description means that we somehow make wavepackets from edge states wave functions .",
    "reflection of an electron from the superconductor is schematically shown in figs.[fig1]-[fig4 ] .",
    "the transport properties of the ideally flat 2deg - s interface can be most simply described .",
    "the edge channels do not mix at such interface .",
    "it means in quasiclassical language that electrons ( holes ) skip along the 2deg edge along the same arc - trajectories , like it is shown in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "then @xmath38 and , e.g. , @xmath39 .",
    "the probability of andreev reflection can be found as follows for the trajectories shown in fig.[fig : fig2]-[fig3 ] : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the amplitude of reflection of a quasiparticle ( ray ) @xmath42 into a quasiparticle ( ray ) @xmath43 from the superconductor ; @xmath44 is the quasiclassical action of an electron ( hole ) taken along the part of the trajectory connecting the adjacent points of reflection ; @xmath45 is the maslov index@xcite of the electron trajectory .",
    "the phase @xmath46 arises due to the screening supercurrents .",
    "we assume that the superconductor satisfies the description within the london theory [ usual in experiments ] then @xmath47,@xcite where @xmath48 is the superfluid velocity evaluated at @xmath49 and @xmath50 is electron mass in the superconductor .",
    "we used here the property of london superconductors that the spatial dependence of the vector potential and @xmath48 are small in the perpendicular direction to the superconductor edge on the length scale @xmath37 [ on which the wave functions of the scattering electron and hole quasipartciles penetrate in the superconductor ] .",
    "we introduce the matrix @xmath51 that contains the amplitudes of andreev ( @xmath52 ) and normal ( @xmath53 ) quasiparticle reflection from the superconductor at the point @xmath54",
    ". then the matrix product @xmath55 describes the andreev and normal scattering amplitudes for the case shown in fig.[fig : fig2],[fig3 ] .",
    "so , @xmath56 if there are n reflections from the 2deg - s interface then @xmath57 .",
    "below we show that the matrix @xmath58 can be calculated analytically for any integer @xmath59 when the superfluid velocity @xmath60 is constant so the phase @xmath46 is a linear function of @xmath54",
    ". then the difference , @xmath61 , does not depend on @xmath59 because the 2deg - s interface is flat and @xmath62 .",
    "the matrix @xmath63 can be written as @xmath64 where @xmath65 thus @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "then [ see appendix 1 ] @xmath69 where @xmath70 $ ] , @xmath71    eqs.- give an opportunity to find the probabilities @xmath32 , if given the amplitudes of local reflection , @xmath72 .",
    "the probabilities @xmath32 depend on the position of the first reflection from the 2deg - s interface , @xmath73 , that varies in the range @xmath74 , see fig.[fig : fig2]a .",
    "the number of reflections , @xmath59 , depends on the choice of @xmath73 .",

    "but our theory based on the assumption of the interface flatness predicts @xmath130 while @xmath0 , see fig.[fig_g1 ] .",

    "disorder at the 2deg - s interface makes @xmath131 .",
    "below we demonstrate it .",
    "usually 2deg - s interface is not ideally flat .",
    "the disorder at the interface can be divided at two classes long range and short range with the respect to the characteristic wavelength , @xmath132 , in 2deg .",
    "presence of the long range disorder implies that the 2deg - s interface position fluctuates around the line @xmath49 at length scales much larger than the @xmath133 .",
    "photographs of the experimental setups do not allow to think that 2deg - s interface bends strongly from the line @xmath49 .",
    "so this kind of the disorder is likely not very important .",
    "the short - range disorder includes the fluctuations of the surface at length scales smaller than @xmath134 ; impurities , clusters of atoms at the surface due to defects of the lithography and so on ... when , for example an electron ray falls on the disordered 2deg - s surface the reflected electron rays go off the surface not at a fixed angle but they may go at any angle with certain disorder induced probability distribution . the phases that carry the reflected electron rays going off the surface at different angles may be considered random , so the reflected electron rays can be considered as incoherent.@xcite but to any reflected electron ray an andreev reflected hole ray is attached that is coherent with the electron .",
    "so the interference of rays [ that produces the conductance oscillations ] may be not killed completely by the short range disorder .",
    "below it will be clarified .",
    "`` weak '' short range disorder at 2deg - s interface does not destroy the andreev edge states but it induces transitions between the edge states , see fig.[fig4]b .",

    "b. andreev edge states in quasiclassics make electron - hole orbit - arcs with the same beginning and end . the quasiclassical picture of the disorder - induced transitions is shown in fig.[fig4]a .",
    "disorder at the edges of the 2deg - s interface leads to the orbits depicted in fig.[fig4]c .",
    "strong disorder destroys andreev edge states ; there are no oscillations in the conductance because quasiparticles reflected from the strongly disordered 2deg - s surface are incoherent ; orbits are shown in fig.[fig4]d.,height=377 ]    it is shown below how to describe the transport properties of the weakly short - range disordered 2deg - s interface in magnetic field .",
    "we assume that the andreev approximation conditions , eq . , are fulfilled [ general case brings to qualitatively similar results for the current , it requires same idea of calculations but it is more cumbersome ] then @xmath95 and the fluctuating quantity is @xmath135 .",
    "similarly as before we introduce the matrix @xmath136 where @xmath109 is defined in eq . , @xmath137 and @xmath138    as before , for the situation sketched in fig.[fig4]a , @xmath139 , and , e.g. , @xmath140 .",
