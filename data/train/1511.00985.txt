    "with the detection and first characterization of the higgs particle  @xcite the standard model of physics has seemingly become complete .",
    "a full description in three families of fundamental material particles behaving as fermions , acting upon each other through three fundamental forces via bosonic force - carrying particles , has been formulated in a consistent framework . however , a number of physical phenomena are not contained in the standard model ( sm ) : dark matter and dark energy are not explained ; a connection of the three fundamental sm - forces to gravity can not be made ; and neither is it understood why gravity is such a feeble force .",
    "deeper questions as to why the universe is built in 3 + 1 dimensions , why there exist only 4 forces , and whether the constants of nature may depend on cosmological history or on local space - time conditions remain unanswered as of yet .",
    "it is the paradigm of the present paper that molecular physics may contribute to finding answers to these questions .",
    "the recent searches for a dipole moment of the electron , setting tight constraints of @xmath9 e@xmath10 cm , have already ruled out some supersymmetric extensions to the standard model .",
    "these studies take advantage of the very strong internal polarizing fields of @xmath11 v / cm in ybf  @xcite and tho  @xcite molecules as well as of hff@xmath7 ions  @xcite .    at the most fundamental level laser spectroscopic investigations of molecules",
    "can be applied for an experimental test of the symmetrization postulate of quantum mechanics .",
    "the fact that integer - spin species must exhibit a symmetric wave function upon interchange of identical particles makes that certain rotational quantum states in the @xmath12o@xmath0  @xcite or in the @xmath13c@xmath12o@xmath0  @xcite molecule can not exist .",
    "this provides an experimental platform for the investigation of the symmetrization postulate .",
    "a search for varying constants implies a search for physics beyond the sm .",
    "the fact that the fundamental coupling strengths and other constants such as the mass ratios between particles are inserted as parameters in the fundamental theory suggests that these fundamental constants can be varied at will",
    ". however , a time - variation or a space - time dependence of these constants should be phrased in field theories , and in order for those to remain consistent , even in the simplest approaches , additional fields have to be invoked  @xcite .",
    "such fields can also be associated with fifth forces or quintessence  @xcite .",
    "the hydrogen molecule is an experimental probe for detecting a possible variation of the proton - electron mass ratio @xmath1 , a dimensionless constant of nature .",
    "the strong dipole - allowed spectrum of the lyman and werner bands in the vacuum ultraviolet spectral range provides a sensitive tool for detecting h@xmath0 .",
    "observation of h@xmath0 absorption spectra , redshifted into the atmospheric transmission window ( @xmath14 nm ) with ground - based telescopes constrain putative variations of @xmath5 over time .",
    "since h@xmath0 is the most abundant molecule in the universe , it is readily observed even up to redshifts as high as @xmath15  @xcite providing look - back times of 12.5 billion years into cosmic history .",
    "alternatively , h@xmath0 absorption spectra as observed from photospheres of white dwarf stars can be employed to probe whether this constant @xmath5 depends on special local conditions , such as e.g. gravitational fields .",
    "another approach toward probing new physics from molecules is to carry out ultra - precise measurements on level energies of molecules under well - controlled laboratory conditions .",
    "a historical inspiration is drawn from the discovery of the lamb shift in atomic hydrogen  @xcite , where a measurement of a small shift in the relative energies between @xmath16 and @xmath17 levels led to the birth of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , the modern theory describing the interaction between light and matter . in a similar fashion qed - calculations of small molecular systems",
    "can be tested in precision laser spectroscopic experiments to search for phenomena beyond qed .",
    "any deviations from first principles calculations in the framework of qed can be interpreted in terms of physics beyond the standard model , in terms of fifth forces or quintessence , in terms of extra dimensions , or as any other phenomenon beyond the standard model . here",
    "the status of such searches for new physics from spectroscopy of hydrogen molecules and molecular ions will be discussed .",
    "the remainder of the paper is structured as follows . in sections  [ muvar ] and [ mu - grav ]",
    "the use of the h@xmath0 spectrum for a search for a varying proton - electron mass ratio is discussed , either on a cosmological time scale or as a local variability with dependence on a gravitational field . in section  [ h2metrology ] a number of recent precision measurements on the h@xmath0 molecule , including its dissociation limit , its fundamental ground state vibrational splitting , as well as level energies of a sequence of rotational states and a high vibrational level , are presented . in section  [ h2ionmetrology ] some recent precision measurements on the h@xmath8/hd@xmath7 molecular ions are discussed .",
    "these outcomes of experimental precision studies are compared with the most advanced qed - theoretical calculations for these benchmark molecules in section  [ qed - theory ] .",
    "the agreement found between the experiments and theory is interpreted , in section  [ bsm - physics ] , in terms of setting bounds on a fifth force and on extra dimensions , both concepts beyond the standard model of physics . in the final section  [ outlook ]",
    "an outlook is presented on perspectives to perform more sensitive searches for new physics in these areas .",
    "searches for temporal variations of the proton - electron mass ratio @xmath1 can be conducted by comparing absorption spectra of molecules observed astronomically from high redshift objects with the same spectra measured in the laboratory .",
    "such comparisons can be made for many molecules  @xcite , but molecular hydrogen is often a species of choice since it is the most abundant molecule in the universe , and readily observed at medium to high redshifts .",
    "the relative variation of @xmath5 can be deduced by imposing the following relation to the obtained redshifted wavelengths @xmath18 and laboratory ( zero redshift ) wavelengths @xmath19 : @xmath20 here the redshift parameter @xmath21 relates to the overall redshift of the absorbing hydrogen cloud , and the parameters @xmath22 represent the sensitivity coefficients expressing the induced wavelength shift upon a varying @xmath5 for each individual line in the absorption spectrum of h@xmath0  @xcite : @xmath23    the laboratory wavelengths @xmath19 are determined in laser - based experiments of the @xmath24  lyman and @xmath25  werner bands of h@xmath0 via extreme ultraviolet laser spectroscopy  @xcite achieving accuracies of @xmath26 . even better accuracies were obtained in a study measuring anchor level energies in two - photon doppler - free excitation of the @xmath27  system  @xcite , combined with results of a comprehensive fourier - transform emission study delivering relative values for rovibrational levels in @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 states  @xcite .",

    "a possible small differential effect on the absorption spectrum , due to a varying proton - electron mass ratio and represented by a relative change @xmath41 , may be derived from the spectrum in a comprehensive fit .",
    "in such a fit the molecular physics information on the wavelengths @xmath42 , the oscillator strength @xmath43 , and the natural lifetime broadening parameters @xmath44 for each h@xmath0 line is fixed , the values for the sensitivity coefficients @xmath22 inserted , and the physical parameters describing the absorbing medium , such as the doppler width @xmath45 , the column densities for each @xmath46-level @xmath47 and the redshift @xmath21 are fitted to model the spectrum . from the resulting values of @xmath47",
    "it is found that typical population temperatures of  50 k are found in most cases , although the populations do not exactly represent a boltzmann distribution . in all cases only absorption from the lowest @xmath48 vibrational level is observed for rotational states @xmath49 .",
    "hence the dipole allowed absorption spectrum lies shortward of 1120   and extends to the lyman cutoff of 912  , thus covering the @xmath24  lyman bands from ( 0,0 ) up to ( 17,0 ) and the @xmath25  werner bands up to ( 4,0 ) . in several cases absorption lines of deuterated hydrogen hd",

    "this finding of a positive value for @xmath41 at the 1.9@xmath4 significance level is too small to be interpreted as evidence for a variation of a fundamental constant , and is interpreted as a null result : a constraint on a variation of the proton - electron mass ratio of @xmath60 ( at 3@xmath4 ) .",

    "these calculations did not include hyperfine structure and they were performed in the framework of the born - oppenheimer approximation . in recent years , the hyperfine structure of the molecular hydrogen ions was revisited in a series of theoretical works  @xcite .",

    "the discrepancy is considered insufficient to call for a disagreement with qed and is treated as an outlier within the full data set of experimental level energies to be compared with theory .",

    "this concept was recently applied to two possible extensions of the standard model , one relating to the possible existence of a fifth force acting between hadronic particles within molecules  @xcite and one related to the possible existence of extra dimensions  @xcite . constraints on bsm - physics are then given by the inequality relation : @xmath149      in molecular systems gravity is very weak , as the gravitational field between two protons is weaker than the electromagnetic field by @xmath150 .",
    "the strong interaction is confined to femtometer - scale distances and therefore negligible at the   length scale of a chemical bond in molecules .",
    "this nuclear force exhibits an influence on the shape of the electronic wavefunction and hyperfine structure through nuclear finite - size effects .",
    "these contributions are well known and readily taken into account . due to the smallness of these effects , the discrepancy between proton size values obtained from different methods ( the proton size puzzle  @xcite ) does not play a significant role in the present work .",
    "the weak interaction is also extremely small , below the hz level , in the hydrogen atom  @xcite , and by proxy it is assumed to be similarly small in the lightest molecules h@xmath0 and h@xmath8 .",
    "this implies that experimental tests of transition frequencies and level energies as calculated by qed in fact represent tests of the standard of model of physics ; only the electromagnetic interaction is to be considered when describing the structure of molecules .",
    "the occurrence of a hypothetical fifth force can be expressed in terms of a yukawa potential of the form  @xcite : @xmath151 where @xmath152 is the coupling strength of this force , in analogy with the fine structure constant @xmath153 , and @xmath154 is the range of the force . in a quantum field approach",

    "this effect of a fifth force on level energies can be extended to transition frequencies by calculating the differences in expectation values for ground states @xmath166 and excited states @xmath167 , represented by @xmath168 .",

    "[ limit-5th ] .",
    "the figure shows that the result of the measurement on the ( 8,0 ) high overtone band hd@xmath7 yields the strongest constraint .",
    "this is caused by the fact that the wave function densities and average internuclear distance of @xmath121 deviate more strongly from the ground state wave function @xmath92 in comparison to the other wave functions probed , @xmath93  @xcite and @xmath123  @xcite .",
    "the measurements in hd@xmath7 are currently more accurate than for h@xmath0 , but the effect of the smaller equilibrium distance in h@xmath0 with respect to hd@xmath7 is reflected in a steeper decline of the constraint for the ions below 0.3  .",
    "note also that constraints from d@xmath0 are tighter than those from h@xmath0 because of the @xmath170 factor .",
    "note , however , that this is based on the assumption that protons and neutrons deliver an additive contribution to the fifth force acting between hadrons .",
    "the figure also shows how the values for the dissociation energy d@xmath88 are more constraining than those of the fundamental vibration measured at higher accuracy .",
    "this is because the dissociation limit corresponds to a state with @xmath171 .",

    "as it turns out the effects of gravity become larger in higher dimensional space .",
    "the extra dimensions , if existent , should not extend over large distances otherwise it would be in contradiction with observations . as was postulated already in 1926 by klein the extra dimensions might exist nevertheless in compactified form  @xcite . in our analysis",
