    "the weak gravitational lensing caused by the clusters will distort the cmb pattern in a characteristic way @xcite .",
    "it appears unlikely that the lensing signal of individual clusters on the cmb will be detectable with current experiments , but it may be possible to extract statistical information on the cluster mass distribution by suitably combining the signal caused by large cluster subsamples .",
    "future instruments like alma with high sensitivity and resolution should even be able to detect lensing by few or single clusters .",
    "various possibilities for detecting cluster lensing signals in the cmb were recently discussed .",
    "@xcite suggested to use wiener filtering for estimating the unlensed temperature map , which is then subtracted from the measured lensed map to obtain the deflection field .",
    "@xcite proposed a conceptually similar technique based on subtracting an estimate of the unlensed cmb background , obtained by fitting a temperature gradient to the observed map .",
    "we follow a different route , starting from a non - linear filter suggested by @xcite for extracting the lensing signal of large - scale structure from cmb observations .",
    "since the cmb on cluster scales can be locally approximated by a gradient , the cluster - lensed cmb temperature pattern is randomly oriented .",
    "aiming at a technique which allows cluster - sized cmb images to be stacked in order to extract statistical information on cluster profiles , we thus require a filter which is non - linear in the signal .",
    "@xcite s filter essentially measures the squared gradient of the temperature map and thereby renders the filtered maps suitable for stacking .",
    "we modify the filter in two ways which turn out to improve it substantially when applied to lensing by clusters rather than large - scale structures .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : we summarise cmb lensing and introduce the filter in sect .  2 .",
    "in sect .  3 , we describe simulations of clusters and cluster samples . in sect .  4",
    ", we apply the filter to these simulations , taking the kinetic sunyaev - zeldovich ( ksz ) effect and instrumental noise into account .",
    "we summarise and discuss our results in sect .  5 .",
    "lensing by a thin mass distribution on a single plane can be described by the scalar lensing potential @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the angular - diameter distances from the observer to the lens , the source , and from the lens to the source , respectively , and @xmath4 is the newtonian gravitational potential of the lensing mass distribution , which is integrated along the line - of - sight .",
    "the deflection angle @xmath5 , and the convergence @xmath6 is the scaled surface - mass density ( see e.g.   * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) .",
    "light rays propagating into a direction @xmath7 on the sky are deflected by the angle @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the cmb temperature @xmath9 _ observed _ into direction @xmath7 is the intrinsic temperature @xmath10 at a slightly shifted position , @xmath11\\approx    \\tilde t(\\vec\\theta)-    \\vec\\nabla\\tilde t(\\vec\\theta)\\cdot\\vec\\alpha(\\vec\\theta ) \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "the approximation used here is justified if the intrinsic cmb temperature does not vary much on angular scales which are characteristic for lensing by galaxy clusters .",
    "in fact , on the arc - minute scales of weak cluster lensing , the cmb is almost feature - less and can to first order be approximated by a gradient .",
    "it is clear from eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) that all information on the lensing potential @xmath12 is contained in the lensed map through the deflection - angle field @xmath13 thus it is in principle possible to recover all the information contained in @xmath12 , like for instance the deflection - angle field itself or the lensing convergence .",
    "the lensing deflection ( [ eq:1 ] ) gives rise to a characteristic distortion of the local cmb temperature gradients on which clusters happen to appear projected .",
    "however , the orientation of the signal reflects the random orientation of @xmath14 . stacking clusters , which we anticipate",
    "will be necessary because of the weak signal of a single cluster , thus tends to erase the signal if temperature maps or linear transformations thereof are used .",
    "it is possible to estimate the lensing - induced distortion of the cmb temperature by smoothing over the cluster and fitting a gradient to the resulting field , or replacing the cluster area by a suitably adapted gradient or polynomial functions @xcite .",
    "apart from the fact that any estimate derived from fitting has to vanish at the field boundaries , orientation angles of @xmath14 estimated that way will be uncertain .",
    "stacking cluster fields after lining them up according to their estimated temperature - gradient orientations is therefore still likely to erase a considerable fraction of the signal .",
    "@xcite suggested a non - linear filter which extracts a scalar measure for the lensing pattern from cmb observations .",
    "he started from an essentially wiener - filtered cmb temperature gradient , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the cmb power spectrum , and @xmath17 is the sum of the power spectra of signal and noise .",

    "was used .    as we shall demonstrate later , it is important for our purposes to change @xcite s original filter somewhat , modifying the definition of @xmath18 and aiming at filtering for the cluster convergence @xmath25 rather than the deflection field @xmath26 .",
    "we use @xmath27 which has an additional factor @xmath28 in the numerator compared to @xcite s definition .",
    "this makes the filter more sensitive to smaller scales , which is crucial for detecting cluster lensing , as will become obvious below .",
    "we further introduce @xmath29 and require that @xmath30 on average reproduce the convergence , @xmath31 . using @xmath32 , a straightforward calculation shows that this can be achieved choosing @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "aiming at the convergence , this normalisation has an additional factor @xmath35 compared to the normalisation required for filtering for the potential .",
    "again , this modification turns out to be crucial for the success of filtering cluster signals .",
    "the convergence falls off more steeply than the deflection field , which greatly simplifies the application of fast - fourier methods .",
    "we now describe simulations of filtering the weak cluster - lensing signal from cmb observations . for the cosmological background model",

    "the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : un_cluster ] shows the cmb temperature map with overlaid iso - contours of the temperature distortion pattern caused by the lensing effect of the cluster .",
    "the characteristic dipole pattern is clearly visible .",
    "the right panel of the same figure shows the estimated cluster convergence .",
    "the grey - scale map has a linear scale , while the iso - contours are logarithmically spaced .",
    "the circle illustrates the virial radius of the cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig:1 ] illustrates the cluster profile reconstruction after a straightforward application of our filter .",
    "the input cluster , whose profile is plotted as the solid curve , is placed in front of 10 , 100 , and 1000 different realisations of the cmb .",
    "the filter is applied , and the radial profile of the convergence estimate @xmath76 is determined and averaged across the cluster sample . outside a few scale radii , the reconstructed profile flattens because the clusters disappear in the cmb . while approaching the input profile outside a few scale radii until the noise begins dominating , the reconstructed profile is evidently too flat in the core .",
    "this can be overcome by introducing a suitably weighted average , as we shall now describe .",
    "note that the reconstructed convergence shows a spurious elongation perpendicular to the local cmb gradient , which arises because lensing of the cmb by a cluster has no effect in this direction ( cf .",
    "eq .  [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "this degeneracy is thus characteristic for lensing of the cmb temperature anisotropy rather than the filtering technique applied .",
    "it could be broken only with some additional information , like lensing of the polarisation anisotropy .",
    "this suggests to determine the convergence profile not by a straight average in azimuthal bins , but after multiplying the observed map with a weight map @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the angle between the cmb gradient and the deflection field at the position @xmath7 , under the assumption that it has radial symmetry .",
    "this is exact for our axially - symmetric analytical cluster model , but it can also be applied to the general case of asymmetric clusters because the deviation of the deflection - angle direction from the radial symmetry is small even for substructured clusters . assuming therefore that the deflection - angle points towards the field centre , we have @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the radial unit vector . note that we have used the wiener - filtered temperature gradient @xmath81 introduced in eq .",

    "the profile is now accurately reproduced well into the cluster core .",
    "averaging over 100 clusters , the profile is detected out to approximately ten scale radii , or roughly twice the virial radius . ]    as in fig .",

    "well into the cluster core , the profile is now accurately reproduced .",
    "averaging over a sample of 100 clusters , the profile is detected out to approximately ten scale radii , roughly corresponding to two virial radii . in view of the persisting uncertainty of central cluster density profiles",
    ", it is promising that the slope of the core profile is accurately reproduced even from ten clusters only .",
    "clusters which happen to be superposed on extrema or saddle points of the cmb temperature contribute little or nothing to the average lensing signal .",
    "the weighting scheme introduced here takes this automatically into account by reducing their statistical weight according to the signal they contribute .",
    "the power of this filtering method is evident and opens a new technique for analysing data from the next - generation , high - resolution sub - millimetre observatories like alma .",
    "@xcite originally proposed his filter for recovering the deflection - field of the large - scale structure . in order to filter for clusters ,",
    "our modification ( [ eq:6 ] ) of the weight map @xmath18 is crucial because introducing the factor @xmath28 increases the filter s sensitivity on small scales . as fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows , the resulting effect is dramatic . while hu s filter certainly detects the cluster , but fails in recovering its profile , our modified filter faithfully reproduces the input profile over almost two orders of magnitude in the radius .",
    "as described , this non - linear filtering procedure was optimised for filtering out the uncorrelated gaussian noise , like the cmb itself , instrumental noise and residuals from foreground subtraction , but it turns out to be also quite powerful in filtering out the contribution from the ksz effect .",
    "the latter has a characteristic which could lead to future further improvements , as we shall clarify below .        in order to understand how the filtering procedure processes the ksz effect , we analysed a simulated map consisting only of the cmb and the ksz effect .",
    "the result is shown in the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : un_sz ] .",
    "the top - left panel shows the same realisation of the cmb lensed by a cluster , the bottom - left panel combines both top panels , and the difference between the bottom - right and top - right panels is displayed in the bottom - right panel .",
    "the ksz effect introduces an artefact in the recovered convergence field which has a maximum amplitude of only one tenth of the lensing signal and is characterised by a dipolar structure aligned with the cmb gradient , along which the lensing effect is also the strongest .",
    "azimuthally averaging the recovered convergence , and stacking many cluster fields with random intrinsic orientations of the cmb gradient , further suppresses the ksz signal in the lensing reconstruction .        the dipolar pattern in the recovered convergence is caused by the fact that the filter interprets the entire secondary anisotropy as a lensing signal , and mimics it with a hypothetical lens with two adjacent positive and negative convergence peaks .",
    "such a lens has a deflection - angle field reminiscent of an electric dipole , leading to a temperature signature identical to that of the ksz effect .",
    "this peculiarity of the characteristic ksz pattern could be used to further improve the filter including criteria for simultaneously minimising the ksz effect .",
    "figure  [ fig:3 ] illustrates the recovery of the cluster convergence profile in presence of the ksz effect .",
    "both curves with error bars were obtained placing the same cluster in front of 100 cmb realisations each and determining the weighted convergence profile as before .",
    "evidently , the ksz effect does not affect the lensing reconstruction in any significant way .",
    "summarising this section , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] the relative deviation of the reconstructed cluster convergence profiles for three samples of 100 clusters each , without and with weighting the average , and without and with the ksz effect included .",
    "employing the weighted average , the recovered convergence is accurate to better than ten per cent near the scale radius , irrespective of the ksz effect .      for this section",
    ", we simulated gaussian cmb maps , including the lensing and the ksz signal of clusters detectable through their tsz effect , and also including the instrumental effects as explained in sect .",
    "[ sec : simulation ] .",
    "we set the noise level to @xmath87 , and convolved the maps with a gaussian beam with @xmath0 fwhm in order to investigate the expectations for estimating the average cluster convergence profile using data from the 225-ghz _ act _ channel .",
    "we model the distribution of galaxy clusters in mass and redshift according to the mass function proposed by @xcite .",
    "since galaxy clusters are detected through their tsz effect at millimetre and sub - millimetre wavelengths , we truncate the cluster distribution where the solid - angle integrated compton parameter @xmath60 falls below a threshold @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the instrumental sensitivity expressed in relative antenna temperature fluctuations , and @xmath90 is the effective solid - angle of the beam @xcite . we choose @xmath91 to approximate the sensitivity of the 225  ghz channel on _ act _ of @xmath92 and an angular resolution of @xmath0 .",
    "we model the cluster distribution in the mass range from @xmath93 to @xmath74 between redshifts @xmath94 and @xmath95 , obtaining in total @xmath96 clusters .",

    "we apply the described technique to sets of cmb maps lensed by a cluster and superposed with the ksz effect and instrumental noise , then compute the final weighted average convergence with the weight described in eq .",

    "the sharp lower cut - off in the mass shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster_distrib ] , and the exponential upper cut - off due to the steep cluster mass function , leads to a very sharp peak in the distribution of clusters detectable for act ( cf .",
    "[ fig : mass_distrib ] ) . also , the redshift distribution of the act cluster sample peaks near redshift unity , where the angular - diameter distance is almost independent of redshift .",
    "averaging cluster profiles across the entire act sample is thus not expected to smooth the resulting profile by more than the beam smoothing .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : act_result ] .",
    "parameter falls within @xmath100 . ]",
    "lacking information other than that derived from the tsz effect , subsamples may be defined by imposing thresholds on the integrated compton-@xmath60 parameter . as an example , we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : subsample ] the unweighted mean profile of those clusters detected by act which have @xmath101 . while the sample is now much better defined , the error bars increase considerably because of the much reduced number of clusters ( 2300 instead of 25000 ) .",
    "the instrumental resolution of @xmath0 is not small compared to the cluster size .",
    "thus , most information is contained within a few resolution elements .",
    "this is evident in the reconstructed profiles of figs .",
    "[ fig : act_result ] and [ fig : subsample ] , where the measured points fall below the input profile within @xmath0 , but well on the curve at larger radii .",
    "this implies that cluster mass estimates will suffer from the low resolution .",
    "the mean cluster mass determined from the mean convergence profile is typically a factor of two below the true mass of the input clusters .",
    "the lensing convergence can be converted to mass assuming a source redshift of @xmath102 , and adopting the mean redshift of the act clusters for the lens redshift .",
    "starting from a non - linear filter proposed by @xcite for recovering the deflection - angle field of the large - scale structure from cmb temperature fluctuations , we have constructed a non - linear filter for extracting cluster - lensing signals from cmb maps . on the angular scales of galaxy clusters ,",
    "the cmb is almost feature - less and can approximately be represented as a temperature gradient .",
    "cluster lensing imprints a characteristic pattern on that gradient , which can be filtered for .",
    "since the signal obtained from a single cluster field will be weak , current instrumentation requires stacking many cluster fields in order to enhance the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "future instruments like alma may allow the lensing signal of individual clusters to be detected .",
    "linear filtering would produce a signal aligned with the cmb gradient , so that the signal would be removed when averaging over cluster samples .",
    "although other solutions are possible , this argues for a non - linear filter which effectively squares the signal .",
    "@xcite suggested to first take the wiener - filtered temperature gradient , high - pass filter it in order to remove large - scale noise , take the divergence of the filtered gradient and normalise it such as to be proportional to the deflection - angle field . in order to detect small - scale cluster - lensing signals",
    ", we suggest to modify this procedure by shifting the high - pass filter to even higher frequencies , and to normalise the procedure such that the lensing surface - mass density , or convergence , will be recovered instead of the deflection - angle field .",
    "this has the further advantage of decaying much more rapidly away from cluster cores , which helps in applying fast - fourier techniques .",
    "we tested this non - linear filter under various assumptions .",
    "first , we showed that cluster convergence profiles are reasonably recovered from stacked cluster fields .",
    "azimuthally averaging cluster fields , and averaging the resulting profiles , reproduces the input cluster convergence profile quite well , but the recovered profiles are too shallow in the core .    as the reason for that deviation , we identified the fact that the lensing signal is weak or absent in directions approximately perpendicular to the cmb temperature gradient .",
    "we thus introduced a weighting scheme for each individual cluster field which quantifies the alignment of the lensing deflection with the cmb gradient , and down - weights the signal in proportion to the cosine of the angle between the lensing deflection and the temperature gradient .",
    "directions perpendicular to the temperature gradient and flat areas in the temperature map , along which and where the lensing signal vanishes , are thus effectively removed .",
    "weighting the average of the recovered cluster profiles in that way substantially improves the agreement with the input profile .",
    "we found that an average over 100 cluster fields excellently recovers the mean cluster profile out to several scale radii , and detects it significantly beyond the virial cluster radius .",
    "this filter is best applied on data taken at frequencies near 217  ghz in order to suppress noise introduced by the tsz effect .",
    "the ksz effect , however , can not be avoided in that way . from the point of view of gravitational lensing",
    ", the ksz effect can be mimicked by a dipolar lens consisting of a positive and a negative mass contribution .",
    "filtering lensed cmb data including the ksz effect thus adds a further source of noise to the recovered density profile .",
    "including that in our simulations , we found however that the ksz effect affects the results by a negligibly small amount .",
    "the three main reasons for that are that the specific dipolar signature of the ksz effect tends to average away by stacking cluster fields , that mean radial cluster velocities also average to zero across a cluster sample , and that the spurious lensing signal produced by the ksz effect is approximately one order of magnitude below the true lensing signal .",
    "finally , we tested what can be expected from filtering the data to be obtained from the _ atacama cosmology telescope _ ( act ) for cluster lensing .",
    "given act s angular resolution of @xmath0 , cluster lensing signals can only be detected in the innermost resolution elements surrounding the cluster cores .",
    "it will thus only be possible to recover mean cluster convergence profiles outside of @xmath0 , and mean cluster masses will be underestimated .",
    "those simulations took the instrumental noise expected for act s 225-ghz detector into account .",
    "these results are particularly encouraging in view of upcoming wide - field sub - mm surveys to be carried out with telescopes like apex and alma .",
    "it appears realistic that non - linear filtering will allow mean cluster convergence profiles to be reliably recovered from their gravitational - lensing signature ."
