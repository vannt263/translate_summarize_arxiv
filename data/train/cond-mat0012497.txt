    "in financial markets , the time interval between two consecutive transactions ( the so called _ waiting time _ ) varies stochastically .",
    "there have been various studies on the nature of the stochastic processes generating the sequences of waiting times between two consecutive trades @xcite . in two recent papers , scalas @xcite and mainardi",
    "@xcite proposed the continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) model @xcite as a phenomenological description of tick - by - tick dynamics in financial markets . in the hydrodynamic limit",
    ", the model yields a general scaling form @xcite for the probability density function of finding the log - price @xmath0 at time @xmath1 .",
    "scaling is a consequence of the equivalence between ctrws and fractional diffusion equations @xcite .",
    "the reader can also consult refs @xcite . here , as in @xcite",
    ", we will not focus our attention on scaling , but on a different property : the waiting - time distribution .",
    "this paper is divided as follows .",
    "section 2 provides a brief summary of the theoretical framework of ctrw . in section",
    "3 ctrw assumptions are tested on market data .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath0 the logarithm of an asset price .",
    "we assume that both the log - price jumps @xmath2 and the waiting times between two consecutive trades @xmath3 are i.i.d .",
    "stochastic variables .",
    "we also assume that these variables are characterized by the two probability density functions : @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that the evolution equation for @xmath6 , the probability of having the log - price @xmath0 at time @xmath1 , can be written as follows @xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a suitable memory kernel related in laplace space to @xmath9 - the probability that a given waiting interval is greater or equal to @xmath10 - by :    @xmath11    in its turn , the probability @xmath12 is given by :    @xmath13    the probability @xmath9 can be estimated from empirical data , and can thus be used to test hypotheses on the memory kernel @xmath8 . in particular , if @xmath14 exhibits a power - law time decay @xmath15 with @xmath16 one can show that @xcite :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is the mittag - leffler function of order @xmath19 . in the following , we shall discuss this particular hypothesis .",
    "we examined the waiting - time distribution of btp futures traded at liffe in 1997 . throughout the year",
    ", there were four future contracts on btp bonds , depending on delivery dates : march , june , september , or december .",
    "we considered two delivery dates : june ( figure 1 ) and september ( figure 2 ) .",
    "usually , for a future with a certain maturity , transactions begin some months before the delivery date . at the beginning , there are few trades a day , but closer to the delivery there may be more than 1000 transactions a day .",
    "the total number of transactions was about 140,000 for the delivery date of june and 170,000 for september .",
    "figure 1 shows a comparison between the function @xmath9 estimated for the empirical waiting times and two theoretical functions .",
    "the circles refer to market data ( delivery date of june 1997 ) and represent the probability of a waiting time greater than the abscissa @xmath10 .",
    "we have determined 494 values of @xmath9 for @xmath10 in a interval between 1 @xmath20 and about 50,000 @xmath20 , neglecting the intervals of market closure .",
    "the solid line is a two - parameter fit obtained by using the mittag - leffler type function :    @xmath21\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath19 is the index of the mittag - leffler function and @xmath22 is a time - scale factor , depending on the time unit .",
    "we get an index @xmath23 and a scale factor @xmath24 the fit of figure 1 has a reduced chi - square @xmath25 the chi - square values have been computed considering all the 494 values .",
    "the dash - dotted line represents the stretched exponential function @xmath26 , whereas the dashed line is the power law function @xmath27 .",
    "the mittag - leffler function interpolates between these two limiting behaviours : the stretched exponential for small time intervals , and the power law for large ones .",
    "figure 2 shows the results for the delivery date of september 1997 . in this case",
    ", we have 442 values of @xmath9 for @xmath10 in the interval between 1 @xmath20 and about 50,000 @xmath20 ; as for data in figure 1 , we get @xmath23 and @xmath28 ; the reduced chi - square , computed considering all the 442 values , is @xmath29 .     and scale factor @xmath30 is compared to the stretched exponential ( dash - dotted line ) and the power ( dashed line ) functions.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]     and scale factor @xmath30 is compared with the stretched exponential ( dash - dotted line ) and the power ( dashed line ) functions.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]",
    "figures 1,2 and the preliminary empirical analysis provided in @xcite show a satisfactory agreement between the empirical distributions of market data and theoretical predictions drawn from the ctrw hypothesis with additional assumptions .",
    "ctrw is thus likely to be a reasonable phenomenological description of the tick - by - tick dynamics for a financial market , as it also takes into account both the non - markovian and the non - local characters of the time evolution in financial time series .",
    "the fitting procedure used in this paper differs from that in @xcite .",
    "indeed we found the estimate of the function @xmath9 and the fitting procedures far from trivial .",
    "these points deserve a separate and thorough discussion which will be the subject of a future paper .",
