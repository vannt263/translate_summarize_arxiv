    "a future linear collider ( lc ) designed with high luminosity of about @xmath1@xmath2s@xmath3 at @xmath4  gev and @xmath5@xmath2s@xmath3 at @xmath6  gev will provide precision studies in the energy range between lep and the tev range @xcite . concerning the searches for new physics it complements and extends the physics program of the hadron colliders , tevatron and the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) .",
    "the lc has large potential for the discovery of new particles and is unique concerning the precision analysis of new physics ( np ) as well as of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .",
    "an important tool of a lc is the use of polarized beams @xcite .",
    "already in the base line design it is foreseen to use the electron beams polarized to around @xmath7 via a strained photocathode technology . in order to generate",
    "also polarized positrons the use of a helical undulator is favoured , producing polarized photons which generate via pair production polarized positrons of about 40% ( with full intensity of the @xmath8 beam ) to 60% ( with 55% intensity ) .    in the next sections we summarize the new physics searches at a lc starting from high precision studies of the sm as a motivation .",
    "one possibility to see hints for new physics , even if new particles are not yet found , are electroweak precision tests with an unprecedented accuracy .",
    "the study of triple gauge couplings is very promising . in @xcite",
    "a method has been worked out to derive complete analytical expressions for the spin polarization and alignment of the @xmath10 boson in @xmath9 including the contributions from @xmath11 and @xmath12 anomalous couplings .",
    "searches for deviations from the sm have already been studied , comparing polarized cross sections in a general parametrization including anomalous gauge couplings with expected precision measurements at the lc @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for this purpose the polarization of the beams is very powerful : e.g. the polarization of @xmath14 ( together with @xmath15 ) improves the sensitivity up to a factor 1.8 ( 2.5 ) .      a promising possibility to study",
    "electroweak symmetry breaking is the use of transversely polarized @xmath0 beams which projects out @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry with respect to the azimuthal angle of this process focusses on the @xmath18 mode .",
    "this asymmetry is very pronounced at high energies reaching about @xmath19 .",
    "the advantage of this observable is that at high energies this asymmetry peaks at larger angles and not in beam direction where the analysis might be difficult .",
    "one has to note , however , that for the use of transverse beams the polarization of both beams is needed .",
    "the effect does not occur if only one beam is polarized since the cross section is given by : @xmath20      a very spectacular method for probing the sm is foreseen as an upgrade of a lc : the gigaz option . here @xmath21 is studied at the pole with very high luminosity of about @xmath22 z s within three month . with this option",
    "the effective electroweak leptonic mixing angle can be measured via the left ",
    "right asymmetry of this process with an unprecedented accuracy , see table  [ tab_prec ] @xcite .      in @xcite",
    "electroweak dipole form factors of the @xmath23 lepton have been analysed with regard to cp violation .",
    "odd triple product correlations have been studied and sensitivity bounds for the real and imaginary parts of these form factors have been set .",
    "using polarized beams a lc could be sensitive to these form factors up to @xmath24  ecm .",
    "supersymmetry is widely regarded as the best motivated extension of the sm . however , since the sm particles and their susy partners are not mass degenerate , susy has to be broken , which leads even for its minimal version , the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , to about 100 free parameters . in specific scenarios of susy breaking one has much less parameters : 5 in msugra , 4 in amsb and 5 in gmsb .    in order to exactly pin down the structure of the underlying model it is unavoidable to extract the parameters without assuming a particular breaking scheme .",
    "the lc with its clear signatures is well suited to determine the general parameters with high precision and to test fundamental susy assumptions as e.g. the equality of quantum numbers or of couplings of the particles and their susy partners .",
    "it turns out that the use of polarized beams plays a decisive role in this context .      as demonstrated in tdr the mass and the mixing angle of @xmath26",
    "can be extracted with high precision via the study of polarized cross sections for light stop production . at a high luminosity lc and with @xmath27 and @xmath28 an accuracy of @xmath29  gev and @xmath30 could be reachable .",
    "susy transformations associate @xmath32 and the antiparticles @xmath33 .",
    "in order to prove this association of scalar particles to chiral quantum numbers the use of polarized beams is necessary @xcite .",
    "the process occurs via @xmath34 and @xmath10 exchange in the s  channel and via @xmath35 exchange in the t  channel . only in the t ",
    "channel the sm particle is directly coupled to its scalar partner and in order to test the association of quantum numbers one has to projects out the t  channel exchange .    with completely polarized @xmath36",
    "only @xmath37 contributes . due to their @xmath38 coupling character @xmath39",
    ", @xmath40 can be discriminated via their decays and can be identified via their charge .",
    "one has to note that a polarized @xmath8 beam is necessary .",
    "even completely polarized @xmath41 would not be sufficient , since otherwise the s - channel exchange could not be switched off . in reality partially polarized beams of @xmath42 and @xmath43 can be sufficient to probe this association . with this polarization",
    "@xmath44 dominates e.g. by a factor of 3 , fig .",
    "[ fig_sel ] .      in @xcite and references therein a strategy has been worked out to determine accurately the mssm parameters @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and moderate @xmath50 via the study of polarized rates in @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "even if only @xmath53 , @xmath54 were accessible , it would be sufficient for determining the mssm parameters @xcite . with light chargino pair production and polarized initial beams one can unambiguously determine the mixing angle but @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath50",
    "still depend on @xmath55 .",
    "if one furthermore includes now the light neutralino system and studies the polarized cross sections @xmath56 in the complex @xmath45 plane , one can simultaneously determine the parameter @xmath45 and predict @xmath55 .",
    "once the parameters are determined one can efficiently test whether the gauge couplings @xmath57 and @xmath58 are identical to the yukawa couplings @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively , by studying the polarized cross sections with a variable ratio of @xmath61 and @xmath62 and comparing it with experimental values @xcite .      in case of high @xmath63",
    "the chargino and neutralino sector is insensitive to this parameter .",
    "however , one could then determine @xmath50 from another sector whose particles are relatively light in many scenarios : the @xmath64 sector .",
    "the polarization of @xmath23 s from @xmath65 is sensitive to @xmath50 . in case of a sufficient higgsino admixture in the @xmath66",
    "it is even possible to determine high @xmath50 as well as @xmath67 , without any assumptions on the susy breaking mechanism @xcite : after determining the @xmath64 mixing angle via the polarization asymmetry @xmath68 in @xmath69 , one can determine @xmath50 from the @xmath23 polarization in the decay @xmath70 , see fig.[fig_stau ] . even for high @xmath71",
    "one can reach an accuracy of about @xmath19 .",
    "measuring now @xmath72 leads to the determination of @xmath67 .      in the @xmath73 system cp  violating phases can occur in the parameters @xmath67 , @xmath48 and @xmath45 .",
    "these phases have a decisive influence on masses , couplings and various cp  violating observables .",
    "the influence of the phases could be quite strong even on cp  conserving decay branching ratios ( br s ) and hence one should take it into account when determining the mssm parameters at the lhc and lc . in this context",
    "the br s also might be a sensitive probe for the cp ",
    "phases @xcite .      in case of r",
    " parity violating susy non  standard couplings could occur which produce a scalar particle in the s  channel : @xmath74 .",
    "the process gives a significant signal over the background .",
    "since it requires both left  handed @xmath41 and @xmath8 beams , it can be easily analysed and identified by the use of beam polarization ( @xcite and references therein ) : here simultaneously polarized beams enhance the signal by about a factor of 10 .",
    "+ introducing in the mssm an additional higgs singlet leads to the ( m+1)ssm with one additional neutralino . since the mass spectra of the four light neutralinos could be similar to those in the mssm a distinction between the models",
    "might be difficult via spectra and rates alone .",
    "however , polarization effects might then indicate the different coupling structure in the ( m+1)ssm @xcite .",
    "another approach to resolve the hierachy problem is the introduction of large extra dimensions . at a lc",
    "the process @xmath75 is promising and it has been worked out that running on two different @xmath76 one can determine the number of extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "the use of polarized beams in this context enlarges on one hand the sensitivity to the new scale @xmath77 and suppresses on the other hand the main background @xmath78 significantly .",
    "the ratio @xmath79 is enhanced by a factor of about 2.1 ( 4.4 ) if @xmath80 ( and @xmath81 ) is used .",
    "it has been shown that a lc in the tev range is well suited for new physics searches and in particular for its precise determination .",
    "the use of polarized beams plays a decisive role . in this context the use of simultaneously polarized @xmath41 , @xmath8 beams has several advantages : enhancing considerably the accuracy for sm precision tests at gigaz , providing higher sensitivity to non  standard couplings and supplying efficient tools to identify quantum numbers of the new particles and to determine the underlying parameters of the theory .",
