    "projected emittances are quantities which are used to characterize transverse and longitudinal beam dimensions in the laboratory coordinate system and are invariants under linear uncoupled ( with respect to the laboratory coordinate system ) symplectic transport .",
    "eigenemittances are quantities which give beam dimensions in the coordinate frame in which the beam matrix is uncoupled between degrees of freedom and are invariants under arbitrary ( possibly coupled ) linear symplectic transformations .",
    "if the beam matrix is uncoupled already in the laboratory frame , then the set of projected emittances coincides with the set of eigenemittances , and if the beam matrix has correlations between different degrees of freedom , then these two sets are different . this fact , though looking simple , has interesting applications in accelerator physics and gives the theoretical basis for the round - to - flat transformation of angular momentum dominated beams invented by derbenev  @xcite . in his scheme",
    "the beam with equal transverse projected emittances ( round beam ) but with nonequal eigenemittances is first produced in an axial magnetic field .",
    "then the correlations in the beam matrix are removed by a downstream set of skew quadrupoles and projected emittances become equal to the eigenemittances , which means that the beam transverse dimensions become different from each other .",
    "this work and further development of the advanced emittance manipulation techniques ( see , for example @xcite and references therein ) naturally raise the following question : what are the relations between projected emittances and eigenemittances ?",
    "as concerning already known results , in general situation they are limited to the so - called classical uncertainty principle , which states that none of projected emittances can be smaller than the minimal eigenemittance ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . besides that , in the specific two degrees of freedom case , a number of useful results can be found in  @xcite .    the purpose of this article is to give the necessary and sufficient conditions which two sets of positive real numbers must satisfy in two and three degrees of freedom cases in order to be realizable as eigenemittances and projected emittances of a beam matrix .",
    "let us consider a collection of points in @xmath0-dimensional phase space ( a particle beam ) and let , for each particle ,    @xmath1    be a vector of canonical coordinates @xmath2 and momenta @xmath3 . then , as usual , the beam ( covariance ) matrix is defined as    @xmath4    where the brackets @xmath5 denote an average over a distribution of the particles in the beam . by definition ,",
    "the beam matrix @xmath6 is symmetric positive semidefinite and in the following we will restrict our considerations to the situation when this matrix is nondegenerated and therefore positive definite . for simplification of notations and without loss of generality",
    ", we will also assume that the beam has vanishing first - order moments , i.e. @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be the independent variable and let @xmath9 be the nondegenerated matrix which propagates particle coordinates from the state @xmath10 to the state @xmath11 , i.e let    @xmath12    then from ( [ intr_2 ] ) and ( [ intr_4 ] ) it follows that the matrix @xmath6 evolves between these two states according to the congruence    @xmath13    let us write the @xmath14 matrix @xmath6 in block - matrix form    @xmath15    where the entries @xmath16 are @xmath17 matrices . because @xmath6 is symmetric , the blocks satisfy the relations @xmath18 for all @xmath19 .",
    "one says that the beam matrix @xmath6 is uncoupled if all its @xmath17 blocks @xmath16 with @xmath20 are equal to zero , and one says that the @xmath21-th degree of freedom in the beam matrix @xmath6 is decoupled from the others if @xmath22 for all @xmath23 .",
    "if , similar to the matrix @xmath6 , we will partition the matrix @xmath24 into submatrices @xmath25 , then one can rewrite the transport equation ( [ intr_5 ] ) in the form of a system involving only @xmath17 submatrices of the matrices @xmath6 and @xmath24    @xmath26    in analogy with the matrix @xmath6 , one says that the transport matrix @xmath24 is uncoupled if all its blocks @xmath25 with @xmath20 are equal to zero , and one says that the @xmath21-th degree of freedom in the transport matrix @xmath24 is decoupled from the others if @xmath27 for all @xmath23 .    in the following",
    "we will assume that the beam transport matrix @xmath24 is symplectic , which is equivalent to say that it satisfies the relations    @xmath28    where    @xmath29    is the @xmath14 symplectic unit matrix .",
    "and @xmath30 of a @xmath31 beam matrix @xmath6 with fixed eigenemittances @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "if @xmath34 , then the shaded half - strip turns into a ray ( half - line).,width=283 ]    using partitioning into @xmath17 submatrices the two ( equivalent ) conditions for the matrix @xmath24 to be symplectic ( [ intr_8 ] ) can be rewritten in the form of the following set of equations :    @xmath35    where @xmath19 and @xmath36 is kronecker s delta .    because for an arbitrary @xmath17 matrix @xmath37    @xmath38    the equations ( [ intr_9 ] ) give us the following important identities    @xmath39    which are valid for all @xmath40 .",

    "then from equations ( [ intr_18 ] ) one obtains that    @xmath44    and because due to ( [ intr_11 ] ) the submatrix @xmath45 has unit determinant , we see that the projected emittance @xmath41 is conserved during the beam transport independently if the @xmath21-th degree of freedom in the matrix @xmath46 is decoupled from the others or not .",

    "the matrix @xmath54 is nondegenerated and is similar to the skew symmetric matrix @xmath55    @xmath56    which means that its spectrum is of the form    @xmath57    where all @xmath58 and @xmath59 is the imaginary unit .",
    "the quantities @xmath60 are called eigenemittances and generalize the property of the projected emittances to be invariants of uncoupled beam transport to the fully coupled case  @xcite .",
    "the other approach to the concept of eigenemittances is the way pointed out by williamson s theorem ( see , for example , references in  @xcite ) .",
    "this theorem tells us that one can diagonalize any positive definite symmetric matrix @xmath6 by congruence using a symplectic matrix @xmath61    @xmath62    and that the diagonal matrix @xmath63 has the very simple form    @xmath64    where the diagonal elements @xmath60 are the moduli of the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath54 .",

    "[ fig3 ]    it is clear that not only eigenemittances themselves , but also an arbitrary function of them is an invariant . in particular , in the following we will make use of invariants    @xmath65 / 2   = \\epsilon_1^{2 m } + \\ldots + \\epsilon_n^{2m}. \\label{dd_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "in this section we summarize what it is possible to say about beam matrix and its emittances in the arbitrary degrees of freedom case . note that not all presented relations are new .",
    "for example , the inequality ( [ prop2_1 ] ) is the well known classical uncertainty principle .",
    "let @xmath6 be a @xmath14 beam matrix and let positive real numbers @xmath66 and @xmath67 be its eigenemittances and projected emittances , respectively .",
