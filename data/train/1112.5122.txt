    "for a long time , the understanding of the scalar sector of mesons has been problematic and still a subject of debate .",
    "the low energy scalar states , for instance the @xmath4 and @xmath0 ( @xmath5 ) have been considered in the past conventional quark - antiquark mesons @xcite , tetraquarks @xcite , hadron molecules @xcite , glueballs and hybrids @xcite .",
    "in addition , for scalar mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 there is yet no consensus on their status @xcite .",
    "such a confuse interpretation comes from the fact that despite the qcd providing a clear description of the strong interaction of partons ( quarks / gluons ) at high energies , the situation is complex in the low energy regime .",
    "namely , obtaining quantitative predictions from qcd at low energy , like the spectrum of baryons and mesons , remains challenging and nowadays relies on numerical techniques of lattice qcd ( lqcd ) .",
    "the current understanding of how quarks form mesons has evolved within qcd and it is expected a richer spectrum of mesons that takes into account not only the quark degrees of freedom but also the gluonic ones .",
    "a common example are the glueball resonance with no quarks which are expected to have quantum numbers not exotic and can not be accommodated within quark - antiquark nonets @xcite .",
    "this glueball states can mix with quark - antiquark states with the same quantum numbers .",
    "we also expect that excitations of the gluonic field from the quark binding could generate the so - called hybrid mesons , which are a quark - antiquark state plus a one or more gluonic degree of freedom .",
    "thus , the exotic mesons provide the ideal laboratory for testing qcd in the confinement regime once they explicitly manifest the gluonic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the mesons @xmath1 and @xmath2 are considered good candidates for the scalar glueball @xcite . however , in this mass region , the glueball state will mix strongly with nearby @xmath6 states @xcite . in the lowest order ,",
    "mixture of the scalar glueball @xmath7 and quarkonia states @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be obtained as in refs .",
    "the mixing is write in the following form @xmath10 , where the normalization condition is @xmath11 . in the literature",
    "the parameters have been adjusted to the observed resonances @xmath12 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 and are obtained from the mass of the glueball , @xmath13 and @xmath9 states @xcite . the unknown about the mixing parameters still remains , on this way some proposal to set the parameters is very important to determine the structure of this resonances .    despite an active experimental program , data supporting the existence of meson states having exotic quantum numbers are still sparse @xcite . concerning the scalar sector , the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are possibilities for the ninth member of the su(3 ) flavor nonet @xcite .",
    "it is in general assumed the surplus of isoscalar scalar in the mass region 1300 - 1700 mev is due to the presence of a scalar glueball , which was supported by calculation on quenched lqcd @xcite .",
    "those meson were the viewed as mixed quark - antiquark and gluonium states .",
    "the interpretation has changed when considering unquenched lqcd calculations @xcite . as an alternative",
    "the radiative transitions could offer a means of probing the structure of hadrons as the coupling to the charges and spins of the constituents reveals detailed information about the wavefunctions and could discriminate among models .",
    "radiative decays of @xmath14 mesons to @xmath15 and @xmath16 have been shown to provide effective probes of their structure . if the @xmath14 mesons are mixed states their radiative decays to a vector mesons are strongly affected by the degree of mixing between the @xmath6 state and the glueball @xcite . following @xcite , assuming that the @xmath6 contribution to the referred mesons is in the @xmath17 nonet , the discrimination among different mixing possibilities is strong .    in the context referred above , the photoproduction of exotic @xcite is interesting for several reasons . using arguments based on vector meson dominance ( vdm ) the photon can behave like an @xmath18 quark - antiquark system . in several models , such a system is more likely to couple to exotic quantum number hybrids . recently",
    ", lqcd calculations have been performed to compute the radiative decay of charmonium and hybrid states @xcite , verifying a large radiative decay for an exotic quantum number hybrid . based on these results in the charmonium sector",
    ", photoproduction appears to be a good place to look for hybrid mesons . in particular",
    ", the photoproduction of scalar mesons at intermediate energies could provide an alternative to the direct observation of the radiative decays . from the experimental point of view",
    ", the gluex experiment @xcite is being installed and it is located in jlab accelerator . its primary purpose is to understand the nature of confinement in qcd by mapping the spectrum of exotic mesons generated buy the excitation of the gluonic field binding the quarks",
    ". the experiment will be able to probe new areas by using photoproduction to produce exotic states .    here",
    ", we will focus on photoproduction of mesons states @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath2 mesons will be considered distinct in distinct mixing possibilities and assuming that @xmath0 is member of the ground - state nonet .",
    "this is an established idea although the motivation is different from some other works in the literature , e.g. ref .",
    "the theoretical formalism employed is the regge approach with reggeized @xmath15 and @xmath16 exchange @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in next section we present the main expressions for scattering amplitudes and cross section calculation of scalar meson photoproduction in the regge theory and in last section we shown the numerical results discussing distinct mixing scenarios and main conclusions .",

    "the differential cross sections for @xmath64 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] at @xmath3 gev , and showing the consequences of distinct mixing scenarios .",
    "the general structure follows the previous figure . in the scenario ( i )",
    "the cross section is higher the other scenarios .",
    "that is , a light glueball mass implies a larger cross section for the @xmath64 mesons . on the other hand ,",
    "the inverse situation occurs for the @xmath2 mesons as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] where the large cross section comes from the heavy glueball mass component .",
    "the cross sections reflect directly the radiative decay widths as can be verified from simple inspection of table 1 .",
    "it was advocated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the ratios of cross sections could give the `` weigh '' of the glueball content . for completeness",
    ", the integrated cross sections for photoproduction of the scalars on protons at @xmath65 = 9 gev are given in table 2 for light ( i ) , medium ( ii ) and heavy ( iii ) glueball masses .",
    "for @xmath0 the total cross section is @xmath66 nb .            concerning the background coming from the decay of vector mesons into two charged mesons it can be get rid by considering only the all - neutral channels .",
    "namely , the two neutral pions , two neutral @xmath68 s and four neutral pions decays of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "an additional problem is the uncertainty in the branching fractions of the @xmath2 @xcite and its small cross section . on the other hand ,",
    "the cross sections for photoproduction of the @xmath1 on protons are reasonable and its branching fractions are much better defined .",
    "still about background , the scalars are not produced alone as in the @xmath21 channel there is a continuum background arising from the process of decay of photon in a neutral pion plus a vector meson like rho or omega with subsequent rescattering of the latter on the proton by @xmath69 exchange to give the second @xmath70 .",
    "this has to be taken into account in a realistic simulation of final state configuration as done in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the photoproduction of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances for photon energies relevant for the gluex experiment at photon energy of 9 gev .",
    "it would provide novel tests for our understanding of the nature of the scalar resonances and about current ideas on glueball and @xmath6 mixing .",
    "the meson differential and integrated cross sections were evaluated and the effect of distinct mixing scenarios were investigated .",
    "although large backgrounds are expected , the signals could be visible by considering only the all - neutral channels , that is their decays on @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the theoretical uncertainties are still large , with @xmath1 the more optimistic case .",
    "finally , an experiment in nuclei would also lead to the @xmath14 and @xmath71 excitation mostly from the collision of protons with protons .",
    "the studies in nuclei would provide information on the meson properties in a nuclear medium , where large modifications are theoretically expected @xcite . as a final note on the limitations of the present model , the narrow width approximation for the scalars could be insufficient taking into account that the final - state measured particles would be for instance @xmath72 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and",
    "the energy - dependent width effects would become significant ."
