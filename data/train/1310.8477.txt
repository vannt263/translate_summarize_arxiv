    "since the measurements of cosmic rays have reached energies of the gzk  @xcite , the main challenge for the physics of ultra - high cosmic rays is to increase the statistics and the measurement quality close to the breakdown of the cosmic ray flux at approximate 60 eev . to obtain a sufficient statistics we need to build economically reasonable large - area detectors with high duty cycle .",
    "the radio detection could be one of the perspective techniques for future investigations of ultra - high energy cosmic rays .",
    "radio emission from extensive air showers was theoretically predicted  @xcite and first detected  @xcite about 50  years ago .",
    "the radio detection techniques became popular in the last decade again , because standard detection methods have reached technological and economical limits : measurements by surface particle detectors depend on models , whose accuracy is limited at high energies due to extrapolation ; optical fluorescence and air - cherenkov detectors are limited by their duty cycle due to duration of dark nights and weather .",
    "thus , a number of modern experiments  @xcite aims at obtaining the main properties of extensive air showers , such as arrival direction , energy , shower maximum and primary particle using the radio detection technique .",
    "these experiments proved that the radio emission can be detected from air showers with energies above @xmath3  ev , with an angular resolution for the arrival direction better than @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the open question is the precision of the reconstruction for primary energy and shower maximum . up to now",
    ", the experiments have given only upper limits for these quantities ( @xmath5 for the energy and about @xmath6g / cm^2^ for @xmath7 )  @xcite . in a very recent report from the experiment lofar",
    ", it was estimated that a precision of the @xmath8 reconstruction can reach up to @xmath9 g / cm@xmath2  @xcite .",
    "this precision would be comparable with the fluorescence technique .",
    "the current challenge is to reach a competitive precision with an economic radio array which can be scaled to very large areas .",
    "the main goal of tunka - rex , the radio extension of the tunka observatory for air showers , is to answer this question , i.e. , to determine the precision for the reconstruction of the energy and the atmospheric depth of the shower maximum based on the cross - calibration with a air - cherenkov detector . for this purpose , tunka - rex",
    "is built within the tunka-133 photomultiplier ( pmt ) array .",
    "the latter is measuring the air - cherenkov light of air showers in the energy range between @xmath0 and @xmath11ev @xcite .",
    "data of both detectors are recorded by a shared data - acquisition system , and the radio antennas are triggered by the photomultiplier measurements .",
    "this setup automatically provides hybrid measurements of the radio and the air - cherenkov signal , and consequently allows us to perform a cross - calibration of both techniques .",
    "in particular , we can test the sensitivity of the tunka - rex radio measurements for the energy and for @xmath7 by comparing them to the measurements of the established air - cherenkov array .",
    "tunka - rex currently consists of 20 antennas attached by cables to the cluster centers of the tunka-133 photomultiplier array ( fig .",
    "[ fig_map ] ) , which is organized in 25 clusters formed by 7 pmts each .",
    "the spacing between the antennas in the inner clusters is approximately @xmath12 m , covering an area of roughly @xmath13km^2^. at each antenna position there are two orthogonally aligned sallas ( short aperiodic loaded loop antenna ) @xcite with 120  cm diameter ( fig .",
    "[ fig - salla ] ) .        unlike most radio experiments the antennas in tunka - rex",
    "are not aligned along the north - south and east - west axis , but rotated by 45@xmath14 , like in lofar @xcite .",
    "since the radio signal from cosmic ray air showers is predominantly east - west polarized @xcite , this should result in more antennas with signal in both channels but also less events with signal in at least one channel .",
    "the salla has been chosen as antenna not only for economic reasons , but also because its properties depend only little on environmental conditions , particularly , the influence of the ground on the antenna gain and , thus , the measurement accuracy , is suppressed by a load attached to the bottom part of the antenna .",
    "the signal chain is continued by a low noise amplifier ( lna ) placed in the isolated metal box , connected directly to the top of the salla ; a buried coaxial cable connecting the antenna to the main amplifier and a filter at each cluster center of tunka-133 hosting a flash adc board for the digital data acquisition ( fig .  [ chain ] ) .",
    "tunka - rex is triggered by the photomultipliers and records the radio signal from the air showers between @xmath15 and @xmath16mhz , where the signal outside of this band is suppressed with an analog filter ( fig .",
    "[ fig - spectrum ] ) .",
    "first , this improves the signal - to - noise ratio of the air - shower radio signals ; second , this ensures that we measure entirely in the first nyquist domain and can fully reconstruct the signal in this frequency band .",
    "each of the clusters features its own local daq independently ( for an air - shower event a coincidence in at least 3 pmts is required ) .",
    "there the signal from both , the antennas and the pmts , is digitized and transmitted to the central daq via optical fibers where it is stored on disk ( see fig .  [ fig_daq ] ) .",
    "then , during the offline analysis , all independent entries from clusters are merged into hybrid events .",
    "based on the known tunka-133 and tunka - rex hardware properties , particularly , on the differences of cable lengths , we can estimate the window for the radio signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_signal ] ) @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of fadc records in the trace , @xmath19  ns is the binwidth , @xmath20 m , @xmath21 m are the cable lengths to radio antennas and pmts containers respectively , @xmath22 m / s the speed of light , @xmath23 is the signal velocity in the coaxial cable , @xmath24 m is the typical distance between each cluster center and the surrounding pmts , @xmath25 ns is the pmt signal width and @xmath26 ns is the bound for the radio signal window .",
    "the first term in this expression just gives the center of the trace ( approximate position of the signal from last pmt ) , the second term is the delay due to the difference of cable lengths , the third term are possible delays due to geometry of the detector ( for a typical zenith angle of 45@xmath27 ) , and the fourth term describes possible delay between shower arrival and triggering ( passing amplitude threshold for pmt ) .",
    "finally we have chosen @xmath28 to take into account all possible geometries ( i.e. for the range of zenith angles from @xmath29 to @xmath30 ) of air showers .",
    "thus , our estimation for the time window of the radio signal is @xmath31 ns .    for more details on the tunka - rex hardware and the systematic uncertainties on signal reconstruction ,",
    "see ref .  @xcite .",
    "tunka - rex started operation on 8 october 2012 . since then operates within the tunka-133 trigger , i.e. in dark moonless nights with good weather excluding the summer months from may to september .    by design ,",
    "the maximum zenith angle for each pmt illumination is 50@xmath27 ( pmts are placed inside isolated metal barrels whose top is covered by plexiglas ) .",
    "the zenith angle for triggering can be extended up to 70@xmath27 due to indirect detection of light reflected from the inner surfaces of barrels .",
    "thus , all radio events are divided in two groups based on geometry :    * `` vertical '' events : zenith angle @xmath32 with reconstructed geometry , energy , shower maximum available from the air - cherenkov detector .",
    "these events are good candidates for the cross - calibration .",
    "the main disadvantage of them is the low statistics and small number of antennas per event due to the steepness of the lateral distribution of the radio signal . *",
    "`` horizontal '' ( inclined ) events : zenith angle @xmath33 with reliable reconstruction of the shower direction from the air - cherenkov detector . for these events , the other shower parameters can not be reconstructed from the air - cherenkov measurements .",
    "thus , if it is possible to reconstruct the shower parameters ( energy , @xmath34 ) from the radio measurements , this could increase the total statistics of usable events at tunka .    for the exposure and flux estimation from the radio detector we still have to study the background in more details and make performance simulations .",
    "the statistics at smaller angles is mainly suppressed by the steeply falling lateral distribution of the radio signal , the statistics at larger angles is suppressed by trigger detection capabilities . ]        for a first analysis , we used only high quality events which have a clear radio signal ( signal@xmath2 / noise@xmath2 @xmath35 ) in at least three antennas .",
    "based on the detector specifications ( opening angle for the pmt , typical distance between radio stations ) one can assume that the maximum efficiency for hybrid events could be reached near the tunka-133 reconstruction threshold @xmath36 ( fig .  [ fig_angle ] )",
    ". due to these reasons , only a small fraction of the air - cherenkov events have also a clear radio signal ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_exampleevent ] for an example ) .",
    "moreover we demand that the direction reconstructed from the arrival times of the radio signal agrees within @xmath37 with the direction obtained from the photomultiplier array .",
    "this cut excludes most of the background events , which by chance pass the signal - to - noise cut . in future",
    ", we plan to develop improved quality criteria based on the radio signal alone , to distinguish real from false events . for analysis of the radio measurements",
    ", we use the radio extension of the offline software framework developed by the pierre auger collaboration @xcite .",
    "it features a correction of the measured radio signal for the properties of the used hardware and a reconstruction of the electric field - strength vector at each antenna position .",
    "since the absolute calibration of the antennas is still under evaluation we use a simulated pattern for the salla .",
    "ev detected by the pmt array , and those events passing the quality cuts for the radio measurements",
    ". the efficiency increases with energy @xmath38 , the sine of the geomagnetic angle @xmath39 , and the zenith angle @xmath40 . ]",
    "until now , we found 49 events with a zenith angle @xmath41 , and 82 events with @xmath42 in an effective measurement time of 392 hours ( table [ tab_eventstatistics ] ) .",
    "generally , the radio efficiency increases not only with large geomagnetic angles @xmath43 , i.e.  the angle between the shower axis and the geomagnetic field mainly depends on the vector product + @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the shower axis and @xmath46 the geomagnetic field , @xmath47 is the geomagnetic angle . ]",
    "[ fig_angulardistribution ]  and  [ fig_efficiency ] ) , but also with larger zenith angles ( fig .",
    "[ fig_angle ] ) .",
    "in addition , we expect that the event rate will increase when we complete the array to 25 antennas this autumn , and optimize our algorithms for digital background suppression .",
    ".statistics of tunka - rex events passing the quality cuts in dependence of the zenith angle @xmath40 , excluding the period from 08 to 24 oct 2012 used for commissioning of the detector . the effective measurement time and counting rate is limited by the pmt array , i.e.  light ( moon ) and weather conditions .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     to test the expected sensitivity of the tunka - rex measurements to air shower parameters , in particular to the energy , we reconstructed the lateral distribution of the radio signal for the 49 events with @xmath41 . in a first approach",
    ", we used the shower geometry provided by the denser air - cherenkov array to calculate the distance from each antenna to the shower axis , and then plotted the maximum absolute value of the electric field - strength vector as function of this axis distance . to estimate the uncertainties of the amplitude measurements and to correct the measured amplitudes for a bias due to background , we used formulas developed for the east - west aligned antennas of lopes @xcite , and then fitted an exponential function ( fig .",
    "[ fig_exampleldf ]  and  [ fig_ldf2 ] ) .    .",
    "light grey are antennas with signal - noise ratio below threshold ( correspond to grey crosses in fig .",
    "[ fig_exampleevent ] ) . ]",
    "consistent with several historic and modern experiments @xcite , the amplitude parameter of the lateral distribution is correlated with the primary energy ( fig .",
    "[ fig_energy ] ) . however , the analysis is still preliminary , e.g. , because of the status of the calibration and because the impact of the background at the tunka site has to be studied in more detail .",
    "moreover , we expect that the slope of the lateral distribution is sensitive to the position of the shower maximum @xcite , which we will analyze in near future by comparing tunka - rex measurements to the @xmath7 reconstruction of the pmt array tunka-133 .",
    "future work will be dedicated to find an optimal reconstruction algorithm for the energy and @xmath7 , and to test the achievable precision by comparison to the air - cherenkov measurements .",
    "in addition to using the lateral distribution , @xmath7 might also be obtained form the radio measurements via the shape of the radio wavefront @xcite , or the slope of the frequency spectrum @xcite .",
    "( amplitude at 100 m ) , @xmath48 ( slope parameter ) in comparison with shower parameters obtained from the air - cherenkov detector . ]",
    "as a result of the first weeks of operation , tunka - rex registered more than hundred events with significant radio signal from extensive air showers with energies above @xmath49ev in combination with the tunka air - cherenkov array .",
    "this shows that the tunka observatory is able to provide hybrid measurements which is the pre - requisite to perform a cross - calibration between the air - cherenkov and the radio signal .",
    "our measurements are compatible with the picture that the radio emission originates dominantly from the geomagnetic deflection of the charged particles in the air shower . in future",
    ", we plan to optimize the reconstruction techniques , and to compare our measurements to simulations and other experiments .",
    "a detailed background study might help to improve the signal - to - noise ratio and to increase the precision of the reconstruction of the shower maximum .",
    "moreover , we plan to trigger tunka - rex also by the planned scintillator extension of tunka @xcite , and thus can measure also during day to increase the duty cycle by an order of magnitude .",
    "finally , we will test a joint operation with tunka - hiscore @xcite by deploying additional antennas . by this , we can also study to which extent a denser array of radio detectors can increase the detection efficiency and precision for the energy and @xmath34 reconstruction .",
