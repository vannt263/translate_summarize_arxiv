    "generalizing descartes rule of signs to polynomial systems has proven to be a significant challenge .",
    "recall that a weak version of this famous classical result asserts that any real univariate polynomial with exactly @xmath3 monomial terms has at most @xmath4 positive roots .",
    "this bound is sharp and generalizes easily to real exponents ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : back ] ) . the original statement in ren",
    "descartes _ la gomtrie _ pre - dates 1641 .",
    "proofs can be traced back to work of gauss in 1828 and other authors earlier , but a definitive sharp bound for multivariate polynomial systems seems to have elluded us in the second millenium .",
    "this is particularly unfortunate since sparse polynomial systems now occur in applications as diverse as radar imaging @xcite and chemistry @xcite .",
    "one simple way to generalize the setting of descartes rule to higher dimensions and * real * exponents is the following :    for any @xmath5 and @xmath6 , let @xmath7 and call @xmath8 a * monomial term*. we will refer to @xmath9 as the positive * orthant * , or * quadrant * or * octant * when @xmath2 is respectively @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",

    "we call @xmath15 an * @xmath17-variate @xmath18-nomial*-nomials * binomials * and @xmath11-nomials * trinomials*. ] and , when @xmath19 , we call @xmath20 a * @xmath21 fewnomial system - nomials . ] ( over @xmath22 ) of type * @xmath23 . finally , we say a real root @xmath24 of @xmath20 is * isolated * ( resp .",
    "* non - degenerate * ) iff the only arc of real roots of @xmath20 containing @xmath24 is @xmath24 itself    suppose @xmath20 is an @xmath25 fewnomial system of type @xmath26 .",
    "then the maximum number of non - degenerate roots of @xmath20 in the positive orthant is @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28    [ rem : pyr ] the polynomial system @xmath29 easily shows that the conjectured maximum can at least be attained ( if not exceeded ) , and integral exponents and coefficients suffice for this to happen .",
    "we can then succinctly state the original kushnirenko s conjecture ( formulated in the mid-1970 s by anatoly g.  kushnirenko ) as the special case of gkc where all the exponents of @xmath20 are non - negative integers .",
    "curiously , kushnirenko s conjecture was open for nearly three decades until bertrand haas found a counter - example in the case @xmath31 ( see remark [ rem : haas ] below and @xcite ) .",
    "so we will derive a correct and sharp extension of descartes bound to this case , as well as certain additional cases with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and degeneracies allowed .",
    "interestingly , the introduction of real exponents and degeneracies gives us more flexibility than trouble : the proof of our first main result uses little more than exponential coordinates and rolle s theorem from calculus .    for any @xmath34 ,",
    "let @xmath35 ( resp .",

    "the value of @xmath47 was previously unknown and the authors are unaware of any earlier result implying the equality @xmath42 .",
    "in particular , the only other information previously known about @xmath48 or @xmath49 was an upper bound of @xmath50 for @xmath48 ( see remark [ rem : kho ] below ) .",

    "@xmath30    [ rem : haas ] haas counter - example to the original kushnirenko s conjecture is @xmath59 which has @xmath0 roots in the positive quadrant , thus contradicting its alleged gkc bound of @xmath60 @xcite .",

    "note that a non - compact component of @xmath69 can actually have compact closure , since @xmath63 is not closed in @xmath78 , e.g. , @xmath79 .",
    "also , bertrand haas has pointed out that the bound on @xmath80 , at least in the case of integral exponents , may date back to work of isaac newton in the 17@xmath81 century on power series .",
    "@xmath30    while the above bounds on the number of connected components are non - explicit , they are stated so they can immediately incorporate any advance in computing @xmath82 .",
    "so for a general and explicit bound independent of the underlying polynomial degrees now , one could , for instance , simply insert the explicit upper bound for @xmath83 appearing in khovanski s theorem on fewnomials ( see section [ sub : rel ] below ) .    following the notation of theorem [ thm : cool ]",

    ") let @xmath20 be an @xmath25 fewnomial system and @xmath66 the total number of distinct exponent vectors of @xmath20 .",

    "@xmath28    [ rem : kho ] in the case @xmath88 , one can divide both equations by suitable monomials to obtain @xmath89 and thus @xmath90 .",
    "so khovanski s bound implies @xmath91 .",
    "it is also very easy to see that a simple application of gaussian elimination yields @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath30    non - trivial lower bounds on even @xmath48 are scarce and surprisingly little else is known about what an optimal version of khovanski s theorem on fewnomials should resemble . for example , an earlier ( conjectural ) polyhedral generalization of descartes rule to multivariate systems of equations proposed by itenberg and roy in 1996 @xcite ( based on a famous construction of oleg viro from 1989 and extensions by bernd sturmfels @xcite ) was recently disproved @xcite .",
    "also , a bit earlier , bernd sturmfels bet ( and unfortunately lost ) us$500 on a challenge problem involving a family of polynomial systems of type @xmath93 @xcite .    to the best of the authors knowledge ,",
    "all other general bounds on the number of real roots depend strongly on the individual exponents of @xmath20 and are actually geared more toward counting complex roots , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "so even proving @xmath94 already requires a different approach .",
    "nevertheless , the aforementioned bounds can be quite practical when the exponents are integral and the degrees of the polynomials are small .    in any event",
    ", it still remains unknown whether @xmath82 is polynomial in @xmath3 for @xmath2 fixed .",
    "( the polynomial system @xmath95 shows us that fixing @xmath2 is necessary . ) even the case of a trinomial and an @xmath3-nomial , in two variables , remains open .",
    "more to the point , it is also unknown whether a simple modification ( e.g. , increasing the original gkc bound by a constant power or a factor exponential in @xmath2 ) changes the status of gkc from false to true . the @xmath96 fewnomial system @xmath97 ,",
    "thanks to haas counter - example ( cf .",
    "remark [ rem : haas ] ) , easily shows that the gkc bound now needs at least an extra multiple no smaller than @xmath98 if it is to be salvaged .",
    "[ rem : napo ] domenico napoletani has recently shown that to calculate @xmath99 for any given @xmath26 , it suffices to restrict to the case of integral exponents @xcite . here",
    ", we will bound @xmath49 directly without using this reduction .",
    "let us also make a related number - theoretic observation : hendrik w.  lenstra has shown that for any fixed number field @xmath100 , the maximal ( finite ) number of roots in @xmath100 of a univariate @xmath3-nomial , with integral exponents and coefficients in @xmath100 , is quasi - quadratic in @xmath3 and independent of the degree of the polynomial @xcite .",
    "thus an immediately corollary of theorem [ thm : tri3 ] ( and theorem [ thm : tri1 ] and remark [ rem : extra ] of section [ sec : back ] ) is that lenstra s result can be effectively extended to certain families of fewnomial systems , provided we fix @xmath2 and restrict to real algebraic number fields .",
    "( fixing @xmath2 is necessary for the same reason as in the last paragraph . )    whether lenstra s result can be more fully extended to polynomial systems is also an open question , even in the case of two bivariate trinomials .",
    "however , it is at least now known that that the number of * geometrically * , where @xmath101 is the algebraic closure of @xmath100 . ]",
    "isolated roots in @xmath102 of any @xmath103 polynomial system can be bounded above by * some * function depending only on @xmath100 , @xmath2 , and the total number of distinct exponent vectors @xcite . to be any finite extension of the @xmath104-adic rationals .",
    "the latter setting is perhaps closer to our current focus since @xmath105 , like the @xmath104-adics , is a metrically complete field . ]",
    "+ section [ sec : back ] provides some background and unites some simple cases where gkc in fact holds .",
    "we then prove theorems [ thm : tri3 ] and [ thm : cool ] in sections [ sec : tx ] and [ sec : morse ] , respectively .",
    "proving the upper bound on @xmath49 turns out to be surprisingly elementary , but lowering the bound on @xmath47 to @xmath0 then becomes a more involved case by case analysis .",
    "section [ sec : tri ] then gives an alternative geometric proof that @xmath106 .",
    "we include this second proof for motivational purposes , since it was essentially the first improvement we found over @xmath107 .",
    "we then derive bounds for the number of isolated singularities and inflection points of an @xmath3-nomial curve , and discuss how the underlying * newton polygons * ( cf .  the next section ) strongly control how @xmath47 can exceed @xmath60 ( cf .",
    "corollary [ cor : poly ] of section [ sec : tri ] ) . roughly speaking",
    ", we show that if a fewnomial system of type @xmath108 has maximally many roots in the positive quadrant , then its underlying exponent vectors must be in `` general position .

    "furthermore , we can also assume that every non - compact component of @xmath578 has unbounded values of @xmath165 .",
    "so we are now ready to use critical points to count connected components .",
    "consider then the system of equations @xmath616 , where @xmath617 denotes the operator @xmath618 . by construction ,",
    "every compact connected component of @xmath578 results in at least two extrema of the function @xmath165 , i.e. , @xmath67 is bounded above by an integer no more than half of the total number of roots of @xmath619 and @xmath620 .",

    "to prove assertion ( 2 ) of theorem [ thm : cool ] , another application of lemma [ lemma : fiber ] ( and our much used proposition [ prop : easy ] ) tells us that we can assume that every unbounded connected component of @xmath69 has arbitrarily large values of @xmath165 . for @xmath625",

    "so by what we ve already proved for our unbounded components , we at last obtain @xmath630 .",
    "the bound for @xmath80 then follows from the now classical moment map .",

    "since any non - compact component @xmath579 of @xmath69 results in @xmath639 having at least @xmath10 intersections with the edges of @xmath468 , ugdrs immediately implies our bound for @xmath80 , not to mention our bound for @xmath640 .",
    "( in fact , in our bound for @xmath80 , we can even replace @xmath3 by the number of monomials corresponding to points on the boundary of @xmath468 . )",
    "assertion ( 3 ) of theorem [ thm : cool ] follows immediately from assertion ( 4 ) , which we will now prove .",
    "first note that the singular points of @xmath69 are exactly the roots of the over - determined fewnomial system @xmath641 .",
    "by lemma [ lemma : gh ] the singular points of @xmath69 are also contained in the roots of the system @xmath642 , where @xmath598 is of type @xmath643 , has no more than @xmath3 distinct exponent vectors , and each @xmath644 is a suitable linear combination of @xmath114 , @xmath645 , and @xmath646 .",
    "furthermore , the real zero set of @xmath598 is the union of the real zero set of @xmath20 and a ( possibly empty ) finite set of points .",
    "this proves the bound on @xmath647 , and the bound on @xmath648 is proved in almost exactly the same way , starting with the polynomial system @xmath649 instead .",
    "so assertion ( 4 ) is proved .    to prove assertion ( 5 ) , note that by lemmata [ lemma : tri2 ] and [ lemma : imp ] , @xmath650 is an inflection point or a singular point of @xmath651 , where @xmath652 is a homogeneous polynomial , * in the non - constant monomials terms of @xmath653 * , of degree at most @xmath11 . letting @xmath654 denote the non - constant monomials terms of @xmath114 ,",

    "however , @xmath598 is of type @xmath643 , has no more than @xmath3 distinct exponent vectors , and has no degenerate roots .",
