    "the phenomenon of phase - coexistence is the typical signature of a first - order transition .",
    "the free energy of a system at the coexistence point is the sum of two contributions : the bulk free energy @xmath5 , scaling like the volume @xmath6 , and the free energy @xmath7 of the _ interface _ @xmath8 separating the two bulk phases .",
    "@xmath7 scales like an area .",
    "the interface tension @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 ( the _ reduced _ tension is defined as @xmath11 ) . in the context of @xmath12 pure gauge theories ( @xmath13 is the number of colors ) phase - coexistence occurs in two different situations : one at @xmath14 between ordered phases pointing in different directions in color space , the other at @xmath15 , between confined ( ` disordered ' ) and deconfined ( ` ordered ' ) phases .",
    "the corresponding interface tensions are indicated @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively .",
    "this paper presents a new algorithm to measure the order - order interface tension .",
    "nevertheless , we can also give an estimate of the order - disorder tension via the so - called _ perfect wetting",
    "_ hypothesis @xcite , which states that between two ordered phases a layer of disordered phase can be generated at no free energy cost .",
    "therefore the free energy of one order - order interface is related to that of _ two _ order - disorder interfaces , namely @xmath18 . in general , anyway , @xmath19 , because otherwise order - order interfaces would be unstable .",
    "therefore the choice @xmath20 gives a lower bound for @xmath21 .",
    "our system is a @xmath22 @xmath12 pure gauge theory at finite temperature with spatial periodic boundary conditions ( b.c . ) .",
    "@xmath23 indicates the lattice spacing .",
    "the volume is @xmath24 ; the wilson action is used .",
    "we will indicate the elements of the center of @xmath12 by @xmath25 .",
    "heat - bath and over - relaxation are applied to @xmath26 subgroups of the @xmath12 matrices , according to the strategy used in @xcite .",
    "cartoon of the interface , in an intermediate situation in which only half of the plaquettes has been flipped .",
    "the solid central plaquette is affected by the least finite size effects.,height=132 ]    the algorithm we propose is an improvement of the so - called _ snake algorithm _ @xcite .",
    "the ` snake ' idea is to add ` by hand ' a @xmath27 interface in the system by progressively flipping the coupling of a set of plaquettes dual to a surface @xmath28 , according to the identity    @xmath29    where @xmath30 $ ] indicates the partition function of a system in which only @xmath31 plaquettes are flipped .",
    "the free energy of the interface is @xmath32 .",
    "a direct measurement of @xmath33 is not possible due to a serious _ overlap problem _ , which is alleviated by the factorization eq.([eq : chain_rule ] ) .",
    "the price to pay is a very large number ( @xmath34 ) of independent simulations .",
    "progress in this direction is made comparing the following equations    @xmath35    the first just being a decomposition of the interface into the constituent plaquettes , the second indicating that each ratio , up to finite size ( f.s . )",
    "corrections , contains all the information we need , namely    @xmath36    so that a _ single",
    "_ simulation suffices .",
    "the gain in efficiency is @xmath37 : a factor @xmath34 in the number of simulations , another factor @xmath34 because the @xmath34 variances of the ratios add up in eq.([eq : chain_rule ] ) . the observable",
    "is measured in the following way :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 indicates the @xmath3th flipped plaquette , and the average @xmath40 refers to the ensemble in which the first @xmath41 plaquettes are flipped , the @xmath3th plaquette has coupling zero , and all the others are unchanged .",
    "further variance reduction methods are described in @xcite .",
    "the leading finite - size corrections in eq.([eq : general_form_for_corrections ] ) come from gaussian fluctuations of the interface @xcite . our @xmath42 interface ( fig .",
    "[ fig : central_plaq ] ) is periodic in one direction ( @xmath43 ) , and pinned in the other ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the corresponding correction , given in terms of the dedekind @xmath45-function , reduces for @xmath46 to the luscher - like @xmath47 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : plateau_su3 ] we show our measurements , after removal of this known correction , as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "a broad plateau develops , from small values @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the correlation length , to large ones @xmath50 , showing that additional corrections are very small . at very large distances , a systematic drop is visible , because it becomes more favorable to produce a full , translationally invariant interface plus a partial one of width @xmath51 .",
    "let us then fix @xmath52 ; after removal of the lscher corrections , fig .",
    "[ fig : fs_effects ] shows that the tension decreases considerably with the lattice size and reaches a plateau only when the empirical condition @xmath53 is satisfied .",
    "summary of results on the order - disorder interface tension for @xmath54 . to avoid an underestimate of @xmath9 because of f.s .",
    "effects , we use a lattice of size @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) , @xmath59 @xmath60 .",
    "the latter simulation is in progress . ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tension_su3 ] we present preliminary results for the order - disorder interface tension in @xmath54 , together with a compilation of the published data .",
    "while our @xmath61 simulation needs more statistics , our @xmath62 and @xmath63 determinations of @xmath9 are accurate , and much larger than previous measurements obtained with the histogram method @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we assign this discrepancy to the smaller lattice sizes considered previously , which lead to a systematic underestimate of @xmath9 as in fig .",
