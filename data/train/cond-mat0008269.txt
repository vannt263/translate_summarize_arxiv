    "the statistical properties of the spectra of disordered systems continues to be a vivid field of research both analytically and numerically .",
    "it is by now well established that the spectral fluctuations in the limit of vanishing disorder are described by the random matrix theory ( rmt ) @xcite with corrections of the order of @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the dimensionless classical conductance of the system .",
    "this is because in this regime the states are extended ( ergodic ) . in the limit of infinite disorder ,",
    "on the other hand , due to the extremely strong localization of the eigenstates the levels are practically uncorrelated at least in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the first attempts @xcite to investigate the statistics at the localization  delocalization transition ( ldt ) ( also known as the metal ",
    "insulator transition ) , showed that indeed the statistics at the ldt is different from the two other extremes .",
    "eventually it shares some of the features of both of them .",
    "it has been shown numerically in many simulations @xcite that e.g. the nearest neighbor spacing distribution , @xmath2 , the probability of finding no eigenlevels within an energy window of length @xmath3 , behaves for low@xmath3 as @xmath4 , and for large@xmath3 as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 and 4 depending on the global orthogonal , unitary and symplectic symmetry of the system , and @xmath7 is a constant that depends weakly on @xmath8 but strongly on dimensionality @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "the presence of the level repulsion at low@xmath3 is a direct consequence that the eigenstates at the ldt are heavily fluctuating but still strongly overlapping @xcite .",
    "the heavy fluctuations expressed as their multifractal character @xcite enters in the parameter @xmath7 that is connected both to the correlation dimension of the states and the level compressibility @xcite .",
    "such a relation shows how the statistical properties of the levels and the states are coupled at the ldt .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    "we have presented numerical evidence that using appropriate indices to describe the overall shape of @xmath2 , a superuniversal ( i.e. @xmath8 independent ) scaling relation is revealed as the system undergoes the transition from the metal to an insulator .",
    "here we give further evidence that with the change of system size @xmath10 and disorder @xmath11 the nearest neighbor spacing distribution , @xmath2 , evolves as a one  parameter family of distributions .",
    "a similar evolution has been shown analytically to exist by shapiro @xcite for the conductance distribution in @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter in our case is also the scaling variable that can be chosen as @xmath1 , i.e. the classical , dimensionless conductance of the system .",
    "in order to study the statistical properties of disordered systems with and without time reversal symmetry and with broken rotational symmetry we have used the anderson model which is a tight  binding model defined on a @xmath13 lattice . for the details we refer to the review of kramer and mackinnon @xcite and also our previous work @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the numerical results have been illustrated using the symplectic case where the rotational symmetry has been broken with the introduction of spin  orbit scattering .",
    "here we present the results of the case with ( without ) time reversal symmetry corresponding to the orthogonal ( unitary ) symmetry .",
    "time reversal symmetry has been broken by the introduction of a magnetic field .",
    "after appropriately unfolding the spectra in many samples of the system we calculated the nearest neighbor spacing distribution , @xmath2 . for each system size @xmath10 and disorder",
    "@xmath11 the number of spacings was of the order of @xmath14 . in order to characterize the shape of @xmath2 we use generalized rnyi ",
    "entropies @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the second moment of @xmath2 , while @xmath17 . after a proper rescaling",
    "we obtain @xmath18 where index @xmath19 refers to the poissonian , uncorrelated case and @xmath20 to the wigner ",
    "surmise representing the rmt cases respectively .",
    "their values are listed in table  [ t1 ] .",
    "such a rescaling ensures that @xmath21 belonging to the rmt ( poisson ) limit .",
    ".[t1 ] shape descriptive parameters for the case of different @xmath2 functions . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     we will show below evidence that the overall scaling behavior in figure  [ all ] can be understood if the spacing distribution for any finite value of @xmath11 and @xmath10 , i.e. for @xmath22 is given as @xmath23 with @xmath24 . here",
    "the function @xmath25 is simply the wigner  surmise and @xmath26 is the histogram measured in the numerical simulation .",
    "all three functions , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are spacing distribution functions .    in the next section",
    "we will prove that for the convolution of the type ( [ conv ] ) the rnyi  entropies introduced in @xcite are additive .",
    "therefore , apart from the denominator , the constant shift in ( [ stilde ] ) corresponds to @xmath29 in ( [ conv ] ) , hence we may conclude that the relation in figure  [ all ] is described by the properties of function @xmath30 .    we will also show that the solution of ( [ conv ] ) for @xmath31 in the extreme cases ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) can be done analytically and that a phenomenological interpolation can describe the @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 relation in figure  [ all ] .",
    "the expression ( [ conv ] ) is in fact a convolution and after a variable transformation can be written as @xmath36 let us denote the @xmath37-th moment of a distribution @xmath38 by @xmath39 $ ] . then it is easy to see from ( [ conv2 ] ) ( omitting indices @xmath1 and @xmath8 ) that @xmath40&=&\\int_0^{\\infty}ds\\,s^k{\\cal p}(s ) \\nonumber \\\\                     & = & \\int_0^{\\infty}\\frac{dt}{t}{\\cal w}(t )                        \\int_0^{\\infty}ds\\,s^k{\\cal q }                                       \\left ( \\frac{s}{t}\\right ) \\nonumber \\\\                     & = & \\int_0^{\\infty}dt\\,t^k{\\cal w}(t )                        \\int_0^{\\infty}du\\,u^k{\\cal q}(u ) \\nonumber \\\\                     & = & \\mu_k[{\\cal w}]\\mu_k[{\\cal q}],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which for @xmath41 yields the desired additivity . a similar procedure yields the additivity of the quantity @xmath42 .",
    "the key step is to realize that the entropic moment of @xmath38 is @xmath43= \\langle s\\ln s\\rangle$ ] which can be expressed as @xmath44=\\mu_1[{\\cal q}]\\mu_s[{\\cal w}]+\\mu_1[{\\cal w}]\\mu_s[{\\cal q}].\\ ] ]",
    "here we show that the solution of ( [ conv ] ) for @xmath31 in the extreme cases ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) can be obtained analytically and that a phenomenological interpolation can describe the @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 relation in figure  [ all ] .",
    "first it is easy to see that for the case of vanishing disorder ( @xmath33 ) we expect that @xmath45 . in this case @xmath46 . on the other hand at the other extreme , when @xmath47 ,",
    "another universality is expected : @xmath48 , the poissonian distribution . in this case after nontrivial calculations , eq .  ( [ conv2 ] )",
    "is solved for @xmath49 @xmath50 where @xmath51 , with @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 for @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "the complementary error function is denoted as erfc .",
    "now a phenomenological step is introduced in order to describe the evolution of @xmath61 for any finite value of @xmath1 .",
    "we propose a simple form @xmath62 where the coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 are determined from the normalization conditions @xmath65=\\mu_1[{\\cal q}]=1 $ ] .",
    "obviously for @xmath47 they yield the values given above for ( [ wp ] ) . for @xmath33 @xmath66 , as well .",
    "the @xmath34 vs. @xmath35 relation for this interpolating function is depicted as continuous curves in fig .  [ all ] .",
    "they still have a small @xmath8 dependence but follow the data very closely .",
    "the @xmath8dependence can be attributed to ( @xmath67 ) the simple interpolation we used in ( [ interp ] ) and to ( @xmath68 ) the fact that we focused only on the linear shift introduced in @xmath69 and disregarded the denominator .",
    "in this paper we have given further details , both numerical and analytical of a recently discovered scaling relation existing in the evolution of the nearest neighbor spacing distribution , @xmath2 , as the dimensionless conductance @xmath1 changes from 0 ( localized ) to @xmath70 ( metal ) ."
