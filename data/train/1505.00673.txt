    "study of the phase structure of @xmath5dimensional yang - mills ( ym ) theory coupled to matter on @xmath6 sphere and especially the confinement / deconfinement transition in large @xmath7 gauge theories on sphere sheds light on various phenomena in gravitational phase transition such as black hole nucleation , via the ads / cft correspondence . in this direction ,",
    "the phase structure of chern - simons ( cs ) theory coupled to matter and its gravitational dual , vasiliev higher spin gravity , @xcite , have been studied recently , @xcite and @xcite . in a recent work @xcite , it has been argued that level @xmath0 , @xmath1 cs theory coupled to fundamental matter on @xmath2 at finite temperature @xmath3 , can be explained by a discrete unitary matrix model , and its phase structure , the eigenvalue density in different phases , has been studied in the limit of large @xmath8 , with fixed parameters @xmath9 , by using steepest descent method .",
    "this study is based on the reduction of the chern - simons matter ( csm ) theory first to the cs theory with an effective potential and second to a discrete version of two - dimensional ym theory and its representation , one matrix model . in a special case with gross - witten - wadia ( gww )",
    "effective potential , @xcite and @xcite , in addition to well - known lower - gap phase , an upper - gap phase is observed , @xcite and @xcite , in which the upper bound of the eigenvalue density is saturated .    in another discipline of research , discrete toeplitz determinants",
    "are studied in @xcite , and by using the continuous orthogonal polynomials their precise forms are obtained in terms of the continuous toeplitz determinants and the fredholm determinant . a key fact to understand the application of the toeplitz determinant in the csm theory is the heine - sezg identity which relates the matrix model integral and the toeplitz determinant , see appendix a.    using the relation between toeplitz determinants and matrix integrals , and the above results for discrete matrix model representation of the csm theory , in this paper , the techniques and methods from discrete toeplitz determinant is employed to study the csm theory .",
    "the matrix integral representations of the ym theory and csm theory provide the application of well - developed techniques of random matrix theory and specially the toeplitz determinant .    in our setting",
    ", the partition functions of ym theory and csm theory with an arbitrary potential @xmath10 can be written as toeplitz determinant and discrete toeplitz determinant with respect to the probabilistic weight @xmath11 , respectively , @xmath12    in this study , we move towards an exact determination of the thermal partition function of csm theory .",
    "in fact , by adopting recent results , @xcite , about the discrete and continuous toeplitz determinants , a new explicit expression for the partition function of csm theory in terms of the partition function of ym theory , as a function of @xmath8 at the finite values and in the asymptotic regime , is obtained . especially , a csm theory with gww effective potential is studied in detail and analytic forms of the effective partition function and free energy of csm theory are obtained .",
    "furthermore , the sub - leading corrections in the asymptotic results are computed and the result is interpreted as the energy of the upper bound .",
    "these results lead to a phase transition in the asymptotic regime of the discrete matrix model , related to the phase transition between upper - bound phase and no - upper bound phase .",
    "although , the effective gww potential is not a microscopic potential and it does not exactly characterize the csm theory , but the csm model with gww potential shares some features with the real cs theory such as the minimum of any effective potential @xmath13 ( as a function of holonomy @xmath14 ) is always at @xmath15 and the depth of the potential increases as a function of @xmath16 .    in brief , the phase structure of the model in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath17 is studied via the asymptotic behavior of the ratio of partition functions which is obtained as the tracy - widom distribution .",
    "then , from analytic expression for the free energy , obtained from the expansion of tracy - widom distribution , new second - order and third - order phase transitions in this model are determined . moreover ,",
    "relation between the obtained result in this paper and other recent results is explored .",
    "the phases of csm theory , can be discussed from the viewpoint of the existence of the continuum limit .",
    "in fact , the continuum limit does not exist in whole moduli space of the parameters and in fact , @xmath17 should satisfy certain relations in order to determine the continuum limit .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section two , the csm theory and the discrete matrix integral representation of the partition function are explained in brief . in section three ,",
    "the main results of this study are expressed .",
    "first , the partition function and free energy of the csm theory with gww potential are explicitly obtained and subsequently the phase structure of the model with gww potential is studied . in section four ,",
    "possible interpretations of the obtained results are discussed and directions for further studies are introduced .",
    "finally , there are two appendices , where necessary materials from the random matrix theory such as orthogonal polynomials , toeplitz determinant and riemann - hilbert problem ( rhp ) and their inter - relations are introduced and well - known results in two - dimensional ym theory with gww potential in terms of toeplitz determinant and rhp problem , and some results about the partition function and phase structure in the csm theory are summarized . finally , some necessary definitions and results about tracy - widom distribution are collected .",
    "in this section , the level @xmath0 , @xmath1 csm theory coupled to fundamental matter at temperature @xmath3 on @xmath2 is described . especially , the cs theory coupled with the matter in fundamental representation on @xmath2 , in @xmath18 limit with the fixed t hooft parameter , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , will be studied . in this part , we explain two relevant and necessary results from the literature ; i ) the action of pure cs theory coupled with fundamental matter in the t hooft limit and at high temperature , up to leading order in @xmath7 , can be expressed as the sum of the action of pure cs theory and an effective action , i.e. effective potential which is a local function of holonomy matrix @xmath21 with eigenvalues @xmath22 around @xmath23 with @xmath24 .",
    "ii ) the partition function of the csm theory with effective potential can be written as a discrete version of the matrix integral representation of the @xmath25 ym theory with the effective potential .",
    "these observations are explained in this section and in the appendix a , not only for the article to be self contained but also because of their importance and usefulness in understanding the physics and mathematics of the problem studied in this article , since our new results are based on these observations .      cs theory is a three - dimensional topological field theory of the schwarz type @xcite , with no metric dependence in the action .",
    "consider a three - dimensional manifold @xmath26 with a principal @xmath27bundle with a connection @xmath28 , then the cs action is defined by @xmath29 where @xmath0 is called level and it is an integer in the quantized theory .",

    "the partition function and correlation functions of the theory define global topological invariants of the manifold as well as other topological invariants associated to the manifold such as knot invariants , jones polynomials , etc . @xcite . in this study , we are interested in cs theory on curved background @xmath2 .",
    "such curved backgrounds provide enough symmetry for explicit computation of the partition function and correlation functions .",
    "for example , the partition function of cs theory on seifert manifolds such as @xmath36 admits a matrix model representation and thus analytic closed expressions for the partition function have been obtained in @xcite . for a general review on this and other different aspects of cs theory ,",

    "the behavior of the csm theories and their partition functions and free energies as functions of @xmath16 and @xmath37 has been a subject of intense studies during past years . in the limit @xmath38 , the behavior of csm theory and its thermal free energy has been studied in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",

    "the matter content of the csm theory consists of vector massive fields in the fundamental representation such as fermionic and bosonic fields minimally coupled to cs fields , for further details see references in the previous paragraph . in this study",
    "we will not discuss any computations containing explicit forms of the matter fields , thus we will keep to our general form of matter action and we will not be more explicit about it . as we will see in the following , in the high temperature limit ,",
    "the matter fields have masses of order the temperature and the effective action only depends on the holonomy field .",
    "the goal of this part is to compute the partition function of csm theory . in order to do this computation , roughly speaking",
    ", we have to sum all the vacuum graphs of the massless and massive fields and thus the partition function of csm theory is obtained by summing up all the separate contributions from the vacuum graphs of massive and massless fields including the holonomy field . in brief",
    ", we first evaluate the path integral on the matter fields which gives us the partition function as a path integral over massless fields with a cs action and an effective action for the holonomy field .",
    "the effective action is directly obtained from path integration over the massive fields .",
    "more precisely , after integration over the massive fields , a local effective action , @xmath42 , for the @xmath25 unitary matrix valued holonomy @xmath21 around @xmath23 with @xmath24 is obtained and the csm partition function takes the following form , @xmath43 \\ e^{\\ii\\mathcal{s}_{cs}-\\mathcal{s}_{eff}(u)}.\\ ] ]    here , we briefly discuss the behavior of the effective action such as its series expansion and its leading term in the large @xmath7 limit which is a local function of holonomy field .",
    "the key fact in evaluation of the effective action and csm partition function is the following observation in @xcite . in order to obtain the effective action ,",
    "we integrated out the vacuum graphs of the matter fields and since these matter fields develop large thermal masses , thus @xmath42 can be expanded as the following local series , @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are local effective potentials which their actual forms depend on the matter content and cs couplings . in the large @xmath7 limit",
    ", the explicit computation of the effective potentials as a function of @xmath37 , for any given vector matter cs theory is feasible .",
    "for example , for csm theory with @xmath15 , and minimally coupled fundamental fermions to the cs fields , the effective potential computed by using large @xmath7 techniques in the light - cone gauge , @xcite .",
    "this computation has been generalized to other theories and different holonomy matrices , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein .",
    "it has been argued in @xcite , that the effective potentials are of order @xmath7 , and since @xmath47 , the first term in the expansion of the effective potential is of order @xmath48 and the second one is of order @xmath7 and the rest are further suppressed at large @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , at large @xmath7 with @xmath49 , up to leading order in @xmath7 , the entire effect of matter loops in vacuum graphs on the dynamics of the cs theory is represented by the high temperature effective action of the following form , @xmath50 and finally the thermal partition function of the csm theory becomes @xmath51e^{\\ii\\frac { k}{4\\pi}\\int_m tr ( ada+\\frac { 2}{3}a^3)-t\\int d^2x\\sqrt { g}v ( u ( x))}=<e^{-tv_2 v(u)}>_{n , k},\\ ] ] where @xmath52 is the @xmath25 volume of @xmath53 and since the pure cs is topological , the expectation value of the exponential of the integral of the effective potential over @xmath53 is independent of @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , the csm partition function can be written as a topological observable of the pure cs theory , i.e. an expected value of linear combination of the wilson loops in pure cs theory . for more",
