    "the concept of temporal persistence @xcite , which is closely related to first - passage statistics , has been used recently to study various non - markovian stochastic processes both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .",
    "another quantity of interest in the study of the statistics of spatially extended systems is its natural analog , the _ spatial persistence probability_. this idea has been investigated theoretically @xcite in the context of @xmath0dimensional gaussian interfaces with dynamics described by linear langevin equations , where the variable undergoing stochastic evolution is the height @xmath1 of the interfacial sites ( @xmath2 is the lateral position along the interface and @xmath3 is the time ) .",
    "the spatial persistence probability of fluctuating interfaces , denoted by @xmath4 , is simply the probability that the height of a steady - state interface configuration , measured at a fixed time @xmath5 , _ does not _ return to its `` original '' value @xmath6 at the initial point @xmath7 within a distance @xmath2 measured from @xmath8 along the interface . in the long - time ,",
    "steady - state limit , the spatial persistence probability @xmath4 , which depends only on @xmath2 for a translationally invariant interface , has been shown @xcite to exhibit a power - law decay , @xmath9 .",
    "one of the interesting results reported in ref.@xcite is that the spatial persistence exponent @xmath10 can take two values determined by the initial conditions or selection rules imposed on the starting point @xmath7 :  1 ) @xmath11 , the `` steady state '' ( ss ) persistence exponent if @xmath8 is sampled uniformly from _ all _ the sites of a steady - state configuration ; and  2 ) @xmath12 , the so - called _ finite - initial - conditions _ ( fic ) persistence exponent if the sampling of @xmath7 is performed from a _ subset _ of steady - state sites where the height variable and its spatial derivatives are _ finite_. the spatial persistence probabilities obtained for these two different ways of sampling the initial point are denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the values of the exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 for interfaces with dynamics described by a class of linear langevin equations have been determined in ref .",
    "@xcite using a mapping between the spatial statistical properties of the interface in the steady state and the temporal properties of stochastic processes described by a generalized random - walk equation .",
    "it turns out that for these systems , @xmath15 is equal to either @xmath17 for @xmath18 or @xmath19 for @xmath20 , where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the spatial dimension , and @xmath23 is the standard dynamical exponent of the underlying langevin equation .",
    "the fic spatial persistence exponent is found to have the value @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is a temporal persistence exponent for the generalized random walk problem to which the spatial statistics of the interface is mapped .",
    "two exact results for @xmath25 are available in the literature : @xmath26 , corresponding to the classical brownian motion @xcite and @xmath27 , corresponding to the random acceleration problem @xcite .",
    "very recently , experimental measurements of the spatial persistence probability have been performed @xcite for a system ( combustion fronts in paper ) that is believed to belong to the kardar  parisi ",
    "zhang ( kpz )  @xcite universality class .",
    "however , the fic spatial persistence probability is not investigated at all in this work . instead",
    ", the authors analyze a `` transient '' spatial persistence ( i.e. , the probability is measured by sampling over all the sites of a transient interfacial profile obtained before the steady state is reached ) .",
    "this transient spatial persistence is completely different from the fic spatial persistence which is measured in the steady - state regime by sampling a special class of initial sites . as a consequence",
    ", additional study is required in order to understand the experimental and numerical possibilities for measuring @xmath28 and its associated nontrivial exponent @xmath16 .    in this paper , we present the results of a detailed numerical study of spatial persistence in a class of one - dimensional models of fluctuating interfaces .",
    "our interest in analyzing the spatial persistence of fluctuating interfaces is motivated to a large extent by their important ( and far from completely understood ) role in the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology where the desired stability of nanodevices requires understanding and controlling thermal interfacial fluctuations . in this context , the study of first - passage statistics in general , or of the persistence probability ( both spatial and temporal ) @xcite in particular , turns out to be a very useful approach . to address this problem we consider stochastic interfaces with dynamics governed by the edwards  wilkinson ( ew )  @xcite and kpz equations . for the ew equation , we consider both white noise ( uncorrelated in both space and time ) and",
    "`` colored''noise that is correlated in space but uncorrelated in time .",
    "the effect of noise in spatially distributed systems is an interesting problem by itself and has been widely studied @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effects of noise statistics on the spatial structure of fluctuating interfaces using the conceptual tool of spatial persistence probability . using the isomorphic mapping procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , we derive exact analytical results for the spatial persistence exponents of @xmath0dimensional ew interfaces driven by power - law correlated noise .",
    "we then compare our analytical results with those obtained from numerical integrations of the corresponding stochastic equations .",
    "the use of power - law correlated noise in the ew equation allows us to explore the situation where the two spatial persistence exponents @xmath15 and @xmath16 are different .    our numerical study also provide a characterization of the scaling behavior of spatial persistence probabilities as functions of the system size .",
    "information about the system - size dependence of persistence probabilities is necessary for extracting the persistence exponents from experimental and numerical data . in studies of the scaling behavior of spatial persistence probabilities",
    ", one has to consider another important length scale that always appears in practical measurements : this is the _ sampling distance _ @xmath29 which represents the `` nearest - neighbor''spacing of the uniform grid of spatial points where the height variable @xmath30 is measured at a fixed time @xmath5 .",
    "the sampling distance @xmath29 is the spatial analog of the `` sampling time ''  @xcite that represents the time - interval between two successive measurements of the height at a fixed position in experimental and computational studies of temporal persistence .",
    "once the effect of a finite @xmath29 on the measured spatial persistence is understood , one can relate correctly the experimental and numerical results to the theoretical predictions .",
    "our study shows that the spatial persistence probabilities ( both ss and fic ) exhibit simple scaling behavior as functions of the system size and the sampling distance .",
    "in addition to the temporal persistence probability , the temporal survival probability @xcite has been shown recently to represent an alternative valuable statistical tool for investigations of first - passage properties of spatially extended systems with stochastic evolution . in the context of interface dynamics",
    ", the temporal survival probability is defined as the probability that the height of the interface at a fixed position does not cross its _ time - averaged _ value over time @xmath3 .",
    "in contrast to the power - law behavior of the temporal persistence probability ( which , we recall , measures the probability of not returning to the initial position ) , the temporal survival probability exhibits an exponential decay at long times , providing information about the underlying physical mechanisms and their associated time scales @xcite . in this study , we make the first attempt to analyze the behavior of the _ spatial survival probability _ , @xmath31 , defined as the probability of the interface height between points @xmath7 ( which is an arbitrarily chosen initial position ) and @xmath32 not reaching the average level @xmath33 ( rather than the original value @xmath6 ) .",
    "we present numerical results for @xmath31 that show that its spatial behavior in the ss regime is neither power - law , nor exponential , while in the fic regime , it becomes very similar to the spatial persistence probability , @xmath34 .",

    "the results obtained in our ( 1 + 1)dimensional numerical investigations are described in detail and discussed in sec .  [ sim ] , for both discrete stochastic solid - on - solid models ( sec .  [ sim]a ) and the spatially discretized ew equation with colored noise ( sec .  [ sim]b ) . sec .",
    "[ concl ] contains a summary of the main results and a few concluding remarks .",
    "we have performed a detailed numerical study of the spatial persistence of ( 1 + 1)dimensional fluctuating interfaces where the dynamics is described by the well known ew equation @xmath35 or alternatively by the kpz equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 refer to spatial derivatives with respect to @xmath2 , and @xmath39 with @xmath40 is the usual uncorrelated random gaussian noise .",
    "the dynamical exponent for eq.([ew ] ) is @xmath41 , and since @xmath42 in our study , the variable @xmath43 defined in sec .",
    "[ intro ] is equal to 1 .",

    "although the kpz equation is nonlinear , characterized by @xmath45 , it is well - known that in the long time limit , the probability distribution of the stochastic height variable @xmath1 in this equation is the same as that in the ew equation ( i.e. @xmath46 $ ] ) in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions .",
    "the static roughness exponent , @xmath47 , is the same ( @xmath48 ) for both cases .",
    "the 1 + 1dimensional kpz model differs from the ew model in the _ transient _ scaling regime where the interfacial roughness grows as a power - law in time , but this temporal regime is not involved in the calculation of the spatial persistence probabilities , as explained in sec .",

    "however , based on the range of values for @xmath59 , we can only infer that @xmath16 varies ( presumably in a continuous manner ) between @xmath60 and @xmath61 as the parameter @xmath59 is increased from 0 to 1/2 . for @xmath42 , this implies a change from the value @xmath62 to @xmath63 , expected to lie between 1/2 and @xmath64 , as @xmath59 changes from 0 to 1/2 . since the value of @xmath15 for @xmath42 goes to 0 as @xmath59 approaches the value 1/2 , it is clear that the values of the two spatial persistence exponents must be different for a general value of @xmath59 in the range [ 0,1/2 ) . this difference would be small for @xmath59 near zero ( the two persistence exponents have the same value for @xmath65 ) , and maximum for @xmath59 near 1/2 .",
    "therefore , the model with @xmath59 substantially different from zero provides a numerically tractable situation where the interesting theoretical prediction of the existence of two different nontrivial spatial persistence exponents can be tested .",

    "the calculation of @xmath102 is relatively simple : it involves measuring the fraction of initial lattice positions ( all possible choices of the initial point are allowed ) for which the interface height has not returned to the height of the initial point ( for persistence probability ) or to the average height level @xmath33 ( for survival probability ) over a distance @xmath2 , averaged over many independent realizations ( @xmath103 ) of the steady state configuration .",
