    "in the last few years the casimir effect has attracted increasing attention due to prospective applications in both fundamental physics and nanotechnology .",
    "sixty years ago h.  b.  g ,  casimir@xcite made his famous discovery that two electrically neutral parallel ideal metal plates spaced at some separation @xmath0 in vacuum attract each other .",
    "casimir explained this effect as due to the alterations in the spectrum of zero - point oscillations of the electromagnetic field introduced by the presence of the plates . in the simplest approach ,",
    "the casimir effect can be described theoretically using quantum field theory with boundary conditions .",
    "the case of real material plates was considered by lifshitz,@xcite who described material properties by means of a frequency - dependent dielectric permittivity .",
    "the lifshitz theory was successfully applied to the interpretation of measurement data in several experiments measuring the casimir force.@xcite    further investigations revealed that the lifshitz theory at nonzero temperature leads to problems when the relaxation of free charge carriers is included in the model of the dielectric response .",
    "this was shown to lead to both thermodynamically and experimental inconsistencies.@xcite@xcite problems arise in the zero - frequency contribution of the lifshitz formula when the free charge carriers are described by the dielectric permittivity of the drude model .",
    "the lifshitz theory was found to be thermodynamically consistent and in agreement with the experimental data if the free electrons in metals are described by the dielectric permittivity of the plasma model.@xcite@xcite for dielectric and semiconductor materials , consistency with thermodynamics and experiment is achieved if the dc conductivity is neglected or charge carriers are described by means of the plasma model depending on whether the concentration of charge carriers is below or above the critical value , respectively.@xcite    recently , an alternative approach to the description of free charge carriers in the lifshitz theory was suggested@xcite@xcite which takes into account screening effects and diffusion currents . within this approach , the macroscopic characteristic of the plate material ( the dielectric permittivity ) is supplemented with a microscopic quantity ( the density of free charge carriers ) .",
    "below we consider the most typical configuration of two thick parallel plates ( semispaces ) and demonstrate that this approach is thermodynamically and experimentally inconsistent .",
    "the reason for this failure is the violation of thermal equilibrium which is the basic applicability condition of the lifshitz theory .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .  2",
    "we briefly formulate problems which arise when the lifshitz theory is applied to materials with nonzero conductivity .",
    "section  3 contains the formulation of approaches taking into account the charge screening of free carriers . in sec .",
    "4 it is demonstrated that these approaches are in conflict with thermodynamics .",
    "section  5 is devoted to the comparison of theoretical results obtained with the inclusion of the screening effects and available experimental data . in sec .",
    "6 the reader will find our conclusions and discussion .",
    "originally , eqs .  ( [ eq1])([eq3 ] )",
    "were mostly applied to dielectrics with the dc conductivity neglected . for such materials the dielectric permittivity can be written in the form@xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are the oscillator frequencies , @xmath13 are the oscillator strengths and @xmath14 are the relaxation parameters . this equation describes the dielectric response of core electrons .",
    "the free energy ( [ eq1 ] ) with the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq4 ] ) is in perfect agreement with thermodynamics .",
    "specifically , the casimir entropy vanishes with temperature.@xcite    problems with thermodynamics arise when the conductivity @xmath15 of the plate material is taken into account . for metals and metallic - type semiconductors",
    "the dielectric permittivity can be modelled by means of the drude model , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the plasma frequency and @xmath18 is the relaxation parameter of free electrons .",
    "simple expressions for the quantities entering eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) are:@xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dc conductivity , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the charge and effective mass of the electron , @xmath23 is the density of charge carriers and @xmath24 is their mobility . the substitution of the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq5 ] ) into eqs .",
    "( [ eq1])([eq3 ] ) results in a negative casimir entropy at @xmath25k depending on @xmath0 for metals with perfect crystal lattices,@xcite which is in violation of the third law of thermodynamics ( the nernst heat theorem ) .",
    "recently it was claimed@xcite that ref .",
    "is wrong because it uses the theory of the normal skin effect for metals with perfect crystal lattices at @xmath26 , while in this situation one must use the theory of the anomalous skin effect .",
    "this objection is , however , incorrect . with the decrease of @xmath8 the application region of the normal skin effect",
    "does become narrower and the application region of the anomalous skin effect widens .",
    "however , at any @xmath27 , there exists a frequency region near zero frequency , where the normal skin effect is applicable . keeping in mind that the violation of the nernst heat theorem originates entirely from the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula ,",
    "one concludes that the permittivity of the normal skin effect is appropriate for the evaluation of this term at low @xmath8 when considering the thermodynamic consistency of the lifshitz theory .",
    "there is a suggestion@xcite to satisfy the nernst heat theorem by the inclusion of impurities , but this does not solve the problem@xcite because according to quantum statistical physics for perfect crystal lattices the casimir entropy at zero temperature must be equal to zero .    another problem is the experimental inconsistency of the lifshitz theory combined with the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "this was demonstrated in a series of three successive experiments on the dynamic determination of the casimir pressure between two gold plates.@xcite@xcite for example , in fig .",
    "1 we demonstrate the comparison between the measurement data of the most precise third experiment@xcite and theoretical casimir pressures computed using the drude model ( [ eq5 ] ) and the generalized plasma - like model of refs .",

    "the solid lines indicate the boundaries of 95% confidence intervals . as is seen in fig .",
    "2(b ) , the theory including the dc conductivity in the dark phase is excluded by the data over a wide separation region , whereas the theory neglecting the dc conductivity is experimentally consistent .    the physical reasons why the use of the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq5 ] ) in the lifshitz theory leads to problems with thermodynamics and experiment are discussed in ref .  .",
    "the point is that this permittivity describes the influence of the drift current of conduction electrons , an irreversible process .",
    "it is accompanied by joule losses and the heating of the casimir plates . to keep the temperature constant",
    ", one should allow the existence of an unidirectional flux of heat from the plates to the heat reservoir.@xcite this is a situation out of thermal equilibrium.@xcite thus , the dielectric permittivity ( [ eq5 ] ) describes processes violating thermal equilibrium which is the basic applicability condition of the lifshitz theory .",
    "it is thus not surprising that in combination with the permittivity ( [ eq5 ] ) , the lifshitz theory becomes thermodynamicly and experimentally inconsistent .",
    "as discussed in sec .  2 , to avoid problems in the application of the lifshitz theory to real materials one should neglect the dc conductivity of dielectrics and describe charge carriers in metals using the generalized plasma - like dielectric permittivity .",
    "another approach to the resolution of problems arising in the lifshitz theory when it is applied to materials with nonzero conductivity is by including the effect of coulomb screening by mobile charges . as discussed above , at nonzero temperature",
    "all materials contain charge carriers which can move through the medium . in the presence of mobile charge carriers the standard coulomb potential of some external charge",
    "is replaced with the so - called _ screened _ coulomb potential having a yukawa - type dependence on separation.@xcite the effect of screening leads to penetration of a static electric field into materials with nonzero conductivity to a depth of the screening length which is very small for good metals ( of order the interatomic distance ) , but can be much larger for semiconductors .",
    "the response of charge carriers to a spatially variable , sinusoidally varying , external electric field taking into account scattering can be described by boltzmann transport equation .",
    "this approach was recently used@xcite to describe the interaction of the fluctuating electromagnetic field with mobile charge carriers in a semiconductor plate and to find the modified reflection coefficients for the tm and te modes .",

    "( [ eq2 ] ) with no screening are reproduced .",
    "this property is preserved in the subsequent limiting transition @xmath59 .",
    "thus , as was already noted above , the violation of the nernst heat theorem is caused by the break of continuity of the reflection coefficients at the point ( 0,0 ) of the @xmath137-plane.@xcite    recently it was claimed@xcite that the nonlocal approach leading to the reflection coefficient ( [ eq9 ] ) with @xmath106 satisfies the nernst theorem , specifically , for solids with ionic conductivity which is the conductivity of activation type . to prove this , ref .",
    "arbitrarily separates the thermal dependence of @xmath20 in eqs  ( [ eq6 ] ) , ( [ eq25 ] ) from the mobility @xmath24 and attributes it to the  effective density of charges , which are able to move \" .",
    "this transfer of the temperature dependence from @xmath24 to @xmath23 is incorrect@xcite because the commonly used density of charge carriers @xmath23 producing the effect of screening in ionic conductors is an independently measured quantity , which does not vanish with @xmath8 .",
    "independent measurements of all three quantities , conductivity , charge carrier concentration and mobility , demonstrate that  mobility has the dominating influence upon the conductivity - temperature dependence\".@xcite nevertheless , ref",
    ".   expresses doubts concerning the existence of dielectric materials whose density of charge carriers does not go to zero when @xmath8 vanishes , while the conductivity goes to zero due to vanishing mobility .",
    "it is common knowledge , however , that for semimetals of the dielectric type the fermi energy is at a band where the density of states is not equal to zero .",
    "the number of charge carriers ( electrons ) near the fermi surface in such dielectric materials is fixed because it is determined by the structure of the crystal lattice .",
    "thus , the density of charge carriers is nonzero at any @xmath8 including @xmath32.@xcite the same holds for certain of the amorphous semiconductors@xcite and for doped semiconductors with dopant concentration below critical .",
    "recent ref .",
    "claims that it explicitly shows the satisfaction of the nernst theorem in the lifshitz theory with the modified reflection coefficients @xmath74 introduced in ref .  .",
    "according to ref .  , the nernst theorem is satisfied  in systems with low density of carriers ( intrinsic semiconductors , dielectrics , etc ) \" .",
    "however , the presented proof uses an assumption that  the carrier density vanishes as @xmath26\".@xcite thus , wide classes of dielectric materials for which the density of charge carriers does not vanish when the temperature vanishes ( doped semiconductors with dopant concentration below critical , semimetals of dielectric type , some amorphous semiconductors and solids with ionic conductivity ) are simply excluded from consideration . as a result , the proof of ref .",
    "is in fact applicable to only insulators and intrinsic semiconductors , where the fermi energy at @xmath32 lies in a band gap . for these materials",
    "the density of states at the fermi energy is equal to zero .",
    "thus , for insulators and intrinsic semiconductors the nernst theorem is satisfied , as was proved above on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ eq29 ] ) .",
    "however , for the majority of dielectric materials @xmath23 does not go to zero with vanishing @xmath8 leading to the violation of the nernst theorem in the modification of the lifshitz theory proposed in ref .   and also in refs .  ,",
    "there is a remark in the literature@xcite that the violation of nernst s theorem for dielectric materials where @xmath23 does not go to zero with vanishing @xmath8 is  a pure misunderstanding \" because  the materials under discussion are amorphous glass - like _ disordered _ bodies \" for which ",
    "nernst s theorem _ is not valid_. \" this remark is erroneous in two aspects .",
    "first , as discussed above , there are dielectric materials with an ordered structure for which @xmath23 does not vanish with @xmath8 ( dielectric like semimetals , for instance ) .",
    "second , the violation of nernst s theorem for disordered bodies is irrelevant to the casimir entropy discussed here . as is correctly stated in ref .",
    ", nonzero entropy of glass plates at @xmath32 is connected with the fact that they are simply not at an equilibrium state at low @xmath8 .",
    "this entropy does not depend on separation between the plates and , thus , is not in contradiction with the nernst theorem . by contrast , the casimir entropy ( [ eq31 ] ) is nonzero and depends on separation distance ( i.e. , on the volume of the system ) for both ordered and disordered materials of plates ( provided @xmath23 does not vanish with @xmath8 ) which is in contradiction with the nernst theorem .",
    "thus , the substitution of the modified reflection coefficients into the lifshitz formula leads to contradictions with thermodynamics .",
    "the physical reason for this is that the lifshitz theory describes a system in thermal equilibrium whereas the modified reflection coefficients were obtained for a system that includes both drift and diffusion currents which are irreversible processes out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "as was emphasized at the beginning of this section , the boltzmann transport equation describes irreversible processes which occur , for instance , in an external electric field .",
    "it is a far reaching extrapolation to apply this equation to the fluctuating electromagnetic field , as is done in ref .  .",
    "in an external electric field the system goes out of thermal equilibrium and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem is violated .",
    "this can not happen and does not happen in the presence of fluctuating electromagnetic fields .",
    "one can conclude that the thermodynamic puzzles discussed above are artifacts of the application of the lifshitz theory and boltzmann transport equation outside of their range of applicability .",
    "the theoretical predictions made by the approaches including screening effects in the lifshitz theory can be compared with the recent experimental results from the measurement of the casimir force between metal - metal and metal - semiconductor test bodies .",
    "in fact all three theoretical approaches@xcite@xcite discussed above lead to almost coincident predictions .",
    "this is because the contributions from the zero frequency term in all these approaches are exactly the same and the contributions from all nonzero matsubara frequencies are approximately equal .",
    "we begin with the most precise experiment on the indirect measurement of the casimir pressure between two gold plates by means of a micromechanical torsional oscillator.@xcite in this experiment , the configuration of a sphere above a plate was used in the dynamic regime to determine the equivalent casimir pressure in the configuration of two plates using the proximity force approximation .",
    "( this experiment was already mentioned in sec .  2 in the comparison between the drude model and the generalized plasma - like model in combination with the standard lifshitz theory . ) note that fig .",
    "1(a ) can be also used to compare the experimental data shown as crosses with the predictions of the theoretical approaches taking screening effects into account.@xcite@xcite the point is that at separations larger than 300 nm the approaches including the screening effects with @xmath88 lead to the same computational results for the casimir pressure as the drude model approach shown as the dark - gray band ( the latter is plotted in the region from 500 to 600 nm ) . as is seen in fig .",
    "1(a ) , the approaches taking into account screening effects are experimentally excluded at a 95% confidence level .    in fig .",
    "3 we use another method of comparison of these theoretical approaches with data over the entire measurement range from 162 to 750 nm . here",
    ", the differences between the theoretical and the mean experimental casimir pressures are shown as dots .",
    "the solid and dashed lines indicate the boundaries of 95% and 99.9% confidence intervals , respectively . as is seen in the figure , the dots are outside the 95% confidence interval over the entire measurement range . at separations from 162 to 640 nm the theoretical approaches including the screening effects are experimentally excluded at the 99.9% confidence level .",
    "recently it was claimed@xcite that the electrostatic calibrations in the experiments of refs .  , do not take into account  important systematic effects \" .",
    "this claim remains unjustified until some specific objection to the calibration procedures of refs .",
    ", described in more detail in refs .  , is presented .",
    "it was claimed also@xcite that the comparison of experiment with theory , like in figs .",
    "1,3 , is irrelevant because the optical properties of the au films used were not measured but taken from tables .",
    "however , computations performed in ref .   demonstrated that the use of any alternative set of optical data only increases disagreement between the drude model approach or approaches of refs .",
    " and the experimental data .",
    "next we compare the theoretical predictions with the inclusion of the screening effects with the measurement data of the experiment on the modulation of the casimir force with light.@xcite ( this experiment was also mentioned in sec .  2 .",
    ") here , the difference of the casimir forces @xmath138 between an au coated sphere and a si plate was measured in the presence , and in the absence , of laser light on the plate . in the absence of light , the concentration of charge carriers in si was much below the critical value , i.e. , si was in a dielectric state . in the presence of light ,",
    "the concentration of charge carriers in si was above the critical value , i.e. , si was in a metallic state ( all values of respective parameters are listed in ref .  ) .",
    "the theoretical predictions with the inclusion of screening effects are numerically almost the same , as in the standard lifshitz theory , for the case when the si plate is in the bright phase , but differ measurably when the si plate is in the dark phase in comparison with the calculation where the conductivity of si in the dark phase is simply neglected ( see sec .  2 ) .",
    "it is not possible , however , to conclusively compare experiment with theory taking the screening effects into account at a 95% confidence level .",
    "below we compare the experimental data whose total experimental errors are determined at a 70% confidence level with the theoretical bands computed with inclusion of screening effects .",
    "note that in the dark phase @xmath106 was used in the computations . in the bright phase the computational results for the casimir force are almost the same for both @xmath106 and @xmath88 .",
    "the width of the bands is found at the same 70% confidence level as the experimental errors .",
    "this width is mostly determined by the error in the charge carrier densities used in the computations . in fig .",
    "4(a , b ) the experimental difference casimir forces , @xmath139 ( the force in the bright phase minus the force in the dark phase ) are shown as crosses for different measurements with absorbed power @xmath140mw and @xmath141mw , respectively .",

    "5(b ) the same data are compared with the same theoretical approach using another method of comparison .    here , theoretical minus experimental differences of the casimir forces are plotted as dots .",
    "the solid line shows the upper boundary of the 70% confidence intervals taking into account all experimental and theoretical errors .",
    "it is seen that below 185 nm and above 280 nm all dots are outside the confidence intervals . as a result ,",
    "4(a , b ) and 5(a , b ) conclusively indicate that the theoretical approaches taking into account screening effects are excluded by the data of the optical modulation experiment@xcite at a 70% confidence level .",
    "in contrast to this conclusion , it was claimed@xcite that `` the experiment can hardly distinguish between nonlocal theory and local theory with zero conductivity of si . ''",
    "( we recall that according to sec .  2 , fig .  2 ,",
    "the local theory with dc conductivity of si neglected in the dark phase is in perfect agreement with the data . )",
    "the comparison between the theoretical and experimental results in ref .",

    "the theoretical band for the nonlocal approach including the screening effects is obtained from the uncertainty in @xmath23 , @xmath144 , determined@xcite at a 95% confidence level .",
    "the reader of ref .   is not informed about the confidence levels used .",
    "this comparison of experiment with theory is thus confusing . in our fig .",
    "4(a ) the same data are compared with the predictions of the nonlocal approach ( the band between the dashed lines ) , where the band width is determined at the same 70% confidence level , i.e. , with @xmath145 , as the errors of the data .",
    "it can be clearly seen that the nonlocal approach is excluded by the data at a 70% confidence level .    regarding fig .",
    "1(b ) in ref .",
    ", it shows both the data and the theoretical bands at a 95% confidence level and restricts the region of separations only from 100 to 150 nm .",
    "however,@xcite these data can not be conclusively compared with the nonlocal approach at such a high confidence .",
    "the correct comparison between the data and the nonlocal approach for this measurement set of the optical modulation experiment over the entire separation range is presented in our fig .",
    "it can be clearly seen that data are inconsistent with the nonlocal approach including the screening effects over a wide range of separations .",
    "in the above , we have reviewed problems with the lifshitz theory when the drift current of conduction electrons in metals , or the dc conductivity at @xmath146 in dielectrics , are included in the model of the dielectric response .",
    "it was shown that these phenomena violate thermal equilibrium which is the basic applicability condition of the lifshitz theory . because of this , the inclusion of the drift current into the lifshitz formula results in thermodynamic and experimental inconsistencies .    the attempts to avoid these problems introduce modified reflection coefficients taking into account screening effects and diffusion currents.@xcite@xcite we show ( see also refs .",
    " ) that the lifshitz formula combined with the modified reflection coefficients leads to nonzero casimir entropy at @xmath32 depending on the separation distance between the plates .",
    "thus , the proposed approaches violate the third law of thermodynamics .",
    "these approaches are also demonstrated to be inconsistent with the measurement data of two experiments . for metal - metal test bodies they are excluded experimentally at a 99.9% confidence level . in the configuration of metal - semiconductor test bodies",
    "the exclusion is confirmed at a 70% confidence level .",
    "the reason for the failure of the theoretical approaches , including the screening effects and diffusion currents into the lifshitz theory , is that these processes violate thermal equilibrium which is the basic applicability condition of the lifshitz theory .",
    "both the drift and diffusion currents are irreversible phenomena which take place out of thermal equilibrium .",
    "by contrast , the dispersion forces are physical phenomena of fluctuating nature which go on in thermal equilibrium .",
    "one arrives at the conclusion that there is a deep difference between external and fluctuating electromagnetic fields which might not be sufficiently reflected in the mathematical formalism of quantum theory .",
