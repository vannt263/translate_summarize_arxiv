    "spectroscopic observations of emission lines in  regions is still a primary source of information of element abundances in the interstellar medium of spiral and irregular galaxies . in the metal - rich inner disks of spirals , however , abundances derived from such measurements",
    "have had considerable uncertainty .",
    "the main reason for this has been the lack of accurate electron temperature estimates , @xmath4 . the reason @xmath4 estimates have remained uncertain for so long is largely due to the fact that the auroral lines on which accurate temperature estimates rely ( e.g. [ o  iii ] @xmath0 , [ n  ii ] @xmath5 , and [ s  iii ] @xmath6 ) , are intrinsically weak and thus difficult to detect .",
    "this difficulty is compounded in high metallicity  regions ( @xmath7 0.5 ( o / h)@xmath8 ) because of increased cooling via ir fine structure lines , which reduces the electron temperature and makes the temperature - sensitive diagnostic line ratios even more difficult to measure .    in the absence of direct temperature measurements ,",
    "past studies of the composition of  regions in spirals have made use of derived relations between o / h and a strong emission line ratio , such as @xmath9 = ( [ o ii]@xmath103727 + [ o  iii]@xmath114959,5007)/h@xmath12 , with the relation often `` calibrated '' at the metal - rich end via predictions of photoionization models ( e.g. , edmunds & pagel 1984 , kewley & dopita 2002 ) .",
    "unfortunately , models for metal - rich nebulae are rather sensitive to details of input parameters ( stellar fluxes , density , dust ) , and so various strong - line calibrations have differed by factors of 2 - 3 or more , provoking considerable debate .",
    "thus , direct temperature measurements would be a valuable resource for understanding the strong - line - o / h relationship .",
    "the local group galaxy m33 is an excellent candidate for studying gas phase element abundances in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "because of its proximity to our own galaxy , wealth of  regions @xcite , and relatively low inclination , it has been the subject of much study over the past 65 years . @xcite",
    "obtained the first spectroscopy of  regions in m33 and found a radial gradient in the strength of [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission lines across the galaxy , and suggested that it could be due to a gradient in excitation .",
    "@xcite was among the first to successfully measure [ o  iii ] @xmath104363 and thus to derive electron temperatures for  regions in several spiral galaxies , including m33 .",
    "this supported the hypothesis of @xcite that a composition gradient , not a gradient in the excitation , was responsible for the radial variation of oxygen forbidden line strengths .    since then several more studies have been carried out concentrating on determining a comprehensive abundance distribution for m33 .",
    "@xcite used the [ o  iii ] @xmath1 and [ o  ii ] @xmath13 line ratios to compute electron temperatures for seven  regions .",
    "they derived an oxygen gradient of 0.13 dex / kpc and noted that ne , n , s , and ar followed essentially the same gradient .",
    "@xcite combined ipcs and ccd observations and derived electron temperatures for [ o  ii ] , [ o  iii ] , and [ s  iii ] for five giant  regions .",
    "they derived a similar oxygen gradient of 0.12 dex / kpc .",
    "@xcite compiled data collected by the above studies and recalculated abundances using updated atomic coefficients , and obtained an oxygen abundance gradient of @xmath14 dex / kpc for m33 .    oxygen and neon are both produced mainly in stars larger than 10 solar masses , which have very short lifetimes . from stellar nucleosynthesis calculations ( e.g. ,",
    "woosley & weaver 1995 ) , it is expected that the abundances of neon and oxygen should trace one another closely ; the chemical evolution calculations of timmes , woosley , & weaver ( 1995 ) , predict that the o / ne ratio varies by no more than 0.1 dex over the range @xmath151.5 @xmath16 [ fe / h ] @xmath16 0.0 ( which corresponds roughly to o / h in the range 0.1 to 1.0 times the solar value ) .",
    "this prediction is supported by measurements of abundances in planetary nebulae ( henry 1990 ) , which show that ne / o is constant over a wide range of o / h .",
    "however , @xcite derived neon abundances for 25  regions in m33 from infrared spectroscopy of [ ne  ii ] and [ ne  iii ] fine structure lines using the @xmath17 , and reported a ne / h gradient ( @xmath18 dex / kpc ) that is significantly shallower than the o / h gradient obtained from the visible - light measurements .",
    "the implication is that either set of measurements is in error , or that the ne / o ratio across m33 varies by 0.5 dex over a factor ten in o / h . in this paper , we report visible - light ccd spectroscopy of  regions in m33 to directly measure electron temperatures , and if possible to resolve the discrepancy between the results from infrared and visible - light spectra .",
    "spectra of 13  regions were obtained on september 27 - 29 , 1992 using the mayall 4 m telescope at kitt peak national observatory .",
    "the data were taken using the r - c ccd spectrograph with a spectral range of 3600 - 5100   at approximately 2   resolution with a slit width of 18 .",
    "the long slit of the spectrograph was often oriented so that multiple  regions could be observed at once .",
    "risley prisms were used to compensate for not being at the parallactic angle .",
    "a list of the  regions observed for this study is given in table 1 .",
    "it presents the coordinates for the center of each object , the position angle of the slit in degrees measured from north through east , and the deprojected distance of each  region from the nucleus .",
    "the coordinates were measured from mosaic h@xmath19 imaging of m33 obtained by massey et al . for the survey of resolved stellar content of local group galaxies .",
    "we assumed a distance of 832 kpc to m33 @xcite , an inclination angle of 56@xmath20 and a position angle of 23@xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the nucleus of m33 was measured to be ra = 1@xmath21 33@xmath22 50.9@xmath23 , dec = + 30@xmath24 39@xmath25 37@xmath262 ( j2000 ) from the mosaic h@xmath19 image .",
    "the data reduction followed standard procedures .",
    "we divided a normalized two - dimensional flat field , constructed using a combination of quartz lamp exposures to derive the pixel - to - pixel sensitivity variations plus a twilight sky exposure to correct for vignetting , into each spectrum .",
    "comparison of the normalized flat field frames taken at different times during the run showed that the flat fields were reproducible to a level of about 0.6% r.m.s .",
    "the spectra were rectified and placed on a wavelength scale using exposures of a he - ne - ar lamp ; a cubic fit to the dispersion data gave residuals of approximately 0.2   r.m.s .",
    "flux calibration of the spectra was performed using observations of the spectrophotometric standard stars wolf 1346 , bd+28 4200 , feige 110 , g191b2b , hiltner 600 , and feige 34 , all of which were observed at least once during the course of each night .",
    "we derived the instrument sensitivity function by fitting a low - order spline fit to the standard star measurements .",
    "we corrected all of the standards and object spectra for atmospheric extinction using mean kpno extinction coefficients .",
    "since the data were taken through a narrow slit , absolute spectrophotometry was not possible , and we averaged the various standard star sensitivity measurements at each wavelength to derive the sensitivity function . based on the residuals of the data from the fit , the relative calibration across the spectrum is good to about 2.5% .",
    "emission line strengths were measured using the splot task in iraf s onedspec package .",
    "the emission lines were fit with gaussian profiles and integrated in order to obtain a measurement of the flux .",
    "a linear background was also fit and subtracted from the profile . in the instance when two lines overlapped but were still resolved ( e.g. the [ o  iii ] @xmath27 and @xmath28 lines ) , the line strengths were deblended by fitting the profiles concurrently with the constraint that both lines be fit with the same fwhm .",
    "interstellar reddening toward each  region was determined by comparing observed hydrogen balmer emission line ratios to the theoretical balmer decrement of hummer and storey ( 1987 ) .",
    "the average interstellar extinction curve , @xmath29 , was taken from savage and mathis ( 1979 ) .",
    "we corrected the balmer line strengths for underlying photospheric absorption by incrementing the equivalent width of stellar absorption in 0.1    intervals from 0.1   to 3.0  . for each value of the equivalent width",
    ", we determined the logarithmic reddening coefficient , @xmath30 , for the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 line ratios , giving us three independent estimates for @xmath30 .",
    "the adopted value for the equivalent width of underlying absorption was chosen such that the dispersion in @xmath30 for each object was minimized .",
    "the weighted mean of the three logarithmic reddening coefficients was then computed and used to correct the line strengths for interstellar reddening .",
    "the error in the weighted mean was taken as the uncertainty .",
    "the dereddened emission line strengths for each object are listed in tables 2 and 3 .",
    "the adopted logarithmic reddening coefficient and the equivalent width of underlying photospheric absorption are also listed for each object .",
    "the method by which we computed the uncertainties in the dereddened line strengths and the logarithmic reddening coefficients is described in section 3.3 .",
    "electron temperatures , densities , and ionic abundances were computed using the n - level atom code found in iraf s nebular package , a detailed description of which can be found in @xcite .",
    "this code is based upon the five - level atom code of @xcite , but is more robust in that it allows for more than five levels for most ions .",
    "table 4 lists the derived measurements or upper limits for electron density , @xmath34 , estimated from the [ o  ii ] @xmath35 line ratio .",
    "all @xmath34 calculations were performed using the iraf task temden , assuming an electron temperature of 10,000 k. all but one of the observed  regions ( bclmp691 ) had an [ o  ii ] line ratio with a @xmath36 uncertainty which included the theoretical low density limit . as a result , we computed @xmath37 upper limits for @xmath34 for all sources but bclmp691 based on the formal uncertainties in the dereddened [ o  ii ] line ratios .",
    "the derived estimates and upper limits for @xmath34 place all of the  regions in the low density regime ( @xmath38@xmath39 ) .    the commonly used [ o  iii ] @xmath1 line ratio was the only diagnostic available for deriving the electron temperature .",
    "of the 13 spectra collected , six contained a detectable [ o  iii ] @xmath0 line .",
    "we were thus able to compute electron temperatures for just under half of the  regions observed .",
    "electron temperatures were computed by again using the iraf task temden assuming an electron density of @xmath34 = 100 @xmath39 .",
    "table 4 lists the derived values for t[o  iii ] along with their uncertainties .",
    "we estimated ion abundances for the six  regions which had a t[o  iii ] measurement .",
    "table 5 lists the ionic abundances which we were able to derive : o@xmath40 , o@xmath41 , and ne@xmath41 , along with their uncertainties .",
    "all abundance calculations were performed using the iraf task ionic .",
    "abundances for o@xmath40 and o@xmath41 were computed using the summed line ratios of [ o  ii ] @xmath42 and [ o  iii ] @xmath43 respectively .",
    "abundances for ne@xmath41 were computed using the [ ne  iii ] @xmath44 line .",
    "all of the regions studied have electron densities too low for collisional de - excitation of the forbidden lines to be important .",
    "we assumed a two - zone model for the electron temperature structure for the abundance calculations . from ionization models",
    ", @xcite found that the temperatures in the ne@xmath41 and o@xmath41 zones were essentially equal ; therefore , we used t[o  iii ] to compute abundances for o@xmath41 and ne@xmath41 , while for o@xmath45 we used estimates for t[o  ii ] based on the relation between t(o@xmath45 ) and t(o@xmath41 ) from @xcite and @xcite , @xmath46 where @xmath47 .",
    "( in this format , temperatures specified by the ionic species , e.g. t(o@xmath41 ) , refer to the ion - weighted average temperature for that species , while temperatures specified by spectroscopic notation , e.g. t[o  iii ] , refer to temperatures computed directly from the spectra . )",
    "table 5 also lists the total element abundances for neon and oxygen along with their uncertainties .",
    "we assumed that all of the oxygen and neon was either in the singly or doubly ionized state , except in the case of the two newly identified he  ii emitting regions .",
    "for those objects , we assumed that o@xmath48/o @xmath49 he@xmath41/he , based on the similarity in their ionization potentials .",
    "this should be an accurate approximation when the he@xmath41 fraction is small , and we indeed find that only a very small fraction ( 3% for bclmp090 and 6% for ma1 ) of oxygen is triply ionized in these regions .",
    "the ionization fraction for ne@xmath48 is even smaller because of its larger ionization potential .",
    "if we assume that the emission is optically thin , the total element abundance is equal to the sum of the singly and doubly ionized components .",
    "this computation is easily carried out for oxygen .",
    "neon , however , presents a problem because [ ne  ii ] is not seen in the visible spectrum .",
    "total element abundances for neon were therefore estimated by computing an ionization correction using photoionization models from @xcite .",
    "for the purposes of this study we did used a subset of their model grid : we used the instantaneous burst models with salpeter imf and upper stellar mass limit 120 solar masses ( model sequences ikf , iki , and ikl ) .",
    "these model sequences were further restricted to those with refractory elements depleted onto grains ( depletion = 0.1 times the normal values ) .",
    "figure 1 is a plot of @xmath50 vs. @xmath51 as predicted by the photoionization models , where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "according to the models , for @xmath54 , the ratio @xmath50 is approximately one .",
    "therefore , we assume @xmath55 to add additional points and better constrain the neon and oxygen abundance gradients , we included several  regions having electron temperature measurements from @xcite . to be consistent in the atomic data used , we re - computed electron temperatures and abundances for the @xcite objects in the same way as for our new sample . for all but two of the vlchez sources",
    ", there was an [ o  iii ] @xmath1 line ratio available for computing t[o  iii ] .",
    "for the two sources , ngc595 and ma2 , where t[o  iii ] could not be measured , the [ s  iii ] @xmath56 and [ o  ii ] @xmath13 line ratios were employed respectively to derive electron temperatures . for ma2 , we used the calibration , @xmath57 derived in @xcite to estimate @xmath58 .",
    "table 6 lists the measured electron temperature along with the deprojected distance from the nucleus of each  region in the vlchez study from which an electron temperature could be measured .",
    "table 7 lists the ion and element abundances for those sources .",
    "uncertainties in the line fluxes , @xmath59 , were computed by adding in quadrature the statistical uncertainty introduced by the photon noise , @xmath60 , the uncertainty in the flat fielding correction , @xmath61 , and the uncertainty in the photometric calibration , @xmath62 , @xmath63 the statistical uncertainty was estimated from the noise in the continuum using the formula ( prez - montero & daz 2003 ) , @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the r.m.s .",

    "uncertainty in the flat field was approximately 0.6% , determined by comparing flat field exposures taken at different times during the run .",

    "this distribution can then be populated by means of a monte carlo simulation which generates deviates drawn from a gaussian distribution .",
    "the method used to compute the deviates is described in section 5.4 of @xcite .",
    "we populated each distribution with 10,000 deviates and fed them into the n - level atom code to produce a corresponding distribution of electron temperatures .",
    "because of the logarithmic dependence of @xmath4 on its diagnostic line ratio , the temperature distributions were asymmetric and skewed such that the expectation value for a distribution was offset from the value computed directly from the line ratio .",
    "the line ratios with the largest uncertainties yielded the most highly skewed and biased temperature distributions .",
    "for bclmp706 this offset was most prominent ( @xmath74 @xmath15500 k ) ; bclmp745 and ma2 also had large offsets ( @xmath74 @xmath15400 k ) .",
    "the rest of the  regions had small temperature offsets ( @xmath16 200 k ) .",
    "we therefore chose to determine the expectation values for the temperature distributions from the histogram of each distribution .",
    "note that in the case of the largest @xmath75 difference ( bclmp706 ) , the change in o / h is less than 0.1 dex .    because the temperature distributions were asymmetric , using a single gaussian to characterize the uncertainty in an electron temperature measurement was not appropriate .",
    "we therefore used the expectation value to divide the distribution into two sections .",
    "deviates less than the expectation value were used to characterize the negative error and deviates greater than the expectation value were used to characterize the positive error .",
    "we assumed that the profile in each case could be modeled by one - half of a gaussian profile , and used a fit to determine the one - sided standard deviation for the distribution on either side of the expectation value .",
    "the two values for the standard deviation thus derived were taken to be the negative and positive uncertainties for @xmath75 .",
    "the uncertainty in the ionic abundances were computed using the same technique . the total error in these measurements , however , came from two sources : the error in the emission line flux ( which we assume is normally distributed ) and the error in the electron temperature ( which has a skewed distribution as described above ) .",
    "we therefore modeled the abundance errors with a monte carlo analysis , feeding in both sources of error .",
    "the resulting uncertainties are those listed in tables 5 and 7 .",
    "we report here the discovery of two new examples of  regions that emit nebular he  ii @xmath104686 emission in m33 .",
    "nebular he  ii emission is a phenomenon seen in only a handful of regions in local group galaxies ( garnett et al .",
    "no single cause has been identified for the source of the he  ii emission in such objects ; he  ii emission has been observed in nebulae associated with wo and peculiar wn stars , high - mass x - ray binaries , and in one case with an otherwise ordinary mid - o type main sequence star ( pakull & angebault 1986 ; stasiska et al .",
    "1986 ; garnett et al . 1991 ; garnett et al .",
    "2000 ) . to date , these he  ii nebulae have been found primarily in metal - poor dwarf irregular galaxies , except for the galactic wolf - rayet bubble g2.4 + 1.4 associated with the wo star wr 102 ( dopita et al . 1990 ) .",
    "narrow he  ii emission has also been found in a number of metal - poor dwarf starburst galaxies , as catalogued in schaerer , contini , & pindao ( 1999 ) .",
    "the two objects discovered in this study are the first he  ii nebulae identified in a spiral galaxy beyond the milky way .",
    "the first new he  ii region in m33 is bclmp090 , a small , relatively faint  region about 1 kpc from the center of the galaxy .",
    "bclmp090 has a diameter of roughly 7@xmath76 as measured from the h@xmath19 image from the mosaic survey of local group galaxies .",
    "the nebular morphology consists of a knot on the northwest side , opening out into a ring toward the southeast .",
    "its diameter of about 30 pc clearly shows that this is not a planetary nebula .",

    "the high [ o  iii ] @xmath105007/h@xmath12 ratio of 6.6 ( see table 2 ) is very uncharacteristic of  regions with similar o / h , providing further support for the high excitation and ionization state of bclmp090 .    because of the narrow spectrograph slit used , we are not able to measure total @xmath104686 and h@xmath12 fluxes very accurately .",

    "the second he  ii nebula we identified is ma 1 , the outermost known  region in m33 .",

    "the regions of nebular he  ii emission and the position of the wn star are marked .",
    "it is notable from figures 3 and 4 that the nebular he  ii emission is not strongest at the position of the w - r star , but rather at the position of the ob cluster , more than 30 pc away . while it is not possible to completely rule out that the w - r star is powering the he  ii emission , the poor spatial correlation argues strongly against the w - r star being the source of he@xmath40-ionizing photons .",
    "we conclude that the he  ii nebula is powered by a source(s ) within the ob star cluster .",
    "this distinction is significant , as narrow ( presumed nebular ) he  ii emission is often associated with the presence of wolf - rayet stars ( e.g. , izotov et al .",

    "( 1991 ) for other he  ii nebulae .",
    "a more precise value would require a measurement of the he  ii flux over the entire emission region .",
    "such measurements are desirable to accurately determine the he  ii luminosities and to constrain the parameters of the ionizing stars .    given the lack of association between the he  ii emission in ma  1 and the w - r star , it is not possible at present to identify the likely source powering the he  ii emission .",
    "the @xmath84 observations of m33 show no x - ray point source at the location of ma  1 ( pietsch et al .",

    "these two data sets give o / h gradient slopes ( @xmath150.03@xmath900.01 for our data vs. @xmath150.004@xmath900.03 for the vlchez et al .",
    "points ) and zeropoints ( @xmath153.62@xmath900.05 vs. @xmath153.55@xmath900.13 ) that agree to within 1@xmath91 ; similarly , we find agreement to within 1.3@xmath91 for the ne / h gradients .",
    "therefore , although there appears to be a slight systematic offset between the two data sets , the offset is statistically insignificant , and we combine the two sets of points to estimate the o / h and ne / h gradients for this and all subsequent discussion in this paper .",
    "the dashed lines in figure 5 represent the resulting o and ne abundance gradients based on a weighted linear least squares fit to the combined data from this study and the five points from vlchez et al .",
    "the least squares fit for the o / h gradient is @xmath3 dex / kpc and the least squares fit for the ne / h gradient is @xmath2 dex / kpc .",
    "the newly - derived o / h and ne / h gradients are in good agreement with each other ( within 1 @xmath91 ) .",
    "@xcite used the [ ne  ii ] 12.81 @xmath92 m and [ ne  iii ] 15.56 @xmath92 m fine structure lines with radio continuum measurements to measure ne abundances in m33 .",
    "these measurements have the advantage of being almost completely temperature independent because both the fine structure lines and the thermal continuum have similar temperature dependences . from their sample of 25  regions",
    "@xcite derived a ne / h gradient of @xmath18 dex / kpc .",
    "our new measurement of the ne and o gradients are now only slightly more than 1@xmath91 from the @xcite results .    our new oxygen gradient is much shallower than previous studies have indicated .",
    "@xcite recompiled data from several studies in the literature @xcite which measured oxygen abundances in  regions .",
    "they computed an oxygen gradient of @xmath14 dex / kpc for m33 .",
    "we note that many of the  regions in these studies did not have measured electron temperatures , necessitating the use of a calibration of the strong [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] lines vs. o / h to estimate abundances ( edmunds & pagel 1984 ) .",
    "several recent studies ( castellanos et al . 2002 ; kennicutt , bresolin , & garnett 2003 ; bresolin , garnett , & kennicutt 2004 ) have now derived @xmath75 , from measurements of [ n  ii ] and [ s  iii ] line ratios , in a number of metal - rich  regions in ngc 1232 , m101 , and m51 .",
    "these studies have found  regions with o / h as high as the solar value or slightly higher .",
    "they have also shown that abundances based on directly measured electron temperatures are significantly smaller ( 0.3 - 0.5 dex ) than those derived from various strong - line o / h calibrations .",
    "our new results for  regions in m33 are consistent with these other studies , implying that the inner disk in m33 is not as metal - rich as previously thought .",
    "we should emphasize , however , that we have measured abundances for only one object within 2 kpc of the nucleus of m33 .",
    "in figure 6 we display both the neon abundances derived in the present study and those derived by willner & nelson - patel ( 2002 ) .",
    "the solid and dashed lines are the weighted least squares fits to the willner & nelson - patel data and our data , respectively .",
    "the two fits show an offset in ne / h , such that the willner & nelson - patel data are approximately 0.2 dex higher than the results from the visible spectra ; this difference is significant at more than the 3@xmath91 level .",
    "if we remove bclmp745 , the  region with the lowest neon abundance level , this result is largely unaffected because of the relatively large uncertainty associated with this measurement .",
    "we disregard the difference in slope of the neon gradients because of the large error in the value of the slope .    what could be the source of this difference ?",
    "one possibility that we considered was that the ionization corrections that we used to derive the neon abundances were inaccurate , as they were estimated from photoionization models ; the fractional ionization of ne@xmath41 is very sensitive to the stellar radiation field beyond 40 ev , which is still relatively uncertain for o star model atmospheres .",
    "if the ionization corrections we used were systematically too small , then we might expect to see an offset in @xmath93 between our data set and those measured by willner & nelson - patel ( 2002 ) , since our  regions should have similar ionization on average .",
    "figure 7 plots @xmath93 as a function of galactocentric radius for our data set and those from willner & nelson - patel ( 2002 ) .",
    "the figure shows that there is no systematic difference in @xmath93 between the two studies .",
    "the one exception is bclmp090 , which is a he  ii nebula and thus has a higher ne ionization than expected for  regions ionized by normal o and b stars .",
    "the results in figure 7 suggest that ionization corrections are probably not the source of the offset in neon abundance .",
    "another possibility is that the electron temperature measurements for this study were biased towards higher values , leading to an underestimation of the metallicity .",
    "@xcite has shown that in photoionization models for high metallicity  regions ( log(o / h ) @xmath7 -3.4 ) , oxygen abundances based on direct measurements of electron temperatures derived from [ o  iii ] line ratios could lead to biased oxygen abundance estimates .",
    "this is brought about by temperature gradients within a nebula that are the result of strong cooling by [ o  iii ] and [ n  iii ] fine - structure lines .",
    "the effect of the bias is that abundances can be underestimated by as much as 0.2 dex when the true o / h is approximately solar ( log o / h = 3.3 ) .",
    "however , this bias is very small at lower o / h , and so would not explain the difference we see between the ir and visible - light measurements at low o / h .",
    "a related possibility is that of temperature fluctuations ( peimbert 1967 ) , wherein fluctuations in @xmath75 lead to a derived temperature that is too high ( and thus abundances that are too low ) compared to the average temperature .",
    "whether temperature fluctuations large enough to affect abundances are present in photoionized nebulae is still a subject of debate ( see e.g. , mathis 1995 , liu 2002 ) .    while the discrepancy we see in ne / h is of concern",
    ", we should emphasize that the optical data comprise only a small set , and we still do not have enough data points in the inner disk of m33 to constrain the ne and o gradients particularly well .",
    "a larger data set should settle the nature of the discrepancy .",
    "a program is under way to collect new optical spectroscopy from the ground and ir spectroscopy with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ to evaluate the discrepancy we see here .",
    "figure 8 displays the radial distribution of o / h from all of the  regions discussed in this paper ( _ filled squares _ ) , along with o / h measurements from spectroscopy of b supergiants from monteverde , herrero , & lennon ( 2001 ; _ stars _ ) .",
    "monteverde et al .",
    "noted that the supergiant abundances were in reasonable agreement with the results of vlchez et al .",
    "nevertheless , from examination of figure 8 we can say that the radial trend in o / h based on the supergiants is not discordant with what we find , either .",
    "this is undoubtedly a result of the relatively large uncertainties in the oxygen abundances",
    ". many more spectroscopic measurements of stars and  regions in m33 are needed to properly compare the independent results from stellar and gas abundance studies .",
    "a number of important astrophysical relations ( such as the cepheid period - luminosity relation and the i(co ) - n(h@xmath94 ) relation ) have , or may have , a significant dependence on metallicity . the metallicity dependence in many cases",
    "is derived using abundances derived from  regions .",
    "kennicutt , bresolin , & garnett ( 2003 ) noted that the derived metallicity dependence for such relations would steepen considerably if metallicity gradients in spiral galaxies are flatter than usually supposed , as found in their paper , and in the present work .",
    "here we revisit briefly the correlation between wolf - rayet star properties and metallicity .",
    "it has long been known that the relative number of wc - type and wn - type wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars varies with galactrocentric distance within m33 , with the center richer in those of type wc ( massey & conti 1983 , massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "this has been taken to be a demonstration of the importance of stellar winds on the evolution of massive stars ; stars with higher initial oxygen abundances will have a higher mass - loss rate , and it will hence be easier to produce wc stars ( massey & johnson 1998 ) .",
    "the trend observed within m33 also extends to such low metallicity galaxies such as the smc , and to the metal - rich galaxy m31 ( massey 2003 ) .",
    "a similar trend is seen with metallicity in the relative number of wrs and red supergiants ( massey 2003 ) .",
    "modern stellar evolutionary theory does a good job of predicting the trend , at least for the relative number of wcs and wns ( massey 2003 , meynet & maeder 2005 ) .",
    "figure 9 shows an updated version of figure 11 from massey ( 2003 ) , showing the relationship between the wc / wn number ratio and the mean o / h .",
    "the filled circles represent averages over galaxies or regions within the galaxies ; see massey ( 2003 ) and massey & johnson ( 1998 ) for a complete description of the data for this figure .",
    "the oxygen abundances for several galaxies in this plot have been updated with new values from the following sources : lmc and smc ( garnett 1999 ) ; m33 ( this work ) ; milky way ( deharveng et al . 2000 ) . with the exception of the data point for m31 ,",
    "all of the abundances for the galaxies in figure 9 have been derived directly from measurements of the electron temperature ; the three points for m33 refer to o / h values determined from the least squares fit at 0.8 kpc , 2 kpc , and 5 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "the m31 metallicity , in contrast , was derived from the strong [ o  ii ] and [ o  iii ] emission lines using a relation that is calibrated largely with photoionization models .",
    "we also plot in figure 9 the recent results for the metallicity dependence of the wc / wn ratio from meynet & maeder ( 2005 ) , who computed the effects of rotation on mixing and stellar evolution .",
    "the predicted relationship between wc / wn and o / h is depicted by the region bounded by the dotted line ( see also figure 11 of meynet & maeder 2005 ) .",
    "the bounds of the region reflect the fact that stars likely exhibit a range of rotation speeds ; the upper bound of the region represents main sequence stars rotating at 300 km s@xmath80 , while the lower bound represents non - rotating stars .",
    "we see that our new abundance values for m33 are still consistent with the predicted correlation ( keeping in mind that the wc / wn ratio for the galaxy is likely to be overestimated because of incompleteness for wn stars  see massey 2003 ) .",
    "while this is reassuring , we note that the m31 data has a much greater impact on the slope of the correlation .",
    "the fact that the m31 abundances were derived with a different method raises some concern ; as we have noted above , recent measurements of electron temperatures for metal - rich  regions yield significantly smaller abundances than strong - line calibrations .",
    "furthermore , analyses by venn et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and smartt et al .",
    "( 2001 ) of four supergiants in m31 does suggest an oxgyen abundance similar to that of the solar neighborhood , approximately 0.3 dex lower .",
    "we have illustated this by the unfilled circle for m31 in figure 9 , in which case the correlation between wc / wn and o / h would be considerably steeper .",
    "note , however , that the wc / wn ratio for the milky way is likely too large due to selection effects ( massey & johnson 1998 ) . a new , deep spectroscopic study of  regions ( and young massive stars ) in m31 would be worthwhile to evaluate this question .",
