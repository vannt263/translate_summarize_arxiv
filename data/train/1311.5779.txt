    "energetic particles are prevalent throughout the universe , ranging from mev particles in the heliosphere to tev particles in supernova remnants to eev particles that almost certainly originate beyond our own galaxy . at low energies within the heliosphere",
    "they are detected by satellites , while at high energies they arrive at the earth as cosmic rays ( cr ) .",
    "cr in distant objects are detected from radio to @xmath0-ray wavebands by means of electron synchrotron and inverse compton emission or @xmath0-ray emission from pion - producing collisions between cosmic rays and background protons .",
    "the presence of cr in snr with energies of 100s of tev is proved by the detection at the earth of @xmath0-rays with energies up to nearly 100tev arriving from the direction of the source ( aharonian et al 2007 , 2011 ) .",
    "particle acceleration is known to be efficient because the galactic cosmic ray energy density can only be generated if a significant fraction of the energy of supernova explosions is given to energetic particles .",
    "blandford and eichler ( 1987 ) estimate an efficiency of a few percent",
    ". initial explanations of cr acceleration centred on the second order fermi process ( fermi 1949 ) by which cr gain energy from elastic collisions with magnetic field structures in motion in the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "if the typical velocity of a magnetic structure is @xmath1 , the excess probability of a cr encountering it head - on rather than tail - on is proportional to @xmath2 with a fractional increase in cr energy of order @xmath2 on a head - on encounter , so the process is second order in @xmath2 .",
    "the second order process probably contributes to particle acceleration , but it was realised in the late 1970s that a more rapid first order process , known as diffusive shock acceleration ( dsa ) , occurs wherever there are strong releases of energy that produce blast waves ( krymsky 1977 , axford et al 1977 , bell 1978 , blandford & ostriker 1978 ) .",
    "cr diffusion back and forth across a strong shock produces a fractional energy gain of order @xmath2 on each crossing where @xmath1 is the shock velocity . on average",
    "each cr crosses the shock @xmath3 times before escaping downstream of the shock , with a probability @xmath4 of escaping after at least @xmath5 shock crossings .",
    "a simple derivation shows that a @xmath6 differential energy spectrum arises naturally from dsa at a strong shock .",
    "its advantages as a theoretical explanation of particle acceleration are that a large part of a supernova energy release is processed through the expanding shock front , the energy spectrum matches observation reasonably well , and high acceleration efficiency appears likely .",
    "the conclusion was soon drawn that dsa at supernova shocks is probably the main source of galactic cr .",
    "the highest energy ( eev ) cr may possibly be produced in agn , radio galaxies or grb where much of the available energy is processed through high velocity shocks or shocks with a large spatial extent .",
    "dsa offers a generic explanation of astrophysical particle acceleration , but the explanation has not been , and still is not , completely straightforward . in two crucial papers , lagage & cesarsky ( 1983a , b ) reasoned that dsa at snr shocks appeared incapable of accelerating protons to pev energies .",
    "since the galactic cr energy spectrum extends from gev to a few pev as a nearly straight power law , it seems necessary that the same mechanism accelerating cr to tev should also be accelerating cr from tev to pev . because the spectrum steepens rather than flattens in a ` knee ' at a few pev",
    "the spectrum beyond the knee can not easily be explained as the coincidental meeting of different populations above and below the knee .",
    "so the same process is probably responsible for cr acceleration beyond the knee , although the problem is alleviated if cr beyond the knee are heavy nuclei rather than protons .",
    "this review is principally concerned with the particular question of whether supernova remnants ( snr ) accelerate cr to the knee in the galactic energy spectrum at a few pev .",
    "more broadly based reviews of diffusive shock acceleration or with a different focus can be found in drury ( 1983 ) , blandford & eichler ( 1987 ) , jones & ellison ( 1991 ) , malkov & drury ( 2001 ) and bell ( 2013 ) .",
    "in dsa at a strong shock propagating at velocity @xmath1 the cr energy increases on average by a fraction @xmath2 each time the cr cycles from upstream to downstream and back to upstream . consequently a cr must cross the shock typically @xmath7 times for acceleration from energy @xmath8 to @xmath9 .",
    "krymsky ( 1979 ) derived a time @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the cr mean free path and @xmath12 is the downstream velocity relative to the shock , for cr to cycle between upstream and downstream . allowing for different conditions upstream and downstream , the complete mean cycle time between upstream and downstream is @xmath13/c$ ] ( lagage & cesarsky ( 1983a , b ) ) where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the upstream and downstream cr diffusion coefficients respectively , and @xmath16 for a strong shock .",
    "the ratio of @xmath17 to the age of the snr indicates that cr reach a maximum energy of typically @xmath18 , which falls 100 times short of the energy of the knee .",
    "the lagage & cesarsky limit can be derived as follows .",
    "balance between diffusion away from the shock upstream and advection back to the shock at velocity @xmath1 creates an exponential cr precursor upstream of the shock with a scaleheight @xmath19 .",
    "the number of cr in the precursor per unit shock area is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the cr number density at the shock .",
    "cr cross the shock at a rate @xmath22 so the average time a cr spends upstream between crossings is @xmath23 . the time spent downstream is similarly @xmath24 giving the total cycle time . at each cycle",
    "the cr energy increases by a fraction @xmath2 on average so the characteristic time for energy gain is @xmath25 .",
    "blasi & amato ( 2012 ) find best fits for the galactic diffusion coefficient of the form @xmath26 @xmath27 with @xmath28 for @xmath29 or @xmath30 for @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the height of the galactic halo in kpc .",
    "if these diffusion coefficients were to apply to diffusive shock acceleration in snr expanding at 5000 @xmath33 the acceleration time at gev energies would be @xmath34 .",
    "it would take an impossibly long time for cr to reach pev energies , between @xmath35 and @xmath36 , by which time the shock would have slowed substantially ( @xmath37 ) or dissolved into the interstellar medium .",
    "the long estimated acceleration time reflects the large mean free path for cr scattering in the interstellar medium .",
    "fortunately , the large currents of streaming cr close to the snr excite plasma instabilities that drive fluctations in the magnetic field and increase cr scattering .",
    "two especially effective cr - driven plasma instabilities are a resonant instability ( lerche 1967 , kulsrud & pearce 1969 , wentzel 1974 , skilling 1975a , b , c and bell 1978 ) , in which the cr resonantly excite alfven waves , and a non - resonant instability ( bell 2004 ) , in which a purely growing mode is strongly driven under conditions found in young snr . throughout this paper",
    "the first of these two instabilities will be referred to as the ` alfven instability ' because it drives alfven waves .",
    "the second instability will be referred to as the ` non - resonant hybrid ( nrh ) instability ' because the mode is not spatially resonant with the cr larmor radius and because it is hybrid in the sense that kinetic cr interact with a fluid background plasma .",
    "these instabilities will be discussed below .",
    "other instabilities such as the drury instability ( drury & falle 1986 ) , the firehose instability , and other long wavelength instabilities ( bykov et al 2011 , reville & bell 2012 , 2013 , schure & bell 2011 ) probably also play a role in perturbing the upstream magnetic field and reducing the diffusion coefficient .",
    "additionally , magnetic field amplification may take place downstream of the shock due to vorticity induced by density inhomogeneities in the plasma overtaken by the shock ( giacalone & jokipii ( 2007 ) ; zirakshvili & ptuskin ( 2008 ) ) but amplification may occur too far downstream to contribute to cr acceleration at the shock ( guo et al 2012 ) .",
    "plasma instabilities can generate magnetic structures that scatter cr , but the mean free path for scattering in a magnetic field can not be smaller than the larmor radius @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the cr momentum and @xmath40 is the magnetic field upstream of the shock in tesla .",
    "the upstream diffusion coefficient @xmath14 is consequently at least @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the energy in ev .",
    "the perpendicular component of the magnetic field is compressed by a factor of four at the shock so a reasonable assumption is that @xmath43 within a numerical factor of order one .",
    "if @xmath44 the downstream cycle time @xmath45 is equal to the upstream cycle time @xmath23 and the total cycle time is @xmath46 . under this assumption ,",
    "the characteristic time for energy gain is @xmath47 .",
    "setting the acceleration time equal to the snr expansion time @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the snr radius gives a maximum energy @xmath50ev , which is equivalent to @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the magnetic field in microgauss , @xmath53 is the snr radius in parsec , and @xmath54 is the shock velocity in @xmath55 . for cas",
    "a , @xmath56 and @xmath57 , giving @xmath58 for a typical interstellar magnetic field of @xmath59 .",
    "similarly for tycho s snr , @xmath60 assuming @xmath61 and @xmath62 ( following williams et al 2013 ) .",
    "@xmath63 falls far short of the knee for both these snr , thus illustrating the challenge posted by lagage & cesarsky ( 1983a , b ) to dsa as an explanation of galactic cr acceleration .",
    "these estimates of @xmath63 are further reduced by a factor of three if the diffusion coefficient is set to @xmath64 instead of the probably extreme @xmath65 assumed above .    in the sedov phase of snr expansion the radius increases but the shock velocity decreases such that @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the energy of a sedov blast wave expanding into a medium of density @xmath68 .",
    "this implies that the maximum cr energy decreases during the sedov phase : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is in units of @xmath71 and @xmath72 is the ambient density in @xmath73 .",
    "cr may be accelerated to higher energy if they are able to stay with the shock throughout the sedov phase and gain energy continually , but such high energy cr are few in number because the probability of staying with the shock for a long time is very small , and their final energy is not much increased beyond their energy at the start of the sedov phase .",
    "the difficulties posed by lagage & cesarsky are clearly seen to be stringent when it is recognised that the bohm diffusion coefficient @xmath74 is a lower limit for cr diffusion along magnetic field lines .",
    "two conditions must hold for bohm diffusion to apply .",
    "firstly , fluctuations in the magnetic field @xmath75 must be at least comparable in magnitude with any mean field , @xmath76 .",
    "secondly , the scalelength of the fluctuations must match the cr larmor radius .",
    "cr barely notice fluctuations on a scale much smaller scale than the larmor radius . on the other hand ,",
    "if the scalelength is much larger than the larmor radius , the cr will see them as a mean field and spiral freely along the total field without scattering .",
    "however a mixture of theoretical ( reville et al 2008 ) and observational studies ( stage et al 2006 , uchiyama et al 2007 ) indicate that the assumption of bohm diffusion is not unreasonable .",
    "according to lagage & cesarsky the maximum cr energy is limited by the ratio of the cycle time @xmath17 to the age of the snr . jokipii ( 1987 )",
    "showed that the cycle time can be much shorter for ` perpendicular shocks ' where the upstream magnetic field is perpendicular to the shock normal . in the intermediate case of an oblique shock with an angle @xmath77 between the magnetic field and the shock",
    "normal a cr must propagate at a projected velocity @xmath78 along a field line if it is to outrun the shock .",
    "consequently , cr are overtaken by the shock in time @xmath79 , the acceleration rate is increased by @xmath80 , and cr reach an energy which is higher by @xmath80 in the same time @xmath48 .",
    "this is still not sufficient to account for acceleration to a pev unless @xmath77 is nearly @xmath81 .",
    "acceleration can be most rapid when the shock is perpendicular ( @xmath82 ) . in this case cr can not outrun the shock by propagating along a field line and cr must diffuse across magnetic field lines to penetrate into the upstream plasma .",
    "this is possible if cr are scattered by fluctuations in the magnetic field . in the standard theory for charged particle diffusion across a magnetic field ,",
    "the cross - field diffusion coefficient is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the larmor frequency , @xmath85 is the scattering ( collision ) time for the cr in the perturbed magnetic field , and @xmath86 is the diffusion coefficient along the magnetic field .",
    "the cr acceleration rate is thereby increased by a factor @xmath87 although acceleration ceases if @xmath88 in which case scattering is not sufficiently strong for cr to penetrate into the upstream plasma by one larmor radius . under optimal conditions and a suitable value of @xmath89 the maximum cr energy as defined by the acceleration time",
    "can be greatly increased ( jokipii 1987 , ellison et al 1995 , meli & biermann 2006 ) .",
    "unfortunately a different constraint intervenes to limit the maximum cr energy at a perpendicular shock .",
    "cr gain energy by drifting along the shock surface under the influence of the magnetic field discontinuity between the upstream magnetic field and the compressed downstream magnetic field .",
    "the source of the energy gain is the ordered @xmath90 electric field necessary for the thermal plasma to cross the magnetic field at velocity @xmath91 in the rest frame of the shock .",
    "the maximum distance the cr can drift on the shock surface is the shock radius @xmath49 yielding a maximum cr energy @xmath92 which is very similar to the maximum cr energy gained at a parallel shock .",
    "if a snr shock expands across a perpendicular magnetic field configured in the form of a parker spiral @xmath92 is the approximate electric potential between the pole and the equator of the snr in the shock frame .",
    "it is possible to construct special cr trajectories in special magnetic field configurations for cr to gain higher energies , but these artificial cases are unlikely to be responsible for the acceleration of cr in large numbers .",
    "although perpendicular shocks may be rapid cr accelerators , cr can not reach pev energies at snr shocks propagating into fields of a few microgauss .",
    "apart from a numerical factor of order unity , the ` hillas parameter ' @xmath92 provides a good estimate of the maximum cr energy where @xmath1 , @xmath40 and @xmath49 are the characteristic velocity , magnetic field and spatial scalelength respectively .",
    "hillas ( 1984 ) surveyed a large range of putative cr acceleration sites with greatly varying values of @xmath40 , @xmath1 and @xmath49 only to find that none of them stand out as the most likely source of high energy cr . at one extreme , @xmath40 and @xmath1",
    "are very large but @xmath49 is very small in pulsar magnetospheres . at the other extreme , @xmath49 and @xmath1",
    "are very large but @xmath40 is very small in the lobes of radio galaxies .    of the three quantities comprising the hillas parameter , @xmath1 and @xmath49",
    "are relatively fixed by shock kinetics and geometry . only @xmath40 is open to radical increase .",
    "it became apparent both observationally and theoretically in the early 2000s that the magnetic field can be amplified at high velocity shocks far beyond the unperturbed upstream value .",
    "vink & laming ( 2003 ) , berezhko et al ( 2003 ) and vlk et al ( 2005 ) showed that amplified magnetic fields were needed to explain the thin strands of x - ray synchrotron emission coincident with the outer shocks of young supernova remnants .",
    "the essence of their analyses was that the thickness of the x - ray strand is determined by synchrotron losses .",
    "the fact that they are thin indicates that the electron synchrotron loss time is short and the magnetic field must be large .",
    "the implied fields are of the order of 100s of microgauss downstream of the shock .",
    "the factor of @xmath93 increase in magnetic field correspondingly increases the hillas parameter by the same factor and may facilitate cr acceleration to a few pev .",
    "coincidentally at the same time that amplified magnetic field was detected observationally in snr , it was shown theoretically that there exists a plasma instability capable of amplifying magnetic field by orders of magnitude ( bell 2004 ) .",
    "it had been recognised from the earliest papers on diffusive shock acceleration that the alfven instability driven by cr streaming ahead of the shock could generate circularly polarised alfven waves with wavelengths in spatial resonance with the cr larmor radius .",
    "the spatially resonant alfven waves strongly scatter the cr thereby reducing the cr mean free path and diffusion coefficient and enabling diffusive shock acceleration . because the instability relies upon a spatial resonance between the wavelength and the cr larmor radius it seemed unlikely that the instability would grow beyond @xmath94 since the resonance would then be destroyed .",
    "the instability might reduce the diffusion coefficient to the bohm value if @xmath94 , but would not increase the hillas parameter and could not explain acceleration to pev energies .",
    "the non - linear evolution of the magnetic field under the influence of cr streaming was investigated numerically by lucek & bell ( 2000 ) .",
    "they coupled a particle simulation of initially streaming cr to a 3d mhd model of the background plasma .",
    "they found that the magnetic field grew by an order of magnitude beyond the initial value before scattering isotropised the streaming cr and removed the force driving instability .",
    "this suggested that cr streaming had the potential to increase the magnetic field and accelerate cr to higher energies .",
    "it was subsequently shown that the dominant instability is in fact not the resonant alfven instability but the previously unrecognised non - resonant hybrid ( nrh ) instability ( bell 2004 ) .",
    "being non - resonant there is less reason for the nrh instability to saturate at @xmath94 . in some configurations , the linear analysis of its growth",
    "is in fact valid for large amplification of the magnetic field ( eg bell 2005 ) .",
    "the nrh instability can be understood by considering cr protons propagating with electric current @xmath95 parallel to a magnetic field @xmath96 in the @xmath97 direction .",
    "add a small magnetic field @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) perpendicular to @xmath96 with components in the @xmath100 plane .",
    "if the wavelength @xmath101 is much smaller than the cr larmor radius , the cr trajectories are undeflected and the current is unperturbed ( @xmath102 ) .",
    "the equation of motion for the background thermal plasma with density @xmath68 moving with velocity @xmath103 in the perpendicular direction is @xmath104 the density @xmath68 is constant since the velocity is perpendicular to the @xmath97 direction .",
    "the @xmath105 force operates through the return current @xmath106 carried by the background plasma to balance the forward cr current .",
    "alternatively the force can be understood as the momentum - conserving reaction against the @xmath107 force acting on the cr .",
    "the magnetic field is frozen into the background plasma and evolves according to the ideal mhd equation @xmath108 equations ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) can be manipulated to give @xmath109 if @xmath98 varies harmonically in the @xmath97 direction parallel to @xmath95 and @xmath96 in proportion to @xmath110 there exist purely growing circularly polarized modes with a growth rate @xmath111 no approximations have been made in this derivation apart from the assumption that the wavelength is much smaller than the cr larmor radius .",
    "the larmor radius of a pev proton in a microgauss magnetic field is 1 parsec so this is an acceptable assumption except that the scalelength of structure in the magnetic field must grow to a larmor radius for effective cr scattering .",
    "apart from the small wavelength assumption , the growth equation is valid for arbitrary non - linearity , ie @xmath112 arbitrarily greater than @xmath113 .",
    "this pure mode continues to grow indefinitely with growth rate @xmath0 .",
    "the same applies in some other special configurations ( bell , 2005 ) . in reality",
    "the perturbed magnetic field more likely consists of a mixture of modes which interfere with each other non - linearly and slow the growth rate , but numerical simulation shows that the magnetic field can still be amplified by orders of magnitude ( bell 2004 ) .",
    "the nrh instability differs from the alfven instability in its polarisation .",
    "both instabilities produce circularly polarised waves of helical magnetic field but the polarisation rotates in opposite directions . in the alfven instability ,",
    "the magnetic field rotates in the same sense as the spiral cr trajectories to maintain a resonance between the magnetic field @xmath114 and the streaming cr .",
    "in contrast , the nrh polarisation and the cr trajectories are counter - rotating and non - resonant .",
    "this surprising feature may explain why the nrh instability remained unrecognised for many years .",
    "as shown by the graph of magnetic energy density against time in figure 1 , the nrh instability can grow non - linearly to amplify the magnetic field by a large factor .",
    "the instability continues to grow provided two conditions are satisfied .",
    "firstly , the instability grows only if its characteristic scalelength @xmath115 does not exceed the cr larmor radius , otherwise cr spiral along the perturbed magnetic field lines and the @xmath116 force averages to zero .",
    "secondly , the @xmath116 force driving the instability must exceed the magnetic tension @xmath117 which opposes the expansion in the amplitude of spirals in the magnetic field . to order of magnitude , these two conditions are respectively @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "eliminating @xmath115 between the conditions gives @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the energy flux carried by the cr in the rest frame of the background plasma .",
    "if @xmath122 , either the scalength @xmath115 must be larger than the cr larmor radius , or @xmath115 must be so short that the magnetic tension overpowers the @xmath116 force .",
    "note that the resonant alfven instability is not restricted in the same way by magnetic tension since the instability excites alfven waves which are natural plasma modes and propagate without damping provided damping by collisions or wave - wave interactions can be neglected .",
    "the nrh instability condition @xmath120 can be related to the cr energy density @xmath123 .",
    "the upstream cr distribution is nearly at rest in the shock frame , so @xmath124 in the upstream frame .",
    "if @xmath125 where @xmath126 is an efficiency factor then the magnetic energy density is limited to @xmath127 .    we must be careful about the meaning we attach to the cr energy density @xmath123 , the efficiency @xmath126 and the magnetic energy density @xmath128 .",
    "the cr energy spectrum at a snr shock extends by six orders of magnitude from gev to pev .",
    "a gev proton has a larmor radius @xmath35 times smaller than that of a pev proton , the scaleheight of its precursor ahead of the shock is correspondingly @xmath35 times smaller , and it drives and responds to magnetic perturbations which are similarly @xmath35 times smaller .",
    "hence the system of gev cr and their accompanying magnetic fluctuations can be expected to decouple from that of pev cr and their associated magnetic fluctuations . as a consequence",
    ", the discussion of @xmath123 , @xmath126 and @xmath128 in the previous paragraph refers to a particular energy range of cr .",
    "since cr energy densities are spread nearly equally between gev and pev , only a fraction @xmath129 of the total cr energy density contributes to magnetic field amplification on a specified scale . if @xmath130 of @xmath131 is given to cr in total , then @xmath125 where @xmath132 .",
    "bell ( 2004 ) and bell et al ( 2013 ) give more detailed discussions of @xmath126 .",
    "see also zirakshvili & ptuskin ( 2008 ) , although their parameter @xmath133 differs in definition by a numerical factor from our @xmath126 .",
    "the magnetic energy density associated with a particle energy range of cr is then @xmath134 with @xmath135 .",
    "this provides an estimate of a magnetic field @xmath136 available to scatter cr in a particular energy range .",
    "the magnetic field is amplified on a range of scales corresponding to the larmor radii of cr with energies ranging from gev to pev , in which case the total magnetic energy density immediately upstream of the shock is better estimated by setting @xmath137 giving @xmath138 .",
    "the field is compressed by a further factor of about 3 when it passes through the shock to give a good match to the magnetic field inferred from the observed x - ray synchrotron emission at snr shocks .",
    "for the nrh instability to explain cr acceleration to pev it must not only amplify the magnetic field sufficiently but also produce magnetic structures on the scale of the cr larmor radius .",
    "the growth rate is proportional to @xmath139 so small scale structure grows most rapidly .",
    "fortunately , magnetic field amplification and increase in spatial scalelength are connected aspects of the non - linear nrh instability since the field grows by the stretching of field lines . in its simplest configurations the magnetic field",
    "is amplified by an increase in the radius of loops of magnetic field or in the radius of a helical field - line .",
    "equation ( 3 ) for a harmonic mode with wavenumber @xmath140 can be integrated to show that the radius of spirals in the magnetic field is @xmath141 , which indicates that the scalelength grows nonlinearly in proportion to the magnetic field .",
    "nonlinear numerical simulations presented in the grey - scale plots of figure 1 ( see also reville et al 2008 , zirakashvili , ptuskin & vlk 2008 , riquelme & spitkovsky 2009 , 2010 , and reville & bell 2013 ) clearly demonstrate strong growth in scale .",
    "the instability evolves nonlinearly into a series of expanding cells consisting of walls of high plasma density and strong magnetic field spiralling around cavities of low density and low magnetic field .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the instability grows over a range of wavenumbers bounded by @xmath142 at long wavelength and @xmath143 at short wavelength .",
    "saturation occurs when these two wavenumbers coincide with both @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "consequently @xmath146 at saturation and the dominant scalelength at saturation is equal to the cr larmor radius as required for effective cr scattering .",
    "as shown above the nrh instability has the capacity to amplify the magnetic field by orders of magnitude .",
    "we now investigate the conditions necessary for the instability to grow through many e - foldings in the available time .",
    "the nrh growth time is @xmath147 where @xmath148 is the energy of cr protons in pev and @xmath149 is @xmath126 relative to 0.03 ( @xmath150 if @xmath151 ) .",
    "equation ( 6 ) shows that the nrh instability does not have time to grow on the scale of the larmor radius ( @xmath152 ) of a pev proton in young snr .",
    "fortunately , the growth rate is proportional to @xmath139 so there is time for the instability to grow initially on a small scale ( @xmath153 ) and subsequently expand non - linearly to match the cr larmor radius .",
    "the smallest scalelength on which the instability can grow is set by the tension in the magnetic field . as discussed above",
    ", the @xmath116 must dominate the magnetic force @xmath154 and this condition is satisfied if @xmath155 .",
    "the growth rate is at a maximum @xmath156 when the wavenumber is @xmath157 ( bell 2004 ) .",
    "the corresponding fastest growth time and associated scalelength are @xmath158 @xmath159 giving @xmath160 the growth time @xmath161 of the fastest growing mode is sufficiently short to allow many e - foldings during the lifetime of a snr .",
    "the initial scalelength @xmath162 is much smaller than the cr larmor radius but @xmath162 increases in proportion to the growing magnetic field .",
    "@xmath163 @xmath164 , so an increase in magnetic field from a few @xmath165 to @xmath166 increases @xmath163 to @xmath167 as required for effective cr scattering .",
    "as seen in the grey - scale plots in figure 1 magnetic field structures grow substantially in a few growth times .",
    "the graph of magnetic energy density in figure 1 shows that the magnetic field grows substantially in the same time . in this section",
    "we take @xmath168 to be the characteristic time for magnetic field amplification as observed in young snr .",
    "as shown in section 8 of bell et al ( 2013 ) @xmath63 for a spherical freely expanding blast wave can be calculated by equating @xmath169 to @xmath170 .",
    "equation ( 7 ) can be inverted to derive an equation for the maximum cr energy : @xmath171 an equivalent result was first derived by zirakashvili & ptuskin ( 2008 ) using a more sophisticated model for cr transport and acceleration .",
    "the physics underlying their calculation of the maximum cr energy is the same in essence .    equation ( 10 ) for the maximum cr energy is governed by the nrh growth rate .",
    "if cr were accelerated to a higher energy , the upstream cr electric current driving the instability would be reduced for the same cr energy flux @xmath172 since fewer cr would be needed to carry the cr energy .",
    "conversely , if cr were accelerated only to a lower energy the cr electric current would be increased , the growth rate would increase , and the magnetic field would be amplified sufficiently to accelerate cr to the higher energy .",
    "hence the cr current and the nrh growth are self - regulated to drive the instability through about five e - foldings ( @xmath173 ) in the time available .",
    "note that the magnitude of the magnetic field does not appear in this derivation of @xmath63 .",
    "it immediately stands out that @xmath63 in equation ( 10 ) falls short of the energy of the knee for parameters appropriate to young snr .",
    "our derivation of @xmath63 is approximate , for example in the estimation that @xmath174 . from figure 1",
    "it appears that if anything a time greater than @xmath175 should be allowed for magnetic field amplification , in which case @xmath63 would be lower and acceleration to pev less likely . on the other hand ,",
    "there are ways in which the value for @xmath63 given in equation ( 10 ) might be an underestimate . for example",
    ", our derivation treats cr as mono - energetic .",
    "lower energy cr may be leaking upstream from the shock to add to the electric current driving magnetic field amplification .",
    "equation ( 10 ) gives @xmath176tev for the historical snr since their velocities are @xmath177 or less , which is a full factor of ten lower than the cr energy at the knee .",
    "the cr energies reached in the historical snr and the implications for galactic cr origins are discussed below in section 14 .",
    "here we emphasise that cr acceleration only occurs if cr accelerated to the highest energy escape upstream of the shock in contrast to cr accelerated to lower energies which are advected away downstream of the shock .",
    "consider a point ahead of the approaching shock .",
    "cr streaming away from the shock pass freely through this point until the instability has grown sufficiently to scatter cr and confine them to the shock precursor . in accord with the discussion above",
    ", this occurs when @xmath178 where @xmath179 .",
    "consequently , confinement sets in when the time integral of cr charge per unit area passing through this point reaches @xmath180 the condition for confinement is that a charge @xmath181 per unit area of shock must escape freely upstream before cr following after it can be confined .",
    "hence cr escape upstream is an essential feature of cr acceleration by shocks .",
    "the nrh instability operates ( i ) only on scales comparable or smaller than the larmor radius of the cr with energy @xmath42 ( in ev ) driving the instability ( ie @xmath182 ) , and ( ii ) only if the @xmath116 force driving magnetic field amplification is stronger than the magnetic force @xmath183 ( ie @xmath184 ) .",
    "consequently there is no range of wavelengths at which the nrh instability is active if @xmath185 , ( ie @xmath186 ) .",
    "since the cr energy flux is @xmath187 , the condition for magnetic field amplification by the nrh instability is @xmath188 , which is equivalent to @xmath189 this limit implies that the nrh instability is active in the historical snr which are expanding at @xmath190 , but that it is unavailable for magnetic field amplification during much of the sedov phase .",
    "when the expansion drops below about @xmath191 the @xmath116 force is too weak to overcome the magnetic force @xmath183 for magnetic fields of a few @xmath192 . this condition ( equation 12 ) is equivalent to requiring that the saturation magnetic field derived in section 6 must be greater than the initial magnetic field in the ambient medium . it does not apply to the alfven instability where the magnetic force is part of the natural oscillation of the alfven waves excited by the instability as mentioned in section 6 .",
    "as shown above , the nrh instability at the outer shocks of snr is only excited in the early stages of evolution when the expansion velocity is comparable with or greater than @xmath193 for an ambient magnetic field of a few @xmath194 . below this velocity ,",
    "the resonant alfven instability is dominant .    from equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) in bell ( 2004 ) the dispersion relation including both the nrh and alfven instabilities for a mono - energetic cr distribution drifting diffusively at the shock velocity @xmath1 is @xmath195 @xmath196 \\right \\",
    "}   \\eqno{(13)}\\ ] ] where @xmath197 is the cr larmor radius and the imaginary term on the right hand side is cancelled when @xmath198 by the imaginary part of the logarithmic term .",
    "the combination of the quantities @xmath199 shows the importance of the relative directions of cr current , the magnetic field and the polarisation of the wave . changing the sign of @xmath200",
    "while keeping @xmath140 and @xmath40 unchanged causes an unstable wave to become stable and vice versa under most circumstances .",
    "see bell ( 2004 ) for more detail .    in the limit of large @xmath200 appropriate to young snr",
    "the nrh instability grows most strongly at wavelengths shorter than the cr larmor radius ( @xmath201 ) where the dispersion relation reduces to @xmath202 and the term @xmath203 sets the short wavelength limit beyond which the magnetic tension is stabilising .    in the limit of small @xmath200 ( @xmath204 ) appropriate to old snr and growth of the alfven instability the dispersion relation reduces to @xmath205",
    "the maximum instability growth rate of the alfven instability is @xmath206 which occurs when the wavelength of the alfven wave is @xmath207 ( @xmath208 ) .",
    "the growth of the alfven instability is governed by the imaginary term @xmath209 in the square brackets in equation ( 13 ) in contrast to the growth of the nrh which is determined by the first term since fastest nrh growth occurs when @xmath210 .",
    "the alfven instability is driven by @xmath211 where @xmath212 is the perturbed cr current and @xmath96 is the unperturbed magnetic field , whereas the nrh instability is driven by @xmath213 .",
    "the two instabilities also differ in their polarisation and dominant wavenumber : @xmath214 for the alfven instability compared with @xmath215 for the fastest growing nrh wavelength .",
    "both instabilities have nearly the same maximum growth rate , but each dominates under different conditions . the crossover from the alfven to the nrh instability",
    "occurs when the cr current @xmath200 becomes large enough for @xmath216 to exceed @xmath217 on the larmor scale ( @xmath146 ) at which point the @xmath218 force overpowers the tension in the magnetic field on the scale of a cr larmor radius .",
    "the similar values of the alfven and nrh maximum growth rates , as pointed out by zirakashvili & ptuskin ( 2008 ) , allows the analysis of section 9 to be applied at low shock velocities relevant to older snr as well as to high velocity young snr shocks at which the nrh instability is active .",
    "equation ( 10 ) is therefore applicable to both young snr and snr throughout the sedov phase",
    ".    equation ( 10 ) finally becomes inapplicable when the shock velocity drops to a few times the alfven speed , @xmath219 since the alfven instability is driven by the drift of cr relative to the motion of the the driven resonant alfven wave .",
    "however , the shock may have dissipated by that time if the shock velocity has dropped below the ion acoustic sound speed , @xmath220 .",
    "since the maximum growth rates of both the nrh and the alfven instabilities are the same to within a numerical factor close to one , equation ( 10 ) for the energy @xmath63 of escaping cr can be applied throughout the lifetime of a snr . by definition of @xmath126 , the energy flux of cr escaping with energy @xmath63 is @xmath172 and the total energy spectrum of cr injected into the galaxy by a snr can be derived .",
    "the number @xmath221 of cr escaping with energy greater than @xmath42 is the number of cr escaping before the snr radius expands to a radius r at which @xmath222 .",
    "@xmath223 the corresponding differential energy spectrum @xmath224 is @xmath225 from equation ( 10 ) , @xmath226 for a uniform ambient density . in the self - similar sedov phase @xmath227 , so the spectrum of cr escaping into the interstellar medium in the sedov phase is @xmath228 which is the same as the spectrum for test particle cr accelerated at a strong shock .",
    "this is not surprising since the same @xmath6 spectrum of escaping cr can arise under a range of self - similar assumptions regarding cr escape during the sedov phase ( caprioli et al ( 2010 ) , drury ( 2011 ) , ohira et al ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "it is sufficient ( from equation 18 ) that the dependence of the cr escape energy on shock radius should be a power law and that the efficiency @xmath126 should be constant .",
    "the energy of a sedov blast wave of radius @xmath49 expanding into a medium with @xmath229 and density @xmath68 at velocity @xmath1 is approximately @xmath230 with the consequence from equation ( 10 ) that the energy of cr escaping at a particular stage of a sedov expansion is @xmath231 where the expansion velocity is given in terms of the alfven mach number @xmath232 of the shock , @xmath233 is the blast wave energy in @xmath71 and @xmath52 is the ambient magnetic field in @xmath194 .",
    "the shock dissipates into the interstellar medium as @xmath234 at which time cr are no longer confined to the remnant since the magnetic fluctations that scatter them move at the alfven speed . assuming that cr acceleration weakens when @xmath235 at a shock propagating into a field of @xmath236 , the energy spectrum of escaping cr terminates at a lower energy of @xmath237 . at this point",
    "cr previously confined to the interior of the snr are released into the interstellar medium .",
    "galactic cr accelerated by snr can be divided into two populations , ( i ) cr above @xmath237 that escape upstream during snr expansion ( ii ) cr at energies below @xmath238 , but also extending into the tev range , that are advected into the interior of the snr and released into the ism at the end of snr expansion when the shock dissipates .    for the different reasons explained above",
    ", both populations have the same energy spectrum @xmath239 at source , although in reality additional factors might be expected to slightly steepen or flatten each spectrum , and propagation losses steepen the entire spectrum to the approximately @xmath240 power law arriving at the earth .",
    "it is unlikely that the spectra of the two populations should join smoothly at @xmath238 without at least a slight bend in the spectrum or some noticeable feature .",
    "the most obvious candidate for a spectral signature of a join in the spectrum is that seen by pamela at about 200gev ( adriani et al 2011 ) .",
    "the observational status of the detailed spectral feature is uncertain in the light of recent ams observations ( ting 2013 ) , but a change in spectral index near this energy is supported by other measurements ( ahn et al 2010 ) .",
    "also our theoretical estimate of 200gev as the exact value of @xmath238 is subject to considerable uncertainty , and energy - dependent cr propagation might be an alternative explanation for a change in spectral index ( blasi et al 2012 , tomassetti 2012 ) .",
    "the total energy in escaping cr can be derived from the current @xmath241 of escaping cr as discussed above ( equations 17 & 18 ) .",
    "only the highest energy cr being accelerated escape at any one time .",
    "they carry only @xmath242 of the energy content of the cr carried into the interior of the snr .",
    "cr carried into the interior cool adiabatically as the snr expands .",
    "their energy is recouped as their pressure drives the shock and accelerates later generations of cr .",
    "integration over the whole lifetime of the snr shows overall that the acceleration and release of cr into the interstellar medium can be a highly efficient process ( bell et al 2013 ) .",
    "the expression , @xmath243 , derived in section 9 , equation ( 10 ) , for the maximum cr energy can be applied to the historical snr usually regarded as the most likely source of pev cr in the galaxy .",
    "similar results are obtained by zirakashvili & ptuskin ( 2008 ) .",
    "the controlling parameters , @xmath72 , @xmath54 and @xmath53 , are often uncertain , particularly the ambient density @xmath72 , but also the radius @xmath53 since the distance to the snr is not always well determined .",
    "the predicted maximum cr energies in tev are cas a : 160 ( @xmath244 , @xmath245 & @xmath61 ) sn1006 : 100 ( @xmath246 , @xmath247 & @xmath248 ) tycho : 100 ( @xmath249 , @xmath250 & @xmath61 ) kepler : 70 ( @xmath251 , @xmath245 & @xmath252 ) ( raymond et al 2007 , vink 2008 , williams et al 2013 ) .",
    "the maximum cr energy is low in each case because the expansion is already heavily decelerated .",
    "if we replace the current expansion velocity with the mean expansion velocity @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the age in hundreds of years , such that equation ( 10 ) becomes @xmath255 , then the estimated maximum cr energies are larger : cas a : 240 ( @xmath244 , @xmath245 & @xmath256 ) sn1006 : 900 ( @xmath246 , @xmath247 & @xmath257 ) tycho : 540 ( @xmath258 , @xmath250 & @xmath259 ) kepler : 120 ( @xmath251 , @xmath245 & @xmath260 ) the mean expansion velocity predicts a higher cr energy in each case , approaching 1pev for sn1006 because of its high average expansion velocity .",
    "however , the predicted cr energy depends on the third power of the radius and hence distance to the snr .",
    "the derived distances to tycho and kepler vary by a factor of two between the largest and the smallest , so the uncertainties are very large in the above cr energies .",
    "moreover equation ( 10 ) might easily be in error by a factor of 2 or 3 because of the assumptions entering its derivation as discussed in section 9 .",
    "most of the assumptions made in the derivation of equation ( 10 ) were generous in terms of trying to make @xmath63 larger rather than smaller so as to reach the knee .",
    "for example it is easy to see how the efficiency parameter @xmath126 might be smaller than @xmath261 but not much larger than this ( but see schure & bell 2013b ) . nevertheless , the cr energies predicted for present expansion velocities fall substantially short of the energy of the knee , so it appears likely that none of the historical snr are at present accelerating cr to the knee .",
    "the dependence of @xmath63 on the square of the shock velocity implies that the highest cr energies are more probably reached in young high velocity snr .",
    "the youngest known galactic snr , g1.9 + 0.3 aged 110 years , is expanding at @xmath262 with a radius of 2.2pc ( borkowski et al 2013 ) .",
    "reynolds et al ( 2008 ) give an ambient density of @xmath263 predicting a maximum cr energy @xmath264 from equation ( 10 ) .",
    "if the snr were expanding at the same velocity into a higher density circumstellar medium , @xmath265 for example , it could be accelerating cr to the knee .",
    "however uncertain the above estimates for @xmath63 , the strong dependence on expansion velocity points to the ideal pev accelerator as a very young snr expanding at high velocity into a dense wind environment as previously suggested by vlk & biermann ( 1988 ) and bell & lucek ( 2001 ) .",
    "ptuskin et al ( 2010 ) survey different types of supernovae and find that type iib sn may accelerate cr to a particularly high energy , and may accelerate iron to @xmath266 .",
    "sn1987a may be a relatively nearby and well - diagnosed example of a high energy accelerator .",
    "constant expansion for time @xmath267 in years at its initial expansion velocity of @xmath268 predicts @xmath269 .",
    "expansion into a high density circumstellar medium over a decade or more should accelerate cr to the knee quite easily , and possibly to higher energies .",
    "sn1987a has passed through a number of different phases since it exploded into a highly structured medium including rings of radius 0.2pc and with a range of densities @xmath270 ( mattila et al 2010 ) .",
    "the ejecta velocity slowed to @xmath271 on encountering the dense ring ( larsson et al 2011 ) .",
    "substituting @xmath272 , @xmath273 & @xmath274 in equation ( 10 ) predicts an estimated maximum cr energy at that stage of @xmath275 .",
    "the ring has a mass of @xmath276 solar masses ( mattila et al 2010 ) , so the energy processed through the shock during the encounter with the ring is @xmath277 which would contribute substantially to the galactic cr energy budget if a similar snr occurred in the galaxy .",
    "it appears that very young snr are the most likely sites for acceleration to the knee .",
    "schure & bell ( 2013a ) have analysed the evolution of the cr spectrum in the pre - sedov phase for snr expanding into a pre - ejected circumstellar wind .",
    "they find that cas a probably accelerated cr to pev energies at an earlier stage of its expansion .",
    "if acceleration to the knee only happens where snr expand into a dense wind then the cr composition can be expected to be heavier at energies approaching the knee .",
    "this would be consistent with the observation that the galactic helium spectrum is flatter than the proton spectrum and that helium nuclei are more numerous than protons at the knee ( kampert 2007 ) .",
    "cosmic ray physics is now solidly part of mainstream astrophysics , particularly as a result of x - ray and @xmath278-ray observations of in situ cr acceleration .",
    "theoretical models of galactic cr acceleration to pev energies can be constructed with the tentative conclusion that cr are accelerated to the knee in very young snr and that probably none of the known galactic snr are able to accelerate protons beyond a pev at the present time .",
    "measurements of cr composition and precise determinations of the detailed energy spectra of different species increasingly provide powerful tests of theory .",
    "observations with the cta cherenkov telescope ( hinton & hofmann 2009 , aharonian 2013 ) should decisively indicate whether our current models are on the right lines .",
