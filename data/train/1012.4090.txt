    "in the basic su(2 ) skyrme model , the solution with the lowest energy - per - charge @xmath0 is the triply - periodic skyrme crystal @xcite . for a given value of the topological charge ( winding number , or baryon number ) @xmath1 , there are in general many isolated @xmath1-skyrmion solutions ,",
    "_ i.e. _  local minima of the energy ; but the belief is that for @xmath2 , the lowest - energy solution will resemble a chunk of the skyrme crystal .",
    "however , in the skyrme - faddeev system , where the field takes values in @xmath3 and the topological charge @xmath1 is the hopf number , the situation is less clear .",
    "if there were a triply - periodic crystalline solution with @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is a constant independent of @xmath1 ) , as in the skyrme case , then a large crystalline chunk would have @xmath6 .",
    "but we know @xcite that there exist solutions with @xmath7 , so such a crystal chunk certainly could not be the global energy minimum among fields of charge @xmath1 , although it could be a local minimum . in general , it seems to be the case that hopf solitons tend to clump into a tangle ; various examples , for low values of @xmath1 , may be seen in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this letter is to explore this difference in behaviour , by investigating triply - periodic crystalline solutions in a system which interpolates between the two cases above .",
    "this generalized skyrme system was introduced in @xcite ; it is labelled by a parameter @xmath8 $ ] , in such a way that @xmath9 gives the ` pure ' skyrme model , whereas @xmath10 gives the skyrme - faddeev model . in particular",
    ", we wish to see what happens to the skyrme crystal as the system deforms away from the basic skyrme case .",
    "the interpolating system is very natural geometrically . for simplicity ,",
    "let us restrict to static fields in all of what follows .",
    "let @xmath11 be a compact 3-dimensional , oriented , connected riemannian manifold .",
    "then for fields @xmath12 , the skyrme energy functional @xmath13 $ ] has a natural definition , depending in particular on the metric of @xmath11 @xcite . with the usual boundary condition @xmath14 as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is some specified point on @xmath11 , the topological charge @xmath1 is defined to be the degree of the map @xmath17 .",
    "our system is obtained by taking @xmath11 to be the squashed 3-sphere ( berger sphere ) : the standard 3-sphere squashed along its hopf fibres by a factor @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath9 , there is no squashing : the target space is just the round sphere su(2 ) , and we have the skyrme model . in the degenerate case @xmath10 , the 3-sphere becomes a 2-sphere , the winding number @xmath1 becomes the hopf number , and we have the skyrme - faddeev model .",
    "the system has a potential condensed - matter interpretation in which the two complex fields @xmath19 represent two flavours of cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 then appears as the coefficient of a term @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the current density . in particular",
    ", arrays might be of interest in this context .",
    "in this section , we give some details of the one - parameter interpolating family of skyrme systems .",
    "the field is denoted @xmath23 , where each component @xmath24 is a function of the spatial coordinates @xmath25 , and the constraint @xmath26 is imposed .",
    "the energy density for the system , parametrized by @xmath8 $ ] , is @xmath27    + \\lambda_4[2(1-\\alpha)f^j_{\\beta\\gamma}f^j_{\\beta\\gamma}+\\alpha q^jq^j],\\ ] ] where @xmath28 with @xmath29 being a symplectic form with non - zero components @xmath30 . the coupling constants @xmath31 and",
    "@xmath32 can be scaled as desired , by changing the units of energy and length ; in what follows , we shall use the ` geometrical ' choice @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] as in @xcite .",
    "the effect of this is that the energy of a 1-skyrmion on @xmath35 is approximately independent of @xmath20 ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "if we are thinking of the skyrme model as a nonlinear theory of pions , then the deformation when @xmath20 becomes positive may be viewed as putting one of the three pions on a different footing from the other two . to see this explicitly ,",
    "we impose the boundary condition @xmath37 as @xmath15 , and identify @xmath38 as the pion fields in the usual way . then in the asymptotic region the energy density ( [ enden ] ) becomes @xmath39.\\ ] ] if @xmath10 , then one of the fields becomes non - dynamic .",
    "this amounts to passing from the original target space @xmath40 to the quotient space @xmath41 , by the hopf projection @xmath42 the relevant field is then the unit 3-vector @xmath43 , and the energy density ( [ enden ] ) becomes @xmath44,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "this is the skyrme - faddeev energy @xcite",
    ".    the energy @xmath13 $ ] is the integral of ( [ enden ] ) over @xmath35 , or over a fundamental cell if one is dealing with periodic fields .",
    "there is a bogomolny - type lower bound @xcite on the energy of fields with topological charge @xmath1 , namely @xmath46 .",
    "using the fact that the volume of the squashed 3-sphere is @xmath47 , and with our choice of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , this gives @xmath48 in the limit @xmath10 , the bound ( [ bog ] ) becomes trivial .",
    "there are various nontrivial bounds in this case . for isolated hopf solitons on @xmath35 ,",
    "we know that @xmath49 , where @xmath5 is a constant ; it is conjectured that this bound holds for @xmath50 @xcite . this bound is not valid for triply - periodic fields @xmath51 ; but in that case there is another lower bound , which follows from the general formula given in @xcite : if @xmath17 is triply - periodic , and @xmath52 is the largest of its periods , then its normalized energy satisfies @xmath53 .    for @xmath9 , the expression ( [ enden ] ) gives the standard static skyrme energy , and it has an obvious o(4 ) symmetry . for @xmath54 ,",
    "the symmetry is broken to u(2 ) , this being the subgroup of o(4 ) which preserves the symplectic form @xmath55 .    in this letter",
    ", we are focusing on crystalline configurations , so the fields are periodic in @xmath56 with periods @xmath57 respectively . in effect",
    ", @xmath17 is a map from @xmath58 to @xmath59 , and it is classified topologically by its degree @xmath60 .",
    "the topological classification of maps from @xmath58 to @xmath3 , which is relevant to the @xmath10 case , is more complicated .",
    "but if we restrict to fields which are algebraically inessential , meaning that the 2-form @xmath61 belongs to the trivial cohomology class in @xmath62 , then the classification remains a single integer @xmath60 ( _ cf .",
    "_  @xcite ) .",
    "the hopf charge of the hopf projection @xmath43 of @xmath17 is equal to the degree of @xmath17 , so it is consistent to let @xmath1 denote either .",
    "in this section , we investigate various triply - periodic solutions in the family of generalized skyrme systems para- metrized by @xmath20 .",
    "there are many of these , corresponding to different local minima of the energy , and we shall describe only some of them .    the results that follow are obtained by numerical minimization of the energy functional @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "more specifically , the expression for the energy is replaced by a second - order finite - difference approximation on a rectangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions , and the minima are found by conjugate - gradient relaxation .",
    "testing with various different values of the lattice spacing indicates that the accuracy , for example in the energy @xmath63 , is better than @xmath64 .",
    "as remarked above , there are many local minima , and the initial configuration determines which one of these is obtained after flowing down the energy gradient .",
    "we also vary the side - lengths @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 of the fundamental cell , so as to get the lowest possible value of @xmath13 $ ] .    in the original skyrme system ( @xmath9 ) , the lowest - energy crystal is a cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "its unit cell contains eight half - skyrmions , and has @xmath68 .",
    "we begin by taking this as the initial configuration , and minimizing @xmath13 $ ] for various values of @xmath20 .    in the @xmath9 case",
    ", the minimum occurs at @xmath69 ; but the side - lengths cease to be all equal when @xmath70 .",
    "this occurs because the system has less symmetry than when @xmath9 ; in particular , one of the spatial directions , which we take to be the @xmath71-direction , is now on a different footing from the other two . for @xmath70 , the half - skyrmions become elongated in the @xmath71-direction , and the optimal side - lengths satisfy @xmath72 .",
    "these aspects are illustrated in figure  1 .",
    "the upper - left plot shows the optimal ( minimal - energy ) values of @xmath73 and @xmath67 , as functions of @xmath20 , in the range @xmath74 .    , and @xmath67 ; and the energy density for @xmath75.[fig1 ] ]",
    "we see that in the skyrme case @xmath9 , we have @xmath69 , as noted above ; but as @xmath20 increases , the lattice cells are compressed in the @xmath71-direction and expanded in the @xmath76- and @xmath77-directions .",
    "the behaviour in the @xmath10 limit will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the other three pictures in figure  1 plot the energy density @xmath78 , or more precisely the surfaces where @xmath78 equals 0.7 times its maximum value , for three values of @xmath20 ranging from 0.3 to 0.9 .",
    "we see that as @xmath20 increases , the half - skyrmions join up pairwise in the @xmath71-direction , to form four parallel vortices ; these are in fact two vortices and two antivortices , and so this field is called the v+av+v+av solution . in the @xmath79 limit ,",
    "the vortices become homogeneous in the @xmath71-direction ; such vortices will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "the symmetries of the @xmath70 fields depicted in figure  1 are a subset of the @xmath9 skyrme - crystal symmetries @xcite , and are generated by @xmath80 @xmath81 @xmath82    the normalized energy of these solutions is plotted in figure  2 , as a function of @xmath20 .     of crystalline solutions , versus @xmath20 .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    the other plots in figure  2 are the bogomolny bound ( [ bog ] ) , and the energies of two other triply - periodic solutions which will be described below .    at this point , let us say more about @xmath71-homogeneous vortices . the field of a @xmath83-vortex with unit @xmath71-twist , located on the @xmath71-axis , can be put in the form @xmath84 near that axis . if @xmath85 , we refer to it as a @xmath83-vortex , whereas if @xmath86 we refer to it as a @xmath83-antivortex .",
    "if we restrict the hopf projection @xmath87 of @xmath17 to the plane @xmath88 , we get a map from @xmath89 to @xmath3 ; the degree of this map is the total vortex number in the @xmath71-direction ( taking the multiplicity @xmath83 of each vortex into account ) .",
    "this total vortex number has to be zero , since it is the degree of a hopf projection .",
    "in other words , there have to be an equal number of vortices and antivortices .",
    "the topological charge @xmath1 is the sum of the absolute values of the vortex numbers ; in other words , vortices and antivortices both contribute positively to @xmath1 . the @xmath90 field illustrated in figure  1 is close to an @xmath68 multi - vortex configuration , with two 1-vortices and two 1-antivortices , and hence is referred to as v+av+v+av .",
    "it is worth noting that analogous v+av+v+av configurations can appear in the @xmath9 case , for values of the side - lengths @xmath91 which differ from the optimal ones @xcite .",
    "skyrme vortices , or more precisely vortex - antivortex pairs , were discussed in @xcite . in particular , it was shown there that if one has a parallel vortex - antivortex pair separated by a ( large ) distance @xmath92 , then there is an attractive force between them , the leading term of which is proportional to @xmath93 . in our @xmath20-family , the expression for the attractive force is the same , except that it acquires a factor of @xmath18 . in other words , vortices and antivortices attract one another , as long as @xmath94 . in the @xmath79 limit , however , the leading - order term vanishes .",
    "it is not known whether there is still an attractive vortex - antivortex force in this limit , but numerical experiments suggest that the force becomes repulsive . in particular , the two vortices and two antivortices in our picture repel each other when @xmath10 , and therefore @xmath95 as @xmath79 , consistent with the upper - left plot in figure  1 .",
    "the second vortex - type solution featuring in figure  2 is 2v+2av , and it consists of a 2-vortex and a parallel 2-antivortex . its energy is plotted for @xmath96 , and it is apparent that in this range , its energy is less than that of v+av+v+av . in this case",
    ", the numerical evidence again suggests that @xmath95 as @xmath79 , implying that the 2-vortex and the 2-antivortex repel each other in that limit .",
    "the four pictures in figure  3 plot the energy density isosurfaces where @xmath78 equals 0.8 times its maximum value , for four values of @xmath20 ranging from 0.6 to 0.99 .",
    ".[fig3 ] ]    note that in the @xmath10 ( skyrme - faddeev ) system , we can have vortices without antivortex partners  the restriction of the net vortex number being zero does not apply in this case .",
    "such hopf - vortex fields have been the subject of several studies , such as @xcite .",
    "the results described above suggest that in the skyrme - faddeev system , the normalized energy of a @xmath83-vortex decreases as @xmath83 increases .",
    "this indeed turns out to be the case , as we now explain in more detail .",
    "consider fields @xmath43 with energy density ( [ enden_hopf ] ) on @xmath97 .",
    "so @xmath43 is periodic in @xmath71 with period @xmath52 , and it satisfies the boundary condition @xmath98 as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 .",
    "more specifically , consider rotationally - symmetric @xmath83-vortices centred on the @xmath71-axis : these will have the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 satisfies @xmath103 and @xmath104 as @xmath99 . finding",
    "the minimal energy @xmath105 for various values of the vortex number @xmath83 is a straightforward numerical computation , and this was done for @xmath106 .",
    "let us , as usual , normalize the energy @xmath105 by dividing it by the topological charge @xmath83 .",
    "the result is that @xmath105 depends linearly on @xmath107 : @xmath108 and it is this value ( with , respectively , @xmath109 and @xmath110 ) which is used for the @xmath10 ends of the v+av+v+av and 2v+2av plots in figure  2 .    in view of the above",
    ", it seems likely that triply - periodic solutions with even lower values of @xmath0 than v+av+v+av and 2v+2av could be constructed by assembling parallel arrays of @xmath83-vortices and @xmath83-antivortices for @xmath111 ; but this has not been investigated further .    the solutions corresponding to the final plot in figure  2 , referred to as `` multi - sheet '' , have a lower value of energy - per - charge than the others mentioned previously if @xmath112 , and do not resemble parallel vortex - antivortex configurations for @xmath20 close to 1 .",
    "figure  4 shows the energy density isosurfaces where @xmath78 equals 0.8 times its maximum value , for four values of @xmath20 ranging from 0.6 to 0.99 .",
    ".[fig4 ] ]    as @xmath20 approaches 1 , they are closely approximated by fields which are homogeneous in @xmath76 and @xmath77 , in fact of the form @xmath113 where @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath116 .",
    "their energy density depends only on @xmath71 , and is peaked on sheets orthogonal to the @xmath71-axis .",
    "such fields arise if we impose the symmetries generated by @xmath117 @xmath118 @xmath119 note that such transformations on @xmath19 preserve the energy ( [ enden ] ) . in other words , translations in @xmath76 or @xmath77 , and an inversion , can be compensated by a symmetry transformation of the field .    in order to have periodicity in @xmath71 , and for the topological charge @xmath1 to be nonzero",
    ", we need to arrange things rather carefully .",
    "a periodic field with @xmath68 is obtained by imposing @xmath120 for @xmath121 , and @xmath122 note that the resulting field is continuous .",
    "substituting ( [ newcrys1 ] , [ newcrys2 ] ) into the formula ( [ enden ] ) for the energy density gives an expression of the form @xmath123 , where @xmath124 .",
    "then a standard bogomolny argument implies that , for given values of @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( and @xmath20 ) , the normalized energy @xmath63 attains a minimum value @xmath125 when @xmath67 is given by @xmath126 the next step is to minimize ( [ emin ] ) with respect to @xmath65 and @xmath66 , which was done using numerical integration .",
    "the resulting minimal energy for the ansatz ( [ newcrys1 ] , [ newcrys2 ] ) approaches that of the multi - sheet solution ( which is not quite homogeneous in @xmath76 and @xmath77 ) as @xmath79 .",
    "for example , if @xmath127 , then the ansatz energy ( [ emin ] ) is only @xmath128 higher than that of the actual multi - sheet solution , and the fields are almost identical .    for @xmath112 , the multi - sheet solution has the lowest energy - per - charge of those that we investigated .",
    "however , the @xmath79 limit of this solution , and of the ansatz , is rather pathological , since the optimal values of @xmath73 tend to zero .",
    "in fact , the energy ( [ emin ] ) equals @xmath129 when @xmath10 ( and where we have put @xmath73 ) , from which it is clear that its minimal value is attained when @xmath130 . at first sight , this behaviour may seem paradoxical , since the usual view is that the fourth - order skyrme term in the energy prevents an object with nontrivial 3-dimensional topology from shrinking to zero volume .",
    "this view is indeed correct for @xmath131 : in particular , if @xmath20 lies in this range , then a triply - periodic configuration with nonzero topological charge @xmath1 has an energy which diverges if any of its periods tends to zero .",
    "but in the @xmath10 limit , namely for the skyrme - faddeev system , this property no longer holds .",
    "one can see directly from ( [ newcrys1 ] , [ newcrys2 ] ) , or rather its hopf projection , why this is so .",
    "if one scales each of the periods @xmath91 , then each term in the expression of the energy of @xmath43 scales differently .",
    "in particular , the term @xmath132 has the form @xmath133 where @xmath134 is its value when @xmath135 .",
    "this is the only term which prevents @xmath65 and @xmath66 from going to zero simultaneously .",
    "but for ( [ newcrys1 ] , [ newcrys2 ] ) the quantity @xmath136 is identically zero , and consequently one can always lower the energy by reducing @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "we have studied triply - periodic stable solutions ( local minima of the energy ) in a family of skyrme - type systems parametrized by @xmath8 $ ] , which interpolates between the standard skyrme model ( at @xmath9 ) and the skyrme - faddeev system ( at @xmath10 ) . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the lowest - energy crystal resembles a cubic lattice of half - skyrmion particles , and this picture persists near @xmath9 , as one would expect .",
    "but for larger values of @xmath20 , various other configurations are preferred ( that is , have lower energy - per - charge ) : for example , vortex - antivortex arrays and multi - sheet structures .",
    "all these structures are somewhat problematic in the @xmath79 limit , and it remains unclear whether or not there exists a smooth skyrme - faddeev crystal which is at least stable under small perturbations . as remarked in the introduction , the sublinear behaviour of the energy perhaps makes this unlikely . but the possibility remains open , and is worth further investigation .    * acknowledgments . * support from the uk engineering and physical sciences research council ( under grant ep / g038775/1 ) , and the uk science and technology facilities council ( under st / g000433/1 ) , is gratefully acknowledged ."
