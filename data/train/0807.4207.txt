    "the j - parc stands for the japan proton accelerator research complex , and it is located at tokai in japan @xcite . it is a joint facility between jaea ( japan atomic energy agency ) and kek ( high energy accelerator research organization ) for projects in various fields of science .",
    "the j - parc provides most intense proton beam in the multi - gev energy region .",
    "nuclear and particle physics projects use secondary beams such as kaons , pions , and neutrinos as well as the primary 50-gev proton beam .",
    "the construction is near completion and experiments will start soon .",
    "the first nuclear and particle physics experiments are on strangeness nuclear physics and neutrino oscillation .    as future hadron experiments",
    ", there are many possibilities .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to introduce `` possible '' high - energy hadron projects by using the primary proton beam of 30@xmath050 gev rather than to explain approved hadron experiments with kaon and pion beams .",
    "it is possible to investigate various aspects of hadron and nuclear structure by using the proton beam .",
    "they include clarification of flavor - dependent antiquark distributions at large bjorken @xmath4 and nucleon spin structure .",
    "the j - parc facility is expected to play a major role in the studies of hadron structure and hadronic many - body systems in a different kinematical region from rhic and lhc .",
    "this article consists of the following .",
    "first , the j - parc facility is introduced .",
    "then , we explain possible hadron - physics projects with the 30@xmath050 gev proton beam . in the last part , our studies on the parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions are discussed in connection with possible j - parc projects .",
    "finally , a summary is given .",
    "r0.48     +       [ fig : j - parc ]    the j - parc accelerator consists of a linac as an injector , a 3-gev rapid cycling synchrotron , and a 50-gev synchrotron as shown in fig . 1 @xcite .",
    "the j - parc provides most intense proton beam in the high - energy region ( @xmath5 gev ) .",
    "other proton accelerators have a beam power less than 0.1 mw , whereas the j - parc expects to have 1 mw in the 3-gev synchrotron and 0.75 mw in the 50-gev one .",
    "the j - parc has three major projects : ( 1 ) material and life sciences with neutrons and muons produced by the 3-gev proton beam , ( 2 ) nuclear and particle physics with secondary beams ( pions , kaons , neutrinos , and so on ) by the 50-gev proton beam and also with protons of the 50-gev primary beam , ( 3 ) nuclear transmutation by the linac .",
    "r0.48     +       [ fig : hadron - hall ]    nuclear and hadron - physics experiments will be done at the hadron experimental facility in fig .",
    "we should mention that there are also hadron topics on neutrino interactions with the nucleon and nuclei . in this article , we discuss high - energy hadron projects in the hadron hall , for which a beam - layout plan is shown in fig .",
    "the k1.8 is the first beamline which will be completed .",
    "it is intended to have kaons with momentum around 1.8 gev/@xmath6 for the studies on strangeness @xmath7 hypernuclei with @xmath8 by @xmath9 reactions .",
    "the k1.1/0.8 beamline is designed for low - momentum stopped kaon experiments such as the studies of kaonic nuclei .",
    "the neutral kaon beamline ( kl ) is for studying cp violating processes such as @xmath10 .",
    "the  high @xmath11 \" in fig .",
    "2 indicates the high - momentum beamline for 50-gev protons . in the beginning stage of j - parc ,",
    "the proton beam energy is 30 gev instead of the designed 50 gev . at a later stage",
    ", we expect to have 50 gev energy recovery .",
    "there are opportunities to investigate hadron and nuclear structure at high energies by using the high - momentum beamline in fig",
    ". 2 @xcite .",
    "there are proposals on hadron - mass modifications in a nuclear medium , drell - yan and charm - production processes , single spin asymmetries , elastic scattering , and high - energy spin physics with proton - beam polarization @xcite . in the following discussions ,",
    "additional topics are explained at the primary proton beamline from the author s personal point of view without restricting ourselves to the proposed experiments .",
    "there are two types of topics : ( 1 ) structure functions and related physics ( quark and gluon physics ) and ( 2 ) hadronic aspects .",
    "first , the structure functions have both aspects of nonperturbative and perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . in order to obtain information about internal structure of hadrons",
    ", one needs to subtract out the perturbative qcd part from cross sections . in order to obtain reliable results for the nonperturbative part ,",
    "higher - order qcd corrections need to be understood .",
    "it is known that such corrections , which are expressed by `` @xmath12 factors '' , are large in fixed - target experiments . in particular , the center - of - mass energy is relatively low : @xmath138 gev in the beginning and 10 gev later at the j - parc .",
    "it means that careful estimations are necessary for the pqcd ( perturbative qcd ) corrections .",
    "fortunately , there are significant developments in the recent years on resummations of soft - gluon radiations which give rise to large corrections at low energies .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the pqcd corrections converge if the resummations are properly taken into account at @xmath14 gev in the drell - yan processes .",
    "it means that drell - yan measurements are valuable for extracting information on various parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) because the perturbative part is theoretically under control . for charm - production processes ,",
    "we still need theoretical studies on such corrections @xcite .",
    "conversely , the large corrections mean that j - parc measurements are challenging and interesting for pqcd physicists in testing their high - order calculations .",
    "second , there are also interesting hadronic topics other than the structure functions and related topics .",
    "these projects could be appropriate especially at the 30 gev energy .",
    "possible projects include hadron masses in a nuclear medium , transition from hadron degrees of freedom to quark ones by elastic @xmath1 scattering , color transparency in @xmath2 reactions , short - range correlation in nuclear force by @xmath3 reactions , and generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) .",
    "these topics are explained in the following .",
    "r0.38     +       [ fig : dy ]    drell - yan ( @xmath15 ) measurements are important in establishing unpolarized pdfs , especially antiquark distributions at medium @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "for example , the fermilab - e866 measurements in fig . 3 played a key role in finding flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "they lead to investigations on a nontrivial aspect of nucleon structure @xcite , and physics mechanism could be related to peripheral structure of the nucleon such as pion clouds .",
    "the expected measurements by the fermilab - e906 and j - parc ( 50 gev ) extend the @xmath4 region to larger @xmath4 ( @xmath17 ) @xcite , where the e866 measurements did not probe . on the other hand , it is necessary to investigate possible mechanisms theoretically to create the difference @xmath16 at @xmath18 .",
    "the proton energy is 30 gev at the initial stage , and it could be too low to investigate the drell - yan process .",
    "one of possible projects with the 30-gev beam is to study @xmath19 and open - charm production processes @xcite .",
    "the @xmath19 production has been discussed as a possible signature of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in heavy - ion physics , so that it is important to understand its production mechanism .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath19 and open - charm production processes probe the gluon distributions in the nucleon and nuclei .",
    "we should note that the gluon distribution in the nucleon is not determined at large @xmath4 ( @xmath20 ) , and it is a major obstacle for finding new physics by high-@xmath21 jet events in hadron colliders .",
    "the j - parc is a large-@xmath4 facility which contributes to the pdf determination at large @xmath4 if a theoretical description is established for the charmed - meson productions .",
    "recently , parton energy loss became a hot topic in heavy - ion reactions because it is related to a qgp formation by suppression of high-@xmath21 mesons .",
    "there is also a development on this topic by the ads / cft correspondence . in order to discuss qgp properties ,",
    "it is necessary to describe the energy loss properly and to test it in an independent experiment .",
    "the drell - yan processes with nuclear targets provide a clean method to investigate the quark energy loss in a cold nuclear medium .",
    "the energy loss gives rise to nuclear modifications of quark momentum distributions before a @xmath22 annihilation , which results in changes of drell - yan cross sections @xcite .",
    "r0.38     +       [ fig : d - an ]    single spin asymmetries ( ssas ) can be investigated without proton - beam polarization .",
    "for example , the ssa for @xmath23-meson production has been estimated for the j - parc in fig . 4 @xcite . here , the asymmetry could be related to sivers functions , which describe unpolarized quarks in the transversely polarized nucleon , and they are related to angular momenta of quarks .",
    "it is important to note that j - parc measurements are sensitive to quark sivers effects , whereas rhic ones are to gluon sivers effects .",
    "the sivers functions can be also investigated by ssas in the @xmath24 drell - yan process .",
    "if a target is transversely polarized , transversity distributions and boer - mulders functions could be also measured by the ssa in the drell - yan @xcite .",
    "the ssa in @xmath1 elastic scattering was proposed as a possible experiment to investigate more details of observed anomalous asymmetries in the @xmath256 gev region at cern and bnl by extending the measurements to @xmath26 gev at j - parc @xcite .",
    "there exist new polarized structure functions for spin-1 hadrons due to their tensor structure nature .",
    "there are few experimental studies on them although spin structure of the spin-1/2 nucleon has been investigated extensively . at j - parc without the proton polarization ,",
    "tensor polarized distribution functions can be measured by proton - deuteron drell - yan processes with a polarized deuteron target @xcite .",
    "the tensor structure functions are known as @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the leading twist , and the first measurement was reported by the hermes collaboration in 2005 @xcite . however , experimental errors are large for discussing @xmath4 dependence .",
    "the @xmath29 drell - yan measurements at j - parc have an advantage over the hermes and future lepton - scattering measurements because antiquark tensor distributions can be measured for the first time and a sum rule @xmath30 could be studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "theoretically , we need to investigate mechanisms to create the tensor polarization in the quark level .",
    "recently , semi - inclusive reactions became important for investigating nucleon structure and properties of quark - hadron matters . in describing hadron - production processes ,",
    "fragmentation functions are necessary .",
    "a fragmentation function @xmath31 indicates the probability to produce a hadron @xmath32 from a parton @xmath33 with the energy ratio @xmath34 .",
    "they have been determined mainly by hadron - production cross sections in @xmath35 annihilation .",
    "however , the gluon function has a large uncertainty @xcite , which makes it difficult to reliably discuss any hadron - production cross sections in @xmath1 and @xmath36 . in hadron productions at j - parc ,",
    "cross sections are dominated by gluon - gluon interaction processes , so that they could be suitable for determining the gluon fragmentation function at large @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "we have introduced possible j - parc projects on partonic structure of hadrons . at 30 gev ,",
    "perturbative corrections are generally large , so that there are possibilities that partonic interpretations are difficult for some cross sections . in the following ,",
    "a few ideas are given on hadronic projects which are possible at both 30 and 50 gev energies although actual proposals have not been submitted yet except for the mass modification .",
    "chiral symmetry could play an important role in generating hadron masses because current quark masses are much smaller than hadron masses .",
    "chiral symmetry breaking leads to a finite quark condensate , which is reflected as hadron - mass modifications in a nuclear medium .",
    "it was proposed to measure the mass modifications of vector mesons ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "the modifications are theoretically expected due to partial restoration of the chiral symmetry .",
    "for example , recent kek - e325 experimental results indicated a 9% mass shift for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "much accurate data will be obtained at j - parc , so that the chiral dynamics will become clear in nuclei .",
    "cross sections for hadron reactions are described by hadron degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) , baryons and mesons , at low energies , whereas they should be described by quark d.o.f . at high energies .",
    "it is possible to investigate the transition from hadron to quark d.o.f . by measuring @xmath1 elastic cross sections at various proton energies . in the high energy limit",
    ", the elastic cross section should be described by gluon exchanges between constituent quarks , which gives rise to a counting rule : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total number of interacting elementary particles .",
    "this transition from hadron to quark d.o.f .",
    "has been observed in @xmath44 at @xmath452.5 gev @xcite .",
    "similar studies could be done for the @xmath1 scattering at j - parc .",
    "nuclear force has been investigated in terms of one - boson - exchange processes and also by effective quark models .",
    "direct relation to qcd is now being studied due to development of lattice",
    "short - range repulsion exists within the distance @xmath460.4 fm , and it is especially important for saturation properties of nuclei .",
    "there is an interesting experimental development on isospin dependence of the short - range correlation recently .",
    "the bnl experiment @xmath47 and jlab one @xmath48 at @xmath49 indicated that @xmath50 short - range correlation is twenty times larger than the @xmath1 one @xcite .",
    "the tensor force seems to play an important role in the short range ; however , this unexpected result needs to be explained theoretically . on the other hand",
    ", this result leads to a modification of neutron - star structure because a certain fraction of protons exist in the star .",
    "it should be possible to measure the @xmath47 reaction with better accuracy and with higher proton momentum ( namely shorter range ) at j - parc .    at large momentum transfer ,",
    "a small - size component of the hadron wave function should dominate in hadron cross sections .",
    "this small - size hadron could pass freely through a nuclear medium , which is called color transparency . at j - parc ,",
    "the @xmath2 reaction could be investigated for a nuclear target .",
    "nuclear transparency @xmath51 is defined by the cross - section ratio to the nucleonic one : @xmath52 . as the hard scale ( energy of the proton ) becomes larger , namely as the hadron size becomes smaller , the nuclear transparency should increase .",
    "such measurements were done at bnl up to the proton momentum 14 gev / c @xcite .",
    "the data indicated an interesting turnover at @xmath53 gev / c .",
    "first , we need to establish a theoretical model to explain the bnl results , and then measurements could be extended to 30@xmath050 gev / c region at j - parc for further studies",
    ".    generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) contain global information on the nucleon structure from low to high - energy region .",
    "the gpds become pdfs in the forward limit ( @xmath54 ) , where @xmath55 is momentum transfer squared and @xmath56 is a skewdness parameter .",
    "the first moments , namely the gpds integrated over @xmath4 , are form factors , and second moments are angular momenta of quarks .",
    "the second moments are especially important because contributions of angular momenta could solve the nucleon spin issue .",
    "the gpds have been measured in lepton scattering ; however , they could be also investigated by proton reactions in the erbl ( efremov - radyushkin - brodsky - lepage ) region @xmath57 .",
    "we may investigate @xmath58 @xmath59 and @xmath60 for measuring nucleonic and @xmath61 transition gpds at j - parc .",
    "a theoretical formalism is now being developed for such processes by using the 30@xmath050 gev proton beam @xcite .",
    "feasibility studies indicated that the primary proton beam can be polarized at j - parc @xcite . by double spin asymmetry experiments , the details of nucleon spin structure",
    "should be investigated . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , the j - parc probes the large-@xmath4 region ( @xmath18 ) . if the proton - beam polarization is attained , it is a complementary project to the rhic - spin in investigating a different kinematical region .",
    "the rhic measurements are generally sensitive to the smaller-@xmath4 region .    flavor dependence of the antiquark distributions , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , has been investigated by e866 as shown in fig .",
    "flavor dependence of the polarized antiquark distributions is scarcely known although there are some hints from semi - inclusive dis experiments for pion and kaon productions .",
    "j - parc drell - yan measurements on the double - spin asymmetry should be able to clearly answer the antiquark flavor dependence ( @xmath64 ) at @xmath18 .",
    "it is important for establishing the origin of nucleon spin and for testing models of producing the flavor asymmetric antiquark distributions .",
    "in addition , double spin asymmetry measurements are possible for hadron ( @xmath65 , @xmath19 , ... ) and direct - photon productions .",
    "these measurements should lead to a complete understanding of the nucleon spin from small @xmath4 to large @xmath4 together with measurements at other facilities .",
    "r0.42     +        +       in this last part of this article , our own studies are discussed on the pdfs in the nucleon and nuclei in connection with the j - parc projects .",
    "first , we have been investigating optimum nuclear pdfs by analyzing world data on structure function @xmath66 and drell - yan cross sections for nuclei . in fig . 5 , the current situation is shown for nuclear modifications of the pdfs in the calcium nucleus at @xmath67=10 gev@xmath68 @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties are shown by the shaded bands .",
    "we notice that antiquark distributions at @xmath18 and gluon distributions are not determined . by the drell - yan and charm - production processes at j - parc , we should be able to determine the antiquark distributions at @xmath18 and possibly also gluon distributions .",
    "second , the situation of the polarized pdfs is shown in fig",
    ". 6 @xcite .",
    "the distributions are not well determined in the polarized antiquark and gluon distributions .",
    "especially , the gluon distribution has a large uncertainty band , which is one of the reasons why the origin of the nucleon spin is not clarified .",
    "if the proton - beam polarization is attained at j - parc in future , these distributions can be investigated by the double spin asymmetries in drell - yan and hadron - production processes .",
    "third , fragmentation functions ( ffs ) could be investigated by hadron - production processes at j - parc .",
    "the ffs have been determined mainly by hadron productions in @xmath35 annihilation .",
    "we found in ref .",
    "@xcite that gluon and light - quark ffs have large uncertainties",
    ". the gluon function should be determined by hadron facilities such as rhic , lhc , and j - parc because gluon subprocesses dominate the small-@xmath21 part of hadron - production cross sections .",
    "in particular , the lower - energy j - parc probes the very large-@xmath37 region ( @xmath69 ) , so that measurements should be important for establishing fragmentation processes from a gluon .",
    "the hadron - physics experiments will start at j - parc in 2009 , and they are important for new developments in hadron and nuclear physics .",
    "the first project is on new many - body systems with strangeness by using pion and kaon beams . in this article , we focused on other hadron - physics projects at high energies by using the 30@xmath050 gev primary proton beam .",
    "the proposed drell - yan and charm - production experiments are valuable for clarifying the flavor dependence of antiquark distributions in the nucleon at @xmath18 , nuclear antiquark distributions , and possibly also the gluon distributions at large @xmath4 in the nucleon and nuclei .",
    "the parton - energy loss can be studied in the drell - yan . from single spin asymmetry measurements",
    ", it could be possible to learn about orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin .",
    "it is important to measure mass modifications of vector mesons in a nuclear medium for investigating chiral dynamics .",
    "there are other interesting projects in addition to these proposed experiments .",
    "they include new spin-1 structure , fragmentation functions , transition from hadron to quark d.o.f . , short - range correlation in nuclear force , color transparency , and gpds .",
    "if the proton beam is polarized , nucleon spin structure can be studied in details , for example , on the flavor dependence of polarized antiquark distributions . in the last part",
    ", we explained the current status of the pdfs and fragmentation functions , which are related to the j - parc projects , by global analyses of experimental data .",
