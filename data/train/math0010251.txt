    "@xmath293 ) . using these decompositions we define linear maps @xmath294 as follows @xmath295 this means that we can associate to an @xmath18-dimensional representation @xmath12 of @xmath267 a representation of the full bipartite quiver on @xmath296 vertices @xmath297 where we put at the left @xmath27-th vertex the space @xmath298 , on the right @xmath299-th vertex the space @xmath300 and the morphism connecting the @xmath27-th left vertex to the right @xmath299-vertex is the map @xmath294 .",
    "that is , to @xmath12 we associate a representation @xmath301 of dimension vector @xmath302 and of course we have that @xmath303 .",
    "if @xmath12 and @xmath17 are isomorphic as @xmath267 representation , they have isomorphic weight space decompositions for the restrictions to @xmath285 and @xmath286 and fixing bases in these weight spaces gives isomorphic quiver representations @xmath304 .",
    "further , observe that if @xmath12 is a representation of @xmath267 then the matrix @xmath305 is invertible and the determinant @xmath306 is a semi - invariant for @xmath5 of weight @xmath307 .",
    "that is , all representations of the form @xmath301 are @xmath0-semistable representations of @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath12 is an irreducible @xmath267 representation , then @xmath301 is a @xmath0-stable quiver representation .",
    "conversely , if @xmath308 is @xmath0-semistable such that @xmath309 , then @xmath310 for a representation @xmath12 of @xmath267 and if @xmath17 is @xmath0-stable then @xmath12 is irreducible .",
    "let @xmath308 such that @xmath311 and @xmath312 a subrepresentation of dimension vector @xmath313 .",
    "then , @xmath314 for if @xmath175 then @xmath315 and the composed map @xmath316 must have a kernel contradicting the fact that @xmath317 is an isomorphism . if @xmath318 , then @xmath319 and the restriction of @xmath317 to @xmath320 gives an linear isomorphism @xmath321 .",
    "finally , the decomposition @xmath322 determines the action of @xmath285 on an @xmath323-dimensional space @xmath324 and @xmath325 the action of @xmath286 on @xmath324 , that is , @xmath326 for a representation @xmath324 of @xmath267 .",
    "that is , the variety of semi - simple @xmath18-dimensional representations of @xmath267 decomposes into components @xmath327 ( where @xmath140 is the map @xmath328 described before ) which are affine open subsets of the projective moduli spaces of @xmath0-semistable representations of @xmath2 . in the next section we will determine the dimension vectors @xmath4 corresponding to irreducible representations .",
    "as an example , consider the infinite dihedral group @xmath329 , then the corresponding quiver is @xmath330 with orientation @xmath331 for @xmath332 we have @xmath333 and @xmath334 , the one point missing is the representation @xmath12 where all maps are the identity because in that case @xmath335 .",
    "in this section we will characterize the dimension vectors @xmath4 such that @xmath267 has irreducible representations @xmath12 such that @xmath301 has dimension vector @xmath4 . in view of the above",
    "we have to determine the dimension vectors of @xmath0-stable representations of @xmath2 .",
    "there are some obvious @xmath82-dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath267 @xmath336 which have dimension vector @xmath337 .",
    "we consider the quiver @xmath231 on @xmath338 vertices @xmath339 ( corresponding to the @xmath0-stable representations @xmath340 ) such that the number of arrows from @xmath339 to @xmath341 is equal to @xmath342 given the special form of the full bipartite quiver @xmath2 it is easy to verify that @xmath343 for example , in the modular case @xmath344 the quiver @xmath231 has the form of a large cycle with subsequent vertices @xmath345 and only one arrow in each direction between two consecutive vertices .",
    "we consider the direct sum of @xmath0-stable representations @xmath346 that is , the dimension vector of @xmath12 is @xmath347 . in view of theorem  [ simples ] to verify that there are @xmath0-stable representations of dimension vector @xmath4 is equivalent to verifying that @xmath348 is the dimension vector of a simple representation of @xmath231 .",
    "assume that @xmath4 is the dimension vector of a @xmath0-stable representation of @xmath2 , then the set of irreducible representations of @xmath267 is an open subset of @xmath11 .",
    "assume that @xmath353 and consider the vertex spaces ( the eigenspaces ) @xmath354 and @xmath355 as subspaces of the @xmath18-dimensional representation @xmath356 ( via the identification given by the matrix @xmath323 ) . then @xmath357 is a subrepresentation of @xmath12 of dimension vector @xmath358 for some @xmath359 .",
    "but @xmath99 so @xmath360 can not be @xmath0-stable , a contradiction .    conversely , assume the numerical condition is satisfied and consider the direct sum of @xmath0-stable representations @xmath361 we note that @xmath362 let @xmath363 be the @xmath364 identity matrix and let @xmath365 be the @xmath364 matrix of the form @xmath366 then the euler form of the local quiver @xmath231 is the symmetric matrix @xmath367 when @xmath368 , we have that @xmath369 is obviously a @xmath0-stable representation . when @xmath370 , we notice that @xmath371 is the dimension vector of a simple representation if and only if @xmath372 now , consider @xmath373 and consider the dimension vector @xmath348 .",
    "we have to verify that @xmath371 is the dimension vector of a simple representation of @xmath231 which , by symmetry of @xmath374 , amounts to checking that @xmath375 for all @xmath376 and @xmath377 where @xmath378 are the standard base vectors .",
    "computing the left hand term this is equivalent to @xmath379 or @xmath380 resubstituting the values of @xmath381 and @xmath382 in this expression we see that this is equivalent to @xmath383 therefore , the condition is satisfied if for all 1@xmath384 and @xmath377 we have @xmath385"
