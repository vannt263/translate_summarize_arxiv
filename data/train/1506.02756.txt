    "particle a may aggregate at lattice sites marked with circles labeled 1 to 4 , and particle b may aggregate at lattice sites marked with circles labeled 5 to 7 .",

    "if it does not aggregate there , it moves to the position labeled 2 , in which three aggregation trials are executed : two for interactions with the nn at the same height ( probability @xmath0 for each one ) and one for interaction with the nnn in the layer below , at the left ( probability @xmath26 ) .",
    "if the particle does not aggregate at position 2 , then it moves to position 3 and may aggregate there with probability @xmath0 due to the interaction with the nn at the left . if aggregation does not occur in position 3 , the incident particle will permanently aggregate at position 4 , which is the top of the incidence column . relaxation to neighboring columns is not allowed .",

    "if no aggregation trial is successful at position 6 , the particle moves to position 7 and aggregates there .",
    "in contrast to other ballistic - like models ( e. g. bd and bdnnn ) , the spd model allows subsurface aggregation . in fig .",

    "it represents two possibilities of aggregation in the ingoing part of the trajectory of the incident particle . if the aggregation trials are not accepted , then the incident particle moves to a lower position . in this situation ,",
    "this particle is in an outgoing trajectory respectively to those aggregated particles .",
    "for this reason , no aggregation trial is executed with a nnn aggregated particle in the layer above the current position of the incident particle .",
