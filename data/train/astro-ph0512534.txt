    "in contrast to the low mass stars , which are commonly accepted to form due to the gravitational collapse of a dusty cloud and the subsequent magnetically controlled accretion via a disc ( e.g. bertout 1989 ) , the formation of the most massive stars is still very much uncertain .",
    "part of this is due to the extreme rarity of these objects and the fact that they are very embedded in their molecular clouds , rendering them obscured . to make headway , it is important to study the optically visible herbig ae / be stars as these have masses intermediate between the two above cases",
    ". the herbig ae / be stars are now also found to mark the transition between the different formation mechanisms of low and high mass stars .",
    "recent studies indicate that the herbig ae stars present similar phenomena as t tauri stars ( vink et al .",
    "2003 , 2005 , see also hubrig , schller & yudin 2004 ) , whereas the herbig be stars are similar to the more embedded massive young stellar objects ( mysos , e.g. drew et al .",
    "1997 ) .    to learn more about their formation , it is necessary to probe the ( circum-)stellar environments of herbig ae / be stars at the small scales where many important features for the further evolution such as discs , outflows , and binaries are found .",
    "millimetre observations have detected discs in the size range of @xmath0 200 to 3000 au around herbig ae / be stars ( mannings & sargent , 1997 & 2000 ; pitu , dutrey & kahane 2003 ) , while near - ir coronagraphic observations of the herbig ae star hd 150193 ( fukagawa et al . , 2003 ) and the herbig be star hd 100546 ( grady et al . , 2001 ) reveal discs extending to @xmath0 190 and 515 au respectively .",
    "using spectropolarimetry , oudmaijer & drew ( 1999 ) and vink et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found evidence for even smaller scale discs , with sizes of the order of several stellar radii , around herbig ae / be stars .",
    "pre - main sequence binary fractions have been determined from ir imaging ( bouvier & corporon , 2001 ; leinert , richichi & haas 1997 ; pirzkal , spillar & dyck 1997 ; and li et al . , 1994 ) and optical spectroscopy ( corporon & lagrange , 1999 ) .",
    "these studies are based on limited samples of herbig ae / be stars , but from extrapolations of the detections , the inferred binary frequency is almost double that of solar type main sequence stars for the period range probed ( leinert et al .",
    "1997 ) , and of the same order as the t tauri stars ( khler & leinert , 1998 ) .",
    "in this paper we apply the technique of spectro - astrometry to study herbig ae / be stars .",
    "this method is particularly suited to detect binary companions of emission line stars , and as we will show , can detect secondaries as much as 6 magnitudes fainter than the primary . as such it is among the most powerful methods to investigate binary frequencies , while it has the potential to probe even closer to the star and detect small scale structures in the circumstellar material .",
    "the basic principle of spectro - astrometry is to measure the relative spatial position of spectral features from a longslit spectrum ( bailey , 1998 ) .",
    "this is achieved by obtaining high spectral resolution long - slit spectra of an object and determining the centre of the point spread function ( psf ) at each wavelength . in his pioneering paper , bailey ( 1998 ) already illustrated that spectro - astrometry is effective at finding binaries and outflow structures around herbig ae / be stars , focusing on the strong h@xmath2 emission of these objects .",
    "later studies have found outflows and binary signatures from a sample of t tauri stars ( e.g. takami , bailey & chrysostomou 2003 and references therein ) and an outflow from a brown dwarf ( whelan et al . 2005 ) .",
    "returning to the detection of binary stars , a system where only one of the components emits h@xmath2 displays a simple and easily detectable signature in the photo - centre of the spectrum . as the spatial profile is the sum of both stars ,",
    "the peak is not located at the position of either star , but somewhere between the components , depending on the intensity ratio - analogous to the centre of motion of binaries . because the h@xmath2 line intensity ratio changes across the line , the peak position shifts towards the h@xmath2 dominant star and the binary is revealed by an excursion in the positional spectrum .",
    "we also expect to see a decrease in the full - width - at - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of the spatial profile across h@xmath2 as it is dominated by only one star .",
    "this paper is the first to present and use this additional information that can be straightforwardly retrieved from the data .",
    "we will demonstrate later that the fwhm spectra have a strong diagnostic potential in assessing the properties of the objects under investigation .    in principle",
    "the method can be applied across any spectral line in which the intensity ratios of the two stars change from the continuum ratio ; in the case of an absorption line the peak position will move away from the star displaying the absorption .",
    "previously we reported on data of the pre - main sequence binary hk ori ( baines et al .",
    "2004 ) , the aim of the present work is to further develop the technique and apply it to a large sample of herbig ae / be stars .",
    "we observed 28 young herbig ae / be stars and 3 f - type pre - main sequence stars spectro - astrometrically .",
    "the observations are centred on h@xmath2 because the h@xmath2 emission line is usually by far the strongest feature in the spectrum of these objects .",

    "[ log ]    [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,>,^,^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,^,^ \" , ]      an additional question , already alluded to in the introduction addresses not only the formation of binary stars , but also the formation of the most massive herbig be stars - for which stellar mergers have been proposed ( see bonnell , bate & zinnecker 1998 ) . in the following we investigate whether the derived position angles from the binaries are of any help in this respect .",
    "a prediction from the above mentioned models concerns the alignment of the binary systems and the ( possibly accretion ) discs around the primary stars .",
    "capture models predict randomly oriented discs around both components of the binary , while fragmentation models predict co - planar discs around the stars . for the merger models to still result in a binary , we need a triple system to begin with .",
    "it is unlikely that the merger process will result in a disc aligned with the original tertiary component , hence random orientations would be expected , as also noted by bally & zinnecker ( 2005 ) .",
    "wolf , stecklum & henning ( 2001 ) and jensen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) present studies of t tauri stars and found the binary systems in their samples to be preferentially aligned with the discs , thus favouring the fragmentation model for low mass stars .",
    "a similar study was performed for herbig ae / be stars by maheswar , manoj & bhatt ( 2002 ) , who find that many herbig binaries are parallel or perpendicular to within 30@xmath5 from the broad band polarization .",
    "we have the sample in hand to improve this sort of studies and extend it to higher masses .",
    "to this end we draw on the spectropolarimetric results of vink et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2005 ) .",
    "inspired by the seminal work by poeckert & marlborough ( 1976 ) who proved the existence of discs around be stars with this method , they use the h@xmath2 line de - polarization to reveal the presence of small scale electron scattering discs around pre - main sequence stars .",
    "an advantage of this method is that the intrinsic angle of the polarization can be directly determined and is independent of the value of the interstellar polarization .",
    "the latter affects the previous broadband polarization studies ( see e.g. the discussion by jensen et al .",
    "2004 ) . for optically thin scattering , which is found to be the case for herbig ae /",
    "be stars ( vink et al . 2005 ) , the intrinsic polarization angle is perpendicular to the disc .",
    "as the polarization is due to electron - scattering , the discs are very small ( of order stellar radii ; cassinelli , nordsieck & murison , 1987 ) and we can be confident that the polarization traces the disc around the _ primary _ object and not a circumbinary disc .    the sample of objects with a pa determination for both the binary and the disc measured from the spectropolarimetry contains 7 targets .",
    "from this we have to exclude ab aur whose data on two occasions resulted in two different position angles indicating that the binary is too wide to believe the pa in the first place .",
    "we list the intrinsic polarization angles of the remaining stars in table  [ poltable ] .",
    "the majority of the objects ( 5 out of 6 ) have an angle difference to within @xmath6 20@xmath7 of perpendicular , indicating that the circumprimary discs and binaries are well aligned .",
    "xy per is the exception , with a difference of 6@xmath7 .    to get a quantitative handle on this finding we computed the cumulative distribution functions of the data and several assumed distributions , and then calculated the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) statistic . in fig .",
    "[ ks ] we show the cumulative fraction of the data , of a random distribution of angle differences and of several gaussian distributions with an average angle difference of 90@xmath8 .",
    "it can be seen from the figure that the data ( represented by the solid line ) are predominately found close to 90@xmath7 .",
    "the possibility that the data were drawn from a sample of stars where the discs and binary systems are randomly aligned is very small .",
    "the ks statistic returns a probability of 1.8% that this is the case .",
    "alternatively , we can reject the models that predict random orientations at the 98.2% confidence level .",
    "we now briefly investigate whether the models predicting aligned discs and binaries can be rejected with equal confidence or not .",
    "although the number of stars under consideration is too small to constrain the specific shape of the underlying distribution , comparing the data with some simple models will give an indication of the nature of the sample .",
    "we computed gaussian distributions with mean angle differences of 90@xmath7 and @xmath4s ranging from 35@xmath8 to 10@xmath7 .",
    "the gaussians were calculated over the range 0 - 180@xmath7 and then reprojected to cover 0 - 90@xmath8 as we investigate angle _ differences_. the results are also shown in fig .  [ ks ] . the broadest and narrowest distributions",
    "do not match the data at all , but the gaussians with @xmath4=20@xmath8 and @xmath4=25@xmath7 , values close to the experimental error , resemble the data comparatively closely .",
    "the ks test returns probabilities of 89% and 93% respectively that the data could be drawn from such a population .",
    "this provides strong evidence in favour of the fragmentation scenario that predicts aligned discs and against the stellar capture scenario which predicts random orientations .",
    "a final remark concerns the formation of the more massive stars .",
    "the spectral types covered by this sub - sample of objects extends to b0 , tracing masses exceeding the maximum possible mass that is accumulated in simple accretion models ( e.g. wolfire & cassinelli 1987 , bonnell et al .",
    "it appears that the stellar merger scenario which predicts random orientations is also ruled out by our finding .",
    "we have studied 31 young stars by means of spectro - astrometry , and find the following .    1 .",
    "a binary frequency of 68@xmath111% was found in the sample of 28 herbig ae / be stars . no other technique has been able to find such a high binary frequency in herbig ae / be stars , demonstrating the proficiency at which spectro - astrometry can detect binaries .",
    "2 .   there is a small hint that the herbig be stars are more likely to be found in binaries than the herbig ae objects ( 73@xmath9% versus 31@xmath10% , the latter rises to 62@xmath11% when the possible detections are included ) .",
    "this could indicate that herbig be stars are more likely to be found in binaries than their lower mass herbig ae counterparts .",
    "we detected asymmetric outflows from z cma and hd 87643 .",
    "we conclude that hd 87643 has a high velocity and low velocity outflow , towards the north .",
    "no evidence for jets was present in our data .",
    "4 .   we present evidence that the circumprimary discs are aligned with the binary systems .",
    "this favours the fragmentation scenario for the formation of herbig ae / be binaries over stellar capture models which predict randomly oriented discs . the next step is to identify the mode of fragmentation , i.e. whether the clouds break up in 2 fragments ( predicting roughly fixed mass ratios ) or multiple fragments , predicting random mass functions .",
    "5 .   the strong alignment , even for early b type stars ,",
    "provides evidence against the stellar merger scenario invoked to produce massive stars .",
    "instead , as these objects have been found to have discs in the first place , disc accretion remains a viable possibility ( cf .",

    "a spectro - astrometric signature from a binary will arise across a spectroscopic line if there is a difference in intensity from each component star . in the case of h@xmath2 emission from a binary system , it is highly unlikely that both components have the same h@xmath2 intensities and profiles .",

    "an increase in the positional displacement as the separation is increased will halt when the spatial profile of the two components becomes fully resolved .",
    "this occurs in figure [ simulations]a at _ d _ around 3.0 arcsec . at wide separations the technique of spectro - astrometry breaks down because only one profile ( in this case the primary star ) is fitted by the fitting program at both the continuum and h@xmath2 maximum , i.e. spectro - astrometry should only be applied to unresolved binaries . for a separation of 3.0 arcsec",

    "a decrease in the seeing increases both the positional and fwhm displacement . in this case , for a seeing of 2.0 arcsec and larger , the positional displacement is larger than the fwhm displacement .",
    "but for a seeing between 2.0 and 0.5 arcsec the fwhm displacement becomes larger than the positional displacement and the effect of the seeing is rather more significant in the fwhm displacements than in the positional displacements .",
    "it is therefore important to approximately know the intrinsic seeing before interpreting the spectro - astrometric signatures , particularly since the seeing can vary considerably between observations .",

    "interestingly , one still sees a positional and fwhm displacement across h@xmath2 , of 4.5 mas , when the secondary star is a 100th the intensity of the primary star ( i.e. a difference of 5 mag ) . as i@xmath12/i@xmath13 increases to 1 , the positional and fwhm displacements increase , and for this separation ( 0.5 arcsec ) , the positional displacements increase at larger increments than the fwhm displacements .    at i@xmath12/i@xmath13 @xmath22 1",
    "the h@xmath2 emitter is now the secondary star , and the primary has h@xmath2 in absorption . as i@xmath12/i@xmath13 increases ( from 2 upwards ) ,",
    "the positional displacements decrease until no displacement is present , when the h@xmath2 emitting star is too faint to contribute to the total h@xmath2 intensity of the system .",

    "the total h@xmath2 profile approximates to the h@xmath2 profile of i@xmath12 .",
    "a displacement of 6 mas in both the position and fwhm spectrum , is present when i@xmath12/i@xmath13 is as large as 300 ( a difference of @xmath0 6.2 mag ) . in this case",
    "no h@xmath2 emission is present in the total intensity spectrum , but the spectro - astrometry still detects the binary .",
    "the fwhm maximum displacements are largest when the primary and secondary star have similar intensities .",
    "when the primary is the h@xmath2 emitter ( i@xmath12/i@xmath13 @xmath23 1 ) the fwhm decreases across h@xmath2 , whereas when the secondary is the h@xmath2 emitter the fwhm increases .",
    "here we investigate the effect of changing the h@xmath2 intensity ratios , h@xmath15/h@xmath16 , whilst the seeing ( 1.5 arcsec ) , _ d _ ( 0.5 arcsec ) , and i@xmath12/i@xmath13 ( 1 ) are kept constant .",

    "the other component h@xmath2 profile is varied .",
    "the results are presented in figure [ simulations]d . at h@xmath15/h@xmath16 = 1 ( and in this case i@xmath12/i@xmath13 = 1 ) , the two component h@xmath2 profiles are identical , therefore we see no displacements in either the position or fwhm spectrum . as the value of h@xmath15/h@xmath16 moves further from 1",
    "the positional and fwhm displacements become larger . in the case of the position spectrum ,",
    "the displacements lie on either side of the position continuum , depending on which star is dominating ( i.e. for h@xmath15/h@xmath16 @xmath22 1 , and h@xmath15/h@xmath16 @xmath21 1 ) . in the case of the fwhm spectrum ( bottom panel ) , any value of h@xmath15/h@xmath16 @xmath24 1 will result in a decrease in the fwhm .      in the above simulations the h@xmath2 emission profile was kept as a simple single peaked profile .",

    "figures [ xypersims]b and c show examples of spectro - astrometric displacements when the primary star of a binary system has a double peaked h@xmath2 emission profile ( from mwc 158 ) or a p cygni h@xmath2 emission profile ( from ab aur ) . in both cases",
    "the secondary star has been chosen to have an h@xmath2 absorption profile with maximum absorption at 0.5 . for figure [ xypersims]b , the position and fwhm displacements return towards the continuum across the h@xmath2 minimum because the intensity of the primary diminishes .",
    "this produces a double peaked profile in both the position and fwhm spectra .",
    "the lower panels of figure [ xypersims]c shows an example of the position and fwhm spectra when the primary has a p cygni h@xmath2 profile . at the peak in the emission",
    "we see a typical binary signature , where there is a decrease in the fwhm and a displacement towards the emitting star in the position spectrum . at the p cygni absorption",
    "there is a displacement towards the secondary star as the intensity of the primary decreases . when i@xmath12/i@xmath13 @xmath21 1 the fwhm increases across the p cygni absorption , again because the intensity of the primary decreases and the secondary becomes more dominant than at the continuum .",
    "in figure [ xypersims]d both primary and secondary stars are emitting h@xmath2 . since xy",
    "per may be in a system with both components emitting h@xmath2 we choose to use binary parameters similar to xy per , i.e. _ d _ = 1.3 arcsec , i@xmath12/i@xmath13 = 0.6 , and seeing = 1.7 arcsec .",
    "the positional and fwhm displacements are similar to those of 23rd",
    "september 2002 of xy per in the ew direction .",
    "the triple peaked h@xmath2 profile of the secondary is not apparent in the total intensity spectrum , but does affect the positional and fwhm displacements .",
    "these simulations show how the spectro - astrometric signature from a binary is dependent on the separation of the component stars , the continuum intensity ratio of the two stars , the h@xmath2 profiles , and the seeing .",
    "the main conclusions from these simulations are : a ) the technique is capable of detecting binaries between separations of @xmath0 0.01 - 3.0 arcsecs , up to a @xmath25mag of 5 ( and as large as @xmath25mag = 6 if the secondary star dominates the h@xmath2 emission ) , for reasonable seeing values ( @xmath0 1.5 arcsec ) ; b ) the size of a positional displacement compared with that of a fwhm displacement is an important indication of the binary separation , i.e. binaries with separations approximately @xmath22 the slit width will have fwhm displacements as large as , or larger than , the positional displacements . as outlined by porter et al .
