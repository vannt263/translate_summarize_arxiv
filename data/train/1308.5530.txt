    "the plates of the channel are considered porous and flow within the channel is due to the uniform motion of the upper plate . such linear temporal stability analysis through a modified orr - sommerfeld equation has been made earlier by a. v. monwanou and j. b. chabi orou @xcite in a poiseuille flow without injection / suction .",
