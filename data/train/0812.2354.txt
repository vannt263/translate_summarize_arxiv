    "the idea of measuring the position of stars on the sky systematically and for a scientific purpose dates back to the 2nd century bc , when the greek astronomer hipparchus measured about 1000 stars naked eye .",
    "this has been repeated several times during the following centuries , with steadily increasing power and accuracy , until the most recent hipparcos satellite ( 1989 - 1993 ) that measured @xmath0 120,000 sources with @xmath0 1 mas accuracy and produced a catalogue ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "gaia is a cornerstone mission of the esa space program , that will perform an all - sky survey and produce accurate astrometry and photometry for about 1.5@xmath110@xmath2 objects down to a limiting magnitude of 20  mag , and additional spectroscopy for objects brighter than v=16 - 17 .",
    "this will allow to obtain a stereoscopic and kinematic view of the galaxy , and to address key questions of modern astrophysics regarding the formation and evolution of the milky way .",
    "such an observational effort has been compared to the mapping of the human genome for the impact that it will have in galactic astrophysics .",
    "in addition , gaia will provide a fundamental contribution in a much broader range of scientific areas ( see sect .",

    "an observing campaign has been started to ensure accurate and homogeneous data for a suitably large number of spss .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute calibrated data is expected to be @xmath0 1% to a few percent , depending on the number and spectral type of the spss and on the accuracy of their seds , and may vary with wavelength across the bp / rp spectra .    from the bp / rp spectral energy distributions it will be possible to estimate astrophysical parameters using pattern recognition techniques ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "the rvs spectra will provide information also on rotation and chemistry , and will allow to obtain more detailed and accurate astrophysical parameters than using the prism bp / rp spectra alone .",
    "all aspects of the gaia mission are charge and responsibility of esa , except the processing and analysis of the science data that are assigned to the european astronomical community . to this purpose",
    "the community has formed the data processing and analysis consortium ( dpac ) , that collects the contribution of nearly 400 scientists from 24 institutes of esa member states , and is structured in 9 coordination units dealing with all aspects of the data processing .",
    "in addition , a number of data processing centers ( dpcs ) are dedicated to the data handling and processing of specific parts of the pipeline , namely : esac ( spain ) , cnes ( france ) and the dpcs in barcelona , torino , toulouse , cambridge and geneva .",

    "one billion stars in 5-d ( 6-d if the radial velocity is available , and up to 9-d if the astrophysical parameters are know as well ) will allow to derive the spatial and dynamical structure of the milky way , its formation and chemical history ( e.g. by detecting evidence of accretion / merging events ) , and the star formation history throughout the galaxy . the huge and accurate database will provide a powerful testbench for stellar structure and evolution models . the possibility to obtain clean colour - magnitude ( and hence hr ) diagrams throughout the galaxy will lead to accurate mass and luminosity functions , as well as complete characterisation and dating of all spectral types and galactic stellar populations .",
    "the distribution and rate of microlensing events will allow to map the dark matter distribution .",
    "the cosmic distance scale will get a definitive and robust definition ( zero - point ) thanks to the very accurate distance ( i.e. luminosity calibration ) of the primary standard candles , rr lyraes and cepheids .",

    "globular clusters ( gcs ) are among the densest fields in the sky , and considering that the maximum density that gaia can handle is @xmath0 0.25 star arcsec@xmath28 not all of the 150 gcs known in the galaxy ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "* anderson & king ( 2006 ) ) is @xmath0 0.5 mas astrometric accuracy from acs / wfc data on well exposed images .",
    "this accuracy is indeed getting close to gaia s , but on a field of view of only about 200@xmath1200 arcsec@xmath32 .        at a distance of about 10 kpc ,",
    "the brightest features of m3 cm diagram , namely the upper rgb and the hb , are at v @xmath0 12.5 to 16 mag .",
    "therefore these stars will be observed with _ individual _",

    "* ferraro et al . 1997 ) ) , the distance to m3 can be known to about 0.5% or better .",
    "the most classical clock provided by stellar evolution theory for dating population ii stars is the luminosity of turn - off stars m@xmath12(to ) .",

    "we refer to the presentation by b. chaboyer ( this conference ) for more details on the intrinsic / systematic errors of theoretical models .",

    ", the error budget can be summarised as : + @xmath35 0.85@xmath36(v@xmath37 ) : error associated to the photometric determination of the to .",
    "extremely accurate and well defined main sequences can presently be obtained with instruments such as the hst and other large ground - based facilities , however the isochrones are nearly vertical at the to , and v@xmath37 is rather difficult to define .",

    "the accuracy on age determination has been claimed to be as low as @xmath910% ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gratton et al . 2003 ) ) .",
    "however , before further improvement can be achieved systematic errors need to be solved , for example on chemical abundance determination ( by defining the calibrating solar mixture and metallicity scale ) , on helium abundance determination ( which is confused by the possible presence of multiple populations ) , on the definition of a homogeneous reddening scale .",
    "gaia will do its share to improve absolute age by acting on most of the above items : + i ) clean cmds and very accurate photometry at the level of the turn - off will allow to obtain a more precise definition and estimate of the observed v@xmath37 .",

    "+ ii ) the reddening will be monitored by gaia for each object as part of the astrophysical parameter determination and may not be very accurate individually , but the statistical use of all cluster stars could lead to a rather accurate mean estimate . to be conservative , we assume a factor two improvement in the accuracy of the reddening values .",
    "+ iii ) similarly , @xmath10 $ ] will be estimated as part of the astrophysical parameter determination , and the mean of hundreds / thousands stars will carry rather low internal errors .",
    "iv ) the most important contribution , however , will be on the distance determination , by greatly reducing the error on distance ( e.g. by a factor 10 at 10 kpc ) .",
    "+ altogether , we expect that _ absolute _ ages can be known to @xmath0 5% or better .",
    "open clusters ( ocs ) are much looser than gcs and will be completely observable to the centre by gaia .",
    "therefore , the same type of analysis described for gcs in sections [ s : gc ] and [ s : m3 ] can be applied to the entire stellar population for each and all of the presently known ocs .",
    "in addition , gaia data may well be able to identify new ( faint / loose ) clusters .",
    "the pleiades have been studied extensively in the last decade , and very similar parallax values have been found by various authors : @xmath38=7.59@xmath390.14 mas from ms fitting ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "however , from the new reduction of hipparcos data ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van leeuwen ( 2007 ) ) finds @xmath38=8.18@xmath390.13 mas .",
    "this discrepancy of about 8% in the distance determination will be resolved unambiguously by gaia .",
    "since all the stars of the pleiades are brighter than v=15 , they will have _ individual _ parallaxes determined to better than 0.1 - 0.2% , and the distance and internal stellar distribution will be derived with extremely high precision .",

    "this discrepancy is far too large and definitely not acceptable for what is supposed to be the basic luminosity / distance calibrator and the first step in the cosmic distance scale .",
    "gaia will obtain the parallax of rr lyr to @xmath8 0.1% and the trigonometric distances to _ all _ the field rr lyraes within 3 kpc with _ individual _",
    "accuracy @xmath443% ( better than 30% for most galactic rr lyraes ) .",

    "classical ( pop i ) cepheids are several magnitudes brighter than rr lyraes , and can be observed in many spiral and irregular galaxies as far as 25 mpc ( thus reaching the fornax and virgo clusters ) with the use of the hst and other large ground - based or space telescopes .",
    "the hipparcos data provided the first opportunity to calibrate independently the critical parameters in the period - luminosity - colour ( plc ) relation for classical cepheids in the galaxy .",
    "hipparcos measured parallaxes for about 250 cepheids , @xmath0 100 of which with parallax accuracies of 1 mas or less . with the use of these data and additional hst parallax measures for 10 of these stars , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van leeuwen et al . ( 2007 ) ) derived a new calibration of the plc relation leading to a distance modulus for the lmc of 18.48@xmath390.03 mag ( no metallicity correction ) , and hence h@xmath46=70@xmath395 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 .",
    "this is certainly an excellent result , but is still affected by uncertainties due to the various parameters involved in the definition of the calibration itself .",
    "gaia is expected to measure distances to @xmath84% for all galactic cepheids ( @xmath81% up to 3 kpc ) , therefore will provide a definitive resolution of the controversy about the zero - point of the plc relation , as well as about the dependence on period , colour and metallicity .",
    "cepheid parallaxes can also be measured by gaia in extragalactic systems such as the sagittarius dwarf galaxy with @xmath47 10% , and the magellanic clouds with @xmath48 @xmath950% for all stars with period longer than @xmath010 days ( @xmath49 4.2 mag ) .",
    "+ this will allow to reach a few fundamental goals : + i ) define a very accurate plc relation , including the possible dependence on metallicity ; + ii ) establish the distance to the lmc on a completely trigonometric basis , and improve its accuracy with the additional help of the galactic calibration relation ; + iii ) establish the universality of the plc relation , namely its applicability to all galaxies and hence the possibility to derive h@xmath46 and the age of the universe . + * @xmath35 metal - poor sub - dwarfs *    within the context of distance determination , metal - poor subdwarfs are very important as they constitute the reference frame for gc main sequence stars of similar metallicity .",
    "the availability of the high precision hipparcos parallaxes prompted numerous determinations of distances to several galactic gcs using this main sequence fitting method .",
    "we refer the reader to e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* gratton et al . ( 2003 ) ) for a detailed description and review .",
    "however , hipparcos provided precise enough parallaxes only for @xmath0 30 metal - poor subdwarfs with @xmath50 5.5 to 7.5 mag ( i.e. 2 - 4 mag below the to ) . since the required astrometric accuracy could only be obtained within limiting magnitude v @xmath0 10 , this allowed to sample a rather small volume of the local neighborhood within 30 - 80 pc ( and hence the small number of metal - poor stars ) .",
    "gaia s limiting magnitude to v @xmath0 15 will allow to measure metal - poor subdwarfs in the same range of absolute magnitude as far as @xmath0 800 pc with astrometric accuracy better than @xmath0 3% .",
    "several thousands are expected , thus providing a much better statistics and finer sampling in metallicity for a more accurate fitting to any given gc main sequence .",
