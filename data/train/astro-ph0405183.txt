    "a central issue in the design of a radio astronomical correlating array is its configuration .",
    "the placement of the antennas determines the sampling of the fourier transform of the sky brightness distribution @xcite and hence the fidelity of the image computed from the interferometric data .",
    "the placement of the antennas also affects the cost of the array by determining the costs of power and signal distribution , site preparation , roads , and other infrastructure items .",
    "typically these considerations lead to trade - offs that must be considered in the design .",
    "antenna arrays use earth rotation aperture synthesis to sample the @xmath0 plane over time as the earth rotates . for arrays which are required to operate over a wide range of declinations and for arrays where instantaneous capabilities are important",
    ", two - dimensional array configurations must be considered .",
    "two - dimensional arrays offer the instantaneous @xmath0 coverage necessary to perform the above tasks .",
    "the point spread function , or beam , of an array is the fourier transform of the @xmath0 plane .",
    "the beam is easily computed from the coordinates of the antennas .",
    "unfortunately , there is no analytic solution to the inverse problem of creating an array configuration for a desired beam .",
    "the first large two - dimensional radio astronomical array was the very large array @xcite which has a three - armed @xmath1-shaped configuration .",
    "this configuration was first considered because it incorporated straight lines of antennas yet also distributed the antennas over a two dimensional region .",
    "the ability of such a configuration to cover the @xmath0 plane was supported by empirical studies of the transfer function , and positions within the @xmath1 were chosen through an optimization procedure . in more recent work , various procedures for optimizing the performance of two - dimensional arrays have been developed @xcite .",
    "these studies focused on array performance as the sole objective , and involved a relatively small number of antennas .",
    "radio interferometric arrays such as the atacama large millimeter array , the allen telescope array , the square kilometer array , and the low frequency array ( lofar ) , take advantage of advances in signal processing to construct a large aperture from a large number of relatively small antenna elements , or stations . for these arrays ,",
    "the cost of connecting the stations can be a significant fraction of the total cost .",
    "as part of the design effort for lofar , we have performed an optimization of two - dimensional configurations with two objectives considered simultaneously , array performance and cable length .",
    "we have developed models for array performance and cost that provide metrics used in the optimization .",
    "it is generally recognized that array performance is improved as the beam sidelobe level is minimized , and that optimizing the beam of an instantaneous monochromatic observation centered at zenith allows for good imaging quality of the array ( see for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "parseval s theorem implies that the beam sidelobe level can be minimized by uniform sampling in the @xmath0 plane  @xcite .",
    "depending on the scientific goals of the user , it may be better to optimize on either the beam shape or the @xmath0 distribution . here",
    "we adopt an approach similar to cornwell s and construct a metric based on a uniform @xmath0 distribution . for the opposing metric of cost , we focus on the length of the cable required to connect all the stations . as information on costs associated with cable laying and the constraints provided by terrain becomes available ,",
    "the cost metric can be made more sophisticated .",
    "we describe our models and simulation in detail in section  [ msi ] .",
    "we have developed a framework , based on a genetic algorithm , for rapid exploration of the objective space pertaining to multiple objectives .",
    "previous work by @xcite suggests that the objective space is highly nonlinear with respect to the beam computation , and that the surfaces representing the performance metric being optimized can be complex .",
    "gradient search techniques are prone to getting trapped in local minima .",
    "thus , the use of heuristic techniques such as simulated annealing , neural networks , and genetic algorithms , which are all better at handling nonlinear objective spaces , need to be used , though , these all require greater computational resources .",
    "genetic algorithms have been used in the past for antenna array design by @xcite and @xcite , but have focused on compact arrays affected by antenna coupling effects .",
    "they showed that genetic algorithms are good at solving general array configuration optimization problems . here",
    "we focus on optimizing for spatially large , sparse arrays for astronomical imaging performance .",
    "genetic algorithms also have the advantage that they produce many configurations in a single run , giving a `` pareto front '' @xcite of many optimal solutions at once .",
    "in contrast , simulated annealing and neural networks converge to a single solution , requiring several simulation runs to determine a pareto front . a discussion of our framework for multiobjective optimization is given in section  [ fmo ] .",
    "research dealing with the placement of nodes in network design has been conducted in networking in electrical engineering . from the early 1990 s until recently",
    ", a large body of research was devoted to the base station ( bs ) location problem for cellular phone networks . at that time",
    "the problem was to find the optimal location of bs ( transmitters ) in order to satisfactorily cover subscribers in @xmath2-space .",
    "although this problem differs in many aspects from the radio telescope array problem ( notably because here stations are connected via cables and the goodness of placement is a strongly non - linear function of all stations in the array ) , it is insightful to review the methods used . these range from dynamic programming @xcite , to genetic algorithms @xcite , @xcite and tabu search @xcite .",
    "some of these non - trivial communication models take into account the limitations imposed by the terrain .    in section  [ results ]",
    "we present our results for station placements and visibility placements , and the explored objective space for 27- , 60- 100- and 160-station configurations .",
    "the 27-station example allows a comparison with the well - known vla configuration ; the other simulations are for station numbers within the range planned for lofar .",
    "one may ask whether the optimal configurations found by the multiobjective optimization framework in section  [ results ] are indeed pareto optimal , or whether the results are biased by the use of genetic algorithms .",
    "for this reason array optimization was carried out with simulated annealing in section  [ sa ] .",
    "this serves to benchmark and confirm the configurations found earlier and broadens our understanding of the performance versus cost tradeoff in telescope array design . in section  [ conclusions ]",
    "we present our conclusions and our plans for future work .",
    "design parameters are quantities that stay fixed during optimization , but are changed when exploring different designs .",
    "we have three key parameters in our simulations .",
    "the first is simply the number of stations , @xmath4 , which determined the number of visibility points , @xmath5 according to    @xmath6    ( note that because of the hermitian property of the visibility function , the number of _ independent _ visibility points is half this number ) .",
    "the number of stations has a great effect on both the required cable length and the number of @xmath0 points in the visibility plane .",
    "the second parameter is the desired radial distribution of the @xmath0 points in the visibility plane .",
    "parseval s theorem ensures that minimizing sidelobe levels can be achieved simply by requiring that no two @xmath0 points in the fourier plane be redundant @xcite .",
    "cornwell implemented and expanded upon this by maximizing the mean distance between @xmath0 points as a means to acquire the least redundant @xmath0 spacing . in this paper we present results for a uniform @xmath0 distribution ( @xmath7 ) , leaving more centrally condensed concentrations , as is desired for lofar , for future work .",
    "figure [ nom_grid ] shows a nominal uniform @xmath0 distribution for a 27-station configuration .",
    "other radially symmetric @xmath0 distributions may be considered as well , i.e. power law or gaussian distributions , which are not pictured here .",
    "the third parameter is a size constraint imposed on the placement of stations . in accordance with lofar site constraints ,",
    "we have chosen our terrain to be a circle with diameter of 400 kilometers . often large arrays are restricted to a certain piece of land and a size constraint is necessary in the optimization of the station placements . as will be seen in section  [ results ]",
    ", circular configurations fill the uv space more than that of reuleaux triangle configurations that are size constrained .",
    "unconstrained simulations may yield different interesting results which may have larger geometric shapes , such as the reuleaux triangle , appearing as the maximum performance configuration .",
    "studies with unconstrained optimizations will need to be done in future work      design variables are the quantities that are allowed to vary during optimization .",
    "the design variables for the optimizations we carried out are the @xmath2 positions of the stations in the antenna plane .",
    "the number of design variables depends on the design parameter of number of stations , @xmath8 , and is just twice this number .",
    "the @xmath2 positions are varied throughout the simulation to obtain an optimal set of solutions .",
    "we initialized the @xmath2 positions of the stations according to the well - known topologies shown in figure [ init_seed ] , including @xcite circular arrays , @xcite reuleaux triangles , and vla - like configurations .",
    "we chose these seeds to search for improvements on already known configurations that perform well .    in order to explore new regions of the objective space we initially experimented with seeding our simulations with non - geometric arrays ; for example , arrays of antennas whose placements were chosen randomly from a uniform distribution in the @xmath2 plane .",
    "optimization attempts initialized exclusively with non - geometric seeds never successfully evolved to the more geometric non - dominated configurations shown in section  [ results ] . in other words",
    ", we were more successful in generating optimal arrays starting from geometric seed solutions rather than trying to evolve from purely random initial seeds .",
    "an interesting discussion on the role of randomness and entropy in array design is provided in section  [ sa ] .",
    "the difficulty in finding unique geometric configurations in the large space of possible antenna designs is the main challenge addressed in this paper",
    ". sections [ results ] , [ sa ] & [ conclusions ] will address this problem further .",
    "design objectives quantify the array designer s desired properties of the array , and require that metrics be defined that allow the genetic algorithm to evaluate the fitness of a particular design .",
    "the choice of metrics can be changed to demonstrate trade - offs between any metrics the user desires .",
    "we have chosen our metrics based in part upon speed in computing the algorithms as well as balancing imaging performance and infrastructure cost .",
    "it is important to note that the choice of the algorithms used in evaluating the metrics is up to the user and the goal that is in mind .",
    "the first metric we chose is that of the cable length , @xmath9 , which is to be minimized . for any configuration of stations",
    ", there is an analytic solution to the minimum cable length problem ( also known as steiner s problem in graphs @xcite or minimum spanning trees @xcite ) .",
    "we used the single linkage algorithm @xcite in the simulations .",
    "in general , steiner s problem also addresses the issue of the minimum _ cost _ of laying cable by associating rules for costing with the placement of the antennas . for now , without further information on the relationship between cable length and cost , we assume that each unit of cable length is of uniform cost and that simply minimizing the cable length is sufficient . information providing cable laying costs , or something comparable ( i.e. , site - specific maps ) can be used to minimize cost instead of length .",
    "we validated the cable length minimization code used in the optimization through comparison to simple geometries and specific test cases .",
    "the second metric we chose is that of the imaging performance of the array , which is to be maximized .",
    "cornwell s algorithm maximized the mean distance between @xmath0 points as a way to eliminate redundant points in the @xmath0 plane .",
    "elegant as this analysis is , it is very computationally expensive and thus not well suited for optimizations with as many as the 160 stations considered here .",
    "we have developed a lower - ordered algorithm , similar to cornwell s , to calculate the distribution of @xmath0 points for a much larger number of stations .",
    "our method first calculates a nominal grid for the number of stations .",
    "the nominal ideal grid consists of @xmath0 points placed according to a radially uniform distribution , and then spaced equally in azimuth at each radius . at each radius , the azimuthal component of the @xmath0 points in the nominal grid",
    "is given a slight random offset to induce another level of non - redundancy ( figure [ nom_grid ] ) .",
    "the nominal grid is calculated once per simulation and used as a benchmark for the evaluation of each design considered in the optimization .",
    "actual @xmath0 distributions are calculated from eqs .",
    "[ eq_u ] @xmath3 [ eq_v ] , where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the ground positions of the stations measured in a convenient set of units , such as kilometers or wavelength :    @xmath12    where  @xmath13  @xmath3  @xmath14  @xmath15 .",
    "an actual @xmath0 point from a design is associated with the nearest @xmath0 point in the nominal grid .",
    "if one or more @xmath0 points are associated with a nominal grid point , the nominal grid point is considered filled .",
    "@xmath16 is the number of nominal grid points which have an actual @xmath0 point associated with them .",
    "the metric is defined by counting all nominal grid points which have been filled ( @xmath16 ) and subtracting them from the total number of @xmath0 points ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "this difference is then divided by the total number of @xmath0 points to give the metric @xmath18 , which is the percentage of nominal grid points that are not filled :    @xmath19    this metric always returns a number between zero ( ideally ) and one , the latter hypothetically indicating that all nominal @xmath0 points are unfilled .",
    "it is desired to have all of the nominal baselines filled , thus having the array performance metric , @xmath18 , be zero .",
    "usually this is not physically possible , but our goal is to sample the fourier plane as uniformly as possible .",
    "greater sampling with lower signal - to - noise is desired over a higher signal - to - noise of fewer fourier components @xcite .",
    "our definition of @xmath18 ensures that the smaller the deviation from the nominal case , the better the design appears in the optimization .",
    "we have implemented a genetic algorithm @xcite with tournament selection @xcite for the framework of the optimizations .",
    "genetic algorithms are based upon darwin s theory of evolution ( darwin 1859 ) using ideas of an evolving population which improves by combining station placement information from different configurations ( mating ) , by discarding poor designs ( selection ) , and by randomly changing the population to promote diversity ( mutation ) .",
    "we chose to use a genetic algorithm as the main optimization method for a couple of reasons .",
    "first , the genetic algorithm method , like simulated annealing @xcite and neural networks @xcite , is heuristic , using randomization and statistical techniques instead of gradient searches . as we discussed in section 2 ,",
    "our metrics are highly nonlinear , and gradient searches are likely to get trapped in local minima .",
    "second , genetic algorithms are a population based technique .",
    "this means that they will produce many optimized configurations simultaneously , which is very beneficial for multiobjective optimization where a pareto front of solutions is desired .",
    "they also allow many different initial guesses for the configurations to be considered at once .",
    "the design of our genetic algorithm involved choices in the operators of selection , crossover , and mutation . in the selection ,",
    "we wish to filter the population so that the best members are kept and the worst are discarded .",
    "many different types of selection routines have been developed for genetic algorithms ; we have chosen tournament selection ( pohlheim 1997 ) .",
    "tournament selection takes two different members of the population ( in our case two array configurations ) and compares them according to the metrics .",
    "the better of the two designs is retained while the loser is discarded . in multiobjective optimization it is possible",
    "that one member is better in one metric while the other member is better in the second metric ; in this case both configurations are copied once into the next generation . if one is better in both metrics , it is coped twice and therefore has a greater effect on the next generation .",
    "we chose tournament selection because it requires no weighting of the objectives at the time of selection .",
    "rather , weighting can be applied after the optimization and is independent of it , as we discuss further below .",
    "the crossover operator implements the mating part of the algorithm . in our crossover",
    "routine , station @xmath2 coordinates are swapped between stations , making different combinations of array configurations .",
    "one hopes that as the generations evolve , good configurations will dominate and propagate through the population .",
    "convergence is reached when the changes in the individual members of the population become small .",
    "the mutation operator introduces small random changes in the @xmath2 coordinates of the station placements , allowing an individual station to move to a completely new place .",
    "mutation is done to keep diversity in the population and to explore parts of the objective space that might not be reached by selection and crossover alone .",
    "an additional operator , elitism , was added to the framework to give us control in emphasizing the population in different parts of the objective space .",
    "elitism allows us to make copies of any configuration and insert them into the population , randomly replacing other designs .",
    "we chose to add additional configurations of anchor solutions to expand the pareto front near the anchor solutions .",
    "the process of selection , crossover , mutation , and elitism are repeated , improving the population through generations .",
    "figure [ flow ] shows the flow of our framework .",
    "multiobjective optimization introduces a trade off between the design objectives , producing an optimal family of solutions which is a subset of the objective space .",
    "figure [ design_space ] shows a schematic representation of a two - dimensional ( two objective ) objective space with important features identified .",
    "the non - dominated solutions are defined as the set of feasible solutions such that there are no other solutions in the objective space which improves one design objective without reducing the optimality in another design objective .",
    "the subset of optimal solutions is all of the non - dominated solutions which lie on or near the pareto front @xcite .",
    "the pareto front is a theoretical front made up of non - dominated solutions with full convergence .",
    "our results presented in section  [ results ] show all solutions which we find to be non - dominated .",
    "there are two types of solutions on the pareto front which are of special interest : the `` anchor points '' and the `` nadir - utopia point . ''",
    "the anchor points are the points on the pareto front which achieve the best value of one of the design objectives subject to the constraints and fixed parameterizations of the problem formulation . in our optimizations , since there are two objectives , there are two anchor points .",
    "the nadir - utopia point is found by first normalizing the axes with respect to the anchor points located at opposite corners of the normalized objective space . in the presentation of our simulations both anchor points have been rescaled to a value of unity .",
    "the `` utopia point , '' or the theoretical optimum which is not achievable in practice , is at the corner of the objective space that represents improvement in both design objectives ( the origin in our plots ) .",
    "the nadir - utopia point is defined as the point on the pareto front which is at the minimum euclidean distance , @xmath20 , from the utopia point in the normalized coordinate system :    @xmath21    where @xmath22 represents the utopia point , @xmath23 represent points on the pareto front , and @xmath24 are the normalizations of the axes on the objective space plot .",
    "different relative weighting of the objectives can be implemented by different scalings of the axes , resulting in different nadir - utopia points .",
    "we performed optimizations for arrays of 27- , 60- , 100- , and 160- stations .",
    "table [ simpar ] shows the parameters used in these optimizations : the number of @xmath0 points ( @xmath17 ) , and the genetic algorithm parameters of population size , number of generations , mutation rate , elitism rate , and crossover rate .",
    "the population is the number of designs which are being operated upon by the optimizer at one iteration .",
    "as the number of stations increases , the number of design variables increases accordingly and this usually requires a larger population to maintain diversity throughout the simulation . as the population increases , so does the computation time .",
    "the number of generations determines how many iterations the optimizer runs through and is set at a high number to assure convergence in the solution .",
    "the mutation rate determines the number of random station position shifts per generation .",
    "this allows different parts of the objective space to be explored .",
    "the elitism rate determines the number of anchor points which are reinserted back into the next generation to aid in expanding the objective space near the anchor points .",
    "the crossover rate determines how many designs from the population are mated per generation .",
    "crossover is the essential operation in genetic algorithms , as it is used to pass on desired characteristics throughout an optimization run .",
    "all runs were done on a pentium 4 2000  mhz machine with 1 gigabyte of ram .",
    "since the algorithms used in the models go as @xmath25 , the times for simulations also increase by roughly @xmath25 , making it much more computationally intensive as the number of stations increases .",
    "the execution time for each simulation is given in table [ simpar ] .",
    "figures [ 27 ] - [ 160 ] show the 27- , 60- , 100- , 160-station configurations .",
    "each figure consists of six panels .",
    "the top three panels in each figure show the @xmath2 station placements .",
    "the stations are circled and cable connections are shown with lines .",
    "the bottom three panels show the @xmath0 coverage corresponding to the @xmath2 station placements directly above them . from left",
    "to right the configurations presented are those of minimum cable length , nadir - utopia , and maximum array performance .",
    "the minimum cable length and maximum array performance configurations are the anchor solutions defined in section  [ pareto ] .",
    "the cable length metric is given in kilometers assuming an overall array diameter of 400  km ( the lofar specification ) , and the array design metric , @xmath18 ( defined in the figures as @xmath26 ) , is given as the fraction of empty nominal @xmath0 baselines with respect to the total number of baselines .",
    "results are presented for an equal weighting of the objectives .",
    "smaller values are better for both metrics .",
    "the two objectives of minimizing the cable length and achieving the desired @xmath0 distribution oppose each other .",
    "the first tends to clump stations together to reduce cable length , while the latter tends to spread stations apart to obtain new @xmath0 points .",
    "our multiobjective optimization is a way of searching the configuration space for good trade - off solutions .",
    "the solutions display a wide pareto front showing the trade - off between decreasing cable length , and thus decreasing cost , and improving array performance . along the pareto",
    "front designs range from vla - like structures to ring - like structures .",
    "non - geometric arrays whose stations are placed randomly are clearly not pareto - optimal .",
    "this statement is confirmed by simulated annealing in section  [ sa ] .",
    "one expects minimal cable anchor solutions to be highly condensed designs , but it should be noted that there needs to be a minimum performance that we , as array designers wish to consider , or the minimum cable anchor solution will always be a highly condensed array with all stations clumping to a point .",
    "solutions that have vla - like configurations are chosen to be the minimum cable configurations under consideration .",
    "we have chosen the vla as the minimum cable configuration because designs with lower cable length also tend to have vla - like characteristics , but do not stretch out to the outer boundaries of the @xmath2 plane .",
    "in general , minimum cable solutions appeared as slightly randomized vla - like configurations , while best array performance was achieved by ring - like configurations with inward reaching arms .",
    "solutions near the nadir - utopia point consisted of hybrid solutions of different initial seeds and reuleaux triangles .",
    "figures  [ 27ds ] - [ 160ds ] show the 27- , 60- , 100- , and 160-station objective spaces .",
    "the axes of all the objective spaces are set to the same length so as to facilitate comparisons between the different objective spaces for the different numbers of stations .",
    "cable length is on the x - axis , while the @xmath0 density metric , @xmath18 , is on the y - axis .",
    "@xmath27 density metric values can range from close to zero ( filled aperture ) , to nearly one ( very poor @xmath0 coverage ) . since the best solutions presented here asymptote at above 0.25 , this is given as a lower boundary on the axis .",
    "since vla - like designs were chosen as the minimum cable configurations ( @xmath0 density values @xmath28 0.55 ) , the upper boundaries of the @xmath0 density metric were cut off at an arbitrary value of 0.75 to show a few designs which achieved lower cable lengths and lower performance but are still formally pareto optimal .",
    "the objective spaces show the initial seeds , the theoretical pareto front , the actual non - dominated solutions , and the evolution of the population over generations .",
    "initial seed families were inserted with varying azimuthal or radial distributions .",
    "this can be seen in the ( a ) panel of the objective spaces as a spread in the performance metric for all cases .",
    "this was done to introduce another level of diversity into the initial population .",
    "an interesting , and unexpected result , that can be seen in the objective spaces is that the population increasingly evolves away from the pareto front as the number of stations increases .",
    "this observation is discussed in further detail throughout the rest of the paper , but is worth noting here . in these cases ,",
    "the genetic algorithm framework fills in the gaps between different initial seeds by hybridization , and also expands the pareto front near the anchor solutions .",
    "it does not , however , expand the pareto front near the nadir - utopia point for the metrics that were chosen .",
    "how do genetic algorithm results compare to that of past work ?",
    "work that has been done in the past has mainly focussed on array performance as the sole objective .",
    "thus , a fair comparison has to take into account that we are trying to achieve both high performance and low cost , as represented by cable length .",
    "our high performance anchor solutions should compare well to solutions achieved by other methods with similar performance metrics .",
    "a good comparison can be made to the configurations done by  @xcite and @xcite .",
    "shown in the third panel of figures  [ 27 ] - [ 160 ] are the high performance arrays .",
    "it can be seen that many of them are circular with inward reaching arms .",
    "the 60-station configurations can be directly related to configurations for uniform @xmath0 distribution done in @xcite .",
    "the reuleaux triangles seen in @xcite do not show up as optimum performance configurations , but rather as nadir - utopia solutions .",
    "this can be attributed to the observation that the @xmath0 plane is not completely filled in figures  [ 27ds ] - [ 160ds ] because the maximum baseline length for a reuleaux triangle is smaller than that of a circle , so the outer most annulus in the @xmath0 is missing .",
    "this could be changed if our maximum radius constraint were not hard bound , allowing the reuleaux triangle s maximum baseline to match that of a circle configuration . in turn",
    ", this would also increase the amount of cable length associated with that configuration .",
    "it is desirable to perform optimization on any design problem with at least two separate methods .",
    "this helps in assessing whether the converged solutions are truly optimal , or non - dominated as in our case , or whether they are merely an artifact of the capabilities of the chosen algorithm .",
    "this section presents array optimization results obtained by simulated annealing ( sa ) . after a brief explanation of the algorithm ,",
    "results with @xmath29 are used as a benchmark and compared against the earlier results obtained by genetic multiobjective optimization .",
    "the fundamental concept of simulated annealing is based on the metropolis algorithm @xcite for simulating the behavior of an ensemble of atoms that are cooled slowly from their melted state to their low energy ground state .",
    "the ground state corresponds to the global optimum we are seeking in topological optimization .",
    "simulated annealing is credited to kirkpatrick , gelatt and vecchi  @xcite and this article closely follows their implementation .    in order to apply simulated annealing to array configurations ,",
    "we must first introduce the notion of `` system energy '' . in order to be consistent with our definition of design objectives in section  [ objectives ] ,",
    "let    @xmath30    be the surrogate for _ energy _ of a particular array .",
    "the metrics @xmath18 and @xmath9 for @xmath0 density and cable length were defined in equation ( [ eq_m ] ) and section  [ cable ] , respectively . @xmath31 and @xmath32 are normalization parameters determined from a randomly generated array population as discussed below . the parameter @xmath33 $ ] can be tuned to emphasize performance ( @xmath34 ) or cable length ( @xmath35 ) in the energy function .      in order to understand the average properties of random arrays we generated 100 arrays , whereby the @xmath10 and @xmath11 coordinates are distributed within a 400 km diameter according to a uniform probability density .",
    "the positions of the random arrays in objective space are plotted in figure  [ saobj ] .",
    "the statistics of the random population are contained in table  [ tab : sa ] .",
    "the normalization parameters are @xmath36 and @xmath37 km , respectively .",
    "we choose the representative from this population , which comes closest to the average @xmath0 density and cable length as the initial configuration , @xmath38 $ ] .",
    "this initial configuration has a cable length of 1087.2 km and a @xmath0 density of 0.6382 .",
    "its position in objective space is depicted in figure  [ saobj ] by a dark square and its topology is represented in figure  [ satop](a ) .",
    "the ultimate goal of simulated annealing is to find the ground state(s ) , i.e. the minimum energy configuration(s ) , with a relatively small amount of computation .",
    "minimum energy states are those that have a high likelihood of existence at low temperature .",
    "the likelihood that a configuration , @xmath39 , is allowed to exist is equal to the boltzmann probability factor @xmath40    whereby we often set @xmath41 for convenience .",
    "one can see that , at the same temperature , @xmath42 , lower energy configurations are more likely to occur than higher energy configurations .",
    "this concept is at the core of simulated annealing .    a block diagram of simulated annealing is provided in figure  [ saflow ] .",
    "the algorithm begins with an initial configuration , @xmath43 and initial temperature @xmath44 .",
    "this configuration can be random or an initial best guess .",
    "the energy of the initial configuration , @xmath45 is evaluated .",
    "next , a perturbed configuration , @xmath46 is created by ( slightly ) modifying the current configuration , @xmath39 . for array optimization a perturbation consists of moving one station to a new , random location .",
    "next , the energy , @xmath47 and energy difference @xmath48 are computed . if @xmath49 , i.e. the new perturbed configuration is automatically accepted as the new configuration . if , on the other hand , @xmath50 , we generate a uniformly distributed random number @xmath51 $ ] and compare it with the boltzmann probability @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "if @xmath53 is smaller than @xmath54 the perturbed solution is accepted even though it is `` worse '' , otherwise the unperturbed configuration , @xmath39 , remains as the current configuration .",
    "next , we check whether or not thermal equilibrium has been reached at temperature @xmath55 .",
    "if thermal equilibrium has not been reached we go on creating and evaluating perturbed configurations at the same temperature .",
    "if thermal equilibrium has been reached , i.e. when @xmath56 configuration changes have been accepted at @xmath55 , we reduce the system temperature by some increment @xmath57 and start creating and evaluating configurations at the new , lower temperature @xmath58 .",
    "the algorithm terminates , once the system appears `` frozen '' , i.e. when no new configurations have been accepted in a large number of attempts .",
    "there is no guarantee that the last configuration is the best , such that one usually keeps in memory the lowest energy configuration encountered during _ simulated annealing_.      we now present two different results obtained with simulated annealing .",
    "first , we optimized the array , setting the energy tuning parameter to @xmath59 .",
    "this means that we seek maximum performance ( @xmath18 as small as possible ) , regardless of cable length . the convergence history for this case is shown in figure  [ saconverge ] .",
    "the energy of the initial configuration is @xmath60 .",
    "this is gradually reduced to @xmath61 for the performance - optimal array .",
    "it is interesting to see that simulated annealing initially behaves similarly to random search ( up until iteration @xmath62 ) and transitions to behave more like gradient search as system temperature is lowered .",
    "the best configuration found by simulated annealing with @xmath59 is shown in figure  [ satop](b ) .",
    "the position of this array in the objective space ( figure  [ saobj ] ) with a @xmath0 density of 0.329 and cable length of 1451 km is close , but slightly offset from the pareto front computed by the genetic algorithm .",
    "it is noteworthy that the earlier hypothesis that performance - optimal arrays are `` circles with inward reaching arms '' is confirmed by simulated annealing .",
    "an analysis of sa internal parameters shows that , as temperature decreases exponentially , entropy also drops sharply towards the end of the annealing process . since entropy is the natural logarithm of the number of unique configurations in the ensemble at a given temperature step @xmath55",
    ", we conclude that simulated annealing is able to reduce entropy , therefore transforming a random initial array with a high degree of disorder to an ordered ( more geometrical ) array with lower entropy .",
    "this important point will be discussed again in section  [ conclusions ] .    what about the case where we want to balance @xmath0 density and cable cost of an array ?",
    "we set @xmath63 and start annealing the initial configuration , @xmath43 , anew .",
    "the frozen configuration in this case can be seen in figure  [ satop](c ) , its apparent position in the objective space is shown in figure  [ saobj ] . the cable length of configuration @xmath64 is 691.7 km , while its @xmath0 density is 0.618 .",
    "this topology is clearly reminiscent of the `` y '' configurations used in the vla and those that were provided as seed solutions in figure [ init_seed ] ( upper left ) .",
    "this again , confirms the types of topologies found by the genetic algorithm in the short - cable - length regime .",
    "we conclude that simulated annealing did not find better or significantly different arrays than the genetic algorithm and that this second method therefore corroborates the results discussed earlier in section  [ results ] .",
    "this is at least true for the values of @xmath65 that were analyzed .",
    "further tests were conducted and did not change this result .",
    "we attribute the fact that the solutions obtained by simulated annealing do not lie exactly on the pareto front to the reduced computational effort ( 0.2 hours per run ) , compared to the genetic optimizations ( table  [ simpar ] ) .",
    "annealing could be repeated with a slower cooling schedule and more stringent `` freezing '' criteria , which would produce arrays closer to the pareto front .",
    "this , however , would be of little value as further runs with simulated annealing are not likely to change the conclusions of this section .",
    "the objective spaces presented above show a wide range of pareto optimal designs . in all cases a concave pareto front developed with decreasing marginal returns as designs improved in either metric .",
    "this leaves the choice up to designers for the type of array that can be afforded .",
    "if cable length is not an issue in the array design , then ring - like solutions with inward reaching arms are a good choice .",
    "if cable length is a major issue , then slightly randomized vla - like configurations may be the best choice .",
    "if a trade - off is desired , the reuleaux triangle configurations , or other hybrid designs near the nadir - utopia point may be chosen . as more objectives",
    "are added to the multiobjective design problem , different pareto surfaces may give new tradeoffs between objectives , particularly if the array should be grown over time .",
    "as the number of stations increased , pareto optimal solutions were more and more like the initial seeds of the population . why is this the case ?",
    "the number of @xmath0 points in the @xmath0 plane is increasing for a fixed @xmath0 plane size .",
    "in essence , the density of the @xmath0 plane is increasing .",
    "as the @xmath0 density increases , the gaps in the @xmath0 plane become smaller . smaller gap sizes , along with the large number of @xmath0 points makes it difficult for small perturbations from the highly geometric designs to make a large difference in the array performance metric .",
    "this creates a diminishing return on increasing the number of stations to fill the same @xmath0 space .",
    "the highly geometric designs , which have very good cable length qualities , produce very similar results to designs that have small random perturbations and longer cable lengths . in the 27-station case",
    ", there were large gaps in the @xmath0 plane , thus small perturbations and hybridization aided in improving designs with respect to both metrics .",
    "this result suggests that a cost trade - off may exist between adding more stations to a highly geometric design , and moving around a fixed number of stations to create a better @xmath0 coverage , a trade - off not considered in the work we have done to date .",
    "there are other possible considerations as well , such as surface brightness sensitivity and the computational power required to combine more signals from more baselines .",
    "new objectives need to be introduced to take these important considerations into account",
    ".      an interesting feature of our objective space is that for arrays with a large number of stations well - known highly geometric configurations are optimum and occupy particular regions on or near the pareto front .",
    "there is a progression as we go from @xmath1-configurations , to triangles and reuleaux triangles , to circles along the pareto front . for the smaller number of stations we found optimum solutions that are significantly better than the initial seeds . for the larger number of stations we were able to improve the array performance , but we did not find any designs that simultaneously improved array performance and shortened cable length ; i.e. , we could not advance the pareto front",
    ". it should be noted , however , that these conclusions are specific to the two metrics and size constraints we considered . introducing new design objectives and relaxing the size constraints may shift the optimum designs away from geometric arrays .    in our simulations , configurations improved throughout the optimization runs , but kept the general shape of the initial seeds .",
    "perturbations from ideal geometries and reduction in unnecessary components of the initial seeds were sufficient to improve the designs .",
    "why were there no new topologies found ?",
    "the initial seeds into the population are highly geometric .",
    "highly geometric arrays have smooth pathways for cable configurations to follow , thus already having quite a low cable length compared to very similar designs that have random perturbations from the ideal geometries and similar array performance .",
    "we discovered the fundamental role that entropy ( the degree of randomness ) plays in array optimization and how genetic algorithms and simulated annealing cope with it in different ways .",
    "the strength of genetic algorithms is to maintain a diverse population of designs , while continuously advancing the best approximation of the pareto front .",
    "genetic algorithms are handicapped , however , when it comes to reducing entropy in its population of arrays .",
    "it is easy for genetic algorithms to go from highly geometric shapes to more non - geometric shapes , but statistically it is difficult to create highly geometric shapes from more non - geometric shapes during crossover and mutation of station configurations .",
    "figure [ 60randds ] shows the objective space for a 60-station simulation that was run with only non - geometric initial seeds .",
    "as can be seen from the figure , the non - geometric initial seeds start significantly off the pareto front ; just as in the case of simulated annealing .",
    "figure [ randomvsgeometric ] shows the difference between the pareto fronts for the 60-station simulation run with geometric initial seeds vs the 60-station simulation run with non - geometric initial seeds .",
    "as can be seen , both converge to the best trade - off and high performance solutions similarly .",
    "as one moves along the pareto front to the highly geometric designs ( up and to the left ) the non - geometric initial seed simulation did not populate that area in the pareto front .",
    "this supports the entropy argument that it is difficult to produce highly geometric seeds from non - geometric ones with genetic algorithms .",
    "the initial seeds into the genetic population are therefore important , since by infusing geometrical solutions and enforcing some degree of elitism the entropy of the overall population can be kept low , while at the same time exploring beneficial randomization .",
    "the @xmath1-configuration is probably that which gives the smallest cable length while spanning a two - dimensional flat surface of a given size .",
    "including a @xmath1-configuration as one of the initial seeds ensures that the upper left part of the design space is sampled .",
    "highly nonlinear objective spaces , such as this one , also pose the problem that if one good array configuration swaps station placement information with another good array configuration , the resulting array is not necessarily going to be an improvement , but more than likely it will be less optimal if the arrays are very different from each other .",
    "simulated annealing , on the other hand , is very apt at reducing entropy by its very nature .",
    "geometrical array configurations , such as the minimum - cable - length `` y ' 's , can be found by simulated annealing , see figure  [ satop](c ) , starting from random starting points and manual seed solutions are not required .",
    "the problem , however , is that in order to explore the entire multiobjective space with simulated annealing , the parameter @xmath65 must be tuned in many small increments and a separate optimization must be run for each setting .",
    "even a uniform sweep of such tuning parameters can not guarantee that a good approximation of the pareto front can always be found . also , it is not clear that simulated annealing would be computationally less expensive than the genetic framework once slower cooling schedules and more conservative freezing criteria are introduced .",
    "this is not to suggest that the genetic framework is perfect as it stands . perhaps further improvement can come from implementing different genetic algorithm techniques .",
    "an example is selective mating , a modification to the mating algorithm which restricts designs which are too dissimilar from exchanging information .",
    "also , there is current research in the optimization community trying to combine the best features of genetic algorithms and simulated annealing in a new class of hybrid algorithms .",
    "we have developed a framework for optimization of antenna arrays that can be used to address a number of interesting issues in array design .",
    "there are many considerations in the design of antenna arrays that we have not yet addressed .",
    "the issue of site constraints is one interesting concept that most ground based arrays will face .",
    "as array designs come to fruition , they must ultimately deal with the terrain upon which they will be built .",
    "using site masks to eliminate areas where stations can be placed will put a new constraint upon the design .",
    "conversely , removing size constraints , such as the maximum diameter discussed in section  [ parameters ] , and optimizing may yield interesting results , e.g. increasing the reuleaux triangle s size will increase its radius of curvature , increasing its longest baselines to compete with those of a circular configuration , while still performing trade offs between performance and cost . in another area , it is of course the case that different scientific goals require different @xmath0 distributions . our ability to modify the nominal distribution of points in the @xmath0 plane will allow us to address a variety of scientific goals .",
    "there is also the issue of phased deployment of arrays @xcite .",
    "many arrays are not built all at once and then just turned on , rather they are phased into existence .",
    "a phased deployment may allow particular scientific questions to be addressed early and may lead to an array that is more extensible over time .",
    "however , this requirement would significantly affect array design .",
    "array robustness is also an issue of larger arrays .",
    "some stations may be more critical than others , and repair schedules may become difficult if many stations are disabled at once .",
    "analysis of critical components and failure modes of the array can be useful in improving the efficiency of array configurations .",
    "array optimization will continue to be an important tool in the planning and construction of future radio telescopes .",
    "the framework we have developed will allow issues , such as the ones described above , to be addressed in an objective way .",
