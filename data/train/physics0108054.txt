    "dna sequences are of fundamental importance in understanding living organisms , since all information on their hereditary evolution is contained in these macromolecules . one of the challenges of dna sequence analysis is to determine the patterns of these sequences .",
    "it is useful to distinguish coding from noncoding sequences .",
    "problems related to the classification and evolution of organisms using dna sequences are also important .",
    "fractal analysis has proved useful in revealing complex patterns in natural objects .",
    "@xcite considered the global fractal dimension of human dna sequences treated as pseudorandom walks .",
    "vieira @xcite carried out a low - frequency analysis of the complete dna of 13 microbial genomes and showed that their fractal behaviour does not always prevail through the entire chain and the autocorrelation functions have a rich variety of behaviours including the presence of anti - persistence .",
    "provata and almirantis @xcite proposed a fractal cantor pattern of dna .",
    "they mapped coding segments to filled regions and noncoding segments to empty regions of a random cantor set and then calculated the fractal dimension of this set .",
    "they found that the coding / noncoding partition in dna sequences of lower organisms is homogeneous - like , while in the higher eucariotes the partition is fractal .",
    "yu and anh @xcite proposed a time series model based on the global structure of the complete genome and found that one can get more information from this model than that of fractal cantor pattern . some results on the classification and evolution relationship of bacteria were found in @xcite .",
    "the correlation property of length sequences was discussed in @xcite .",
    "although statistical analysis performed directly on dna sequences has yielded some success , there has been some indication that this method is not powerful enough to amplify the difference between a dna sequence and a random sequence as well as to distinguish dna sequences themselves in more details .",
    "one needs more powerful global and visual methods . for this purpose , hao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite proposed a visualisation method based on coarse - graining and counting of the frequency of appearance and strings of a given length .",
    "they called it the _ portrait _ of an organism .",
    "they found that there exist some fractal patterns in the portraits which are induced by avoiding and under - represented strings .",
    "the fractal dimension of the limit set of portraits was discussed in @xcite .",
    "there are other graphical methods of sequence patterns , such as chaos game representation ( see @xcite ) .    in the portrait representation , hao _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used squares to represent substrings and discrete colour grades to represent the frequencies of the substrings in the complete genome .",
    "it is difficult to know the accurate value of the frequencies of the substrings from the portrait representation .",
    "and they did not discuss the classification and evolution problem . in order to improve it , yu _",
    "@xcite used subintervals in one - dimensional space to represent substrings to obtain an accurate histogram of the substrings in the complete genome .",
    "the histogram , viewed as a probability measure and was called the _ measure representation _ of the complete genome , gives a precise compression of the genome .",
    "multifractal analysis was then proposed in yu _",
    "et al _ @xcite to treat the classification and evolution problem based on the measure representation of different organisms .",
    "in this paper , we go one step further and provide a complete characterisation of the dna sequences based on their measure representation .",
    "this is given in the form of the probability density function of the measure .",
    "we first show that the given measure is in fact a multiplicative cascade generated by an infinitely divisible distribution .",
    "this probability distribution is uniquely determined by the exponent @xmath0 @xmath1 in the multifractal analysis of the cascade .",
    "this theory will be detailed in the next section .",
    "we then apply the theory on a large number of typical genomes .",
    "it will be seen that the gamma density function provides an excellent fit to the @xmath2 curve of each genome .",
    "this characterisation therefore provides a needed tool to study the evolution of organisms .",
    "we first outline the method of yu _ et al _ @xcite in deriving the measure representation of a dna sequence .",
    "such a sequence is formed by four different nucleotides , namely adenine ( @xmath3 ) , cytosine ( _ c ) _ , guanine ( _ g ) _ and thymine ( _ t ) .",
    "_ we call any string made of @xmath4 letters from the set @xmath5 a @xmath4-string . for a given @xmath4 there are in total @xmath6 different @xmath4-strings . in order to count the number of each kind of @xmath7-strings in a given dna sequence , @xmath6 counters are needed .",
    "we divide the interval @xmath8 into @xmath6 disjoint subintervals , and use each subinterval to represent a counter . letting @xmath9 be a substring with length @xmath4 , we define @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 we then use the subinterval @xmath13 to represent substring @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath15 be the times of substring @xmath14 appearing in the complete genome .",
    "if the number of bases in the complete genome is @xmath16 , we define @xmath17 to be the frequency of substring @xmath14 .",
    "it follows that @xmath18 .",
    "now we can define a measure @xmath19 on @xmath20 by @xmath21 where @xmath22 we then have @xmath23 and @xmath24 we call @xmath25 the _  measure representation _ of an organism . as an example , the measure representation of _",
    "m. genitalium _ for @xmath26 is given in figure 1 .",
    "self - similarity is apparent in the measures .",
    "more than 33 bacterial complete genomes are now available in public databases .",
    "there are six archaebacteria ( _ archaeoglobus fulgidus _ , _ pyrococcus abyssi _ , _ methanococcus jannaschii _ , _ pyrococcus horikoshii _ , _ aeropyrum pernix _ and _ methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum )",

    "pcc6803 ) _ ; and thirteen proteobacteria .",
    "the thirteen proteobacteria are divided into four subdivisions , which are alpha subdivision ( _ rhizobium sp . ngr234 _ and _ rickettsia prowazekii ) _ ; gamma subdivision ( _ escherichia coli _ , _ haemophilus influenzae _ , _ xylella fastidiosa _ , _ vibrio cholerae _ , _ pseudomonas aeruginosa _ and _ buchnera sp .",

    "we find that the @xmath27 curves are very close to one another for @xmath28 for each organism .",
    "hence it would be appropriate to take @xmath29 if we want to use the @xmath27 curves to discuss the classification and evolution problem .",
    "it is still needed to know what is the analytical expression of the dimension spectra .",

    "in fact , the ergodic theorem now takes the following form @xmath154",
    "for @xmath29 , we first calculated @xmath155 of the measure representation of all the above organisms directly from the definition of @xmath155 ( [ 2.23 ] ) .",

    "if all chromosomes for each higher organism are considered , the data fitting for @xmath156 will be better .",
    "the fit for human chromosome is the worst in table 1 .",
    "since the length of human chromosome 22 is not larger than those of the complete genomes of all bacteria , there does not seem to be any relationship between the quality of fit and the length of the complete genome .",
    "the parameter @xmath166 provides a tool to classify bacteria . from table 1 ,",
    "one can see _ helicobacter pylori 26695 _ and _ helicobacter pylori j99 _ group together , and three chlamydia almost group together .",
    "but this parameter @xmath166 alone is not sufficient , it must be combined with other tools to classify bacteria .",
    "we also calculated the values of @xmath167 using its definition ( [ 2.25 ] ) .",
    "we found the values of @xmath157 coincide with those obtained from ( [ 2.28 ] ) .",

    "an analytical expressions for @xmath168 can therefore be obtained from ( [ 2.28 ] ) and @xmath27 from ( [ 2.25a ] ) .",
    "the idea of our measure representation is similar to the portrait method proposed by hao _ _ et al.__@xcite .",
    "it provides a simple yet powerful visualisation method to amplify the difference between a dna sequence and a random sequence as well as to distinguish dna sequences themselves in more details . from our measure representation",
    "we can exactly know the frequencies of all the @xmath4-string appearing in the complete genome .",
    "but the representations alone are not sufficient to discuss the classification and evolution problem .",
    "hence we need further tools .    in our previous work ( yu _ et al _ @xcite ) , when the measure representations of organisms were viewed as time series , it was found that they are far from being random time series , and in fact exhibit strong long - range dependence .",
    "multifractal analysis of the complete genomes was performed in relation to the problem of classification and evolution of organisms . in this paper , we established a theoretical model of the probability distribution of the complete genomes .",
    "this probability distribution , particularly the resulting @xmath155 curve , provides a precise tool for their characterisation .",
