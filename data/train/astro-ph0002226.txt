    "the importance of low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies in the local universe has recently been emphasized in a study by oneil & bothun ( 2000 ) which has extended the known distribution of galaxies in the local universe .",
    "their result is a flat surface brightness distribution function from the freeman value of 21.65 @xmath1 0.30 to the survey limit of 25.0 b mag arcsec@xmath0 , more than 10@xmath2 away ( figure  [ fig : sbdist]a ) .",
    "this indicates that the majority of the galaxies , and potentially the majority of the baryons in the local universe , are contained in gravitational potentials only dimly lit by the embedded galaxy . realizing that most galaxies are optically diffuse , then",
    ", it becomes extremely important to understand these systems if we wish to understand galaxy formation and evolution as a whole . with this in mind",
    "i wish to undertake a brief review both of our current understanding of lsb galaxy properties as well as a review of some popular ideas behind the formation of these enigmatic systems .    0.1 in    -0.1 in",
    "* lsb galaxy colors : * contrary to what was first believed , the colors of lsb galaxies range across the entire high surface brightness ( hsb ) galaxy spectrum , including what may be the bluest galaxy known ( ugc 12695 , with @xmath3 ) as well has some fairly red systems ( @xmath4 ) ( figure  [ fig : sbdist]b ) ( oneil , _ et.al .",
    "_  1997a , 1997b , 1998 ) .",
    "although currently it appears that lsb galaxy colors do not quite extend into the extremely red colors found in some hsb galaxies , this is likely due more to small number statistics rather than to an actual lack of extremely red lsb systems .",
    "* gas - to - luminosity ratio of lsb galaxies : * the gas - to - luminosity ratio ( m@xmath5/l@xmath6 ) of lsb galaxies spans an extremely large range , from fairly low ( m@xmath5/l@xmath6 = 0.1 @xmath7  ) through what may be the highest m@xmath5/l@xmath6 galaxies known ( [ obc97 ] n9 - 2 , m@xmath5/l@xmath6 = 46 @xmath7  ) . additionally , if any trend can be seen between the galaxies color and gas content it is that there may be an _ increase _ in their m@xmath5/l@xmath6 with redder color ( figure  [ fig : gascol]a ) ( oneil , bothun , & schombert 2000 , obs from now on ) .    *",
    "tully - fisher relation : * although previous studies have shown lsb galaxies to follow a slightly broadened version of the standard tully - fisher ( t - f ) relation defined by hsb galaxies ( zwaan , _ et.al . _  1995 ) , a recent study of over 40 lsb galaxies found no significant correlation between lsb galaxy velocity widths and absolute magnitudes , with only 40% of the sample falling within 1@xmath2 of the previously defined lsb t - f relation ( figure  [ fig : gascol]b ) . at the least , then , there is a significant population of lsb galaxies which do not adhere to the t - f relation ( obs ) .",
    "* rotation curves : * the rotation curves of lsb galaxies have been shown to rise more slowly than similar hsb galaxies using ` standard ' values for the stellar mass - to - luminosity ratio , as taken from hsb galaxies ( @xmath8 = 1  3 ) , this leads to the conclusion that many lsb galaxies have a baryonic mass fraction up to 3@xmath9 less than hsb galaxies with the same velocity width ( i.e. swaters , _ et.al .",
    "_  2000 ; van zee , _ et.al . _  1998 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .    0.7 in    0.1 in    -0.1 in",
    "* the faded version of hsb galaxies ? * no .",
    "lsb galaxies often have both very blue colors and very low metallicities ( @xmath10 @xmath11 0.2 , z @xmath11 0.01@xmath12  ) , precluding the possibility that lsb galaxies are primarily composed of an old stellar population . as a caveat ,",
    "though , it should be noted that a number of very red lsb galaxies have now been found , and these could be faded hsb galaxies .",
    "if this is correct , though , all other lsb galaxies ( i.e. those which do not have extremely red colors ) would have to be explained , as well as why there are two separate populations of lsb galaxies ( oneil , _ et.al .",
    "_  1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "* `` stretched out ''",
    "hsb galaxies ? * no .",
    "current theories describing lsb galaxies as extending further into their dark matter haloes than similar hsb galaxies predict that lsb galaxies will follow either a universal t - f relation or one which is unique at each @xmath13(0 ) .",
    "these theories therefore can not account for the galaxies of obs which fall well off the t - f relation , with no correlation between @xmath13(0 )  and residual error .",
    "additional problems with the models can ( depending on which models are considered ) include : difficulty matching the observed shape of lsb galaxy rotation curves ; inability to allow for high gas fraction , red lsb galaxies , ( i.e. dalcanton , _ et.al . _  1997 ; mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ; avila - reese & firmani 2000 ; mcgaugh 1999 ) .    * a completely new type of galaxy ? * no .",
    "although this idea could justify ignoring lsb galaxies when determining theories of galaxy formation and evolution , no evidence has been seen for lsb galaxies to be anything but a continuation of the hsb galaxy spectrum .",
    "there is a smooth transition between lsb and hsb galaxies in surface brightness and complete overlap in lsb and hsb galaxy colors , scale lengths , mass , luminosity , etc .",
    "( i.e. bell & de blok 2000 ; oneil , _",
    "_  1997a , 1997b ) .",
    "* galaxies with a different stellar population ?",
    "although this is not a popular idea , as having an imf which depends on galaxy properties ( i.e. surface density ) adds complication to models of galaxy evolution , this theory has not yet been disproved .",
    "the gas density of lsb galaxies is typically at or below the nominal threshold for star formation , as set by the toomre criterion ( i.e. van zee , _ et.al . _  1998 ; de blok , mcgaugh , & van der hulst 1996 ) . with this in mind",
    ", it would be suprising if lsb galaxies imf was not at least somewhat affected by their low density .",
    "additionally , recent hst wfpc-2 studies of three nearby lsb de galaxies failed to find evidence for a significant number of red giants ( @xmath11 13 per 10 pc@xmath14 , as opposed to the 100s per 10 pc@xmath14 typically found in hsb galaxies ( oneil , _ et.al . _  1999 ) ) . using these two ideas  the low gas density and the lack of evidence for significant numbers of giant branch stars  we can construct a toy model wherein no stars greater than 2@xmath15  are allowed to form .",
    "when this is done , not only are lsb galaxy colors , gas fractions , etc . readily matched , but it is also remarkably easy to form both red and blue galaxies which do not follow the canonical t - f relation ( see obs ) .",
    "additionally , the addition of a large number of small stars to any galaxy dramatically increases the galaxy s stellar mass - to - luminosity ratio ( @xmath8 ) and can dramatically decrease the total amount of dark matter needed in lsb systems ( swaters , _ et.al .",
    "_  2000 ; obs ) .",
    "although these models are admittedly extremely oversimplified , they pave the way for further studies into this idea , and currently appear to be the best theory going .",
