    "quantum computers @xcite are information processing devices that use quantum mechanical effects to implement algorithms which are not accessible to classical computers , and thus to tackle otherwise intractable problems @xcite .",
    "quantum computers are extremely vulnerable to the effects of errors , and considerable effort has been expended on alleviating the effects of random errors arising from decoherence processes @xcite .",
    "it is , however , also important to consider the effects of systematic errors , which arise from reproducible imperfections in the apparatus used to implement quantum computations .",
    "the effects of systematic errors are clearly visible in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments @xcite which have been used to implement small quantum computers @xcite . implementing complex quantum algorithms require a network of many quantum logic gates , which for an nmr implementation translates into even longer cascades of pulses . in these cases",
    "small systematic errors in the pulses ( which can be ignored in many conventional nmr experiments ) accumulate and have significant effects .",
    "it makes sense to consider systematic errors as some of them can be tackled relatively easily . in the bloch picture , where unitary operations are visualized as rotations of the bloch vector on the unit sphere ,",
    "systematic errors are expressed as rotational imperfections .",
    "the sensitivity of the final state to these imperfections can be much reduced by replacing single rotations with composed rotations as discussed below .",
    "any implementation of a quantum computer requires quantum bits ( qubits ) on which the quantum information is stored , and quantum logic gates which act on the qubits to process the quantum information .",
    "fortunately it is only necessary to implement a small set of quantum logic gates , as more complex operations can be achieved by joining these gates together to form logic circuits .",
    "a simple and convenient set comprises a range of single qubit gates together with one or more two qubit gates , which implement conditional evolutions and thus logical operations @xcite .",
    "nmr quantum computers are implemented @xcite using the two spin states of spin-1/2 atomic nuclei in a magnetic field as the qubits .",
    "transitions between these states , and thus single qubit gates , are achieved by the application of radio frequency ( rf ) pulses .",
    "two qubit gates require some sort of spin  spin interaction , which in nmr is provided by the scalar spin ",
    "spin coupling ( @xmath0 coupling ) interaction . while this does not have quite the form needed for standard two qubit gates , it can be easily sculpted into the desired form by combining free evolution under the background hamiltonian ( which includes spin  spin coupling terms ) with the application of single qubit gates @xcite .    as single qubit gates involve the application of external fields they are vulnerable to systematic errors in these fields . in the ideal case",
    ", the application of a rf field in resonance with the corresponding transition with relative phase @xmath1 ( in the rotating frame @xcite ) will drive the bloch vector through some angle about an axis orthogonal to the @xmath2-axis and at an angle @xmath1 to the @xmath3-axis .",
    "the rotation angle , @xmath4 , depends on the nutation rate induced by the rf field , usually written @xmath5 , and the duration of the pulse , @xmath6 . in practice",
    "the rf field is not ideal , and this leads to two important types of systematic errors , pulse length errors and off - resonance effects @xcite .",
    "pulse length errors occur when the duration of the rf pulse is set incorrectly , or ( equivalently ) when the rf field strength deviates from its nominal value , so that the rotation angle achieved deviates from its theoretical value . within nmr",
    "this effect is most commonly observed as a result of spatial inhomogeneity in the applied rf field , so that it is impossible for all the spins within a macroscopic sample to experience the same rotation angle .",
    "off - resonance effects arise when the rf field is not quite in resonance with the relevant transition , so that the rotation occurs around some tilted axis .",
    "composite pulses @xcite are widely used in nmr to minimize the sensitivity of the system to these errors by replacing simple rotations with composite rotations which are less susceptible to such effects . however , conventional composite pulse sequences are rarely appropriate for quantum computation because they usually incorporate assumptions about the initial state of the spins .",
    "such starting states are not known for pulses in the middle of complex quantum computations , and it is therefore necessary to use fully - compensating ( type a ) composite pulse sequences @xcite , which work for any initial state .",
    "composite pulses of this kind , which do not offer quite the same degree of compensation as is found with more conventional sequences , are of little use in conventional nmr , and have received relatively little study .",
    "they are , however , ideally suited to quantum computation .",
    "the problem of tackling off - resonance errors was initially studied by tycko @xcite ; his results were then extended by cummins and jones @xcite . here",
    "we describe two families of composite pulses which can be used to compensate for off - resonance errors , and show how they can be derived using quaternions .",
    "the original method used to develop many type a composite pulse sequences @xcite was based on dividing the propagator describing the evolution of the quantum system into intended and error components , and then seeking to minimise the error term . while this approach is effective , it is cumbersome , and a much simpler approach can be adopted for single qubit gates , which are simply rotations on the bloch sphere and so can be modelled by quaternions .",
    "the quaternions corresponding to individual pulses can be multiplied together to give a quaternion description of the composite pulse , which can then be compared with the quaternion of the ideal system .    a quaternion is often thought of as a vector with four coefficients , but when describing a rotation it is more useful to regroup these coefficients as a scalar and a three - vector , @xmath7 where @xmath8 depends solely on the rotation angle , @xmath4 , and @xmath9 depends on both the rotation angle , @xmath4 , and a unit vector along the rotation axis , @xmath10 .",
    "thus the quaternion describing an on - resonance pulse with phase angle @xmath1 is @xmath11 an off - resonance pulse is conveniently parameterised by its off - resonance fraction @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 is the off - resonance frequency , and @xmath5 the nutation rate ) , and is described by the quaternion @xmath14 where @xmath15 , and @xmath4 is now the nominal rotation angle , that is the rotation achieved when @xmath16 .",
    "the quaternion describing a sequence of pulses is obtained by multiplying the quaternions for each pulse according to the rule @xmath17 finally , two quaternions can be compared using the quaternion fidelity @xcite @xmath18 ( it is necessary to take the absolute value , as the two quaternions @xmath19 and @xmath20 correspond to equivalent rotations , differing in their rotation angle by integer multiples of @xmath21 ) .",
    "following our previous work @xcite we seek to tackle off - resonance errors in a @xmath22 pulse using a sequence of three pulses applied along the @xmath3 , @xmath23 and @xmath3 axes ; pulses with any other phase angle can then be trivially derived by simply adding the desired value to the phase angles of all the pulses in the sequence .",
    "such sequences can be described completely by the nominal rotation angles of the three pulses , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the composite quaternion for this composite pulse is complicated , but the situation can be greatly simplified by expanding it as a maclaurin series in @xmath27 and neglecting all terms above the first power .",
    "this gives @xmath28 and @xmath29 while the ideal quaternion has the form @xmath30 it now remains to chose the three nominal rotation angles so that these equations agree .",
    "first we note that in order to achieve the correct rotation angle , @xmath31 , we must choose our angles such that @xmath32 ( where @xmath33 is any integer ) .",
    "we also note that the @xmath34 component of @xmath35 should equal zero , and that this can be achieved by choosing @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 is any integer ) .",
    "these two choices give @xmath38 finally we choose @xmath24 such that the @xmath2 component of @xmath35 equals zero ; this gives @xmath39 combining this value with our previous relations between the angles gives @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are integers , subject to the physical restriction that the resulting pulse angles must be positive .",
    "these solutions have the same general form as those found previously @xcite .",
    "although they appear to differ in detail the expressions are , in fact , identical : taking the values @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 gives our previous family of solutions @xcite , referred to by the acronym corpse ( compensation for off - resonance with a pulse sequence ) .",
    "this family is now seen to be just one member of a larger group of families . to choose between these it is necessary to look at higher order terms , and",
    "this is most conveniently achieved using the quaternion fidelity , equation  [ eq : fidelity ] . as a baseline",
    "we take the fidelity of a single off - resonance @xmath47 pulse compared with its ( ideal ) on - resonance form , @xmath48 where terms in @xmath49 and higher have been neglected .",
    "note that the fidelity only contains even order terms in @xmath27 as the composite pulse perform symmetrically for positive and negative values of @xmath27 .",
    "as expected all members of our general group of solutions result in much better fidelities ; in particular the term in @xmath50 is always completely removed .",
    "the behaviour of the term in @xmath49 is much more complicated , but it can be shown that this term depends _ only _ on the value of @xmath51 , that is the total number of _ additional _ @xmath21 rotations performed by the composite pulse sequence , and has the smallest absolute value when the three integers are chosen so that @xmath52 . as our previous values ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) are the smallest numbers that fit this criterion , it seems that the corpse family of pulse sequences is indeed the best member of this group .",
    "the only other family of interest is that with @xmath53 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , previously referred to as short - corpse @xcite ; while this performs less well than corpse it is somewhat shorter .",
    "numerical values of individual pulse rotation angles for corpse sequences with a variety of target angles are given in table  [ tab : corpse ] .",
    ".pulse rotation angles for a corpse composite pulse with a target rotation of @xmath22 ; corpse pulse phases are @xmath54 , @xmath23 , @xmath54 . [ cols=\">,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     the performance of the bb1 and plain @xmath55 pulses are compared in figure  [ fig : bb1 ] .     for pulses with a target rotation angle of @xmath55 .",
    "]    for all target angles below @xmath55 the bb1 composite pulse outperforms a simple pulse when @xmath56 .",
    "another simple variation is to use two or more error correcting sequences ; as before these can be placed at various different points around or within the @xmath22 pulse . for simplicity",
    "we assume that all the error correcting sequences are identical to one another , and have the same general form as w1 . in this case",
    "it can be shown that the correction sequences , which we call wn , have phase angles given by @xmath57 and @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the total number of sequences used .",
    "as before the fidelity is independent of where the wn sequences are placed , but it does depend on the value of @xmath59 .",
    "the second and fourth order error terms are cancelled in all cases , and the size of the sixth order error term now depends on both @xmath4 and @xmath59 .",
    "the smallest sixth order term is achieved when @xmath60 , but the term is not completely removed .",
    "the gain over @xmath61 is fairly small , and in practice the simpler composite pulses based on the w1 sequence are likely to be the most effective .",
    "having varied the position and number of the error correcting pulse sequences the next logical step is to vary their form . in principle",
    "any sequence that has no overall effect in the absence of errors could be used . in practice",
    "we find that many possible sequences allow the second order error term in the fidelity expression to be removed , but the simultaneous cancellation of second and fourth order errors seems to be a special feature of the wn family of sequences .",
    "given the success of this approach to tackling pulse length errors , it seems obvious to apply the method to tackle off - resonance effects .",
    "as yet , however , this approach has had no success .",
    "so far we have only considered the case of _ either _ off - resonance effects _ or _ pulse length errors being present . in reality both problems may well occur simultaneously .",
    "it is therefore important to consider how such simultaneous errors might be tackled .",
    "ideally we would like to design pulse sequences which can compensate for both problems at the same time ; this , however , is a complicated and as yet unresolved problem , and here we simply analyse the sensitivity of each of our pulse sequences to the _ other _ kind of error .",
    "we proceed as before , calculating composite pulse and simple pulse quaternions in the presence of errors , and determining the quaternion fidelity .",
    "this fidelity can then be expanded as a maclaurin series in the error , and the lower order terms examined .",
    "note that this procedure still assumes that only one type of error is present at a time ; in order to detail with the case where both errors are present _ simultaneously _ it would be possible to use a maclaurin expansion in both errors , but this is unlikely to lead to much insight .",
    "instead we will simply plot the fidelity as function of both errors for some chosen target angle .",
    "we begin by considering the response of the corpse pulse sequence to pulse length errors . in the absence of off - resonance effects",
    "the behaviour of corpse is trivial to calculate , as the three pulses are applied along the @xmath54 , @xmath23 and @xmath54 axes , so that the behaviour is identical to that of a simple pulse .",
    "the behaviour of a @xmath55 pulse in the presence of simultaneous errors is shown in figure  [ fig:2dplots ] .",
    "the behaviour of the scrofulous pulse sequence is difficult to calculate for general target rotation angles , due to the dependence of @xmath24 on the @xmath62 function , and so we concentrate on the case of @xmath55 pulses . for this case",
    "the dependence of the fidelity on off - resonance effects is given by @xmath63 , while a simple pulse has a fidelity @xmath64 ( see equation  [ eq : fidfplain ] ) .",
    "in general scrofulous is considerably more sensitive to off - resonance effects than plain pulses .",
    "finally we consider the bb1 family of pulse sequences , taking the time - symmetrised version of bb1 , equation  [ eq : bb1sym ] , as our standard . in this case",
    "we can solve the problem for any target rotation angle , and up to second order the result is identical to that of a plain pulse , equation  [ eq : fidfplain ] .",
    "thus , unlike scrofulous , the bb1 sequence achieves its impressive tolerance to pulse length errors at little or no cost in sensitivity to off - resonance effects .",
    "this is confirmed for simultaneous errors by figure  [ fig:2dplots ] .",
    "composite pulses show great promise for reducing data errors in nmr quantum computers .",
    "more generally , any implementation of a quantum computer must be concerned on some level with rotations on the bloch sphere , and so composite pulse techniques may find very broad application in quantum computing .",
    "composite pulses are not , however , a panacea , and some caution must be exercised in their use .",
    "the corpse pulse sequence appears to be the best approach for tackling small off - resonance errors ( for large _ known _ off - resonance effects the resonance offset tailored , or rotten , scheme @xcite is preferable ) . for pulse length errors variations on the bb1 scheme of wimperis",
    "@xcite give the best results ; the scrofulous family of pulses is less effective , but does have the advantage of being considerably shorter ."
