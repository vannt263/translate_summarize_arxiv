    "qcd is believed the right theory describing strong interactions , quark model is proved successful in describing normal hadron . however , the low energy behavior of qcd and the mechanism of quark confinement of hadron are not clear .",
    "the study of hadron properties with qcd is a great challenge . in history",
    ", many models based on qcd were developed to study hadron .",
    "qcd ( svz ) sum rule  @xcite is such an effective nonperturbative method of relating fundamental parameters of qcd lagrangian and vacuum to parameters of hadrons .    in sum rules method , to detect the properties of hadrons , some correlators are constructed from suitable interpolating currents ( local operators ) . in one hand , the correlator is expanded in perturbative coefficients and condensates . in the other hand , the imaginary part of the correlator ( spectral density ) is expressed with the parameters of resonances . through a dispersion relation , the parameters of qcd and vacuum are connected with the parameters of hadrons . to get reasonable conclusions on the properties of hadrons",
    ", it is very important to employ suitable currents .    in normal hadron case , the structure of meson and baryon is not so complex and sum rule works well .",
    "exotic hadrons such as glueball , hybrid and multi - quark state have complex intrinsic structure , there are often different ways to employ interpolating currents . furthermore , no exotic hadron has been confirmed such that the properties of exotic hadrons are not clear . whether qcd sum rule works or not has not been proved .",
    "it should be careful to employ reasonable currents and to draw corresponding conclusions on exotic hadrons .",
    "the existence of glueball was firstly mentioned by fritzsch and gell - mann  @xcite .",
    "glueball was studied in many models . in sum rules approach ,",
    "the interpolating currents consist of gluons fields .    for @xmath0 glueball ,",
    "the current was firstly employed by novikov et al@xcite .",
    ", @xmath2 where @xmath3 mev was taken as that of the @xmath4 without computation .",
    "subsequently , the @xmath0 scalar glueball was studied with the same current in many literatures . in narison",

    "@xcite , with a comprehensive inclusion of the contribution of operator product expansion , @xmath9 gev was predicted .    for @xmath1 glueball ,",

    "it is widely believed that the mass of the @xmath1 glueball is larger than that of the @xmath0 glueball .    in the constituent parton model , there are glueball with two gluons and glueball with three gluons . in sum rule method , in addition to the interpolating currents consisting of two gluons field , interpolating currents consisting of three gluons field have been employed .",
    "there is a large mass difference between the @xmath1 and the @xmath0 glueball prediction .",
    "the difference may results from the rough calculations or the special features of the @xmath1 glueball and the @xmath0 glueball . for the difficulty in the calculation of the ope",
    ", present results on glueball masses are not definite and may be improved largely with more accurate computation .",

    "as well known , two gluons glueball may mix with three gluons glueball , and two gluons currents may mix with three gluons currents .",
    "furthermore , this two kinds of currents couple to both kinds of glueballs .",
    "how to deal with these mixing effects is a great challenge in sum rule approach .",
    "final conclusions on glueball are expected to depend heavily on these mixing effects .",

    "different interpolating currents have been employed to study exotic states , but the structure of interpolating currents has no direct correspondence to the constituent structure of hadrons . the study of exotica with sum rule requires more exploration .",

    "the new observations by bes are unlike to be the pure @xmath1 pseuso - scalar glueball , they are unlikely to be the light tetraquark states either except that @xmath57 may be an exotic first orbital excited @xmath65 tetraquark state .",
