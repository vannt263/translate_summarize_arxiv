    "in the past decades a lot of attention was devoted to the study of formation of structures in closed systems with dissipative interactions ( ordering ) .",
    "this formation is often associated with decrease of entropy due to the the system s interaction with the environment .",
    "the latter is described effectively by the dissipative part of the interactions . in this work",
    "we consider the fundamental dissipative system of hard spheres with inelastic collisions .",
    "this serves as basic model of the granular material , which is the dissipative system of macroscopic particles which interaction involves friction , like sand .",
    "we demonstrate the formation of stable spatial structure in this system .",
    "the inelasticity of the collisions of the spheres , which model the sand grains , mimics the friction , describing effectively the transfer of energy to the inner degrees of freedom of the particles , that play the role of the environment for the translational degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "we use the popular model where the normal component of the relative velocity of the particles is depleted after the collision by a positive constant @xmath2 ( which is called coefficient of normal restitution ; @xmath3 for the elastic collisions ) .",
    "we consider the case where the inelasticity is small , @xmath4 , so the energy is `` almost '' conserved in each collision . in this case , the inelasticity effect becomes significant only after long time of evolution . over the mean free time",
    "( or the liquid relaxation time in the dense regions ) , however , the inelasticity is negligible so the collection reaches the state of the local thermal equilibrium @xcite . that is characterized by the local values of the density , temperature and velocity that vary throughout the system and evolve according to the equations of the fluid mechanics .",
    "the fluid - mechanical equations of the collection of inelastically colliding hard spheres contain a correction due to inelasticity . that brings finite effect over the time - scale of the order of @xmath5 times the mean free time .",
    "during this time - scale the energy depletion due to the inelasticity is of order one , so the system s state is completely different from the one of the elastic hard spheres .    in this work we use the fluid mechanical equations of granular materials to demonstrate new states of _ dense _ collections of inelastically colliding hard spheres where the liquid phase is present in the system .",
    "these states are states of mechanical equilibrium where the pressure is spatially uniform ( this uniform pressure decays in time though due to inelasticity ) .",
    "the forces on each fluid element are balanced so the fluid is macroscopically at rest and the density profile is time - independent .",
    "thus these states can be said to be closest to the equilibrium states of collections of elastically colliding hard spheres ( the thermal equilibrium is impossible due to the dissipation ) .",
    "the density however is inhomogeneous : the inelastic cooling opens the possibility of having stable inhomogeneous spatial profiles of density , which is absent in elastic systems .",
    "this possibility of having states of granular systems with inhomogeneous stationary profile of density ( called below the `` is '' for `` inhomogeneous states '' ) was first discovered in @xcite . in the",
    "is the heat flux caused by the inhomogeneity of temperature is balanced by the inelastic cooling which is also inhomogeneous so that the spatial profile of the temperature is preserved up to the depletion of overall amplitude .",
    "this spatial structure stably exists when the entropy monotonously decreases to @xmath6 ( the decrease stops eventually when the inner degrees of freedom start to return energy to the translational ones at the collisions ) , cf .",
    "however , the consideration of the thermodynamic limit of the is , presenting the highest interest , is not possible within the dilute limit : it was found that the maximal density of the is grows exponentially with the system size , so the density becomes comparable with the density of dense packing for large size of the system ( thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "thus the study of the thermodynamic limit necessitates considering dense regions . there ,",
    "usually , the study can be performed only phenomenologically due to the strong coupling between the particles ( for example , even the precise equation of state is unknown for liquids ) .",
    "we succeed in deriving the dense is that hold in the thermodynamic limit without approximations .",
    "that is , the is are derived for granular liquids , taking into account the finite size of the particles and the corresponding excluded volume effects .",
    "the derivation uses description that works uniformly both for gas and liquid phases including the possibility of coexistence of the phases .",
    "this is despite that the constitutive relations that appear in the fluid mechanical equations ( such as the equation of state ) are not known explicitly in the liquid phase .",
    "we note that the particular scaling form of those functions , that holds due to the absence of the intrinsic energy scale for hard spheres , admits the is solutions . due to the robustness of this observation",
    ", one can expect that the existence of the is is a fundamental property of granular materials .",
    "the is have unusual properties . these are states of coexistence of liquid and gas phases .",
    "the phases are described by the time - independent density profile that varies continuously in space from large values in the liquid phase to low values in the gaseous phase .",
    "probably the most striking property of the is is its particular organization of particles in space due to which the system does not dissipate energy in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is not because the particles freeze : the temperature is finite .",
    "however the flow of energy in space due to the inhomogeneity of temperature compensates the local energy losses due to inelastic collisions so that the energy obeys @xmath0^{-2}$ ] where @xmath1 diverges in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "in particular , since the local energy dissipation rate is determined completely by the local density and temperature , this signifies that these fields `` know '' of the system size in the is .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the well - known homogeneous cooling states , hs , @xcite , where the decay obeys the same law @xmath0^{-2}$ ] , but @xmath1 is a local property independent of the size of the system .",
    "furthermore , the total entropy decreases due to the dissipation logarithmically in time .",
    "this decrease is proportional to the number of collisions that occurred in the system .",
    "thus , roughly , the entropy decreases in each collision by the same , time - independent amount .",
    "our derivation of the is holds for systems where on average the system is dilute , so the fraction of space occupied by the gas phase is close to unity .",
    "( this is , in particular , the case of the clustering instability of the hs of granular gases , see below ) .",
    "however , the small fraction of space occupied by the liquid contains the fraction of the total mass that is close to unity .",
    "in contrast , the energy of the system is predominantly contained in the gaseous state , where the particles speed is higher .",
    "thus in the is both phases are present significantly , one carrying the mass , the other the energy of the total system .",
    "further insight into the physics of the is is reached by noting that the is becomes a `` time''-independent solution , when considered in the natural time variable , the number of collisions , using time - rescaled fields . to demonstrate this we provide a time - dependent transformation that transforms the original equations , that do not have explicit time - dependence , into the equations that do not have explicit time - dependence too .",
    "the is is the stationary solution in rescaled variables .",
    "we use this transformation to demonstrate that the evolution of small perturbations of the is obeys the power - law behaviour in time .    once the is solutions",
    "are derived , the question is if they are stable .",
    "the study of this question in the dilute case has a long history .",
    "it started from the study of the stability of the hs @xcite .",
    "this state plays the role of the equilibrium state for systems with size smaller than an intrinsic instability length @xmath7 times @xmath8 , which relax to the hs universally at large times .",
    "the scale @xmath7 is of order of the mean free path over @xmath9 .",
    "however the hs is unstable for larger systems due to the famous clustering instability @xcite .",
    "that instability , obtained by linearizing the equations around the hs , demonstrated the formation of clusters in the system that spontaneously break the translational symmetry .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that when the system size passes the instability length ( supercritical systems ) , simultaneously with uniform solutions getting unstable , the is appear ( that do not exist at smaller length ) . based on the analogy with instability in the newtonian fluids , one can expect that the is plays the role of the hs for supercritical systems and constitutes the result of evolution at large times .",
    "this was shown to be the case for not too large systems for the channel geometry of the particles container @xcite .    in the latter case",
    "the fluid mechanical fields depend only on the coordinate along the channel @xcite .",
    "the limit of fast sound was considered in @xcite , where the sound propagation time @xmath10 across the system is much smaller than the characteristic time of the decay of energy due to inelasticity .",
    "then , since @xmath10 is the characteristic time of relaxation of the pressure to the equilibrium uniform value , the inelastic evolution happens on the background of the pressure that is constant in space ( but not in time ) . as a result",
    ", one can reduce the compete system of fluid mechanical equations to one integro - differential scalar equation .",
    "the numerical study of that equation demonstrated that the is are stable .",
    "furthermore , the is provide universal result of the long - time evolution of the granular gas . in particular ,",
    "they determine the ultimate result of the clustering instability of the hs @xcite .",
    "thus the is provided the first consistent prediction on the long - time result of the non - linear development of the instability in a certain limit .",
    "this limit , though , demands that the length of the channel is not too large , so it can not be used to study the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the consideration of the latter limit demands considering the full system of the fluid mechanical equations , and it was not performed previously .    in this work we perform the numerical simulation of the complete system of the fluid mechanical equations of the dilute granular gas in the channel ( so that the integral equation simulated in @xcite is a reduction of this system in the limit of moderate system size ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the is is the result of the long - time evolution of the system for arbitrary length of the channel .",
    "since for arbitrarily large but fixed size of the system , the dilute gas holds in the limit of small size of the particles , our result signifies that the is is the result of the long - time evolution of the system in the thermodynamic limit taken _",
    "after _ the limit of zero particle size .    to complete the proof that the is is the universal result of the long time evolution of the collection of inelastic hard spheres in the channel",
    ", one has to deal with the finite particles size .",
    "the maximal density on the is of the dilute gas grows exponentially with the size of the system , so the consideration of the thermodynamic limit of the collection of ( real ) finite - size particles necessitates the study of the fluid - mechanical equations not constrained by the diluteness assumption .",
    "we perform this study using the following consideration .",
    "our derivation of the is does not assume that the fluid is dilute .",
    "though the form of the coefficients of the fluid mechanical equations is not known in the dense case , we demonstrate that the structure of the solution can be determined independently of that form if the system is dilute on average ( that is if the spheres were distributed uniformly they would form the dilute gas ) .",
    "the is in this case consists of the gas phase that occupies the volume s fraction close to unity and the liquid phase that occupies the remaining volume .",
    "the liquid phase produces effectively a wall boundary condition for the gas where the wall is located at the boundary between the phases .",
    "this structure of the is in the dense case is indicating strongly that it is stable . indeed , the gas phase is locally stable in view of the stability of the dilute is that was proved numerically .",
    "the liquid phase is locally stable too because the excluded volume effects do not allow significant growth of the density in the liquid state .",
    "thus the is is stable locally .",
    "if to discard the unlikely possibility of non - local mechanism of instability ( note that the mechanism of instability of the hs is local @xcite ) , then this completes the demonstration that the is is the universal result of the long - time evolution in the channel .",
    "the is solutions considered in this work depend on one spatial coordinate only ( we stress that microscopically the system is fully three or two - dimensional ) , describing the physics of granular materials in channels .",
    "the is solutions that depend on two or three variables exist too , so it is natural to pose the question of their role in situations where the fluid mechanical flows depend on two or three coordinates , which is the situation of box geometry .",
    "since the physics of the is solutions consists of the balance of the laplacian term describing heat conduction and local non - linearity corresponding to the inelastic cooling , then the role of dimension should be important because it is important for the laplacian .",
    "recent numerical results indicate that in higher dimensions the is are unstable . the work of @xcite reports that two - dimensional fluid - mechanics of granular gases produces finite - time singularities of density .",
    "this increases the importance of considering the dense is introduced in this work .",
    "indeed , finite particles size effects will necessarily regularize the singularity of the density , cf .",
    "the corresponding study if the dense is is the result of the long - time evolution of supercritical systems in the higher - dimensional case is the topic for future work .",
    "it is assumed in our study that the initial conditions do not contain the solid state phase and that the solid phase does not form in the system as a result of the evolution .",
    "this is reasonable due to the growth of the pressure in the liquid state .",
    "this guarantees the applicability of the fluid mechanical description .",
    "it is to be stressed that the fluid mechanical equations that we use are valid both in the dilute ( gaseous ) and in the dense ( liquid ) phases of the matter . though the form of the coefficients ( viscosity , heat conductivity , equation of state ... ) is not known precisely in the dense region , we succeed in dealing with the equations based on the separability of the dependence of the coefficients on the temperature and density that holds for hard - core particles .",
    "the result applies to the two - dimensional fluid of hard disks too .",
    "the following text is structured as follows . in the next section",
    "we derive the general form of the fluid mechanical equations of the hard spheres that collide inelastically .",
    "we show that these equations have a particular scaling form that holds due to the absence of energy scale in the the hard - spheres interaction . in section [ in ]",
    "we derive the is solutions of the fluid mechanical equations and demonstrate their basic properties ( that do not depend on the dimension ) .",
    "the following section introduces the time - dependent transformation of the fluid mechanical equations that transforms the is to the time - independent solution of a system with no explicit time - dependence , implying power - law behavior of the perturbations of the is . in section [ st ]",
    "we provide the implicit form of the is that depends on one spatial coordinate in terms of coefficients of the dense fluid .",
    "the next section provides the qualitative structure of the solution , that is relevant for the later consideration of the dense case .",
    "the following section describes the low - density limit of the is not confined to the case of the dependence on one coordinate .",
    "the study of the is of the dilute gas that depend on one coordinate only is performed in section [ s7 ] .",
    "though this case was solved previously @xcite , we provide the solution to stress its thermodynamic limit and to make the paper self - contained .",
    "the is in the dilute case serve the basis for the study of the is in the dense case in section [ dense ] .",
    "section [ s8 ] deals with introducing the lagrangian form of the fluid mechanical equations that is considerably more suitable for the numerical simulation .",
    "the latter is reported in section [ numerics ] .",
    "it is shown that the is provide the result of the long - time evolution of initial conditions that are arbitrary .",
    "section [ finite ] discusses the recent conjecture on the finite - time singularity of the density of the dilute gas in the light of the dense is obtained here .",
    "finally , in the conclusion we discuss the implications of our results on the general study of the granular materials .",
    "further questions risen by our results are considered .",
    "the fluid of elastic hard spheres has an exceptional feature that in the equilibrium the only energy scale is the temperature @xmath11 ( in usual fluids there is an energy scale that characterizes the interactions ) .",
    "thus , the intensive quantities , like the pressure @xmath12 or the thermal conductivity @xmath13 ( determined by the equilibrium properties via the kubo formula ) are determined completely by the density @xmath14 , the particles diameter @xmath15 and @xmath11 ( we set the particles mass equal to one with no loss ) .",
    "the only one of those quantities that contains the units of time is @xmath11 .",
    "this allows to use the dimensional analysis to determine uniquely the dependence of the intensive quantities on @xmath11 . in this way one",
    "fixes the temperature dependence in the constitutive equations for the functions that appear in the fluid mechanical equations .",
    "the inelasticity described by the dimensionless constant coefficient of the normal restitution @xmath16 does not introduce a new energy scale .",
    "this is a unique property of the considered model of the inelasticity , while other models typically contain an energy scale characterizing the inelastic part of the interactions .",
    "thus , the equations of hydrodynamics of the granular fluid of hard spheres also have coefficients which dependence on @xmath11 is fixed for any density .",
    "we pass to the description of the fluid mechanics of inelastic hard - sphere fluids .",
    "this form holds both for the dilute gases and for the dense fluids .",
    "we assume that inelasticity is small , i. e. @xmath4 . only under this assumption",
    "one can use the fluid mechanics , at least in its traditional form , that assumes the local thermal equilibrium .",
    "when @xmath4 the local relaxation to equilibrium that happens within a local relaxation time @xmath17 is weakly influenced by the inelasticity . in particular , the inelastic energy depletion that happens within @xmath17 is small .",
    "further evolution of the system consists of the evolution of the fields that describe the variation of the parameters of the local thermal equilibrium in space , i. e. the density @xmath18 , the velocity @xmath19 and the temperature @xmath20 .",
    "the evolution of these fields is derived from the local balance of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "the equations are obtained by expressing the latter and their currents via @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the inelasticity produces a local term in the energy equation that describes inelastic energy losses .",
    "we pass to the description of the equations .",

    "it will be clear below that to the leading order in @xmath29 the difference of @xmath16 from @xmath30 needs to be accounted only in the energy loss term .",
    "the reason is that this is the only term for which there is a degeneracy at @xmath3 , where it vanishes identically .",
    "its smallness is compensated by the large time of evolution ( however small , the inelasticity will produce the final state which is completely different from the @xmath3 case ) .",
    "the rest of the terms in the equations have a finite limit at @xmath31 , so their effect is perturbative .",

    "further we note that in the thermodynamic limit the energy @xmath135 will still approach @xmath298 since the divergence of the period of the particle s motion occurs in the region of large @xmath150 or small density , see section [ quality ] ( this follows from the fact that the major part of the volume is occupied by the dilute gas so that the time that the particle spends at large @xmath150 is infinite in the thermodynamic limit ) .",
    "thus @xmath149 has to increase at @xmath454 so that the smaller turning point at zero energy , defined by @xmath477 , is given by a finite @xmath150 of order @xmath476 .",
    "correspondingly we assume that the change in @xmath149 is such that it increases smoothly at @xmath454 in comparison with the dilute gas value but remains monotonously decreasing .",
    "note that the minimum of the potential is realized at @xmath478 that diverges in the thermodynamic limit and thus occurs at the density of the dilute gas , so the finite - density changes only the behavior of @xmath149 at @xmath479 , far from the potential s minimum .",
    "we assume that there is no new extremum of @xmath149 at small @xmath150 which seems physically necessary .",
    "thus @xmath149 decreases monotonously from @xmath480 $ ] to its minimum at @xmath481 where @xmath478 belongs to the dilute gas region .",
    "it follows that the qualitative structure of the solution described in section [ quality ] is not changed by the finite particles size .",
    "these changes become relevant when the energy @xmath135 of the solution is such that the smallest positive solution to @xmath482 is comparable with @xmath476 .",
    "they change the correspondence between @xmath139 and @xmath135 : the `` particle '' with coordinate @xmath148 spends different time at small @xmath150 . thus we introduce @xmath483 as the dependence of @xmath135 on @xmath139 determined by the condition that the half the period of the periodic motion with energy @xmath483 equals @xmath139 .",
    "the solution is given by @xmath484 } \\frac{dk'}{\\sqrt{2[e_{dense}(l)-u(k')]}}. \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it follows that in the region of the dilute gas where @xmath149 is the same as in the dilute case , the solution is the same as in the dilute case .",
    "the only change is that instead of @xmath485 that would correspond to the considered @xmath139 in the dilute gas limit @xmath486 , one has to use @xmath483 .",
    "introducing @xmath487 by @xmath488=e_{dense}(l)$ ] ( this is possible because both @xmath485 and @xmath483 are monotonic ) we can say that the solution in the dilute region is like for the dilute gas with the effective length of the channel @xmath487 .",
    "thus the solution in the dense case has the following structure .",
    "the density profile starts from its minimum at @xmath161 where the dilute gas holds .",
    "the density increases monotonously like it would for the dilute gas in the channel with the length @xmath487 ( note that @xmath487 tends to infinity in the thermodynamic limit ) . then at a certain scale",
    "@xmath489 the dilute gas assumption breaks down , so that in the region @xmath490 the density obeys @xmath491 .",
    "since there is no sharp boundary between the phases , then @xmath489 is defined up to a factor of order one , which will be seen inessential for the final result .",
    "the total mass @xmath492 of the dilute gas in the region @xmath493 can be described by the formula ( [ mass ] ) with @xmath487 instead of @xmath139 .",
    "the condition @xmath494 that the total mass equals @xmath205 gives ( @xmath495 ) @xmath496^{-1}={\\cal",
    "l } , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath497^{-1}$ ] is the mass of the liquid contained in the region @xmath490 with @xmath498 a constant of order one .",
    "since @xmath492 depends on @xmath205 only logarithmically and @xmath372 , then we find that at large @xmath205 ( one divides the equation by @xmath205 and takes the limit @xmath295 ) , @xmath499 that is almost all the mass of the system is contained in the liquid phase .",
    "to determine @xmath492 we note that since @xmath500 then we can use for @xmath501 the asymptotic form in eq .",
    "( [ das ] ) .",
    "this gives the self - consistency condition @xmath502 which gives @xmath503 since @xmath504 then @xmath505 , that is the effective length of the channel is where the liquid phase starts .",
    "in other words , the beginning of the liquid phase is like a wall boundary condition for the gas .",
    "it follows that the mass of the gas phase is @xmath506 where the approximate equality holds with logarithmic accuracy .",
    "thus the mass of the gas is infinite in the thermodynamic limit , however , it is only logarithmically large in the system size , demonstrating that the gas represent a vanishing fraction of the total mass of the system .",
    "the energy of the fluid is however determined by the gas phase and not by the liquid phase .",
    "indeed , the energy density is given by @xmath507 . throughout the region of the dilute gas , which occupies most of the volume ,",
    "this coincides with @xmath508 .",
    "it follows that the energy density is uniform through most of the volume , deviating from the constant only in the liquid region . in the latter region",
    "the energy density can be written as @xmath509 , so that it is bounded from above by @xmath508 .",
    "we find that the total energy @xmath94 obeys @xmath510 where we used @xmath511 derived previously .",
    "it follows that in the considered case where the gas is dilute on average , @xmath372 , so the gas phase volume is close to @xmath68 , we have that almost all the energy of the system is contained in the gaseous phase .",
    "the conclusion that though the liquid phase contains the fraction of the total mass that is close to unity , its energy is negligible , can be understood by noting that the temperature of the gas particles is much higher than of the liquid ones .",
    "consider for example , @xmath353 where @xmath512 , so that the temperature there @xmath513 grows linearly with the size of the system .",
    "thus though the gas particles are not many , their velocity is so high that they give dominant contribution into the system s energy .    finally , we consider the decay time of the solution @xmath1 @xmath514 see eq .",
    "( [ pres ] ) .",
    "we observed previously that @xmath515 , so it remains to consider @xmath516 .",
    "we saw previously that @xmath474 remains finite in the dense region , hence we can write @xmath517 where we used eq .",
    "( [ lg ] ) and noted that continuity and finiteness of @xmath474 imply @xmath518 ( the latter is because the density throughout the liquid phase preserves its order of magnitude @xmath449 ) .",
    "the first integral can be found using @xmath519 in the dilute phase , @xmath520 where one can write approximate equality because the integral is determined by @xmath521 that is @xmath522 is determined by @xmath128 inside the dilute phase far from the boundary of the liquid .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath522 is approximately the same as for the dilute is with @xmath523 instead of @xmath139 . using that @xmath524 we conclude that",
    "@xmath1 coincides with the one of the dilute is , @xmath525 thus the result that @xmath1 diverges in the thermodynamic limit is not changed by the finite particles size effects .",
    "the liquid phase influences the solution in the dilute region only by a minor correction to the effective length of the channel ( the wall becomes located not at the end of the channel , but at the beginning of the liquid phase ) , hence the uniform decay rate of the pressure which value can be found considering the dilute phase is approximately the same as in the dilute case .",
    "the study assumes that the solid phase does not form in the system , so that the fluid mechanics holds . though this seems reasonable due to the growth of the pressure when the density becomes comparable with @xmath526 , cf .",
    "@xcite , this question has to be studied .",
    "it is left for the future work .",
    "we conclude that for large system size the evolution reminds the gas - liquid transition .",
    "if one starts with the uniform initial state of the dilute gas , the formation of dense regions starts due to the clustering instability .",
    "the system develops the is where the liquid condenses in a small part of the total container that takes almost all the mass of the system .",
    "the larger fraction of the system s volume is occupied by the dilute gas . at the boundary between the two phases the no - heat flux b. c. holds approximately so",
    "that the gas state is the same as would hold if the liquid would be the wall . though the mass of the dilute gas is only logarithmic in the system size , the gas phase carries most of the energy of the system via the high velocity of its particles .",
    "in the recent work @xcite the numerical simulations of the fluid - mechanical equations ( [ fl ] ) of the dilute granular gas was performed in two dimensions .",
    "the results indicate the possibility of the finite - time singularity .",
    "this is quite plausible physically since the heat conduction coefficient that counterbalances the non - linear growth of the density due to cooling would tend to zero at such a presumed singularity . indeed ,",
    "if the pressure remains finite at the singularity , which seems to be the case , then the temperature tends to zero inversely proportionally to the growth of the density .",
    "though in the one - dimensional case the heat conduction does stop the growth of the density , in the higher - dimensional case , where there are wider geometric possibilities for the formation of regions of growing density , this might be not the case .",
    "in fact , this is indicated by the analogy between the is solutions and the soliton solutions of the non - linear physics . within the latter",
    "there are cases where in dimension higher than one , the non - linearity produces finite - time singularities that can not be stopped by the laplacian terms in the equations .    thus the conjecture",
    "that the density of the dilute granular gas becomes singular in finite - time when the container s geometry is a box ( which is described by fluid - mechanics of dimension higher than one ) is reasonable .",
    "this increases further the relevance of our derivation of the is in the dense case .",
    "the finite - time singularity signifies that the frame of the dilute granular gas is inconsistent in dimension higher than one , so that physical factors not included into that frame have to be taken into account .",
    "the immediate factor is the finite size of the particles and the related excluded volume effects .",
    "it is clear that the fluid - mechanics of ( possibly ) dense fluid of hard spheres , described by eqs .",
    "( [ constf]),([fluideq ] ) , does not have finite - time singularities becoming then @xmath527 only consistent framework of consideration in the higher - dimensional case .",
    "the is solutions ( including the uniform dense solution ) become then highly important as the reference solutions on which further theoretical and experimental study can rely .",
    "we described the is states of the dense fluids of inelastically colliding hard - core particles . though we used the fluid mechanics , the is are not really fluid mechanical : they involve no flow .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the temperature is preserved by the balance of heat conduction and inhomogeneous inelastic cooling .",
    "the is are exact solutions : they solve the complete system of the coupled pde of the fluid mechanics of the system . though the precise form of the coefficients of those equations is unknown in the dense region , we succeeded to demonstrate the is using only the special separable form of those coefficients that holds for hard spheres with constant coefficient of normal restitution .",
    "the inelastic cooling obeys the power - law @xmath0^{-2}$ ] where @xmath1 becomes infinite in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the growth of the cooling time ( that by itself is determined by the local density and temperature ) with the system s size signifies that the whole system is strongly correlated .",
    "the existence of the non - trivial steady state in the dissipative system ( the trivial one being the frozen particles ) is unusual .",
    "it poses for the study the question whether self - organization and the minimization of the dissipation can be related in the considered case .",
    "the is have universal properties that hold independently of the constitutive relations of the coefficients of the fluid - mechanical equations . the pressure and the energy decay as @xmath0^{-2}$ ] while the number of collisions that occurred in the system and minus the entropy increase as @xmath528 .",
    "the only unknown characteristic of the is is the form of the density field that does depend on the form of the coefficients .",
    "thus the is exhibit many universal properties that make one suggest that the displayed physical mechanisms can be important in other situations .",
    "the is solutions depend on the absence of the characteristic energy scale in the problem : the interaction of the hard spheres involves no energy scale .",
    "the is would not exist as exact solutions for finite interaction potential ( instead of the infinite step potential of the hard spheres ) that possesses a certain scale of energy , or for inelasticity which law changes at a certain scale of the energy . in the former case",
    "the coefficients of the fluid mechanics would have unknown dependence on the temperature , while in the latter case the coefficient of the inelastic energy loss term would have unknown dependence on the temperature .",
    "nevertheless , it seems that the considered model can describe realistically certain regimes of evolution of the granular media , arising as intermediate asymptotic regime .",
    "we introduced a transformation that transforms the is into the time - independent solutions of a system of pde that does not depend on time explicitly .",
    "thus one can pass to the `` frame of the is '' where the solutions are stationary .",
    "this is done by using the time variable which is the number of collisions that occurred in the system , and rescaling the fields with time to compensate for the decays due to inelasticity .",
    "in particular the transformation shows that the linear perturbations near the is obey the power - law behavior in time .",
    "to consider the is further we studied the dilute granular gas in the channel , where the fluid mechanical fields depend only on the spatial coordinate along the channel ( the microscopic motion is still three dimensional for balls and two - dimensional for discs ) .",
    "while the is in this case are known from the previous work @xcite , their stability was known only in the case of not too long channels . in the limit of large size the density field of the is has large variation where it changes from a small value ( that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit of infinite length of the channel ) to a value @xmath371 that is exponentially large in the channel s length .",
    "the interpolation between the two regions follows the inverse linear law .",
    "the mass contained in the neighborhood @xmath529 is of order one .",
    "these solutions hold if the diluteness condition @xmath530 holds .",
    "when the length of the channel is fixed , this condition holds if the particles diameter @xmath15 is small .",
    "we showed numerically that the is provide the universal long - time limit of the evolution of the gas when the length of the channel exceeds the critical length @xmath7 . to consider the thermodynamic limit for finite - size particles , where dense liquid regions appear in the fluid",
    ", we demonstrated the phase separation in is . in the limit of large system size",
    ", the fluid separates into the liquid phase , that contains most of the mass of system , and the gaseous phase that contains most of the energy of the system and occupies the volume s fraction close to unity .",
    "since there is local stability in both phases , then it follows that the is is globally stable and constitutes the result of the long - time evolution of the system .",
    "thus for the first time the question of the long - time limit of the granular gas is settled completely , though for a special geometry of the container .",
    "our study shows that the is play crucial role in the behavior of the granular fluid of hard spheres in the channel .",
    "the is however hold in any geometry of the container .",
    "their relevance to the case where the fluid mechanical fields depend on two or three spatial variables is important subject of future work .",
    "the numerical works reported in @xcite indicate that the dilute granular gas develops infinite density in finite time if the density depends on two coordinates .",
    "the is that take into account the excluded volume effects , do not have such singularities and become important objects for the study of the evolution in the box geometry of the container .",
    "this study is left for future work ."
