    ", one may average the branch - cut s contribution to get rid of the branch - cut s arbitrariness . as a result ,",
    "@xmath252 vanishes .",
    "finally , we are left with the relations @xmath264 and @xmath265 these expressions hint that one needs to identify @xmath266 as @xmath267 where @xmath99 or @xmath268 and @xmath269 this definition gives @xmath270 symmetry . noting that @xmath242 is the same as the one obtained from the anti - particle contribution in the contour integrations @xmath105 and @xmath106 in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] , we have particle and anti - particle symmetry of the vacuum @xmath271 .",
    "this demonstrates that the high - momentum ( hm ) mode @xmath46 , which exists only when the momentum is greater than @xmath1 , will make the particle and the anti - particle contribution to the casimir energy equal . in other words ,",
    "the vacuum respects the particle and the anti - particle symmetry .",
    "however , this is in a serious contradiction with the result from the thermal response calculation . even though the blackbody radiation  @xcite and the vacuum in an acceleration frame  @xcite distinguish the particle and the anti - particle responses at the order of @xmath34",
    ", one needs to avoid the hm mode because in the presence of the high - momentum mode , a particle with a small energy may have a low and a high momentum at the same time , and hm can spoil the commutative result because of the thermal density of the hm contribution which is the order of @xmath272  @xcite when @xmath146 ( @xmath272 if one uses the relation in eq .",
    "( [ energyid ] ) ) .",
    "thus , from the physics at the @xmath146 limit , one naturally should avoid the hm mode .",
    "this fact can also be seen in the dispersion relation for the high - momentum mode in eq .",
    "( [ eq : hm ] ) , which does not have the proper commutative limit . in this asymmetric ordering case",
    ", therefore , the vacuum breaks the particle and the anti - particle symmetry .",
    "thus , if one imposes the particle and the anti - particle symmetry on the vacuum , then one needs to modify the theory .",
    "even though the kmst is unique , the kps is not : depending on the ordering of the kernel of the fourier transformation , the @xmath1-poincar algebra is differently realized .",
    "there have been attempts  @xcite to construct the star - product of field theories . if the exponential kernel function of the fourier transformation is ordered symmetrically , then the casimir invariant given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : casimir - asm - inv ] ) changes into @xmath273 thus , the dispersion relation of the massless field changes into @xmath274 instead of the one given in eq .  ( [ masslessmode ] ) .",
    "this massless mode has @xmath275 invariance and the particle and antiparticle dispersion relation is simply @xmath276 . in this case , because there is no branch - cut ambiguity , one can expect the particle and the antiparticle symmetry of the vacuum and may construct a field theory with @xmath1-deformed poincar symmetry on the symmetric vacuum .",
    "on the other hand , the hm mode is also known to appear in particle and anti - particle spectra and to spoil the @xmath146 limit  @xcite .",
    "thus , one has to restrict the on - shell spectra and construct the field theory based on this observation .",
    "this restriction can be imposed as @xmath277 ( @xmath278 for the massless case and @xmath279 for the massive case ) , which respects the @xmath1-deformed poincar symmetry . the details of this investigation will be provided in a separate paper .",
    "in addition to the vacuum symmetry , the ordering is well known to affect the casimir energy from the studies of refs .",
    "21 - 23 for the case of two infinite parallel plates .",
    "the deformed effect is seen at the order @xmath280 , but the contributions are drastically different .",
    "the symmetric ordering deformation gives a more attractive effect  @xcite whereas the asymmetric ordering deformation reduces the attraction and can result in a stable configuration at a certain range of @xmath281  @xcite .",
    "the convergence of the @xmath135 expansion is considered in ref .",
    "22 where the @xmath135 expansion might turn out to be an asymptotic series expansion rather than a converging series expansion .",
    "it is not clear yet how these results  @xcite will change if the kps measure is incorporated .",
    "the structure of the higher - order series expansion is to be studied carefully in this spherical geometry also and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we remark in passing that the angular momentum summations of @xmath282 and @xmath283 are finite and are @xmath190 , as seen in eq .",
    "( [ ec - max ] ) , even though we put the regularization @xmath138 before the integration and summation . in the commutative limit , however , the terms @xmath282 and @xmath283 become infinity and can not be evaluated without a proper regularization .",
    "finally , suppose one considers the early universe and takes the casimir energy as one of the main radiation sources to the universe after the inflationary regime because the excitation modes decay away , but the casimir energy is just the vacuum energy and might survive during the inflation .",
    "then , at the final regime of density fluctuations , the casimir energy may leave some effect on the global structure of our universe . note",
    "that the casimir energy of a sphere measures the finite - size - corrected energy with respect to the infinite - size vacuum energy and is given as @xmath284 .",
    "therefore , the energy density inside the sphere is proportional to @xmath285 . in addition",
    ", one can confirm that most of the finite - size casimir energy comes from the lower part of the @xmath139 modes , about 90% of the contribution comes from @xmath286 to @xmath287 .",
    "the @xmath286 mode is the angular - independent contribution , and the @xmath288 mode can be removed by the motion of observer .",
    "therefore , the @xmath289 mode would be the most relevant mode in the cosmological sense , and it remains to be seen if its @xmath1-deformed correction can be detected at the large scale of the present universe .",
    "the regularized angular momentum mode of the casimir energy is given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rege ] ) : @xmath290 where we rescale @xmath113 as @xmath291 so that we can use the the explicit large - order behavior of the bessel function  @xcite . for large @xmath123 ,",
    "the large - order behavior of @xmath292 is given as @xmath293 where @xmath294 and @xmath295 is @xmath129 for large @xmath113 .",
    "the casimir energy is rewritten in terms of the large - order behavior as @xmath296 where the limits @xmath297 are to be taken at the end .",
    "let us consider @xmath298 in detail .",
    "@xmath299 is divergent when @xmath138 before summing over @xmath139 .",
    "thus , one needs to evaluate this term with non - vanishing @xmath96 : @xmath300 formally , one can write @xmath301 the integral can be done using a change of variable @xmath302 because the angular integral vanishes at @xmath53 .",
    "then , the line integral is finite and becomes pure imaginary , and the real part vanishes .",
    "( one can be convinced that the integration near @xmath303 is finite from eq .",
    "( [ eq : e0 ] ) directly . )",
    "this allows one to ignore @xmath298 and @xmath304 completely .",
    "@xmath307 in eq .  ( [ eq : enr ] ) for @xmath99 is given as @xmath308 in this appendix , we evaluate @xmath309 and @xmath310 in two different ways .",
    "one is to sum over @xmath139 first and to evaluate the integration later .",
    "the other way is to integrate first and to sum later .",
    "both ways provide useful viewpoints .",
    "let us consider @xmath311 using the summation result @xmath312 one has @xmath313 this integration is not convergent and is subtracted by @xmath314 : @xmath315 where @xmath163 is taken .",
    "it is to be noted that the limiting procedure is taken for the case @xmath316 .",
    "if one considers the case with @xmath317 , one has to use the absolute value of @xmath1 .",
    "likewise , for @xmath310 , one has @xmath318 the summation over @xmath139 gives @xmath319 and one has @xmath320 this integration is convergent , and @xmath321 vanishes as @xmath163 : @xmath322    now one may , instead , use integration first and get @xmath323 suppose one expands @xmath324 and @xmath325 in @xmath326 : @xmath327 in this expansion , there is no @xmath326 term in @xmath328 .",

    "( [ eq : e2a ] ) , the summation of @xmath329 over @xmath139 contains a @xmath326 term .",
    "this implies that the naive series expansion in @xmath326 is not valid .",
