    "the model of causal dynamical triangulations ( cdt ) was proposed some years ago by j. ambjrn , j. jurkiewicz and r. loll with the aim of defining a lattice formulation of quantum gravity from first principles @xcite .",

    "spatial slices of a triangulation are enumerated by a discrete _ time coordinate _ @xmath3 .",
    "to each vertex of the triangulation such time coordinate is assigned , bringing on a distinction between space - like links of length @xmath4 and time - like links of length @xmath5 . because each simplex contains vertices lying in two consecutive spatial slices",
