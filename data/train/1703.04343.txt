    "in order to understand the organization and function of the human brain , it is essential to study its fiber architecture , i.e. the spatial organization of the short- and long - range nerve fibers .",
    "mapping this highly complex fiber architecture requires specific imaging techniques that resolve the orientations of the fibers not only on a high spatial resolution but also on a large field of view of up to several centimeters .",
    "the microscopy technique _",
    "3d - polarized light imaging ( 3d - pli ) _ introduced by axer et al .",
    "@xcite meets these specific requirements .",
    "it reveals the three - dimensional architecture of nerve fibers in sections of whole post - mortem brains with a resolution of a few micrometers .",
    "the orientations of the fibers are obtained by measuring the birefringence ( axes of optical anisotropy ) of unstained histological brain sections with a polarimeter .",
    "the measurement provides strong contrasts between different fiber structures and allows a label - free microscopy and reconstruction of densely packed myelinated fibers in human brains and those of other species .",
    "birefringence of brain tissue is mainly caused by the regular arrangement of lipids and proteins in the myelin sheaths @xcite .",
    "the optical anisotropy that causes birefringence ( anisotropy of refraction ) also leads to diattenuation ( anisotropy of attenuation ) @xcite . in diattenuating materials , the intensity of the transmitted light depends on the orientation of polarization of the incident light @xcite .",
    "if the diattenuation is solely caused by anisotropic absorption , it is typically called _ dichroism _ @xcite . in the literature , diattenuation and dichroism",
    "are sometimes used as synonyms . here , the term _ diattenuation _ is used to describe the overall anisotropic attenuation of light that is caused not only by absorption but also by scattering .    as diattenuation leads to polarization - dependent attenuation of light",
    ", it might have an impact on the polarimetric measurement of 3d - pli and consequentially affect the derived nerve fiber orientations . in this study , we investigated the diattenuation of brain tissue and its impact on the measured 3d - pli signal for the first time .",
    "diattenuation as well as birefringence can be measured by conventional mller - matrix polarimetry @xcite or by polarization - sensitive optical coherence tomography ( ps - oct ) @xcite . while ps - oct uses the interference of the backscattered light to provide a depth profile of the sample , mller polarimetry measures the intensity of the transmitted light under a certain angle .",
    "often , incomplete mller polarimeters are used that measure only the linear birefringence and diattenuation of a sample @xcite . in the present study , a combined measurement of ( linear ) birefringence and diattenuation",
    "was performed with an in - house developed polarimeter that analyzes the light transmitted through the sample @xcite .",
    "previous measurements that study the diattenuation of a sample were performed on non - biological phantoms ( polarizing filters @xcite , siemens star @xcite ) as well as on collagen @xcite , tendon @xcite , muscle @xcite , heart @xcite , skin @xcite , eye @xcite , and biopsy tissue @xcite of animals or humans .",
    "several studies investigated the diattenuation of the retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) @xcite which only contains unmyelinated nerve fibers . to our knowledge , the diattenuation of myelinated nerve fibers and the diattenuation of brain tissue",
    "have not been addressed before and would need to be quantified .",
    "the diattenuation of tissue reported in the above studies was much smaller than the birefringence of the investigated samples and mostly of secondary interest . as the diattenuation might influence the measured birefringence values ,",
    "a couple of studies have been performed to estimate the error induced by diattenuation @xcite . for the 3d - pli measurement ,",
    "the question arises in how far diattenuation influences the outcome of the measurement and what are the consequences to the interpretation of the measured signal .    in other studies",
    ", diattenuation has been used to quantify tissue properties ( e.g.  thickness @xcite , concentration of glucose @xcite ) and to distinguish between healthy and pathological tissue ( cancerous tissue @xcite , burned / injured tissue @xcite , tissue from eye diseases @xcite ) .",
    "hence , diattenuation might also provide interesting structural information about the brain tissue and _ diattenuation imaging ( di ) _ could be a useful extension to 3d - pli .",
    "the present study was therefore designed ( a ) to quantify the diattenuation of brain tissue , ( b ) to quantify the impact of diattenuation on the measured 3d - pli signal , and ( c ) to investigate whether the diattenuation signal contains useful information about the brain tissue structure .",
    "the study design is reflected in the structure of this paper ( see [ fig : outline ] ) which is composed of a numerical study ( [ sec : numerical_study ] ) and an experimental study ( [ sec : experimental_study_on_brain_tissue ] ) .",
    "the numerical study was performed because the above literature suggests that the diattenuation signal is small and could also be caused by non - ideal optical components of the employed polarimeter .",
    "the numerical study estimates the impact of the non - ideal system parameters and the tissue diattenuation on the reconstructed fiber orientations and the measured diattenuation . in the experimental study ,",
    "the determined error estimates were taken into account to quantify the diattenuation of brain tissue and its impact on 3d - pli .",
    "the experimental study was performed exemplary on five sagittal rat brain sections . the numerical and experimental study",
    "are presented as separate studies , each divided in methods , results , and discussion .    the analytical model used for the analysis of these studies",
    "is developed in [ sec : measurement_setups_analysis ] .",
    "the model considers not only the birefringence but also the diattenuation of brain tissue as well as non - ideal system components .",
    "the non - ideal polarization properties of the polarimeter used for the numerical study and the polarization - independent inhomogeneities used for calibrating the experimental measurements were characterized in a preliminary study presented in [ sec : characterization_lap ] .    in an overall discussion at the end of this paper ( [ sec : overall - discussion ] ) , the results of the experimental study are compared to the predictions of the numerical study to validate the developed model . a list of all symbols and abbreviations used throughout this paper can be found in [ sec : symbols ] .",
    "this section introduces the physical principles and the mathematical notation used in this study . apart from birefringence and diattenuation , the mller - stokes calculus @xcite is described which will be used in the following to derive analytical expressions for the measured light intensities .      in optically anisotropic media ,",
    "the refractive index depends on the direction of propagation and on the polarization state of the incident light .",
    "this anisotropic refraction , known as birefringence , can be caused by regular molecular structures , but also by orderly arranged units far larger than molecules @xcite .",
    "light that travels through a birefringent medium experiences a phase difference ( _ retardance _ ) @xmath0 between two orthogonal polarization components ( ordinary and extraordinary wave with refractive indices @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) , which changes the state of polarization of the light .",

    ") @xmath4 to the direction of polarization of the incident light @xcite .",
    "previous studies have shown that myelinated nerve fiber bundles exhibit uniaxial negative birefringence ( @xmath5 ) and that the optic axis ( direction of optical anisotropy ) is oriented in the direction of the fiber bundle @xcite .",
    "like in all biological tissues , the birefringence of the nerve fibers is supposed to be small as compared to the refractive index of the fibers @xcite . in this case , the induced phase shift can be approximated as @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wavelength of the light , @xmath8 the thickness of the medium , @xmath9 the birefringence , and @xmath10 the out - of - plane angle of the optic axis ( i.e. the inclination angle of the nerve fibers , cf .",

    "the issues raised in the introduction can be answered as follows : ( a ) the diattenuation of the investigated brain sections is relatively small ( less than @xmath161 for @xmath215 m thin sections and the current preparation procedure ) .",
    "( b ) the impact of diattenuation on the measured 3d - pli signal was shown to be negligible .",
    "the small tissue diattenuation also implies that induced differences in the transmittance ( e.g. between horizontal and vertical fibers ) are expected to be small .",
    "( c ) the diattenuation images of the investigated brain sections showed two different types of diattenuation which occur in certain anatomical structures and seem to be regionally specific .",
    "the phase and amplitude of the measured diattenuation signal can be used as imaging modalities providing different contrasts and structural information in addition to those obtained with 3d - pli .",
    "thus , diattenuation imaging is a promising imaging technique and reveals different types of fibrous structures that can not be distinguished with current imaging techniques .",
    "the purpose of di as additional imaging technique should be further investigated in the future .",

    "the study was executed in two steps : first , the polarization properties were measured with different filter setups .",

    "the inhomogeneous illumination of the light source ( @xmath242 image contrast ) is much more dominant than the polarization - independent inhomogeneities of the filters ( @xmath243 image contrast ) and needs to be taken into account when analyzing the tissue measurements .",
    "the inhomogeneities of light source and camera can be compensated by dividing the acquired tissue images by an image without specimen . to further compensate the inhomogeneities of the filters and the polarization effects of the optical components , a calibration as proposed by dammers et",

    ", an equivalent calibration is not possible because a measurement without specimen would result in almost zero light intensity due to the @xmath40-orientation of polarizer and analyzer .",
    "instead , the images obtained from the xp measurement can be divided by the image of the light source and by the polarization - independent filter inhomogeneities of polarizer and analyzer ( see [ fig : pol - ind - inhomogeneities]a , b , d ) . as the filter inhomogeneities can only be determined for a circular region around the rotation center of the filters , the images obtained in the xp measurement need to be cropped to this region . a possible , significant parallax effect induced by the analyzer",
    "should be corrected before the calibration .",
    "it should be noted that these calibration methods only correct for multiplicative errors in the measured light intensity ( i.e.  inhomogeneous illumination , absorption , detection sensitivity , etc . ) .",

    "when analyzing the data , these effects need to be considered as described in [ sec : numerical_study ] and [ fig : numerical - diattenuation , fig : numerical_3d - pli ] .",
    "in principle , the impact of the tissue diattenuation and the non - ideal filter properties on the fiber orientations ( @xmath69 , @xmath75 ) derived from 3d - pli can be corrected exactly .",
    "if the values for @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath50 , and @xmath30 were known pixel - wise , the actual retardance @xmath0 of the brain tissue could be computed from the fourier coefficients in [ eq : a0,eq : a2,eq : b2 ] : @xmath244 @xmath245 using the determined value for @xmath0 , the actual fiber inclination angle @xmath10 could be computed via [ eq : delta_approx , eq : alpha_corr ] . the actual fiber direction angle @xmath53",
