    "strange matter hypothesis ( smh)@xcite suggests that the strange quark matter ( sqm ) , containing almost equal numbers of up ( @xmath0- ) , down ( @xmath1- ) and strange ( @xmath2- ) quarks under spatial and color confinement within a phase boundary that separates the collection of quarks from the non - perturbative vacuum of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , may be the true ground state of hadronic matter .",
    "finite size effects notwithstanding , small lumps of sqm ( or strangelets ) can also be more stable than ordinary nuclei  @xcite .",
    "a possible scenario for the formation of strangelets in the galaxy is the fragmentation of sqms ejected in tidal disruptions of strange stars ( sss ) in compact binary stellar systems  @xcite .",
    "simulations of ss mergers  @xcite , in fact , show lumpy structures in sqm ejecta .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that further fragmentation and separation of those lumps , as the ejected material approaches its thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium , will ultimately yield a set of strangelets , distributed over a range of mass , that contributes to the primary cosmic rays ( pcr )  @xcite .",
    "several other authors have also pointed out the possibility of obtaining strangelets in cosmic rays  @xcite . as an aid to the ongoing efforts to detect strangelets in pcr by pamela  @xcite , ams-02  @xcite and other experiments",
    ", we here determine a plausible mass spectrum of those strangelets at the site of ss merger by invoking a statistical multifragmentation model ( smm ) that is often used in the analysis of fragmentation of hot nuclear matter in various contexts  @xcite .",
    "this paper is , in fact , a continuation of our earlier attempt  @xcite to find the basic rate of injection of strangelets of different sizes in the galaxy . in an exploratory analysis in ref .",

    ", ignoring the mass of the @xmath2-  quarks is questionable .",
    "the value of the current mass ( @xmath3 ) of the @xmath2- quarks had been uncertain for a long time ; @xmath4  mev had often been considered in the past by several authors  @xcite . after a number of recent high precision estimates  @xcite , there has now been a consensus on @xmath5  mev , the mostly accepted value being @xmath6  mev  @xcite .",
    "a finite @xmath3 leads to a finite electric charge of the strangelets thus influencing their binding energy through the destabilizing effect of the internal coulomb repulsion in those strangelets .",
    "according to the standard mit bag model  @xcite , a large mass of the @xmath2- quarks makes them  less relativistic \" in comparison with the lighter ( @xmath0- and @xmath1- ) quarks so that the @xmath2- quarks tend to confine themselves to the interior of the strangelets away from the surface ( ie .",
    "the boundary ) of those strangelets  @xcite .",
    "this dynamical property of the massive @xmath2- quarks causes a depletion of their surface density of states thus contributing a  quark mode surface tension \" to the strangelets ; this is often referred to as the  dynamical surface tension \"  @xcite in the literature . assuming a chemical potential @xmath7  mev of the @xmath2-quarks , the magnitude of this quark mode surface tension is calculated to be @xmath8 at zero temperature .",
    "this magnitude is well within the range @xmath9 calculated recently in refs .",
    "@xcite from the linear sigma model ( coupled with constituent quarks ; lsmq )  @xcite or the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model  @xcite , although the origin of the surface tension is different in those models . without detailed investigation , one can not simply rule out the possibility that such quark mode surface tension of the strangelets and their electric charge , that are associated with non - zero values of @xmath3  @xcite , may make those strangelets unstable ( by increasing their energies per baryon above those for ordinary nuclei ) so that little or no strangelets may be available in pcr in the solar neighborhood .",

    "in this model , it is assumed that the initial strange matter , that was tidally released in the merger of two sss , had rather large ( but finite ) a volume while the finite - size effects due to its surface and curvature could be ignored . this initial bulk matter ( ie .",
    "the sqm ) was globally charge - neutral due to the presence of electrons inside the sqm .",

    "the equilibrium temperature @xmath10 at freeze - out is also considered to be lower than the initial temperature of the tidally released sqm . at the outset",
    ", it may appear that , to achieve thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium , the fragmenting system at freeze - out must be at a temperature of about a few tens of mev which is of the order of the binding energy ( per baryon ) of the bulk sqm .",
    "the fact that such a condition ( at thermodynamic equilibrium ) is not strictly necessary is perhaps exemplified by the nuclear statistical equilibrium ( nse ) established in a pre - bounce , collapsing stellar core in the course of its evolution towards a type ii supernova .",

    "the blob consists of finite domains that are about to be permanently segregated into numerous sparsely distributed , positively charged , finite - sized strangelets , each of them being embedded in ( and possibly penetrated by ) a charge - neutralizing cloud of degenerate electrons having a volume that is much larger than the volume of the strangelet . at freeze - out , the average distance between the strangelets is large such that the residual strong interactions between those strangelets can be considered to be insignificant .",

    "both these quantities require additional energy to produce copious smaller fragments at the expense of a few large fragments as we will find in sec .",

    "iv ) in this paper , the magnitude of curvature energy of strangelets ( with massless quarks in the mit bag model ) is more - or - less compatible at least with the lower bound of the surface energy determined in refs .",

( 6b ) and ( 6c ) ) need not be taken into account .",
    "the electric charge of a strangelet is given by that of the quark matter alone in the case of such small strangelets  @xcite .",

    ", we are required to reduce the average tidally released mass per ss merger to values within the corresponding range @xmath262 to comply with the results of the recent simulations .",
    "however , those simulations were performed only at two bag values near the upper and the lower ends of the aforesaid interval .",
    "precise value of tidally released mass for an intermediate @xmath100 can not be determined from those simulations .",
    "such uncertainty notwithstanding , in table 1 , we display the estimated ranges of integrated strangelet flux in the solar neighborhood for different intervals of bag values . in this table",
    ", we also display the tentative ranges of values of the average mass ( @xmath215 ) released per ss merger for different intervals of bag values with the _ caveat _ that the amounts quoted in table 1 for intermediate @xmath100 values are presented only for the sake of an illustration .",
    "the actual amount of this mass for an intermediate bag value can only be determined through detailed high resolution simulations of ss merger for a number of bag values lying within the range @xmath263 .",
    "such detailed simulations are yet to be performed . in table 1",
    ", large dispersions in the estimated fluxes for different bag values reflect on such limitation of the recent simulations in scanning the parameter space .",
    "they also reflect on the limited mass - resolution of the present simulations and also on the theoretical uncertainty in predicting the formation temperature of the strangelets . in the case @xmath213",
    "mev , for example , the simulated results predict a vanishing strangelet flux in the solar neighborhood . for an assumed tidally ejected mass @xmath264 per stellar merger ( that is an order of magnitude smaller than the limit of mass - resolution of the existing simulations ) , the approximation ( 16 ) , on the other hand , yields an integrated flux @xmath265 at a sufficiently low temperature ( @xmath266 ) at freeze - out in this particular case .",
    "such flux is , in principle , measurable in the observations with the detector systems being similar to the one installed in ams-02 experiment at the present level of its sensitivity  @xcite .",
    "table 1 predicts measurable fluxes of stable , ordinary strangelets in pcr for a reasonably wide range ( i.e. @xmath214 ) of bag values .",
    "the results displayed in this table seem to disapprove of the claim in ref .",
    "@xcite that the existence of a large number of ( stable ) strangelets in cosmic rays is highly unlikely and would certainly be negligible if color superconductivity is not considered .",
    "of course , nobody can deny the importance of studying multifragmentation of cfl matter leading to some sort of size distribution of cfl strangelets .",
    "we also note that such a study has already been undertaken in ref .",
    "@xcite by adapting a nuclear liquid - gas phase transition model  @xcite . in carrying out this calculation ,",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have found certain ambiguity ( or inconsistency ) in their results that has led them to conclude that either most of the cfl matter does not fragment at all or the standard techniques of smm are inadequate to describe the fragmentation of cfl sqm . in this context",
    ", we would like to point out that our preliminary results  @xcite on multifragmentation of cfl matter in the limit of massless quarks was free from such inconsistency .    the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have assumed the cfl strangelets to be more abundant in pcr because of their greater stability in comparison with the ordinary ones . accepting the importance of the detection of cfl strangelets in pcr",
    ", we still have some doubt regarding the feasibility of a mechanism producing those strangelets .",
    "recent hydrodynamical simulations  @xcite suggest that no cfl sqm is likely to be ejected outside the surface of the ns during the conversion of its interior into cfl matter",
    ". the combustion front would stop before it reaches the stellar surface . on the other hand ,",
    "the present scenario of tidally released quark matter in ss merger can not be extended straightway to cfl strangelets .",
    "this is due to the recent arguments  @xcite against the possibility of the observed cold compact stars being bare cfl stars ( cflss ) . to circumvent this problem , ouyed _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have invoked a scenario of collisions between hot and young cflss and their ns companions in compact binary stellar systems of the galaxy that may produce cfl strangelets .",
    "these authors find an estimate @xmath267 for the integrated flux of cfl strangelets in the solar neighborhood .",
    "a detailed derivation of that estimate is , however , unavailable in ref .",
    "although the present paper is focused on the availability of unpaired strangelets in pcr , we may still like to use approximation  ( 16 ) , along with the determined size distribution of strangelets in sec .",
    "iv , to get a rough idea regarding the order of magnitude of the possible intensity of cfl strangelets _ vis - a - vis _ the unpaired ones in the vicinity of the solar system . for this purpose",
    ", we first note that , for a  not unreasonable \" value of the pairing energy gap @xmath268  mev  @xcite , the lower bound of bag values for the stable cfl matter at zero temperature is taken as @xmath269  mev to avoid spontaneous decay of an ordinary nucleus into a two - flavor color superconducting phase  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , a simple extrapolation of approximation ( 16 ) to the case @xmath270  mev after the substitution of the possible lower bound @xmath271  @xcite of the rate of cfls - ns collisions in the galaxy along with an assumed tidally released cfl mass @xmath272 in each of such collisions is likely to bring down the integrated flux of cfl strangelets somewhere within the range @xmath273 .",
    "further improvement of such estimate would require the determination of actual size distribution of cfl strangelets which would be the subject matter of a separate paper .",
    "we however note that , an extrapolation of the results of the recent simulations on ss merger seems to indicate that , due to the supposedly compact nature of the cflss resulting from their larger binding energy , there is a possibility that the entire product of the cfls - ns merger may collapse into a black hole before the tidal forces have sufficient time to spew appreciable cfl mass out of the gravitational influence of the combined system .",
    "we could hardly expect to detect any cfl strangelet in pcr in that case .",
    "the ultimate vindication of smh would depend on the detection of either unpaired or cfl or both the types of strangelets in pcr .",
    "in this paper , we have examined a plausible model of the rate of injection of unpaired strangelets in the galaxy . a separate study of the possible mass distribution of cfl strangelets at their source as well as an examination of the more sophisticated galactic propagation models for both the types of strangelets are required to arrive at a definite prediction of strangelet - flux in pcr for ams-02 and other potential experiments .",
