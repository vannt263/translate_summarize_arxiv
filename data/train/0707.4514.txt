    "moreover , given the correlation between black hole and galaxy bulge mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "as hzrgs are rare objects , it is necessary to filter out low - redshift objects from large radio catalogues in order to maximize the efficiency of follow - up observations .",

    "we adopted a 60 arcsec search radius when searching for sumss matches around the position of each mrcr source .",

    "nvss matches in a sample of 234 sources is much less than one .    due to the difference in resolution of the mrcr , sumss and nvss catalogues",
    ", source confusion will affect the reliability of the spectral indices .",
    "therefore , we visually inspected each individual sumss field and removed any sources that were obviously blended at 408 mhz .",
    "in addition , as the resolution of sumss varies from @xmath100 arcsec@xmath32 to @xmath101 arcsec@xmath32 over the declination range @xmath102 to @xmath103 , we removed any sumss  nvss matches with an additional nvss match within 100 arcsec , except for five cases where high - resolution atca imaging confirmed that multiple nvss components were indeed matched to a single sumss source ( see table 3 ) .",
    "while the removal of such sumss  nvss matches imposes an implicit angular size cutoff in the sample , we do not expect a significant number of hzrgs to be excluded , if any .",
    "studies of powerful radio sources have found that linear size decreases with increasing redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and no hzrgs with angular sizes greater than 1 arcmin have been reported in the literature .    to optimize the optical / nir spectroscopy of our uss sample , it was essential to remove any low - redshift interlopers .",

    "however , for 32 sources , candidate optical counterparts could only be unambiguously identified after high - resolution atca images were obtained , leading to the inclusion of some low - redshift sources in the sample ( see section  [ 408_paper1_morphologies ] ) .",

    "thus , while the relative fraction of sources with concave spectra has increased with the inclusion of vlss data ( 25 per cent compared with 2 per cent in section  [ 408_paper1_spectral_indices ] ) , the majority of sources have negligible spectral curvature between 74 and 2368 mhz .",

    "<S> this paper introduces a new program to find high - redshift radio galaxies in the southern hemisphere through ultra - steep spectrum ( uss ) selection . </S>",
    "<S> we define a sample of 234 uss radio sources with spectral indices @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and flux densities @xmath2 mjy in a region of 0.35 sr , chosen by cross - correlating the revised 408 mhz molonglo reference catalogue , the 843 mhz sydney university molonglo sky survey and the 1400 mhz nrao vla sky survey in the overlap region @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we present australia telescope compact array ( atca ) high - resolution 1384 and 2368 mhz radio data for each source , which we use to analyse the morphological , spectral index and polarization properties of our sample . </S>",
    "<S> we find that 85 per cent of the sources have observed - frame spectral energy distributions that are straight over the frequency range 4082368 mhz , and that , on average , sources with smaller angular sizes have slightly steeper spectral indices and lower fractional linear polarization . </S>",
    "<S> fractional polarization is anti - correlated with flux density at both 1400 and 2368 mhz . </S>",
    "<S> we also use the atca data to determine observed - frame faraday rotation measures for half of the sample .    </S>",
