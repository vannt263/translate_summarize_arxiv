    "@xmath6 and @xmath7 are functions of the masses , orbital semi - major axes , inclinations , and nodes of the planets ; @xmath8 depends on these same quantities and the semi - major axis of the particle ; and @xmath9 is given by the planetary masses and orbital semi - major axes of the planets and of the particle .",
    "the number of eigenmodes describing the forced vertical motion equals @xmath10 and is usually equal to the number of planets in the system .",
    "the `` free '' or `` proper '' inclination , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 are constants specified by the initial @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "analogous equations exist for the test particle s eccentricity , @xmath13 , and longitude of periastron , @xmath14 .",
    "hirayama ( 1918 ) noted that certain asteroids share similar values of @xmath11 , @xmath15 , and semi - major axis , @xmath16 .",
    "he termed these groups `` families , '' and christened the first three families koronis , eos , and themis using the names of their respective first - discovered members .",
    "a family s members are thought to be fragments of a collisionally disrupted parent body . immediately following the disruption event , each fragment is characterized by osculating orbital elements @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , where the subscript @xmath20 pertains to the parent body just prior to disruption",
    ". fragments for which @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 have nearly the same @xmath11 and @xmath15 .",
    "a non - zero @xmath24 induces a change in the free precession frequency , @xmath25 .",
    "as the orbits of fragments differentially precess in their nodes and apses , their osculating @xmath2 s and @xmath13 s may span wide ranges , particularly if the magnitude of the forced term is close to that of the free term .",
    "however , the constants of integration , @xmath11 and @xmath15 , will remain fixed barring non - secular effects ( e.g. , close encounters with planets , or mean - motion resonant effects ) , effectively recording the inceptive shattering event .",
    "classical kuiper belt objects [ ckbos ; see , e.g. , the reviews by jewitt & luu ( 2000 ) , farinella & davis ( 2000 ) , and malhotra , duncan , & levison ( 2000 ) ] , which we define to be those bodies having orbital semi - major axes between 43 and 47 au , currently do not reside within low - order mean - motion resonances with the giant planets .",
    "secular theory well describes the dynamical evolution of ckbos on low-@xmath13 , neptune - avoiding orbits , modulo the effects of weak chaos ( torbett 1989 ; torbett & smoluchowski 1990 ; duncan , levison , & budd 1995 ) .",
    "here we report on an elementary calculation of the free inclinations and free eccentricities of known ckbos .",
    "we uncover evidence for the first collisional family in trans - neptunian space .",
    "the candidate family is dynamically reminiscent of a sub - family of the koronis population in the asteroid belt .",
    "section [ method ] describes our computational method , and section [ results ] contains results and discussion .",
    "osculating elements of ckbos were downloaded from the minor planet center ( mpc ; http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/tnos.html ) .",
    "we selected only those objects observed at multiple apparitions and having fitted semi - major axes @xmath26 .",
    "see millis et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for a discussion of how orbital uncertainties depend on the arclength of astrometric observations .",
    "the resultant list contained 125 ckbos .",
    "for each ckbo having an observed @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we compute    @xmath29    and similarly for @xmath15 . to evaluate the forced terms",
    ", we employ the secular theory of brouwer & van woerkom ( 1950 ; hereafter bvk ) for all eight planets of the solar system , as transcribed by murray & dermott ( 1999 ) . now",
    "the osculating elements of kbos given by the mpc pertain to epochs between 1994 and 2002 a.d .",
    ", and are referred to the ecliptic and equinox of j2000 . since the bvk solution defines @xmath30 to be 1900 a.d . , we take @xmath31 yrs in equations ( [ p ] ) and ( [ q ] ) and ignore the small , 8-year spread in mpc epochs . since the bvk solution refers to the ecliptic and equinox of b1950 , we transform the mpc orbital angles ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath14 ) to the b1950 frame using formulae provided by montenbruck ( 1989 , pages 1819 ) .",
    "differences between untransformed and transformed angles are no more than 1@xmath32 .",
    "we note also typographical errors in the transcription of the bvk solution by murray & dermott ( 1999 ) ; in their captions for tables 7.2 and 7.3 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 should instead read @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively , in keeping with their notation throughout the rest of chapter 7 ( subscript @xmath37 denotes the planet , while subscript @xmath2 denotes the eigenmode ) .",
    "our method for extracting proper elements is crude compared with modern techniques .",
    "we neglect terms higher than degree 2 in planetary eccentricities and inclinations ; see milani & kneevi ( 1994 ) to remedy this deficiency .",
    "we retain only terms that are linear in the eccentricity and inclination of the ckbo , forsaking the semi - numerical approach of williams ( 1969 ) and more recent , purely numerical approaches ( kneevi and milani 2001 ) that avoid expansions of the test particle s orbit altogether .",
    "thus , we can not expect accuracy in our results for highly inclined and eccentric ckbos .",
    "nonetheless , many observed ckbos execute nearly circular and co - planar trajectories for which we expect the errors introduced by our analysis to be small . and for simplicity and ease of implementation",
    ", our procedure is probably bested only by hirayama s celebrated and successful ( 1918 ) analysis , which included only a truncated jovian secular potential [ @xmath10 = 1 in equations ( [ p ] ) and ( [ q ] ) ] .",
    "it is in his pioneering spirit that we search for the first collisional family in the kuiper belt .",
    "figure [ free ] displays the inclinations and eccentricities , observed and free , of ckbos against their semi - major axes . while the observed elements betray no obvious clumping , this is not true for the free inclinations .",
    "we consider the population of kbos having @xmath38 and @xmath39 to be a candidate collisional family .",
    "table 1 provides the designations , semi - major axes , free elements , and @xmath40-magnitude inferred diameters of our 32 candidate family members .",
    "the free inclinations of our candidate family cluster about @xmath0 , similar to the inclination of the invariable plane with respect to the ecliptic , @xmath41 .",
    "this coincidence might lead one to suspect that these bodies represent primordial ones that coagulated in the invariable plane , rather than fragments generated by catastrophic disruption . in this alternative scenario",
    ", these bodies would appear in @xmath42-@xmath43 space at the point representing the inclination and node of the invariable plane referred to the ecliptic .",
    "would all such bodies share the same @xmath11 , without recourse to collisional genesis ? there are two ways by which they might do so , but both paths are prohibitive .",
    "the first way is if @xmath44 ( see figure 7.3 in murray & dermott ) , so that @xmath45 .",
    "the former condition fails to be satisfied ; for every one of our candidate members , @xmath46 .",
    "the second option demands that all bodies appear in @xmath42-@xmath43 space over a timescale much shorter than the local forced precession timescale of @xmath1@xmath47 . in this case , the forced inclination vectors of bodies appearing in @xmath42-@xmath43 space would be nearly identical since there would be insufficient time for the forced vectors to rotate . there would be differences in the amplitudes of the forced inclination vectors from body to body , but these would be small since @xmath48 is small for our candidate family and the bodies are far from secular resonances . consequently , the free inclination vectors of all bodies appearing at a single point in @xmath42-@xmath43 space would be nearly the same .",
    "however , for all members of our candidate family to have formed well within a time interval of @xmath49 seems unreasonable .",
    "current planetesimal coagulation calculations indicate kbo growth times of order @xmath50 ( kenyon 2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "by contrast , a collisional disruption event is virtually instantaneous ; we proceed under the hypothesis of a collisional origin for these objects .",
    "our candidate family boundaries were chosen based on visual inspection of figure [ free]c and the remarkable narrowing of the distribution of inclinations between panels [ free]a and [ free]c exhibited by our candidate family .",
    "a kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) test comparing the distributions of observed and free inclinations for our candidate family yields a 0.1% probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "we consider this probability sufficiently low that we believe the narrowing of the inclination distribution to be significant .",
    "no other subset of kbos in figure [ free ] evinces the same degree of sharpening when we transform from observed to free elements ; we compute corresponding k - s probabilities of @xmath120% for other subsets of kbos .    comparing the distribution of free inclinations of our candidate family to that of 22 kbos",
    "having @xmath51 and @xmath52 reveals no significant difference ; the k - s test yields a 38% probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same population .",
    "a comparison between our candidate family and the 12 kbos having @xmath53 and @xmath39 gives a corresponding probability of 13% , again too high to claim a significant difference .",
    "thus , our family , if real , might extend over the full gamut of semi - major axes from 43 to 46 au .",
    "subjectivity in the choice of family boundaries is a problem that afflicts even the relatively mature field of asteroidal dynamics , and clearly more objects would be desirable .",
    "we defer more sophisticated analyses of the significance of the clumping in @xmath54-@xmath16 space to future study . for the present ,",
    "we reserve our attention to the 32 kbos between @xmath55 and 45 au that exhibit the sharpest concentration of free inclinations .    the free eccentricities of our candidate family are more broadly distributed than their free inclinations .",
    "this characteristic is reminiscent of the koronis asteroid sub - family located at semi - major axes @xmath56 .",
    "this sub - family exhibits an absolute width of @xmath10.025 in @xmath15 and an absolute width of @xmath10.005 in @xmath57 ( bottke et al .",
    "2001 ) . and a second located at @xmath58 .",
    "the free eccentricities in the latter sub - family are markedly higher than those in the former , reflecting excitation via passage through a secular resonance located at 2.92 au ( bottke et al .",
    "2001 ) . the free eccentricities and free inclinations of the former sub - family are thought to be of collisional origin ,",
    "and we employ this sub - family as the analogue of the kuiper belt family proposed here . within the former koronis sub - family ,",
    "the spread in free eccentricities is still larger than the spread in free inclinations , and appears to demand an anisotropic distribution of ejecta velocities . ]",
    "the corresponding widths for our candidate kuiper belt family are 0.15 and 0.03 , respectively . that these widths are each @xmath16 times greater than their koronis sub - family counterparts probably reflects the greater ease with which orbital trajectories are altered in the more distant kuiper belt ; orbital velocities are @xmath14 times lower in the ckb than in the asteroid belt .",
    "the larger variation in @xmath15 compared to that in @xmath11 exhibited by both families presumably reflects a collision in which fragment ejecta velocities were greater in the ( invariable ) plane of the solar system than out of the plane .",
    "this , in turn , probably implicates a collision between two ancient bodies having greater relative velocity in the plane than out of the plane .",
    "the mass of the projectile , @xmath59 , that shattered the parent body could not have been much smaller than that of the parent , @xmath60 . for the kinetic energy of the collision ( measured in the frame moving at the center - of - mass velocity ) to exceed the gravitational binding energy of the parent body , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the escape velocity from the parent body and @xmath63 is the relative velocity between projectile and target .",
    "using the fragment sizes in table 1 that are derived from an assumed albedo @xmath64 , we estimate the minimum diameter of the putative parent body to be @xmath1@xmath65 , for which @xmath66 .",
    "the relative velocity must be a fraction , @xmath67 , of the local orbital velocity : @xmath68 .",
    "thus , @xmath69 .",
    "surface reflectance spectra of members of a dynamical family can lend supporting evidence for a common physical ancestry .",
    "the koronis sub - family exhibits relatively homogeneous s - type optical colors that set it apart from the more variegated field population ( e.g. , gradie , chapman , & williams 1979 ) .",
    "the parent body for the koronis family is thought to be @xmath1@xmath70 in diameter ( bottke et al .",
    "2001 ) , too small to have undergone significant internal differentiation .",
    "more massive parent bodies may have differentiated ; collisional fragments from such bodies may display greater variation in their spectral properties .",
    "thus , finding a large spread in optical colors among members of a given candidate family does not necessarily eliminate the candidate from the running ; widely different colors and/or spectra may instead offer a glimpse into the shattered , chemically zoned interior of a minor planet .",
    "unfortunately , color photometry exists for only 3 of our 32 candidate family members ( 1999 cm119 , 1999 hu11 , and 1999 co153 ) in table 1 .",
    "their b - v and b - r colors are plotted in figure [ color ] , along with the available colors of all other ckbos [ we employ data from trujillo & brown ( 2002 ) , selecting only those objects having @xmath71 .",
    "the tendency for the 3 candidate family members to be redder than those of the general classical population ( figure [ color]a ) may imply homogeneity of the interior of the putative parent body . alternatively , it may reflect whatever unknown process is responsible for generating the color - inclination correlation reported by trujillo & brown ( 2002 ) . in an attempt to separate out this effect , we plot only data for those ckbos having @xmath72 in figure [ color]b .",
    "there remains a tendency for our kbo family candidates to skirt only the lower envelope of the space spanned by all low-@xmath2 ckbos , though clearly there are too few points and the uncertainties in individual points are too large to claim significant segregation .",
    "we urge physical studies of the candidate family members listed in table 1 to further explore the possibility that we are indeed viewing the heretofore unseen interior of a massive , primitive planetesimal .",
    "i am grateful to marc w. buie and amy b. jordan for inspiring this calculation during an observing run plagued by fog and hail .",
    "i thank also an anonymous referee for a thoughtful and thought - provoking report that significantly improved this paper .",
    "this work was supported in part by a junior faculty research grant awarded by the university of california at berkeley .",
