    "the models proposed so far in the literature to describe the rate independent inelastic behavior of real materials subjected to monotonic or cyclic loading conditions can be essentially classified into two main families : ( i ) models where the present state depends on the present value of observable variables ( total strain , temperature ) and of suitable internal variables ; ( ii ) models , indicated here as _",
    "hereditary _ , that require the knowledge of the whole past history of observable variables .",
    "the first group encompasses , for instance , the classical models of prandtl - reuss and prager ( see e.g. @xcite ) and the nlk hardening model of @xcite , in its original form as well as in the modified versions recently proposed by @xcite and @xcite in order to improve the ratchetting modelling . for these models , the well known notions of _ elastic domain _ and _ loading _ ( or _ yielding _ )",
    "_ surface _ apply .",
    "_ associativity _ and _ non - associativity _ of the plastic strain flow rule are also well - established concepts , as well as the assumption of generalized associativity ( or _ generalized normality _ ) , relating all internal variable flow directions to a given loading surface @xcite @xcite . using the language of convex analysis @xcite",
    ", generalized normality entails that the flows of all internal variables belong to the _ subdifferential set _ of a given scalar non - negative function called _ pseudo - potential _ @xcite @xcite .    among internal variable theories , _ generalized plasticity _ deserves special attention .",
    "a first important step for its formulation was the idea , suggested by @xcite , of a plasticity model where , despite classical plasticity , loading and yielding surfaces are @xmath0 coincident .",
    "then , starting from an axiomatic approach to describe inelastic behavior of materials , lubliner proposed some simple generalized plasticity models , able to represent some observed experimental behavior of metals ( lubliner , 1974 , 1980 , 1984 ) @xcite .",
    "more recently , generalized plasticity has been used for describing the shape memory alloy behavior @xcite .",
    "_ endochronic _ models @xcite and _ bouc - wen _ type models @xcite @xcite are two important examples of hereditary models .",
    "endochronic theory has been developed during the seventies and used for modelling the plastic behavior of metals ( see , for instance , @xcite , @xcite ) and the inelastic behavior of concrete and soils ( among others , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the endochronic stress evolution rule depends on the so - called _ intrinsic time _ and is formulated by a convolution integral between the strain tensor and a scalar function of the intrinsic time called _ memory kernel_. when the kernel is an exponential function , an incremental form of endochronic flow rules exists , which is commonly used in standard analyses and applications .",
    "models of bouc - wen type are widely employed for modelling the cyclic behavior of structures in seismic engineering @xcite @xcite and for representing hysteresis of magneto - rheological dampers in semi - active control applications @xcite @xcite . the strict relationship between endochronic and bouc - wen type models",
    "has been mentioned several times in the literature ( see , among others , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite showed that the fundamental element of this relationship is the choice of an appropriate intrinsic time .",
    "endochronic theory and classical internal variable theory have been compared by using several approaches : @xcite observed that for endochronic theory the notion of loading surface can still be introduced , but it looses its physical meaning ; @xcite and @xcite proved that a nlk hardening model can be derived from an endochronic model by imposing a special intrinsic time definition .",
    "moreover , a comparative study between nlk hardening and generalized plasticity models has been presented by @xcite . a tight relationship between endochronic theory and generalized plasticity",
    "is also expected to exist , but , by the authors knowledge , no analysis on this subject exists . more generally , there is a lack of unified theoretical framework , on which formal comparisons between these plasticity theories could be based .",
    "the main goal of this paper is the formulation of this theoretical framework using the classical notion of _ generalized normality _",
    "@xcite @xcite . as a result ,",
    "a new formulation of endochronic and nlk hardening models as well as generalized plasticity models is suggested and is used to investigate the relationships between them .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the first section , the standard theoretical framework of thermomechanics is briefly recalled , with reference to the notions of pseudo - potential and generalized normality as well as legendre - fenchel transform and dual pseudo - potential . in the following sections , several plasticity models are presented and are shown to fulfil the generalized normality assumption .",
    "the prandtl - reuss and endochronic models are considered first , in both standard and multi - layer formulations .",
    "then , nlk hardening model and generalized plasticity follow .",
    "the discussion is limited to initially isotropic materials , whose plastic behavior is governed by the second invariant of the deviatoric stress , @xmath1 , known as von mises or @xmath1 materials .",
    "no stability analysis is provided , as it is beyond the purposes of this contribution .",
    "under the assumption of infinitesimal transformations , the classical expression of the local form of the first and second principle of thermodynamics can be written as follows : @xmath2 @xmath3 where the superposed dot indicates the time derivative ; @xmath4 is the entropy density per unit volume , @xmath5 is the vector of the flowing out heat flux , @xmath6 is the absolute temperature , @xmath7 is the rate of heat received by the unit volume of the system from the exterior ; @xmath8 is the second order symmetric cauchy stress tensor ; @xmath9 is the tensor of small total strains ; @xmath10 is the rate of interior entropy production . in the vector space of all second order tensors ,",
