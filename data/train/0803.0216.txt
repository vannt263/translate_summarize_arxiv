    "one of the puzzles of the big bang cosmology is the entropy problem . during the adiabatic expansion of the universe , the entropy per co - moving volume ( @xmath2 ) is constant , and s g _ * ^3 t^3 , where @xmath3 is the number of ultra - relativistic degrees of freedom",
    ", @xmath4 is the scale factor and @xmath5 is the temperature . @xmath3 does not change by more than a couple orders of magnitude during the history of the universe and we neglect its time dependence in the following analysis .",
    "the entropy of the volume corresponding to the current hubble patch , @xmath6  @xcite , which is stored in relativistic degrees of freedom is s_u = g _ * h^-3_0 t^3_0 10 ^ 88 . where @xmath7 stands for current values .",
    "the value of @xmath8 represents a puzzle .",
    "it takes its roots in the value of the present hubble parameter , @xmath9 .",
    "the problem is called the entropy problem .",
    "this puzzle together with the homogeneity of the observed universe  @xcite set the size problem .",
    "going back to the planck epoch one discovers that universe grew by a factor of = 10 ^ 32 , where @xmath10 is the planck scale ( in the following , p stands for planck epoch values ) .",
    "the physical size at the planck epoch corresponding to the current hubble radius ( @xmath11 ) is @xmath12 . in a power law expanding universe",
    "the hubble radius is roughly equal to the maximal causally connected region ( horizon ) .",
    "however , at the planck epoch the size of the universe corresponding to the hubble radius at that time is @xmath13 .",
    "hence , @xmath14 causally disconnected patches had to have approximately the same initial conditions in order that we observe homogeneous universe today  @xcite .",
    "this is the size problem which sometimes is called the homogeneity  @xcite or horizon  @xcite problem .",
    "note that the number of patches ( @xmath15 ) is n = = s_u where @xmath16 is the energy of the relativistic degrees of freedom in the volume corresponding to the current hubble patch .",
    "the solution of the size / homogeneity / horizon problem is found if the presence of the large homogenous patch @xmath17 with planck energy density is explained .",
    "one way to achieve this is to blow up an initial patch of size @xmath18 to size @xmath17 without significant loss of energy density",
    ". a period of accelerated expansion of the universe - inflation  @xcite is usually introduced for this purpose .",
    "problems of inflationary cosmology  @xcite motivate attempts to find alternative explanations .",
    "the paper  @xcite pretends to answer the size / homogeneity / horizon problem by a long period of intermediate evolution in a @xmath19 extra - dimensional universe .",
    "this allows slow enough decrease of the initial energy density without going into an inflationary regime .",
    "the scenario of the extra dimensional universe which is developed in the paper  @xcite has similar initial conditions to which is assumed in the hot big bang cosmology , the only difference is number of dimensions .",
    "namely , existence of a higher dimensional universe of linear size ( @xmath20 ) and energy density @xmath21 is assumed . to follow the evolution of the universe we assume that its content can be described by a perfect fluid and a weak anisotropic potential @xmath22 .",
    "initially , the evolution is governed by the perfect fluid ( bulk matter ) .",
    "isotropic expansion ends when @xmath22 can not be neglected any more",
    ". then anisotropic evolution begins .",
    "the ultimate requirement on @xmath22 is to prevent the decompactification of the extra dimensions .",
    "once the energy density is dominated by the potential , the extra dimensions shrink while our dimensions continue to expand .",
    "late time four dimensional cosmology is recovered once the extra dimensions are stabilized .    in this paper",
    "we show that the minimal value for @xmath23 is @xmath24 .",
    "the analysis is based on the fact that the universe has to achieve the current size ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "general arguments of the section ii show that 3 + 1 dimensional power law expanding universes with the one scale initial conditions ( universe of linear size ( @xmath20 ) and energy density @xmath25 ) have to have @xmath26 if no accelerated expansion is assumed , and for all @xmath23 , a radiation dominated epoch alone leaves the size / homogeneity / horizon problem unresolved .",
    "note , in general the radiation dominated epoch can explain the size / homogeneity / horizon problem if the initial energy density is assumed to be sufficiently high and there is no demand of the one scale initial conditions  @xcite . in the section iii",
    ", the scenario discussed in  @xcite is described from the effective four dimensional point of view and potentially can fit other extra - dimensional constructions .   - the 3 dimensional in the @xmath19 dimensions or @xmath27 - the scale factor in the effective four dimensional setup , is supposed to grow up the required amount .",
    "see  @xcite for the correction .",
    "] hence , we do not inter into details of the stabilization stage .",
    "we find analytical approximations for the evolution of the scale factor and the extra dimensions .",
    "in particular , we find a scaling solution which is in effect when two fluid components ( bulk matter and a potential ) can not be neglected .",
    "the new result shows that whether expansion is inflationary depends not only on the slope of the potential but also on the number of the extra dimensions ( d ) and the equation of state of the bulk fluid ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "we provide a numerical example for demonstration purposes .",
    "let us start with an isotropic patch of the size @xmath29 and an initial energy density of order @xmath30 .",
    "these initial conditions are referred in the following as one scale initial conditions . to reach the size of the currently visible patch , @xmath31",
    ", it has to expand by @xmath32 orders of magnitude .",
    "the evolution of the maximally symmetric hyper - surface without cosmological constant is described by friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) equations 3 m^2_p h_e^2 & = & + -2 m^2_p _ e & = & + , [ frw ] where @xmath33 gev is the reduced planck mass .",
    "the notations are as follows @xmath34 is the energy density , @xmath35 is the pressure , @xmath4 is the scale factor and @xmath36 is the hubble parameter in the einstein frame . in a power law",

    "see e.g.  @xcite . during this period",
    "the universe has expanded by @xmath43 orders of magnitude .",
    "up to the time of the big bang nucleosynthesys = ( ) ^k/2 , where i stands for initial and r - for the final values . for an arbitrary @xmath42 , @xmath4 grows by a factor of @xmath44 = ( ) ^2k = 10 ^ 2k ( x+3 ) .",
    "the requirement that the scale factor grows @xmath45 orders of magnitude imposes @xmath46 for @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , in a power law expanding universe , a non - inflationary solution of the size / homogeneity / horizon problem requires the scale of initial energy density to be larger than @xmath48 .",
    "as this scale is much larger than the planck scale , the frw equations  ( [ frw ] ) can no longer be trusted .",
    "note that in a radiation dominated universe the solution of the problem is technically impossible .",
    "explicitly , in the radiation dominated universe ( @xmath49 ) the available @xmath50 orders of magnitude are much smaller than the required @xmath45 orders of magnitude .",
    "hence , a new stage of evolution with a different equation of state is required .",
    "the arguments above are qualitatively different from the standard arguments like in  @xcite where there is no demand of the one scale initial conditions .",
    "in particular , a consequence of no demand of the one scale initial conditions allows to explain the size / homogeneity / horizon problem by the radiation dominated epoch alone .",

    "we also assume that all dimensions in the universe besides our 3 start small , of size @xmath64 , where @xmath23 is the initial scale of the energy density .",
    "furthermore , we assume that there is a patch in our three large dimensions of size @xmath64 with the same energy density , and from now on we concentrate on the evolution of this patch . in terms of @xmath65",

    "our new result is that the question whether the expansion is inflationary also involves the behavior of the bulk fluid .",
    "the numerical example explores the case where the potential itself does not cause inflation but the inclusion of the bulk energy density ( the scaling solution ) changes this .",

    "as shown in section ii , the minimal scale to resolve the size / homogeneity / horizon problem in power law expanding universe without inflation is @xmath120 .",
    "it is not generic at all , that such or higher energy density scale is allowed in a particular string theory model .",
    "in addition , the low energy field theory constructions should not be trusted at this or above scale since stringy effects become important . in this light",
    "the validity of the string theory based construction  @xcite to solve the problem is put under question .",
    "difficulty to find a non - inflationary solution based on this scenario might lead to interesting models of inflation ( like in  @xcite and  @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting feature of the setup discussed here is the freedom from the problem of initial conditions on the onset of inflation , namely , no fine tuning of the slope of the potential .",
    "one starts with a dense unique scale patch filled with bulk matter and ends up with inflation .",
    "note that in the cases  @xcite and  @xcite , the energy density in the bulk matter during the second stage is rapidly diluted and does not have much influence on the behavior of the scale factor ."
