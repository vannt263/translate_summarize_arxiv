    "dust is one of the main constituents of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , making up to 1 per cent of the baryonic mass of galaxies that is not in stars ( mathis , rumpl & nordsieck 1977 ) .",
    "the average composition of interstellar dust is made of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) , carbonaceous grains , and silicates ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) , each of which contains particles ranging from several angstroms to a few microns in size .",
    "dust plays many important roles in astrophysics : it provides attenuation of radiation ( cardelli , clayton & mathis 1989 ) , induces polarization in the optical and uv frequencies ( serkowski , mathewson & ford 1975 ) , provides a safe environment for molecular chemistry ( brown 1990 ) , cools protostellar clouds allowing for the formation of population ii.5 stars ( schneider et al .",
    "2006 ) , and , finally , provides the building blocks for the formation of terrestrial planets ( lissauer 1993 ) .    despite such fundamental roles played by dust ,",
    "the physics of dust nucleation is still highly debated , and the sites , rates , and composition of the dust produced in the different environments are poorly known .",
    "historically , dust nucleation has been treated as an out of equilibrium perturbation of a thermodynamical process ( becker & doring 1935 ; feder et al . 1966",
    "; kashchiev 2000 ) . under this approach",
    ", the dust / vapor mix is assumed to be in thermodynamical equilibrium and able to exchange energy in a continuous way .",
    "a critical cluster size can be identified as the cluster with the highest gibbs free energy and the nucleation rate is computed as the flow of particles through the critical cluster size ( becker & doring 1935 ; feder et al .",
    "1996 ; kashchiev 2000 ) . even though this `` classical '' theory can give an explanation to the qualitative features of nucleation ( the presence of a threshold below which nucleation is forbidden , the existence of supersaturation , and the steep increase of the nucleation rate with both temperature and saturation ) , the quantitative comparison between prediction and rates is still problematic ( wlk & strey 2001 ) . to make things worse , any attempt to improve",
    "the theory has resulted in a deterioration of the quantitative comparison .",
    "the adoption of the thermodynamical approach for astrophysical dust nucleation was criticized already by donn & nuth ( 1985 ) who pointed out problems with the time scale for obtaining thermodynamic equilibrium as well as discrepancies between the theory and experiments .",
    "an alternative to the thermodynamical treatment is the kinetic treatment of nucleation ( becker & doring 1935 , kashchiev 2000 ) .",
    "the kinetic theory derives nucleation rates by analyzing the accretion and ejection rates of monomers from sub - critical clusters .",
    "the most fundamental difference is that in the kinetic theory the nucleation rate depends on the properties of grains of all sizes ( and especially of the unstable ones ) while in the thermodynamic theory the nucleation rate depends only on the properties of the critical cluster .",
    "another advantage of the kinetic theory is that of allowing the consideration of radiation as a player in the nucleation game , as both an energy sink ( lazzati 2008 ) and as an energy source ( this paper ) .",
    "astrophysical dust nucleation is more complex than lab nucleation ( e.g. of water , wlk & strey 2001 ) for at least two reasons .",
    "first , the conditions of nucleation in astrophysics are very different from lab conditions and the verification of any theory that predicts nucleation rates of a particular dust compound can be performed only very indirectly .",
    "second , some of the components of interstellar dust , such as silicates , do not have a vapor phase and the nucleation process must include the chemical bonding of the atoms into the basic monomer of the grain .",
    "we call this process chemical nucleation to distinguish it from homogeneous nucleation ( the nucleation of a vapor on its own liquid or solid phase ) and from heterogeneous nucleation ( the nucleation of a compound on a different substrate )",
    ". this difficulty of chemical nucleation has been approached in two ways .",
    "kozasa et al .",
    "( 1989 , 1991 , see also nozawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2008 , 2010 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ; schneider et al . 2004",
    "; bianchi & schneider 2007 ) consider the nucleation process as driven by the atom that accretes with the lowest frequency , assuming all other compounds to be already present on the grain surface .",
    "it is unclear , however , how the very first molecules are formed and bound together in a sub - critical cluster .",
    "cherchneff et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and cherchneff & dwek ( 2009 , 2010 ) consider instead the chemistry of precursor molecules to bridge the gap between atoms in the gas phase and sub - critical clusters onto which the monomers can accrete .    in this paper",
    "we address another limitation of the thermodynamical treatment by considering the effect of discreteness in the energy exchange between the clusters , the gas , and the radiation field .",
    "we focus on the homogeneous nucleation of carbonaceous grains to avoid the complication of chemical nucleation , and approximate cluster surfaces as spherical to simplify calculations . as a consequence of the quantized nature of cluster - radiation and cluster - atom interactions ,",
    "the cluster vibrational temperature can grow well above the equilibrium temperature and/or decrease below it .",
    "we develop a monte carlo code to simulate the thermal history and stability of small clusters and grains and derive nucleation rates . due to technical computing limitations we can ,",
    "at present , address only the high temperature regime , since at low temperatures the interactions are overwhelmingly dominated by exchanges of radiation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we describe the theory of kinetic nucleation and obtain equations for the temperature fluctuations and ejection rates in small clusters , in section 3 we describe the results of the monte carlo implementation , and in section 4 we discuss our results .",
    "the kinetic approach to nucleation ( becker & doring 1935 ; kashchiev 2000 ) allows for the computation of nucleation rates in any non - equilibrium condition .",
    "the basic requirement is the knowledge of the accretion and ejection rates of monomers ( in our case carbon atoms ) from a cluster or grain .    the nucleation rate , i.e. , the number of new stable grains formed per unit time and volume , is given by : @xmath0^{-1 } \\label{eq : j}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the density of monomers in the gas phase and @xmath2 is the rate of the reaction @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a monomer and @xmath5 is a cluster that contains @xmath6 monomers .",
    "the rate of the reaction @xmath7 is instead indicated as @xmath8 .    in an equilibrium situation , where the cluster and the gas are at the same temperature ,",
    "the attachment rate is given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the sticking coefficient , @xmath1 is the number density of the monomer in the gas / vapor phase , and @xmath11 is the density of the solid phase .",
    "the detachment rate is instead given by : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the density of the gas phase at saturation for the temperature @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the surface tension or surface energy of the condensed phase .",
    "the extra exponential term takes into account the increased detachment rate from small cluster due to the effect of surface tension ( or surface energy ) that decreases the effective binding energy of monomers .    while the attachment @xmath2 only depends on the gas properties ( density and temperature ) , the detachment frequency depends on the cluster properties and can change substantially if the assumption of thermal equilibrium is relaxed .",
    "following lazzati ( 2008 ) , we assume that if the grain temperature @xmath16 is different from the gas temperature @xmath17 , the detachment frequency is modified as @xmath18 i.e. , we assume that the detachment rate depends only on the grain properties and not on its surroundings .",
    "later , we will describe an additional modification of the @xmath8 equation to take into account the reduction in detachment rate from very small and/or very cold clusters ( guhathakurta & draine 1989 ) . once eq .",
    "[ eq : gi2 ] is established , the challenge is to evaluate the cluster temperature to be used .",
    "lazzati ( 2008 ) assumed that the input and output of energy can be considered continuum and found the equilibrium solution , showing that in most cases the cluster stabilizes at a temperature that is smaller than that of the gas , due to the increased radiation losses . in this paper , we improve on that assumption by considering the quantized nature of the energy exchanges between the cluster , the gas , and the radiation field .",
    "we consider five interactions responsible for altering the thermal state of the cluster :    * attachment of a monomer to the cluster * detachment of a monomer from the cluster * collision between the cluster and an atom / molecule of an inert carrier gas * absorption of a photon * emission of a photon    due to the statistical nature of the occurrence of all the above processes , we include them in a monte carlo code . at each iteration",
    ", the code stochastically selects the event that would occur first . for that iteration ,",
    "energy conservation laws are applied to determine the thermal state of the cluster after the selected event occurs .",
    "the temperature change is computed through the change of internal energy , @xmath19 .",
    "the cluster size is also modified if an attachment or detachment event occurs .",
    ".glossary of used symbols [ tab:1 ] [ cols=\"^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      an important consequence of our analysis of the fluctuations of the grain temperature under the effect of quantized energy exchanges with the gas and the radiation field is that the grain stability becomes a statistical concept instead of an exact concept . in the classical approach ,",
    "when the gibbs free energy is maximized , the grain is supposed to be in an unstable but exact equilibrium , able to remain at the stable size forever .",
    "any cluster smaller than the critical size is doomed to evaporate and any grain bigger than the critical size will eventually grow . in our approach",
    ", two grains of the same size can be in different stability conditions ( one stable and the other unstable ) if they are at different temperatures .",
    "moreover , a grain that is stable can become an unstable cluster without changing its size by absorbing a photon that raises its temperature and vice versa .",
    "a critical size that depends only on the gas temperature and saturation - reminiscent of the one of the classical theory - can be defined as the size for which the probability of eventual evaporation is the same as the probability of eventual growth into a stable grain .",
    "here we discuss stability by finding the saturation at which a certain cluster becomes stable , according to the above definition .",
    "unfortunately the photon absorption interactions become so numerous at low temperatures ( @xmath20  k ) that running the code until a statistically sound number of c atom attachments or detachments is observed becomes practically unfeasible . for that reason , in the following we concentrate on the high temperature nucleation .    classically , the saturation at which a cluster with size @xmath6 is stable , or critical , is given by :    @xmath21    since @xmath16 is not constant in our approach , we determine the stability saturation for a given cluster at a specific gas temperature by proceeding iteratively as follows .",
    "we start from a fairly large saturation ( e.g. @xmath22 ) and perform a minimum of 10 simulations in which the grain may evolve at that saturation .",
    "each simulation is halted when the initial cluster has changed its size by at least 10 per cent ) this is more than enough to determine the final fate of the cluster . however , for small grains we halt the simulations after a 70 per cent change of the cluster initial size . ] . if all or most of the simulations resulted in grain growth , the estimated saturation was too large , and if all or most of the simulations resulted in grain evaporation , the estimated saturation was too small .",
    "we adjust our estimate of the critical cluster size and repeat the process , narrowing in on the saturation for which half of the clusters grow and half evaporate . in this way",
    "we can obtain a new stability curve , i.e. , the location in the @xmath23 plane where a grain of a given size has the same probability of growing or evaporating .",
    "this is analogous to the critical cluster size in the classical nucleation theory .",
    "thus , if the gas saturation is greater than the stable saturation the grain is more likely to grow .",
    "the stability plot for clusters with @xmath24 is shown in figure  [ fig : stabil1000 ] .",
    "for all gas temperatures , the new stability curve is lower than in the standard theory , generally allowing lower saturations in which clusters can grow .",
    "this is a result of three competing effects . at high temperatures ( @xmath25  k )",
    "the strongest effect is the einstein model correction that makes the clusters much more resilient to evaporation . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the grains are made more stable ( even more than the einstein correction prediction ) by the fact that their temperature is lower than the gas temperature ( lazzati 2008 ) .",
    "both these stabilizing effects are balanced by the effect of temperature fluctuations that tend to make clusters unstable .",
    "the drop of the stability line at low temperatures is expected to be reduced in the situation in which the radiation field is dense , so that interactions mediated by photons can also have a heating effect , as well as a cooling effect . in the case of a blackbody radiation field in thermal equilibrium with the gas ,",
    "the drop is absent , as shown by the star symbols in figure  [ fig : stabil1000 ] .",
    "this last condition may be relevant for dust production in a supernova explosions .",
    "figure  [ fig : stabil10 ] shows instead the stability line for smaller clusters with @xmath26 carbon atoms . in this case",
    ", the einstein correction term has a big influence , allowing its effect to dominate over the entire temperature range that we investigated .",
    "even the heating effect of a radiation field in thermal equilibrium with the gas does little to diminish the effect of the einstein model correction ( see the star symbols in figure  [ fig : stabil10 ] .",
    "this steep drop makes determining stability for lower temperature more difficult .",
    "also , smaller clusters are more susceptible to random fluctuations , inherent in our code , requiring more simulations , at least a minimum of 30 , to determine the new stability curve .",
    "another way to look at cluster stability and critical cluster size is to plot the attachment and detachment rates as a function of cluster size for given conditions of gas temperature and saturation . with the use of a monte carlo code like ours it is not straightforward to compute the average detachment rate for a given cluster size .",
    "that is because in a run , the cluster size varies ( see figure  [ fig : thist1000 ] and  [ fig : thist10 ] ) . in order to compute the average detachment rate from a cluster of a given size @xmath6 we run the code artificially maintaining the cluster size constant",
    "when an attachment happens , we compute the temperature that the @xmath27 cluster would attain , but we keep the size equal to @xmath6 .",
    "analogously , when a detachment happens , we compute the temperature that the @xmath28 cluster would have but we maintain the size constant to @xmath6 .",
    "this artificial forcing is equivalent to assuming that the temperature distribution of the size @xmath6 cluster is not different from the temperature distribution of the @xmath28 and @xmath27 clusters .",
    "figure  [ fig : ratesinout ] shows attachment and detachment rates from clusters containing between @xmath29 and @xmath30 carbon atoms embedded in a saturation @xmath31 hydrogen - carbon gas with @xmath32 and temperature @xmath33  k. the attachment rate is shown as a thick dashed line while detachment rates for different assumptions are overlaid .",
    "the classical detachment rate is shown with a dash - dot line , yielding a critical cluster of @xmath34 carbon atoms .",
    "the dotted line shows the predicted rate if the einstein model is considered but thermal fluctuations are neglected .",
    "the graph clearly shows that by itself the einstein correction is too strong , making even the smallest clusters stable at a modest saturation .",
    "this would result in a catastrophic nucleation of very small grains .",
    "the detachment rate with thermal fluctuations included is shown with a black line .",
    "interestingly , the attachment and detachment rates almost trace each other for the small , unstable clusters .",
    "this results from the fact that the biggest thermal fluctuations are due to the attachment - detachment process , since the binding energy is typically much larger than the photon and collision energies . as a consequence",
    ", an attachment results in a sharp increase in the cluster temperature that increases the detachment rate by a large factor , increasing the probability of a detachment , which in turn cools the cluster significantly .",
    "this locking of the attachment and detachment events is particularly evident for pure gases and for @xmath35 , in which every collision of the cluster is with a monomer that attaches to the cluster .",
    "less pure gases show this tracking to a lesser extent ( typically only for small clusters ) . in terms of the critical cluster size",
    ", we see that the critical cluster is smaller than the one predicted classically , but not by a huge factor .",
    "the complete theory with fluctuations predicts a critical cluster of approximately @xmath36 carbon atoms .",
    "once the average rates out for all sizes between @xmath29 and approximately twice the critical size have been computed , the nucleation rate can be calculated with a modification of eq .",
    "[ eq : j ] : @xmath37^{-1 } \\label{eq : jnew}\\ ] ] since the detachment rate is always significantly less than the attachment rate for @xmath38 , due either to linearity of the molecular bond ( thus a dramatic change in the internal energy ) or from a drastic drop associated with the einstein correction term , we realize that we can not clearly define a nucleation rate directly from the gas phase . instead",
    ", we assume that all of the gas particles have formed @xmath38 clusters , and compute @xmath39 using half of the number density of the gas .",
    "the extreme robustness of the @xmath38 clusters is probably due to the failure of the capillary approximation for very small clusters , as discussed below .",
    "figure  [ fig : j3000 ] shows the rates computed with our monte carlo code compared with rates obtained by other methods .",
    "the dash - dot line shows the rate obtained from the thermodynamic approach ( e.g. kozasa et al .",
    "1989 , 1991 ; todini & ferrara 2001 ; nozawa et al .",
    "2003 , 2008 , 2010 ) , while the dashed line shows the rate obtained from the kinetic theory under the assumption of thermal equilibrium between the cluster and the gas .",
    "a solid line shows the nucleation rate if the einstein model correction is taken into account , but thermal fluctuations are neglected . as expected ,",
    "this rate is very high since the correction makes clusters of all sizes stable .",
    "finally , a solid line with circles shows the result with temperature fluctuations .",
    "since , as we saw before , the combined effect is that of making the clusters more stable , the nucleation rate is significantly larger than the classical result , especially at moderate saturation .",
    "figure  [ fig : j4000 ] shows the same results for a hotter gas with @xmath40  k. finally , figure  [ fig : j ] shows a contour plot of the nucleation rate as a function of both gas temperature and saturation .",
    "it appears that the nucleation rate is highly dependent on temperature at high saturations , but becomes increasingly dependent on saturation as the threshold @xmath31 approaches .    a final , important result , if not the most important result of this work , is shown in figures  [ fig : hc1 ] and  [ fig : hc2 ] .",
    "the figures shows the nucleation rate of carbonaceous grains as a function of the carbon concentration in the gas , for @xmath41 and for various saturation values . according to the classical theory , both thermodynamic and kinetic ,",
    "the nucleation rate should only depend on the partial pressure ( or partial density ) of the compound that participates in the nucleation , carbon in our case .",
    "instead , we see that if thermal fluctuations are relevant , the nucleation rate depends quite strongly on the concentration .",
    "the dependence of nucleation rate on concentration is complex and not straightforward to interpret . for low saturation , the nucleation rate decreases as the relative density of the carrier gas increases , i.e. , a pure carbon gas nucleates much faster than a mixed gas ( figure  [ fig : hc1 ] ) . at intermediate saturations ,",
    "the fastest nucleation is observed at intermediate concentrations ( @xmath42 for @xmath43 , lower panel of figure  [ fig : hc2 ] ) . finally at high saturations , the nucleation rate increases at low concentrations ( or high @xmath44 values ) .",
    "the trend seen in figure  [ fig : hc1 ] at low saturations is easy to explain .",
    "the presence of carrier gas particles creates a thermal contact between the cluster and the gas that established thermal equilibrium without requiring growth or evaporation , breaking the strict growth@xmath45heating@xmath45evaporation@xmath45cooling@xmath45growth behavior outlined above and making the clusters more vulnerable .",
    "the trends observed in figure  [ fig : hc2 ] are instead more difficult to fully understand .",
    "inspection of the rate plots ( analogous to figure  [ fig : ratesinout ] ) suggests that the increase of the nucleation rate is due to the behavior of the grains just above the critical size rather than to the attachment and detachment rates from sub - critical clusters .",
    "we have presented a model for the physics of the nucleation rate of dust grains from the gaseous phase that includes the role of thermal fluctuations of the clusters as well as corrections for the detachment rates from nanoscale clusters .",
    "our implementation is based on the kinetic theory of nucleation ( becker & dring 1935 , kashchiev 2000 ) , but incorporates some fundamental changes in the way in which the thermal balance of the forming clusters is considered .",
    "first , we included a modification to the detachment rates from small grains , following the einstein model developed by guhathakurta & draine ( 1989 ) .",
    "this is a stabilization effect that takes into account the fact that very small grains at low temperature need to use a large fraction of their total internal energy to brake a bond and eject a monomer . as a consequence ,",
    "the ejection rate does not scale linearly with the surface but becomes very small for small grains .",
    "in addition , we consider the fluctuations of the grain temperature as the grain exchanges energy with the gas and the radiation field . since all the energy exchanges are quantized ( through photons or collisions ) , the temperature of the clusters does not attain an equilibrium value but rather continuously fluctuates around it .",
    "we find that the combination of these two effects results in an increased tendency of the clusters to grow , and as a consequence , yields higher nucleation rates .",
    "we also find that the nucleation rate depends on the concentration of the nucleating compound in the inert carrier gas , with higher rates for higher concentrations , especially at moderate saturation .",
    "this is a new result that has not been predicted by any other theory and can potentially become a crucial test for this model .",
    "* first , we were able to numerically implement the theory only for high temperatures , for which the rate of particle interactions ( cluster - monomer or cluster - carrier gas ) outnumber the radiation interactions ( carrier - photon ) .",
    "we can not therefore give any result for the interesting cold temperature regime , where supercooling of the cluster can happen , as discussed in lazzati ( 2008 ) .",
    "a possible solution for the low temperature regime is to treat radiation interactions as continuous and concentrate on the quantized nature of the particle interactions only .",
    "such implementation is under study . *",
    "more fundamentally , we have been implicitly adopting the capillary approximation , i.e. , we have assumed that the surface energy of graphite clusters is the same of the one of big graphite chunks and we have assumed that the concept itself of surface energy applies to clusters as small as a handful of carbon atoms , for which a surface is a hard concept to define . it is likely that this results in an overestimate of the binding energies of small clusters , ultimately resulting in an overestimate of the nucleation rate .",
    "* another potential overestimating factor is that we assumed the sticking coefficient to be @xmath35 , i.e. , all incoming monomers that collide with the cluster stick to it and make the cluster grow .",
    "the nucleation rate is directly proportional to the sticking coefficient and , since @xmath10 , our nucleation rates are overestimated if the real coefficient is different from 1 .",
    "in addition , reality is likely more complex .",
    "@xmath46 is probably dependent on the number of atoms in the cluster .",
    "clusters that fill all the bonds of carbon atoms ( such as fullerenes , for example ) , are likely to have very small values of @xmath46 since it is hard to make them grow beyond their closed structure .",
    "an @xmath6-dependent value of @xmath46 would , again , result in a decrease of the nucleation rate .",
    "* we have neglected the possibility of cluster - cluster interactions . even though these should not be numerous",
    ", they can be relevant for a particularly pure gas of the nucleating compound .",
    "* we have assumed that even the smallest clusters emit continuum radiation .",
    "it is instead likely that they will emit radiation in bands becoming more and more narrow as the size decreases .",
    "* we have assumed that all the energy released as a bonding of a new monomer happens is transformed into internal energy of the cluster / grain .",
    "however , it is possible that some of that energy is carried away by a photon .",
    "if this were true , smaller temperature fluctuations would be seen in consequence of attachments of new monomers .    despite all these limitations",
    ", we believe the two main conclusions of this work hold .",
    "first , thermal fluctuations are important in the nucleation process .",
    "second , if this is true , the nucleation rate should depend on the concentration of the nucleating compound .",
    "the difference of the nucleation rates resulting from different theories should warn us that a lot has still to be learned in this fascinating field and conclusions based on the blind application of classical nucleation rates should be taken with care ."
