    "the study of fluctuation superconductivity received a tremendous impetus from the discovery of the cuprate , high temperature superconductors@xcite .",
    "it was quickly realized that these were materials with large ginzburg parameters with the additional feature that many of them are also highly two - dimensional .",
    "more recently , interest has focussed on the systematics of their superconducting properties with doping and it has been found that this anisotropy is further enhanced with underdoping@xcite .",
    "conversely , the extent to which the anomalous properties of the underdoped compounds in the `` pseudogap '' region can be attributed to superconducting fluctuations is a question of considerable interest@xcite .    in this context",
    ", we report here a study of the magnetization of a two - dimensional superconductor , or more precisely of a stack of decoupled two dimensional superconducting layers , in a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath0 . by combining kosterlitz - thouless renormalization group flows and explicit computations for plasmas , we find the field and temperature dependence of the magnetization density , @xmath1 , for temperatures @xmath2 near to or below the kosterlitz - thouless transition temperature @xmath3 at fields @xmath4 .",
    "these results are interesting on three immediate fronts .",
    "first , the rough magnitude of @xmath1 and the trends exhibited in fig .",
    "1 are in accord with much of the data on the strongly layered cuprates in the field regime where a single layer theory is expected to apply .",
    "for example , this holds for the recent data of wang and collaborators@xcite which have demonstrated the existence of substantial fluctuation magnetization in the same region of the phase diagram of bscco which was previously observed to exhibit a large nernst signal@xcite .",
    "second , we find that @xmath5 is _ not _ independent of @xmath0 at criticality , as assumed in earlier analysis of the `` crossing point '' phenomenon in studies of the cuprates@xcite",
    ". instead , the critical magnetization follows m -_1 [ eq : critmag ] where @xmath6 is the distance between layers , @xmath7 is the flux quantum , @xmath0 is the magnetic field component perpendicular to the layers and @xmath8 is the microscopic short - distance cutoff length ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 are constants ) .",
    "third , we find that below @xmath3 , @xmath5 exhibits a low field growth indicative of the expulsion of vortices from the kt phase , m - ( 1- ) , [ eq : lowt ] where @xmath11 is the 2d superfluid density , related to the in - plane penetration depth via @xmath12 ( @xmath13 is a constant that vanishes as @xmath2 approaches @xmath3 , see below ) .",
    "note that this expression gives a simple relation between the superfluid density and the derivative of the magnetization with respect to the logarithm of the field , that can be used to determine when the system is indeed behaving as a stack of essentially decoupled two - dimensional kosterlitz - thouless films .    these results and the limits of their applicability to actual layered superconductors",
    "are derived in section ii , with some details relegated to an appendix . in section iii",
    "we consider experimental signatures of our analysis and the existing experimental situation .",
    "we close with a brief summary and some open questions .",
    "the average magnetization density of a superconductor in an external field @xmath14 is    _ 0*m*=*b*(*h*)-_0 * h * , where @xmath15 is the average ( uniform ) magnetic field , computed via = *",
    "* h , where @xmath16 is the total free energy density of superconducting matter coupled to fluctuating magnetic fields with average field fixed at @xmath17 .",
    "let us define & & f_sc = f_scm- ,  then + & & = -=-*m*. in type ii materials and for @xmath18 field energy is well - approximated by its uniform value , and therefore , following the equation above , the magnetization is to be computed from the free energy of a charged superfluid in a uniform _ external _ magnetic field . *",
    "*    we consider a stack of decoupled two dimensional layers .",
    "hence we will replace the three dimensional free energy density @xmath19 by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the free energy density of a single layer in the presence of a magnetic induction @xmath22 , now restricted to be perpendicular to the layers , whose effect will be to impose a density @xmath23 of field - induced vortices .",
    "to compute @xmath24 and thence @xmath5 we shall resort to the standard@xcite mapping of the two - dimensional vortex problem onto a two component coulomb plasma whose hamiltonian is given by ( see appendix a ) h = n_t e_c0 + _ s0 _ i < j p_i p_j + h_b .",
    "the number of vortices of charge @xmath25 is @xmath26 .",
    "the total number of vortices is @xmath27 and is allowed to fluctuate by the addition and removal of neutral vortex - antivortex pairs , but the net charge @xmath28 is constrained by the field @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath29 is the bare vortex core energy , @xmath8  the bare short distance cutoff ( e.g. , vortex core radius ) , @xmath30 is the bare superfluid stiffness ( inverse dielectric constant in the plasma language ) , @xmath31 is the area of the system",
    ". a uniform background density of charge to make the system neutral is necessary to insure a proper thermodynamic limit .",
    "the total coulomb interaction potential between the vortices and this background and between the background and itself is in the constant @xmath32 that depends on @xmath22 and on the size and shape of the system , but not on the vortex configuration .",
    "standard kosterlitz renormalization group ( rg ) methods@xcite can be generalized to the present , non - neutral situation .",
    "our strategy will be to renormalize until we can match on to a solution by an exact or approximate method . for convenience ,",
    "the bare superfluid stiffness and core energy are captured by the bare couplings @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which we will renormalize .",
    "in addition to these couplings we shall be interested in computing the free energy density , so we keep track of the configuration - independent term @xmath35 in the renormalized hamiltonian , generated as degrees of freedom are integrated out , i.e. , at any intermediate step in the rg process the partition function is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the renormalized cutoff .",
    "note @xmath35 is defined to be dimensionless .",
    "we also define the dimensionless density of field - induced vortices ( number per renormalized cutoff area ) as @xmath38 ; its bare value is @xmath39 .    provided the total number of vortices and antivortices per cutoff area is small compared to one , the following differential equations describe the renormalization upon increasing the cutoff to @xmath40 and integrating out neutral vortex - antivortex pairs with spacing less than @xmath37 : & = & 2xy [ eq : dy ] + & = & 2y^2 [ eq : dx ] + & = & 2 - [ eq : da ] + & = & 2 n  . the last line shows the trivial renormalization of the number of field induced vortices per cutoff area . a somewhat unexpected fact about these equations",
    "is that the presence of field induced vortices leaves the zero - field flow equations ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dy ] ) , ( [ eq : dx ] ) and ( [ eq : da ] ) ) unaffected ( also see sec .",

[",
    "note : since we have chosen to rescale lengths in our rg , the free energy density @xmath24 is computed by dividing the residual free energy , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , by the rescaled area , @xmath49 . ]",
    "the observation that field induced vortices do not affect the other flows , in particular that @xmath35 has no explicit dependence on @xmath22 , simplifies the calculation of the magnetization density : [ eq : magnetiz ] m=- = - , thus reducing the problem to computing @xmath47 .",
    "the renormalized density of field - induced vortices , @xmath50 , grows under the rg flow . for @xmath51",
    "thermally induced vortices become increasingly dilute and the system approaches a one component plasma in the low - field limit where the flow can continue to large @xmath46 .",
    "for @xmath52 , the renormalized density of thermal vortices first decreases and then increases , so that the system is always a two - component plasma with a scale - dependent charge imbalance . our principal results for the asymptotic behavior of magnetization ( eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) ) follow from the exactly known free energy of a dilute one component plasma@xcite whose parameters , the charge density , core energy and dielectric constant , are given by the rg flows above .",
    "a debye - hckel approximation for the free energy of the two - component plasma reproduces the correct low field behavior for @xmath53 and provides a reasonable approximation elsewhere , including @xmath45 ; we shall use it to generate plots of the magnetization versus field in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "for @xmath53 the above kosterlitz - thouless rg flows go to small fugacity @xmath54 , where the leading terms in the exact free energy are known for low density ( small field ) .",
    "thus we run the rg to a matching scale @xmath55 , where the parameters are @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "we stop and match when @xmath50 , which is growing , becomes of order @xmath54 . the free energy density of the remaining vortices , to leading order in the small parameters @xmath59 and @xmath58 is@xcite _ r = n_r k_b t(+ x_r n_r + o(1 ) )  .",
    "[ eq : ocp ] the first term is the ( renormalized ) core energy of the field - induced vortices , while the second term contains their entropy and ( renormalized ) interaction energy .",
    "the thermally - excited vortex - antivortex pairs do not enter at this order .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq : magnetiz ] ) the magnetization is [ eq : m ] m = -(+x_r n_r+o(1 ) )  .",
    "[ eq : mocp ]    to start , we consider the regime of small fields below @xmath3 . for @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a constant ,",
    "the renormalized parameters are computed from the kosterlitz rg equations as ( cf .",
    "( [ eq : xbelow ] ) ) x_r&&-c~- + y_r & & , so the low field magnetization is m=-(c + + o(1 ) )  , in agreement with our eq .",
    "( 2 ) above ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "the low field regime of validity of this expression requires @xmath63 , which , with the above constraint on @xmath46 , translates to be^-2_4/c  .",
    "observe that this condition defines a crossover length scale _",
    "< ~a_0 e^_4/c  , which has the functional form of the correlation length above the transition , and yet is defined  like the josephson correlation length in goldstone phases_below _ the transition .    for higher fields and temperatures near @xmath3",
    ", there is a crossover to the critical behavior ( 1 ) , that we derive below .",
    "note that the slope of @xmath5 vs. @xmath64 at low field vanishes linearly in @xmath65 as @xmath2 approaches @xmath3 from below , while the crossover field below which this is the behavior vanishes exponentially .",
    "if , on the other hand , one is near the kosterlitz - thouless transition ( so @xmath66 ) , the rg flows for @xmath67 follow -xy  .here when we match at @xmath68 , it is at @xmath69 and the resulting magnetization is m= - ( + o(1 ) )  , which is the same as eq .",
    "the field range where this result applies is b  , which is an intermediate field range for @xmath2 near to but below @xmath3 , and is all low fields for @xmath70 .",
    "our method of analysis in principle also gives the functional form of the crossover scaling function between these two regimes , but we have not been able to write this function in any concise form . however , below we obtain an approximate scaling function covering both regimes .",
    "it is worth noting that in the vicinity of @xmath3 the matching , which we choose to do at @xmath71 , occurs at @xmath72 , so it is the renormalized core energy ( the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mocp ] ) ) that is dominant in determining the magnetization .",
    "building on this last observation we now consider a debye - hckel mean field theory whereby the matching free energy is approximated by the contributions from the renormalized core energy and the entropy .",
    "this will allow us to obtain numerical results for the magnetization which are consistent with our previous exact results and can be extended to above @xmath3 .",
    "however , we must caution that these are approximate results , and the precise quantitative values of the magnetization do depend on aspects of the calculation that are not _ a priori _ constrained by what we already know about these materials .",
    "these unconstrained freedoms in the approximation we present below include ( @xmath73 ) the form of the matching free energy , in particular one might also include an approximation to the energy of vortex - vortex interactions , ( @xmath74 ) the scale at which the matching is done , and ( @xmath75 ) the bare vortex core energy .    specifically , we approximate the residual free energy density at matching as _ r=(n_r^+ + n_r^-)e_cr + k_b t ( n_r^+ n_r^+ + n_r^- n_r^- )  , [ eq : dhf ] where vortices and antivortices remaining at matching are at densities @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . the field constrains the difference between these densities to be @xmath78 , but their mean , @xmath79 , can vary and will take on the value that minimizes the free energy : = 2 e_cr+ k_b t [ ^2- ] + 2k_b t = 0",
    ". the matching condition is defined by asking that the average density of vortices be @xmath80 : = 1 [ eq : b ] and this is used to solve for @xmath81 .",
    "the choice of precisely unit density is clearly arbitrary  we make it for concreteness . with these assumptions",
    "the magnetization is given by m&&=- + & & = - [ eq : dh ] which is plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig : dh ] , [ fig : dhlog ] and [ fig : dhnonx ] .    above @xmath3",
    "the rg flows at asymptotically small fields are terminated at a finite fugacity and @xmath82 ( the zero field correlation length ) , so that as @xmath83 the magnetization vanishes as m-^2 b - e^/c b .",
    "this expression is consistent with an earlier linear response result@xcite .",
    "finally , three comments are in order .",
    "+ first , the divergence of @xmath5 below @xmath3 signals the expulsion of vortices from that phase  indeed the logarithmic divergence of the free energy of a single vortex with system size .",
    "the divergence we find _ at _ @xmath3 likewise signals the now weaker expulsion of vorticity ; at @xmath3 the free energy of a single vortex grows with system size as @xmath84 .",
    "second , the divergence of @xmath85 at low @xmath22 is a correct statement about the _",
    "magnetic induction _",
    "dependence of the free energy of a single layer in the limit of infinite penetration depth .",
    "it does not imply the divergence of an actual three dimensional magnetization density . for a stack of planes , the self - consistency implicit in eq .",
    "( 6 ) keeps @xmath86 from blowing up  instead we get the meissner phase ( @xmath87 ) at sufficiently low applied fields .",
    "our results are valid in the experimentally relevant regime @xmath88 ( equivalently @xmath18 ) where this distinction is not important .",
    "finally , for @xmath89 as we have already remarked @xmath90 separates the small field behavior from the critical @xmath91 dependence at larger fields .",
    "interestingly , the magnetization displays a noticeable temperature dependence even at these larger fields .",
    "it is noteworthy that this dependence is opposite to that implied by the explicit prefactor of temperature ( e.g. , in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dh ] ) ) , which by itself predicts an unintuitive enhanced diamagnetism at higher temperatures . to understand this important detail",
    "consider raising @xmath2 in the vicinity of @xmath3 .",
    "this leads to an increase in @xmath58 , which in turn gets strongly amplified by the singularity at @xmath92 of the functional dependence @xmath93 .",
    "this variation always overwhelms the contribution from the prefactor of @xmath94,so the combined effect is a reduction of @xmath95 upon raising the temperature , as expected .      in sufficiently anisotropic materials",
    "we expect that various weak interlayer couplings present will only affect the physics at long length scales and can therefore be treated to simply restrict the domain of applicability of the purely two - dimensional treatment above .",
    "as the application of the magnetic field introduces a new length scale , the intervortex separation or the magnetic length , this restriction means our two - dimensional behavior will cross over to three - dimensional behavior near a low crossover field .",
    "there are two basic types of interlayer interactions here : josephson couplings induced by charge fluctuations transverse to the layers , and electromagnetic couplings between currents in different layers mediated by the fluctuating magnetic field .",
    "we consider their effects in turn .",
    "the josephson coupling , @xmath96 , will a ) induce true three - dimensional long range order in the low temperature phase in zero field and alter the universality class of the transition to that of the 3dxy model , b ) shift the transition temperature upwards to @xmath97 and c ) cause the vortices to crystallize three dimensionally at any temperature below @xmath97 for fields less than the melting field @xmath98 . while this is a problem that has been studied in some detail @xcite we can get a feeling for the scales involved by considering renormalization of @xmath99 , the josephson coupling per cutoff area , near the ( decoupled layer ) kosterlitz - thouless fixed point , = ( 2-)(ja^2 ) . from this equation",
    "we can obtain the scaling of both the shift of the critical temperature in zero field , @xmath100 , and the field scale , @xmath101 , marking the crossover between two- and three - dimensional behaviors .",
    "this is done by evaluating the length scale at which the renormalized value of josephson coupling is comparable to the in - plane stiffness , @xmath102 ( which we shall set to its critical value @xmath103 , since its renormalization is comparatively less important than that of @xmath99 )",
    ". the upward shift of the critical temperature due to the josephson coupling , @xmath100 , can be estimated by identifying this scale with the zero - field correlation length , giving = , [ eq : tc ] where @xmath104 is a non - universal constant related to the behavior of @xmath65 near @xmath3 via @xmath105 , @xmath106 is another constant of order one , and @xmath107 is the bare josephson coupling per unit area .",
    "similarly , by substituting the magnetic length in place of @xmath108 , we find for the crossover field at @xmath3 , [ eq : bstar ] b_j=()^8/7 .",
    "the case of electromagnetic coupling alone is a little muddier .",
    "the situation in finite magnetic fields is that the vortices in different layers now experience an attraction and thus can crystallize three dimensionally even when a single layer is a vortex liquid .",
    "naively , the crossover field is of order the melting field , which is estimated to be @xcite b_b & & _ 0/^2 + & ~ & ( )  , where @xmath109 is the penetration length at @xmath3 .",
    "the impact of these magnetic interlayer couplings on the zero field transition does not appear to be a settled problem .",
    "the interlayer interactions are also logarithmic and thus are marginal operators at face value .",
    "this has led to assertions that the actual transition is still in the kosterlitz - thouless universality class @xcite . however , a renormalization group analysis by timm @xcite finds flows at variance with this scenario . for our present purposes ,",
    "we note that this crossover field is , for the case of large @xmath110 that we are interested in , less than @xmath111 ; it is this crossover that generally restricts the validity of our two - dimensional analysis to @xmath112 .    the scales @xmath101 and @xmath113 mark the rough boundary between two and three dimensional physics . at @xmath3 the low - field three dimensional state is crystalline , and the high - field two dimensional dependence of @xmath5 crosses over to fairly standard ( but with renormalized parameters ) low - field behavior in the abrikosov vortex lattice . at higher temperature at the three dimensional @xmath97 , in the presence of josephson couplings ,",
    "the crossover is instead to the @xmath114 behavior expected at low field in the 3dxy critical regime .    finally , one additional crossover , this time at large fields , is possible when the thermal phase transitions take place in proximity to a quantum phase transition out of the superconducting state  as may be germane in the case of the underdoped cuprates .",
    "standard scaling , when applied to magnetization of the @xmath115-dimensional quantum critical theory predicts @xmath116 , with crossover to this behavior taking place at sufficiently large fields where quantum fluctuations of the order parameter are important . the transition between the forms derived in this paper and this regime would be a striking signature of such fluctuations",
    "early experiments on the most anisotropic cuprates saw a near crossing point for the curves @xmath117 taken at varying fields @xmath22 .",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that they found a temperature at which the magnetization was field independent .",
    "this was interpreted in the scaling framework @xcite as evidence for two dimensional critical behavior with the one - parameter scaling form , f(t , b ) = 1 ^2 ( b ^2 ) for the free energy density . as we have shown in this paper , the scaling is not so simple at the kosterlitz - thouless transition , with its two marginal operators , and magnetization instead has a weak double - logarithmic dependence on the field . aside from this general scaling argument",
    ", there are three types of prior computations that we are aware of ( not listed in chronological order ) :    first , gaussian fluctuations for the ginzburg - landau theory in @xmath118 , yield a field independent magnetization at the gaussian ( mean field ) transition temperature@xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the absence of any marginal operators at this unstable fixed point .",
    "our calculation replaces this result as an account of the true low - field critical scaling of @xmath5 .",
    "second , the so called  lowest landau level \" approximation has been used by tesanovic and others to study strong amplitude fluctuations at high fields near mean - field @xmath119 ( see , e.g. , ref . ) .",
    "calculations of this kind have no overlapping regime of validity with ones presented above for the low field regime .",
    "it would be worthwhile to see if the two sets of results can together capture the behavior over the entire range of fields of interest .",
    "finally , bulaevskii , _",
    "et al._@xcite have considered the effects of thermal fluctuations on the magnetization of an abrikosov lattice in a layered superconductor with the josephson coupling being the dominant source of the three - dimensional order . treating the phonons of the lattice to quadratic order they compute the entropic correction to the ginzburg - landau - abrikosov free energy . at low fields @xmath120",
    "they find a field independent correction to the leading ( abrikosov ) logarithm .",
    "for @xmath121 they report a correction which is itself a logarithm and leads to an expression identical to our eq .",
    "the scale @xmath122 is the lindemann estimate for the melting field of the vortex lattice they begin with , so the computation is not really valid in the regime of the logarithmic dependence where the system is now a vortex liquid .",
    "nevertheless , at sufficiently low fields @xmath123 and @xmath124 their result and ours agree , a sign that the vortex liquid is locally quite similar to the crystal for these parameters . at higher fields and at @xmath3 , however , their reasoning breaks down as our calculation explicitly demonstrates .",
    "we now turn to the existing data on the cuprates , the systems that have motivated this work , and some suggestions for experimental tests of the theory .",
    "many of the cuprates are highly two dimensional and appear to become increasingly so with underdoping .",
    "the two most commonly used diagnostics of anisotropy are the resistivity and superfluid density tensors . using either of these in materials such as bssco-2212 we arrive at estimates of the anisotropy of order @xmath125 to @xmath126 between the ab ( cu - o ) planes and the c - axis .",
    "a somewhat more direct measure of the anisotropy can be obtained from observations of the c - axis plasma resonance due to interlayer josephson coupling . from the results of ref . for josephson coupling per area @xmath127",
    "we obtain 10 ^ -6 . for such anisotropies and other parameters appropriate to the cuprates , e.g. , as in caption of fig . 1 , we find @xmath128 , @xmath129 tesla and @xmath130 tesla using the estimates derived in section iie .",
    "this indicates that our two dimensional theory should give a useful account of the superconducting fluctuations for a reasonable range of fields .",

    "we then ignore the spin - wave part as it decouples from the rest of the problem .",
    "transforming back into real space we arrive at the hamiltonian of a non - neutral two component coulomb gas h_cg = d^2 * x * d^2 * y * n(*x * ) n(*y * ) , where @xmath139 .",
    "the range of integration above excludes the infinite self - interaction @xmath140 of each vortex .",
    "one last remaining ingredient is the bare core energy @xmath29 determined by the physics omitted in this derivation , it is usually taken as the energy cost of suppressing the order parameter inside the vortex core .",
    "so , finally , the hamiltonian of a superconductor in the external field is written @xmath141 , which is a continuum version of eq .  ( 7 ) .",
