    "the va - via compounds ( such as bi@xmath0te@xmath3 , sb@xmath0te@xmath3 ) are well known and have been extensively studied long time ago for their excellent thermoelectric properties.@xcite recently a new property of these materials , topological insulator ( ti ) , became one of the mostly focused subject of the condensed matter physics and material science.@xcite in the three dimensional ( 3d ) tis , the existence of the nontrivial topological invariance dictates that the excitation gap must vanish at the boundaries , thereby inducing the robust metallic surface states in contrast to the full insulating gap in the bulk .",
    "the spin - momentum - locked gapless surface states consisting of spin helical dirac fermions with a quantum berry phase could result in a variety of interesting quantum phenomena , such as the quantum anomalous hall effect and topological superconductor , because the back - scattering and localizaton is suppressed.@xcite a number of materials ( including hgte quantum well , bi@xmath4sb@xmath5 , bi@xmath0se@xmath3 , bi@xmath0te@xmath3 , and sb@xmath0te@xmath3 ) have been identified to be 3d tis , both through theoretical calculations and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes).@xcite among them , the tetradymite - like compounds such as bi@xmath0te@xmath0se , bi@xmath0te@xmath0s , bi@xmath0se@xmath0s and sb@xmath0te@xmath0se were predicted to host an isolated dirac cone on their naturally cleaved surface and attracted intensive attention.@xcite    besides the intensive study of the surface state in tis by arpes , scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) and theoretical calculation , the magnetotransport behavior of bulk tis is also important since it is directly related to the practical application .",
    "the gapless surface dirac states will induce some quantum transport behavior in tis that results in very large linear magnetoresistance ( mr  @xcite and quantum oscillation with landau sublevels @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the highly doped tis which have bulk carriers and exhibit metallic behavior , the competition between the contribution of the bulk carriers and the surface dirac carriers could induce some interesting transport properties , such as the quantum hall effect and layered transport of bulk carriers in doped bi@xmath0te@xmath3,@xcite , and the field - induced polarized transport of valleys in p - typed sb@xmath0te@xmath3.@xcite especially in bi@xmath0se@xmath3 crystals with bulk carriers , thermoelectric / thermomagnetic studies reveal the large zeeman splitting of the three - dimensional bulk band and the variation of the chemical potential above the quantum limit.@xcite these demonstrate the complexity of the surface / bulk states and the rich magnetotransport in tis with different bulk carrier densities .",
    "besides that , although the thermoelectric properties of va - via compounds have been intensively studied , there are few reports about the magnetothermpower behavior .",
    "the magnetic field influence on the thermal transport in ordinary metals is usually very small .",
    "initially the large magnetothermopower effect was observed in doped insb which was attributed to the effects of the sample geometry on the minority carriers.@xcite in a system with large magnetoresistant effect the magnetic field has significant influence on the properties of carriers and large magnetothermopower effect could be expected .",
    "the giant magnetothermopower effect was achieved in the giant magnetoresistant multilayer / granular systems and the colossal magnetoresistant manganites , which could be of interest for magnetic field sensors or magnetic controllable thermoelectric devices.@xcite    in this paper , we report the magnetoresistance , magnetothermopower and quantum oscillation study of sb@xmath0te@xmath0se single crystal .",

    "both the magnetoresistance and the magnetic torque shows quantum oscillation . the temperature - dependent and angular ( @xmath32 ) dependent cantilever or magnetoresistance signals are shown in fig . 5 and fig . 6 , respectively .",
    "the fourier transform spectrum of the oscillation at 0.4 k reveals a periodic behavior in @xmath33 with a frequency @xmath34 t when field is perpendicular to the @xmath15-plane ( @xmath32=0 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude can be used to determine cyclotron effective mass through the lifshitz - kosevitch formula.@xcite using the highest oscillation peak , the fitting gives a @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the bare electron mass ( the inset of fig .",

    "6(a ) shows the magnetic field direction dependence of the typical dhva oscillations of sb@xmath0te@xmath0se single crystal , and the detailed angular dependence of the oscillation frequency are shown by squares in fig .",
    "for a surface state or two - dimensional fermi surface , the cross section has @xmath37 angular dependence and the oscillation frequencies should be inversely proportional to @xmath38 . in fig .",
    "6(b ) , the angular dependence of the oscillation frequency can be fitted very well by @xmath31 ( the solid line ) .",
    "this indicates that the observed states in the quantum oscillation is quasi-2d fermi surface .",
    "however , the low - temperature resistivity of our material is @xmath39 m@xmath40 cm and the density of carrier from the hall resistivity is about @xmath41 @xmath42 , and both values are close to that observed in doped tis such as bi@xmath0se@xmath3 and bi@xmath0te@xmath3 .",
    "this means the bulk states should dominate the transport behavior in this material and the quasi - two - dimensional fermi surface observed in quantum oscillation should not come from the dirac surface states . in highly doped bi@xmath0se@xmath3 with a carrier density @xmath43 @xmath42 , it was reported that the fermi surface is large enough to touch the brillouin zone boundary .",
    "so the quasi-2d magnetotransport features in this system arise from the bulk of the sample acting as many parallel 2d electron system to give a multilayered quantum hall effect , instead of the surface state.@xcite our material has similar carrier density and then the quais-2d magnetotransport behavior observed in quantum oscillation ( fig .",
    "6 ) should have similar origin .",
    "besides that , the band structure calculation reveals that the bulk state in se - doped sb@xmath0te@xmath3 most likely is massive dirac state.@xcite , which possibly induce the linear magnetiresistance in high field as observed in other materials with dirac states.@xcite    in a nonmagnetic metal , the diffusion of carriers and the phonon drag effect will contribute to the seebeck coefficient .",
    "the diffusion mechanism of electron and holes will determine the sign of the seebeck coefficient .",
    "the phonon drag mechanism often gives a peak structure at temperature @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the debye temperature.@xcite in our crystal , the debye temperature from the fitting the specific data is @xmath46 k , and the peak around @xmath47 k in both of the seebeck coefficient in 0 t and 9 t field [ fig .",
    "2(c ) ] should come from the phonon drag .",
    "but the sign change of @xmath9 below 10 k can not originate from the phonon drag effect since magnetic field should have no influence on the phonon and the seebeck coefficient below 10 k is linearly temperature - dependent which implies that the diffusion mechanism dominates the low temperature seebeck coefficient . in a single band metal with diffusion mechanism and electron - type carriers ,",
    "seebeck coefficient is given by the mott relationship , @xmath48 where @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 is the chemical potential).@xcite from it the dependence of seebeck coefficient on field @xmath53 appears only in the conductivity matrix element @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the electron contribution to seebeck coefficient @xmath56 is usually negative while the hole contribution @xmath57 is always positive.@xcite for a two - band metal comprising electron and hole bands , @xmath9 is expressed as @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the contributions of electrons ( holes ) to the electric conductivity and seebeck coefficient , respectively.@xcite so the different sign of seebeck coefficient and hall resistivity implies the multiband effect in sb@xmath0te@xmath0se , while the linear positive hall resistivity implies that the single hole band dominates the hall transport .",
    "similar sign change in the seebeck coefficient by decreasing temperature was also observed in se - doped bi@xmath0se@xmath3 @xcite and one possible reason for this and the different sign between the hall and seebeck coefficient is the negative phonon drag peak superposed by the positive diffusive thermoelectric response.@xcite this could explain the positive - negative transition of seebeck coefficient by decreasing the temperature in our material .",
    "however , it could not induce the sign change by increasing magnetic field since the magnetic field should have no influence on the phonon drag , and this means the phenomena should come from the carriers .",
    "similar phenomena where hall resistivity and seebeck coefficient has different sign were also observed in some noble metals such as cu and ag and was attributed to the neck structure of the fermi surface.@xcite the fermi surface in ag and cu is far from spherical , but fermi surface just touches the brillouin boundary and has a set of `` necks '' at the brillouin boundary .",
    "@xcite our material has high carrier density and the quasi-2d magnetotransport behavior in quantum oscillation suggests that the fermi surface ( hole ) in doped sb@xmath0te@xmath0se is large enough to touch the brillouin zone boundary and should give similar neck structure as cu / ag .",
    "usually these necks are almost perpendicular to the brillouin boundary and the curvatures near the necks are oppositive to the residual fermi surface , as shown in cu / ag case .",
    "the neck structure gives a heavy electron - like ( negative ) contribution to the seebeck coefficient .",
    "the density of this electron - like states associated with the necks , is extremely large due to the rapidly varying surface with energy .",
    "but its contribution to the hall coefficient is very small because it has the very large effective mass and the residual fermi surface is massive dirac state with very large mobility .",
    "consequently the different sign between the hall and seebeck coefficient appears .",
    "the sign reversion of seebeck coefficient in magnetic field should be related to the different response of two kind of contribution from different parts of the fermi surface .",
    "similar effects were also reported in several other materials such as high-@xmath61 cuprates , and was considered as a signal of the fermi surface reconstruction.@xcite for example , the high - field @xmath62 and @xmath63 are found to drop with decreasing temperature and become negative in hgba@xmath0cuo@xmath64 , which is attributed to the charge - order wave and related fermi surface reconstruction.@xcite in similar materials bi@xmath0se@xmath3 with high bulk carrier density , a strong variation of the chemical potential and fermi energy above the quantum limit is observed and is believed to induce the observed increase in the nernst response.@xcite the change of the chemical potential could also happen in sb@xmath0te@xmath0se and it could suppress the contribution of the states at the necks of the fermi surface to the seebeck coefficient by suppressing the number of that states .",
    "besides that , with increasing magnetic field , the dirac holes will be very easy to form landau splitting and then occupy the zeroth lls ( achieve quantum limit ) gradually because of the high mobility and small effective mass , while the moderate field hardly has any influence on the states at the necks due to the very large mass .",
    "so under magnetic field the dirac holes will dominate the thermal transport behavior in the quantum limit since the fermi level locates between the zeroth and first lls and the dos at the fermi level is suppressed .",
    "the positive hall resistivity and seebeck coefficient confirm the dominant hole - like carriers up to some crossover field above which there is a sign change in @xmath65 due to enhanced contribution of bulk hole - like carriers .",
    "in summary , we report the magnetoresistance , magnetothermopower and quantum oscillation study of sb@xmath0te@xmath0se single crystal .",
    "the in - plane transverse magnetoresistance exhibits a crossover at a critical field @xmath1 from semiclassical weak - field @xmath2 dependence to the high - field unsaturated linear magnetoresistance which persists up to the room temperature .",
    "the low - temperature seebeck coefficient is negative in zero field contrary to the positive hall resistivity , indicating the multiband effect .",
    "the magnetic field induced the sign reversion of the seebeck coefficient between 2 k and 150 k , .",
    "the quantum oscillation of crystals reveals the quasi-2d fermi surface .",
    "these effects are possibly attributed to the large fermi surface which touches brillouin zone boundary to become quasi-2d and the variation in the chemical potential induced by the magnetic field .",
