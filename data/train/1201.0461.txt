    "a group of objects is split into a number of more or less homogeneous subgroups on the basis of an often subjectively chosen measure of similarity ( i.e. , chosen subjectively based on its ability to create `` interesting '' clusters ) such that the similarity between objects within a subgroup is larger than the similarity between objects belonging to different subgroups  . a key problem in the clustering domain is to determine the number of output clusters @xmath1 .",
    "use of cooperative game theory provides a novel way of addressing this problem by using a variety of solution concepts .",
    "in the rest of this section , we justify the use of game theoretic solution concepts , specifically nucleolus , for pattern clustering , give an intuition why the various solution concepts coincide and refer to a few recent works in clustering using game theory . in section  [ sec : prelim ] , we provide a brief introduction to the relevant solution concepts in cooperative game theory . sections  [ sec : gamemodel ]",

    "sharpc  @xcite proposes a novel approach to find the cluster centers in order to give a good start to k - means , which thus results in the desired clustering .",
    "the limitation of this approach is that it is restricted to k - means , which is not always desirable especially when the classes have unequal variances or when they lack convex nature .",
    "we , therefore , extend this approach to a more general clustering problem in @xmath2 .",
    "as it will be clear in section  [ sec : prelim ] , shapley value is based on average fairness , gately point is based on stability , @xmath0-value is based on efficiency while nucleolus is based on both min - max fairness and stability .",
    "hence , it is worthwhile exploring these solution concepts to harness their properties for the clustering game . of these solution concepts , the properties of nucleolus , viz . ,",
    "fairness and stability , are the most suitable for the clustering game .",
    "moreover , we show in section  [ sec : equiv_nuc_shap ] that all these solution concepts coincide for the chosen characteristic function . as finding nucleolus , for instance ,",
    "is computationally expensive , it is to our advantage if we use the computational ease of other solution concepts .",
    "we see in section  [ sec : gamemodel ] that for the chosen characteristic function , the shapley value can be computed in polynomial time .",
    "so for our algorithm , we use shapley value , which is equivalent to using any or all of these solution concepts .",
    "the prime reason for the coincidence of the relevant solution concepts is that the core , which we will see in section  [ core ] , is symmetric about a single point and all these solution concepts coincide with that very point .",
    "we will discuss this situation in detail and prove it formally in section  [ sec : equiv_nuc_shap ] .",

    "collective rationality i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "3 .   coalitional rationality i.e. @xmath15 .",
    "a payoff allocation satisfying individual rationality and collective rationality is called an _",

    "consider the excess defined by @xmath17 @xmath18 is a measure of unhappiness of @xmath19 with @xmath16 .",
    "the goal of nucleolus is to minimize the most unhappy coalition , i.e. , largest of the @xmath18 .",

    "moreover , as equation [ shapleyeq ] shows the ease of computation of shapley value in the clustering game with the chosen characteristic function , we use shapley value as the base solution concept for our algorithm .    the basic idea behind",
    "the algorithm is that we expand the clusters based on density . from equations [ similarityfn ] and [ shapleyeq ] , shapley value represents density in some sense . for every cluster ,",
    "we start with an unallocated point with the maximum shapley value and assign it as the cluster center .",
    "if that point has high density around it , it should only consider the close - by points , otherwise it should consider more faraway points .",
    "we implement this idea in step [ calcbeta ] of algorithm [ dracalgo ] with parameter @xmath49 . for the point with the globally maximum shapley value , @xmath50 , while it is low for other cluster centers .",
    "also , as we go from cluster center with the highest shapley value to those with lower values , we do not want to degrade the value of @xmath49 linearly .",
    "so we have square - root function in step [ calcbeta ] .",

    "let @xmath53 be the global maximum of shapley values .",
    "start a new queue , let s call it _",
    "expansion queue_. [ startagain ] start a new cluster .",
    "of all the unallocated points , choose the point with maximum shapley value as the new cluster center .",
    "let @xmath54 be its shapley value .",
    "mark that point as allocated .",
    "add it to the expansion queue .",
    "[ calcbeta ] set @xmath55 .",
    "[ substart ] for each unallocated point , if the similarity of that point to the first point in the expansion queue is at least @xmath49 , add it to the current cluster and mark it as allocated . if the shapley value of that point is at least @xmath52-multiple of @xmath54 , add it to the expansion queue .",
    "remove the first point from the expansion queue .",
    "if the expansion queue is not empty , go to step [ substart ] .",
    "if the cluster center is the only point in its cluster , mark it as noise .",
    "if all points are allocated a cluster , terminate .",
    "else go to step [ startagain ] .",
    "secondly , when the density around a point is very low as compared to the density around the cluster center of the cluster of which it is a part of , it should not be responsible for further growth of the cluster .",
    "this ensures that clusters are not merged together when they are connected with a thin bridge of points .",
    "it also ensures that the density within a cluster does not vary beyond a certain limit .",
    "we implement this idea with what we call an expansion queue .",
    "we add points to the queue only if their shapley value is at least @xmath52-multiple of that of the cluster center of the cluster of which it is a part of .",
    "the expansion queue is responsible for the growth of a cluster and it ceases once the queue is empty .",
    "the detailed and systematic steps are given in algorithm [ dracalgo ] .",
    "in this section , we qualitatively compare our algorithm with some existing related algorithms .",
    "sharpc @xcite gives a good start to k - means using a game theoretic solution concept , viz .",
    ", the shapley value . as our algorithm hierarchically allocates points to the cluster starting from a cluster center , we compare it with agglomerative clustering .",
    "the way our characteristic function and similarity function are defined , the shapley value represents density in some sense .",
    "so we compare our algorithm with the density - based ones , viz . , dbscan ( density - based spatial clustering of applications with noise ) and optics ( ordering points to identify the clustering structure ) . throughout this section , ` cluster ( @xmath56__colored marker__@xmath57 ) ' refers to the cluster marked by that colored marker in the corresponding figure .",
    "noise is represented by ( ) .",
    "figure [ sharpcfig ] shows the clusters formed by sharpc @xcite which tries to allocate clusters by enclosing points in equal - sized spheres .",
    "it can not detect clusters that are not convex .",
    "also , the cluster ( ) is a merging of three different clusters .",
    "if the threshold is increased so as to solve the second problem , more clusters are formed and the larger clusters get subdivided into several smaller clusters .",
    "agglomerative clustering , as figure [ acfig ] shows , can detect clusters of any shape and size . but owing to a constant threshold for the growth of all clusters , it faces the problem of forming several clusters in the lower right part when they should have been part of one single cluster . if the threshold is decreased so as to solve this problem , clusters ( ) and ( ) get merged .",
    "another problem is that the bridge connecting the two classes merges these into one single cluster ( ) .",
    "figure [ dbscanfig ] shows the results of dbscan @xcite .",
    "it is well known that it can not detect clusters with different densities in general .",
    "the points in the lower right part are detected as noise when intuitively , the region is dense enough to be classified as a cluster .",
    "an attempt to do so compromises the classification of clusters ( ) and ( ) as distinct .",
    "moreover , the bridge connecting the two classes merges them into one single cluster ( ) .",
    "an attempt to do the required classification leads to unnecessary subdivision of the rightmost class and more points being detected as noise .    the clustering obtained using optics @xcite is shown in figure [ opticsfig ] . unlike dbscan ,",
    "clusters ( ) and ( ) are detected as distinct .",
    "however , the points in the lower right part are detected as noise when they should have been classified as one cluster .",
    "the reachability plots for different values of _ minpts _ are such that an attempt to classify some of these points as a part of some cluster leads to the merging of clusters ( ) and ( ) . if we continue trying to get more of these points allocated , the bridge plays the role of merging the two clusters ( ) and ( ) .",
    "figure [ dracfig ] shows the clustering obtained using density - restricted agglomerative clustering ( drac ) . as cluster ( )",
    "is highly dense , its cluster center has very high shapley value resulting in a very high value of @xmath49 , the similarity threshold .",
    "no point in cluster ( ) crosses the required similarity threshold with the points in cluster ( ) , thus ensuring that the two clusters are not merged .",
    "the points in the central part of the bridge have extremely low shapley values as compared to the cluster center of cluster ( ) and so they fail to cross the shapley value threshold of having at least @xmath52-multiple of the shapley value of the cluster center .",
    "this ensures that they are not added to the expansion queue of the cluster , thus avoiding the cluster growth to extend to cluster ( ) . cluster ( ) extends to the relatively low density region because of points being added to the expansion queue owing to their sufficiently high shapley value , at least @xmath52-multiple of the shapley value of the cluster center . cluster ( ) is a low density cluster owing to the low shapley value of the cluster center and so low value of @xmath49 , the similarity threshold , thus allowing more faraway points to be a part of the cluster .",
    "cluster centers , which fail to agglomerate at least one point with their respective values of @xmath49 , are marked as noise .",
    "like other clustering algorithms , algorithm [ dracalgo ] faces some limitations . as it uses equations [ similarityfn ] and [ shapleyeq ] to compute the shapley values , the shapley value of a point changes even when a remote point is altered , which may change its cluster allocation . for the same reason ,",
    "the shapley values of the points close to the mean of the whole dataset is higher than other points even when the density around them is not as high .",
    "one solution to this problem is to take the positioning of the point into account while computing its shapley value .",
    "there is no explicit noise detection .",
    "a point is marked as noise if it is the only point in its cluster .",
    "for instance , in figure [ dracfig ] , the two points in the upper right corner are noise points , but owing to their low shapley values , @xmath49 is very low and so they are classified as a separate cluster ( ) instead .",
    "the amortized time complexity of algorithm [ dracalgo ] is @xmath58 .",
    "[ ] claim [ theorem]remark [ theorem]corollary [ theorem]definition [ theorem]conjecture [ theorem]axiom",
    "in the game as defined in section [ sec : gamemodel ] , we show in this section , that nucleolus , shapley value , gately point and @xmath0-value coincide .",
    "first , we discuss the structure of the core .",
    "the core is symmetric about a single point , which is the prime reason why the above solution concepts coincide with that very point .",

    "clearly , any point other than @xmath63 will have more distance from at least one side and so will be lexicographically greater than @xmath63 , which means that @xmath63 is the nucleolus .",
    "also , as the core is symmetric , it is intuitive that @xmath63 is the fairest of all allocations , which means that it corresponds to the shapley value imputation .",
