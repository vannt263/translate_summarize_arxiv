    "as shown in @xcite the impurity of charged dust particles changes dynamical behavior of a plasma in the low - frequency limit where heavy dust particles dominate dispersion properties .",
    "formally , the presence of an additional component increases the order of the dispersion equation and thus brings a new wave mode .",
    "one of interesting phenomena connected with the presence of dust in plasma is that due to a high inertia of dust grains such complex plasma when brought once into an anisotropic state , can then be kept anisotropic much longer than an ion - electron plasma , and therefore can develop specific anisotropic instabilities .",
    "such conditions are easily established in a magnetized dusty plasma subjected to shock waves .",
    "indeed , after crossing a shock front with parallel magnetic field a dust particle starts gyrating with the velocity @xmath2 relative to the light components ( electrons and ions ) ( see discussion e.g. in @xcite ) , where @xmath3 is the shock velocity .",
    "the longitudinal velocity component of dust particles remains however equal to the velocity dispersion of dust before the shock @xmath4 . as a rule , in these conditions",
    "the dust gyration period @xmath5 is much shorter than the dust drag time @xmath6 : @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , in the interstellar dusty plasma behind a supernova shock with @xmath8 km s@xmath9    _ cd_d~30|z|n , where the drag was assumed to be due to direct ion - dust collisions as the coulomb cross - section at these conditions is much smaller than the kinetic one , @xmath10 is the plasma ( ion ) density , @xmath11 is the grain charge : @xmath12  it can be as high as @xmath13 behind a shock with @xmath8 km s@xmath9 ; here @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the dust grain and the proton mass . unless specified , we assume through the paper the characteristic size of dust grains of @xmath18 m , though our conclusions are weakly sensitive to the actual value of @xmath19 since we consider the frequency range lower than the dust cyclotron frequency in the whole range of grain sizes . in particular , as @xmath20 the condition @xmath7 remains valid for the whole dust size spectrum ranging from @xmath21 to @xmath22 m ( for the interstellar dust properties see the review @xcite ) .",
    "it is therefore clear that the instability connected with the anisotropy of the dust component can develop succesfully on times @xmath23 provided the conditions for the instability are fulfilled . in this paper",
    "we shall describe an anisotropic instability in a plasma with isotropic electrons and ions of @xmath24 , and anisotropic dust component with the transversal orbiting velocities much higher than the longitudinal velocities @xmath25 .",
    "the paper is organized in the following fashion . in sec .",
    "ii we derive the dispersion equation for magneto - hydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves in a three - fluid plasma ; in sec .",
    "iii we analyse solutions of the disperion relation and show that low - frequency waves are unstable ; in sec .",
    "iv consequences for dust destruction behind shock waves in the interstellar medium are discussed .",
    "finally we close our paper with a short summary in sec .",
    "let us consider mhd waves in a plasma with cold dust particles gyrating with equal transversal velocities in an external magnetic field @xmath26 , in which case their distribution function is @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the transversal velocity of dust particles relative to the plasma component : @xmath28 @xmath29 for a plasma behind the shock wave moving with the velocity @xmath30 ; the wavevector is assumed to have the components @xmath31 .",
    "let us assume the phase velocity to fulfil the condition    @xmath32    where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are thermal velocities of the electrons and ions respectively . in the low - frequency limit @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the ion cyclotron frequency , the equation of mhd waves is @xcite    @xmath37    here @xmath38 are the corresponding components of the permeability . under the validity of eq .",
    "( [ con1 ] ) and the condition that the ion gyration radius is smaller than the wavelength @xmath39 the components have the form    @xmath40    where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the plasma frequencies of the electrons and ions , @xmath43 is the cyclotron frequency of the electrons , @xmath44 is the ion sound speed ; the contribution of dust into the permeability components @xmath45 and @xmath46 can be shown to be negligible .",
    "let us assume the flux of cold dust particles behind the shock front to be described by the distribution function    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the dust component density , @xmath29 as defined above ; the longitudinal motions are thus explicitly considered to be negligible as compared to the shock propagation .",
    "this distribution function corresponds therefore to the extreme anisotropy , like if the temperatures ratio was @xmath49 for maxwellian dust distributions , and from general point of view in these conditions anisotropic instabilities are always expected to grow .",
    "the component @xmath50 has the form    @xmath51    where    @xmath52,\\ ] ]    here @xmath53 , @xmath54 is the dust plasma frequency , @xmath1 , the dust cyclotron frequency .    after simple algebra in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) one arrives at    @xmath55.\\ ] ]    let us consider low - frequency electromagnetic waves with @xmath56 , and the transversal wavelength significantly longer than the gyration radius of dust particles : @xmath57 .",

    "in the lack of dust eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) describes two low - frequency electromagnetic modes present in a warm magnetized plasma : the fast and the slow magnetosound waves .",
    "indeed , when @xmath71 , eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) degenerates and converges to a biquadratic one with the two solutions corresponding to the fast and slow magnetosound waves . when @xmath72 and @xmath73 , eq .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) accounts the presence of dust in the fast and slow waves in the limit @xmath56 : the solutions are the fast and the slow waves loaded by the dust with the factor @xmath74 . for gyrating dust particles ( @xmath75 )",
    "the order of the dispersion equation increases , and a third low - frequency mode emerges caused by the interaction of gyrating dust particles with the magnetic field of the wave .",
    "it is readily seen that this low - frequency mode is always aperiodically unstable , and corresponds to the mirror instability described in @xcite .",
    "a typical value of the dust - to - gas mass ratio @xmath76 in the interstellar medium is much lower than one ( e.g. @xcite ) , and as a rule @xmath77 behind the shock front varies around one . at the same time @xmath78 is of",
    "the order of the ratio of the shock velocity to the alfvn speed and can significantly exceed one . in the limit @xmath79 the growth rate of the unstable low - frequency mode can be readily estimated asymptotically as @xmath80 , while the frequences of the wave modes are    _ 1 ^ 2=f4(1 + ) _ 2 ^ 2=2 ^ 2 .    in the opposite limit @xmath81 the solutions",
    "are    2 , for the growing mode , and    ^2=14(1+)+o(f ) , for the fast and slow modes correspondingly .",
    "the effect of dust gyration on magnetosonic waves is illustrated on figures 1 : fig .",
    "1a and 1b show the frequency of the fast wave ( a ) , and the growth rate of the third ( low - frequency ) mode ( b ) versus @xmath78 ; the slow magnetosonic mode is rather unsensitive to @xmath78 . slowly gyrating and nongyrating dust particles ( @xmath82 ) lead to a decrease of the phase velocity , which can be readely understood as due to a higher density of a dusty plasma than a dust - free plasma .    as @xmath78 grows the phase velocity increases , which is due to an enhancement of the transversal elasticity by the gyrating dust particles .",
    "indeed , the transversal dust pressure can be defined as    @xmath83    for strong shock waves , which are harmful for dust particles , @xmath84 , and the transversal pressure of dust component @xmath85 becomes comparable ( or exceeds ) to the magnetic pressure @xmath86 even though @xmath87 .",
    "2 shows the dependence of the frequency @xmath88 and the growth rate @xmath89 on plasma-@xmath77 .",
    "the phase velocity of the fast wave increases with @xmath77 due to a joint action of the magnetic and thermal pressure . at small @xmath77",
    "the slow wave does not reveal significant deviations from the slow wave in an electron - ion plasma ; deviations becomes considerable at sufficiently large @xmath77 .",
    "the growth rate of the unstable mode is rather unsensitive to the effects of the plasma thermal pressure .",
    "the mechanisms of the instability is similar to the mechanism of the mirror instability of the slow mhd wave in a plasma with anisotropic ion temperature @xmath90 . in our case , however , the isotropy of the electron and ion temperatures stabilize the slow and the fast waves , while on the other side the presence of a third cold gyrating dust component with an anisoptopic velocity distribution results in a new unstable mode . as expected",
    "the maximum of the growth rate @xmath89 is reached when the angle between the wave vector and magnetic field is @xmath91 .",
    "we have shown in this paper that the presence of an anisotropic dust in a plasma results in development of the mirror instability in the low - frequency limit @xmath56 .",
    "the instability can be important for the flows behind magnetized shock waves in the interstellar medium : here dust particles keep significant transversal component during a long time @xmath92 after crossing the shock front , and thus support development of the instability .",
    "the time of isotropization of dust grain velocities is of the order of @xmath93 , where @xmath17 is the proton mass , @xmath94 is the grain mass , @xmath95 @xmath96 , the grain cross - section , @xmath10 is plasma density ; this gives @xmath97 s for typical value of the shock velocity @xmath98 km s@xmath9 , thus resulting in @xmath99 .",
    "it is worth noting that when direct collisions between protons and dust grains dominate , @xmath100 increases when the grain radius @xmath19 decreases , such that the dust component remains anisotropic on the growth time of the instability for the whole range of grain sizes .",
    "grain - grain collisions remains unimportant in isotropization of the transversal dust velocities : indeed , the characteristic time of grain - grain collisions is of the order @xmath101 , such that @xmath102 .",
    "note that coulomb collisions between charged dust particles are inefficient because the cross - section @xmath103 @xmath96 . in principle ,",
    "fluctuations of dust charge can enhance @xmath104 ( see , e.g. discussion in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , however , they can be important only for dust grains with the charge @xmath105 , while in the conditions with the charge @xmath106 what we are actually interested in , its fluctuations can not significantly enhance @xmath104 .    as the normalized growth rate @xmath89 depends only on @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and the angle @xmath65 , the instability grows on a nearly alfvn crossing time @xmath107 ( see , fig . 1b and 2c ) . the upper limit of the wavelength for which isotropization can become important , and therefore the driving mechanism weakens and the growth rate drops , is determined from the condition @xmath108 , and is of the order @xmath109 cm . for the conditions typical behind the supernovae shocks in the interstellar medium @xmath110 km s@xmath9 , and the shock velocity @xmath98 km s@xmath9 , this saturation wavelength is @xmath111 cm .",
    "this value is approximately 3 times of the thicknes of the shell of a typical supernova remnant when its expansion velocity is @xmath8 km s@xmath9 .",
    "this means that the mirror instability induced by the anisotropy of dust velocities develops on all scales behind the shock front of a supernova remnant .",
    "as the growth rate decreases with the wavelength , the most fast growing perturbations are expected to lie in the lower end of our approximation of the low - frequency limit , i.e. on several dust gyration radii .",
    "it is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that on nonlinear stages the growing instability can form holes in the background magnetic field of several dust gyroradius in size , as observed in the experiment @xcite .",
    "from this point of view it can have great importance for dust destruction behind strong shock waves in the interstellar medium .",
    "it is commonly known that strong ( @xmath112 km s@xmath9 ) radiative supernovae shocks efficiently destroy dust grains via sputtering ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the destruction efficacy is mostly supported by betatron acceleration of the dust transversal motions @xmath113=const through the growing magnetic field in a radiatively cooling and compressing plasma : @xmath114 ; @xmath115 is the transversal momentum of a grain .",
    "this means that the destruction mechanism works efficiently only behind the fronts with a planar magnetic field . in the flows where the mirror instability operates and violates regular structure of magnetic field ,",
    "the growing magnetic holes suppress acceleration of dust grains and therefore their destruction can be reduced .",
    "the exact value of the destruction rate in such conditions depends on many factors , such as the number of magnetic holes , their sizes and magnetic field strength , their lifetime , and can be only estimated in nonlinear numerical consideration .",
    "one should also mention that dust charge fluctuations @xcite can result in acceleration / decceleration of dust particles , which in turn can affect the mirror instability .",
    "however , such effects apparently are important only when dust charge is small , close to @xmath105 . in the conditions behind strong shock waves with highly charged dust grains",
    "@xmath116 the increase of @xmath50 due to charge fluctuations , and therefore their influence on the mirror instability , seems to be small .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed stability conditions of a dusty plasma with isotropic light components ( ions and electrons ) and anisotropic dust particles , with transversal velocities much higher than velocities along the external magnetic field .",
    "we have shown that    * oblique low - frequency ( @xmath0 ) magneto - hydrodynamic waves are unstable against the mirror instability ; * this instability can be important in the interstellar dusty plasma behind strong shock waves from supernovae explosions , where the pressure of the gyrating dust particles can be comparable to the magnetic pressure behind the shock front . in these conditions the instability develops practically in the whole range of spatial scales , though the most fast growing wavelengths correspond to the lengths of several dust gyration radii ; * the instability operates to destroy regular structure of the magnetic field behind the shock front , and can reduce the destruction efficiency of the interstellar dust by shock waves .",
