    "it is known for decades that the static einstein - yang - mills theory for the gauge group su(2 ) admits regular solutions .",
    "the first example was that of bartnik and mckinnon ( bk )  @xcite .",
    "the basic idee behind this phenomenon is the balance between the attractive gravity and the repulsive yang - mills field .",
    "when a cosmological constant is incorporated in the model , the behaviour of the particle - like solution can be significant different compared to the original bk solution  @xcite .",
    "for a nice overview , see  @xcite .",
    "when the cosmological constant is negative , there are two types of generic solutions , the singular ones and the asymptotical anti - de sitter ( ads ) solutions .",
    "there is also a change of the topology of the moduli space of globally regular ( soliton ) and black hole solutions when going from negative to positive values of @xmath0 .",
    "this is called a fractal structure  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is conjectured that negative @xmath0 solutions are the only stable eym solutions and the magnetic component of the ym field need not be nodeless in order to be stable . in these models , one usually takes the pure magnetic ansatz .",
    "further , one can investigate the dyon - type solutions , where a non - zero electric component of the ym field is incorporated  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that dyon solution can exist in these models with negative @xmath0 , however under quite special asymptotic assumptions . in the present paper",
    "we investigate the eym system with positive and negative cosmological constant on a cylindrical space time , without any assumption on the asymptotic behaviour and try to find a connection between the abelian sting - like solution found on the same space time .",
    "consider the lagrangian of the su(2 ) eym system @xmath3,\\ ] ] with the ym field strength @xmath4 g the gauge coupling constant , g newton s constant , @xmath5 the gauge potential , and @xmath6 the curvature scalar .",
    "the field equations then become @xmath7 @xmath8 with @xmath9 the energy - momentum tensor @xmath10 and @xmath11 the gauge - covariant derivative , @xmath12 let us consider the stationairy exterior line element @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are functions of r. for the ym - field we will take  @xcite @xmath16 with @xmath17 and @xmath18 functions of r , and @xmath19 the orthonormal axial generators of the su(2 ) @xmath20 with n the magnetic charge . for the special case , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and n=1 , we obtain a consistent set of equations : @xmath23- \\lambda c , \\cr b''&=&\\frac{b}{4c^2}(c')^2-\\frac{2}{r } b'+\\frac{\\kappa}{bcr^2}\\bigl[\\phi^2w^2 + b^2 r^2(\\phi')^2 - 2c(w')^2\\bigr ] , \\cr ( rb\\phi')'&=&\\frac{\\phi w^2}{br } , \\cr ( \\frac{cw'}{br})'&=&-\\frac{\\phi^2 w}{br},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 . the conservation law @xmath25 is also fulfilled .",
    "further , there is a scale invariance @xmath26 with @xmath27 and @xmath28 some constant .",
    "the set of equations are easily solved numerically .",
    "we used two different fortran ode - solvers to check the reliability of the numerical solution and the maple - program as final check .",
    "for all the routine - codes we find the same solution .",
    "the absolute and relative tolerance was @xmath29 for some specific values of `` shooting''parameters , we find a remarkable solution critically dependent on the cosmological constant .",
    "let us consider near the core of the string @xmath30 : @xmath31 then we obtain for the initial values of the metric components : @xmath32 in the spherical symmetric situation (  @xcite ) the different solutions are classified by some parameters determined by the condition of the field variables at @xmath33 .",
    "here we are mainly interested in the critical situation for some initial values at @xmath30 the energy density becomes @xmath34 we observe that for the chosen initial values , @xmath35 is finite for @xmath36 .    in figure 1 and 2",
    "we plotted a typical solution for positive and negative values of @xmath0 , and for @xmath37 and for @xmath38 . for positive values of @xmath0",
    "we observe an oscillatory behaviour of the magnetic component around zero , so there are an arbitrary number of zero s . for increasing positive @xmath0 ,",
    "the frequency increases also and the solution breaks down at finite @xmath1 where c approaches zero .",
    "this means a cosmological horizon .",
    "however , for some value of @xmath0 ( for example @xmath0 around 0.004 ) the horizon is pushed to larger values of r , while the former horizon is resolved .",
    "this happens again for larger positive values of @xmath0 . in figure 3",
    "we plotted the horizon @xmath39 as function of @xmath0 . for increasing negative @xmath0",
    "we observe that the oscillation of @xmath40 slows down and disappears at a critical @xmath0 .",
    "the solution behaves like a string solution .",
    "this fact was also observed in the radiative counterpart model  @xcite . for smaller values of @xmath30 this pushing foreward of @xmath39 dissapears . in figure 4",
    "we plotted @xmath39 versus @xmath0 for @xmath41 .",

    "plot of @xmath46 for positive @xmath0 and initial values @xmath47 .",

    "this paper is a first attempt to investigate numerically the dyon solutions of the eym model with a cosmological constant on a cylindrically symmetric space time . in the numerical code",
    ", we start with regular initial values of the field variables at a small value of the core radius of the string and varied @xmath0 continuously positive as well as negative .",
    "in contrast with the spherical symmetric eym solutions with negative cosmological constant , our numerical solutions seems to be regular every where without any a priori assumption on the asymptotic behaviour .",
    "the solution behaves like a cosmic string .",
    "however further investigation is needed . for positive cosmological constant ,",
    "the numerical solutions are quite different from the spherically symmetric counterpart models .",
    "first of all , the rapid oscillatory behaviour of @xmath40 is not found in earlier studies .",
    "the classification on the number of nodes of @xmath40 makes no sense in our solution .",
