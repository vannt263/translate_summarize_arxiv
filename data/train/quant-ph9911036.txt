    "entanglement and entangled states are fundamental concepts of the new field of quantum information @xcite .",
    "they can be exploited for example in super - dense coding @xcite or teleportation @xcite both of which have been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "the most important example of entangled states is perhaps given by the four polarization - entangled bell states involving two photons @xmath0^\\dag | { \\bf 0}\\rangle \\\\    = \\frac1{\\sqrt{2}}\\big[a_{\\parallel}b_{\\parallel}\\pm a_{\\perp}b_{\\perp }   \\big]^\\dag | { \\bf 0}\\rangle\\label{bellst}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 denotes horizontal polarized and @xmath2 denotes vertical polarized photons in the two possible directions of propagation denoted by @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( see also fig . [",
    "f : setup ] ) .",
    "indeed , these states have been produced experimentally via the nonlinear process of spontaneous down - conversion @xcite . in order to actually exploit entanglement , in the manipulation of quantum information",
    "one has to be able to distinguish the different maximally entangled states given above .",
    "this ability is crucial for the unambiguous experimental realization for example of quantum teleportation @xcite , where an unknown quantum state can be exchanged between two parties as long as they share an entangled state , and perform the appropriate measurement to discriminate it among the others .",
    "a simple interferometric setup can not be of help for the discrimination among the four epr states , as it has been shown recently @xcite that a complete bell measurement can not be performed using only linear elements .",
    "a method to overcome this conclusion has been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , which , however , requires to embed the state of interest in a larger hilbert space , and therefore can be applied only in presence of multiple entanglement ( entanglement in more than two degrees of freedom ) .",
    "in this paper we consider the nonlinear interferometric setup depicted in fig . [",
    "f : setup ] .",
    "our starting point is a reliable source of optical epr - bell states , i. e. , polarization entangled photon pairs .",
    "this is usually a birefringent crystal where type - ii parametric down - conversion transforms an incoming pump photon into a pair of correlated ordinary and extraordinary photons .",
    "we assume that each pulse ( the signal ) is prepared in one of the four epr - bell states , and we want to unambiguously infer from measurements which one was actually impinging onto the apparatus .    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     which illustrates the unambiguous discrimination of the four bell states .",
    "our scheme is minimal , as it involves only two measurements , and thus only four possible outcomes , which equals the number of states to be discriminated .",
    "the fock filter is schematically depicted in fig . [",
    "the signal under examination is coupled to a high - q ring cavity by a nonlinear crystal with relevant third - order susceptibility @xmath5 , which imposes cross - kerr phase modulation .",
    "we assume that the coupling is independent of polarization , such that the evolution operator of the kerr medium is given by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the coupling constant , the @xmath3 s are the two polarization modes of the signal , and @xmath8 describes the cavity mode .",
    "( [ uk ] ) states that , as a result of the kerr interaction , the cavity mode is subjected to a phase - shift proportional to the number of photons passing through the arm of the interferometer .",
    "the ff is complemented by a further , tunable , phase - shift @xmath9 , and operates with the ring cavity fed by a strong coherent state @xmath10 , i.e. a weak laser beam provided by a stable source ( the second port of the cavity is left unexcited ) .",
    "the input state of the whole device can be written as @xmath11 , where @xmath12 denotes a generic preparation of the signal mode .",
    "the output state is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14 e^{i\\phi_n } } \\qquad \\kappa_n = \\frac{\\root\\of{1-\\tau}(e^{i\\phi_n}-1)}{1-[1-\\tau]e^{i\\phi_n } }   \\label{sk}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the overall photon - number - dependent transmitivity and reflectivity of the cavity .",
    "( [ sk ] ) @xmath15 , whereas @xmath16 denotes the transmitivity of the cavity beam splitters @xmath17 and @xmath18 . for a good cavity , ( i.e. a cavity with large quality factor )",
    "@xmath16 should be quite small , usual values achievable in quantum optical labs are about @xmath19 ( losses , due to absorption processes , are about @xmath20 ) . at the cavity output one mode",
    "is ignored , whereas the other one is monitored by an avalanche single - photon photo - detector , which checks whether or not photons are present .",
    "this kind of on / off measurement is described by a two valued pom @xmath21 @xmath22 being the quantum efficiency of the photo - detector .",
    "if the state travelling through the interferometer is either @xmath23 or @xmath24 we have @xmath25=    \\label{phiout}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the probability of having a click is given by @xmath26 whereas the conditional output signal state , after a click has been actually registered , turns out to be @xmath27 by setting @xmath28 and for @xmath29 we have @xmath30 . on the other hand , if the signal is either @xmath31 or @xmath32 we have @xmath33 and @xmath34 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac1{\\sqrt{2}}\\left [    \\pm |\\sigma^ * z\\rangle|\\kappa^ * z\\rangle|0011\\rangle\\right ]   \\label{chiout}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the second equality comes from the fact that by setting @xmath28 we have @xmath35 . finally , from eqs .",
    "( [ onoff ] ) and ( [ chiout ] ) we have @xmath36 for small @xmath37 and @xmath16 we have @xmath38 . therefore ,",
    "for @xmath39 we have @xmath40 .",
    "this means that a click at the fock filter unambiguously implies that either @xmath23 or @xmath24 was travelling through the interferometer , where having no click indicates the passage of either @xmath31 or @xmath32 .",
    "remarkably , the measurement is quite robust against detector inefficiency ( as only the product @xmath41 is relevant ) and does not destroy coherence .",
    "for both the possible outcomes ( either on or off ) the state after the measurement remains unaffected , and is still available for further manipulations .",
    "in conclusion , we have described an interferometric setup to perform a complete optical bell measurement .",
    "it consists of a mach - zehnder interferometer with the first beam splitter a polarizing one , and the second a normal one , and where inside the interferometer a non - demolition photon number measurement is performed by the fock filtering technique .",
    "the resulting scheme is robust against detectors inefficiency , and provides a reliable method to unambiguously discriminate among the four polarization - entangled epr - bell photon pairs .",
