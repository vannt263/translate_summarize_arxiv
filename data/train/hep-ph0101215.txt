    "the decay mechanism of the weak nonleptonic @xmath1 decays has motivated numerous studies @xcite- @xcite . for nonleptonic decays of @xmath4 mesons , as well as for @xmath5 s and @xmath6 s , the so called _ factorization _",
    "hypothesis has been commonly used . for nonleptonic decays ,",
    "the effective lagrangian at quark level has the form @xmath7 where the coefficients @xmath8 contain all the short distance electroweak and qcd effects to a certain order in perturbation theory , and the @xmath9 s are quark operators . typically , these quark operators are products of ( pseudo ) scalar- or vector- currents : @xmath10",
    ". then , for a nonleptonic decay @xmath11 , the factorization hypothesis ( -also called vacuum saturation approximation ) gives prescriptions of the form @xmath12 the factorization hypothesis are known to fail badly for nonleptonic @xmath5 decays @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , there are certain heavy hadron weak decays where factorization might apply .",
    "recently , the understanding of factorization for exclusive nonleptonic decays of @xmath6 mesons in terms of qcd in the heavy quark limit has been considerably improved @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will discuss nonfactorizable terms for @xmath4 decays , in particular for the decay mode @xmath13 .    even though the factorization hypothesis might work reasonably well",
    "if one is interested in an order of magnitude estimate , it does not reproduce experimental data completely .",
    "for example , a naive application of factorization in charm decays leads to rates for the @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 @xmath17 decays which are too strongly suppressed . moreover , and this is the important point of this paper : in @xmath13 , factorization misses completely , predicting a vanishing branching ratio , in contrast with the experimental situation .    to see this",
    ", note that at tree level the @xmath13 decay might occur due to two annihilation diagrams @xcite which could potentially create the @xmath18 state .",
    "however , they cancel each other by the gim mechanism",
    ". moreover , in factorization limit , the amplitude is proportional to @xmath19 in many of the studies ( e.g. @xcite ) this decay has been understood as a result of final state interactions ( fsi ) . in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite the rescattering mechanism included @xmath20 and @xmath21 states leading to a branching ratio @xmath22 @xmath23 .",
    "experimental data on the other hand are @xcite @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "a recent investigation of the @xmath26 decay mode performed in @xcite has focused on the @xmath27 channel and the @xmath28 channel one particle exchange contributions .",
    "the @xmath27 channel contribution has been taken into account through the poorly known scalar meson @xmath29 and was found to be very small , while the one particle @xmath28-exchanges yielded higher contributions , with pion exchange being the highest . in the approach of @xcite the @xmath30",
    "was realized through the scalar glueball or glue - rich scalar meson .",
    "the second instructive case concerning the factorization hypothesis , is offered by the analyses of nonleptonic @xmath5 meson decays .",
    "namely , it is well known that factorization does not work in nonleptonic @xmath5 decays . among many approaches the chiral quark model ( @xmath31qm )",
    "@xcite was shown to be able to accommodate the intriguing @xmath32 rule in @xmath33 decays , as well as cp violating parameters , by systematic involvement of the soft gluon emission forming gluon condensates and chiral loops at @xmath34 order @xcite . in the @xmath31qm @xcite , the light quarks ( @xmath35 ) couple to the would - be goldstone octet mesons ( @xmath36 ) in a chiral invariant way ,",
    "such that all effects are in principle calculable in terms of physical quantities and a few model dependent parameters , namely the quark condensate , the gluon condensate and the constituent quark mass @xcite .",
    "also in `` generalized factorization '' , it was shown @xcite that the inclusion of gluon condensates is important in order to understand the @xmath32 rule for @xmath37 decays .",
    "as the @xmath31qm approach successfully indicated the main mechanisms in @xmath33 decays , it seems worthwhile to investigate decays of charm mesons within a similar framework . however , in the case of @xmath4 meson decays one has to extend the ideas of the @xmath31qm to the sector involving a heavy quark ( @xmath38 ) using the chiral symmetry of light degrees of freedom as well as heavy quark symmetry and heavy quark effective field theory ( hqeft ) .",
    "such ideas have already been presented in previous papers @xcite and lead to the formulation of heavy - light chiral quark models ( hl@xmath31qm ) . in our formulation of the hl@xmath31qm lagrangian , an unknown coupling constant appears in the term that couples the heavy meson to a heavy and a light quark .",
    "our strategy is to relate expressions involving this coupling to physical quantities , as it is done within the @xmath31qm @xcite .",
    "we perform the bosonization by integrating out the light and heavy quarks and obtain a heavy quark symmetric chiral lagrangian involving light and heavy mesons @xcite .    because the @xmath2 ( factorizable ) contribution is zero as seen in eq .",
    ", we will try in this paper to approach to the @xmath30 decay systematically to @xmath3 .",
    "we do this by including first the nonfactorizable contributions coming from the chiral loops .",
    "these are based on the weak lagrangian corresponding to the factorizable @xmath2 terms for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "( note that the velocity @xmath41 is considered to be @xmath42 in the chiral counting ) .",
    "second , we consider the gluon condensate contributions , also of @xmath3 within the @xmath31qm and hl@xmath31qm framework . it should be noted that because the energy release in @xmath43 is of order one gev ( -in contrast to 200 mev for @xmath37 ) , the next to leading @xmath44 terms might be almost of the same size numerically compared to our @xmath3 terms .",
    "still , the amplitude of @xmath30 calculated within the framework of @xmath3 , has a reliable order of magnitude .",
    "note that we have also omitted @xmath45 terms in the framework of hqeft .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we write down the basic lagrangians including the weak lagrangian at quark level ( with special emphasis on the terms giving rise to the nonfactorizable gluon condensate contributions ) as well as the standard strong chiral lagrangians for the light and heavy meson sectors . the chiral loop contributions to the decay amplitudes are presented in section 3 .",

    "second , we can calculate the color currents contribution using the gluon condensate within the framework of the hl@xmath31qm .    treating the light pseudoscalar mesons as pseudo - goldstone bosons one obtains the usual @xmath63 chiral lagrangian @xmath64 where @xmath65 with @xmath66 containing the goldstone bosons @xmath67 ,",
