    "the parameter space , where all low energy constraints are satisfied , is most easily determined by a global statistical analysis , in which the gut scale parameters , the common gauge coupling @xmath4 , the common mass scales @xmath5 for the spin 0 and spin 1/2 sparticles , the trilinear couplings @xmath6 and yukawa couplings @xmath7 at the gut scale of the third generation of fermions , the higgs mixing parameter @xmath8 and , the ratio of vacuum expectation values of the neutral higgs doublets . ] are constrained to the low energy data by a @xmath9 minimization .",

    "the higgsinos are heavy compared to the lsp , so they hardly mix with the lsp , which is then practically a pure bino in the parameter space of interest , i.e. for lsp masses above 100 gev , since lighter lsp masses do not yield positrons in the interesting momentum range covered by the heat experiment .",
