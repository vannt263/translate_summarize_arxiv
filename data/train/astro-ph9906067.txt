    "a causality connection between molecular outflows and the optical proto - stellar jets is becoming stronger as the number of objects with a consistent set of radio , ir and optical observations has grown .",
    "high velocity co emission is seen to be correlated , kinematically and morphologically , for example , with the optical emission in the hh 111 outflow ( cernicharo & reipurth 1996 , hereafter cr96 ) . in hh 111 ,",
    "high velocity co bullets are detected far away from the optical jet and along the same flow line , which indicates that the optical jet and molecular outflow coexist spatially and probably also in time ( cr96 ) .",
    "both are manifestations of the physical processes occurring in the neighborhood of a nascent star which contribute to dissipate part of its surrounding dense material .",
    "the hh 1 - 2 system is one of the brightest herbig - haro flows , but despite various attempts an associated , collimated molecular outflow has not been clearly identified ( martn - pintado & cernicharo 1987 , hereafter mpc87 ; torrelles et al .",
    "1994 ; chernin & masson 1995 , hereafter cm95 ; choi & zhou 1997 ; correia et al . 1997 ; and see $ 3 ) .",
    "it has been suggested ( cm95 ) that the difficulty in detecting and resolving the co outflow is due to the fact that the co emission is weak and oriented almost in the plane of the sky ( @xmath7 , noriega - crespo et al .",
    "1989 ) , and confusion with the background emission is very important . the source driving the hh 1 - 2 flow is the embedded object vla 1 ( pravdo et al . 1985 ; rodriguez et al .",
    "1990 ) , which powers a highly collimated atomic / ionic jet that interacts with the surrounding medium exciting the hh 1 and 2 objects .",
    "the flow velocities of the atomic / ionic jet and hh 1 - 2 are @xmath8   ( herbig & jones 1981 ; raga et al .",
    "1990 ; reipurth et al .",
    "1993 ; eislffel et al .",
    "the similar morphology of the optical and the vibrationally excited h@xmath9 2.12   emission ( davis et al . 1994 ; noriega - crespo & garnavich 1994 ) indicates a relationship between the atomic / ionic and the molecular gas dynamics , a conclusion further supported by the measured proper motions ( noriega - crespo et al .",
    "it has been suggested ( mpc87 ) that the distribution of high density gas around hh 1 - 2 is placed along the walls of the cavity produced by the optical jet through its interaction with the ambient quiescent gas . in this letter",
    "we present high resolution and sensitivity maps of the @xmath0co and @xmath1co emission which clearly show , despite the multiple outflows around the hh 1 - 2 system , the fast and collimated co emission along the stellar jet flow axis .",
    "the observations were performed with the 30 m iram radio telescope at different runs during the 1987 - 1999 period , with a 12   spatial resolution .",
    "the final wide coverage maps were obtained in may 1998 and selected positions along the optical jet in january 1999 .",
    "three sis receivers at 3 , 2 and 1 mm were used simultaneously with receiver temperatures at 100 , 100 and 150 k , respectively .",
    "the 3 mm and 1 mm receivers were tuned to the frequencies of co , @xmath1co j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 lines respectively , while the 2 mm receiver was used to observe the j=3 - 2 line of cs ( these data will presented elsewhere ) .",
    "the spectrometers were two @xmath10 mhz filter banks , one 256@xmath11100 khz filter bank , and an autocorrelator with 2048 channels and spectral resolution of 37 khz .",
    "calibration was performed by using two absorbers at different temperatures and by deriving the atmospheric attenuation from the atmospheric emissivity . in all",
    "runs several common positions were observed to ensure calibration consistency for all data .",
    "intensity differences never exceeded 10% .",
    "a region of @xmath12 , centered on the vla 1 source , was covered .",
    "the maps are obtained by fast rastering observations with a spacing of 7 , followed by a pointing and focus check .",
    "figure 1 shows some representative co and @xmath1co spectra at selected positions along the optical jet of the hh 1 - 2 system ( position ( 0@xmath6,0@xmath6 ) corresponds to the vla 1 source ) .",
    "the maximum emission of the background cloud is at a velocity of @xmath13   in agreement with previous studies ( see , e.g. , mpc87 ; correia et al .",
    "figures 2a and 2b show the integrated intensity of the @xmath0co and @xmath1co j=2 - 1 lines for different velocity ranges .",
    "finally , figure 2c shows the superposition of the @xmath0co j=2 - 1 emission , between 11 and 11.5  ( contours ) and the [ sii ] 6717/31 optical image , covering a field of 2 .",
    "previous observations of hh 1 - 2 in @xmath0co were unable to distinguish the morphology of the outflow arising from the vla 1 source due to their limited spatial resolution ( cm95 ) .",
    "two recent studies nevertheless show evidence of a co outflow along the symmetry axis of the optical jet . in the @xmath0co @xmath14 study of correia et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the integrated intensity shows redshifted ( v@xmath15 ) and blueshifted ( v @xmath16 ) emission centered on vla 1 just as one would expect for an outflow very close to the plane of the sky .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by choi & zhou ( 1997 ) from the integrated spectrum within 20  around vla 1 of the same transition .",
    "they detected a blue wing reaching up to v @xmath17  and red wing up to v = 28 .",
    "the data presented here covers a larger field of view , with better angular resolution and sensitivity , which permit us to distinguish the presence of a low radial velocity narrowly collimated outflow along the symmetry axis of the atomic jet and the presence of high velocity gas at some positions along the jet .",
    "there is a wealth of detail in the @xmath0co and @xmath1co maps , so we will focus only on the most relevant aspects in these data in subsections 3.1 to 3.3 .",
    "the distribution of other molecular outflows in the region is briefly discussed in subsection 3.4 .",
    "figure 2a displays the @xmath0co emission at different velocity ranges in a gray scale where darker areas mean a higher intensity .",
    "these maps show that the emission between 8 and 14 around the vla 1 source is narrow .",
    "figure 2c corresponds to the integrated emission over a velocity range of 11 - 11.5 , avoiding most of the background cloud emission , that stresses the highly collimated co morphology along the optical jet flow , bounded by the optical hh 1 - 2 objects .",
    "the elongated structure seen from 4 to 8 km  s@xmath4 north of hh 1 , at around ( -40@xmath6 , 100@xmath6 ) , would be the blue - shifted counterpart of the molecular jet connecting vla 1 and hh2 .",
    "a red - shifted @xmath0co intensity enhancement from 10.5 to 14 km  s@xmath4 ( see figure 2a ) at around ( -10 , 15 ) coincides with the position and the extension of the optical jet .",
    "indeed the strongest emission corresponds to the position of a smaller working surface observed in the h@xmath9 2.12 @xmath18 m emission ( noriega - crespo et al .",
    "if the co emission is produced by the interaction of a working surface with dense material , then the redshifted emission could be a consequence of the wide velocity dispersion expected in such structures ( bhm & solf 1992 ) .",
    "in addition , the ambient medium around the jet could have a very axisymmetric distribution .",
    "the gas in front of the jet could contribute with a small column density ( the jet is visible ) , while the gas behind the optical jet ( redshifted gas ) could have larger column densities and densities .",
    "a slightly expanding cone around the jet will be seen mainly at redshifted velocities .",
    "the mass of the hh 1 - 2 low velocity molecular outflow can be estimated > from the co j=1 - 0 and j=2 - 1 line intensities .",
    "the j=2 - 1/j=1 - 0 intensity ratio ( deconvolved for the different beam sizes ) shows a clear increase from 1 in the ambient cloud to 1.4 - 1.7 along the optical jet ( i.e. not very different from that observed in hh 111 ( cr96 ) ) . if we assume a thermalised optically thin emission this ratio corresponds to a kinetic temperature of 30 k. however , due to the low velocity difference between the co ambient gas and the molecular outflow , it is difficult to separate their contributions and to estimate the mass of the molecular outflow . from a map of the total integrated intensity , which shows a clear enhancement of the co emission in the direction of the optical system (",
    "see individual panels in figure 2a and figure 2c ) , we can estimate the co integrated intensity associated with the jet by removing the background emission .",
    "we obtain an average value for w(co(2 - 1 ) ) of @xmath35 k . for a distance of 440 pc and by using the w(co)/av ratio found by cernicharo & gulin ( 1987 ) we derive a mass of 0.1 m@xmath19 for each lobe of the molecular outflow . since this mass is larger than that associated with just high velocity gas , as e.g. in hh 111 ( cr96 ) , we suspect that a low velocity component is included in our estimates , due perhaps to the walls of an expanding cavity around the optical jet ( cr96;cernicharo et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the high velocity collimated co emission associated with the outflow is observed at a low intensity level and over a narrow velocity range .",
    "it begins to show up at 10.5 - 11 , but it is only at 11 - 11.5   that it is clearly detected .",
    "this gas has not been observed in previous studies due to their limited spatial resolution and sensitivity . in hh 111",
    "the cavity walls are detected over a velocity range of @xmath3 10 - 15 km  s@xmath4 ( cr96 ) . in hh 1 - 2",
    "the range is only @xmath3 4 - 5 km / s , but if the projection angle is closer to its estimated lower limit ( @xmath20 ) then both jets have similar velocity ranges .",
    "we have made some crude estimates for the volume density and co column density from a lvg code , for the velocity range 11 - 12.5   alone and assuming t@xmath21 = 30 k , we obtain a mass of 0.025 m@xmath19 in each lobe in hh 1 -2 . taking into account that the total velocity coverage of the molecular outflow is @xmath36 - 8   the above mass estimates are in good agreement      although the hh 1 - 2 system is nearly in the plane of the sky we have found indications of high velocity gas at several positions along the optical jet .",
    "the top panel of figure 1 at ( 48@xmath6,-60@xmath6 ) , right on the hh 2 object , displays a large velocity dispersion , as a result of the strong shock experienced by the jet in this region . at ( 12@xmath6,-24@xmath6 ) a bright and extended @xmath0co red wing is clearly detected , reaching up to deprojected velocities of @xmath22 100 - 200 ( for a 5 - 10@xmath23  angle ) .",
    "this wing remains in the two following panels , at ( -12@xmath6,12@xmath6 ) and ( 0@xmath6,0@xmath6 ) , and belongs to the high velocity co gas in the jet .",
    "the jet blue wing is faint but is detected at ( -12@xmath6 , 12@xmath6 ) and ( -12@xmath6 , 24@xmath6 ) , reaching a deprojected velocity of @xmath24 kms  @xmath4 .",
    "the high velocity wings disappear in the last panel at ( -36@xmath6 , 60@xmath6 ) ahead of hh 1 .",
    "the high sensitivity data shown in figure 1 correspond to selected positions and do not cover the full spatial extent of the jet .",
    "hence , we can not determine if we are observing continuous high velocity gas along the jet or discreet bullets as in hh 111 ( cr96 ) .",
    "> from the observed @xmath0co j=2 - 1 and j=1 - 0 intensities we can estimate the mass of the high velocity gas at each position by assuming a kinetic temperature for that gas of 60 k , similar to that in other outflows .",
    "we derive masses between 1 - 5 10@xmath25   which are typical of bullets and extremely high velocity gas in young low - mass star forming regions ( bachiller et al . , 1991 ; bachiller & cernicharo 1990 ; bachiller 1996 ) . as in the case of hh 111 , the momentum and the mass associated with the high velocity gas seems to be enough to drive the low velocity gas in the cavity walls .",
    "we have searched for bullets , similar to those found in the hh 111 jet , further away of the hh objects without success .",
    "the more dense ambient medium in hh 1 - 2 when compared to hh 111 , where the jet and the bullets are emerging into a very low density gas and escaping from the cloud , makes the identification of well spatially resolved discrete emission very difficult .      at velocities between 2 to 8 km  s@xmath4 and at @xmath26   se from hh 2 there is a bright @xmath0co emission which could be due to high density molecular gas struck by the jet . a similar intensity enhancement is also detected in the @xmath1co observations ( figure 2b ) .",
    "the absence of the ambient emission in 13 at 9.5 km  s@xmath4 and at higher velocities could be interpreted precisely as the removal of the molecular gas from this region by the jet .",
    "the overall morphology seen in the @xmath1co j=2 - 1 line is very different > from the corresponding line of the main isotope . the molecular outflow seen in co ( see figures 1 and 2a ) is not detected in the @xmath1co line .",
    "we detect a blue - shifted ` clump ' ahead of hh 2 ( see panel 1 of figure 2b ) that seems to be accelerated .",
    "this suggests that the observed optical bow shocks are not the terminal working surfaces of the outflow ( ogura 1995 ) , but tracers of a more recent outburst event .",
    "if so , the clump is not the ` cloudlet ' detected in hco@xmath27(davis et al .",
    "1990 ) , but rather gas accelerated by the jet flow .",
    "another remarkable feature is the arc shape structure observed in @xmath1co at 10 - 12   arising near vla 1 ( figure 2b ) and that extends @xmath22 180   sw .",
    "this emission has been seen in other molecules ( see cernicharo 1991 ) and it could be tracing low velocity gas from a cavity seen edge - on .",
    "the arc disappears at higher velocities ( except around vla 1 ) , and its overall velocity field does not seem to be that of a rotating toroid , as suggested by marcaide et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and torrelles et al .",
    "there is an off - center filamentary structure nearly parallel to the atomic jet axis and slightly red - shifted ( see panel 3 of figure 2b ) , which extends beyond the optical knots of hh 1 , tracing perhaps the interaction of the outflow with the environment ( i.e , the cavities discussed by mpc87 ) .",
    "in addition to the molecular gas associated with hh 1 - 2 discussed above , our data also indicate the presence of several molecular outflows in the region .",
    "previous studies ( cm95 ) were not able to separate the outflow from vla 1 from the brighter and more massive vla 3 outflow",
    ". the higher resolution of our data makes this distinction possible , as it is clearly shown in figure 2a .",
    "the blue lobe , between 2 and 4 km  s@xmath4 , is found north of vla 3 , while the red lobe , from 12 to 16 km  s@xmath4 , is south .",
    "the vla 3 source is located at ( -60@xmath6 , 45@xmath6 ) with respect to vla 1 .",
    "the velocities are consistent with the ones derived by cm95 , 0 - 4.5 and 12 - 18 km  s@xmath4 for the blue and red lobe respectively .",
    "the @xmath0co j=2 - 1 observations between 10 and 16 km  s@xmath4 show an extended conical structure , with the apex close to the position of the near infrared iras 05339 - 0647 source @xmath28 ne of hh 1 and at 2  south of v380 ori .",
    "two hh objects are also found near this source , hh 147 a - b .",
    "the proper motions derived by eislffel et al .",
    "( 1994 ) show that the hh 147 outflow points towards the sw at a position angle of 230 , and away from iras 05339 - 0647 .",
    "the maps in figure 2a with velocities between 4 and 8 km  s@xmath4 present some @xmath0co j=2 - 1 emission engulfing the region around the optical hh 147 a - b objects in an elongated structure oriented sw and could correspond to the molecular counterpart . in figure 2c",
    "there is also some @xmath0co emission along the hh 144 optical flow ( reipurth et al .",
    "1993 ) and it probably represents the molecular counterpart to this outflow arising from vla 2 and oriented e - w .",
    "this @xmath0co emission outside the hh1 - 2 main axis is seen at velocities ranging from 10.5 to 12 km  s@xmath4 in figure 2a .",
    "in the hh 1 - 2 outflow the bulk of the @xmath0co gas ( @xmath29 ) is moving at deprojected velocities of 20 - 30 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "it is very likely that some of the @xmath0co emission arises from the cavity walls excavated by the jet , but there must be a contribution from the molecular jet itself .",
    "the presence of clear traces ( @xmath30 ) of high velocity molecular gas moving at 100 - 200 km  s@xmath4 reinforces this idea .",
    "there are few examples of bipolar outflows where it has been possible to observe simultaneously the high velocity molecular gas associated with the highly supersonic atomic / ionic gas .",
    "the hh 111 outflow ( cr96 ) and now the hh 1 - 2 outflow are systems where the optical jet , the warm collimated h@xmath9 gas and the high velocity @xmath0co gas are coexisting .",
    "the fact that most of the known optical jets are in the plane of the sky makes it difficult to detect their associated molecular jets .",
    "the present results and those obtained by cr96 suggest that high velocity molecular gas may be present in other optical outflows , perhaps even in the form of `` bullets '' .",
    "in addition , associated to this gas there is a low velocity molecular component along the cavity walls excavated by the supersonic atomic / ionic jet ."
