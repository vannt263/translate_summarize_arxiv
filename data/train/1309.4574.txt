    "examples are the photoionization of multi - electron atoms and molecules  @xcite , the many - body dynamics of particles in optical lattices  @xcite or quantum interference effects in mott insulators  @xcite .    from the theory side",
    "such systems pose particular challenges since quantum , spin and strong correlation effects have to be treated selfconsistently under situations far from the ground state or from thermodynamic equilibrium . among the approaches that are capable to handle such problems we mention time - dependent density functional theory and density operator methods , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "recently , the nonequilibrium green function ( negf ) approach has attracted particular attention . during the past 15 years",
    "it has been successfully applied to a variety of many - body systems in nonequilibrium , including the optical excitation of electron - hole plasmas in semiconductors  @xcite , nuclear collisions  @xcite , dynamics of laser plasmas @xcite and the problem of baryogenesis in cosmology  @xcite .",
    "more recently , negf methods have also been applied to finite spatially inhomogeneous systems , including the carrier dynamics and carrier - phonon interaction in quantum dots and quantum wells  @xcite , molecular transport in contact with leads , e.g. ,  @xcite or small atoms , e.g. ,  @xcite . for a recent overview on negf applications to inhomogeneous systems ,",

    "applications of negf methods to small hubbard clusters have been presented not long ago @xcite and showed the great potential of this method .",
    "the physical features that could be explored include the relaxation dynamics , the excitation spectrum and , in particular , the relevance of double excitations @xcite . at the same time negf simulations exhibited serious conceptual problems that are related to unphysical damping effects @xcite and computational difficulties that limited the spectral resolution and the duration of the nonequilibrium propagation",

    "_  @xcite .",
    "in order to test the quality of the second born gkba approach we concentrated on a one - dimensional ( 1d ) hubbard cluster containing just two sites and two electrons because here comparisons with available exact diagonalization methods are possible , cf .",
    "the goal of the present manuscript is to briefly discuss these results and extend them to larger systems as well as to 2d hubbard clusters and to further discuss the capabilities of the negf approach in application to hubbard nano - clusters .",
    "as outlined above , we are interested in the dynamical behavior of a finite quantum system beyond the regime of linear response . to this end",
    ", we consider a hubbard model at half - filling with hopping amplitude @xmath0 and on - site interaction @xmath1 .",
    "the initial hamiltonian , for times @xmath2 , reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 label the discrete sites , and @xmath6 indicates nearest - neighbor sites .",
    "further , @xmath7 denotes the density operator , and the energy ( time ) is measured in units of @xmath0 ( the inverse hopping rate @xmath8 ) .",
    "generally , we study the chain for open boundary conditions but this is irrelevant for the special case of two sites .    at time @xmath9 the system is strongly perturbed by an instantaneous change of the energy of site `` 0 ''  @xcite , which leads to the perturbation , @xmath10    the resulting change of the spectrum is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for the simplest case of two electrons in a two - site hubbard cluster . for @xmath11 and arbitrary real values of the parameter @xmath12",
    ", the perturbed system @xmath13 will initially show a depopulation of the site @xmath14 followed by an accumulation of density on the second .",
    "subsequently , also the density on the remaining site(s ) will change with time and , finally , all occupations will start to oscillate . in the case of @xmath15 ,",
    "the population change is expected to be small , such that the dynamics should be well characterized by the linear response properties of the chain . for @xmath16",
    ", however , we expect nonlinear effects to become crucial .    to verify these qualitative predictions for the time dynamics , a computational study is indispensable . as a reliable theoretical tool we will use nonequilibrium green functions theory which we briefly outline in the following section .",
    "to describe the electron dynamics of the hubbard nano - cluster following the rapid change of the hamiltonian , the central quantity is the one - particle nonequilibrium green function defined on the complex keldysh contour @xmath17 , e.g. , @xcite , @xmath18 with the site indices @xmath4 , @xmath5 and the spin projection @xmath19 which attains the values @xmath20 ( we assume that there are no spin - dependent contributions to the hamiltonian ) . here and below we use atomic units with @xmath21 .",
    "further , the operator @xmath22 accounts for contour ordering of the times @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and @xmath25 means averaging in the grand canonical ensemble . from the negf all relevant observables can be computed . in particular",
    ", the density matrix follows from the time - diagonal components , @xmath26 . in the site - diagonal case",
    "this quantity contains the expectation value of the density operator , @xmath27 introduced above whereas the off - diagonal elements are related to transition amplitudes between different sites . in a similar manner the negf yields probability currents , mean energies and other relevant quantities , e.g. , @xcite . due to the two - time dependence of the green function ,",
    "a systematic treatment of dynamic correlation effects is possible where interactions , quantum and spin effects as well as coupling to a ( possibly strong ) external field is properly taken into account .",
    "the negf formalism provides the basis for a theory that maintains the conservation laws @xcite and allows for a systematic construction of approximations via feynman diagrams .",
    "let us now consider the equations of motion for the nonequilibrium green functions ( [ gdef])the keldysh - kadanoff - baym equations ( kbe )  @xcite , @xmath28 where @xmath29 simultaneously obeys the adjoint equation with @xmath30 , and summation over the repeated site index @xmath31 is implied on the left and right sides .",

    "( [ kbe ] ) , the time arguments are defined on the keldysh contour meaning that the functions @xmath29 and @xmath35 possess an internal matrix structure depending on how the time arguments are positioned on the contour @xmath17 , for details see ref .",
    "@xcite . for the following it is sufficient to note that the simulations yield , among others , the correlation functions @xmath36 which determine all relevant time - dependent observables , as discussed above .",
    "the kbe are  in principle",
    " exact equations of motion of the many - body system would the selfenergy be exactly known .",
    "this is the case only for a limited number of models . in general , therefore , one has to resort to many - body approximations for the self - energy . due to the existence of diagram expansions ,",
    "this can be done in a systematic and conserving way with the remarkable property that the approximations remain fully valid in nonequilibrium , including slow and rapid processes as well as weak and strong excitation .",
    "the simplest approximation is the hartree - fock ( hf ) approximation where correlations are neglected entirely .",
    "it is commonly expected that this is a reasonable approximation for weak coupling , i.e. , in the present case , for @xmath37 .",
    "nevertheless , we will see below that even for small @xmath1 , in some nonequilibrium situations correlation effects may play a crucial role , in particular , for the long - time behavior . among the higher order selfenergies we mention the second(-order )",
    "born ( 2b ) , gw or t - matrix approximations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus on the second order born approximation . for the treatment of hubbard nano - clusters in higher order approximations we refer to ref .",

    "the solution of the kbe ( [ kbe ] ) is now routine , e.g. , @xcite and references therein . after preparing a correlated initial state e.g. ,",
    "@xcite the system is propagated in the two - time plane by computing the negf as a function of both time arguments . due to the time - memory structure of the collision integral in eq .",
    "( [ kbe ] ) the negf at all times and for all values of the site and spin indices has to be stored in memory @xcite . here",
    "substantial advances could be recently achieved via sophisticated program structure and parallelization  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the computational requirements for the kbe solutions exhibit an unfavorable cubic scaling with time @xcite .",
    "clearly , this limits the duration of propagation in nonequilibrium as well as the accuracy and resolution of the computed energy spectra that are obtained from a fourier transform ( time integral over the whole simulation ) .    to overcome this limitation ,",
    "we have recently developed solutions of the kbe in the single - time limit .",
    "this is achieved by applying the generalized kadanoff baym ansatz ( gkba )  @xcite , where the two - time functions appearing in the collision integral of eq .",

    "we emphasize that the reconstruction of the greater and lesser components of the green function with real @xmath23 and @xmath24 is sufficient as long as the method of adiabatic switching is applied to generate the correlated initial ( ground ) state by time propagation , for details see @xcite .",
    "the quality of the gkba has been tested before for macroscopic spatially homogeneous systems @xcite .",
    "there it was found that the gkba retains the conservation laws of the original two - time approximation for the selfenergy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was found that this ansatz is a very good approximation to the full two - time solution if the exact propagators @xmath45 are being used and the results remain satisfactory with the hartree - fock propagators @xcite .",
    "the use of damped propagators that include imaginary selfenergy contributions , on the other hand , violates total energy conservation and leads to an overall worse performance @xcite .",
    "our recent results for lattice systems confirm these observations and indicate that the second born - gkba ( 2b - gkba ) with hf propagators provides an excellent description of hubbard nano - clusters up to moderate couplings of the order @xmath46 .",
    "we underline that the scaling with the simulation time @xmath47 was found to improve to @xmath48 @xcite  a noticeable gain for the desired long relaxation studies compared to full two - time simulations .",
    "we now apply our negf results within the 2b - gkba approximation to the nonlinear excitation of a small hubbard cluster . in the following ,",

    "the dynamics of the system for @xmath11 is therefore , @xmath86 with @xmath87 being the eigenstates of @xmath80 ( having energy @xmath88 ) and @xmath89 denoting the expansion coefficients with respect to the ground state @xmath90 of @xmath52 .",
    "moreover , it is easily shown  @xcite that the excited state @xmath83 is a doubly - excited state relative to the ground state @xmath81 , whereas the states @xmath84 and @xmath82 are singly - excited states . with the same argument",
    ", state @xmath83 is furthermore also a doubly - excited state relative to the ground state ( gs ) of @xmath52 .",
    "we note that , in the negf formalism we do not have direct access to the @xmath91-particle states , nevertheless the characteristic frequencies are captured by the spectra ( spectral function , propagators ) or the associated time dynamics of the relevant observables such as the site occupation .",
    "thus it is obvious that the peaks in the fourier transform of the density response , cf .",
    "fig  [ fig3 ] , should within the approximation coincide with the transitions in @xmath33 .",
    "indeed , we find the approximations of the transitions @xmath92 , @xmath93 in the upper part of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and of @xmath94 in the lower part .",
    "let us now analyze the role of correlation effects .",
    "this can be easily done by turning off correlations in the negf scheme entirely by neglecting the collision integral , i.e. , by retaining in the selfenergy only the time - diagonal hartree - fock contribution .",
    "the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] by the ( blue ) squares .",
    "the analysis shows that the transition with the highest energy difference @xmath95 is missing in the hf solution because double excitations are generally not included in any time - dependent hartree - fock calculation  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the two transitions @xmath96 and @xmath97 are of one - electron character , however , only the transition @xmath96 is observed .",
    "the reason is that the function @xmath58combined with the excitation ( [ h1])only probes energy differences between states that are populated already at time @xmath51 .",
    "as mentioned above , however , the state @xmath83 is never populated in hf .",
    "for this reason , the splitting of the low energy peak around @xmath98 observed in the 2b - gkba simulations , cf .",
    "[ fig3 ] , is completely missing in a hf simulation .",
    "inspection of the hf curves in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows , besides the curve corresponding to the transition @xmath96 , a second line close to the second born transition @xmath95 .",
    "this appears to be in conflict with the analysis of double excitations given above .",
    "however , there is a simple explanation : by performing a linear fit to the two hf frequencies we obtain @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "this means , the observed frequency around @xmath94 is just the second harmonics of the frequency @xmath92 .",
    "in contrast to the hf approximation , negf - simulations with second - order self - energy are able to reproduce double excitations , as was shown in refs .  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the present 2b+gkba calculations capture the transition @xmath94 and , accordingly , also @xmath93 .",
    "the fact that the transition @xmath95 is not the second harmonic of @xmath96 , as in the hf case , is readily verified by making an analogous linear fit through the simulation points with the result @xcite @xmath101 .",
    "the difference between @xmath102 and the second harmonic of @xmath103 grows with @xmath1 as @xmath104 .",
    "finally , we note that our 2b+gkba simulations reveal also another feature of small hubbard clusters  the possibility of finite double occupations of a given site .",
    "the corresponding time - dependent results are included in the lower part of fig .",
    "the dynamics of the double occupation @xmath105 was computed according to the formula @xcite @xmath106_{ii}$ ] , which is essentially the diagonal element of the two - particle correlation function .",
    "we observe a similar oscillatory time - dependence as for the single occupations ( upper part of the figure ) .",
    "the carrier frequency ( highest frequency ) is the same in both quantities .",
    "however , the oscillations of the double occupations are much less modulated , except for the already mentioned slight violation of positivity .",
    "apart from this , the results are in good agreement with the exact data .",
    "thus , our second order born ( 2b+gkba ) results give a correct picture of the main features of the spectrum of the two - site hubbard cluster , even in the case of strong nonlinear excitation .",
    "obviously , the treatment of correlations on this level is only an approximation , and we should expect increasing deviations for growing @xmath1 .",
    "this can be clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where we included also results from exact diagonalization ( full black lines ) . while the two lower frequencies @xmath92 and @xmath93 are very well reproduced by 2b+gkba , the upper mode @xmath94 is only rather accurate for @xmath107 .",
    "additionally , it is obvious that it exhibits an incorrect slope with @xmath1 : while the exact result shows an increase of the frequency with @xmath1 the born approximation yields a decrease @xcite . to reproduce the correct behavior ,",
    "obviously , higher order correlation contributions are essential .",
    "this paper was devoted to hubbard nano - clusters  finite lattice systems of electrons that are well suited to study correlation effects in quantum systems in combination with out - of - equilibrium behavior following an external excitation .",
    "here we concentrated on the dynamics of the system triggered by imposing a strong external potential at time @xmath51 , which results in a pronounced nonequilibrium particle distribution across the sites .",
    "a similar scenario , where both electrons were artificially placed on the same site initially , was studied before using negf @xcite in order to test the method and different approximations .",
