    "the q0957 system is the first identified multiply imaged quasar ( walsh , carswell , and weymann , 1979 , ) and the first to have a measured time delay ( schild and cholfin , 1986 ) .",
    "it is also the first in which a microlensing event was detected ( grieger , kayser & refsdal 1988 ) .",
    "subsequent decades have produced refinement of the models that describe the lensing and the many observational parameters required to turn the physical configuration into an important cosmological tool .    along this path ,",
    "the biggest surprise was the observation that the system seems to show a rapid microlensing of low amplitude ( schild and smith 1991 ; schild 1996 ) .",
    "if confirmed , this would have important implications for the nature of the dark matter , since solar mass objects in lens galaxy g1 should have a microlensing time scale of 30 years .",
    "it would also have implications for the existence of fine structure in the luminous structure of the source quasar .",
    "unfortunately the observational tests for this reported fine structure require high photometric precision and an accurate value of the time delay .",
    "worse , an investigation by colley and schild ( 2000 ) in which the quasar was intensively observed throughout 5 nights in 1994.9 and again in 1996.1 showed that from one observatory one can not easily measure the time delay to better than a day , because all but the most sophisticated statistics would favor a delay where there is no data overlap between the a and delayed b images , namely when the time delay in an integer number of days plus a half day ( the sun is up in either the a or later b data ) . furthermore , because of this , it is virtually impossible to assess whether or not there is microlensing on a timescale of a day or less .",
    "but there is good news ; the quasar was demonstrated to show brightness fluctuations of order 1 percent in a night .    therefore , to serve two purposes , a precise determination of the time delay and a detection of rapid microlensing , an observing campaign enlisting 10 observatories undertook continuous monitoring of the quasar images on the nights of 20 - 29 jan , 2000 .",
    "the present manuscript describes the observations and results of the first year of observing , the image a component of which becomes the prediction for the image b light curve for the coming session in 12 - 21 march , 2001 , if there is no microlensing .",
    "to create a continuous brightness record for q0957 + 561a , b , observations from northern hemisphere observatories would be required during their winter months .",
    "thus , poor weather would be likely at any site , and some redundancy would be necessary to avoid significant gaps in the data record .",
    "we tried to get at least 2 participating observatories in differing weather zones for any ut hour of the program .",
    "each observatory is presumed to provide about 8 hours of coverage , which allows for substantial overlap in coverage from eastern asia to western europe , and even into north america , though the pacific is singly covered by mt .",
    "hopkins ( arizona ) and south korea .    our list of participating observatories is given in table  [ obstab ] , where successive columns give the observatory name , telescope aperture , altitude , latitude , and longitude , and the pixel scale of the ccd camera .",
    "observers were instructed to begin and end the observational session with an r filter , and to do about 15% of the observing through the night at v. the v data have not yet been reduced .",
    "data were reduced following standard procedures and the precepts of colley and schild ( 2000 ) . with data from many observatories available , a standardized header file and byte order had to be established , and the data were bias subtracted and flat fielded with idl software .",
    "simple aperture photometry , with aperture diameters of six arcseconds , was then carried out on all image frames .    because the plate scales and ccd sizes of the several observatories varied significantly , it was not possible to use exactly the same standards for all data frames .",
    "the data frames from maidanak , for instance , contain only one of the usual standards ( star 5 from schild & cholfin 1986 ) .",
    "therefore , each of the observatories datasets is calibrated independently , by the honeycutt ( 1992 ) method for ensemble photometry .    during the aperture photometry ,",
    "the fwhm seeing is calculated by using a best - fit moffat ( @xmath0 ) profile , which allows for ellipticity and rotation .",
    "running hourly averages are computed for the image a and b photometry from each observatory . subtracting this average from the individual photometric measurements from each image",
    "gives a deviation as a function of seeing .",
    "seeing is expected to introduce correlated errors in the photometry , slightly more in a than in b ( e.g. colley & schild 1998 ) .",
    "we find exactly that behavior here , but to a differing degree from each observatory .",
    "a parabola accurately reproduces the behavior of the deviation from the hourly average vs. the log of fwhm seeing .",
    "a `` fixed '' version of the photometry can be created by subtracting this behavior out for each photometric datum .",
    "our r filter brightness curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , with hourly averages of data from each observatory .",
    "overplotted is the `` snake '' from the press , rybicki , and hewitt ( 1992 ) method to average and interpolate time - series observations .",
    "we explicitly use the structure function determined in colley and schild ( 2000 ) for the interpolation .",
    "the resultant curve is useful for our talking and planning purposes , but the original hourly averages with errorbars will be used in the final cross - correlation when the second year s data are available .    in combining data from several observatories we had to make adjustments , or zero - point shifts , for each observatory .",
    "although the quasar brightness is always measured relative to the standard stars , the standards are all redder than the quasar and a small correction to the standard kron - cousins r filter system is required .",
    "such a correction is required for the mt .",
    "hopkins system as well , and in practice we have determined the correction relative to the mt hopkins filter / ccd response .    we have determined the zero - point correction by two methods . in the first , the measured standard star brightness is averaged for all data frames from a particular observatory , and the average observed brightnesses compared to the standard values plotted as a function of color of the standards .",
    "this gives a standard curve that can be extrapolated to the colors of the quasar images to derive the correction to the observatory s zero point .",
    "this is a normal procedure in transforming photometry to a standard system , and we have employed what is often referred to as first order transformation coefficients .",
    "the amplitude of the correction is ordinarily a few hundredths of a magnitude .",
    "for example , the correction for the mt hopkins data is 0.04 mag .    in a second procedure ,",
    "a running hourly average of the `` fixed '' data was computed for each observatory .",
    "we then generated the press , rybicki & hewitt ( 1992 ) `` snake '' for all observatories except one , and computed the optimum ( in the weighted least - squares sense ) offset between the snake and the photometry from the remaining observatory .",
    "rotating through all the various observatories , offsetting , then iterating , quickly produces optimum offsets that minimize the differences in the photometry measured from all of the observatories .",
    "the first and second methods produce similar results , but the first , of course , generates an offset to be applied simultaneously to the a and b image data . the offsets , however , would not necessarily be identical , because the lens galaxy contributes a very red component to the very blue qso images in very different amounts , a to b. this is troublesome , because one likely culprit for non - zero photometric offsets in the first place is differences in filters and detector responses .",
    "so , in our second , more empirical method , we allowed the image a and image b offsets to be determined independently .",
    "the good news is that while the offsets ranged over a tenth of a magnitude , they generally agreed between a and b to better than 1% , for all except wise and boao data . furthermore , the offsets from the transformation coefficients agreed with the second , empirical method with an r.m.s . of 6 millimagnitudes ( again excluding wise and boao ) .",
    "the wise and boao offsets agree more poorly because both of those observatories contributed principally in one night , and in both cases , showed substantial variation ( of order a few percent ) .",
    "these larger variations confuse the offset optimization ( in a way that is complementary to the problem that a lack of variations to confuse time delay estimates ) .",
    "we have chosen simply to stay with the second method ( snake residual minimization ) , for the simple reason that it is the more straight - forward of the two , and we invite those interested in such nuances to consult our full data table .",
    "we have then the problem that we have data of non - uniform quality , in non - uniform pass - bands , zero - pointed by non - uniform standards , none of which has a spectrum similar to our object , and none of which is even as blue as our object .",
    "we found , however , that by examining the colors of the standards , we could generate approximate offsets that agree quite well with completely empirical offsets , and that the offsets themselves are quite consistent between the a and b images at a single observatory .",
    "we therefore adopt this empirical method as our best procedure for determining offsets .",
    "we are pleased that our image a brightness curve shows some brightness fluctuations that can be sought in our forthcoming second season of observing .",
    "relative to simple weighted mean for the entire data record , we found that the @xmath1 value is greater than 20,000 for 296 degrees of freedom for both a and b images .",
    "the non - uniformity of the data makes such a direct calculation assumptive , so we also computed this @xmath1 value for the mt .",
    "hopkins data , alone , in which we found values of greater than 1000 for 93 degrees of freedom . while this is certainly not a detailed statistical treatment , our previous work ( colley & schild 1999 ) showed that our errorbars on mt .",
    "hopkins data were quite reliable , and we therefore have confidence that this measurement shows siginificant departures from constant .",
    "furthermore , the complex pattern of brightness fluctuations seen around @xmath2 = 2569  2572 is fairly well defined by observations and an even larger , though more poorly constrained , drop is evident at 2565.3 .",
    "this latter feature is well sampled from observations in korea , but we remain cautious , because the drop occurs simultaneously in both images , which seems unlikely .",
    "we have checked the data with another software program ( iraf ) and find no fault with the reductions . if the feature is real , it gives an important feature to be sought near the beginning of the observational period now being planned .",
    "if this feature can be identified on 12 march 2001 , determination of a time delay to less than an hour should be possible .",
