    "to model a gas cloud in hydrostatic equilibrium we make the simplified assumption that the gas pressure consists of the sum of thermal ( subscript `` th '' ) , turbulent wave ( `` w '' ) , and magnetic ( `` m '' ) pressure components , @xmath0 we compute the thermal pressure through a detailed thermal equilibrium calculation , but the wave and magnetic pressures are assumed to obey a polytropic equation of state , @xmath1 i.e. the pressure only depends on density , and @xmath2 , the polytropic exponent , is constant in a given object . given the thermal and non - thermal gas pressure , it is possible to construct hydrostatic equilibria for any surface pressure and central to surface density contrast .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry for simplicity .    whether a given hydrostatic equilibrium model cloud is gravitationally stable depends on its response to perturbations in pressure or density .",
    "different equations of state apply for such perturbations .",
    "for example , if the perturbation occurred on a time scale shorter than the cooling time , the scaling of the thermal pressure with density would be stiffer than if the perturbation would be allowed to reach thermal equilibrium . to analyze the stability we make the simple assumption that the perturbation obeys a polytropic equation of state , but with some different `` adiabatic index '' , @xmath3 : @xmath4 where @xmath5 are infinitesimal perturbations , and the subscript `` 0 '' refers to values before the perturbation .",
    "a hydrostatic equilibrium cloud is stable against spontaneous contraction or expansion when at any point in the cloud , the pressure increases during a compression or decreases during an expansion , i.e. , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the radius from the cloud center .",
    "marginally stable equilibria have @xmath8 at some point in the cloud .     observed column densities of prestellar cores ( _ symbols _ ) and upper limits for stable equilibria ( _ lines _ ) .",
    "the lower line applies for pure thermal support , the one above for an equal thermal and magnetic pressure in the cloud center , the one above that for equal thermal and turbulent , the top one for equal thermal , magnetic and turbulent pressures in the cloud center .",
    "_ dotted lines _ connect independent measurements of the same object by different authors . ]      at any radial point in the cloud we solve the coupled thermal balance for the gas and dust .",
    "we adopt the gas heating and cooling rates and thermal gas - dust coupling from goldsmith @xcite , and the dust heating and cooling rates for the solar neighborhood from zucconi et al . @xcite .",
    "the heating is due to cosmic rays and the interstellar radiation field , for which we allow some shielding , @xmath9 , due to the material surrounding the core .",
    "when analyzing the stability , we assume that the heating or cooling due to a perturbation is negligible .",
    "the heating and cooling rates themselves however change , as they depend on the perturbed density and visual extinction .",
    "we treat the kinetic pressure due to non - thermal motions , which we call turbulence , in the very simplifying framework of alfvn waves .",
    "the pressure due to alfvn waves can be described by a polytropic exponent @xmath10 , and an adiabatic exponent @xmath11 for the case where no energy flow occurs @xcite .",
    "if we allow for a flow of the turbulent energy between the core and its surroundings during perturbations , then the adiabatic exponent would be equal to the polytropic one , i.e. @xmath12 .",
    "this requires that the heat flows are faster than the duration of the perturbation .    the magnetic pressure due to the average magnetic flux threading the cloud depends on the distribution of field lines in the cloud , which is a result of how the cloud has formed while the gas was frozen to the field lines .",
    "a somewhat more realistic case was adopted for the 2-dimensional hydrostatic equilibria computed by tomisaka et al.@xcite : here a cloud was assumed to initially have been spherical and at uniform density within a uniform magnetic field .",
    "we examined these 2-d equilibria to determine the magnetic field ",
    "density scaling , finding @xmath13 . the magnetic adiabatic exponent adopted in our work , @xmath14 ,",
    "is chosen such that the critical density contrasts of tomisaka et al.@xcite are reproduced .",
    "we adopt these values for our idealizing spherical model to study the behavior of 2-d magnetized equilibria .",
    "in our yet preliminary study we have looked at clouds with a particular ratio between the non - thermal and thermal pressure _ at the cloud center : _ we investigated clouds with @xmath15 or 1 , and with @xmath16 or 1 , which is meant to give a first impression on the effect of non - thermal pressure support on the cloud stability .",
    "we adopt an extinction due to material surrounding the clouds of 5 magnitudes in the visual .    as a function of cloud mass we computed the maximum central column density for a stable hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "these are plotted in figure [ fig:1 ] for clouds with and without non - thermal pressure .",
    "a comparison with the column densities measured for all starless low - mass cores we found in the literature shows that some of the more massive cores have column densities which are larger than what could be accounted for by a stable cloud with pure thermal pressure support .    with a magnetic or turbulent pressure at least comparable to the thermal pressure in the cloud center , higher central condensations comparable to those observed would be possible for stable clouds .",
    "if this non - thermal pressure were due to turbulent motions , then the observed cores non - thermal velocity dispersions should be comparable to the sound speed , but observations typically show smaller non - thermal linewidths @xcite .",
    "thus turbulence is unlikely to be the dominant support in such cores , and magnetic fields remain as the stabilizing force .",
    "a second argument for the need of non - thermal support in the more massive low - mass cores derives from their maximum possible surface pressure .",
    "a core of given mass in a stable hydrostatic equilibrium can only exist if the kinetic surface pressure due to thermal and turbulent particle motions is below some critical value .",
    "significant non - thermal pressure is necessary to stabilize the more massive cores ( @xmath17 ) in such environments .    to summarize ,",
    "our preliminary analysis of the stability of dense , self - gravitating cores and our comparison with observed cores and their environments suggests the need for non - thermal pressure support , most likely provided by magnetic fields of less than @xmath18 .",
