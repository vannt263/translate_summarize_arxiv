    "when sufficiently large waves propagate through a medium , non - linear interactions cause an energy transfer between different scales ; the energy that is introduced typically in a narrow band of wavelength is redistributed to waves of different wavelengths . starting in the 1960s with oceanographers and meteorologists , ` weak wave turbulence '",
    "has now become a standard theory to explain the dynamical and statistical properties of an ensemble of weakly nonlinear interacting waves  @xcite .",
    "thanks to the generality of its formulation , this theory is an interdisciplinary subject ; it has been implemented in situations ranging from alfvn waves in solar winds , ocean swells on a stormy sea , quantum waves in bose - einstein condensates , rossby waves in the atmospheres of rotating planets as well as in the thunder - like sound produced by vibrating thin elastic sheets , etc .",
    "up - to - date discussions of the current state of wave turbulence are available for example in a recent book  @xcite and in reviews  @xcite ; these sources also contain extensive lists of references .",
    "quantum turbulence is the study of turbulent behavior in zero temperature superfluids such as helium ii  @xcite .",
    "one of the key properties of quantum turbulence is that it comprises of an inviscid flow which permits energy to reach scales far smaller than achieved in classical turbulence . at large scales ,",
    "quantum turbulence shows a great similarity to classical turbulence - with the polarization of vortex bundles acting like large scale eddies .",
    "however , at small scales the analogy begins to break down . in the absence of viscosity in superfluids and at very low temperatures where",
    "thermal excitations ( mutual friction ) can be neglected , there is no clear dissipation mechanism that cuts off the energy cascade to very small lengthscales .",
    "therefore , unlike in classical turbulence where viscous effects dissipate the energy , it is believed that for superfluids the energy is transferred to propagating waves on quantized vortex lines that are forced by vortex reconnections . note that these so - called `` kelvin waves '' were originally introduced in  1880 in the context of the classical rankine vortex model  @xcite .",
    "the kelvin waves then interact allowing for energy to be transferred to higher frequency kelvin waves until the wave frequency is sufficient for the excitation of phonons and thus the degradation of energy into heat  @xcite .",
    "because of its importance in superfluid turbulence and the growing experimental capabilities in this field  @xcite , there has recently been a renewed interest in the statistical physics of waves propagating on a vortex line  @xcite .",
    "a complete understanding of the statistical behavior of kelvin waves is therefore crucial in order to develop a theory of superfluid turbulence . until recently ,",
    "kelvin wave interactions were thought to be a local process - only kelvin waves of similar wave numbers interact with each other thus forming the range of a local energy cascade  @xcite .",
    "the kelvin wave cascade was described using wave turbulence theory  @xcite for weakly interacting waves , resulting in the formation of a kinetic wave equation describing @xmath0 kelvin wave interactions  @xcite . however in ref .",
    "@xcite , the locality assumption used in ref .",
    "@xcite was checked and was shown to be violated for local @xmath0 kelvin wave interactions .",
    "this invalidated the local theory , and a non - local theory was proposed  @xcite resulting in @xmath1 kelvin wave interactions .",
    "this has prompted a lively debate about the correct spectrum of kelvin waves  @xcite .",
    "it is now recognized that the typical turbulent state of a superfluid consists of a complex tangle of quantized vortex lines  @xcite which can be modelled by the biot - savart equation  @xcite @xmath2 this equation contains a singularity as @xmath3 , and hence the model are postulated by introducing a cut - off in the integration : @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is interpreted as the core radius of the vortices @xcite . here , @xmath6 is the quantum of circulation with @xmath7 being @xmath8 , mass of @xmath9he atom ( if the superfluid is @xmath10he then @xmath7 is the mass of two atoms , 2@xmath11 ) .",
    "an important step in studying kelvin wave turbulence was done by sonin  @xcite and later by svistunov  @xcite who found a hamiltonian form of the biot - savart eq .",
    "( [ biot - savart equation ] ) for a straight vortex line aligned in the @xmath12 direction , e.g. line @xmath13 . perturbing the line by small disturbances in the @xmath14-plane ,    [ eq : hamsys ]",

    "@xmath19 \" denotes complex conjugation .",
    "the hamiltonian for the biot - savart equation @xmath20 is the energy of the system @xcite : @xmath21 here we have used the notation @xmath22 .",
    "like in most of the examples of wave turbulence mentioned in the introduction , the theory for kelvin waves starts by writing down a hamiltonian equation for the complex canonical wave amplitudes  @xmath23 and  @xmath24 which are classical analogs of the creation and annihilation bose operators in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "consider an isolated straight vortex line on a periodic domain of length @xmath25 .",
    "one can write @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "the new hamiltonian @xmath28 is the density of the old one and is a function of all @xmath29 and @xmath30 taken at the same time .    for small kelvin wave amplitudes ( inclination angles )",
    "the hamiltonian can be expanded with respect of @xmath31 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath20 , eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) , dictates an expansion of @xmath32 in @xmath33 and @xmath34 with even powers only ,    @xmath35    the first term @xmath36 describes free propagation of kelvin waves with a frequency @xmath37 . in turn",
    ", @xmath38 should be expanded in inverse powers of the large parameter @xmath39 : @xmath40 here @xmath41 is the vortex line diameter and  @xmath42 is the mean inter - vortex distance at which the description of kelvin waves propagating along an individual vortex line fails . in typical experiments @xmath39 , in both @xmath10he and @xmath9he , is between 12 and 15 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown  @xcite that the leading approximation in @xmath39 gives no energy exchange between kelvin waves and therefore one has to account in @xmath32 for subleading terms , zero order in @xmath39 , denoted by the superscript  @xmath43 \" .",
    "the higher order expansion terms in @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 , describe @xmath47 and @xmath0 scattering of kelvin waves : @xmath48    equations for the terms of order @xmath49 and @xmath50 in the interaction amplitudes @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( denoted as @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) were found in ref .",
    "@xcite and later confirmed in ref .",
    ".    on the face of it , the leading term in @xmath55 ( i.e. @xmath56 ) describes a @xmath57 scattering ; the subleasing term , @xmath58 , is responsible for the @xmath59 scattering .",
    "it was argued , however , that the @xmath57 scattering can not redistribute energy between different scales .",
    "therefore the @xmath59 scattering becomes the leading interaction responsible for the inter - scale energy transfers .",
    "this does not mean , however , that the @xmath56 hamiltonian can be completely disregarded . instead , as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , ineffective hamiltonian ( in our case @xmath56 ) can be eliminated from the problem by a proper non - linear canonical transformation @xmath60 .",
    "this comes at a price of the appearance of  correction terms \" in the 6-wave mixing amplitude ( which we have denoted with a calligraphic vertex @xmath61 , different from @xmath62 ) in the hamiltonian @xmath63 :      the 72 additional contributions are schematically indicated as @xmath66 since the exact expression is too long to be written here ( one can handle them with a symbolic computation software such as _ mathematica _ ) .",
    "one observes that , on the one hand , they are 6-wave mixing terms , but due to their internal structure they can also be understood as the pairs of 4-wave mixing amplitudes ( mediated by a green s function @xmath67 ) . in the graph shown in , with incoming wave vectors",
    "@xmath68 starting from above and outgoing wave vectors @xmath69 , the frequency @xmath70 .",
    "the 72 contributions of the type shown in differ by the directions of the arrows and by relabeling in @xmath68 and @xmath69 groups .",
    "this understanding provides us with an effective 6-wave mixing , allowing one to use standard procedure  @xcite for the statistical description of weak turbulence of kelvin waves .",
    "it is based on the assumption that the turbulent dynamics of waves with small enough amplitude is chaotic and creates its own ergodic measure .",
    "the simplifying nature of weak wave turbulence is that , due to the existence of a small parameter , the statistical description closes upon itself in terms of the pair correlation function    [ ke ] @xmath71 which is also called the  wave action \" .",
    "hereafter the pointed brackets stand for an average over the ergodic measure .",
    "the aim of the theory is to analyze the solutions of the kinetic equation of motion which is typically expressed as @xmath72    where term @xmath73 is so - called collision integral with an integrand proportional to the square of the effective interaction amplitude @xmath61 .",
    "this term is a function of @xmath74 and a functional of  @xmath75  @xcite .",
    "the main part of the kelvin wave energy @xmath76 in the regime of weak wave turbulence is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is defined by eq .  .",
    "together with eq .",
    "this gives    [ kwen ] @xmath79 here we introduce the energy density in the @xmath80-space , @xmath81which traditionally is called  energy spectrum \" according to eq .   in the leading in @xmath39 approximation the energy spectrum of kelvin waves",
    "is related to the wave action @xmath82 as follows : @xmath83    up to this point these considerations are agreed by one and all , and are the basis of further developments .",
    "recently kosik and svistunov  @xcite derived an energy spectrum of kelvin waves turbulence :    [ kwspectra ] @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the energy flux over scales and @xmath86 is yet unknown dimensionless constant . later lvov and nazarenko derived a very different result for the same spectrum : @xmath87    here @xmath88 is another dimensionless constant .",
    "both spectra are supposed to be  universal \" , ( i.e. independent of details of the energy forcing ) in the the scaling range @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the forcing wave number .    the disagreement between the spectra ( [ kwspectra ] ) resulted in a heated debate concerning the correct nature of the energy spectrum .",
    "to identify the origin of this controversy we should clearly state that both results  ( [ kwspectra ] ) were obtained within the same formal setup described in the previous subsection under the same set of assumptions about small nonlinearity and random phases .",
    "therefore the difference between the spectra must originate from one or more mistakes made by either or both derivations .",
    "indeed , we will argue that the mistake leading to the wrong result is in the the asymptotic behavior of the effective amplitude @xmath91 in the region where one of the wave vectors in the interacting sextet is much smaller than at least one other wave vector from the same sextet .",
    "the form of this asymptotics crucially affects the nature of the energy transfer in the kelvin wave cascade .",
    "the derivation of the interaction vertex @xmath91 for kelvin wave turbulence is not an easy task . in ref .",
    "@xcite the explicit form of @xmath91 was not presented . instead , the authors  simulated the collision integral by a monte carlo method \" with the conclusion that it converges and the main contribution to the energy evolution of kelvin wave with given @xmath80-wave vector originates from the energy exchange with other kelvin wave with @xmath92 .",
    "this statement of _ the locality of the energy transfer _ allowed the authors to use a dimensional estimate that leads to the the spectrum ( [ ks - spectrum ] ) .",
    "this result was criticized in @xcite where an explicit expression for the interaction amplitude @xmath91 ( in the asymptotic region ) was derived :    [ w6 ] @xmath93    based on this equation , it was shown analytically in ref .",
    "@xcite that the collision integral diverges .",
    "moreover , as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , two important sets of terms in @xmath94 of the order of unity were overlooked in ref .",
    "one was the consequence of a trivial algebraic mistake in the taylor expansion in eq .",
    "( [ w6 ] ) , where the authors forgot to expand the denominator .",
    "in addition , in ref .",
    "@xcite there was a conceptual mistake : in the kinetic equation ( see below ) the conservation of energy requires the exact frequency - resonance condition that accounts for the sub - leading contribution @xmath95 ,  ( [ omega ] ) , while cancellation of linear in @xmath39 terms in @xmath94 takes place only on the local induction approximation manifold .",
    "remaining contributions of the order of unity to @xmath94 where omitted in ref .",
    "it remains unclear , how ref .",
    "@xcite succeeded to state convergence of the collision integral ; this must be either due to a mistakes in the calculation of @xmath94 or due to an inaccurate implementation of the monte carlo numerical procedure .",
    "the divergence of the collision integral makes the assumption of locality for the ks spectrum invalid  @xcite .",
    "the non - locality of the spectrum   implies that it is un - realizable and physically irrelevant . recognizing the need for a greater understanding of the correct interaction term , a new _ non - local _ theory was promptly put forward , suggesting the alternative energy spectrum  ( [ ln - spectrum ] ) of kelvin waves .",
    "this result was immediately attacked in ref .",
    "@xcite , based on some nave symmetry arguments claiming that @xmath96    for small @xmath80 instead of the linear asymptotics  ( [ ln - w6 ] ) .",
    "note that in the case of quadratic asymptotics  ( [ ks - w6 ] ) the collision integral converges .",
    "then the kelvin wave energy cascade would be dominated by local interactions and spectrum  ( [ ks - spectrum ] ) would be valid . in the case of linear asymptotics  ( [ ln - w6 ] )",
    "the collision integral diverges  @xcite , the kelvin wave energy cascade is dominated by different - scale interactions and the spectrum  ( [ ln - spectrum ] ) takes place  @xcite .    to conclude , the controversy regarding the kelvin wave energy spectra  ( [ kwspectra ] ) is a direct consequence of the disagreement regarding the asymptotic behavior of @xmath94 for small @xmath80 .",
    "this is a fortunate situation , since it can be easily resolved by a careful calculation . to this aim , an explicit analytical expression  ( [ ln - w6 ] ) with its line - by - line derivation",
    "was made publicly available  @xcite .",
    "the symmetry arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite were analyzed in ref .",
    "@xcite where it was shown that the symmetry argument appeals to a local reference system in which @xmath12-axis follows the vortex line curved by long kelvin waves , while the hamiltonian and the interaction amplitude must be written in the global reference system with the @xmath12-axis oriented along the straight ( unperturbed ) vortex line . in the other words , the symmetry arguments are irrelevant to the problem under consideration  @xcite , and see also  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "we thus feel confident to proceed further in studying kelvin wave turbulence in the framework of the hamiltonian  ( [ heff ] ) with the interaction amplitude  ( [ ln - w6 ] ) . the controversy can be reopened only when someone will present a checkable derivation of an alternative expression for @xmath94 , which would be different from eq .  .",
    "the reader of this paper should not conclude that the problem of kelvin waves in superfluids is solved .",
    "rather , this is a complicated and intriguing phenomenon and a lot of actual problems in this field are still open or hardly studied .",
    "first , we stress that kelvin waves in real superfluid turbulence propagate along dynamically bent vortex lines in a vortex tangle .",
    "although in the limit of short kelvin waves the time dependence of the basic vortex configuration and their local curvature can be neglected , longer waves are also important in real experimental situations .",
    "secondly and more importantly , even short waves could travel long distances , whereas the classical wave turbulence theory assumes that the wave `` mean free path '' is much less that the system size ( the classical - quantum crossover in our case ) .",
    "how important such a finite - size is not yet understood .",
    "numerical simulation of the full biot - savart equation which could clarify these issues is still in its infancy  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", our analytical theory will assume that these limits of short and short - correlated kelvin waves are achieved .",
    "in addition we will assume that the amplitudes of kelvin waves are small .",
    "then the hamiltonian formulation of the problem  ( [ heff],[ln - w6 ] ) is justified .",
    "nevertheless it does not mean that spectrum  ( [ ln - spectrum ] ) is the only possible solution for kelvin wave turbulence .",
    "it known that approximations of weak wave turbulence leading from the _ dynamical _ hamiltonian equations to the _ kinetic _ equations in one dimensional media are very delicate .",
    "therefore in the second part of this paper we will present direct numerical simulations of kelvin wave turbulence in the hamiltonian formulation  ( [ heff],[ln - w6 ] ) .",
    "this simulation allows us to clarify another important issue : how long should the vortex line be in comparison to the kelvin wave - length to achieve the limit of unlimited ( in the physical space ) medium used in the theoretical analysis below .",
    "also , it allows to study the case when this limit is not achieved and the finite - size effects are important - this is the case of so - called mesoscopic wave turbulence .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was assumed that the kinetic equation in its continuous - media limit is applicable .",
    "the analysis of its collision integral  @xcite revealed that _ on the spectrum _ the leading contribution appears from those terms in which two wave - vectors are much smaller that the other four and a conjecture was made ( not a proof ! ) that the same kind of nonlocality should hold _ generally _ for most other kelvin wave spectra , in both steady and evolving turbulent states .",
    "this allowed for the development of an _ effective _ collision integral dominated by four wave mixing of the @xmath97 type resulting in a new four - wave kinetic equation .",
    "the remaining two small wave - vectors describe the chaotic bending of the vortex lines with a characteristic curvature radius of the order of the inter - vortex distance .",
    "we should note however that even in the framework of the effective four - wave kinetic equations  @xcite some questions have remained open .",
    "indeed , the spectrum ( [ ln - spectrum ] ) was proven to be a valid solution of this equation but its uniqueness in the class of scale invariant solutions and its stability have remained unclear and the pre - factor @xmath88 has not been found . in section [ s : anal ]",
    "we will demonstrate that the scale invariant energy spectrum ( [ ln - spectrum ] ) exists , it is unique with a regular pre - factor , @xmath98 . moreover , our numerics of the dynamical equation show that the ( [ ln - spectrum ] ) is indeed an attracting solution for the kelvin wave systems .",
    "not only we observe the correct value of the exponent for this spectrum , but also a relatively good agreement for the pre - factor .",
    "this is remarkable because this is probably the first example in wave turbulence where such agreement for the pre - factor value has been reported in numerical simulations .",
    "moreover , these numerical results demonstrate that the type of nonlocality conjectured for the kelvin waves ( two small wave vectors in a typical interacting sextet ) is robust and maintained in the attracting steady state .    in the next section",
    "we will prove that the non - local theory is correct and is the one that should be used in future theories of quantum turbulence .",
    "after this we will present numerical simulations that are based on the interaction term  ( [ ln - w6 ] ) and which not only confirm our analytical calculations but also validate the applicability of the kinetic equation .",
    "these numerics also allow to study the regimes which are hard to treat analytically when the kinetic equation description breaks down due to the finite - size effects - so - called mesoscopic wave turbulence .",

    "if this happens , we expect regimes of discrete or mesoscopic wave turbulence @xcite .",
    "mesoscopic wave turbulence occurs when the nonlinear resonance broadening @xmath139 becomes of the order of the grid spacing between frequencies @xmath144 , i.e. @xmath146 . in such a situation ,",
    "discreteness effects become apparent and the wave amplitudes become too weak to sustain a continuous cascade .",
    "instead , we observe sandpile behaviour @xcite , where energy accumulates at specific scales until it is reaches sufficient amplitudes to cascade . this process is then repeated at smaller and smaller scales , until energy eventually reaches the dissipation scale . when @xmath147 , then we are in a discrete wave turbulence regime , where only exact wave resonances occur .",

    "such an effect is most prominent in our weak - forcing simulation * c * where the observed constant @xmath88 is an order of magnitude smaller ; see table  [ tab : para ] . in this run , we observed ` sandpile ' or ` bursty ' behaviour characterized by sudden spikes in the energies shown in fig .",

    "we stress that the lne is only applicable for nonlocal kelvin wave turbulence .",

    "we discovered that the system suffers from intermittent energy bursts that produce fluctuations in the wave action spectrum at high wave numbers .",
