    "the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) was built to investigate strongly interacting matter at high temperature and energy density in the laboratory through high - energy heavy - ion collisions . at extremely high temperatures and baryon densities , a transition from the hadronic phase of matter to a new deconfined partonic phase , the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) ,",
    "is predicted by quantum chromodynamics ( qcd )  @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed that the color potential in quarkonia could be screened by quarks and gluons in the qgp  @xcite .",
    "quarkonia are bound states of charm - anticharm ( @xmath5 ) or bottom - antibottom ( @xmath6 ) quark pairs . as a consequence ,",
    "quarkonium production cross sections in heavy - ion collisions divided by the corresponding number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , @xmath7 , are expected to be suppressed compared to those in @xmath4 collisions if qgp is formed in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the @xmath0 is the most abundantly produced quarkonium state accessible to experiments . over the past twenty years",
    ", @xmath0 suppression in hot and dense media has been a topic of growing interest .",
    "various measurements of @xmath0 have been performed in different collision systems and at different energies , and indeed a suppression of @xmath0 production has been observed  @xcite .",
    "a similar centrality dependent suppression was found at sps ( s+u @xmath8 = 19.4 gev  @xcite , pb+pb @xmath8 = 17.2 gev  @xcite and in+in @xmath8 = 17.2 gev  @xcite ) and at rhic ( au+au @xmath8 = 200 gev  @xcite ) for midrapidity , even though the temperature and energy density reached in these studies are significantly different  @xcite . furthermore , a stronger suppression at forward rapidity ( @xmath9 ) compared to midrapidity ( @xmath10 ) was observed at rhic  @xcite .",
    "these observations indicate that effects other than color screening are important for @xmath0 production . among these effects , @xmath0 production from the recombination of @xmath5  @xcite",
    "was suggested to explain the suppressions at sps and rhic  @xcite . with the higher temperature and density at rhic",
    ", the increased contribution due to regeneration from the larger charm quark density could compensate for the enhanced suppression .",
    "this could also explain a stronger suppression at forward rapidity at rhic where the charm quark density is lower compared to midrapidity  @xcite . in addition to the color screening and regeneration effects , there are also modifications from cold nuclear matter ( cnm ) effects and other final state effects , such as nuclear parton distribution function modification  @xcite , initial energy loss  @xcite , cronin effect  @xcite , nuclear absorption  @xcite and dissociation by co - movers  @xcite . the suppression due to these effects has been systematically studied experimentally via @xmath11a collisions  @xcite . however , the extrapolation from @xmath11a to a+a is still model dependent .",
    "the nuclear modification factor of @xmath0 production in pb - pb collisions at @xmath12 tev has been measured at the lhc  @xcite . in comparison with results from rhic in au@xmath13au collisions at @xmath14 200 gev ,",
    "the @xmath0 production is significantly less suppressed , which suggests significantly more recombination contribution at lhc energies .",
    "the measurement of @xmath0 production at forward rapidity ( @xmath9 ) in au+au collisions by the phenix experiment at @xmath14 39 and 62.4 gev indicates a similar suppression level as that at @xmath15 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "measurements of @xmath0 invariant yields at different collision energies at rhic in different centralities at mid - rapidity can shed new light on the interplay of these mechanisms for @xmath0 production and properties of the medium .    in this letter",
    ", we further study the collision energy dependence of @xmath0 production and test the hypothesis of these two competing mechanisms of color screening and regeneration in the hot medium .",
    "we present measurements of the @xmath0 production at midrapidity ( @xmath16 ) with the star experiment in au+au collisions at @xmath8= 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev using data collected during 2010 and 2011 running at rhic and study the nuclear modification factors at these energies .",
    "the data sample used in this analysis ( rhic run 2011 ) is different from the previous published results  @xcite ( rhic run 2010 ) for au@xmath13au collisions at @xmath8= 200 gev .",
    "the star experiment is a large - acceptance multi - purpose detector which covers full azimuth with pseudorapidity of @xmath17  @xcite .",
    "the vertex position detector ( vpd ) was used to select au+au collisions that were within @xmath1815 cm of the center of the star detector  @xcite .",
    "the total numbers of 0 - 60@xmath19 central minimum - bias events that are used in this analysis are 182 million , 94 million , and 360 million for 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev , respectively .",
    "the @xmath0 is reconstructed through its decay into electron - positron pairs , @xmath20 ( branching ratio br(@xmath20)= 5.97@xmath18 0.03@xmath19  @xcite ) .",
    "the primary detectors used in this analysis are the time projection chamber ( tpc )  @xcite , the time - of - flight ( tof ) detector  @xcite , and the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter ( bemc )  @xcite .",
    "the tpc provides tracking and particle identification via the ionization energy loss ( @xmath21 ) of charge particles . the tof  @xcite measures the velocity of particles , which greatly improved electron identification at low @xmath1 .",
    "this detector , combined with the tpc  @xcite , clearly identifies electrons by rejecting hadrons in the low and intermediate @xmath1 range ( @xmath22 gev/@xmath23 ) .",

    "the calculations include two components : direct suppression and regeneration .",
    "the direct suppression represents the  anomalous  suppression of primordial @xmath0s due to cnm and color screening effects . according to the model calculations",
    ", the @xmath33 is about 0.6 for central collisions with only cnm effects .",
    "the regeneration component is responsible for the contribution from the recombination of correlated or uncorrelated @xmath5 pairs .",
    "the feed - down to @xmath0 from @xmath63 and @xmath65 has been taken into account in the calculations .",
    "no significant energy dependence of @xmath33 for 0 - 20 @xmath19 centrality is observed at @xmath66 200 gev . as the collision energy increases the qgp temperature increases ,",
    "thus the @xmath0 color screening becomes more significant .",
    "however , in the theoretical calculation  @xcite , the regeneration contribution increases with collision energy due to the increase in the charm pair production , and nearly compensates the enhanced suppression arising from the higher temperature .",
    "the higher @xmath33 at alice may indicate that the surviving @xmath0s are mainly coming from the recombination contribution .",
    "the model calculation describes the energy dependence of @xmath0 production from sps to lhc .",
    "in summary , we report on recent star measurements of @xmath0 production at midrapidity in au+au collisions at @xmath8 = 39 , 62.4 and 200 gev . suppression of @xmath0 production , with respect to the production in @xmath4 scaled by the number of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions , is observed at these three energies .",
    "the observed suppression is consistent with the suppression of directly produced @xmath0 mesons .",
    "no significant energy dependence of the nuclear modification factor ( either @xmath33 or @xmath32 ) is found within uncertainties .",
    "model calculations , which include direct suppression and regeneration , reasonably describe the centrality and energy dependence of @xmath0 production in high - energy heavy ion collisions .",
