    "deep multi - wavelength lookback surveys carried out over the past five years have improved our understanding of galaxy evolution in the young universe tremendously . at least over the past 10 gyr of lookback time , a correlation between the rate of star formation and the amount of assembled stellar mass in star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) , dubbed the main sequence of star formation ( ms ) , has been observed ( noeske et al .",
    "2007 ; elbaz et al . 2007 ; daddi et al . 2007 ) .",
    "while the scatter around the ms is not observed to evolve strongly with redshift , the zeropoint does , in the sense that high - redshift sfgs form stars at a higher rate than similar mass galaxies today .    complementing the observational results on the locus of sfgs in sfr - mass space , direct measurements of the co molecular line emission from galaxies residing on the ms have revealed molecular gas mass fractions as high as 35 ( 45 ) % at @xmath6 ( tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ) . linking surface densities of gas and star formation , genzel et al .",
    "( 2010 ) recently argued that high - redshift sfgs follow the same star formation law as local sfgs , unlike their merging counterparts that have shorter depletion timescales and follow a kennicutt - schmidt relation with a higher zeropoint ( see also daddi et al .",
    "2010 ) .    from the observed zeropoint evolution of the ms , and tightness of the relation",
    ", a picture has emerged in which the bulk of sfgs are forming stars gradually over timescales that are long ( one to two orders of magnitude larger ) relative to their dynamical times ( genzel et al . 2010 ; wuyts et al . 2011 ) .",
    "this is only possible by a continuous replenishment of their gas reservoirs .",
    "cold , filamentary streams of gas have been proposed on the basis of cosmological simulations as an efficient mechanism to penetrate the galaxies surrounding halos , and deposit new ( or recycled ) fuel for star formation ( keres et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; dekel et al .",
    "evidence from kinematics strongly supports such a continuous ( i.e. , non - major merger ) triggering and maintenance of star formation for the bulk of sfgs ( genzel et al . 2008 ; frster schreiber et al .",
    "2009 ; shapiro et al . 2008 ; frster schreiber et al . 2011a ) .",
    "in such a scenario , a secular mode of star formation dominates the cosmic sfr history , and the scatter around the ms can , aside from a contribution by measurement uncertainties , be attributed to burstiness induced by occasional ( minor ) merger events . while the excess star formation due to mergers may only amount to 5 - 10% ( hopkins et al .",
    "2010 ; rodighiero et al .",
    "2011 ) , they may play a crucial role in shaping the diversity of galaxies observed both at low and high redshift . the merger paradigm ( sanders et al .",
    "1988 ; hopkins et al . 2006 )",
    "links a wide variety of galaxy types in an evolutionary sequence in which the collision between sfgs creates tidal torques that channel gas to the center where it triggers a nuclear starburst ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1996 ) . when the starburst is accompanied by accretion onto the central supermassive black hole(s ) ( smbhs ) , this produces agn emission , and naturally accounts for the origin of a correlation between smbh and bulge mass ( di matteo et al .",
    "finally , a combination of gas exhaustion , supernova and agn feedback leads to a rapid decline in the sfr , leaving a post - starburst , red and dead galaxy as remnant ( wuyts et al . 2010 ; snyder et al .",
    "2011 ) .",
    "indeed , such classes of galaxies offset from the ms have also been identified observationally out to @xmath5 and even beyond : towards the high - sfr end with for instance bright sub - millimeter galaxies ( smgs , smail et al .",
    "1997 ; barger et al . 1998",
    "; hughes et al . 1998 ; see blain et al .",
    "2002 for a review ) , and towards the low - sfr end ( daddi et al . 2005 ; kriek et al . 2006 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "observations of their structural properties , albeit often limited to small samples , could lend credence to their merger connection .",
    "several of the smgs imaged in co show two - component morphologies and/or highly disturbed velocity fields , implying a major merger nature ( tacconi et al .",
    "massive ( @xmath7 ) quiescent galaxies at high redshift are increasingly more compact relative to similar mass galaxies today ( @xmath8 ) ( e.g. , van der wel et al . 2008 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2008 , but see mancini et al .",
    "2010 for a contrasting view ) , in agreement with expectations from binary merger scenarios in which the gas content of the progenitors increases with redshift ( khochfar & silk 2006 ; hopkins et al .",
    "2009 ; wuyts et al .",
    "2010 ) . due to the highly dissipational formation process , wuyts et al .",
    "( 2010 ) predict a larger degree of rotation in the remnants than in lower redshift early - type galaxies .",
    "observational evidence for high - redshift compact quiescent disks ( mcgrath et al . 2008 ; van der wel et al . 2011 ) could possibly reflect this , or alternatively may signal other quenching mechanisms at play .    with the high - resolution optical ( acs ) and",
    "near - infrared ( wfc3 ) cameras onboard hst , detailed structural measurements can now be obtained for ever larger samples , bringing statistical significance also for the more extreme populations .",
    "in particular , the ongoing cosmic assembly near - infrared deep extragalactic legacy survey ( candels , grogin et al . 2011 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2011 ) is collecting deep rest - frame optical ( and rest - uv ) space - based imaging over unprecedented areas .",
    "at the same time , the pacs evolutionary probe ( pep , lutz et al .",
    "2011 ) opens a window on the far - infrared emission of large samples of sfgs , and allows the calibration of other sfr indicators for use in fields that lack such ( deep ) far - ir data ( wuyts et al .",
    "2011 ) .    in this paper",
    ", we exploit high - resolution imaging and a cross - calibrated ladder of sfr indicators to study the structure of galaxies and their mode of star formation , as function of their position in the sfr - mass diagram .",
    "we discuss how properties such as size , surface brightness profile shape , sfr surface density , and @xmath9 ratios vary along and across the ms , and how these trends evolve with redshift ( from @xmath10 till today ) . to this end , we assembled samples of unprecedented size , with 639924 galaxies at @xmath2 , 132328 galaxies at @xmath3 , and 35649 galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "the data quality and sample size allow us to extend previous studies of the relation between structure and stellar populations in the nearby ( kauffmann et al .",

    "maraston et al .",
    "( 2010 ) showed that adopting exponentially increasing sfhs for star - forming galaxies at @xmath4 leads to negligible changes in the estimated stellar masses , unless also a stringent constraint on formation redshift is imposed , in which case the estimated stellar mass of these galaxies can increase by a few 0.1 dex .",

    ", the presence of such a correlation has been described in depth by , e.g. , kauffmann et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and brinchmann et al .",
    "scarlata et al . (",
    "2007 ) demonstrated that photometrically selected massive quiescent galaxies are already dynamically relaxed ( i.e. , have the morphological appearance of early - type galaxies ) at @xmath3 .",
    "also out to @xmath3 , maier et al . ( 2009 ) exploited the spectroscopic zcosmos survey to reveal a correlation between the specific sfr of galaxies and the sersic index of their surface brightness profiles . at larger lookback times ,",
    "our results are in agreement with previous findings , based on smaller samples , reporting a similarly early emergence of the hubble sequence on the basis of stellar surface mass density , galaxy size and visual appearance ( franx et al .",
    "2008 ; toft et al .",
    "2009 ; kriek et al .",
    "we find that , across cosmic time , the typical sersic index of galaxies is not optimally described as a function of their absolute sfr , or even their absolute specific sfr , but rather as a function of their position relative to the ms at the epoch of observation .",
    "the correspondence between mass , sfr and structure , as quantified by the sersic index , is equivalent to the hubble sequence .",
    "based on samples of unprecedented size , we see that such a sequence already existed at @xmath4 ; bulge - dominated morphologies go hand in hand with a more quiescent nature .",
    "first indications of such a correlation between sersic index and specific sfr out to high redshift were recently reported by szomoru et al .",
    "( 2011 ) based on 27 galaxies at @xmath3 and 16 galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "in detail , an additional interesting aspect is revealed by the @xmath57 distribution in sfr - mass space .",
    "the surface brightness profile shape does not vary monotonically across the main sequence , but instead shows a reversal in the high - sfr tail of the distribution , such that the upper envelope of the ms is composed of galaxies whose typical cuspiness is intermediate between those of normal ms galaxies and the quiescent population below the ms .",
    "this is illustrated further in figure  [ dev.fig ] , where we plot a cut through of the @xmath73 mass slice .",
    "the top panels show the histogram of deviations from the ms measured along the sfr axis : @xmath74 .",
    "the top left panel illustrates the well - known bimodality between star - forming and passive galaxies in the local universe ( e.g. , kauffmann et al . 2003 ) .",
    "a similar bimodality , albeit with a reduced amplitude of the quiescent peak , is visible at @xmath3 ( and becomes more pronounced if we were to limit ourselves to higher masses only ) .",
    "while both populations are also found in our highest redshift bin , the quiescent fraction is further reduced .",
    "incompleteness in our shallowest field , as well as uncertainties in photometric redshifts and estimated sfrs inhibit the identification of a true bimodality in the @xmath4 histogram .",
    "the bottom panels of figure  [ dev.fig ] show the median dependence of @xmath57 on @xmath74 ( _ black curve _ ) , as well as errors on the determination of the median ( _ black error bars _ ) .",
    "with grey polygons , we mark the central 68th percentile .",
    "clearly , a variety of profile shapes is measured , even at a given @xmath75 , and particularly in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 bins .",
    "this stems partly from measurement uncertainties , that dominate in the low surface brightness regime , but in addition likely means that in detail galaxies are more complex than a simple two - parameter ( @xmath62 $ ] ) family .",
    "interestingly , the scatter seems to be minimized for galaxies that reside on the ms .",
    "frster schreiber et al . ( 2011 ) present a detailed analysis of large and clumpy ms galaxies at @xmath4 , that exhibit shallow surface brightness profiles ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "such a population is also present in our sample ( see figure  [ dev.fig ] and the above quoted @xmath76 ) .",
    "focussing on the overall trend , we find the results at @xmath3 and @xmath4 to be very similar to those established at @xmath2 .",
    "namely , galaxies on the ms resemble exponential disks , high - sfr outliers have a centrally enhanced surface brightness profile , and once galaxies end up below the ms , they quickly reach a plateau of @xmath72 .",
    "we discuss the physical implications of this empirical relation in section  [ quenching.sec ] .",
    "we verified that , when excluding x - ray sources from our analysis , the same median dependence of the surface brightness profile shape on the location of galaxies in the sfr - mass diagram remains present .",
    "this is the case even for the fields with the deepest x - ray data .",
    "the same robustness also applies to the other galaxy properties discussed later in this paper .",
    "our test indicates that the observed trends ( particularly the enhanced sersic indices of the high - sfr outliers at a given mass ) is not merely due to a nuclear , non - stellar point source .",
    "when focussing on the x - ray detected sources alone , we find that they occupy the mass regime above @xmath77 , and span a wide range in sfrs , from the quiescent class to on and above the ms . within a given bin ,",
    "their surface brightness profiles differ in the sense that they have higher sersic indices and smaller sizes than normal galaxies of the same @xmath62 $ ] .",
    "point source contamination would drive the structural parameters in the observed direction , but extensive simulations ( see , e.g. , simmons & urry 2008 ) are required to constrain whether in addition there is any evidence for a different stellar structure of the hosts .    before moving to the next structural property , we have a closer look at the @xmath2 bin in figure  [ dev.fig ] , where we use structural measurements in five passbands to investigate how the observed trend depends on wavelength .",
    "the dotted colored curves in the bottom left panel of figure  [ dev.fig ] illustrate the median relation derived from sersic fits in the sdss @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 bands .",
    "together with the default @xmath17-band profile fits ( _ solid black curve _ ) , a trend emerges in which the overall relation between @xmath57 and @xmath75 is remarkably robust against morphological k - corrections .",
    "the largest difference is observed for galaxies that lie on the ms ( @xmath82 ) , such that a cuspier profile is inferred from redder waveband imaging .",
    "this comes as no surprise , as it is well known that many normal sfgs in the nearby universe are composed of a ( red , @xmath72 ) bulge and ( blue , @xmath69 ) disk component ( sargent et al .",
    "2007 ) . ] . at low and high values of @xmath75 , the sersic index levels of at similar values ( @xmath83 and @xmath84 respectively ) , irrespective of wavelength .",
    "this suggests that the light concentration in the centers of these galaxies corresponds to a mass concentration , and is not due ( only ) to the large luminosity of a young stellar population .",
    "having established the existence of a hubble sequence out to @xmath5 , we now turn to the zeroth order structural measurement of size , and address how it varies along and across the ms at each of our observed epochs .",
    "figure  [ re.fig ] is similar in nature to figure  [ n.fig ] , but the color - coding is now used to mark differences in the spatial extent of the surface brightness distribution ( @xmath85 ) . as in figure",
    "[ n.fig ] , a qualitatively similar behavior is observed at all redshifts .",
    "overall , more massive galaxies tend to be larger .",
    "however , the mass - size relation is not fundamental in the sense that at a given mass substantial variations in size occur that are not random , but instead correlate with the offset from the ms ( see also the appendix , figure  [ dev_app.fig ] ) .",
    "this translates to different mass - size relations followed by passive and star - forming galaxies , as reported previously by shen et al .",
    "( 2003 ) based on sdss , but also by williams et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and szomoru et al .",

    "( 2008 ) and toft et al . (",
    "2009 ) , high - redshift quiescent galaxies are more compact than the bulk of sfgs at the same epoch . also at @xmath2 , galaxies below the ms ( at least at @xmath88 ) tend to be smaller than those on the ms .",
    "the high - sfr tail of the @xmath2 distribution differs from normal ms galaxies in the sense that they tend to have higher surface mass densities ( i.e. , are more compact for a given mass ) .",
    "as we march up in redshift , our measurements are consistent with a similar behavior across all lookback times considered .    comparing the panels for the three redshift bins , it is immediately apparent that galaxies grow over time .",
    "we quantified the growth by fitting a @xmath89 relation to the galaxies in each @xmath62 $ ] bin .",
    "it is important to note that this reflects the size evolution of the galaxy population as a whole , and not per se that of any given galaxy individually , as galaxies will move from one @xmath62 $ ] bin to another as they build up stellar mass , and new systems will be added over time .",
    "we find @xmath15 to be varying across the sfr - mass diagram , from @xmath90 below @xmath91 to @xmath92 above @xmath93 . here , the range indicates the normalized median deviation over the different @xmath62 $ ] bins .",
    "splitting the latter class into galaxies above and below the ms at @xmath2 ( _ white line in the left - hand panel of figure  [ re.fig]_ ) , we obtain @xmath94 and @xmath95 respectively . in other words ,",
    "the rate of size evolution correlates with the specific star formation rate , reaching the lowest values in the ( especially massive ) quiescent population .",
    "having established the variation of galaxy structure along and across the ms , we now do the same for two parameters that characterize the mode of star formation : its surface density ( section  [ surfdens.sec ] ) , and its breakdown into unobscured and dust - enshrouded star formation ( section  [ obscuration.sec ] ) .",
    "a discussion of the physical implications of the observed relationships follows in section  [ model_iruv.sec ] .",
    "figure  [ surf.fig ] presents the dependence of the sfr surface density    @xmath96    on the position of galaxies in the sfr - mass diagram . by construction",
    ", this figure has the same information content as figure  [ re.fig ] , but its interpretation in terms of mode of star formation is more straightforward .",
    "galaxies that form stars more actively are not just upscaled versions of lower sfr systems .",
    "their ism conditions differ in the sense that also normalized by area they form more stars per unit time .",
    "lines of constant @xmath0 run diagonally , implying a tighter correlation with specific sfr than with sfr or stellar mass separately .",
    "schiminovich et al .",
    "( 2007 ) discussed this trend extensively for galaxies in the nearby universe . at higher redshifts ,",
    "this is consistent with recent findings based on rest - frame uv size measurements by elbaz et al .",
    "we confirm that the same trend is seen when rest - frame optical size measurements are used instead .",
    "we contrast @xmath0 to @xmath97 in figure  [ surfssfr.fig ] , where we plot the 25th and 75th percentile contours ( _ solid and dashed lines _ ) for each of the considered redshift bins . over 10 gyr of lookback time ,",
    "the bulk of galaxies follow a similar , linear relation between specific sfr and surface density of star formation .",
    "as we probe higher redshifts , the upper end of this relation becomes more densily populated .",
    "this trend can naturally be explained by increased gas mass fractions in the young universe ( e.g. , tacconi et al .",
    "2010 ) .    in equation  [ sfrsurfdens.eq ]",
    ", we adopted the same size measurement as discussed in section  [ structural_params.sec ] and  [ size.sec ] to represent the radius within which half the star formation takes place .",
    "i.e. , we adopted the best - fit @xmath85 of a single sersic profile fit . at @xmath2",
    ", we used the @xmath17 band by default .",
    "for the higher redshift samples , we used the longest wavelength high - resolution image available ( @xmath26 in the case of uds and goods - s , @xmath36 and @xmath22 for goods - n and cosmos respectively ) . in principle , radial variations in sfh and/or dust attenuation could bias the measurement of a half - sfr radius .",
    "e.g. , in the case of a superposition of a star - forming disk and a red and dead bulge , the total half - light radius would contain less than half the star formation ( particularly when measured in the red ) .",
    "in contrast , in the case of a galaxy where old and young stars trace the same distribution , but the dust column is centrally enhanced , the observed @xmath85 would contain more than half of the star formation ( particularly when measured in the blue ) .",
    "we take two simple approaches to investigate the impact of these potential biases on our results .",
    "first , we repeated our analysis at @xmath2 adopting each of the @xmath98 sdss bands to determine @xmath85 and based thereupon @xmath0 .",
    "we find that this induces a minor change only , in the sense that , for galaxies below the main sequence , @xmath0 increases by a few 0.1 dex from the bluest to the reddest band ( see the left - hand panel of figure  [ dev_app.fig ] in the appendix ) .",
    "overall , the pattern of @xmath0 in sfr - mass space does not depend appreciably on the adopted photometric band at @xmath2 .",
    "second , we stress that at @xmath3 as well as at @xmath4 , the dependence of @xmath0 on location in the sfr - mass diagram remains the same ( although with somewhat enhanced noise due to the smaller number statistics ) when considering the fields with rest - frame optical and rest - frame uv imaging separately ( see appendix b.1 ) .",
    "finally , we consider the ratio of re - emitted to unobscured star formation . what we denote as @xmath1 is for ir - detected galaxies computed as the ratio of the ir and uv contribution to the total @xmath54 ( see equation  [ sfruvir.eq ] ) :",
    "@xmath99 . for those galaxies in the deep lookback surveys that lack an ir detection , and for which we adopted the best - fit sfr from stellar population modeling",
    ", we derive @xmath1 as @xmath100 .",
    "here , @xmath101 is the extinction at 2800  as inferred from the sed modeling .",
    "this approach has the advantage of always producing positive values , unlike adopting @xmath102 as definition , which can reach negative values when @xmath103 .",
    "the latter situation can occur for quiescent galaxies with low ratios of present to past - averaged sfr , in which case the rest - frame 2800  emission contains a substantial contribution from older stars .    for the @xmath2 sample , total sfrs ( based on dust- and aperture - corrected @xmath104 measurements , see section  [ sdss_galex.sec ] ) are available from the mpa - jhu release , and we computed @xmath16 as for the higher redshift galaxies , where we interpolated @xmath105 from the galex nuv and sdss @xmath78-band photometry .",
    "the derived @xmath106 at @xmath2 are well defined for the star - forming population , but ill - constrained for the passive population for the above reasons .",
    "we therefore choose to exclude the passive @xmath2 galaxies from our analysis .",
    "the resulting sfr - mass diagrams , color - coded by @xmath1 , are presented in figure  [ iruvobs.fig ] .",
    "again , the qualitative appearance of the diagrams looks similar over the wide range of redshifts considered . at a given mass , a proportionally larger fraction of the star formation activity",
    "is revealed by reprocessed ir emission as we consider more actively star - forming systems . a positive correlation between bolometric luminosity and obscuration",
    "was presented previously for galaxies in the nearby universe ( heckman et al .",
    "1998 ) and at @xmath4 ( reddy et al . 2010 ) , but these authors did not trace the trend with sfr while specifically controlling for stellar mass . likewise ,",
    "an increase in @xmath1 is observed as we move along the ms from the low- to high - mass end .",
    "such a trend was not seen as clearly in @xmath0 ( figure  [ surf.fig ] ) , a finding that we will interpret as due to metallicity variations across the diagram in section  [ model_iruv.sec ] .",
    "finally , objects forming the upper rim of the galaxy distribution , also at lower masses , show enhanced ir emission .",
    "the latter trend is most prominent in the @xmath3 bin , but a hint of the same feature is seen at both lower and higher redshift as well .",
    "the observation that a precursor of the hubble sequence , with disk - like sfgs and cuspier quiescent systems , was already in place 10 gyr ago ( see section  [ profile.sec ] ) has important implications . to name one , a mechanism for galaxies to transition from the star - forming to quiescent phase must be universally present across cosmic time , at least out to @xmath5 .",
    "it is during this epoch around @xmath4 that the cosmic sfr density is observed to reach its peak ( e.g. , hopkins & beacom 2006 ) , and that large accretion rates onto galaxy halos are expected from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations ( keres et al . 2005 , 2009 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; dekel et al .",
    "we can therefore exclude gas exhaustion as sole driver of the transition from the active to passive phase . instead",
    ", a quenching mechanism must be at play .",
    "moreover , the observed relation between structure and stellar populations implies a causal connection between the quenching and the morphological transition .    as early as by toomre & toomre ( 1972 ) ,",
    "mergers have been invoked as a potential mechanism to transition from late to early hubble types .",
    "in such a scenario , much of the gas content of the progenitors is consumed by star formation in the nucleus , building up a central cusp .",
    "violent relaxation distributes the stars that were already formed prior to final coalescence in a near - de vaucouleurs ( @xmath65 ) distribution .",
    "feedback from short - lived massive stars that explode as supernovae , as well as energy that is released from accreting material onto the smbh(s ) and that couples to the surrounding ism drives out the remaining gas and heats up the galaxy halo preventing new infall ( e.g. , hopkins et al .",
    "2006 , and references therein ) .    in this light , the reversal of the decreasing trend of @xmath57 with @xmath74 ( see figure  [ dev.fig ] ) may signal that we are observing the galaxies at the high - sfr tail of the distribution during the peak of their sfh , in the process of building up a central concentration of stellar mass , much like that typically observed in the quiescent population .",
    "this would also explain their increased sfr surface densities and small sizes relative to normal sfgs on the ms .",
    "while galaxies above and below the ms by definition form the opposite extremes in terms of sfr , they may thus share a more similar nature in terms of structural shape . according to the merger evolutionary sequence",
    ", this would place them as nuclear starbursts in between ms galaxies and quiescent remnants .",
    "a crude duty cycle argument reveals that , if all quiescent galaxies at @xmath13 with @xmath107 and @xmath108 underwent a starburst of @xmath109 prior to quenching , the timescale of that burst must have been of order 110 myr to account for the observed numbers of such bursts :    @xmath110    here , @xmath111 represents the number density of objects with @xmath112 , and @xmath113 equals the number of newly quenched ( @xmath108 ) systems since @xmath114 ( which is most of them , given the relatively low number density at @xmath115 ) .",
    "the time interval probed in the @xmath3 bin spans @xmath116 gyr . for the @xmath4 bin , similar arguments lead to a value of @xmath117 myr . to determine these timescales , we restricted ourselves to the deepest fields , goods - south and uds , to avoid any incompleteness effects .",
    "our wfc3 @xmath26-selected samples in these fields do not suffer from incompleteness above @xmath118 , even for maximally old , high @xmath119 systems in our highest redshift bin ( see appendix b.1 ) . increasing the number statistics by pushing down to @xmath120 , where we are still highly complete",
    ", we obtain timescales of 170 myr and 120 myr at @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively .",
    "the derived timescales should be considered as crude upper limits .",
    "first , uncertainties in sfr estimates may lead to a contamination in the high - sfr tail by galaxies with intrinsically lower sfr .",
    "second , in the case that not all excursions to high sfrs are followed by quenching , the inferred timescale of bursts associated with a quenching event will be shortened further .",
    "overall , the timescales obtained are not inconsistent with those expected from merger - induced star formation on the basis of hydrodynamical simulations ( mihos & hernquist 1996 ; cox et al .",
    "2008 ) , although there may be room for other evolutionary paths to reach the quiescent phase as well .",
    "our observations of the structural ms and the quiescent population located below in figure  [ n.fig ] reveal two aspects that any galaxy formation and quenching model should account for .",
    "first , we find spheroid - like ( @xmath121 ) quiescent galaxies to be present over a wide range of stellar masses ( 1.5 - 2 dex ) at all redshifts , down to at least @xmath118 .",
    "second , galaxies with a large spread in star formation activities co - exist at the same stellar mass over a mass range of an order of magnitude ( roughly @xmath122 ) .",
    "if all galaxies at a given stellar mass are central galaxies and reside in an equally massive dark matter halo , this would imply that quenching is not a simple step function of halo mass . carrying out a detailed abundance matching analysis between galaxies at @xmath123 and their halo hosts , conroy & wechsler ( 2009 )",
    "also do not find evidence for a sharp characteristic halo mass at which star formation truncates .",
    "if on the other hand halo quenching is responsible for the transition from active to passive systems , this would imply that quiescent galaxies live in higher mass halos ( i.e. , have a smaller baryon fraction ) than sfgs of similar stellar mass .",
    "finally , a third quenching mechanism that can contribute to the build - up of the quiescent population is environmental ( satellite ) quenching . studying the role of environment and its impact on the morphological properties of ( part of ) the quenched population , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we do however note that y. j. peng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) argue this physical process only becomes relevant at late times ( @xmath124 ) and low masses ( @xmath125 ) .",
    "based on an empirical model that successfully reproduces the stellar mass function of star - forming and passive galaxies in sdss , y. j. peng et al .",
    "( 2010 ) attribute the quenching at larger lookback times to a combination of a mass - dependent component ( dominating at the high - mass end ) , and a mass - independent merger quenching component .",
    "together , these processes are claimed to be responsible for the double schechter mass function of passive galaxies .",
    "it is important to point out that their mass quenching is probabilistic in nature , rather than a step function , with a rate proportional to the sfr , and an underlying physical origin that may well be associated with agn or star formation feedback rather than a halo - scale phenomenon .      in sections  [ surfdens.sec ] and  [ obscuration.sec ] , we presented observational results on how the surface density and obscuration of star formation depends on the position of galaxies in the sfr - mass diagram . here",
    ", we investigate whether those two observations can be understood in the context of one self - consistent physical model that relates the amount of reprocessed emission to the column of obscuring material , and indirectly to @xmath0 .",
    "the aim of such a model is to explain qualitatively the difference in shape of iso-@xmath0 and iso-@xmath1 regions in the sfr - mass plane ( figure  [ surf.fig ] versus figure  [ iruvobs.fig ] ) , and to reproduce quantitatively the observed @xmath1 ratio starting from @xmath0 , with the help of a few fundamental , and where possible empirically calibrated , laws .",
    "our model involves three steps : a conversion from sfr surface density to gas surface density , a conversion from gas column to dust column , and a geometry - dependent translation from dust column to ir - over - uv ratio ( see top panel of figure  [ iruvcomp.fig ] ) . the first step boils down to an application of the kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) star formation law ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "recently , genzel et al . ( 2010 ) made the case for a ks law of the form    @xmath126 ) = & 1.17 \\log ( \\sigma_{mol\\ gas } [ m_{\\sun } pc^{-2 } ] ) \\nonumber \\\\    & - 3.48 \\label{ks.eq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    on which both nearby and high - redshift main sequence sfgs lie .",
    "major mergers follow a relation of similar slope according to these authors , but may be offset in normalization , so that a higher level of star formation is obtained for a given reservoir of molecular gas . for simplicity ,",
    "we assume equation  [ ks.eq ] holds for all galaxies in our sample , at low and high redshift .",
    "we apply equation  [ ks.eq ] to our observed @xmath0 , account for a 36% mass correction for helium to obtain the @xmath127 surface mass density , and add a fiducial plateau of @xmath128 surface mass density @xmath129 ( krumholz , mckee & tumlinson 2009 ) to obtain the total hydrogen column . in most cases ,",
    "the contribution of hi to the total gas column is negligible .",
    "the second step of our model accounts for the fact that not all galaxies have the same metallicity .",
    "this is relevant , because the limited number of cases in which metallicities as well as dust - to - gas ratios have directly been observed ( milky way , small and large magellanic cloud ) , illustrate that it is not the dust - to - gas ratio , but rather the dust - to - metal ratio that remains relatively constant between galaxies .",
    "we adopt a gas - to - dust ratio equal to that of the milky way @xmath130 ( bohlin et al . 1978 ) , with a linear scaling accounting for gas - phase metallicities deviating from solar :    @xmath131    even in the era of multi - object near - infrared spectrographs , spectral metallicity tracers of high - redshift galaxies , such as @xmath132/h\\alpha$ ] are notoriously difficult to obtain for large samples of galaxies , let alone for the sample size considered here .",
    "we therefore adopt an empirically calibrated functional form to compute the metallicity on the basis of known stellar population properties . rather than assuming an evolution of the mass - metallicity relation with redshift @xmath133 ( e.g. , erb et al .",
    "2006 ; maiolino et al .",
    "2008 ; mannucci et al .",
    "2009 ; buschkamp et al . in prep ) , we parametrize the metallicity as a non - evolving function of position in the sfr - mass diagram : @xmath134 . using the sdss spectral database , mannucci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) established such a fundamental surface in sfr - mass - metallicity space .",
    "furthermore , these authors find that galaxies out to @xmath5 lie on the same surface as do nearby systems .",
    "the observed evolution of the mass - metallicity relation stems in this picture merely from the fact that galaxies with higher sfrs are more abundantly present at high redshift .",
    "that higher sfr systems at a given mass have lower metallicities is interpreted as evidence for recent gas infall that simultaneously fuels the formation of new stars , and dilutes the metal - content of the interstellar medium .    even in the local universe ,",
    "measurements of the gas - phase metallicity ( and therefore the normalization of the mass - metallicity relationship ) vary by factors of @xmath135 depending on the tracer and calibration used ( kewley et al .",
    "given this systematic uncertainty , we choose to renormalize the mannucci et al .",
    "( 2010 ) relation so that it reaches a plateau of solar metallicity ( @xmath136 , asplund et al .",
    "2004 ) at the high - mass end , so that for galaxies with milky way properties ( @xmath137 ) , the milky way dust - to - gas ratio applies :    @xmath138    where @xmath139 . for @xmath140 , the smooth polynomial form from mannucci et al .",
    "( 2010 , equation 4 ) is applied , downscaled by the same factor .",
    "the scaling of the column with @xmath134 accounts at least in part for the difference in shape of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 diagrams ( figure  [ surf.fig ] and  [ iruvobs.fig ] respectively ) . while along the ms little evolution in @xmath0 is observed , gas - phase metallicities are expected to increase as we march up the ms .",
    "this leads to an increase in the dust column , and consequently of the reprocessed fraction of the star formation towards the high - mass end of the ms , as observed in figure  [ iruvobs.fig ] .",
    "in other words , our observations do not probe metallicities directly , but are consistent with the presence of a mass - metallicity and/or mass - sfr - metallicity relation . )",
    "is in principle inconsistent with the gas - phase metallicity scalings applied in our model . as a sanity check",

    "this systematic offset increases further toward higher redshift , amounting to an order of magnitude at @xmath4 .",
    "we speculate briefly on the physical origin of this trend .",
    "a refined model should account for an increased amount of uv emission escaping unhindered from high - redshift galaxies .",
    "this situation is reminiscent of adelberger & steidel ( 2000 ) , who found that for galaxies of a given sfr , at high redshift a larger proportion of that star formation is emitted in the uv .",
    "daddi et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also discussed that @xmath4 galaxies are more `` transparent '' to uv radiation than local galaxies with similar levels of star - forming activity .",
    "the offsets found in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 panels of figure  [ iruvcomp.fig ] could signal shortcomings in any of the three steps of our simple model .",
    "since the first two steps ( star formation law , and metallicity scaling ) are empirically motivated , and the third ( geometry ) is not , it makes sense to address the latter first .",
    "given that star formation , dust production , and the physical processes ( such as winds ) that determine the distribution of the ism are intimately connected , the idealized model of a homogeneous mixture of dust and ( young ) stars will likely break down at some level .",
    "if high - redshift galaxies are more patchy than their local counterparts , this would naturally explain why a relatively larger fraction of the intrinsic emission can escape the galaxies unattenuated .",
    "in contrast to galaxies today , the uv and ir emission of high - redshift systems would in that case more often be associated with physically distinct regions within a galaxy .",
    "if such a patchy configuration would indeed be more representative for @xmath4 galaxies , we would expect this to be revealed in terms of rich internal color variations in multi - wavelength high - resolution imaging .",

    "a large fraction of @xmath4 galaxies for which gas surface densities have been measured do lie on a relation with slope 1.17 and zeropoint -2.44 , but that is because due to sensitivity limitations these samples have often been biased to high - sfr outliers .",
    "recent measurements for @xmath4 galaxies on the main sequence ( i.e. , representative for the bulk of the @xmath4 population ) are consistent with the local relation for normal sfgs ( genzel et al .",

    "the required change therefore seems to be in tension with the observational constraints at @xmath4 available to date .",
    "finally , a lower dust column for a given @xmath0 could also be obtained if our metallicities of high - redshift galaxies are overestimated .",
    "if this is the case , this would imply that gas - phase metallicity is determined by three parameters ( @xmath148 ) rather than a non - evolving dependence on sfr and stellar mass .",
    "we stress that current observations out to @xmath5 do not require such an evolution with redshift of the sfr - mass - metallicity plane , but the high - redshift samples presently show a large scatter ( mannucci et al .",

    "the fact that a structurally distinct quiescent population below the main sequence is already present since @xmath5 implies that the quenching mechanism responsible for the shutdown of star formation must be universally present already since that epoch , and must be causally connected to the morphological transition as well ( or vice versa , see martig et al .",

    "<S> we analyze the dependence of galaxy structure ( size and sersic index ) and mode of star formation ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) on the position of galaxies in the sfr versus mass diagram . </S>",
    "<S> our sample comprises roughly 640000 galaxies at @xmath2 , 130000 galaxies at @xmath3 , and 36000 galaxies at @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> structural measurements for all but the @xmath2 galaxies are based on hst imaging , and sfrs are derived using a herschel - calibrated ladder of sfr indicators . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a correlation between the structure and stellar population of galaxies ( i.e. , a hubble sequence ) is already in place since at least @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> at all epochs , typical star - forming galaxies on the main sequence are well approximated by exponential disks , while the profiles of quiescent galaxies are better described by de vaucouleurs profiles . in the upper envelope of the main sequence </S>",
    "<S> , the relation between the sfr and sersic index reverses , suggesting a rapid build - up of the central mass concentration in these starbursting outliers . </S>",
    "<S> we observe quiescent , moderately and highly star - forming systems to co - exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass . at each mass and redshift </S>",
    "<S> , galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of size growth correlates with specific sfr , and so does @xmath0 at each redshift . </S>",
    "<S> a simple model using an empirically determined sf law and metallicity scaling , in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and stars is able to relate the observed @xmath0 and @xmath1 , provided a more patchy dust geometry is assumed for high - redshift galaxies . </S>"
