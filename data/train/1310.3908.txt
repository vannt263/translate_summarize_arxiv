    "for long time , domain boundaries in ferroelectric and ferroelastic materials have been looked at as mere juxtapositions of materials in the bulk state , lacking any interesting physical meaning on their own . in the last decade",
    "their role has been reconsidered , leading to the realization that domain walls ( dw ) can display novel features which do not emerge in the bulk . as such",
    ", they can become active elements of potential new devices , leading to the``domain wall engineering '' concept@xcite .",
    "the emergence of new functionalities at domain walls ( dw ) can be loosely understood in the framework of landau theory of phase transitions .",
    "in fact , walls separate domains that are characterized by a primary order parameter ( op ) pointing in two or more directions ( polarities ) , implying that some component of the op must monotonically decrease when approaching the domain boundary and eventually vanish at the wall . as a consequence , competing secondary order parameters , suppressed in the bulk , may in principle emerge in proximity of the boundaries @xcite .",
    "a paradigmatic example of the competition between primary and secondary ops has been put forward by the ferroelastic perovskite catio@xmath0@xcite .",
    "this material crystallizes at ambient conditions in a nonpolar @xmath1 structure ( @xmath2 setting adopted in the following ) characterized by antiferrodistortive distortions ( afd ) , which can be described as oxygen - octahedra tiltings and rotations , accompanied by a spontaneous ferroelastic strain .",
    "the parent cubic structure exhibits a secondary ferroelectric ( fe ) instability , namely a polar off - centering of ti within the oxygen octahedral cages associated to the fe polarization@xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is the prediction of fe instabilities in magnetic @xmath3mno@xmath0 ( @xmath3 = ca , sr , ba)@xcite which questioned the usually invoked empirical `` exclusion rule '' for magnetic and fe perovskites@xcite , as experimentally confirmed in ( sr , ba)mno@xmath0@xcite and strained camno@xmath0 thin films@xcite .",
    "therefore , the possibility of fe twin walls in this class of magnetic compounds may represent a new and unexplored route to achieve nanoscale multiferroic features in single - phase materials .",
    "furthermore , a significant magnetoelectric coupling may be expected , since both magnetism and fe features would originate from the very same b - site ions .    in principle",
    ", the presence of twin ferroelastic domains in catio@xmath0 could imply a suppression of the primary afd op at the domain wall and a consequent activation of the secondary fe instability .",
    "this motivated recent numerical calculations based on an atomic - scale , though empirical , description of the wall , predicting ferrielectricity at catio@xmath0 twin boundaries , with maximum dipole moments appearing at the wall.@xcite very recently , a direct observation of such ferrielectric domain boundaries in catio@xmath0 was achieved by transmission electron microscopy @xcite , reporting , however , offcentric displacements one order of magnitude larger than those theoretically predicted .",
    "more importantly , the simple interpretation based on the coexistence / competition of primary and secondary ops may not really apply to catio@xmath0 , since the afd distortions never fully disappear in the experimentally observed twin walls , while the polar offcenterings have been found to be strongly locked to the twin angle and local pattern of afd distortions .",
    "these observations apparently suggest an improper origin for the emerging dw ferroelectricity , hindering the possibility of switching its polarization via an applied electric field . on the other hand",
    ", a sizeable dw electric polarization could serve in principle as an additional handle for , e.g. , controlling twin - walls dynamics .",
    "motivated by these premises , we performed an accurate analysis of dw in both catio@xmath0 ( cto ) and camno@xmath0 ( cmo ) in the framework of first - principles density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations .",
    "we find that polar offcenterings are caused by the peculiar interplay of cooperative afd rotations at the wall , rather than by the activation of a secondary fe instability .",
    "microscopically , the mechanism can be viewed as a local realization of the recently proposed hybrid improper ferroelectricity @xcite . in this framework",
    ", the afd pattern of tilting / rotations of @xmath4o@xmath5 octahedra is expected to cause antipolar offcenterings of @xmath6site cations@xcite ; as a consequence , twin boundaries in perovskite oxides could play the role of walls between domains with different antipolar distortions , implying in principle a non - negligible contribution of @xmath6site cations to the wall polarization . on the other hand , a significant contribution to polarization",
    "is predicted to originate as well from b - site ions , that offcenter significantly even in the presence of a magnetic ordering ( an unexpected effect for cmo at ambient conditions ) in response to the local pattern of afd distortions at the dw .",
    "we adopted the pbesol generalized - gradient approximation for the exchange - correlation functional revised for solids @xcite as implemented in the vasp code@xcite , using a 500 ev plane - wave cutoff and a 1@xmath74@xmath74 monkhorst - pack mesh .",
    "cell and ionic relaxations have been performed until forces acting on ions were smaller than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "furthermore , as cmo is a g - type antiferromagnetic ( afm - g ) insulator in its orthorhombic ground - state@xcite , we impose the afm - g spin - ordering away from the wall , while allowing for different types of parallel / antiparallel - spin bonds at the interface .",

    "we adopted two choices [ shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ] , namely a @xmath4-site centered , with a ti ( mn ) ion sitting in the center of the unit cell , and a @xmath3-site centered cell , where a ca ion is located at the center of the cell . in the first case ,",
    "each of the six neighboring oxygens is shared by two unit cells , whereas each ca ion is shared by eight unit cells , implying @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( weight factors for @xmath3-centered cells are analogously chosen as @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) . within this formulation ,",
    "the origin of the reference frame can be arbitrarily chosen , since only relative displacements are taken into account ; furthermore , the contribution to total @xmath50 due to each individual ion can be unambigously identified , corresponding to eq .",

    "in fact , it has been shown that the @xmath57 pattern adopts two kinds of antipolar displacements of a - site ions@xcite .",
    "the first type , @xmath52 , involves a - ion displacements along @xmath58_{pc}$ ] directions of the pseudocubic cell , modulated in anti - phase when going from a ( 001 ) cao plane to an adjacent one ; in terms of @xmath59 it can be expressed as : @xmath60 the second type , @xmath53 , occurs along the @xmath8_{pc}$ ] direction and has an anti - phase modulation along the three pseudocubic directions , reading : @xmath61 their profile across the dw is shown in fig.[fig2 ] , suggesting that the twin boundary represents in fact a wall between domains with different antipolar polarities ; specifically , the @xmath11 component of both the antipolar ops vanishes at the boundary and is opposite in different ferroelastic domains .",
    "a third antipolar distortion @xmath62 is also predicted to be induced by the local afd distortions at the dw@xcite , involving displacements along the @xmath63_{pc}$ ] direction which are modulated in antiphase as one moves from a ( 100 ) cao plane to the next one . as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , the major contribution to the ca displacements comes in fact from this mode . on the other hand ,",
    "once the inversion symmetry is locally broken by the afd dw , the fe instability of b - site ions is easily activated , _ but only along the directions dictated by the primary non - polar distortions ( rotations ) _ causing the symmetry breaking@xcite .",
    "thus , a significant displacement of b - site ions occur parallel to the @xmath12 axis , while the switching of the @xmath11 component of the ca motions across the wall causes the anti - phase ( odd ) modulation of @xmath64 .",
    "such offcentering distortions are tipically smaller than those of ca ions ; it is worth to notice , however , that both ti and mn show anomalous born effective charges ( @xmath65 and @xmath66 ) , thus contributing significantly to the dw electric polarization .",
    "eventually , the devised improper origin of dw polarization easily explains the observed locking of the ionic offcentering to the twin angle and local afd rotational pattern .",
    "following ref . , the most relevant coupling between distortional modes at the wall is found to occur trilinearly between @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in principle , the polar distortion could be reversed by reversing one of these two rotational momenta , a possibility hardly attained in a realistic case due to the cooperative character of rotational distortions that would require a reversal of the rotational pattern in the whole domain .",
    "nonetheless , this situation is realized in our supercell where the two symmetric dws are characterized by exactly the same @xmath68 ( and @xmath69 ) but opposite @xmath70 , and where the polarization profile is indeed found to be reversed .      as for cmo , an interesting additional degree of freedom",
    "is brought about by the localized magnetic moments on mn ions .",
    "if , on one hand , all previous considerations perfectly apply to the case of a single magnetic domain ( with ground - state afm - g configuration ) , on the other hand significant spin - phonon coupling effects may be expected at cmo dws.@xcite we considered then a selection of possible interface spin configurations , with parallel - spin bonds along @xmath71 or @xmath13 direction .",
    "as expected , all these spin configurations resulted in higher energies as compared to the afm - g single domain after ionic relaxation ; the fm@xmath72 configuration shown in fig.[fig4]a ) , that corresponds to a truly magnetic domain wall ( mw ) between two afm - g domains with opposite polarities , results in the second lowest dw energy , namely @xmath73{mj / m^2}$ ] , with an energy increase of @xmath74{mj / m^2}$ ] with respect to the afm - g dw .",
    "the structural - induced modifications of magnetic exchanges can then be inferred by mapping total energies  as obtained by enforcing the afm - g optimal lattice structure  onto a heisenberg model with normalized spins , @xmath75 .",
    "we assumed nearest - neighbor ( @xmath76 ) interactions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 and isotropic next - nearest - neighbor @xmath80 interaction @xmath81 across each interface in the supercell , plus a @xmath76 exchange @xmath82 between two mn ions belonging to first and second mno@xmath83 layers from the twin boundary .    .heisenberg exchange coupling constants ( in @xmath84 ) and corresponding structural informations , @xmath85 mn - o - mn bond angle @xmath86 and mn - o bond length @xmath87 .",

    "exchange couplings are strongly affected by both the mn - o - mn angle ( increasing as @xmath95 ) and the mn - o bond length @xmath87 , being @xmath96 and @xmath97@xcite . from this parametrization",
    ", an offcentering of mn ions is also expected to enhance the corresponding exchange interaction ; in fact , assuming that a distortion @xmath98 induces a hybridization change @xmath99 , one immediately finds that @xmath100 .",
    "on the other hand , different local spin configurations at the boundary strongly influence the structural deformations , hence the polarization profiles .",
    "indeed , in the presence of both a magnetic wall ( the so - called fm@xmath72 configuration)and a structural twin boundary , the offcentering of relaxed mn ions is strongly reduced along the @xmath12 direction , while it is almost doubled along the @xmath11 direction , in order to decrease the magnetic energy cost of having parallel spin bonds across the domain wall [ see fig .",
    "[ fig4](b ) ] .",
    "interestingly , this kind of spin - phonon coupling is expected to show up also in the presence of a mw in a structural ( ferroelastic ) monodomain ; in fact , we predict an antiferroelectric - like profile of mn off - centerings at the boundary enforcing the fm@xmath72 spin configuration on top of a bulk lattice structure , with no twin boundaries [ see fig . [ fig4](c ) ] .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding mw energy @xmath101{mj / m^2}$ ] is slightly larger than the additional energy cost of having the magnetic wall pinned at the twin wall .",
    "we additionally note that , unfortunately , almost all the considered spin configurations do not display a net interface magnetization , due to perfect compensation of magnetic moments along different directions .",
    "on the other hand , a truly ferromagnetic ( fm ) interface , that in principle could be moved and controlled by applying an external magnetic field , is realized in the fm spin configuration , with all fm bonds around the boundary , with an estimated rise of the energy of @xmath102 ev per layer .",
    "however , an alternative possibility to engineer a fm ferroelectric dw , that is left for future analysis , would be that of having a local canting of spins at the wall , giving rise to weak fm moments .",

    "in conclusion , we have performed an accurate analysis from first principles of ( multi)ferroic domain walls in prototypical orthorhombic perovskites catio@xmath0 and camno@xmath0 .",
    "we have shown that twin boundaries and domain walls , which naturally occur in ferroic materials , can indeed host features which do not appear in the corresponding bulk . specifically , we propose that the predicted and observed twin - wall polarization in cto has a hybrid improper origin arising from a cooperative interplay of rotational distortions acting on both the a - site and b - site cations . in this picture , the existence of a secondary fe instability is substantially reflected only in the anomalous born effective charges of b - site ions , which cause a significant contribution to wall @xmath103 even for small offcenterings .",
    "however , we argue that dw polar ionic displacements are primarily determined by two interfacing antipolar structures with different polarities , and as such they are strongly locked to the local pattern of afd distortions . in confirmation of this scenario , we found that similar dw features , i.e. a significant offcenter of cations la and fe along the supercell @xmath12 axis , develop in lafeo@xmath0 , which displays in the bulk the same afd distortions as cto and cmo but no fe instability involving fe - ions offcentering .",
    "furthermore , a very recent tem experiment unveiled the existence of polar distortions at antiphase boundaries of pbzro@xmath0 , an antiferroelectric orthorhombic perovskite with similar rotation / tilting distortions , which have been explained in terms of a general landau theory approach to ferroelectricity at antiferroelectric domain walls@xcite .",
    "finally , our results suggest that the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism as arising by the very same ions is indeed possible , putting forward cmo as a possible material where multiferroic nanoscopic features can appear at its twin walls , and eventually suggesting a new route to engineer multiferroicity in single - phase materials . even though the dw ferroic properties do not seem to be switchable , due to their improper origin , they can in principle provide additional handles to control and move domain walls beside conventional mechanical - based mechanisms .",

    "the factor 2 comes from the presence of two dws in the supercell .",
    "in other words , rotations around the pseudocubic @xmath11 axis appears to be in - phase just at the dw , whereas rotations around pseudocubic axes @xmath108 remain out - of - phase and in - phase , respectively ; the local pattern of rotations around the dw would correspond then to a @xmath109 glazer s configuration .      in order to further verify the b ions offcentering caused by the afd distortions",
