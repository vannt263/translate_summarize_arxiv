    "most theoretical studies of paramagnetic pair breaking in superconductors followed the attitude of the classical papers by clogston @xcite and chandrasekhar @xcite where only spin pair breaking was considered and the orbital component was assumed to be negligibly small .",
    "a notable exception is the dirty limit theory developed by maki @xcite , fulde @xcite and others . in many experiments , on the other hand , _ both _",
    "pair breaking components are present and the neglect of the orbital contribution is not really justified .",
    "recently , ultra - thin films became available and several new classes of layered superconducting compounds have been discovered . for applied field parallel to the films @xcite or conducting planes @xcite , pauli paramagnetism can be the dominating pair breaking effect , provided the conducting layers are sufficiently separated from each other or the thickness of the films is sufficiently small . in many of these compounds , including high-@xmath1 cuprates and organic superconductors , impurity scattering and spin - orbit coupling is small and orbital pair breaking is - for an applied field parallel to the planes - the most important second order effect , next to the spin effect , to be taken into account .    of particular interest",
    "is the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov(fflo ) state @xcite , which is a spatially inhomogeneous superconducting state , predicted to occur in clean superconductors with purely paramagnetic limiting .",
    "recent critical field measurements @xcite in the quasi - two - dimensional organic superconductor @xmath2 strongly suggest that a state of the fflo type exists in this material ; agreement between experiment @xcite and existing theories has been successfully checked @xcite both in view of the angle - dependence @xcite and the temperature dependence @xcite of the upper critical field ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "apparently , this is the first time since the original predictions in 1964 @xcite that quantitative agreement between theory and experiment with regard to the fflo phase boundary has been established .",
    "strong paramagnetic effects can also be expected for the high-@xmath3 cuprate superconductors at low temperatures , when the conducting planes in adjacent unit cells are well separated from each other .",
    "a measurement @xcite at @xmath4 in @xmath0 indicates rather clearly that the superconducting state is paramagnetically limited but , on the other hand , the observed transition is too broad to allow a decision between the fflo state and the homogeneous superconducting state .",
    "a measure of the relative strength of orbital and paramagnetic pair breaking is the ratio of the paramagnetic critical field @xmath5 divided by the orbital upper critical field @xmath6 of a type ii superconductor . for a bulk superconductor in the clean limit",
    "this ratio can be written as @xmath7 in terms of the fermi wavelength @xmath8 and the coherence length @xmath9 of bcs theory .",
    "this relation implies that orbital pair breaking will always be the dominating mechanism in bulk superconductors , no matter how large the ginzburg - landau ( gl ) parameter @xmath10 is ; this holds at least in the framework of conventional bcs theory . in a thin superconducting layer of thickness @xmath11 ,",
    "on the other hand , the orbital critical field @xmath12 is increased by a factor of @xmath13 and the corresponding ratio is given by @xmath14 in comparison to eq .",
    "( [ eq : relpauliupper ] ) a small transverse dimension @xmath15 of the film suppresses the orbital effect and enlarges the spin effect drastically .",
    "however , equation ( [ eq : relpaulifilm ] ) also shows , that the critical thickness which separates the spin pair - breaking and orbital pair - breaking dominated regimes is still of the order of an atomic distance .",
    "thus , the estimate ( [ eq : relpaulifilm ] ) , which is confirmed by more quantitative calculations to be presented below , indicates that a nearly perfect two - dimensional situation is required in order to justify the neglect of orbital pair breaking contribution in clean superconductors .",
    "( the situation in dirty superconductors is much more favorable for the spin effect ; the fflo state , however , is suppressed by impurities ) .",
    "the simultaneous action of both types of pair breaking has already been studied for a particular situation , an infinitely thin superconducting film in a tilted magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in such a configuration , orbital pair breaking is entirely due to the perpendicular field component , while the component parallel to the film is exclusively responsible for the spin effect .",
    "the states near the upper critical field can be characterized by different landau quantum numbers @xmath16 , depending on the tilt angle @xcite .",
    "the order parameter structure near @xmath6 has also been investigated and shows interesting properties , such as several zeros with different vorticity per unit cell @xcite .",
    "for exactly plane - parallel external field the fflo phase is recovered .",
    "however , in this limit no orbital pair breaking exists and only the spin effect survives , as a consequence of the vanishing thickness of the superconducting layer in this model .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a superconducting film of _ finite thickness _ in a magnetic field parallel to the conducting plane .",
    "thus , the usual model of purely paramagnetic pair breaking is generalized in a different way , taking into account the influence of a finite orbital pair breaking component on the fflo state .",
    "the model is formulated in section [ sec : baseq ] , using the framework of the quasiclassical eilenberger equations .",
    "we assume that the film thickness is smaller than the coherence length and use a cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "this shape of the fermi surface allows us to study the influence of orbital pair breaking without any additional complications , like scattering of quasiparticles at the film boundaries .",
    "such boundary effects seem less important in the present context , but may , nevertheless , be present in many materials and should be taken into account in future work .",
    "in addition , the cylindrical shape of the fermi surface , which corresponds to a truly two - dimensional situation , allows us to extend our investigations to superconducting layers of atomic dimension .",
    "the main results , obtained by solving numerically the relevant phase boundary and stability equations , and a discussion of possible orbital pair breaking contributions in the plane - parallel field configuration of @xmath0 , are reported in section [ sec : resdis ] .",
    "finally , the results are summarized in section [ sec : summarize ] .",
    "we first calculate the highest field where a superconducting solution of the quasiclassical equations , for small order parameter @xmath17 , exists in a thin film .",
    "this field may correspond to a second order phase transition or to the supercooling limit of the normal conducting state ; to make a decision between these two possibilities the free energy of the competing homogeneous superconducting state will be calculated in a second step .",

    "the paramagnetic pair - breaking effect dominates for very small @xmath61 while the orbital effect dominates for large @xmath61 .",

    "[ fig : btplan3fieds ] reveals , however , significant differences .",
    "the fflo transition field is much stronger suppressed than the line @xmath95 where the free energies of the homogeneous states coincide . as a consequence , for @xmath107 ( see top of fig .  [",
    "fig : btplan3fieds ] ) the fflo transition vanishes ( @xmath98 becomes the supercooling field of the normal state ) and is replaced by a first order transition at @xmath95 to the homogeneous superconducting state .",
    "note that a conducting layer of atomic thickness ( dimension of unit cell in the plane ) yields enough orbital pair breaking to produce this suppression of @xmath98 in favor of @xmath95 .",
    "this behavior is not unreasonable ; spatially varying states are known to be much more sensitive to perturbations than homogeneous states ( recall in this context andersons theorem ) . with further increasing orbital pair breaking ( see middle and bottom of fig .  [",
    "fig : btplan3fieds ] ) the lines @xmath98 and @xmath97 tend to merge and the metastable region shrinks ; for @xmath108 orbital pair - breaking dominates .",
    "the behavior of all four fields as a function of @xmath61 is shown in fig .",

    "if the thickness where @xmath98 and @xmath95 cross is denoted by @xmath110 , then the fflo state is only realized in the small range @xmath111 , for @xmath112 a first order transition to the homogeneous ( mainly ) paramagnetically limited state occurs . the fflo line plays the role of a supercooling limit of the normal state until it falls ( at @xmath113 ) below the line @xmath97 , where the normal - conducting state is limited by spatially constant superconducting fluctuations .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath114 of the fflo state decreases with increasing @xmath61 until it jumps to @xmath115 at the line @xmath97 ( at the crossing point two degenerate solutions exist for @xmath114 ) .",
    "it should be pointed out that we continue to use here the term fflo state , even if this term denotes , strictly speaking , a state without any orbital pair breaking contribution . with increasing @xmath61",
    "the lines @xmath116 approach each other and the transition becomes identical to the well - known second order transition of a thin film in a parallel field , which is entirely due to orbital pair breaking ( the region of really large @xmath61 where the difference between type i and type ii superconductivity becomes important is clearly outside the range of validity of the present model ) .",
    "the results reported so far have been restricted to s - wave superconductors , with isotropic gap [ using @xmath117 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lingapsenkparal]),([eq : scophomfind ] ) ] . a few calculations have also been performed for d - wave superconductors , using @xmath118 .",
    "the results generally confirm the behavior found for s - wave superconductors .",
    "an interesting peculiarity of d - wave superconductors without any orbital pair - breaking is a steep rise of @xmath98 with decreasing @xmath103 below @xmath119 ( see fig .  4 of manalo and klein @xcite ) .",
    "this peak belongs to the @xmath120 portion of the critical field @xcite and is much steeper than the corresponding part of the critical field curve for s - wave superconductors .",
    "our calculations show that this peak can be effectively suppressed by a very small ( @xmath121 ) amount of orbital pair breaking .",
    "the absence of this peak in measurements @xcite on @xmath2 may be an indication of a very small residual orbital pair - breaking contribution in this material ; a more detailed study would be worth while .",
    "let us investigate the consequences of the fact that the fflo state can be suppressed in favor of the homogeneous superconducting state by a very small admixture of orbital pair - breaking ( see figure [ fig : bdplan4fields ] ) .",
    "we have not mapped out a complete phase diagram like figure [ fig : bdplan4fields ] for d - wave superconductors ( where @xmath98 becomes anisotropic as a consequence of the finite @xmath61 ) but instead performed a few calculations in order to get an overview of what happens .",
    "the results confirm qualitatively the main feature visible in figure [ fig : bdplan4fields ] , namely a much stronger suppression of @xmath98 , as compared to @xmath95 , by orbital pair - breaking .",
    "for @xmath0 we have two conducting @xmath122 layers per unit cell with a distance of @xmath123 , while the c - axis zero - temperature coherence length is estimated @xcite to be @xmath124 . the coupling between bilayers in adjacent unit cells",
    "may obviously be neglected , as a consequence of the large length @xmath125 of the unit cell in this direction .",
    "the coupling between the two layers in one unit cell , on the other hand , remains an open question , and the following two possibilities should be taken into consideration .",
    "the first possibility is , that the two superconducting layers decouple at low @xmath103 , below some crossover temperature @xmath126 .",
    "as is well known , the orbital critical field of weakly coupled layers diverges @xcite below some crossover temperature @xmath126 , which means that paramagnetic pair - breaking is the only remaining mechanism to limit the superconducting state .",
    "this requires a two - dimensional , in - plane mechanism of superconductivity .",
    "the amount of orbital pair - breaking would be negligibly small in this case and the superconducting state below the critical field should be the fflo state .",
    "the second possibility is that the superconducting state keeps its finite extension for arbitrary @xmath103 .",
    "this requires an inter - plane mechanism where the bilayer structure is essential for the superconducting pairing process . in this case , the bilayer may be approximately replaced by a single layer of finite thickness @xmath127 .",
    "taking a value of @xmath128 for the fermi velocity in the @xmath129 plane , as measured by andreev reflections @xcite , we estimate a value between @xmath62 and @xmath130 for our dimensionless thickness parameter @xmath131 , which measures the amount of orbital pair - breaking .",
    "thus in this case , if the bilayer structure can be approximated by a finite slab , the amount of intrinsic orbital pair - breaking in ybco , brought about by the finite thickness of this slab , will be by far large enough to suppress the fflo state .",
    "the second order fflo transiton will be replaced by a first order transition to a homogeneous superconducting state ; this transition is due to the combined action of _ both _ pair breaking mechanisms rather than a single one . for a typical value of @xmath132",
    ", the critical field would be still of the same order of magnitude as the purely paramagnetically limited , ( pauli limiting ) field at @xmath70 but with a strongly reduced metastability region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : bdplan4fields ] )    the transport measurement of dzurak et al .",
    "@xcite of the critical field of @xmath0 at @xmath133 led to a result of the order of the pauli limiting field @xmath134 ; the transition seems , however , too broad to distinguish between the fflo and pauli limiting fields .",
    "further , more accurate experiments are required to settle this question , which concerns fundamental aspects of the superconducting state in high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "observation of the fflo state in the plane - parallel field configuration of @xmath0 would be a strong argument in favor of an in - plane mechanism of superconductivity in this material .",
    "the relevance of this question has also been discussed by yang and sondhi @xcite , using the framework of the lawrence - doniach model , which is in a sense complementary to the present approach .",
    "the orbital pair - breaking effect due to the finite thickness of the conducting layers has previously been taken into account in a theory by schneider and schmidt @xcite .",
    "this theory may be used successfully to fit the experimental data @xcite near @xmath72 , but neglects all paramagnetic effects .",
    "the purely paramagnetic limit , on the other hand , has been studied by maki and won @xcite and by yang and sondhi @xcite .",
    "the present results show that _ both _ effects should be taken into account for a detailed description of the transition .",
    "the orbital effect can not be neglected even if the orbital critical field is several times higher than the paramagnetic limiting field .    finally , we note , that single atomic ( molecular ) layers are responsible for the superconducting state in the organic compound @xmath2 where phase boundaries compatible with a d - wave version of the fflo state have recently been observed .",
    "thus , a considerable influence of orbital pair - breaking , which would suppress the fflo state in favor of the homogeneous superconducting state , does not exist in this material .",
    "measurements of the detailed temperature - dependence of @xmath98 close to @xmath135 could reveal even small admixtures of an orbital pair - breaking component .",
    "we developed a theory of competing paramagnetic and orbital pair - breaking effects in clean superconducting films and layers .",
    "the destructive influence of orbital pair - breaking on the fflo state turned out to be stronger than commonly expected .",
    "it is necessary to have single - atomic layers in exactly plane - parallel fields in order to be able to neglect completely the orbital component and observe the `` pure '' fflo state .",
    "we calculated only the upper phase boundary of the `` mixed '' fflo state ( which occurs in films of finite thickness as a consequence of the combined action of both pair breaking mechanisms ) .",
    "the equilibrium structure as well as the lower transition line to the homogeneous superconducting state , have not yet been calculated for this new inhomogeneous state .",
    "another challenging open question is a microscopic treatment of josephson coupling between layers of finite thickness .",
    "our results show that a careful measurement of the plane - parallel critical field in @xmath0 could give important information on the question whether an in - plane or an inter - plane mechanism is responsible for superconductivity in @xmath136 superconductors .",

    "<S> paramagnetic pair breaking is believed to be of increasing importance in many layered superconducting materials such as cuprates and organic compounds . </S>",
    "<S> recently , strong evidence for a phase transition to the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov(fflo ) state has been obtained for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> we present a new theory of competing spin and orbital pair breaking in clean superconducting films or layers . as a general result </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the influence of orbital pair breaking on the paramagnetically limited phase boundary is rather strong , and its neglect seldom justified . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly true for the fflo state which can be destroyed by a very small orbital contribution . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the situation in @xmath0 which has two coupled conducting cu - o layers per unit cell . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> an intrinsic orbital pair breaking component might exist even for applied field exactly parallel to the layers . </S>"
