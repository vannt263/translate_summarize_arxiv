    "let @xmath0 be a set , and @xmath1 a symmetric function that satisfies , for any @xmath2 and any @xmath3 and @xmath4 : @xmath5 such a function is called a _ positive definite kernel _ on @xmath0 .",
    "a famous result by @xcite states the equivalence between the definition of a positive kernel and the embedding of @xmath0 in a hilbert space , in the sense that @xmath6 is a positive definite kernel on @xmath0 if and only if there exists a hilbert space @xmath7 with inner product @xmath8 and a mapping @xmath9 such that , for any @xmath10 , it holds that : @xmath11    the construction of positive definite kernels on various sets @xmath0 has recently received a lot of attention in statistics and machine learning , because they allow the use of a variety of algorithms for pattern recognition , regression of outlier detection for sets of points in @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "these algorithms , collectively referred to as _ kernel methods _ , can be thought of as multivariate linear methods that can be performed on the hilbert space implicitly defined by any positive definite kernel @xmath6 through ( [ eq : inp ] ) , because they only access data through inner products , hence through the kernel .",
    "this `` kernel trick '' allows , for example , to perform supervised classification or regression on strings or graphs with state - of - the - art statistical methods as soon as a positive definite kernel for strings or graphs is defined .",
    "unsurprisingly , this has triggered a lot of activity focused on the design of specific positive definite kernels for specific data , such as strings and graphs for applications in bioinformatics in natural language processing @xcite .",
    "motivated by applications in computational chemistry , @xcite proposed recently a kernel for labeled graphs , and more generally for structured data that can be decomposed into subparts .",
    "the kernel , called _ optimal assignment kernel _ , measures the similarity between two data points by performing an optimal matching between the subparts of both points .",
    "it translates a natural notion of similarity between graphs , and can be efficiently computed with the hungarian algorithm .",
    "however , we show below that it is in general not positive definite , which suggests that special care may be needed before using it with kernel methods .",
    "it should be pointed out that not being positive definite is not necessarily a big issue for the use of this kernel in practice .",
    "first , it may in fact be positive definite when restricted to a particular set of data used in a practical experiment .",
    "second , other non positive definite kernels , such as the sigmoid kernel , have been shown to be very useful and efficient in combination with kernel methods .",
    "third , practitioners of kernel methods have developed a variety of strategies to limit the possible dysfunction of kernel methods when non positive definite kernels are used , such as projecting the gram matrix of pairwise kernel values on the set of positive semidefinite matrices before processing it .",
    "the good results reported on several chemoinformatics benchmark in @xcite indeed confirm the usefulness of the method .",
    "hence our message in this note is certainly not to criticize the use of the optimal assignment kernel in the context of kernel methods .",
    "instead we wish to warn that in some cases , negative eigenvalues may appear in the gram matrix and specific care may be needed , and simultaneously to contribute to the limitation of error propagation in the scientific litterature .",
    "let us first define formally the optimal assignment kernel of @xcite .",
    "we assume given a set @xmath12 , endowed with a positive definite kernel @xmath13 that takes only nonnegative values .",
    "the objects we consider are tuples of elements in @xmath12 , i.e. , an object @xmath14 decomposes as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the length of the tuple @xmath14 , denoted @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "we note @xmath0 the set of all tuples of elements in @xmath12 .",
    "let @xmath19 be the symmetric group , i.e. , the set of permutations of @xmath16 elements .",
    "we now recall the kernel on @xmath0 proposed in @xcite :            the meaning of the statement `` not always '' in theorem [ thm1 ] is that there exist choices of @xmath12 and @xmath13 such that the optimal assignment kernel is positive definite , while there also exist choices for which it is not positive definite .",
    "theorem [ thm1 ] contradicts theorem 2.3 in @xcite , which claims that the optimal assignment kernel is always positive definite .",
    "the proof of theorem 2.3 in @xcite , however , contains the following error . using the notations of @xcite , the author define in the course of their proof the values @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "they show that @xmath25 , on the one hand , and that @xmath26 , on the other hand . from this",
    "they conclude that @xmath27 , which is obvioulsy not a valid logical conclusion .",
    "when @xmath29 , the tuples are simply repeats of the unique element , hence each element @xmath31 is uniquely defined by its length @xmath32 .",
    "the optimal assignment kernel is then given by : @xmath33 the function @xmath34 is known to be positive definite on @xmath35 , therefore @xmath6 is a valid kernel on @xmath0 .",
    "the function @xmath13 defined in lemma [ lem2 ] is the well - known gaussian radial basis function kernel , which is known to be positive definite and only takes nonnegative values , hence it satisfies all hypothesis needed in the definition of the optimal assignment kernel . in order to show that the latter is not positive definite",
    ", we exhibit a set of points in @xmath0 that can not be embedded in a hilbert space through ( [ eq : inp ] ) . for this",
    "let us start with four points that form a square in @xmath12 , e.g. , @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( figure [ fig : square ] ) .        in the space @xmath0 of tuples ,",
    "let us now consider the six @xmath44-tuples obtained by taking all pairs of distinct points : @xmath45 . using the definition of the optimal assignment kernel @xmath46 for @xmath47 , we easily obtain : @xmath48 if @xmath6 was positive definite , then these six @xmath44-tuples could be embedded to a hilbert space @xmath7 by a mapping @xmath9 satisfying ( [ eq : inp ] ) .",
    "let us show that this is impossible .",
    "let @xmath49 be the hilbert distance between two points @xmath21 after their embedding in @xmath7 .",
    "it can be computed from the kernel values by the classical equality : @xmath50 we first observe that @xmath51 , and @xmath52 .",
    "therefore , @xmath53 from which we conclude that @xmath54 form a half - square , with hypotenuse @xmath55 . a similar computation shows that @xmath56 is also a half - square with hypotenuse @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , @xmath57 which shows that the four points @xmath58 are in fact coplanar and form a square .",
    "the same computation when @xmath59 and @xmath60 are respectively replaced by @xmath61 and @xmath62 shows that the four points @xmath63 are also coplanar and also form a square .",
    "hence all six points can be embedded in @xmath64 dimensions , and the points @xmath65 are themselves coplanar and must form a rectangle on the plane equidistant from @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( figure [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the edges of this rectangle have all the same length @xmath68 and is therefore a square , whose hypotenuse @xmath55 should have a length @xmath69 .",
    "however a direct computation gives @xmath70 , which provides a contradiction since @xmath71 .",
    "hence the six points can not be embedded into a hilbert space with @xmath6 as inner product , which shows that @xmath6 is not positive definite on @xmath0 .",
