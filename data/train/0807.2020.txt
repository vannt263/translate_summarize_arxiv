    "the result , @xmath14 , plays a dominant role in fixing the central value of the current pdg assessment  @xcite , @xmath15 .    over the last year",
    ", a number of improved non - lattice determinations of @xmath0 have appeared , in a variety of independent processes , over a wide range of scales  @xcite .",
    "the results , given in table  [ table1 ] ( with all errors combined in quadrature ) , yield a weighted average , @xmath16 , @xmath5 higher than the lattice determination . this difference , though not large , motivates revisiting the lattice analysis , especially in light of the existence of new high - scale ( @xmath17 fm ) lattice data not available at the time of the earlier study .",

    "the difference of the 3-fold and 5-fold determinations is @xmath18 , significantly smaller than the @xmath19 overall scale uncertainty .",
    "the results thus show no evidence for any instability associated with opening up the fit to lower scales .",
    "while the total error on @xmath0 is the same for all three @xmath20 considered , the general arguments above lead us to believe that the most reliable determination is that obtained using the highest - scale observable , @xmath1 , and highest - scale ( 3-fold fit ) analysis window . our final assessment",
    ", @xmath21 is in excellent agreement with the non - lattice average and the result , @xmath22 , of the independent hpqcd analysis .",

    "thanks to the members of the milc collaboration for making their configurations available to the community , and to doug toussaint and carleton de tar for providing information on the @xmath17 and @xmath23 fm lattices not currently available in the literature .",
    "km would like to acknowledge very useful discussions with the members of the hpqcd collaboration , especially g.p .",
    "lepage , clarifying details of the original lattice analysis , the recent hpqcd update , and providing information on ongoing work .",
    "after the completion of the work reported in this paper , the hpqcd collaboration posted an update of their earlier 2005 analysis  @xcite .",
    "this update works with a subset of 11 of the available milc ensembles , spanning the @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath11 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 fm lattices and a range of @xmath28 .",
    "the fits follow the strategy of the earlier analysis  @xcite , employing the expansion parameter @xmath29 , and fitting the unknown @xmath30 using priors .",
    "linear mass extrapolation has been employed , and mass - independent np @xmath31 contributions estimated and subtracted using the lo formula for @xmath32 .",
    "the fitting of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , observable by observable , using central input and prior widths , is also as in the earlier analysis , with the exception that the central value and width for @xmath35 are now @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "the hpqcd implementation differs from ours in the choice of expansion parameter , and in the implementation of the input information on @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath38 . for the reasons discussed above",
    ", we expect the impact on @xmath0 of the observable - by - observable fitting of @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath39 in the hpqcd approach to be small for @xmath20 having small gluon condensate corrections .",
    "since the different choices of expansion parameter correspond to different ways of isolating residual higher - order perturbative uncertainties , one expects the results of the two analyses to be in good agreement so long as ( i ) one is working with @xmath20 having small mass - independent np corrections , ( ii ) the same input values are used for both , and ( iii ) residual np and higher - order perturbative uncertainties are indeed small .",
    "the situation is likely to be more complicated for @xmath20 with sizeable estimated @xmath31 gluon condensate corrections .",
    "the results of the hpqcd fit for the three @xmath20 we consider are @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 for @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively  @xcite . all are in good agreement within errors with the corresponding results from our analysis .",
    "this agreement is further improved if one takes into account the small difference in input @xmath34 values .",
    "were we to switch from @xmath46 fm to the central value of the hpqcd determination , @xmath47 fm , all three of our @xmath0 results would decrease by @xmath48 .",
    "note also that use of the central charmonium sum rule input for @xmath35 in our calculation raises the output @xmath0 obtained from @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 by @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "our fitted values would thus be in even closer agreement with those of the hpqcd update were we to impose the hpqcd central zero value of @xmath35 in our fits . since the fitted @xmath39 values obtained by analyzing the various @xmath20 are not quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not possible to quantify further the role of this effect .",
    "the agreement for the three observables under discussion is in any case good , within expectations , independent of this question .",
    "we now turn to a more detailed discussion of the issue of the subtraction of the mass - independent np contributions .",
    "if the estimated lo , @xmath31 gluon condensate subtraction represents only a small fraction of the measured @xmath20 at the scales under consideration , analogous mass - independent np contributions with @xmath52 should be even smaller , and hence safely negligible .",
    "if , however , the estimated @xmath31 correction is sizeable , analogous @xmath52 corrections can no longer be expected to be small .",
    "these necessarily scale differently with lattice spacing than do the @xmath53 perturbative and @xmath31 np contributions and hence , if not included when fitting the data , are likely to force shifts in both @xmath6 and @xmath39 if present at a non - negligible level .",
    "we deal with this potential problem by focussing on @xmath20 for which the impact of the estimated @xmath31 gluon condensate subtraction is small compared to the variation of the @xmath20 in question over the lattice scales employed in the fit . in the initial version of the hpqcd re - analysis , mass - independent np subtractions were estimated using only the @xmath31 gluon condensate form , even for observables where the estimated correction is sizeable . in the more recent update , additional terms , scaling as would mass - independent contributions of @xmath52 , are added to the fit function for each observable , and the accompanying coefficients extracted as part of the augmented bayesian fit .",
    "the impact of including the @xmath52 terms is , as expected , small for those observables having small values of the estimated @xmath31 subtraction . for observables with larger @xmath31 subtractions ,",
    "the fit errors are increased ( by factors of @xmath54 for those observables having the largest @xmath31 corrections ) and some shifts in @xmath0 of order @xmath55 to @xmath56 times the smaller preliminary errors are observed .",
    "the shifts serve to reduce the spread of @xmath0 values compared to that seen in the original version of the re - analysis .",
    "the values of @xmath35 obtained from the independent fits to the different observables are not quoted in ref .",
    "@xcite , but a useful test of the self - consistency of the approach would be to verify that the inclusion of the @xmath52 contributions has brought these values into good agreement with one another .",
    "it is worth noting that the observables , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 , which produce the three smallest results for @xmath0 , have estimated @xmath31 corrections significantly larger than those for any of the other observables .",
    "the magnitudes of the corrections in these cases represent @xmath60 of the variation with scale of the uncorrected @xmath20 between the lightest mass @xmath17 and @xmath61 fm ensembles .",
    "( this variation - with - scale provides a suitable measure for use in assessing the importance of np corrections since it is the variation with scale which provides the input needed to fix the fit parameters , and , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath62 and @xmath11 fm ensembles which dominate the hpqcd re - analysis . )",
    "these observables are thus , for the purposes of the analysis , rather non - perturbative .",
    "were one to exclude observables with larger np contributions from the hpqcd average , on the grounds that the related subtractions introduce additional theoretical systematic uncertainties , the hpqcd result would be brought into even closer agreement with ours , though the resulting shift would in fact be small ( at the @xmath63 quarter @xmath64 level ) .",
    "we stress that , independent of these questions , our results agree well within errors with those of the hpqcd update . this agreement",
    "is further improved by a shift to common input .",
    "we argue that the non - zero central value for @xmath39 obtained from the updated charmonium sum rule analysis represents our best present knowledge of this quantity , and hence also the best choice as input for evaluating the small mass - independent np subtractions needed for extracting @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , for the reasons just discussed , we believe that the most reliable determinations of @xmath0 are those based on those observables for which the @xmath31 correction is as small as possible .",
    "such an assessment produces the results already noted above , which are in extremely good agreement with what it known from other sources .",
