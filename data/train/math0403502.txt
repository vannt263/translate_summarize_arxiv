    "let @xmath4 be the number of permutations of length @xmath5 ( or , in what follows , @xmath5-permutations ) that avoid the pattern @xmath0 .",
    "for a brief introduction to the area of pattern avoidance , see @xcite ; for a more detailed introduction , see @xcite .",
    "a recent spectacular result of marcus and tardos @xcite shows that for any pattern @xmath0 , there exists a constant @xmath6 so that @xmath7 holds for all @xmath5 . as pointed out by arratia in @xcite ,",
    "this is equivalent to the statement that @xmath1{s_n(q)}$ ] exists .",
    "let us call the sequence @xmath8{s_n(q)}$ ] a _ stanley - wilf _ sequence .",
    "it is a natural and intriguing question to ask what the limit @xmath9 of a stanley - wilf sequence can be , for various patterns @xmath0 .",
    "the main reason this question has been so intriguing is that in all cases where @xmath9 has been known , it has been known to be an _",
    "integer_. indeed , the results previously known are listed below .    1 .   when @xmath0 is of length three , then @xmath10",
    "this follows from the well - known fact @xcite that in this case , @xmath11 .",
    "2 .   when @xmath12 , or when @xmath0 is such that @xmath13 , then @xmath14 .",
    "this follows from an asymptotic formula of regev @xcite .",
    "3 .   when @xmath15 , or when @xmath0 is such that @xmath16 , then @xmath17 .",
    "see @xcite for this result and an exact formula for the numbers @xmath18 .    in this paper",
    ", we show that @xmath9 is _ not _ always an integer . we achieve this by proving that @xmath19",
    ". then we compute the exact value of this limit , and see that it is not even rational ; it is the number @xmath20 .",
    "we compute the limit of the stanley - wilf sequence for an infinite sequence of patterns , and see that as the length @xmath2 of these patterns grows , @xmath9 will fall further and further below the largest known possible value , @xmath21 .",
    "finally , we show that while for certain patterns , our methods provide the exact value of the limit of the stanley - wilf sequence , for certain others they only provide a _ lower bound _ on this limit .",
    "this starts explaining why certain patterns are easier to avoid than others . among other results",
    ", we will confirm a seven - year old conjecture by proving that in the sense of logarithmic asymptotics , a layered pattern @xmath0 is always easier to avoid than the monotone pattern of the same length .",
    "let @xmath22 be a permutation . recall that @xmath23 is called a _ left - to - right minimum _ of @xmath24 if @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "in other words , a left - to - right minimum is an entry that is smaller than everything on its left .",
    "note that @xmath27 is always a left - to - right minimum , and so is the entry 1 of @xmath24 .",
    "also note that the left - to - right minima of @xmath24 always form a decreasing sequence .",
    "for the rest of this paper , entries that are not left - to - right minima are called _",
    "remaining entries_.    now we are in a position to prove our promised upper bound for the numbers @xmath28 .",
    "[ lupper ] for all positive integers @xmath5 , we have @xmath29    let @xmath24 be a permutation counted by @xmath28 , and let @xmath24 have @xmath2 left - to - right minima .",
    "then we have at most @xmath30 choices for the set of these left - to - right minima , and we have at most @xmath30 choices for their positions .",
    "the string of the remaining entries has to form a 1342-avoiding permutation of length @xmath31 . indeed ,",
    "if there was a copy @xmath32 of 1342 among the entries that are not left - to - right minima , then we could complete it to a 12453 pattern by simply prepending it by the closest left - to - right minimum that is on the left of @xmath33 .",
    "the number of 1342-avoiding permutations on @xmath31 elements is less than @xmath34 as we know from @xcite .",
    "this shows that @xmath35 and the proof is complete .    [ upper ] we have @xmath36",
    "we have seen in corollary [ upper ] that @xmath37 . in order to prove that this limit is not an integer , it suffices to show that it is larger than 14 . in",
    "what follows , we are going to work towards a good lower bound for the numbers @xmath28 , and thus the number @xmath38 .",
    "where is the waste in the proof of the upper bound in the previous section ?",
    "the waste is that there are some choices for the left - to - right minima that are incompatible with some choices for the 1342-avoiding permutation of the remaining entries .",
    "this is a crucial concept of the upcoming proof , so we will make it more precise .",
    "we have mentioned in the previous section , that determining the left - to - right minima of a permutation @xmath24 means to determine the set @xmath39 of positions these minima will be , and to determine the set @xmath40 of entries that are the left - to - right minima . in other words , the ordered pair @xmath41 of equal - sized subsets of @xmath42=\\{1,2,\\cdots , n\\}$ ] describes the left - to - right minima of @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath5 be a positive integer , and let @xmath43 be a positive integer .",
    "let @xmath39 and @xmath40 be two @xmath44-element subsets of @xmath42 $ ] .",
    "finally , let @xmath45 be a permutation of the elements of the set @xmath42-z$ ] .",
    "if there exists an @xmath5-permutation @xmath24 so that its left - to - right minima are precisely the elements of @xmath40 , they are located in positions belonging to @xmath39 , and its string of remaining entries is @xmath45 , then we say that the triple @xmath46 is _",
    "compatible_. otherwise , we say that the triple @xmath46 is _",
    "incompatible_.    clearly , if @xmath46 is _ compatible _ , then there is exactly one permutation @xmath24 satisfying all criteria specified by @xmath46 .",
    "if @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 , then @xmath46 is _ compatible _ as shown by the permutation 2413 .",
    "if @xmath47 , and @xmath48 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 , then @xmath46 is _",
    "incompatible_. indeed , the only permutation allowed by @xmath39 and @xmath45 is 3214 , but for this permutation @xmath53 , not @xmath54 .",
    "returning to the method by which we proved our upper bound for @xmath38 , we will show that in a sufficient number of cases , our triples @xmath46 are compatible .",
    "this will show that the upper bound is quite close to the precise value of @xmath38 .",
    "what is a good way to check that a particular choice @xmath41 of left - to - right minima is compatible with a particular choice of @xmath45 ? for shortness , let us call the procedure of putting together @xmath45 and a string @xmath41 of left - to - right minima _",
    "merging_. one has to check that in the permutation obtained by merging our left - to - right minima with @xmath45 , the left - to - right minima are indeed the entries in @xmath40 .",
    "that is , there are no additional left - to - right minima , and there the entries in @xmath40 are indeed all left - to - right minima .",
    "this is achieved exactly when any remaining entry is larger than the closest left - to - right minimum on its left .    in our efforts to find a good lower bound on @xmath38",
    ", we will only consider a special kind of permutations .",
    "let @xmath55 be a positive integer so that @xmath56 for all @xmath57 .",
    "( we know from @xcite that such an @xmath55 exists as @xmath58 . )    consider permutations whose string @xmath45 of remaining entries has the following property .",
    "if we cut @xmath45 into @xmath59 blocks of consecutive entries of length @xmath55 each ( the last block can be of size between @xmath55 and @xmath60 ) , then the entries of any given block @xmath61 are all smaller than the entries on any block on the left of @xmath61 , and larger than the entries of any block on the right of @xmath61 .",
    "let us call these strings @xmath45 _ block - structured_. see fig .",
    "[ blocks ] for the generic diagram of a block - structured string in the ( unrealistic ) case of @xmath62 .",
    "the number of such strings @xmath45 is obviously more than @xmath63 .",
    "it is obvious that they are all 1342-avoiding as a 1342-pattern can not start in a block and end in another one .",
    "we claim that a sufficient number of these strings @xmath45 will be compatible with a sufficient number of the choices @xmath41 of left - to - right minima .    first , look at the very special case when @xmath45 is _ decreasing_. in this case , we will write @xmath64 instead of @xmath45",
    ". now our permutation @xmath24 consists of two decreasing sequences ( so it is 123-avoiding ) , namely the left - to - right minima and @xmath64 .",
    "the following proposition is very well - known .",
    "[ pnara ] let @xmath65 .",
    "then the number of 123-avoiding @xmath5-permutations having exactly @xmath44 left - to - right minima is @xmath66 a _ narayana _ number .    for a proof ,",
    "see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the significance of this result for us is the following .",
    "if we just wanted to merge @xmath41 and @xmath45 together , with no regard to the existing constraints , the total number of ways to do that would be of course at most @xmath67 .",
    "the above formula shows that roughly @xmath68 of these mergings will actually be good , that is , they will not violate any constraints , they will lead to compatible triples @xmath46 .",
    "the factor @xmath68 is not a significant loss from our point of view , since @xmath69{1/n}=1 $ ] .",
    "now let us return to the general case of block - structured strings @xmath45 .",
    "in other words , take a 123-avoiding @xmath5-permutation @xmath70 , and replace its string @xmath64 by a block - structured string @xmath45 _ taken on the entries that belong to _ @xmath64 .",
    "we claim that after this replacement , a sufficient number of triples @xmath46 will be compatible .",
    "here is the outline of the proof of that claim . because of the structure of a block - structured @xmath45 , it is true that every entry in @xmath45 is at most @xmath55 positions away from the position it was @xmath64 . therefore , if we merge @xmath41 and @xmath64 together so that each remaining entry @xmath71 is not simply larger than the left - to - right minimum that is closest to and preceding the position @xmath72 of @xmath71 , but also larger than the left - to - right minimum closest to and preceding position @xmath73 , then we will be done . indeed , in this case replacing @xmath64 by any block - structured string @xmath45 will not violate any constraints .",
    "therefore , we will have a lower bound for the number of compatible triples @xmath46 if we find a lower bound for the number of compatible triples @xmath70 in which each remaining entry has the mentioned stronger property .    in order to find such a lower bound ,",
    "take a 123-avoiding permutation @xmath74 which is of length @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath74 have @xmath44 left - to - right minima .",
    "denote @xmath76 the string of the left - to - right minima of @xmath74 , and let @xmath77 denote the decreasing string of remaining entries of @xmath74 . now prepend @xmath74 with the decreasing string taken on the @xmath55-element set @xmath78 , to get an @xmath5-permutation . in this @xmath5-permutation , move each of the original @xmath44 left - to - right minima of @xmath74 to the left by @xmath55 positions .",
    "let us call the obtained @xmath5-permutation @xmath79 .",
    "it is then clear that the left - to - right minima of @xmath79 are the same as the left - to - right minima of @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , because of the translation we used to create our new permutation , @xmath79 has the property that if @xmath71 is a remaining entry of @xmath79 and is in position @xmath72 , then @xmath71 is larger than the left - to - right minimum that is closest to , and preceding , position @xmath73 .",
    "now we can use the argument that we outlined four paragraphs ago . for easy reference",
    ", we sketch that argument again .",
    "if @xmath64 is replaced by any block - structured permutation of the same size taken on the same set of elements , ( resulting in the @xmath5-permutation @xmath80 ) then each remaining entry @xmath71 will move within its block only , that is , @xmath71 will move at most @xmath55 positions from its original position .",
    "therefore , @xmath71 will still be larger than the left - to - right minimum closest to it and preceding it .",
    "this shows that if @xmath74 and @xmath76 lead to a compatible triple , then so too will @xmath80 and @xmath41 , where @xmath41 describes the left - to - right minima of @xmath80 .",
    "proposition [ pnara ] implies that the number of compatible triples @xmath81 is @xmath82 . as @xmath55 is a constant , we have @xmath83 { \\frac{1}{m}{n - n\\choose m}{n",
    "- n \\choose m+1}}\\ ] ]    now restrict our attention to the particular case when @xmath84 .",
    "we claim that permutations of this particular type are sufficiently numerous to provide the lower bound we need . using stirling s formula , a routine computation yields that in this case , we have @xmath83{{n\\choose m}{n\\choose m } } = \\left(\\frac{3^n}{2^{2n/3}}\\right ) ^2 \\geq 1.88^{2n}.\\ ] ] besides",
    ", we have more than @xmath85 choices for the block - structured string @xmath45 by which we replace @xmath64 . therefore , we have proved the following lower bound .",
    "[ lower ] for @xmath5 sufficiently large , the number of @xmath5-permutations of length @xmath5 that avoid the pattern 12453 is larger than @xmath86    lemma [ lower ] and corollary [ upper ] together immediately yield the following .",
    "we have @xmath87 in particular , @xmath88{s_n(12453)}$ ] is not an integer .",
    "if we are a little bit more careful with our choice of @xmath44 in the argument of the previous section , we can find the exact value of @xmath38 .",
    "it turns out to be the upper bound proved in corollary [ upper ] .",

    "now that the stanley - wilf conjecture has been proved , and we know that the limit of a stanley - wilf sequence always exists , we can ask what the largest possible value of this limit is , in terms of @xmath2 . in @xcite , r. arratia conjectured that this limit is at most @xmath21 , and , following the footsteps of erds , he offered 100 dollars for a proof or disproof of the conjecture @xmath169 , for all @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "our results provide some additional support for this conjecture as they show that there is a wide array of patterns @xmath0 for which @xmath121 grows by one when @xmath0 is prepended by the entry 1 .",
