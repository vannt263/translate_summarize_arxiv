    "the coherent control of quantum systems continues to be a topic of great interest .",
    "the possibility of maintaining a spin in a coherent state is of extreme importance in fields of application like nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) or the manipulation of quantum dots . in particular for quantum information processing , a long coherence time of the qubit",
    "is an indispensable prerequisite for its realization .    a quantum bit ( henceforth : qubit ) is a two - level system which is conveniently regarded as a spin @xmath0",
    ". operations on qubits to change or to correct their state are performed through quantum gates .",
    "their effect on the density matrix of the qubit can be described as a rotation in the bloch sphere .",
    "experimentally , they often can be obtained by the application of electromagnetic pulses .",
    "a 1-qubit gate is generally a single rotation about a given axis @xmath1 in spin space .",
    "the angle of rotation classifies the type of the pulse . for instance a @xmath2 pulses rotates the spin by 180@xmath3 .",
    "these pulses find a wide range of applications in dynamical decoupling @xcite and in nmr @xcite where also @xmath4 pulses are crucial .",
    "in quantum information processing the @xmath4 pulse in combination with a @xmath2 pulse realizes the important hadamard gate .",
    "the idea of dynamical decoupling ( dd ) @xcite has been developed from the spin echo technique in nmr @xcite .",
    "dd aims at decoupling the qubit from the environment by means of the application of appropriate pulse sequences . from a theoretical point of view",
    "the topic has been widely studied and many different sequences of pulses have been proposed . among these we recall the series of periodic equidistant @xmath2 pulses , called bang - bang control ( bb ) @xcite , the periodically iterated 2-pulse sequence according to carr / purcell and meiboom / gill ( cpmg ) @xcite , the concatenated sequence ( cdd ) proposed by khodjasteh and lidar @xcite as well as the fully optimized sequence ( udd ) derived by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the spin echo and the cpmg sequence are standard in nmr @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , other sequences have not yet been tested . in realizations of qubits on the basis of semiconductor technology so far only the spin echo technique has been implemented @xcite .",
    "but computations for quantum dot systems show that more elaborate pulse sequences are very likely to be useful in suppressing decoherence , see for instance @xcite .",
    "most theoretical examples ( for exceptions see ref .",
    "@xcite ) reported so far have the limitation that the pulses are assumed to be ideal .",
    "this means that the pulses are considered to be instantaneous and infinitely strong in the sense of a @xmath5 peak . in this case , one is allowed to ignore the effect of the bath , inducing the decoherence , during the action of the pulse because the coupling to the bath is negligible relative to the amplitude of the @xmath5 pulse .",
    "hence the rotation due to the pulse can be viewed to be completely separate from the free evolution of the system , qubit and bath , without pulse .    if the pulse has a finite duration ( @xmath6 ) so that its time of application is comparable with the characteristic time scales of the bath , the separation between evolution due to the pulse and evolution of the undriven system is not valid anymore . if we suppose that the duration @xmath6 is still small an expansion in @xmath6 about the limit of a @xmath5 pulse is appropriate .",
    "the proposed scenario @xcite establishes an equivalence , up to corrections expanded in a series in @xmath6 , between the real pulse and an ideal @xmath5 pulse at some intermediate instant @xmath7 with @xmath8 , see figs .",
    "[ pulsespi ] , [ pulsespi2 ] , and [ pulsespi2nd ] . before and after the ersatz pulse at @xmath7 , the free evolution of the system , qubit and bath , without pulse takes place .",
    "the corrections expanded in powers of @xmath6 depend also on the shape of the pulse ; so one can aim at making them vanish or at minimizing them by shaping the pulses skillfully .",
    "this is the route that we established previously @xcite analytically by the expansion in @xmath6 . in the present work ,",
    "we demonstrate numerically that the higher order corrections neglected in the analytical calculations are indeed negligible .",
    "thereby , we have shown not only the validity of the previous analytic calculation but we have also demonstrated that the real performance of the proposed pulses is advantageous .",
    "we draw the readers attention to the fact that shaped pulses have been introduced in nmr previously , see for instance the refs .   and ref .",
    "for an overview in the field of quantum information .",

    "in order to disentangle the actual pulse and the free evolution of the system we proceed as follows . the total unitary time evolution during the real pulse is split into the time evolution of the system alone and of the pulse alone which is taken to occur at @xmath7 within the interval @xmath12 $ ] , see ref .  .",

    "they can be expanded in a series in @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to stress that this technique does not aim at eliminating the coupling between the qubit and the bath completely , but only at separating the effect of the pulse from that of bath .",
    "the coupling between the qubit and the bath remains active during the free evolution of the system .    to be explicit , we consider the following general hamiltonian @xmath13 where the hamiltonian @xmath14 of the qubit coupled to the bath is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a completely general bath and @xmath17 a completely general coupling operator acting on the bath .",
