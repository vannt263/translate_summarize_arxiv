    "the quantum xy spin chain and its extensions have been studied for a very long time and from many different perspectives .",

    "first of all , it is possible to obtain an exact solution ( for spin one - half case ) in the language of non - interacting fermions @xcite .",
    "it is interesting for its own , and moreover it can be used in testing various techniques that are applied to a wide range of non - integrable systems @xcite .",
    "another motivation is to use the model to describe the experimental data of quasi - one - dimensional systems @xcite . and",
    "finally , in recent years the xy chain has been extensively examined in the context of quantum information theory , quantum entropy and entanglement @xcite  @xcite .",
    "the solution of the quantum spin one - half xy model is based on the jordan - wigner transformation . by means of this transformation",
    ", the hamiltonian can be brought to a form that describes a system of non - interacting fermions .",
    "this method has been used in seminal paper by lieb , schulz and mattis @xcite , where the anisotropic xy model without magnetic field was studied .",
    "another important papers generalizing and extending the results of @xcite are : an exact solution of quantum ising chain in transverse magnetic field @xcite , the ground - state phase diagram of the anisotropic xy model in transverse magnetic field @xcite , the explicit expression for the ground - state energies @xcite , extensive computations of the correlation functions @xcite , a simple and short derivation of the formulae for numerous observables @xcite , the exact results for xyz model in magnetic field @xcite .    the basic aim of our paper is to examine the _ differentiability properties _ of the expression for the ground state energy , which boils down to the study of the ground - state phase transitions order .",
    "this formula , expressible in terms of elliptic integrals has been known for quite a long time @xcite , but some physical corollaries are , to our best knowledge , lacking .",
    "let us next present a detailed study of these aspects of the ground state formula in comparison to the phase diagram of the xy model @xcite . the phase diagram is shown on fig .",

    "the second line _ ii ) _ corresponds to the change of the direction of magnetization and is in the universality class of two decoupled ising models @xcite .",
    "the third line corresponds to the transition between the ferromagnetic and oscillatory phases . in the literature ,",
    "some rather vague assertions concerning the nature of this transition have been formulated : the thermodynamic functions do not exhibit singularities on this line @xcite , but no derivation has been given .",
    "the expression for the ground state energy allows one to deduce that it is _ infinitely differentiable _ on this line . in this aspect ,",
    "the transition between ferromagnetic and oscillatory phases resembles the kosterlitz - thouless one , but other aspects of these two transitions turned out to be quite different .",

    "however , as we have shown in previous paragraph , the ground state energy is smooth on the aforementioned circle .",
    "such a behaviour resembles the _ kosterlitz - thouless transition _ , where certain thermodynamic quantities are smooth .",
    "so one can ask whether this transition is present in the considered xy spin chain .",
    "let us shortly review the main properties of the k - t transition , necessary to verify this hypothesis .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition occurs in many two - dimensional classical models : coulomb gas , sine - gordon , xy and many others @xcite .",
    "there is no spontaneous symmetry breaking and the free energy , although non - analytic , is infinitely differentiable during this transition .",
    "the singular part of the free energy behaves as : @xmath100 near the critical temperature @xmath101 ( @xmath102 is a positive constant ) .",
    "the kosterlitz - thouless transition occurs also in ground states of one - dimensional quantum chains under change of certain parameter @xmath103 ( for instance , an anisotropy parameter in the quantum xxz chain @xcite ; the @xmath104 quantum chain @xcite ; the ashkin - teller chain @xcite , @xcite ; spin-1 heisenberg models @xcite ) . in all cases ,",
    "the ground - state energy is infinitely differentiable , and the energy gap @xmath105 over the ground state behaves near the critical value of parameter @xmath106 as @xmath107 ( @xmath102 is a positive constant ) .",
    "the physical origin of the kosterlitz - thouless sometimes is clear @xcite , but sometimes is somewhat hidden @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so we decided to check whether the k - t transition is present in the xy model . in the following paragraph",
    ", we will investigate the aforementioned gap energy i.e. the difference between the energy of the first excited state and the energy of the ground state .",
    "first , we will reproduce in an alternative way the well known result regarding the periodic chain .",
    "then , we will show the results of the numerical calculations for an open chain , which reveal that the behaviour of the energy gap is qualitatively the same in both cases .",
    "while the energy gap for the cyclic chain is well - studied , the open chain , to our best knowledge , has not yet been investigated .",
    "the main reason for this is the lack of the translational symmetry , which makes the exact diagonalization far more difficult . from equation ( [ ham_diag ] )",
    ", one can easily see that the gap energy is given by the minimal eigenvalue of the hamiltonian @xmath108 let us first reexamine the case of the @xmath109-cyclic boundary conditions . in order to find the minimal eigenvalue ( equation ( [ gap_general ] ) ) in the limit of @xmath110 ,",
    "one has to solve the equation @xmath111 , i.e. @xmath112 the gap energy in then given by @xmath113 and it is clear that it does not describe the kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "this result is consistent with the first - order of the expansion for the energy gap , which was derived in @xcite .",
    "let us next switch our attention to the open boundary conditions .",
    "the hamiltonian of an open chain after the jordan - wigner transformation is given by ( [ ham_open ] ) .",
    "because of the lack of the translational symmetry , the exact diagonalization of the fermionic hamiltonian is more difficult , i.e. eigenvalues of one - particle problem are not analytically known for arbitrary @xmath7 .",
    "however , one can do the numerical diagonalization .",
    "the numerical calculations show that also in the case of an open chain , the gap energy behaves like @xmath114 for sufficiently long chains .",
    "the exemplary plots depicting this phenomenon are shown in figure [ fig : gap_n ] , where the line @xmath115 was fitted .",
    ".47     .47     the fitted values of @xmath116 are equal to zero within the accuracy of @xmath117 and @xmath118 respectively .",
    "the values of parameter @xmath119 are also fitted very accurately - up to the magnitude of @xmath120 and @xmath121 respectively .",
    "since @xmath116 is zero in the whole range of parameters , there is no kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "however , the behaviour of @xmath122 in the limit or large @xmath7 , i.e. parameter @xmath119 from equation ( [ gap_fit ] ) , varies significantly on the choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "however , in the strong - field region , @xmath78 , plots on figure ( [ fig : gap_n ] ) suggest that @xmath123 regardless on the choice of the boundary conditions .",
    "it turns out that the behaviour of energy gap in the considered xy chain is _ not _ compatible with behaviour described by ( [ ktinqchains ] ) .",
    "it is so due to the following reasons .    *",
    "consider the ordered phase , i.e. @xmath124 ( and @xmath74 ) . in this ordered phase",
    ", the system exhibits the @xmath125 symmetry @xcite ( corresponding to plus and minus sign of magnetization ) , which implies the ( asymptotic ) degeneracy of two ground states .",
    "so , the energy gap is zero in the ordered phase ( in the thermodynamic limit ) . *",
    "consider the oscillating phase ( i.e. @xmath126 ) and take the line @xmath127const .",
    "it turns out that along this line , the gap _",
    "oscillates_. such a behaviour has been observed in @xcite ; we illustrate it on fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_n ] .",
    "moreover , for all values of @xmath1 , the gap tends to 0 in the thermodynamic limit .",
    ".47   can be seen . moreover , with the raise of the chain length the gap tends to zero and the oscillations are faster . for a detailed description ,",
    "see @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    .47   can be seen .",

    "moreover , with the raise of the chain length the gap tends to zero and the oscillations are faster . for a detailed description ,",
    "see @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we have confirmed numerically that the value of energy gap , extrapolated to @xmath128 , _ is zero_. this observation precludes ( in a numerical manner ) the occurrence of the kosterlitz - thouless transition in the xy chain .",
    "the distinguishing feature of k - t transition is the exponential closing of the gap together with the smoothness of ground - state energy at the transition point . in our case ,",
    "energy gap is asymptotically zero in the neighbourhood of transition point , therefore the gap is not an appropriate object for testing analyticity of the ground - state energy . intuitively , one could conjecture that the non - analyticity combined with the smoothness of ground - state energy should be somehow related to the structure of energy levels , but we are not able to specify such a relation .",
    "more precisely , we do nt know how to formulate asymptotic behaviour of energy levels in the neighbourhood of the circle @xmath5 , and leave this as an open problem .",
    "we only conclude that the transition between oscillating and ferromagnetic phases is not of the kosterlitz - thouless type .",
    "we have analysed the the formula for ground - state energy of the anisotropic xy model in transverse magnetic field .",
    "we have examined differentiability properties of the expression .",
    "it turned out that the second derivative of energy ( i.e. the transverse susceptibility ) is logarithmically divergent in the neighbourhood of the lines @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this behaviour is characteristic for ising - type phase transition .",
    "this fact has been known earlier ( see for instance @xcite ) , but here one can obtain sub - leading exponents and amplitudes up to arbitrary order . we have presented some of first terms of such an expansion .    an interesting open problem ( as far as we know ) is the question of _ universality _ of ising - type critical behaviour near these lines .",
    "the universality principle has been formulated more than 40 years ago , but rigorous proofs are very rare .",
    "one of such results is the proof of universality for 2d ising model due to spencer @xcite",
    ". it would be very interesting to adapt the technique used in @xcite to quantum xy chain , for lines @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "on the physical grounds , such universality is expected , but  as far as we know  the rigorous proof is lacking .",
    "we have also established that the energy is differentiable up to arbitrary order on the line @xmath5 .",
    "again , it is interesting to check whether this behaviour is stable ( universal ) against perturbations of hamiltonian .",
    "another aspect of the smoothness of energy on the line @xmath5 , it is interesting to confront this result with paper @xcite , where differentiability property of _ renyi entropy _ has been analysed .",
    "the result there is that derivative of renyi entropy is discontinuous on the line @xmath5 .",
    "apparently , differentiability properties of energy and entropy are different .",
    "it seems strange and it would be interesting to take a closer look at this question .    * acknowledgments .",
