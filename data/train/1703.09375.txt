    "however , the photon - photon interaction in the vacuum is very weak , and people often manipulate photons by utilizing photon - atom interaction . in the past decades , strong photon - atom interaction has been achieved by confining the photons in the high - quality optical microcavity @xcite . recently , photon transport in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) waveguide coupled to quantum emitters , known as waveguide quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , has been widely studied @xcite , which provides a promising candidate for realizing strong light - matter interactions .",

    "interestingly , due to destructive quantum interference , the resonant frequency component of the photon is completely reflected by the quantum emitter . later",
    ", several approaches are proposed to calculate single - photon transport in a 1d waveguide coupled to a two - level emitter , such as the input - output theory @xcite , lippmann - schwinger scattering method @xcite , and the time - dependent theory @xcite . moreover ,",
    "the scattering of a single photon by a driven @xmath0-type three - level emitter coupled to a 1d waveguide has been also studied @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the single emitter case , the system composed of a single photon scattered by multiple emitters is more complicated and interesting , where quantum interference effects from multiple emitters dominates . in 2008 , by solving the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian in the single excitation subspace , tsoi and law @xcite investigated the interaction between a single photon and a chain of @xmath1 equally spaced two - level atoms inside a 1d waveguide .",

    "different from the previous work where the emitters are equally spaced , in our system , the atoms are randomly located in the lattice along the axis of the 1d waveguide , which closely corresponds to the experimental condition that the positions of artificial atoms can not be manipulated precisely due to inevitable technological spreading of the parameters . since both the transmission and reflection of a single photon are fluctuant with the changeable configurations of the atomic positions and single - shot spectrum is often unavailable due to finite trap lifetimes , we take the average values from a large sample of the atomic positions .    in this paper , we first assume that the input photon is a plane wave with single frequency and calculate the transport properties of a three - level atomic ensemble coupled to a 1d waveguide . then , we consider a single photon with gaussian shape and study the optical properties with the parameters of our system , such as the driving field , the coupling strength between atomic ensemble and the 1d waveguide , lattice constant , and the number of the atoms .",
    "it is interesting to note that our system may find application in quantum information technology , such as a single - photon frequency filter . besides , since atoms are randomly placed in the lattice , we analyse the variance of the transmission as a function of the frequency detuning , concluding that the influence of the atomic positions on transport properties changes with frequency detuning .",

    "different from the previous work where the atoms are equally spaced , in our scheme , the atoms are randomly located in the lattice along the axis of the 1d waveguide , which closely corresponds to the practical condition that the atomic positions can not be controlled precisely in experiment due to inevitable technological spreading of the parameters . since the transport properties is fluctuant with the various configurations of the atomic positions and single - shot spectrum is often not available because of finite trap lifetimes , we adopt the average optical properties from a large sample of the atomic positions .",
    "assuming that the incident photon is a plane wave with single frequency , we first calculate the transmission and reflection spectrums , concluding that the scattering properties of our system are quite different from the case that the atoms are equally spaced with a deterministic separation .",
    "then , we adopt a photon with gaussian shape as the incident pulse , and analyse the rich optical properties with the parameters , such as the number of the atoms , the driving field , lattice constant @xmath2 , and coupling strength @xmath58",
    ". our system may find application in quantum information technology , such as a single - photon frequency filter .",
    "we also study the variance of the transmission caused by the atomic positions , which exhibits different influence of atomic positions on the scattering properties with different detuning .",
    "moreover , we calculate the photon - photon correlation of the output fields generated by the scattering between photons and atomic ensemble coupled to the 1d waveguide , which shows non - classical behavior such as bunching and anti - bunching . that is , the scattering between a single photon and atomic ensemble may provide an effective method for generating non - classical light in experiment .",
