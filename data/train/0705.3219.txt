    "the recent studies of the consequences of the acceleration induced by stellar jets on extrasolar planets and protoplanetary disks ( namouni 2005 , 2007 , hereafter papers i , ii ; namouni and zhou 2006 ) have shown that the basic dynamics of these systems rely on the accelerated kepler problem ( hereafter akp ) .",
    "although it is uncommon in celestial mechanics , the problem obtained by adding a constant acceleration to one of the two bodies in an @xmath0 potential is at the basis of the stark effect in quantum mechanics ( brandsen and joachain 1989 ) . in this case",
    ", the acceleration models the constant electric field applied to an atom .",
    "an interesting property of the akp is its integrability .",
    "this result was obtained by epstein ( 1916 ) who used the hamilton - jacobi appraoch in terms of parabolic coordinates to separate the akp into two unidimensional hamiltonians ( landau and lifschitz 1969 ) .",
    "the integrability of the akp in the position ",
    "velocity space was expressed by redmond ( 1964 ) who derived a generalized runge - lenz invariant for the stark effect .",
    "this invariant together with the energy and the angular momentum component along the direction of acceleration are the three integrals of the akp .",
    "recently , it was recognized that some of the dynamical consequences of time - variable jet - induced acceleration on the evolution of accretion disks and the forming planets they contain can be ascertained from the akp ( i.e. from the dynamics associated with a time - independent acceleration ) . to this end ,",
    "analytical derivations in terms of the physical variables ( positions , velocities , orbital elements ) as well as perturbation theory through secular averaging and sudden impulse methods were used to determine the eccentricity and inclination excitation of extrasolar planets ( paper i ) as well as the vertical profile of jet - sustaining accretion disks ( paper ii ) .",
    "the use of parabolic coordinates has the advantage of reducing the akp into two integrable unidimensional problems .",
    "this however comes at a price : parabolic coordinates are not physical .",
    "consequently , the aim of this paper is to link the two analytical approaches of perturbation theory and parabolic coordinates in order to give a canonical interpretation of the physical properties described in the works mentioned above .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we show how the akp arises in keplerian systems with asymmetric momentum loss . in section 3 , we compare some of the akp s simple qualitative features to those of the classical kepler problem .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the akp s formulation in parabolic coordinates .",
    "the secular resonance at the basis of the eccentricity excitation of extrasolar planets is studied in section 5 and its origin in the non - averaged problem is given in terms of parabolic coordinates . in section 6",
    ", we derive the dependence of the keplerian boundary radius on the initial inclination for circular orbits .",
    "section 7 contains further directions of research in the akp .",
    "consider a two - body kepler problem where the larger mass object is loosing linear momentum at the constant rate @xmath1 .",
    "the equations of motion of the two bodies in an inertial frame are given as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 are the masses , positions and velocities of the two bodies and @xmath4 is the gravitational constant . in terms of the center of mass and relative motion coordinates , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and the corresponding velocities , @xmath7 , the equations of motion are written as : @xmath8 these equations show that the motion of the center of mass is accelerated in the inertial frame by an amount equal to the ratio of the momentum loss rate to the total mass of the system .",
    "the relative motion of the small body remains independent of the center of mass s motion while it is accelerated in the opposite direction to momentum loss by the ratio of the momentum loss rate to the central mass .",
    "calling @xmath9 the constant acceleration of the relative motion and dropping the index @xmath10 for simplicity , the relative motion of the smaller object around the larger one is given by : @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "this equation defines the accelerated kepler problem .",
    "it describes the dynamical evolution of a planet embedded in a jet - sustaining disk that looses mass and linear momentum from its inner parts ( the so - called jet launching region , paper ii ) .",
    "as the perturbing acceleration is constant , the dynamical problem described by ( [ motion ] ) remains conservative and amounts to the addition of the potential @xmath13 to the two - body kepler problem .",
    "this in turn gives the energy integral of the akp as : @xmath14 the acceleration @xmath15 defines a preferred direction in the akp . as a result ,",
    "the projection of the specific angular momentum @xmath16 along this direction , @xmath17 is conserved as @xmath18 . the third integral ( redmond 1964 )",

    "we choose a reference frame where the @xmath22axis is directed along @xmath15 . using the conservation of @xmath23 , the energy integral ( [ energy ] ) can be written as :    @xmath24    and where @xmath25 and @xmath22 are the usual cylindrical coordinates in the plane orthogonal to @xmath15 . for a given value of @xmath23 ,",

    "orbits that are set up near the unstable point such as that in figures 7 and 8 of paper i tend to escape after a long time ( relative to the orbital period ) only because of the discrete nature of the numerical scheme used to integrate the orbit . in section 6 ,",
    "we discuss further the outer boundary of initially circular orbits whose orbital plane is inclined to the direction of acceleration such as those studied in paper i. before doing so , we first introduce the formulation of the akp in parabolic coordinates that will be needed in sections 5 and 6 .",

    "the level curves of @xmath71 bear a strong resemblance to the zero - velocity curves of the akp in cylindrical coordinates ( fig .",

    "the physical setting of the akp is useful in identifying the dynamical response of a planet embedded in a accretion disk that sustains an asymmetric jet system .",
    "such planets form inside the gas disk on circular planar orbits .",
    "as the disk s state of least energy is the sombrero profile ( paper ii ) , the formed planet may assume one of the circular sombrero orbits and is therefore immune to any additional dynamical excitation from the acceleration of the star - disk system .",
    "in order to account for the large eccentricity of extrasolar planets through the akp , the `` initial '' planetary orbital plane must be inclined with respect the direction of acceleration in order to display the librations described by the two hamiltonians ( eqn .",
    "[ hm1 ] and [ hm2 ] ) .",
    "the possible physical realization of this geometry is when the jet system is inclined with respect to the star s rotation axis and therefore precesses around it . in this case",
    ", the acceleration has a constant vertical component that defines the sombrero profile and a precessing component that may excite the eccentricity of a planet embedded in the disk .",
    "this was the premise of paper i where the excitation of eccentricity and inclination of extrasolar planets that formed in a jet - sustaining disk was examined .    to illustrate the eccentricity excitation of a planet on an initially circular planar orbit , it is instructive to first consider the situation where the precession frequency is so small that the acceleration appears to maintain a constant inclination with respect to the planetary orbit . in the context of the akp , studying the excitation due to an inclined constant direction acceleration amounts to choosing initially inclined circular planetary orbits in the presence of a vertical acceleration .    to examine this situation ,",
    "the akp was viewed in paper i as a classical two - body kepler problem perturbed by the acceleration @xmath15 .",
    "working in the secular regime where the excitation time @xmath83 is much larger than the orbital period @xmath84 , the acceleration potential @xmath85 was averaged over the orbital period to find : @xmath86 where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are the orbital eccentricity and semi - major axis .",

    "this was shown to be the case in paper i where orbits were integrated numerically with the full equations of motion ( i.e. without averaging ) and a good match was found between the numerical evolution and equation ( [ eoft ] ) for initially circular orbits .    to understand the origin of the secular resonance in terms of parabolic coordinates , we numerically integrated the equations of motion ( [ motion ] ) for orbits that were initially placed at exact resonance as defined by the osculating orbital elements given by ( [ exactres ] ) .",
