    "rr lyrae type variable stars are well - known tracers of old and metal - poor populations .",
    "they play an essential role in the understanding of the structure , formation , and evolution of the milky way .",
    "multi - epoch observations allow easy identification of this type of variable , in particular of high - amplitude fundamental - mode rrab type stars with characteristic tooth - shaped light curves . based on a large number of observations",
    "one can determine their properties with high precision , such as period , metallicity , interstellar reddening , distance , and spatial distribution .",
    "thousands of rr lyrae stars have been discovered in the galactic bulge , thick disk , and halo .",
    "observations of the halo variables ( e.g. @xcite ) indicate that it probably consists of two overlapping populations ( @xcite ) and is full of substructures from tidally disrupted dwarf galaxies such as the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal ( sgr dsph ) galaxy ( ) .",
    "central regions of the milky way have been intensively monitored by the optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) since the early 1990s ( @xcite ) . since 2010",
    "march the project has been in its fourth phase ( ogle - iv , * ? ? ?",
    "with the survey area increasing in each of the previous phases , the number of detected rr lyrae variables toward the galactic bulge has increased significantly : 215 stars in ogle - i ( e.g. @xcite ) , 2713 stars in ogle - ii ( @xcite ) , and 16,836 stars in ogle - iii ( @xcite ) .",
    "the ogle - iii collection consisted of 11,756 fundamental - mode ( rrab ) , 4989 first - overtone ( rrc ) , and 91 double - mode ( rrd ) stars .",
    "the analysis of that sample by @xcite showed that the bulge rr lyrae stars seem to constitute a uniform population with a sharply peaked metallicity distribution centered at @xmath3$}}=-1.02\\pm0.18 $ ]  dex on the @xcite metallicity scale .",
    "a comparison of the distributions of the dereddened brightness of rr lyrae stars and red clump ( rc ) giants indicated that in the inner regions ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) the rr lyrae stars tend to follow the barred structure of rc stars inclined at an angle of about @xmath6 with respect to the line of sight between the sun and the galactic center ( gc ) ( ) .    @xcite combined @xmath7-band ogle measurements with the near - ir @xmath8-band data from the vista variables in the via lactea ( vvv ) survey ( @xcite ) for 7663 ogle - iii rrab variables in order to refine the spatial distribution of the old bulge population .",
    "these authors claim that the population of rr lyrae stars has a nearly spherical distribution , slightly elongated in its central part almost toward us .",
    "they obtained a distance to the gc of @xmath9  kpc and an inclination angle of @xmath10 .",
    "very recently , @xcite presented a collection of 38,257 rr lyrae variable stars detected in the ogle fields covering over 182  deg@xmath11 of the central regions of the galactic bulge . in this",
    "set , 21,453 rr lyrae stars are newly discovered objects in ogle - iv .",
    "the collection consists of 27,258 rrab , 10,825 rrc , and 174 rrd stars . in this paper",
    ", we study the spatial structure of the old galactic bulge based on the whole available sample of the detected rrab type stars from the ogle survey .",
    "variables of this type are on average brighter , have higher amplitudes , and thanks to their characteristic saw - tooth - shaped light curves are hard to overlook in comparison to first - overtone sinusoidal - like rrc pulsators .",
    "we also use the new large sample of rrab type variables to investigate population properties of the milky way old bulge . in early studies ,",
    "classical bulges were assumed to be characterized by single stellar populations whose stars formed on short timescales ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , modern spectroscopic studies have revealed a more complex picture of star formation history via collapse , mergers , and secular processes ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "rr lyr stars as tracers of old populations may help to identify the dominant mechanism responsible for the early formation of our galaxy .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the cleaning procedure of the sample . in section",
    "[ sec : sky ] , we analyze the observed distribution of the bulge rrab stars on the sky . the analysis of the spatial structure is included in section  [ sec:3d ] . in section  [ sec :",
    "metal ] , we investigate the photometric metallicity gradient . in section  [ sec : multipop ] , we present the discovery of multiple old populations among the bulge rr lyrae stars .",
    "finally , section  [ sec : conc ] states the main conclusions of this work .",
    "prior to the analysis of the bulge rr lyrae stars the original sample from @xcite required several cleaning steps . from the whole sample of 27,258 rrab variables",
    ", we rejected 54 stars as bona fide members and very likely members of eight globular clusters ( ngc 6441 , ngc 6522 , ngc 6540 , ngc 6553 , ngc 6558 , ngc 6569 , ngc 6642 , and ngc 6656 ) .",
    "this procedure was based on @xcite catalog of variable stars in galactic globular clusters and its 2010 update . from the original list",
    ", we also rejected object ogle - blg - rrlyr-02792 which was recently confirmed to be a low - mass binary component mimicking an rr lyrae pulsator ( @xcite ) .    in the next step",
    ", we cleaned the bulge sample from foreground and background rr lyrae stars by constructing the color - magnitude ( @xmath12 , @xmath7 ) diagram ( upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) . due to different reddening toward observed regions",
    "the bulge stars form a long sequence in the diagram . by drawing three lines we roughly delimited bulge rr lyrae variables from background stars ( line at @xmath13 ) , foreground stars ( line at @xmath14 ) , and stars with unreliable color ( vertical line at @xmath15  mag ) .",
    "most of the background objects are variables from the sgr dsph galaxy .",
    "other background variables and all foreground variables very likely belong to the milky way thick disk and halo .",
    "binning of the bulge data shows that the sequence is clearly linear for @xmath16  mag ( lower panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) and can be described with the following relation : @xmath17 where its slope is the total - to - selective extinction @xmath18 .",
    "it is 0.06 higher than the one found based on a sample from the ogle - iii data that was a factor od two smaller ( @xcite ) .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath19 is consistent with the fact that the interstellar extinction toward the bulge is anomalous ( @xcite ) .",
    "color ( blue points ) shows that the bulge sequence is practically linear for @xmath16  mag and complete down to @xmath20  mag ( lower panel).,width=321 ]    the mean brightness of the bulge sequence clearly departs from linear at @xmath21  mag or @xmath22  mag .",
    "hence , we assume that our sample of rrab stars is complete down to @xmath20  mag . the total number of bulge variables with measured mean brightnesses in @xmath23 and @xmath7 amounts to 21,026 objects .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapbulge ] , we show a map with positions in galactic coordinates of all ogle rr lyrae variables with available @xmath24 data and distinguish between stars brighter and fainter than @xmath20  mag .",
    "these stars concentrate toward the gc , but due to high extinction they are not observed in the optical regime close to the galactic plane . by drawing two lines we set borders of two areas , north and south of the plane , in which , as we assume , all bulge rrab stars have been detected within the ogle bulge fields . in our analysis of the old bulge structure ,",
    "we rely only on objects from the `` complete '' directions .",
    "the whole `` complete '' area amounts to 90.5  deg@xmath11 .     and @xmath7 band .",
    "black points are stars with a mean brightness of @xmath25  mag , while green ones are those with a mean brightness of @xmath26  mag .",

    "complete  areas , toward which , as we assume , all rrab stars have been detected ( north of the upper line and south of the lower one ) and an  incomplete  stripe along the galactic plane due to high extinction.,width=321 ]",
    "based on the ogle - iii data @xcite evidently confirmed an earlier finding by @xcite that the bulge rr lyrae population is flattened along galactic longitude . from the difference in longitudinal and latitudinal surface density profiles , @xcite derived an axis ratio of @xmath27 . for the present `` complete '' area covering 50% of the sky within an angular radius of @xmath28 around the gc and 28% within @xmath29",
    ", we can carry out a more accurate determination of the observed on the sky shape of the old bulge .",
    "we counted stars in cells in a radial coordinate system around @xmath30 .",
    "the cells were spaced every @xmath31 in azimuth and they were @xmath32 long in radius .",
    "we sampled every @xmath33 in radial distance between @xmath34 and @xmath35 from the center .",
    "the density in each cell was corrected for surface coverage .",
    "cells covering less then 80% of the `` complete '' directions were not taken into account .",
    "results of the surface density determination are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib ] , where centers of the cells are represented by points in five different colors .",
    "the colors code five density ranges . to the points from the same density range we fitted ellipses with the centers on the galactic equator and described by the semimajor axis @xmath36 and semiminor axis @xmath37 .",
    "the obtained flattening @xmath38 in a function of @xmath36 is plotted in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : distrib ] .",
    "it does not seem to change with the increasing distance , hence we assume it to be constant at a mean value of @xmath39 .",
    "the most important implication from the observed surface density distribution of the rr lyrae stars is that the old bulge is not spherically symmetric ",
    "it is ellipsoidal .",
    "the uncertainty of the flattening @xmath40 is much larger than the effects of spherical projection .",
    "these effects are comparable to the obtained @xmath41 at a distance of about @xmath6 .",
    "they are negligible at radial distances up to @xmath42 from the center .     from the galactic center .",
    "constant density lines are ellipses with the major axis along the galactic equator . their centers are marked with small circles representing the uncertainty .",

    "[ fig : prof2d ] , we present the radial surface density profile for the bulge rrab stars .",
    "we counted stars in equally spaced annuli in a logarithmic angular distance scale from the center at @xmath30 .",
    "the data were corrected for completeness and scaled to the minor ( vertical ) axis @xmath37 ( @xmath44 ) by the factor @xmath45 . in the upper panel ,",
    "we show the results in units of degrees , while in the lower one , we convert the units of degrees to kiloparsecs by adopting the distance to the gc obtained further in section  [ sec:3d ] , @xmath46  kpc .",
    "the ogle data span angular distances between @xmath47 and @xmath48 or linear distances from about 0.22  kpc to 2.8  kpc from the gc .",
    "as one can see , the surface density profile of rrab stars in this galactocentric distance range can be represented by a single power law : @xmath49 this result is much more precise than the one presented in @xcite where the sky coverage and the rrab sample were significantly smaller and variables were counted in ogle - iii fields as units . here we see that there is no break in the density distribution at a distance of 0.5  kpc from the gc , as reported in the earlier work .     and scaled to the minor axis in units of degrees ( upper panel ) and kpc ( lower panel ) assuming the distance to the galactic center @xmath50 determined in section .",

    "in this section , we derive parameters describing the spatial structure of the rr lyrae population . to obtain distances to individual stars we have to correct their brightness for reddening .",
    "we calculated dereddened mean magnitudes using @xmath51 where the extinction @xmath52 was derived from the following formula introduced in @xcite : @xmath53 the reddening in the optical regime is @xmath54 where the intrinsic color @xmath55 in equation  ( [ equ:6 ] ) , the absolute brightnesses @xmath56 and @xmath57 were computed from the theoretical relations given in @xcite : @xmath58 @xmath59 with the following conversion for metallicity : @xmath60 } - 1.765.\\ ] ] the zero points of the relations for @xmath56 and @xmath57 were calibrated to the data obtained for the well - studied representative globular cluster m3 ( ngc 5272 , @xcite ) , which hosts about 240 rr lyrae variables ( @xcite ) .",

    "finally , the distance @xmath67 to each rrab stars was calculated from the equation @xmath68      having distances to individual rr lyrae stars we can estimate the distance to the center of the entire old population , which we assume to coincide with the center of our galaxy . inside",

    "we fit a @xcite -like profile : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the maximum number of stars at the distance @xmath50 , and @xmath73 is the core radius .",
    "it is important to note that prior to the fitting we applied two geometric corrections to the data .",
    "first , the individual distances were projected onto the galactic plane ( by @xmath74 ) .",
    "second , we scaled the distribution by @xmath75 to correct for the so - called cone effect where more objects are seen at larger distances inside a solid angle .",

    "this gives an error of @xmath93  mag .",
    "the uncertainty of the metallicity relation ( equation  ( [ equ:9 ] ) ) of 0.18  dex ( @xcite ) propagates to a small additional error of 0.014  mag in the @xmath94 color of rr lyrae stars .",

    "finally , we have @xmath98  kpc .",
    "as expected , the uncertainty of @xmath50 is dominated by systematic error , whereas the large number of variables significantly lowers the statistical one .      to find the shape of the old bulge we use stars from the same rectangular area .",

    "after initial cleaning of the sample from likely globular cluster members and foreground and background objects ( mainly from the sgr dsph galaxy ) , we investigated the surface density distribution of the bulge rrab stars on the sky .",
    "we demonstrated that constant density lines are ellipses flattened along the galactic equator with a flattening of @xmath127 .",

    "we also confirmed a very weak metallicity gradient with galactocentric distance recently noted in based on the ogle - iii data .",
    "the analysis of the present sample gives a value of @xmath158  dex  kpc@xmath143 and indicates that the shape of the distribution does not change with the distance from the center .    in this work , for the first time , we pay attention to two very close sequences formed by rrab stars in the period  amplitude diagram .",
    "we interpret them as the presence of two major old bulge populations , a and b , which differ in their iron content .",
    "the mean observed shift between the two populations is 0.0095(7 ) in @xmath159 , while an estimated difference in metallicity is about 0.17  dex or lower .",
    "we found that population a is about four times less abundant than the slightly more metal - poor population b. by counting stars we have assessed that population a contains about 12% of the bulge rr lyr stars , populations b about 48% , and other old bulge populations the remaining 40% .",
    "the existence of multiple old populations suggests that the early formation of the milky way bulge happened via mergers ( ) .    the large sample of rr lyrae stars detected in the optical regime by the ogle survey has allowed us to study the 3d structure of the old bulge as close as @xmath1600.3  kpc from the gc .",
    "soon the ongoing near - ir vvv survey should complete this picture for the most central regions .",
    "however , there will still be many questions to answer , in particular , on the assembly history and dynamics of the old bulge and its relation to the galactic halo .",
    "spectroscopic follow - up observations conducted by surveys such as apogee ( @xcite ) and argos ( @xcite ) may help us to find answers to these key issues .",
