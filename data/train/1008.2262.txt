    "the main characteristics of the formation process and evolutionary sequence of low - mass young stellar objects ( yso ) is relatively well understood , with their formation via accretion disks ( precursors of planetary systems ) and the simultaneous ejection of collimated winds through the poles of the disk .",
    "the subsequent interaction of the winds with the ambient medium gives rise to other observed phenomena , such as molecular outflows and herbig - haro ( hh ) systems @xcite . in the case of massive stars ( m @xmath6 8  m@xmath7 ) ,",
    "the progress in the understanding of their formation and influence on the environment medium has been more difficult @xcite .",
    "it might be possible that high - mass stars form in a similar way than low - mass stars , namely through accretion onto the protostar until a massive object is assembled . however , there are significant differences between low- and high - mass star formation , among them : i ) massive stars are on the main sequence almost from their birth , with radiation pressure acting on dust grains that can become large enough to reverse the infall of matter ( in the case of low - mass stars , radiation pressure does not play any significant role in the halting of the accretion process ) , and ii ) they form in clusters and associations , within warmer , larger and more massive molecular clouds , with strong and complex influences on the surrounding molecular material via ionising radiation , outflows , and gravitational interactions .",
    "these differences have led to the suggestion that different mechanisms ( or modes ) may apply to low- and high - mass star formation ; for example , through an accretion disk in a similar way to the low - mass case , but with very high accretion rates ( yorke & sonnhalter 2002 ; mckee & tan 2003 ; krumholz et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ) , through a competitive accretion in a protocluster environment ( bonnell & bate 2006 ) , or through coalescence of previously formed stars of lower mass @xcite .",
    "one observational approach in the study of high - mass star formation has been to search for disks and jets in young high - mass stars , trying to find a parallelism with the formation of low - mass stars ( see , e.g. , the disk - outflow systems associated with the massive stars in w51n and w33a at scales of @xmath3 20003000  au ; zapata et al . 2009 ; davies et al .",

    "however , only a handful of sources have been studied in detail due to several strong observational limitations .",
    "these limitations arise from the fact that there is a relatively small number of young high - mass stars ( they are a very small fraction of the new stars and besides evolve quickly ) , they are highly obscured ( they are frequently only observable at cm and [ sub]mm wavelengths ) , and they are remote , which makes very difficult to identify and isolate single young high - mass stars owing to the lack of sufficient angular resolution . for example , an angular resolution of 1@xmath1 implies a linear scale of 2000 au for sources at distances of 2 kpc ( a typical distance for high - mass star formation regions ) , which are scales where multiple high - mass objects are expected to be found ( extrapolating from what is observed in orion , the closest region of massive star formation ; e.g. , zinnecker & yorke 2007 ) .    at a distance of 725",

    "2009 ) , cepheus - a is the second nearest high - mass star formation region after orion ( see kun , kiss , & balog 2008 for a review of the main observational characteristics of this region ) . because of its relative proximity , it has been possible to identify and isolate at the centre of this region the young massive star cepheus a hw2 , the brightest of the radio continuum sources observed in the region @xcite . with a mass of @xmath3 15 - 20  m@xmath7",
    ", hw2 is deeply embedded in a high - density core with visual extinction a@xmath8 @xmath9 10@xmath10 mag ( torrelles et al .",
    "1985 , 1993 ) .",
    "in fact , pravdo et al . ( 2009 ) and schneider , gnter , & schmitt ( 2009 ) have recently found that while some of the other radio continuum sources near hw2 are detected in x - rays with chandra , hw2 itself is not detected at these frequencies , deriving very high absorbing column densities towards this massive object ( although see parkin et al .",
    "2009 showing that massive ysos are hard to detect in x - rays even with moderate column densities ) .",
    "hw2 appears also hidden at 24.5  @xmath11 m @xcite .",
    "the nature of hw2 as a young massive star is also inferred from its association with very bright masers and intense magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "however , what makes this source a singular young massive star is its association with an ionised biconical highly collimated jet at scales @xmath12 1000  au ( outflow opening angle @xmath3 18@xmath5 ) , exhibiting ejections in opposite directions moving away from the central source at @xmath3 500  km  s@xmath4 , with an orientation similar to that of the more extended ( @xmath3 1@xmath13 ) bipolar molecular outflow seen in hco@xmath14 @xcite .",
    "these observational characteristics , in analogy to what is observed in low - mass ysos , supports the hypothesis that the massive young star hw2 has been formed through an accretion disk , rather than by merging of lower mass stars , because in this last case a collimated jet is not expected to survive .",
    "the detection of a rotating disk of dust and molecular gas with a size of @xmath3 700  au oriented perpendicular to , and spatially coincident with , the hw2 radio jet , together with the magnetic field predominantly aligned along the outflow and perpendicular to the disk , gives further support to the accretion disk scenario for the formation of this massive star @xcite .",
    "the presence of a disk  yso  jet system associated with cepheus a hw2 ( the smallest one ever detected around a young massive star ) , which is part of a cluster of massive stars observed in the region @xcite , has turned this object into an ideal laboratory for testing current theories of high - mass star formation , as well as to study their influence on the surrounding high - density molecular material via radiation ( e.g. , ionisation , dust and molecular gas heating ; garay et al . 1996 ; jimnez - serra et al .",

    "the high brightness and the compact nature of masers have proven to be extremely useful to study with angular resolution better than 1 mas the main properties of the gas very close to the ysos .",
    "the main goal of the observations presented here was to follow the evolution of the remarkable water maser linear / arcuate structures found in earlier vlbi observations @xcite .",
    "these previous observations led to the identification of at least three different centres of star formation activity in a region of @xmath3 0.3@xmath1 ( 200  au ) radius ; the first one associated with hw2 , a second one associated with the exciting source of the expanding water maser bubble r5 , and the third one associated with the exciting source of the maser arcuate structure r4 .",

    "after correlation at the nrao array operation center ( aoc ) , the data were calibrated and imaged using the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) . delay and phase calibration was provided by 3c345 , 1739 + 522 , 2007 + 777 , bl lac , and 3c454.3 , while bandpass corrections were made using 3c345 , bl lac , and 3c454.3 .",
    "the synthesised beam size was @xmath3 0.4  mas for the five epochs .",
    "we identified a strong ( @xmath21 10  jy ) point - like water maser at @xmath19 = @xmath206  km  s@xmath4 persisting in all the observed epochs , allowing us to self - calibrate the data using that same reference feature .",
    "the absolute co - ordinates obtained for the reference feature in the five epochs were in agreement to within @xmath3 0.01@xmath1 . a first co - ordinate alignment of the five epochs of observations was made with respect to this reference feature .",
    "in order to identify the regions of water maser emission , we first made large data cubes of 512 channel images of 8192@xmath228192 pixels with a cell - size of 1 mas for each of the five epochs , centred on the reference feature that was used for self - calibration .",
    "water maser emission was found essentially around hw2 and hw3d , spread over a spatio - kinematical region of @xmath3 4@xmath1 and @xmath3 200 velocity channels ( @xmath19 @xmath9 @xmath2030 to + 10  km  s@xmath4 ) .",
    "after that , we simultaneously mapped , for each epoch , 7 fields of 4096@xmath224096 pixels @xmath22 [ 200 velocity channels ] with a cell - size of 0.1 mas to image , with the full angular resolution , the space - velocity regions identified with lower angular resolution in the previous step . in this way , about 1800 maser spots for each epoch were identified , most of them unresolved , obtaining their positions by fitting a two - dimensional gaussian profile ( we define a maser spot as emission occurring at a given velocity channel and distinct spatial position ) .",
    "the rms noise level of the individual channel maps ranges from @xmath3 5 to 400 mjy  beam@xmath4 , depending on the intensity of the maser components present in each velocity channel . for the identification of the maser spots",
    "a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio @xmath0 8 was adopted as the detection threshold . from this s / n ratio and the beam size of 0.4 mas",
    ", we estimate that the accuracy in the relative positions of the spots within each epoch is better than 0.03 mas .    in general ,",
    "vlba proper motion measurements of water masers are limited by the high time variability of their flux density .",
    "the standard method is to phase reference to a particular strong maser spot , as the one used here for self - calibration ( see above ) .",
    "however , the selected reference spot may have its own proper motion , which therefore results in arbitrary offsets in the proper motions for the whole system .",
    "for the measurement of proper motions of water masers presented in this paper (  3 ) , we defined a more  stationary \" reference frame , by identifying nine strong masers ( @xmath0 1 jy ) with different lsr velocities , spread over the full region of @xmath3 4@xmath1 size where maser emission is detected , and persisting in the five observed epochs .",
    "the new reference position is defined as the mean position of these nine strong masers .",
    "we calculated this mean position for each epoch , and assuming that it is stationary , we realigned all epochs with respect to it .",
    "after that , all the offset positions presented in this paper are with respect to the nominal position of hw2 ( @xmath23(j2000.0 ) = @xmath24 , @xmath25(j2000.0 ) = 62@xmath501@xmath1349.57@xmath1 ; c2006 ) . in the following section we present the main results obtained toward hw2 and hw3d .",
    "all the proper motion values given in this paper have been determined considering the first four epochs , which are grouped in a short time - span of two months , thus minimising variability effects .",
    "the fifth epoch , separated from the fourth one by four and a half months , has been used to confirm trends in the derived proper motions , but not in their explicit calculation .",
    "in figure 1 we show the positions and radial velocities ( lsr ) of the water maser spots detected with the vlba in the five observed epochs ( hereafter vlba 2001 - 2002 data set ) . in this figure",
    "we also show the 1.3 cm continuum and water maser sources observed previously with the vla ( hereafter vla 1995 data set ; t98 ) , as well as the water masers observed in 1996 with the vlba ( hereafter vlba 1996 data set ; t2001a , b ) . the alignment of the different data sets ( vla 1995 , vlba 1996 , and vlba 2001 - 2002 ) has been made by their absolute co - ordinates . the accuracy of this simple alignment is better than 0.05@xmath1 , which is good enough for a general comparison between the different data sets at the scale shown in figure 1 . in this figure",

    "the association of intense water masers with hw3d further supports that this source harbours an internal young massive star ( early b star ) as suggested by @xcite , although perhaps less evolved than hw2 because of the compactness of both the 1.3 cm continuum emission and the cluster of masers .    with regard to the masers around hw2 ,",

    "given the patchy ring structure , with the masers to the northwest showing a more regular distribution than the ones to the southeast ( fig .",
    "4 ) , an alternative explanation for the r4 structure could be that this is an expanding reverse shock where an external wind ( from hw2 ) is interacting with a small dense clump located at the centre of the structure ( reverse shocks have been predicted by parkin et al .",
    "2009 within wind - cavity interactions in massive ysos ) .",
    "however , although we can not discard this possibility , the fact that the masers in r4 show the highest lsr radial velocity dispersion of all the maser structures in the region , well differentiated from the others , and with very high flux densities , led us to favour that they have been excited by a close massive yso other than hw2 through some kind of violent ejection event .    according to the current literature",

    "1980 ; mundt & fried 1983 ) , one of the main issues that immediately arose was to know their driving and collimating mechanism , as well as to ascertain the relationship between molecular outflows and jets .",
    "multiple observations toward low - mass protostars show than when highly collimated high - velocity jets are detected ( usually in visible or radio continuum wavelengths ) , they are enclosed within relatively low - velocity outflows with a wide opening angle ( usually observed in molecular line transitions ) . some clear examples of the simultaneous presence of a jet and a wide - angle outflow in low - mass ysos can be found in l1551 ( itoh et al .",

    "various theoretical models have been developed to explain these outflows and their relationship in low - mass ysos , archetypical among them are the `` x - wind '' and the `` disk - wind '' models . in the x - wind model , the primary wind is driven magnetocentrifugally from the interface between the magnetosphere of the yso and the associated circumstellar disk .",
    "the primary wind has an angle - dependent density distribution , with a dense axial jet surrounded by a more tenuous wide - angle wind .",
    "the morphology of both the observed highly collimated jets and the wide - angle molecular outflows are explained through the interaction of the primary wind with the ambient gas ( e.g. , shu et al .",
    "1994 ; shang et al . 2006 ) . on the other hand , in the disk - wind model",
    "the highly collimated wind is driven magnetocentrifugally from a wide range of circumstellar disk radii , surrounded by a wide - angle wind driven by toroidal magnetic pressure during the evolution of a rotating collapsing magnetised molecular core ( e.g. , banerjee & pudritz 2006 ) .",
    "recently , machida et al .",
    "( 2008 ) follow , through mhd simulations , the evolution of a collapsing cloud , until protostar formation takes place .",
    "these authors find two distinct flows with different degrees of collimation and velocities : a low - velocity wide - angle outflow , magnetocentrifugally driven from the circumstellar disk , and guided by hourglass - like field lines , and a fast highly - collimated outflow driven by magnetic pressure and guided by straight field lines near the protostar .",
    "the main difference in terms of observational predictions between the machida et al .",

    "the vlba multi - epoch water maser observations towards the hw2-disk system show now , for the first time in a high - mass yso , and similar to what is observed in low - mass ysos , the simultaneous presence of a high velocity jet surrounded by a wide - angle outflow in the hw2-disk system at scales @xmath2 600  au .",

    "these masers are located ( in projection ) near the north - east edge of the hw2 dust disk , as observed with the sma by patel et al .",

    "in fact , while r6 and r8 ( which are located at both sides of r7 ; figures 1 and 2 ) exhibit motions in the sky almost in opposite directions ( r6 toward the south - east with pa @xmath9 118@xmath5 , and r8 toward the north - west with pa @xmath9 35@xmath5 ) , r7 shows faster motions toward the north - east ( pa @xmath9 74@xmath5 ) , along a direction closer to the jet axis , with a difference in position angle of @xmath3 30@xmath5 with respect to the highly collimated hw2 radio jet ( pa @xmath9 45@xmath5 ) ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "all these properties can be explained in a shock interaction scenario within the disk - hw2-outflow system . in this scenario ,",
    "outlined in figure 5 , we propose that r6 and r8 represent emission fronts from the walls of expanding cavities of the circumstellar gas around hw2 , created and shocked by a wide - angle primary wind from this source ( outflow opening angle @xmath3 102@xmath5 ) .",
    "we also propose that the linear structure r6 ( v@xmath26 @xmath9 11 to 18  km  s@xmath4 , blue - shifted with respect to the ambient cloud ;  3.1 ) is the counterpart of the r1-r3 linear structure ( v@xmath26 @xmath9 10 to + 1  km  s@xmath4 , red - shifted ; t2001b ) located in the opposite side ( to the west of hw2 ; figure 1 ) .",
    "this structure was interpreted previously as produced in the shocked walls of an expanding cavity ( t2001b ) .",
    "in fact , although both linear structures ( r6 and r1 - 3 ) have similar orientations , their proper motions are almost in opposite directions ( r6 : @xmath11 @xmath9 13  km  s@xmath4 at pa @xmath9 118@xmath5 ; r1 : @xmath11 @xmath9 5 km  s@xmath4 at pa @xmath9 55@xmath5 ) .",

    "on the other hand , the higher motions of the r7 masers along a direction closer to the main axis of the hw2 radio jet suggest that the interaction of the wide - angle primary wind from hw2 with the molecular gas is within the cavities , through a less slowed - down ambient medium .",
    "as seen in  3.1 and figure 6 , the expanding motions of the masers form a fan - like structure at very small scales ( @xmath3 4 mas , @xmath3 3 au ) . by means of a linear fitting of the average positions of each of the linear structures observed in the different epochs of r7",
    ", we find that the line joining these average positions ( hereafter central line ; fig .",
    "6 ) is pointing back toward the hw2 position within @xmath3 20 mas .",
    "a linear fitting of the positions of each of the two edges of the r7 structures at different epochs gives two lines that intersect at ( @xmath29@xmath23,@xmath29@xmath25 ) @xmath9 ( 509.1 mas,163.2 mas ) , almost exactly ( within @xmath3 0.3 mas ! ) on the central line , but much closer to the position of the detected maser emission than to that of hw2 . from these values we estimate a dynamical time - scale of @xmath3 0.3 yr for the expanding structure",
    "these results suggest that the r7 masers , which are moving along a direction with a difference angle of @xmath3 30@xmath5 with respect to the main axis of the radio jet , are excited by the hw2 wide - angle primary wind via interaction with small clumps of gas within the cavity , accelerated and beginning to expand in a short - lived event .",

    "in addition , the lsr radial velocity gradient of @xmath3 2 km s@xmath4 observed along the linear structure of r7 , with more red - shifted velocities towards the north - western part ( figures 2 and 6 ) , could trace a rotating outflow from hw2 , extracting angular momentum from the disk .",
    "in fact , a lsr radial velocity gradient of @xmath3 5  km  s@xmath4 is observed along the major axis of the rotating disk of hw2 , with more red - shifted velocities also toward the north - west ( patel et al .",

    "2007 , 2009 ) .",
    "this lsr radial velocity gradient was also observed in the h@xmath30o masers of the vla 1995 data set ( t96 ) , with more red - shifted velocities toward the north - west , although it is less evident in the vlba 1996 and vlba 2001 - 2002 data sets ( fig .",
    "7 ) . however , with the present data we can not distinguish whether the observed velocity gradient in the linear structures of r7 is due to a rotating outflow or due to intrinsic velocity shifts in the surrounding ambient molecular gas , before the interaction with the hw2 primary wind . to differentiate clearly between these two possibilities",
    "it would be necessary to detect another fan - like water maser structure in the opposite side , to the south - west of hw2 , with similar velocity gradients .",
    "we also note that even if the velocity gradient observed in the masers of r7 has a rotation origin , it seems that now the structure is not conserving angular momentum , because even when it expands significantly between the four epochs , the total velocity difference for any given epoch remains approximately constant ( see fig .",
    "if we had a structure with angular momentum conservation this total velocity difference would have to diminish with expansion .",
    "most likely , the features constituting r7 are at present moving ballistically .",
    "the scenario proposed to explain the r6 , r7 , r8 , and r1 - 3 structures in hw2 is similar to what was proposed by moscadelli , cesaroni , & rioja ( 2005 ) to explain the conical outflow in the high - mass object iras 20126 + 4104 ( also observed through vlbi multi - epoch water maser observations ) .",
    "the main difference is that while in iras 20126 + 4104 the masers were observed to be tracing an outflow with an opening angle of @xmath3 34@xmath5 , in hw2 the masers trace a wider outflow ( opening angle of @xmath3 102@xmath5 ) with expanding cavities surrounding the radio continuum jet ( opening angle of @xmath3 18@xmath5 ) .",
    "we also considered the possibility that the r6 , r8 , and r1 - 3 masing regions could be associated with the far wings of a bow shock driven by a collimated jet ( i.e. , the jet observed in radio continuum ) with successive working surfaces produced by an outflow variability , in the absence of a wide - angle wind , as proposed for the low mass protostar xz tau ( krist et al . 2008 ) .",
    "a working surface is formed in a supersonic flow ( in this case , the jet ) as a result of a supersonic increase in its ejection velocity .",
    "high velocity material catches up with the previously ejected , lower velocity flow , forming two shocks : a leading one which accelerates the lower velocity flow and a reverse shock which decelerates the higher velocity material ejected at later times ( for details see raga et al .",
    "material is constantly being accumulated between the two shocks , and part of it is ejected sideways , transferring its linear momentum to the surrounding medium ( by means of a bow shock driven into this medium ) . however , although we can not rule out this possibility ( detailed modelling of the proper motions are required ) , the motions of the r7 structure along an axis at an angle of @xmath3 30@xmath5 with respect to the radio jet axis would imply the presence of a wider outflow than that indicated by the jet .",
    "wide - angle outflows have been observed in ysos of all luminosities , from @xmath3 1 to 10@xmath31 l@xmath7 ( e.g. , shepherd 2005 ; qiu et al .",
    "2009 ; matthews et al . 2010 ) .",
    "what makes our vlba water maser results in cepheus a hw2 highly significant is the fact that both , highly collimated and wide - angle outflows , are observed simultaneously , and at similar physical scales .",
    "although at the moment , there are no models predicting the simultaneous presence of these two kinds of outflows in young high - mass stars , as those developed for low - mass ysos , we think that our observational results represent an important constraint for future models on high - mass stars when trying to reproduce the scale where these outflows are observed .",
    "future ( sub)mm high - angular observations would also be very valuable to look for the presence of molecular ( e.g. , co , sio ) conical shells associated with hw2 to have an even stronger comparison to what is observed in low - mass objects .",
    "we have carried out vlba multi - epoch ( 2001 - 2002 epochs ) water maser observations toward the high - mass protostar cepheus a hw2 with 0.4 mas ( 0.3 au ) resolution .",
    "these observations show that the previously reported r5 and r4 arcuate structures ( 1996 epochs ; t2001b ) have suffered large morphological changes at scales of @xmath2 0.1@xmath1 ( 70 au ) in a time span of five years .",
    "in particular , the r5 expanding bubble structure observed five years before , located @xmath3 0.6@xmath1 ( 400 au ) south of hw2 , is currently dissipating in the circumstellar medium , losing its previous degree of symmetry , thus corroborating the very short - lived nature of this phenomenon .",
    "on the other hand , the masers of the r4 structure trace a nearly elliptical patchy expanding ring of @xmath3 70 mas size ( 50 au ) , supporting the ring scenario proposed previously by gallimore et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , rather than the bow - shock scenario proposed by t2001b .",
    "we propose that the central yso driving the observed expanding motions of the ring is a still unidentified source ( probably a massive object given the high luminosity of the associated water masers ) that should be located @xmath3 0.2@xmath1 ( 145 au ) south of hw2 .",
    "our water maser observations also reveal a relatively slow wide - angle outflow ( opening angle @xmath3 102@xmath5 ) with the simultaneous presence of the high - velocity ionised jet ( opening angle @xmath3 18@xmath5 ) associated with hw2 .",
    "the presence of high - velocity jets , enclosed within wide - angle outflows , has been observed in low - mass protostars .",
    "the importance of our result is that this is now observed in a massive protostar , with the highly collimated and wide - angle outflow in hw2 occurring simultaneously at a similar physical scale of @xmath3 1@xmath1 ( 700 au ) .",
    "our results provide important constraints for future models of high - mass stars that try to reproduce the different outflow opening angles observed in the cepheus a hw2 system .",
    "the high brightness of the masers has proven to be extremely useful to study the gas very close to young massive stars through vlbi multi - epoch observations .",
    "these observations , in addition , are revealing very short - lived events .",

    "<S> we present five epochs of vlbi water maser observations around the massive protostar cepheus a hw2 with 0.4 mas ( 0.3 au ) resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the main goal of these observations was to follow the evolution of the remarkable water maser linear / arcuate structures found in earlier vlbi observations . comparing the data of our new epochs of observation with those observed five years before </S>",
    "<S> , we find that at `` large '' scales of @xmath01@xmath1 ( 700 au ) the main regions of maser emission persist , implying that both the surrounding medium and the exciting sources of the masers have been relatively stable during that time span . </S>",
    "<S> however , at smaller scales of @xmath2 0.1@xmath1 ( 70 au ) we see large changes in the maser structures , particularly in the expanding arcuate structures r4 and r5 . </S>",
    "<S> r4 traces a nearly elliptical patchy ring of @xmath3 70 mas size ( 50 au ) with expanding motions of @xmath3 5  mas  yr@xmath4 ( 15  km  s@xmath4 ) , consistent with previous results of gallimore and collaborators . </S>",
    "<S> this structure is probably driven by the wind of a still unidentified yso located at the centre of the ring ( @xmath3 0.18@xmath1 south of hw2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the r5 expanding bubble structure ( driven by the wind of a previously identified yso located @xmath3 0.6@xmath1 south of hw2 ) is currently dissipating in the circumstellar medium and losing its previous degree of symmetry , indicating a very short - lived event . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our results reveal , at scales of @xmath3 1@xmath1 ( 700 au ) , the simultaneous presence of a relatively slow ( @xmath3 10 - 70 km  s@xmath4 ) wide - angle outflow ( opening angle of @xmath3 102@xmath5 ) , traced by the masers , and the fast ( @xmath3 500  km  s@xmath4 ) highly collimated radio jet associated with hw2 ( opening angle of @xmath3 18@xmath5 ) , previously observed with the vla . </S>",
    "<S> this simultaneous presence of a wide - angle outflow and a highly collimated jet associated with a massive protostar is similar to what is found in some low - mass ysos . </S>",
    "<S> there are indications that the primary wind(s ) from hw2 could be rotating . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of these results in the study of the formation of high - mass stars are discussed .    </S>",
