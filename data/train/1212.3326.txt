    "as early as the 1890s , the periodic structures ( crystals ) in three dimensions were determined by 230 space groups based on periodicity , and then the classical crystallography was completed , in which the allowed rotational symmetry is only 1- , 2- , 3- , 4- , 6-fold symmetry . both the structure determination and the study of physical properties",
    "are based on the periodicity which allows the study to be simplified to a unit cell .",
    "however , in the 1980s , a forbidden 5-fold symmetry electron diffraction pattern was discovered by shechtman et al.@xcite in a rapid cooled al - mn alloy .",
    "later , the term `` quasicrystals '' appeared for the first time to describe the non - conventional ordered structures@xcite . in an idealized description ,",
    "quasicrystals have quasiperiodic , rather than periodic , translational order with non - crystallographic symmetry . in the early theory of tilings",
    ", the discovery of aperiodic tiling with 5-fold symmetry of the plane by penrose@xcite showed that such well - ordered systems were mathematically possible . since the original discovery , hundreds of quasicrystals have been reported and confirmed in metallic alloys with 5- , 8- , 10- , 12- fold orientational symmetry@xcite .",
    "two decades after the first discovery of quasicrystals in metallic alloys , several soft quasicrystals have been found in soft matter systems@xcite .",
    "the building blocks of the solid - state quasicrystals are the atoms or small molecular on the atomic scale , whilst the building blocks of soft quasicrystals are on a much larger scale of ten to hundreds of nanometers .",
    "therefore the continuous density distribution are more appropriate for studying soft quasicrystals .",
    "accordingly the coarse - grained free energy of density functions have been widely applied to treat phases and phase transitions , especially for soft matter systems@xcite .",
    "quasicrystals are one kind of space - filling structures",
    ". two kinds of theoretical approaches have been developed to study quasicrystals , or more generally , aperiodic crystals .",
    "the first method is an approximate approach which studies crystalline approximants rather than quasicrystals .",
    "the crystalline approximants are periodic structures in which the arrangements of lattices closely approximate the local structures in quasicrystals .",
    "many crystalline approximants related to quasicrystals have also been discovered@xcite .",
    "these approximants may play an important role in describing the local structures of quasicrystals , their formation , stability , and physical properties .",
    "the second approach is a direct method to study the quasicrystals or aperiodic crystals in the hyperspace , called the higher - dimensional approach . from this approach",
    ", a quasiperiodic structure may be viewed as a periodic structure by extending it into a higher - dimensional space .",
    "its symmetries can be expressed in terms of the conventional point groups and space groups of higher - dimensional periodic crystals@xcite . in the higher - dimensional description ,",
    "quasiperiodic structures result from irrational physical - space cuts of appropriate periodic hypercrystal structures .",
    "it is so - called cut - and - project method .",
    "the higher - dimensional approach reveals the hidden structural correlations . to implement the higher - dimensional approach in the direct space",
    "one must know the discrete lattice arrangements of higher - dimensional periodic structure .",
    "the embedded spaces of @xmath0-dimensional quasiperiodic structures are abstract spaces whose dimensions are more than three .",
    "the dimensions of the embedded space are dependent on the symmetry of the quasicrystal ( @xmath1)@xcite . for example , the quasicrystals with 5- , 8- , 10- , and 12-fold symmetry need to be embedded into four - dimensional space . while for the quasiperiodic structures with 7- , 9- , 18-fold symmetry , the dimension of the embedding spaces increases to six .",
    "for other symmetries , embedding spaces with even higher dimension will be needed .",
    "therefore it makes the method difficult for implementing .",
    "another disadvantage of applying the higher - dimensional approach in direct space is that in practical problems one is required to compute the continuous quasiperiodic distribution rather than the discrete quasiperiodic lattice .",
    "a convenient way to describe the quasiperiodic structures is in the higher - dimensional reciprocal space@xcite . by redefining point - group symmetry and space - group symmetry in terms of gauge functions",
    ", a broader fourier - space crystallography@xcite has also been developed to describe quasiperiodic structures .",
    "the traditional idea for treating quasicrystals is using a periodic structure to approximate the quasiperiodic structure .",
    "the method has been applied to molecular dynamics simulations@xcite , monte carlo simulations@xcite , numerical discretization methods@xcite . in other words ,",
    "those methods compute crystalline approximants rather than quasicrystals .",
    "a natural expectation is that the obtained approximants should approximate quasicrystals as the computational box goes to infinity .",
    "the advantage of the approximate method is that using the periodic boundary conditions is convenient .",
    "however , the approach can not obtain quasicrystals exactly unless the computational box is the full space because of the restriction of the simultaneous diophantine approximation ( sda)@xcite .",
    "we will further explain this point in sec.[sec : numericlmethods ] .",
    "in this paper , we focus on the development of numerical methods for generating quasicrystals to high precision , rather than crystalline approximants .",
    "the proposed approach is based on the observation that the fourier spectrum of a @xmath0-dimensional quasicrystal , consists of @xmath2 peaks on a @xmath3-module , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , of rank @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) with basis vectors @xmath8@xcite .",
    "therefore , an natural idea is directly computing the fourier spectrum of quasicrystals instead of using periodic cells to compute crystalline approximants in real space .",
    "although our proposed method is applicable to any model including quasicrystals . for illustrative purpose",
    "we utilize the lifshitz - petrich model@xcite to demonstrate our algorithm . before we go further",

    "the most significant feature of the lifshitz - petrich model is the existence of two characteristic length scales , @xmath18 and @xmath12 , which is a necessary condition to stabilize the quasicrystals@xcite .",
    "therefore it is a suitable model to demonstrate our proposed approach .",
    "theoretically , the ordered patterns , including periodic and quasiperiodic , are corresponding to local minima of the free energy functional of the system with respect to order parameter @xmath19 . accordingly",
    "the order parameter @xmath20 is the minimum of the free energy density functional , which means @xmath21 in order to find the equilibrium state , we introduce a relaxational dynamical to minimize the lifshitz - petrich energy functional which yields @xmath22 we choose a semi - implicit scheme to solve the dynamical equation([eqn : ac ] ) : @xmath23 @xmath24 is the time step size .",
    "the specific implementation of the semi - implicit method for different numerical methods will be discussed in sec.[sec : numericlmethods ] .",
    "the current paper is devoted to develop a numerical method to calculate quasicrystals rather than crystalline approximants .",
    "numerical methods designed for periodic structures have been used to study quasicrystals approximately@xcite . here",
    "we call this method the `` crystalline approximant method ( cam ) '' . in order to describe this method ,",
    "a brief introduction of numerical methods for treating periodic structures is necessary , more details can be found in . for any @xmath0-dimensional periodic function @xmath25 , @xmath26 , the repeated structural unit",
    "is called a unit cell .",

    "one of the most important properties of the reciprocal lattices is that plane waves @xmath40 form a set of basis functions for any function with periodicity of the lattice .",
    "the periodic function @xmath25 on the bravais lattice can be expanded as @xmath41 for periodic structures , the reciprocal lattice vectors have two important features : @xmath42 , @xmath43 , ",
    ", @xmath44 are linearly independent ; and @xmath39 , @xmath45 . in the direct space ,",
    "the lattice vectors have the same properties .",
    "the main idea of cam is to use periodic structures to approximate quasicrystals . for a @xmath0-dimensional quasicrystals , its reciprocal lattice vectors @xmath46",
