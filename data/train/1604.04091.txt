    "the fact that ( ii ) implies pure @xmath0-unrectifiability follows from lemma 2.7 in badger and schul s paper @xcite , which states that @xmath0-rectifiable measures have positive lower @xmath0-density almost everywhere .",

    "( ii ) , we make a few useful remarks about the structure of @xmath1 and its support .",
    "first , the support of each measure @xmath146 is contained in a finite union of closures of dyadic squares of side - length @xmath162 , namely @xmath183^{2 } : i \\in i_{n } , t \\in d_{n}\\},\\ ] ] see figure [ fig2 ] . the same is true for the measure @xmath1 , and",
    "in fact we even have the improved conclusion that the support of @xmath1 is contained in the union of the proper dyadic squares @xmath184 this improvement is due to the fact that the squares in @xmath185 contained in a square @xmath186 always stay at positive distance from the two `` open sides '' of the dyadic square @xmath42 .    the following observation is an immediate corollary of the previous discussion , and the fact that for a fixed segment @xmath141 , the squares @xmath187^{2}$ ] lie in a single row `` on top '' of @xmath141 :    [ auxlemma1 ] if @xmath138 and @xmath141 , @xmath156 , are the segments appearing in the definition of @xmath132 , then @xmath188 is contained in the union of rectangles of the form @xmath189 } [ j^{n}_{i } + ( 0,h)],\\ ] ] and @xmath190 .",
    "since the side - lengths @xmath162 are , by , far smaller than both the `` spacing '' @xmath152 and the distance @xmath154 , the following holds for all squares @xmath191 : @xmath192 this gives the following observation :    [ squareseq ] for every point @xmath27 there exists a unique sequence of dyadic squares @xmath193 with @xmath194 the square @xmath195 in this sequence will be denoted by @xmath196 .",
    "observe that to every square @xmath186 , @xmath197 , one may canonically associate a sequence @xmath198 and a measure @xmath199 .",

    ", we prove another lemma :    [ auxlemma2 ] suppose @xmath138 , and @xmath42 is a dyadic square containing a point @xmath27 .",

    "a possible position of the square @xmath42 is depicted in the left half of figure [ fig2 ] .",

    "further , @xmath224 .",
    "the main assumption @xmath225 means that the side - length of @xmath42 is less than half of the minimal ( vertical ) gap between the segments @xmath221 and @xmath226  indeed this minimal gap is the one between @xmath227 \\times \\{r_{1,n_{1}}\\}$ ] and @xmath228 \\times \\{0\\}$ ] . since @xmath42 is a dyadic square , and the numbers @xmath229 are all dyadic , this implies that @xmath42 is entirely contained in some slab of the form @xmath230 , where @xmath231 and @xmath232 are consecutive elements from @xmath233 .",
