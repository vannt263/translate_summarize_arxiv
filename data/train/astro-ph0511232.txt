    "ten years ago the first extra solar planet was discovered around 51  peg @xcite and today we know of more than 160 planets discovered with radial velocity ( rv ) measurements .",
    "previous rv planet search programs have concentrated on old and inactive stars .",
    "it is now generally believed that the orbits of planetary systems change in time .",
    "this is of crucial importance for the formation of planets and the evolution of extra solar planetary systems ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "therefore it is necessary to study the orbits of young extrasolar planets and compare them to old ones .",
    "we therefore monitor the rv of 40 young stars at the thringer landessternwarte ( tls ) and 80 young stars with harps at 3.6 m telescope at eso / la silla .",
    "young stars are active and one source for active stars within 100pc is the catalogue of flare stars published by @xcite . in this paper we discuss the g- and k - stars in this catalogue of the northern hemisphere .",
    "we present the results of the spectral synthesis analysis performed to derive the stellar parameters , to compare these to the results achieved by other groups , and to put the stars into a general picture , e.g. identify the stellar association the stars origin from .",
    "we present here the results of the rv measurement of five stars .",
    "the remaining three were too faint and too far south from the tls to measure a sufficient amount of rv data points .",
    "the publication is organised as follows : a short description of the analysing methods is followed by the results of this analysis for the individual stars , followed by an overview of the rv monitoring and the findings , followed by a discussion and conclusions .",
    "we observed the northern flare star sample 2000 - 2001 from calar alto using the high resolution chelle spectrograph foces @xcite mounted on the 2.2 m telescope .",
    "data reduction and analysis was carried out using the reduction pipeline written in idl especially for this fibre coupled spectrograph .    for the spectral synthesis analysis we used the model atmospheres mafags . for a detailed description of the methods",

    "@xcite has extended the program but has also given a detailed description of the state of the art of the model atmosphere code mafags .",
    "a number of eight stars of the northern gershberg sample were analysed in total .",
    "as described in @xcite we deduce the effective temperature from the balmer line wings , the surface gravity from the iron ionisation equilibrium and the wings of the mg  ib lines .",
    "the analysis is performed strictly relative to the sun .      in this paper",

    "the resulting iodine absorption spectrum is then superposed on top of the stellar spectrum providing a stable wavelength reference against which the stellar rv are measured . in the first step ,",
    "the spectra are bias - subtracted , flat - fielded , and extracted using standard iraf routines .    in the second step the rvs",
    "are calculated by modelling the observed spectra with a high signal - to - noise ratio template of the star ( without iodine ) and a scan of our iodine cell taken at very high resolution with the fourier transform spectrometer of the mcmath - pierce telescope at kitt peak .",
    "the latter enables us to compute the relative velocity shift between stellar and iodine absorption lines as well as to model the temporal and spatial variations of the instrumental profile .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a description of the principles behind this technique .",

    "[ fig : rv_hd37394 ] ) : the variance is only 11.8ms@xmath12 which should be compared to the average error of the measurement of 7.2ms@xmath12 .",
    "we explain this by the relatively slow rotation which is indicated by the long rotation period and @xmath2 . despite the low amplitude we find a possible period of about 14 days of the rv - variations .",
    "the subgiant hip  73555 is an interesting testcase for rv measurements , because as mentioned above there are interferometric radius measurements available . as mentioned above the radius",

    "[ fig : rv_hip73555 ] ) .",
    "the obvious explanation of this variation is simply the presence of stellar surface features in conjunction with the rotation of the star . under this assumption",
    ", we calculate an inclination of @xmath29    [ fig : rv_hip73555 ]       in the lick planet search @xcite hn  peg was observed with a precision of @xmath30ms@xmath12 , but no significant rv variations were detected . however , we find sinusoidal variations ( see fig .  [",

    "[ fig : period_hnpeg ] .",
    "this strange behaviour agrees well with the results of the photometric monitoring in the years 1992 - 1998 of @xcite .",
    "they detect a period of @xmath35days which was seen throughout their entire observing time and additional periods in the range between 4.4 and 4.8 days .",
    "they explain this with the activity cycle of the star in conjunction with differential rotation .",
    "@xcite monitored the flux - variations of ca  h & k of hn  peg for 12 years , and find periods in the range between 4.57 to 5.30 days .",
    "additionally @xcite measured periodic h@xmath8 and ca  h & k flux variations , and variations in the strmgen photometry with a period of 4.74days .",
    "thus , with the rv - measurements we find the same periods again , as in the photometric data , as well as in the line - flux variations of the h@xmath8 and ca  h & k.              we monitored the star in 2001 - 2003 and it showed periodic rv variation of @xmath36 days and a semi - amplitude of about 20ms@xmath12 ( fig .",

    "our spectral synthesis analysis confirms the mass of the primary . the light contribution of the secondary to the spectrum of the primary is negligible so that the analysis is not affected .",
    "we can exclude a planetary companion with a mass @xmath37 1.0 m@xmath38 with a period @xmath39 10days .",
    "* hip  73555 * is a young post - main - sequence giant and not a pre - main - sequence star",
    ". therefore it should not be listed in the @xcite catalogue .",
    "the conclusions for this star is : it is a young post - main - sequence star with only 240myrs but due to its mass it has already evolved past the main - sequence and thus does not belong to this sample .",
    "but since the star is relatively young it might anyway be interesting to search for planets in its vicinity . for this star ,",
    "we can exclude a planet with a mass of more than 0.6 m@xmath38 with a period of less than 200 days ( @xmath44 one au ) .",
    "the other stars are all zams stars .",
    "the flare activity is probably related to the differential rotation and the magnetic field of the star .",
    "though the spot coverage of * ek  dra * is about 1/3 of the visible surface at some phases of rotation and activity , these kind spots are not know on the surface of the sun .    on the other flare stars analysed on course of this work we realise that the h@xmath8 cores are often filled - in and that the temperature estimated from h@xmath8 is if the core is filled by more than 10% , 20 - 40k lower than the h@xmath45 temperature .",
    "in those cases we give priority to the h@xmath45 temperature . especially while analysing date from * ek  dra * @xcite we experience these changes dramatically",
    "we have also seen a temperature difference of 120k measured using only h@xmath8 at spectra with maximal filling - in and minimal filling - in of the line core .",
    "the h@xmath45-line is not that strongly filled - in so that the temperature difference is within the errorbars not measurable .    the lithium abundance of * hn  peg * and * ek  dra * exceeds the lithium abundance of other g - type stars , even for their young age .",
    "it is interesting to note that the two stars with the lithium overabundance are also the most active stars of our sample .",
    "it is will known that active , late type stars have an overabundance of lithium @xcite .",
    "we thus speculate that in this star lithium is generated during flare events @xcite . *",
    "hn  peg * and ek  dra do not show other peculiarities in its spectrum .",
    "they are otherwise typical zams stars .",
    "we can exclude a planetary companion with a mass @xmath37 0.4 m@xmath38 with a period @xmath39 10days around hn  peg .    * hip  114385 * and * hip  114376  a&b * the stars form a hierarchical triple system . the spectroscopic and ao binary hip  114376  a&b is the star appearing in the flare star catalogue .",
    "maybe the binarity triggers the activity .",
    "we can not analyse the binary but the analysis of the companion is possible and we can then assume a common formation scenario and thus the same age , and metallicity .    as a general remark we conclude that all these stars are zams stars making the older than previously suspected by having only the information about the flaring activity .",
    "due to their proximity to the sun they are all good targets for direct imaging searches for planets which are already ongoing .",
    "rv monitoring for the planet search are challenging as the example of ek  dra shows due to the flaring activity and stellar spots on the surface .",
    "the stars all have about solar metallicity .",
    "it is interesting to note the two most active stars of this sample have an overabundance of lithium .",
    "we deduce a mean @xmath46kms@xmath12 of our sample stars . in all monitored stars",
    "we detect periodic rv variations .",
    "the semi - amplitude is typically 20ms@xmath12 .",
    "this corresponds to the activity level seen in the rv amplitude of @xmath47  eri @xcite . around this star it was possible to detect a planet of @xmath48m@xmath38 which caused a semi - amplitude of 19ms@xmath12 , an eccentricity of @xmath49 , a semimajor axis of 3.4au and a period of @xmath50days",
