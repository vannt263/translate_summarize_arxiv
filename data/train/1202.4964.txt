    "to check these parameters using a different observational technique , we constructed a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) for tyc 4110 , using the near uv to 2mass @xcite and wise @xcite ir photometry compiled in table [ star ] ( see figure [ sed ] ) .",

    "we did however perform a monte carlo simulation of our spectroscopically determined stellar parameters and the @xcite relations , and found a stellar mass and radius consistent with the aforementioned values .",
    "we assess the evolutionary state of tyc 4110 by comparing its spectroscopically measured fundamental stellar parameters against a yonsei - yale stellar evolutionary track @xcite for a m@xmath60 = 1.07 m@xmath3 star having @xmath50 $ ] = -0.01 .",
    "this is done in figure [ hrd ] , where the shaded region depicts deviations in the evolutionary track which would be expected from a 1-@xmath17 ( 0.08 m@xmath3 ) change in the assumed stellar mass , while circles denote different time stamps in the track .",
    "tyc 4110 lies near a predicted age of @xmath15 gyr in figure [ hrd ] ; we therefore conclude that it is a main sequence dwarf star .",
    "the lack of any detectable ca ii h and k emission in our arces spectra ( log(r@xmath64 ) @xmath4 -5.1 ) indicates the star is relatively inactive , and thus qualitatively consistent with the evolutionary state we derive .",
    "we computed the absolute radial velocity of tyc 4110 by cross - correlating the six epochs of sarg spectra against a solar spectrum .",
    "after removing the radial velocity contribution at each epoch induced by the presence of tyc 4110 s companion ( table [ rv ] ) , we determine the systemic velocity of tyc 4110 , v@xmath65 , to be 25.9 @xmath20.2 km s@xmath5 ( table [ star ] ) .",
    "we also compared these sarg data to broadened versions of kurucz atlas synthetic spectra to constrain the rotational velocity , v@xmath66 , of tyc 4110 . after considering a range of macroturbulence values ,",

    "analysis of post - pipeline processed marvels data involves searching for periodic behavior which is consistent with keplerian orbital motion , and filtering out `` contaminant '' rv signals which do not arise from the presence of a companion .",
    "one of the first steps in this process is to compute a lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodogram @xcite and search for periodic signals which significantly exceed a conservative false alarm probability assessment .",
    "there have been several implementations of this method @xcite ; we followed @xcite which uses the comparison of the @xmath58 values between a sinusoidal fit at a given frequency and a fit to the mean to generate the power term ( see e.g. cumming s equation 2 ) .",
    "this form was chosen to be fully extensible by adding linear terms , harmonic terms , or even a fully keplerian fit .",
    "we stepped through frequency space using steps and a search window as appropriate for our data sampling , as described in @xcite . in order to interpret the significance of this power spectrum , false alarm probabilities ( fap )",
    "were calculated using the techniques in @xcite .",
    "data from the current marvels pipeline have systematic effects present which can mimic a companion signal .",
    "we can significantly mitigate this issue by taking advantage of the fact that the marvels instrument observes 60 stars at a time . as a result",
    ", we can search for periodic signals from all stars on a given plate , and use any detected signals to characterize systematics in our data .",
    "this is done by taking the sum of the power for each frequency across the entire plate .",
    "we then remove the highest power from each frequency ( so that actual companions do not skew the average ) , excluding any power associated with the candidate companion , and compute the average .",
    "figure [ perio ] indicates tyc 4110 exhibits a strong @xmath479-day period signal .",
    "the companion to tyc 4110 , hereafter referred to as marvels-3b , does not match any strong periodic signature identified in the power spectrum of all stars located on the same sdss - iii plate ( bottom panel ; figure [ perio ] ) , and is therefore not caused by any known systematic artifact in our instrument or reduction pipeline .",
    "radial velocities derived from marvels and sarg data were fit with the exofast code @xcite to extract detailed keplerian orbital parameters .",
    "we first performed an independent fit of the marvels data , and re - scaled the marvels error bars to force the probability of @xmath58 , p(@xmath58 ) , = 0.5 .",
    "since we did not have enough sarg data points to perform an independent fit solely on these data , we then fit the combined ( marvels + sarg ) data , and re - scaled the sarg errors to force p(@xmath58 ) = 0.5 .",
    "the fitting of the combined dataset and re - scaling of the sarg errors were iterated until a convergent solution was achieved .",
    "the marvels and ( marvels + sarg ) data yielded consistent results to within 1-@xmath17 of the fit errors .",
    "we also computed the @xmath58 of the sarg data about the marvels - only fit , and the resultant value ( @xmath58 = 8.47 for 5 degrees of freedom ) indicates such a fit would only happen by chance @xmath413% of the time .",
    "we hereafter only consider the combined marvels + sarg fit .",
    "the raw marvels and sarg radial velocities were computed on independent , relative scales .",
    "we determined that the best offsets to simultaneously analyze these data about a zero - point of 0 m s@xmath5 were 1345@xmath67 m s@xmath5 ( sarg ) and 8583 @xmath212 m s@xmath5 ( marvels ) ; the rvs quoted in table [ rv ] have had these offsets applied .",

    "we determined the mass for marvels-3b using : @xmath72 @xmath73    and the fit parameters compiled in table [ fit ] .",
    "this yields a minimum companion mass ( if @xmath6 = 1 ) of 97.7 @xmath25.8 m@xmath7 , which places marvels-3b slightly above the generally accepted brown dwarf upper mass limit of 80 m@xmath7 and into the low - mass star regime . the minimum mass ratio , @xmath9 , of the companion to the primary is 0.087 @xmath20.003 .",
    "the true mass of the companion depends on the inclination @xmath74 of the orbit , which is unknown .",
    "however , we can estimate the posterior probability distribution of the true companion mass , given an isotropic distribution of orbits , and adopting a prior for the distribution of the companion mass ratios .",
    "we proceed to do this using a monte carlo method , following the methodology described in detail in @xcite and @xcite , which we briefly summarize here .",
    "we combine the posterior distribution of orbital parameters @xmath70 , @xmath69 , and @xmath13 obtained from the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) fit to the radial velocity data , with an estimate of the joint distribution of the primary mass and radius obtained using the spectroscopically - determined @xmath75 , and @xmath50 $ ] combined with the @xcite relations , accounting for all sources of uncertainty in the measured values and the relations themselves .",
    "we draw values of @xmath76 from a uniform distribution .",
    "the values of @xmath70 , @xmath69 , and @xmath13 determine the mass function @xmath77 , and then the value of @xmath74 along with the primary mass @xmath78 determines @xmath79 . finally , we appropriately weight the resulting distribution of @xmath79 by our prior on the mass ratio @xmath9 .",
    "as described in section [ intro ] , the mass ratio of companions around g dwarfs is not well constrained by current observations and marvels-3b likely lies in a relatively underpopulated region of mass ratio parameter space .",
    "nevertheless , we consider several different priors on the companion mass ratio which we suggest are reasonable given current observations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , of the form : @xmath80 @xmath81 q@xmath82 , @xmath80 @xmath81 q@xmath5 , and @xmath80 = constant . we note that massive companions are ruled out by the lack of a statistically significant infrared excess in the sed ( figure [ sed ] ) and the lack of a secondary component in our high - resolution optical spectra ( see discussion below ) .",
    "we include this constraint by weighting the resulting distribution of @xmath79 by @xmath83 $ ] , where @xmath84 is the upper limit on the excess flux ( in magnitudes ) in the @xmath70 band , and @xmath85 is the excess flux contributed by a companion of mass @xmath79 and a primary of mass @xmath78 , as determined using the @xcite solar - metallicity , @xmath86 , 1 gyr mass - magnitude relations ( note that we could have adopted any isochrone in the range of 1 - 10 gyr with negligible difference ) . we caution the reader that this specific constraint does not fully and uniformly represent the prior for every possible configuration of the companion , but rather is a reasonable , simplying set of conditions .",
    "we did not observe a statistically significant ir excess flux in tyc 4110 s sed ( figure [ sed ] ) ; thus , we used the 3-@xmath17 standard deviation ( 0.06 magnitudes ) of the ks - band data for @xmath84 .",
    "we note that the ir flux contribution from the wider separation candidate tertiary companion , discussed in more detail in section [ tertiary ] , is less than this @xmath84 and therefore does not influence our mass estimate .",
    "the resultant cumulative distributions of the true mass are shown in figure [ mcmc ] , and we summarize the median mass for each of these priors , along with the resultant mass ratio , in table [ tableofq ] .",
    "since these probabilistic median values rely on the simplifying assumptions we have made , we have not assigned formal confidence limits to these values , to prevent over - interpretation of their robustness .",
    "for each prior , we note that the resultant median mass is in the m dwarf region with a low ( @xmath140.2 ) mass ratio , and companions more massive than 0.5 m@xmath87 are ruled out at the 95% probability level .    finally , we also analyzed the arces spectrum of tyc 4110 , obtained at a phase of @xmath40.71 , to search for evidence of marvels-3b .",
    "we first note that we detected no evidence that the system was a sb2 , which suggests @xmath9 @xmath1 0.65 @xcite , i.e. marvels-3b is less massive than a mid k - type dwarf .",
    "figure [ gus ] illustrates the red optical difference spectrum computed by subtracting the spectrum of a g dwarf with very similar fundamental stellar parameters , hd 153458 , from tyc 4110 .",
    "both the known binary companion to tyc 4110 ( marvels-3b ) and the candidate tertiary companion ( see section [ tertiary ] ) could fill in the spectral features identified with red dots in figure [ gus ] , leading to positive deviations in the difference spectrum , although differentiating the precise amount of any contribution from the secondary versus the candidate tertiary is not possible .",
    "while calibrating our usage of this technique , we found that minor mismatches between the properties of the reference and science spectra could produce noticable subtraction residuals in line wings ( as seen in figure [ gus ] ) , which suggests that only strong , repeatable deviations in these difference spectra should be interpreted as real contributions from companion(s ) . using spectra from the @xcite library",
    ", we estimate that a m3-type companion would have contributed a @xmath42% flux enhancement to the system .",
    "the difference spectrum does not exhibit @xmath883-@xmath17 deviations above the level of the poisson noise ( 0.8% ) and continuum normalization uncertainties present in the data , which sets the lower mass limit for marvels-3b that can be ascertained from these specific data .",
    "triple star systems are a relatively common outcome of the star formation process ( see e.g. , @xcite ) . to further assess the multiplicity of tyc 4110 , we acquired adaptive optics ( ao ) images on 2012 january 7 using nirc2 ( pi : keith matthews ) at the keck observatory in natural guide star mode .",
    "our initial data set consisted of nine dithered images taken in the k@xmath89 filter . inspection of the raw frames showed evidence for a faint candidate companion located to the south - west of tyc 4110 .",
    "figure [ ao ] shows the fully processed k@xmath89 image .",
    "we measured an accurate position for the candidate companion using the technique described in @xcite .",
    "we first fit gaussian functions to the stellar and companion point - spread - functions to locate their centroids in each frame .",
    "the primary star was not saturated in any of our dithered images .",
    "we then correct for distortion in the nirc2 focal plane ( narrow camera mode ) using the publicly available software provided by the keck observatory astrometry support page.@xmath90 the results are averaged and the uncertainty in the separation and position angle is taken as the standard deviation , taking into account uncertainty in the plate scale and orientation of the array by propagating these errors to the final calculated position . adopting a plate scale of @xmath91 mas pixel@xmath5 and instrument orientation relative to the sky of @xmath92 ,",
    "as measured by @xcite , we find a companion separation and position angle of @xmath93 mas and @xmath94 respectively .    upon noticing the companion , we obtained additional images in the j and h - bands to facilitate characterization .",
    "our aperture photometry indicates that the object has red colors : @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 mags .",
    "3table ] lists its apparent magnitude as measured relative to the primary star , taking into account the combined light from each source .",
    "both the ( j - h ) = 0.55 and ( j - k@xmath89 ) = 0.75 colors indicate a spectral type of @xmath4m3v @xcite .",
    "assuming the candidate is situated at the same distance as the primary , we find that the absolute magnitudes , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , are each consistent with a @xmath101 star when compared to the @xcite evolutionary models , which corresponds to a main - sequence spectral type of @xmath4dm4 .",
    "the relations from table 5 of @xcite yield the same result ( dm4 ) , though with a possibly lower mass estimate of @xmath102 .",
    "given the ra and dec and distance of tyc 4110 , the a priori likelihood of detecting a background star within 1@xmath160 is @xmath40.8% . with a proper motion of [ -0.20 , -99.40 ] mas yr@xmath5 , a time baseline of several months will be sufficient to assess its association with the primary star .",
    "we note that the detection and mass constraints placed on marvels-3b in this paper hold regardless of whether or not this candidate tertiary companion is confirmed to be co - moving with the primary star .",
    "we discuss some of the derived properties for marvels-3b in the context of previous studies of low - mass companions to solar - like stars .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite demonstrate that companions to solar - like stars having orbital periods @xmath1212 days are circular ; however , companions having orbital periods similar to that of marvels-3b , @xmath479 days , exhibit eccentricities from 0 - 0.6 @xcite .",
    "marvels-3b s modest eccentricity of @xmath40.11 therefore is clearly consistent with that observed for other similar period companions .",
    "arguably the most distinctive feature of tyc 4110 is its extremely low mass ratio , @xmath9 , of @xmath80.087 @xmath20.003 , given its relatively short @xmath479-day period .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ q ] , previous statistical investigations of binarity in solar - like ( @xmath0 k ) stars have found evidence that the short period brown dwarf desert extends in mass toward the low mass star regime @xcite .",
    "a similar desert of short - period , low @xmath9 companions to low - mass k and m dwarf stars has also been observed ( figure [ q ] ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "the studies of companions around solar - like stars by both @xcite and @xcite report no firm detection of low @xmath9 binary companions with orbital periods @xmath14100 days .",
    "the closest short period analog observed by @xcite ( see e.g. their figure 17 ) is a multiple ( @xmath88 2 components ) @xmath9 @xmath40.23 system with an orbital period of @xmath450 days , while the closest short period binary is a @xmath41-day period object with a @xmath9 of @xmath40.4 .",
    "all other low @xmath9 binaries in their sample have orbital periods @xmath85000 days . @xcite also report a sparse number of low @xmath9 binary companions to solar - like stars , but do not quantify the orbital periods of these objects .",
    "the absolute `` dryness '' of the low mass ratio , short period desert for solar - like ( @xmath0 k ) illustrated in figure [ q ] is a subject of active investigation and debate in the literature .",
    "ogle - tr-122b @xcite , kepler-16b @xcite , and vb 69 @xcite are short period , low @xmath9 , solar - like binary systems that populate this parameter space . the statistical frequency of objects like ogle - tr-122b and kepler-16b have not been quantified by the ogle or kepler surveys ; hence , it is plausible that they are indeed rare .",
    "we note that there have been suggestions the mass ratios of binary companions surrounding f7 to k - type stars are more broadly distrubuted and that no clear low mass ratio desert exists ( see figure 8 in @xcite ) .",
    "however , we have included all of the companions surrounding g - type ( 0.8 m@xmath3 @xmath14 m @xmath14 1.1 m@xmath3 ) and k- and m - type primaries tabulated in @xcite ( but omitting data from their survey which was not tabulated in print or online ) in figure [ q ] , and still clearly see a short period , low mass ratio companion deficit . clearly",
    ", additional observational studies which precisely characterize the stellar properties of the host star and characterize the properties of their binary companions are needed to perform an accurate meta - analysis of the dependence of companion mass ratios as a function of orbital period and host star mass .",
    "these studies should make careful note of their observational biases to facilitate a more robust cross - correlation of results compiled from different surveys .",
    "a future meta - analysis would also particularly benefit from having current and future studies fully tabulating the fundamental properties of the binary systems they investigate .",
    "as noted in section [ intro ] , short - period , low @xmath9 companions have been reported around stars slightly more massive that the sun ( f - type stars ; @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "propose that short - period low @xmath9 companions might form around a wide mass range of stars , including g - type stars , but suggest that weaker magnetic disk braking during the early formation history of f - type stars might transfer less angular momentum to their companion bodies , thereby preventing catastrophic decays of their orbits .",
    "conversely , @xcite propose that a stronger disk braking in young g - type stars might distribute more angular momentum to their companion bodies , causing ( initially ) short - period companions to migrate inwards and become engulfed by the primary .",
    "while intriguing , this proposed evolutionary scenario would clearly benefit by a more robust assessment of how `` dry '' the short - period , low @xmath9 desert is around gkm dwarfs as compared to f dwarfs .",
    "the precise mass ratio of marvels-3b is not known due to the unknown inclination of the system , thus our observations only set a lower limit of @xmath9 of @xmath880.087 @xmath20.003 . however , as demonstrated in section [ companion ] , our bayesian analysis of the system using 4 plausible prior assumptions all indicate the likely median mass of marvels-3b is a dm star , yielding mass ratios of 0.087 @xmath14 @xmath9 @xmath14 0.149 ( figure [ mcmc ] and table [ tableofq ] ) . like ogle - tr-122b @xcite and kepler-16b @xcite , marvels-3b therefore seems likely to be an outlier to the mass ratio - period relationships commonly observed for both solar - like stars and lower - mass dm stars ( figure [ q ] ) .    in this context , we note that analyses of the period distribution of exoplanets have revealed a deficit of such bodies having orbital periods of 10 - 100 days , aka the `` period valley '' @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that this observed deficit is real for the giant planet population ( m @xmath88 100 m@xmath103 ) , but that any deficit of lower mass planets ( 10 - 100 m@xmath103 ) in this period regime might be the result of selection effects .",
    "one possible explanation for the dearth of giant planets in 10 - 100 day orbits is a decrease in the amount of orbital migration which such objects experience ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "migration could also play a role in setting the observed period distribution of the low - mass stellar binary regime .",
    "the orbital evolution of binaries has been explored computationally , and stellar accretion , the interaction between binaries with their natal gas disks , and interactions between triple components can influence these systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite , for example , found such processes were successful at producing short - period binaries in high mass ratio systems ( @xmath9 @xmath8 0.3 ) , but it is uncertain as to whether these specific simulations could produce short - period , low @xmath9 systems like marvels-3b .",
    "n - body simulations of the early evolution of stellar clusters which include instantaneous gas removal @xcite are beginning to better reproduce the number of unequal mass solar - like binaries observed @xcite .",
    "potentially relevant for marvels-3b , @xcite showed that one simulated triple system comprised of a 0.96 and 0.73 m@xmath3 , 2 au separation binary with a 0.21 m@xmath3 tertiary at 12 au , broke up into a tight ( 0.1 au separation ) binary system comprised of the 0.21 and 0.73 m@xmath3 components ( e.g. a mass ratio , @xmath9 , of 0.29 ) .",
    "we therefore speculate that it is possible that the short period , low @xmath9 marvels-3b binary was initially part of a tertiary ( or larger ) system with much different initial orbital parameters , and only achieved its final orbital configuration following the dispersal of the cluster in which it formed .",
    "although our analysis of available superwasp photometry and marvels+sarg radial velocity data exhibited no evidence of the presence of additional , long - period ( @xmath8 2 years ) bodies in the system , our single - epoch detection of a candidate tertiary body in the system via high contrast imaging could support this interpretation .",
    "additional epochs of imagery should be pursued to establish if this body is co - moving with the tyc 4110 system .",
    "although beyond the scope of this paper , future simulations of binary migration and orbital evolution during cluster dispersal should explore the limits and frequency at which they can reproduce short period , low mass ratio binaries for solar - like stars .",
    "we present a detailed analysis of the fundamental properties of the solar - like star tyc 4110 - 01037 - 1 and its very low mass stellar companion .",
    "this analysis was performed in the context of our long - term goal of performing a detailed statistical analysis of global trends in the population of well vetted and characterized bds and low mass binary companions identified by the marvels survey .",
    "we find :    * tyc 4110 - 01037 - 1 is a @xmath15 gyr solar - like star characterized by @xmath75 = 5879 @xmath229 k , = 4.48 @xmath20.15 , and @xmath50 $ ] = -0.01 @xmath20.05 .",
    "we determine the stellar mass to be 1.07 @xmath20.08 m@xmath3 and stellar radius to be 0.99 @xmath20.18 r@xmath3 .",
    "* marvels-3b is a @xmath8897.7 @xmath25.8 m@xmath7 ( m@xmath6 ) companion to tyc 4110 - 01037 - 1 , which follows a moderately elliptical ( e = 0.1095 @xmath20.0023 ) , 78.994 @xmath20.012 day orbital period . *",
    "the mass ratio , q , of the companion to the primary is @xmath8 0.087 @xmath20.003 .",
    "marvels-3b therefore resides in a short period , low @xmath9 desert analogous to the short period brown dwarf desert .",
    "* we speculate that marvels-3b might have initially formed in a tertiary system with much different orbital parameters , and achieved its present day configuration following the dispersal of the cluster in which it formed .",
