    "the classical lagrangian for qcd couples left and right handed quark fields only through mass terms .",
    "thus naively the massless theory will have independent conserved currents associated with each handedness .",
    "for @xmath0 massless flavors , this would be an independent @xmath1 symmetry associated with each chirality , giving a full symmetry that is often written in terms of axial and vector fields as @xmath2 .",
    "as is well known , this full symmetry does not survive quantization , being broken to a @xmath3 , where the @xmath4 represents the symmetry of baryon number conservation .",
    "the only surviving axial symmetries of the quantum theory are non - singlet under flavor symmetry .",
    "this breaking of the classical @xmath5 axial symmetry is tied to the possibility of introducing into massive qcd a cp violating parameter , usually called @xmath6 . for an extensive recent review of this quantity ,",
    "see ref .  @xcite .",
    "while such a term is allowed from fundamental principles , experimentally it appears to be extremely small .",
    "this raises an unresolved puzzle for attempts to unify the strong interactions with the weak . since the weak interactions do violate cp ,",
    "why is there no residue of this remaining in the strong sector below the unification scale ?",
    "one goal here is to provide a qualitative picture of the @xmath6 parameter in meson physics .",
    "i will concentrate on symmetry alone and will not attempt to rely on any specific form for an effective lagrangian .",
    "i build on a connection between @xmath6 and a flavor - singlet @xmath7 symmetry that survives the anomaly .",
    "this symmetry predicts that , if the lightest quarks are massive and degenerate , then a first order transition is expected when @xmath6 passes through @xmath8 .",
    "this transition is quite generic , and only can be avoided under limited conditions with one quark considerably lighter than the others .",
    "it will also become clear why the sign of the quark mass is relevant for an odd number of flavors , an effect unseen in naive perturbation theory .",
    "this picture has evolved over many years .",
    "the possibility of the spontaneous cp violation occurring at @xmath9 is tied to what is known as dashen s phenomenon @xcite , first noted even before the days of qcd . in the mid 1970 s ,",
    "t hooft @xcite elucidated the underlying connection between the chiral anomaly and the topology of gauge fields .",

    "@xcite contains a different approach to understanding the transition at @xmath9 via the framework of the two - flavor nambu jona - lasinio model .",
    "i became interested in the issues while trying to understand difficulties with formulating chiral symmetry on the lattice .",
    "much of the picture presented here is implicit in my 1995 paper on quark masses @xcite .",
    "since then the topic has become highly controversial , with the realization of ambiguities precluding a vanishing up quark mass solving the strong cp problem @xcite and the appearance of an inconsistency with one of the popular algorithms in lattice gauge theory @xcite . despite the controversies , both are direct consequences of the interplay of the anomaly and chiral symmetry discussed here .",
    "the fact that these issues remain so disputed is what has driven me to write this overview .",

    "section [ summary ] draws concluding remarks .",
    "i start with a few reasonably uncontroversial assumptions .",
    "first qcd with @xmath0 light quarks should exist as a field theory and exhibit confinement in the usual way .",
    "i assume the validity of the standard picture of chiral symmetry breaking involving a quark condensate @xmath10 .",
    "the conventional chiral perturbation theory based on expanding in masses and momenta around the chiral limit should make sense .",
    "i assume the usual result that the anomaly generates a mass for the @xmath11 particle with this mass surviving in the chiral limit .",
    "and i consider @xmath0 small enough to avoid any potential conformal phase of qcd @xcite .    throughout",
    "i use the language of continuum field theory .",
    "i do have in mind that some non - perturbative regulator has been imposed to define various products of fields , such as the condensing combination @xmath12 . for a momentum space cutoff",
    ", i assume that it is much larger than @xmath13 .",
    "correspondingly , for a lattice cutoff , then i imagine that the lattice spacing is much smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "thus i ignore any lattice artifacts that are expected to vanish in the continuum limit .",
    "i begin by considering an effective potential @xmath15 as a function of the various meson fields in the problem .",
    "intuitively , @xmath15 represents the energy of the lowest state for a given field expectation .",
    "more formally , this can be defined in the standard way via a legendre transformation .",
    "i will ignore the well known result that effective potentials must be convex functions of their arguments .",
    "this is easily understood in terms of a maxwell construction involving the phase separation that will occur if one asks for a field expectation in what would otherwise be a concave region .",
    "ignoring this effect allows me to use the normal language of spontaneous symmetry breaking corresponding to having an effective potential with more than one minimum .",
    "when the underlying theory possesses some symmetry but the individual minima do not , spontaneous breaking comes about when the vacuum selects one minimum arbitrarily .",
    "i frame the discussion in terms of composite scalar and pseudoscalar fields @xmath16 here the @xmath17 are the generalization of the usual gell - mann matrices to @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath19 field is listed here for completeness , but will not play a role in the following discussion . as mentioned earlier , i assume some sort of regulator , perhaps a lattice , is in place to define these products of fields at the same point",
    ".    initially consider degenerate quarks with a small common mass @xmath20 .",
    "i also begin by restricting @xmath0 to be even , returning later to the subtleties arising for an odd number of flavors . and , as mentioned earlier , i keep @xmath0 small enough to maintain asymptotic freedom as well as to avoid any possible conformal phases .",
    "the conventional picture of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking at @xmath21 begins with the vacuum acquiring a quark condensate with @xmath22 . in terms of the effective potential",
    ", @xmath23 should acquire a double well structure , as sketched in fig .",
    "the symmetry under @xmath24 is associated with the invariance of the action under a flavored chiral rotation .",
    "for example , with two flavors the change of variables @xmath25 leaves the massless action invariant but changes the sign of @xmath26 .",
    "here @xmath27 is the conventional pauli matrix corresponding to the third component of isospin .",
    "extending the effective potential to a function of the non - singlet pseudoscalar fields gives the standard picture of goldstone bosons .",
    "these are massless when the quark mass vanishes , corresponding to @xmath28 `` flat '' directions for the potential .",
    "it is useful to introduce the @xmath18 valued effective field @xmath29 where the matrices @xmath30 generalize of the gell - mann matrices to @xmath18 , flavor indices that make this a matrix quantity are suppressed , and the pion decay constant @xmath31 is inserted as a convenient normalization but will play no role in the qualitative discussion here .",
    "the left and right fermi fields are defined as usual by @xmath32 . in terms of @xmath33 the chiral invariance of the potential takes the simple form @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are arbitrary elements of @xmath18 .",
    "one flat direction is sketched in fig .",
    "[ v0 ] .",
    "the introduction of a small mass for the quarks effectively tilts the potential @xmath37 .",
    "this selects one of the minima as the true vacuum , driving the above matrix @xmath38 .",
    "the tilting of the potential breaks the global symmetry and gives the goldstone bosons a small mass proportional to the square root of the quark mass , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ v3 ]        this picture is , of course , completely standard . it is also common lore that the anomaly prevents the @xmath11 from being a goldstone boson and leaves it with a mass of order @xmath13 even in the massless quark limit .",
    "the effective potential @xmath15 must not be symmetric under the following anomalous rotation by an angle @xmath39 @xmath40    if we consider the effective potential as a function of the fields @xmath26 and @xmath11 , it should have a minimum at @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "expanding about that point we expect a qualitative form @xmath43 where both @xmath44 and @xmath45 remain of order @xmath13 , even in the chiral limit . and",
    ", at least with an even number of flavors as considered here , there should be a second minimum with @xmath46 .",
    "expanding about this point gives the @xmath47    at this point one can ask whether we know anything else about the effective potential in this @xmath48 plane . in section [ znf ] i show that indeed we do , and the potential has a total of @xmath0 equivalent minima in the chiral limit .",
    "but first i digress to review how the above minima arise in quark language .",
    "the classical qcd lagrangian has a symmetry under a rotation of the underlying quark fields @xmath49 this corresponds directly to the transformation of the composite fields given in eq .",
    "[ rotate ] .",
    "this symmetry is `` anomalous '' and thus any regulator must break it with a remnant surviving in the continuum limit .",
    "the specifics of how this works depend on the details of the regulator , but a simple understanding @xcite comes from considering the fermionic measure in the path integral . if we make the above rotation on the field @xmath50 , the measure changes by the determinant of the rotation matrix @xmath51 here the subtlety of the regulator comes in .",
    "naively @xmath52 is a simple four by four traceless matrix .",
    "if it is indeed traceless , then the measure would be invariant .",
    "however in the regulated theory this is not the case .",
    "this is intimately tied with the index theorem for the dirac operator in topologically non - trivial gauge fields .",
    "a typical dirac action takes the form @xmath53 with @xmath54 a function of the gauge fields . in the naive continuum theory @xmath54",
    "is anti - hermitian , @xmath55 , and anti - commutes with @xmath52 , i.e. @xmath56_+=0 $ ] .",
    "what complicates the issue with fermions is the well known index theorem : if a background gauge field has winding @xmath57 , then there are known to be at least @xmath57 exact zero eigenvalues of @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , on the space spanned by the corresponding eigenvectors , @xmath52 can be simultaneously diagonalized with @xmath54 .",
    "the net winding number equals the number of positive eigenvalues of @xmath52 minus the number of negative eigenvalues .",
    "this theorem is well known and well reviewed elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "i only will use the fact that in this subspace the trace of @xmath52 does not vanish , but equals @xmath57 .    what about the higher eigenvalues of @xmath54 ? because @xmath56_+=0 $ ] ,",
    "these appear in opposite sign pairs ; i.e. if @xmath58 then @xmath59 .",
    "for an anti - hermitean @xmath54 , these modes are orthogonal with @xmath60 . as a consequence ,",
    "@xmath52 is traceless on the subspace spanned by each pair of eigenvectors .",
    "so what happened to the opposite chirality states to the zero modes ? in a regulated theory they are in some sense `` above the cutoff . '' in a simple continuum discussion they have been `` lost at infinity . '' with a lattice regulator there is no `` infinity '' ; so , something more subtle must happen . with the overlap@xcite or wilson@xcite fermions ,",
    "one gives up the anti - hermiticity of @xmath54 .",
    "most eigenvalues still occur in conjugate pairs and do not contribute to the trace of @xmath52 . however , in addition to the small real eigenvalues representing the zero modes , there are additional modes where the eigenvalues are large and real . with wilson fermions",
    "these appear as massive doubler states . with the overlap ,",
    "the eigenvalues are constrained to lie on a circle . in this case",
    ", for every exact zero mode there is another mode of opposite chirality lying on the opposite side of the circle .",
    "these modes are effectively massive and break chiral symmetry .",
    "so with the regulator in place , the trace of @xmath52 does not vanish on gauge configurations of non - trivial topology .",
    "the change of variables indicated in eq .",
    "[ measure ] introduces into the path integral a modification of the weighting by a factor @xmath61 here i consider applying the rotation to all flavors equally , thus the factor of @xmath0 in the exponent .",
    "the conclusion is that gauge configurations that have non - trivial topology receive a complex weight after the anomalous rotation .",
    "this changes the underlying physics and gives an inequivalent theory .",
    "although not the topic of discussion here , note that this factor introduces a sign problem if one wishes to study this physics via monte carlo simulations . here",
    "i have treated all @xmath0 flavors equivalently ; this corresponds to dividing the conventionally defined cp violation angle , to be discussed later , equally among the flavors , i.e. effectively @xmath62 .",
    "the necessary involvement of both small and large eigenvalues warns of the implicit danger in attempts to separate infrared from ultraviolet effects .",
    "when the anomaly is concerned , going to short distances is not sufficient for ignoring non - perturbative effects related to topology .",

    "[ potential0 ] .",
    "do we know anything about the potential elsewhere in this plane ?",

    "as noted before , due to the anomaly the singlet rotation @xmath64 is not a valid symmetry of the theory for generic values of the angle @xmath39 . on the other hand , flavored chiral symmetries",
    "should survive , and in particular @xmath65 should be a valid symmetry for any set of angles @xmath66 .",
    "the point of this section is that , for special special discrete values of the angles , the rotations in eq .",

    "[ flavored ] can coincide . at such values",
    "the singlet rotation is a valid symmetry . in particular , note that @xmath67 thus a valid discrete symmetry involving only @xmath26 and @xmath11 is @xmath68 the potential @xmath69 has a @xmath7 symmetry manifested in @xmath0 equivalent minima in the @xmath48 plane . for four flavors this structure",
    "is sketched in fig .",
    "[ potential1 ] .",
    "this discrete flavor singlet symmetry arises from the trivial fact that @xmath70 is a subgroup of both @xmath71 and @xmath5 . at the quark level",
    "the symmetry is easily understood since the t hooft vertex , responsible for the chiral anomaly , receives one factor from every flavor . with @xmath72 flavors , these multiply together making @xmath73 a valid symmetry even though rotations by smaller angles are not .",
    "the role of the @xmath70 center of @xmath71 is illustrated graphically in fig .",

    "the region of support only touches the @xmath5 circle at the elements of the center .",
    "all elements lie on or within the curve mapped out by elements of form @xmath75 .",
    "[ su4circle ] is a similar plot for the group @xmath76 .",
    "as discussed earlier and illustrated in fig .  [ potential1 ] , a quark mass term @xmath77 is represented by a `` tilting '' of the effective potential .",
    "this selects one of the minima in the @xmath63 plane as the true vacuum . for masses small",
    "compared to the scale of qcd , the other minima will persist , although due to the flat flavor non - singlet directions , some of them will become unstable under small fluctuations . counting the minima sequentially with the true vacuum having @xmath78 ,",
    "each is associated with small excitations in the pseudo - goldstone directions having an effective mass of @xmath79 .",
    "thus when @xmath0 exceeds four , there will be more than one meta - stable state .",
    "conventionally the mass tilts the potential downward in the @xmath26 direction .",
    "however , it is interesting to consider tilts in other directions in the @xmath63 plane .",
    "this can be accomplished by doing an anomalous rotation on the mass term @xmath80 were it not for the anomaly , this would just be a redefinition of fields .",
    "however the same effect that gives the @xmath11 its mass indicates that this new form for the mass term gives an inequivalent theory . as @xmath81 is odd under cp , this theory is explicitly cp violating .",
    "the conventional notation for this effect involves the angle @xmath82 .",
    "then the @xmath7 symmetry amounts to a @xmath83 periodicity in @xmath6 . as fig .",
    "[ potential ] indicates , at special values of the twisting angle @xmath39 , there will exist two degenerate minima .",
    "this occurs , for example , at @xmath84 or @xmath9 .",
    "as the twisting increases through this point , there will be a first order transition as the true vacuum jumps from one minimum to the next .",
    "one interesting consequence of this analysis is the behavior of qcd with an odd number of flavors .",
    "the group @xmath18 with odd @xmath0 does not include the element @xmath85 .",
    "in particular , the @xmath7 structure is not symmetric under reflections about the @xmath11 axis .",
    "[ potential2 ] sketches the situation for @xmath74 .",
    "one immediate consequence is that positive and negative mass are not equivalent . indeed ,",
    "a negative mass corresponds to @xmath9 where a spontaneous breaking of cp is expected . in this case",
    "the simple picture sketched in fig .",
    "[ v1 ] no longer applies .    at @xmath9",
    "the theory lies on top of a first order phase transition line .",
    "a simple order parameter for this transition is the expectation value for the @xmath11 field . as this field is odd under cp symmetry",
    ", this is another way to see that negative mass qcd with an odd number of flavors spontaneously breaks cp .",
    "this does not contradict the vafa - witten theorem @xcite because in this regime the fermion determinant is not positive definite .",
    "note that the asymmetry in the sign of the quark mass is not easily seen in perturbation theory .",
    "any quark loop in a perturbative diagram can have the sign of the quark mass flipped by a @xmath52 transformation .",
    "it is only through the subtleties of regulating the divergent triangle diagram @xcite , @xcite that the sign of the mass enters .",
    "a special case of an odd number of flavors is one - flavor qcd . in this case",
    "the anomaly removes all chiral symmetry and there is a unique minimum in the @xmath63 plane , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ potential3 ] .",
    "this minimum does not occur at the origin , being shifted to @xmath86 by t hooft vertex , which for one flavor is just an additive mass shift @xcite . unlike the case with more flavors , this expectation can not be regarded as a spontaneous symmetry breaking since there is no chiral symmetry to break .",
    "any regulator that preserves a remnant of chiral symmetry must inevitably fail @xcite .",
    "note also that there is no longer the necessity of a first order phase transition at @xmath9 .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that for finite quark mass such a transition can occur if the mass is sufficiently negative , but the region around vanishing mass has no distinguishing structure .",
    "one feature of one - flavor qcd is that the renormalization of the quark mass is not multiplicative when non - perturbative effects are taken into account .",
    "the additive mass shift is generally scheme dependent since the details of the instanton effects depend on scale .",
    "this is the basic reason that a massless up quark is not a possible solution to the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "because of this shift , the conventional variables @xmath6 and @xmath20 are singular coordinates for the one - flavor theory .",
    "a cleaner set of variables would be the coefficients of the two possible mass terms @xmath87 and @xmath88 appearing in the lagrangian .",
    "the ambiguity in the quark mass is tied to rough gauge configurations with ambiguous winding number .",
    "this applies even to the formally elegant overlap operator ; when rough gauge fields are present , the existence of a zero mode can depend on the detailed operator chosen to project onto the overlap circle .",
    "smoothness conditions imposed on the gauge fields to remove this ambiguity appear to conflict with fundamental principles , such as reflection positivity @xcite .",
    "the @xmath7 symmetry discussed here is a property of the fermion determinant and is independent of the gauge field dynamics . in monte carlo simulation language ,",
    "this symmetry appears configuration by configuration . with @xmath0 flavors",
    ", we always have @xmath89 for any gauge field .",
    "this discrete chiral symmetry is inherently discontinuous in @xmath0 .",
    "this non - continuity lies at the heart of the controversy over the rooted staggered quark approximation to lattice gauge theory .",
    "the details of this issue are extensively discussed elsewhere @xcite , but the essence is that the four species inherent with staggered quarks give rise to an unphysical extra @xmath90 which current algorithms do not remove .",
    "it is possible to interpolate between various numbers of flavors by adjusting the quark masses .",
    "construct an @xmath71 valued effective field @xmath91 .",
    "if , for instance , we give one flavor a large mass , this will drive one component of @xmath33 to unity @xmath92 leading one to the above discussion with one less flavor .",
    "a complication arises since the breaking of the @xmath18 flavor symmetry by a non - singlet mass term allows mixing of the @xmath11 field with the flavored analog of the @xmath93 .",
    "as the heavier quark mass increases we should adjust what is meant by @xmath11 , but qualitatively the transformation from , say , four to three flavors should look something like what is sketched in fig .",
    "[ potential4 ] , where one of the minima moves up to disappear and the others rearrange .",
    "continuing down from an odd number of flavors to an even number , then the two degenerate minima at negative mass should merge , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ potential5 ] . for arbitrary masses",
    "the situation becomes increasingly complicated . in ref .",
    "@xcite the expected phase diagram is mapped out for the case of three flavors with arbitrary real masses .",
    "there it is shown that there are large regions both with and without a first order transition at @xmath9 .",
    "the first order transition at @xmath9 remains robust as long as multiple lightest quarks are degenerate and their masses remain in the regime where chiral expansions make sense .",
    "regardless of any heavier quarks , the above symmetry arguments hold for the light quarks when the heavier masses are held fixed .",
    "only when the lightest quark is non - degenerate can a gap appear separating the region of spontaneous cp violation at negative quark mass from zero mass .",
    "the size of this gap is controlled by the heavier quark masses .",
    "i have discussed how the anomalous breaking of the classical @xmath5 axial symmetry in qcd interplays with the spontaneously broken flavored axial symmetries . with @xmath0 massless",
    "quarks a flavor singlet discrete @xmath7 chiral symmetry is left behind .",
    "this provides an intuitive interpretation of the strong cp violating angle @xmath6 in terms of effective meson fields . as a consequence , a first order transition is generally expected at @xmath9 and @xmath94",
    "this is quite robust and can only be avoided if one quark is considerably lighter than the others . at @xmath9",
    "the qcd lagrangian is cp invariant ; so , the transition represents a spontaneous breaking of this discrete symmetry .",
    "the physics of the anomaly indicates that the signs of quark masses can be significant , something that is not naturally interpreted perturbatively . in the special case of one flavor , all chiral symmetry is lost .",
    "one consequence is that the mass of a non - degenerate light quark is unprotected from an additive and scheme dependent renormalization .",
    "furthermore , any proposed regulator that maintains an exact chiral symmetry for the one flavor case must fail .",
