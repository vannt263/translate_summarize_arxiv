    "since the liquid drop model was developed @xcite , the quadrupole shape coordinates were widely used by both phenomenological and microscopic formalisms to describe the basic properties of nuclear systems .",
    "based on these coordinates , one defines quadrupole boson operators in terms of which model hamiltonians and transition operators are defined . since the original spherical harmonic liquid drop model was able to describe only a small amount of data for spherical nuclei , several improvements have been added .",
    "thus , the bohr - mottelson model was generalized by faessler and greiner @xcite in order to describe the small oscillations around a deformed shape which results in obtaining a flexible model , called vibration rotation model , suitable for the description of deformed nuclei .",
    "later on @xcite this picture was extended by including anharmonicities as low order invariant polynomials in the quadrupole coordinates . with a suitable choice of the parameters involved in the model hamiltonian the equipotential energy surface may exhibit several types of minima @xcite like spherical , deformed prolate , deformed oblate , deformed triaxial , etc . to each equilibrium shape , specific properties for excitation energies and electromagnetic transition probabilities show up . due to this reason",
    ", one customarily says that static values of intrinsic coordinates determine a phase for the nuclear system .",
    "the boson description with a complex anharmonic hamiltonian makes use of a large number of structure parameters which are to be fitted .",
    "a smaller number of parameters is used by the coherent state model ( csm ) @xcite which uses a restricted collective space generated through angular momentum projection by three deformed orthogonal functions of coherent type .",
    "the model is able to describe in a realistic fashion transitional and well deformed nuclei of various shapes including states of high and very high angular momentum .",
    "various extensions to include other degrees of freedom like isospin @xcite , single particle @xcite or octupole @xcite degrees of freedom have been formulated @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that a given nuclear shape may be associated with a certain symmetry .",
    "hence , its properties may be described with the help of the irreducible representation of the respective symmetry group .",
    "thus , the gamma unstable nuclei can be described by the @xmath8 symmetry @xcite , the gamma - rigid triaxial rotor by the @xmath9 symmetry @xcite , the symmetric rotor by the @xmath10 symmetry and the spherical vibrator by the @xmath11 symmetry .",
    "thus , even in the 50 s , the symmetry properties have been greatly appreciated .",
    "however , a big push forward was brought by the interacting boson approximation ( iba ) @xcite , which succeeded to describe the basic properties of a large number of nuclei in terms of the symmetries associated to a system of quadrupole ( d ) and monopole ( s ) bosons which generate the @xmath12 algebra of the iba .",
    "the three limiting symmetries @xmath11 , @xmath8 and @xmath10 mentioned above in the context of the collective model are also dynamic symmetries for @xmath12 .",
    "moreover , for each of these symmetries a specific group reduction chain provides the quantum numbers characterizing the states , which are suitable for a certain region of nuclei . besides the virtue of unifying the group theoretical descriptions of nuclei exhibiting different symmetries",
    ", the procedure defines very simple reference pictures for the limiting cases . for nuclei lying close to the region characterized by a certain symmetry ,",
    "the perturbative corrections are to be included .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has been proved that on the @xmath13 transition leg there exists a critical point for a second order phase transition while the @xmath14 leg has a first order phase transition .",
    "actually , the first order phase transition takes place not only on the mentioned leg of the casten s triangle but covers all te interior of the triangle up to the second order @xcite .",
    "examples of such nuclei , falling insider the triangle , are the @xmath15 isotopes @xcite . .    recently , iachello @xcite pointed out that these critical points correspond to distinct symmetries , namely @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively . for the critical value of an ordering parameter",
    ", energies are given by the zeros of a bessel function of half integer and irrational indices , respectively .",
    "the description of low lying states in terms of bessel functions was used first by jean and willet @xcite , but the interesting feature saying that this is a critical picture in a phase transition and defines a new symmetry , was indeed advanced first in ref.@xcite .",
    "representatives for the two symmetries have been experimentally identified . to give an example , the relevant data for @xmath18ba @xcite and @xmath19sm @xcite suggest that they are close to the @xmath16 and @xmath17 symmetries , respectively .",
    "another candidate for e(5 ) symmetry , is @xmath20pd @xcite .",
    "a systematic search for @xmath16 behavior in nuclei has been reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "in ref.@xcite we advanced the hypothesis that the critical point in a phase transition is state dependent .",
    "we tested this with a hybrid model for @xmath18ba and @xmath21ru .",
    "similar property of the phase transition was investigated in the context of a schematic two level model in ref .",
    "a rigorous analysis of the the characteristics of excited state quantum phase transitions is performed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the departure from the @xmath1 unstable picture has been treated by several authors @xcite whose contributions are reviewed by fortunato in ref.@xcite .",
    "the difficulty in treating the @xmath1 degree of freedom consists in the fact that this variable is coupled to the rotation variables .",
    "a full solution for the bohr - mottelson hamiltonian including an explicit treatment of @xmath1 deformation variable can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "therein , we treated separately also the @xmath1 unstable and the rotor hamiltonian . a more complete study of the rotor hamiltonian and the distinct phases associated to a tilted moving rotor is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the treatment of the @xmath1 variable becomes even more complicated when we add to the liquid drop hamiltonian a potential depending on @xmath0 and @xmath1 at a time . to simplify the starting problem related to the inclusion of the @xmath1 variable one uses model potentials which are sums of a beta and a @xmath1 depending potentials . in this way",
    "the nice feature for the beta variable to be decoupled from the remaining 4 variables , specific to the harmonic liquid drop , is preserved .",
    "further the potential in @xmath1 is expanded either around to @xmath22 or around @xmath23 . in the first case",
    "if only the singular term is retained one obtains the infinite square well model described by bessel functions in gamma .",
    "if the @xmath24 term is added to this term , the laguerre functions are the eigenstates of the approximated gamma depending hamiltonian , which results in defining the functions characterizing the x(5 ) approach .",
    "the drawback of these approximation consists in that the resulting @xmath1 depending functions are not periodic as the starting hamiltonian is . moreover",
    ", they are orthonormalized on unbound intervals although the underlying equation was derived under the condition of @xmath25 small . the scalar product for the space of the resulting functions is not defined based on the measure @xmath26 as happens in the liquid drop model .",
    "under these circumstances it happens that the approximated hamiltonian in @xmath1 looses its hermiticity .    in some earlier publications @xcite we proposed a scheme where the gamma variable is described by a solvable hamiltonian whose eigenstates are spheroidal functions which are periodic .",
    "here we give details about the calculations and describe some new numerical applications .",
    "moreover , the formalism was completed by treating the @xmath0 variable by a schrdinger equation associated to the davidson s potential .",
    "alternatively we considered the equation for a five dimensional square well potential .",
    "we have shown that the new treatment of the gamma variable removes the drawbacks mentioned above and moreover brings a substantial improvement of the numerical analysis .    here",
    "we keep the description of the gamma variable by spheroidal functions and use a new potential for the beta variable which seems to be more suitable for a realistic description of more complex spectra .",
    "we call this approach as sextic and spheroidal approach ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the potential is that of a sextic oscillator plus a centrifugal term which leads to a quasi - exactly solvable model . the resulting formalism will be applied to 10 nuclei which were not included in our previous descriptions and moreover are suspected to be good candidate for exhibiting @xmath17 features having the ratio of excitation energies of the ground band members @xmath28 and @xmath29 close to the value of 2.9 .",

    "the results are compared with the corresponding experimental data as well as with those obtained through other formalisms called x(5 ) , isw , d and csm which were earlier used by the present authors to describe the spectroscopic properties of other x(5 ) like nuclei .",
    "note that while the formalisms x(5 ) , isw , d and ssa treat the energies and transition probabilities using the intrinsic coordinates and the rotation matrix function , the csm is a quadrupole boson approach and therefore the mentioned observables are calculated with the collective coordinates which are specific to the laboratory frame .    a comparison of the r.m.s .",
    "values yielded by the five approaches shows that the d , csm and ssa approaches produce the best agreement with the experimental energies .",
    "concerning the e2 transitions one may say that all five sets of results quantitatively describe the experimental situation in a comparable manner with a slight advantage for ssa and csm . since the formalisms isw , d , ssa , differ from each other by the way the variable beta is treated , otherwise the @xmath1 equation being the same , the transition probabilities produced by the three approaches exhibit similar agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the ssa method produces very good agreement with the experimental energies for @xmath166os , @xmath3nd and @xmath171hf .",
    "table v shows that these nuclei have the largest deformations and moreover for the first two nuclei the ratio @xmath172 has the values 3.08 and 3.11 respectively , which deviate most from the x(5 ) value .",
    "the quoted ratio for @xmath3nd is 2.93 which is close to the x(5 ) value but its deformation is the largest one .",
    "the sextic potential for the @xmath0 assures a more realistic description of the excited states where the the excitation of the beta degree of freedom is important .",
    "this is best seen in the excellent agreement of the calculated excitation energies in the beta and gamma bands with the corresponding experimental data .",

    "<S> the eigenvalue equation associated to the bohr - mottelson hamiltonian is considered in the intrinsic reference frame and amended by replacing the harmonic oscillator potential in the @xmath0 variable with a sextic oscillator potential with centrifugal barrier plus a periodic potential for the @xmath1 variable . </S>",
    "<S> after the separation of variables , the @xmath0 equation is quasi - exactly solved , while the solutions for the @xmath1 equation are just the angular spheroidal functions . </S>",
    "<S> an anharmonic transition operator is used to determine the reduced e2 transition probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is conventionally called the sextic and spheroidal approach ( ssa ) and applied for several x(5 ) candidate nuclei : @xmath2os , @xmath3nd , @xmath4w , @xmath5dy , @xmath6hf . </S>",
    "<S> the ssa predictions are in good agreement with the experimental data of the mentioned nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison of the ssa results with those yielded by other models , such as x(5 ) @xcite , infinite square well ( isw ) @xcite , and davidson ( d ) like potential @xcite for the @xmath0 , otherwise keeping the spheroidal functions for the @xmath1 , and the coherent state model ( csm ) @xcite respectively , suggests that ssa represents a good approach to describe nuclei achieving the critical point of the u(5)@xmath7su(3 ) shape phase transition . </S>"
