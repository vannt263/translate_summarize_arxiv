    "the `` holy grail '' of computational many - body theory is to overcome the so - called `` exponential wall , '' i.e. , the exponentially increasing numerical effort as a function of the particle number to solve the many - body schrdinger equation @xcite .",
    "it is an obvious idea that one should try to replace the high - dimensional many - body wavefunction by some simpler , lower - dimensional quantity , and then derive equations governing this quantity because the `` many - electron wavefunction tells us more than we need to know '' @xcite .",
    "reduced density matrices ( rdm ) appear to be most suitable for that purpose .",
    "in fact , extensive research has been devoted to the properties and applications of rdm , starting with the classic work by lwdin @xcite , already early summarized in @xcite , and meanwhile covered in books and reviews @xcite , and excellent thesis works @xcite .    for systems with two - body interactions ,",
    "any observable can be _ explicitly _ written down in terms of the two - body reduced density matrix ( 2rdm ) .",
    "the hohenberg - kohn theorem @xcite of density functional theory ( dft ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) even ensures that any observable ( of a system governed by a hamiltonian with a scalar , local , external potential ) is _ in principle _ a functional of the single - particle density , i.e. , the diagonal of the ( spin - integrated ) one - body reduced density matrix ( 1rdm ) .",
    "however , these functionals are not known for all observables of interest so that approximations have to be made in practice .",
    "quite reasonably , it seems that the more reduced the quantity employed is , the more approximations have to be made in the governing equations ( such as the intricate exchange - correlation ( xc ) potential in the kohn - sham scheme @xcite ) , and for the observables .",
    "employing the 1rdm as the basic `` variable '' instead of the single - particle density brings us to reduced density matrix functional theory ( rdmft ) @xcite . in rdmft , the bogoliubov - born - green - kirkwood - yvon chain of equations needs to be truncated by a ( sufficiently accurate ) approximation of the 2rdm as a functional of the 1rdm . in the simplest form , this leads just to the hartree - fock ( hf ) equations .",
    "expressions for the 2rdm beyond hf have been devised and applied ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , although relatively few compared to the abundant literature on xc potentials in dft .",
    "approaches using directly the 2rdm as the basic variable have been proposed and applied as well @xcite .",
    "a naive minimization of the energy as a functional of the 2rdm will , however , yield too low energy values , as not all two - body density matrices ( 2 dm ) originate from an @xmath0-electron state .",
    "recent progress in the solution of this so - called @xmath0-representability problem has been made by formulating a hierarchy of conditions the 2 dm has to fulfill ( without resorting to higher - order rdm ) @xcite .",
    "it is computationally beneficial to expand the 1rdm and 2rdm in 1rdm eigenfunctions , the so - called natural orbitals ( no ) @xcite , as they form the best possible basis set ( in a well - defined mathematical sense ; see , e.g. , @xcite for details ) .",
    "the resulting equations for these no form a set of coupled , nonlinear schrdinger - like equations @xcite , as in configuration interaction calculations .",
    "the eigenvalue of the 1rdm to which a no belongs can be interpreted as its occupation number ( ocn ) . unlike in , e.g. , hartree - fock , these ocn are , in general , fractional @xmath10,1[$ ] in correlated fermionic systems ( unless they are `` pinned '' to @xmath2 or @xmath3 @xcite ) .    in this work",
    ", we investigate whether no can be efficiently employed to describe the correlated _ dynamics _ of a two - electron spin - singlet system in an external , driving field such as that of a laser .",
    "of course , the study of the _ structure _ of correlated two - electron systems has a long history that started soon after the `` invention '' of quantum mechanics . in view of a no description",
    "it has been analyzed by lwdin and shull in 1956 @xcite .",
    "the two - electron spin - singlet ground state wavefunction has an exceptionally simple structure when expanded in no , as the coefficient matrix turns out to be diagonal .",
    "this means that the ground state 2 dm needs not to be approximated in terms of the no but is known exactly in the two - electron case .",
    "one may think that the two - electron case is a bit ( too ) trivial to test a novel time - dependent _ many_-body method . however , this is not the case .",
    "while electronic structure calculations are difficult enough , time - dependent quantum dynamics beyond linear response with non - perturbative drivers is by far more challenging .",
    "in fact , from a computational point of view it is orders of magnitude more demanding because on top of the ground state problem one , subsequently , needs to propagate the system for typically @xmath4@xmath5 time steps on numerical grids typically a @xmath6@xmath4 times larger than that for the ground state .",
    "it is thus even more important to develop efficient numerical methods capable of describing such strongly driven quantum dynamics .",
    "time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) @xcite works well in many cases but fails ( with known and practicable adiabatic xc - potentials ) whenever the processes to be described rely on strong correlation or involve resonant interaction @xcite .",
    "as the correlation energy ( relative to the total energy ) typically increases as the number of electrons decreases ( down to two ) , it is the _",
    "few_-body correlated electron dynamics that serve as `` worst case '' benchmarks for methods beyond tddft with adiabatic xc potentials .",
    "for instance , autoionization in strong laser fields is currently investigated experimentally @xcite and particularly challenging for theory because it involves multiply - excited states .",
    "as multiply excited states are absent in tddft using adiabatic xc potentials @xcite it serves as an ideal testing ground for novel _ ab initio _ methods going beyond `` standard '' tddft .",
    "an algorithm for propagating no and ocn for two coupled nonlinear oscillators has been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the general equations of motion ( eom ) for the no and their ocn have been derived in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the volume of published work on _ time - dependent _ density matrix functional theory ( tddmft ) is still very limited .",
    "different adiabatic approximations to tddmft have been derived and applied to molecules @xcite and a two - site hubbard model @xcite , respectively .",
    "exact time - dependent no occupations have been investigated @xcite using the same numerically exactly solvable model atom employed in the current work .",
    "it was found that common approximations for the 2rdm functional render the ocn constant , which is incorrect for , e.g. , atoms in strong laser pulses or resonant interactions @xcite . a semi - classical approach to propagate the 1rdm that allows for changing ocn has been proposed in @xcite and applied to moshinsky s two - electron model atom @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theo ] we review the basic density matrix and no theory for the two - electron case and introduce renormalized no ( rno ) , which allow to unify the eom for the ocn and the no .",

    "<S> favorably scaling numerical time - dependent many - electron techniques such as time - dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) with adiabatic exchange - correlation potentials typically fail in capturing highly correlated electron dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> we propose a method based on natural orbitals , i.e. , the eigenfunctions of the one - body reduced density matrix , that is almost as inexpensive numerically as adiabatic tddft , but which is capable of describing correlated phenomena such as doubly excited states , autoionization , fano profiles in the photoelectron spectra , and strong - field ionization in general . </S>",
    "<S> equations of motion ( eom ) for natural orbitals and their occupation numbers have been derived earlier . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by using renormalized natural orbitals ( rno ) both can be combined into one equation governed by a hermitian effective hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> we specialize on the two - electron spin - singlet system , known as being a `` worst case '' testing ground for tddft , and employ the widely used , numerically exactly solvable , one - dimensional helium model atom ( in a laser field ) to benchmark our approach . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the full , nonlinear eom for the rno is plagued by instabilities , and resorting to linear response is not an option for the ultimate goal to study nonperturbative dynamics in intense laser fields . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore make two rather bold approximations : we employ the initial - state-``frozen '' effective rno hamiltonian for the time - propagation and truncate the number of rno to only two per spin . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , it turns out that even with these strong approximations we obtain a highly accurate ground state , reproduce doubly - excited states , and autoionization .    </S>",
