    "a leading approach to quantum information processing is via linear - optical quantum computing ( loqc ) , first proposed in 2001 by knill , laflamme and milburn @xcite .",
    "major progress has been made both on the theoretical and experimental fronts towards implementation of loqc .",
    "modifications have been proposed that greatly reduce the overhead costs @xcite , a quantum error correction protocol has been introduced @xcite , and experimental implementation of primary gates has been demonstrated @xcite .    in spite of this progress ,",
    "practical loqc is still out of reach .",
    "many of the difficulties arise because the single - photon sources required for loqc , as well as computational circuits themselves , suffer from losses .",
    "although a certain degree of tolerance to losses does exist in some loqc schemes @xcite , the efficiency of existing single - photon sources @xcite as well as the quality of individual circuit elements and waveguides are far below the required minima .    under these circumstances it appears beneficial to develop a procedure that would reverse the effect of losses , perhaps at a cost of introducing extra resources",
    ". it would be useful , for example , to employ the outputs of @xmath0 imperfect single - photon sources to obtain @xmath1 single - photon sources of improved quantum efficiency .",
    "accomplishing this task would be straightforward if nonlinear - optical interactions with single photons were readily available : for example , one could employ non - demolition photon number measurements to select only those modes that contain photons .",
    "however , achieving such interactions is extremely technically challenging @xcite , whereas linear - optical ( lo ) processing is easily achieved in the laboratory .",
    "it is therefore important to investigate whether elimination of losses is possible under lo processing . under this processing",
    "we understand arbitrary interferometric transformations and conditioning on results of arbitrary _ destructive _ measurements on some of the optical modes involved .",
    "the efforts to construct such a scheme began in 2004 , mostly ending with various no - go results @xcite .",
    "the most general result to date was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work",
    ", we quantified the _ efficiency _ of a quantum optical state by the amount of loss that state might have experienced .",
    "we then proved that the efficiency in any single - mode optical state obtained through lo processing can not exceed the quantum efficiency of the best available single - mode input @xcite .",
    "however , those previous results had limited application to multimode states . first , as we show below ,",
    "extending the definition of the efficiency of a quantum state to the multimode case is not straightforward , particularly when the loss has been  mixed \" among the modes by interferometric transformations .",
    "second , our earlier results do not provide any information on how the efficiencies can be distributed among the output modes , aside from the general upper bound mentioned above .",
    "for example , they leave open the possibility of a `` catalytic '' scheme , in which some high - efficiency single photons are used to obtain additional high - efficiency single photons .    in the present work",
    "we generalize our study of the dynamics of optical losses to the multimode case .",
    "we introduce the notion of quantum efficiency of a ( possibly entangled ) multimode state which quantifies the amount of loss this state may have experienced .",
    "we show that this efficiency can not increase under lo processing .",
    "that is , any loss that has occurred at the input can neither be removed nor redistributed so as to improve the efficiency in some of the modes at the expense of lower - efficiency modes .",
    "this means that there is a majorization relation between the efficiencies at the input and the output .",
    "the lo processing can act to average the efficiencies , but not to concentrate them .",
    "this rules out , in particular , any possibility of catalytic efficiency improvement .",
    "before describing multimode measures of efficiency , we discuss the properties and relationships for single - mode measures of efficiency that have been previously proposed . usually efficiency is used to describe a process for producing a state .",
    "however , it is also convenient to regard efficiency as a measure on the state itself , regardless of the process used to produce it @xcite .",
    "specifically , ref .",
    "@xcite uses the efficiency to quantify _ the maximum amount of loss an optical mode carrying the given state might have previously experienced _ :",
    "@xmath2 where @xmath3 is a loss channel with transmissivity @xmath4 .",
    "that is , one considers all hypothetical methods of producing the given state @xmath5 via loss from some valid initial quantum state @xmath6 .",
    "we emphasize that the loss is just a way of mathematically quantifying the efficiency of the state .",
    "it is not necessary that the state were created by such a process .",
    "the efficiency is a measure on the state , and should not be regarded as an intrinsic feature of the mode .",
    "let us study a few examples . ideally , single photon sources would produce a single photon state @xmath7 on demand . in practice ,",
    "such sources may with some probability fail to produce a photon , and there is no way to detect this failure without destructive measurement .",
    "therefore the state produced by a generic single photon source may be approximated as @xmath8 here the quantity @xmath4 is commonly referred to as the efficiency of the single photon source . in the context of our definition , state can be obtained from the single - photon state by transmitting a ( perfect ) single photon through a loss channel with transmissivity @xmath4 , and hence its efficiency equals @xmath4 . in this way ,",
    "the efficiency of state according to our new definition is consistent with the traditional definition of the efficiency of a single - photon source .",
    "coherent states have efficiency exactly equal to zero , regardless of their amplitude .",
    "this is because coherent states remain coherent states under loss .",
    "a coherent state of amplitude @xmath9 can be obtained from one of amplitude @xmath10 under a loss channel of transmissivity @xmath4 .",
    "although one can not take @xmath11 ( because complete loss always results in the vacuum state ) , possible values of @xmath4 form an open set with zero infimum .    on the other hand , any pure state _",
    "other _ than a coherent state ( or the vacuum state ) must have efficiency 1 .",
    "this is because a state under loss is a mixture of the original state , and the state with different numbers of photons lost .",
    "that is , a pure state @xmath12 becomes a mixture of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and so forth",
    ". the only way in which the state after loss can remain pure is if @xmath15 .",
    "the only states for which this is true are eigenstates of the annihilation operator ; i.e.  coherent states .    determining the efficiency of a known single - mode state is a straightforward computational task .",
    "the loss channel @xmath3 corresponds to a linear transformation known as the generalized bernoulli transformation .",
    "provided the state @xmath5 can be obtained via loss channel @xmath3 from some initial operator , we can define the inverse map @xmath16 , which can be calculated as in ref .",
    "therefore , we need to find the infimum of the values of @xmath4 such that the inverse bernoulli mapping @xmath17 exists and yields a valid quantum state , i.e.  can be represented by a positive semidefinite density matrix .",
    "a further interesting feature of a state s efficiency is that it equals zero if and only if the state is classical , i.e.  it can be written as a statistical mixture of coherent states , or , equivalently , its glauber - sudarshan @xmath18 function has the properties of a probability density . as discussed above , any coherent state",
    "has efficiency zero , and hence so does any statistical mixture of coherent states . to prove the converse ,",
    "let us suppose there exists a nonclassical state @xmath5 such that @xmath19 .",
    "let @xmath20 denote the fourier transform of this state s @xmath18 function @xmath21 over the phase space . according to bochner s theorem @xcite , because @xmath21 is not a probability density , there exist two sets of @xmath22 complex numbers @xmath23 and @xmath24 , such that @xmath25    because @xmath19 , for any @xmath26 there exists state @xmath6 such that @xmath27 is obtained from @xmath6 by means of attenuation by factor @xmath4 . because attenuation corresponds to  shrinkage \" of the @xmath18 function in the phase space @xcite , we have @xmath28 and hence @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "by choosing @xmath4 close to zero , the set of arguments of function @xmath31 in the above equation can be upper bounded by an arbitrarily small value @xmath32 .",
    "now recall that the husimi @xmath33 function of any quantum state must be non - negative .",
    "this means that the fourier transform @xmath34 of the @xmath33 function of state @xmath6 must obey @xmath35 but the @xmath33 function is obtained from the @xmath18 function by convolving the latter with a gaussian , @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "this means that the fourier transforms of these functions are connected by multiplication , @xmath37 by choosing @xmath4 close to zero , one can make the factor @xmath38 arbitrarily close to 1 within radius @xmath32 .",
    "accordingly , the left - hand sides of eqs .   and are equal in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "we arrive at a contradiction , which means that any nonclassical state @xmath27 must have a finite efficiency @xmath40 .",
    "let us now generalize the notion of efficiency to an optical state carried by multiple modes .",
    "a direct generalization can be obtained by assuming that each mode has propagated through its own loss channel , and taking the sum of the transmissivities : @xmath41 the notation @xmath42 indicates the elements of the vector @xmath43 sorted in non - increasing order .",
    "the value of @xmath44 can be less than the number of modes constituting state @xmath5 . in this way",
    ", the efficiency is defined not only for the entire state , but also for a subset of @xmath44 modes with the lowest losses .",
    "this extension facilitates comparison of efficiencies of states with different number of modes .",
    "a drawback of this definition is that it does not adequately take account of loss that has been mixed between modes .",
    "for example , consider two polarization modes carrying a single - photon qubit in the state @xmath45 .",
    "the efficiency of the state in the horizontally polarized mode is 1 , and that in the vertically polarized mode 0 , so @xmath46 . on the other hand , writing the same state in terms of diagonal polarization modes , we find @xmath47",
    ". this state can not be obtained by independent loss in the two modes , and would have a different efficiency , @xmath48 , even though its utility for quantum information processing is exactly the same as that of @xmath49 .    an alternative approach to quantifying",
    "the efficiency is to treat each mode separately , and calculate the sum of single - mode efficiencies for @xmath44 highest - efficiency modes : @xmath50 this definition is also problematic .",
    "first , similarly to the d - efficiency @xcite , it depends on the choice of the mode basis . for the example above , @xmath51 , but @xmath52 .",
    "second , it may underestimate the efficiency in many cases . for example , the s - efficiency of the state @xmath53 equals @xmath54 , and can be very small . on the other hand , conditioning on detection of a photon in one of the modes of @xmath55 results in a perfect single photon in the other mode , as is the case with producing heralded single photons via parametric down - conversion .",
    "state @xmath55 is thus much more useful than , for example , single - mode state @xmath56 , which has the same s - efficiency but can not be processed to produce a high - quality single photon .",
    "we aim to provide a definition of efficiency that would be invariant with respect to transformation of modes and adequately reflect the state s value for quantum information purposes . to this end",
    "we modify the definition @xmath57 by including an optimization over interferometers .",
    "that is , we consider simultaneous loss channels on each of the modes @xmath58 , followed by an arbitrary interferometer @xmath59 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : int1](a ) .",
    "the efficiency is then the sum of the @xmath44 largest values of @xmath60 : @xmath61    an important property of the u - efficiency is its invariance with respect to interferometric transformation of modes .",
    "indeed , if state @xmath62 can be obtained from state @xmath5 by applying interferometric transformation @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 , and we have @xmath65 in the context of eq .",
    "( [ eq : kef ] ) , we also have @xmath66 . but",
    "transformation @xmath67 can be treated as a single interferometer , which means that @xmath68 .",
    "but because interferometric transformations are reversible , we also have @xmath69 and hence @xmath70 .",
    "similar to the case for the efficiency @xmath71 , the u - efficiency can be calculated via inverting the channel . in finite dimension",
    ", the channel given by the loss followed by the unitary operation @xmath59 may be represented by a matrix , which may be inverted to find @xmath6 .",
    "the efficiency can then be found by a minimization over @xmath43 and @xmath59 such that @xmath6 is a valid quantum state .",
    "for the other two efficiencies , the calculation is simpler .",
    "for the d - efficiency , one only needs to minimize over @xmath43 , and for the s - efficiency one can just determine the single - mode efficiencies for the reduced density matrices in the individual modes .",
    "let us evaluate the multimode efficiency of the example states studied above .",
    "state @xmath49 is a tensor product and has @xmath72 .",
    "as we show below , the d- , s- , and u - efficiencies coincide for tensor product states , so we also have @xmath73 . since the u - efficiency is invariant under interferometric transformations , state @xmath74 has the same u - efficiency .",
    "analyzing each of the modes of state @xmath74 on its own , we find them to carry the state @xmath75/2 , so @xmath52 and @xmath76 . for state @xmath55 , both the u- and d - efficiencies equal 2",
    "this is because , even if subjected to an interferometric transformation , it is a pure state that is not coherent , and hence can not be obtained by attenuating another state .",
    "in this section we show that it is impossible to increase the u - efficiency using lo processing .",
    "a general lo scheme is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : int1](b ) .",
    "the input state @xmath5 , carried by @xmath0 optical modes with annihilation operators @xmath77 , is passed through a general interferometer which performs a unitary operation @xmath78 on these mode operators .",
    "we retain @xmath79 of the output modes @xmath80 , and the remaining @xmath81 modes are subjected to a generalized destructive quantum measurement .",
    "we consider postselection on a particular result of this measurement , and determine the u - efficiency of the state @xmath82 carried by the remaining output modes .",
    "our goal is to prove that @xmath83 for any @xmath84 .    in accordance with definition , we model the state @xmath5 as being obtained from some initial state @xmath6 by combining each of its modes , @xmath85 , with vacuum @xmath86 on a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath87 [ fig .  [",
    "fig : int1](a ) ] : @xmath88 followed by interferometer @xmath59 .",
    "we assume that the settings are chosen such that , for some @xmath89 , @xmath90 the introduction of @xmath91 takes account of the possibility that there does not exist a setting which achieves the infimum .    because interferometers @xmath59 and @xmath78 are adjacent to each other , we can without loss of generality treat them as a single interferometer , corresponding to unitary transformation @xmath92 .",
    "the action of this interferometer can be written as @xmath93 we see that each vacuum mode contributes to each of the output modes , including those that are subjected to conditional measurements .",
    "these measurements may  compromise \" the vacuum contributions to the output state @xcite , so the output efficiency can not be calculated directly from the matrix elements @xmath94 .",
    "we address this issue by performing an rq decomposition on the matrix @xmath95 such that @xmath96 where @xmath33 is unitary and @xmath97 is an upper triangular matrix , so @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",

    "the subset @xmath103 of these modes does not contribute to the set of output modes @xmath104 that is subjected to measurement , and thus directly leads to the loss of efficiency in the output state .",
    "without loss of generality , we append another interferometer , @xmath105 , acting on the @xmath79 output modes . because the u - efficiency is independent of linear interferometers , this interferometer does not affect the u - efficiency at the output . to determine the interferometer to use",
