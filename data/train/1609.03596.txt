    "the inner and outer tensor products of irreducible characters of the symmetric groups ( or equivalently of schur functions ) have been of central interest in representation theory and algebraic combinatorics since the landmark papers of littlewood and richardson @xcite and murnaghan @xcite .",
    "more recently , these coefficients have provided the centrepiece of geometric complexity theory ( an approach that seeks to settle the @xmath0 versus @xmath1 problem @xcite ) and have been found to have deep connections with quantum information theory @xcite .",
    "the coefficients arising in the outer tensor product are the most well - understood . the littlewood ",

    "a classification of multiplicity - free outer tensor products was obtained by stembridge @xcite .",
    "this was extended to a classification of multiplicity - free skew characters by gutschwager @xcite , a result equivalent to the classification of multiplicity - free products of schubert classes obtained around the same time by thomas and yong @xcite .    by contrast , the coefficients arising in the inner tensor product are much less well - understood ; indeed , they have been described as ` perhaps the most challenging , deep and mysterious objects in algebraic combinatorics ' @xcite . the determination of these coefficients has been described by richard stanley as ` one of the main problems in the combinatorial representation theory of the symmetric group ' @xcite . while ` no satisfactory answer to this question is known ' @xcite there have , over many decades , been a number of contributions made towards computing special products ( such as those labelled by 2-line or hook partitions @xcite ) or the multiplicity of special constituents ( for example those with few homogenous components @xcite ) .    in 1999 , bessenrodt conjectured a classification of multiplicity - free kronecker products of irreducible characters of the symmetric groups . mainly using results of remmel , saxl and vallejo ,",
    "it was shown at that time that the products on the conjectured list were indeed multiplicity - free and the conjecture was verified by computer calculations for all @xmath2 .",
    "since then , multiplicity - free kronecker products have been studied in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we prove that the classification list is indeed complete for all  @xmath3 and hence confirm the conjecture , that is , we have the following result :    [ thm : classification ] let @xmath4 be partitions of @xmath3",
    ". then the kronecker product @xmath5\\cdot [ \\mu]$ ] of the irreducible characters @xmath5,[\\mu]$ ] of @xmath6 is multiplicity - free if and only if the partitions @xmath4 satisfy one of the following conditions ( up to conjugation of one or both of the partitions ) :    1 .",
    "one of the partitions is @xmath7 , and the other one is arbitrary ; 2 .",

    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : background ] , we recall the results concerning kronecker and littlewood  richardson coefficients which will be useful for the remainder of the paper , chief among these are dvir recursion and manivel s semigroup property .",

    "section  [ sec : warm - up ] serves as a gentle introduction to the techniques which will be used in sections  [ sec : rectangle ] , [ sec : fatty ] , and [ sec : finale ] ; here we consider tensor squares , products involving a hook , and products involving a 2-line partition . in section  [ sec : if1then2 ] , we show that if [ thm : classification ] has been proven to be true for all partitions of degree less than or equal to @xmath25 , then [ thm : classification - skew ] is also true for all skew - partitions of degree less than or equal to @xmath25 .",
