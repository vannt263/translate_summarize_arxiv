    "the experimental program on deeply bound pionic states has revived the interest on the interaction of pions with nuclei .",
    "recently the attention has focused on the charge exchange scattering length @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the fit to these data  @xcite suggests a large enhancement of @xmath1 in nuclei , as anticipated in ref .",
    "it is the purpose of this letter to investigate this question within a non - linear representation of the sigma model keeping the scalar degree of freedom .",
    "the advantage of this model is that it allows an explicit evaluation of the contribution of the nuclear pion gas in a way which satisfies the constraints imposed by chiral invariance . at the same time it keeps the extra degree of freedom associated with the scalar meson so as not to exhaust the physics only with pions .",
    "the quantity that we investigate is the charge exchange amplitude of a quasi - pion ( _ i.e. _ , on mass shell in the medium ) on a nucleon embedded in infinite nuclear matter .",
    "we will derive the in - medium correction to first order in the nucleon density .",
    "our emphasis is not so much on a comparison with data but rather on the derivation itself of the in - medium value for @xmath1 and on some important questions of principle arising in comparison with other theoretical works .",
    "our starting point is based on the linear sigma model but reformulated as in ref .",
    "@xcite . the original sigma field @xmath2 and",
    "pion fields @xmath3 are eliminated in favor of a chiral invariant scalar field , @xmath4 , and a new pion field @xmath5 according to : @xmath6~.\\ ] ] as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fluctuating scalar field @xmath7 , which physically describes the fluctuations of the radius of the chiral circle around its vacuum value @xmath8 , can be identified with the sigma meson of relativistic theories of the walecka type .",
    "the function @xmath9 selects the particular realization of the model . changing @xmath10 amounts to a redefinition of the pion field , which should not affect physics . in the following we keep @xmath11 arbitrary and check that the final results for physical observables do not depend on this parameter .",
    "the lagrangian as given by eqs.(19 - 30 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite writes ( notice that the notations @xmath12 for the chiral invariant scalar field are now replaced by @xmath13 ) :    @xmath14    where we have defined ( with @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 this field transformation has the advantages of the non - linear realization but the radius of the chiral circle is not frozen and it keeps the degree of freedom associated with the scalar meson .",
    "the new pion field couples derivatively ( to both the nucleon and the scalar field ) in such a way that the low - energy theorems are satisfied without need of cancellations . as for the symmetry breaking piece we have the following expression in terms of the new variables : @xmath17 in order to reproduce the experimental value of the isoscalar scattering length it is necessary , as in chiral perturbation theory , to introduce additional chiral invariant pieces contributing to order @xmath18 : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is the four - velocity of the nucleon .",
    "these @xmath22 and @xmath23 parameters have to be empirically determined .",
    "finally the introduction of a form factor at the p - wave @xmath24 vertex allows the contact with the standard pion - nucleon and pion - nucleus phenomenology . in this model",
    "the pion - nucleon sigma term , @xmath25 , receives two contributions , one from the scalar field of the nucleon and one from its pion cloud  : @xmath26 the scalar contribution is given by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the scalar meson - nucleon coupling constant .",
    "in the nuclear medium the relative amount of restoration is linked to the mean scalar field @xmath29 . to",
    "leading order in density it is given by  : @xmath30 the pion cloud contribution ( with its important @xmath31 piece ) has been explicitly calculated with a model form factor .",
    "the resulting value is @xmath32 25 mev @xcite , about half of the total value . in order to link it to the chiral perturbation",
    "result we expand it in orders of the pion mass : @xmath33 the coefficient @xmath34 depends on the model ( _ i.e. _ , on the form factor ) .",
    "it is related to the coefficient @xmath35 of chiral perturbation theory by @xmath36 .",
    "the leading non analytical contribution , @xmath37 , is instead given by chiral symmetry alone : @xmath38 its numerical value is @xmath39  mev , to be compared with the value of the full sigma term which is @xmath40  mev .",
    "we stress that such a model pion cloud calculation has been successfully used to extrapolate lattice data into the low quark mass , _",
    "i.e. _ , to the low pion mass sector @xcite . introducing the scalar density of nuclear pions , @xmath41 , the relative amount of restoration from the pion cloud",
    "is given to leading order in density by : @xmath42 we now turn to the s - wave isoscalar pion self - energy for pions of zero three - momentum . to linear order in density",
    "it is simply given by the vacuum @xmath0 @xmath43-matrix multiplied by the density .",
    "the various contributions are depicted in fig .",
    "[ piself ] . the pion loop contribution ( fig .",
    "1a ) , including vertex corrections not shown in fig .",
    "[ piself]a , is derived in refs .",
    "it involves the pionic piece of the sigma term .",
    "as for the scalar exchange contribution ( fig .",
    "1b ) it is related to the scalar piece of the sigma term . fig .",
    "1c is immediately obtained from the lagrangian given in eq .",
    "( [ extra ] ) and fig .",
    "1d is the born term contribution with pseudo - vector coupling .",
    "the final result to leading order in density reads : @xmath44 note that the pion self - energy is not directly an observable and it depends on the representation through the @xmath45 factor : @xmath46",
    "the energy dependence of the pion self - energy implies a wave - function renormalization of the in - medium pion , as noticed in several works @xcite .",
    "the particular importance of the energy dependence for the interpretation of the deeply bound pionic states has recently been emphasized in ref .",
    "the pion propagator has the form @xmath47 . from the expression for the self - energy , eq .",
    "( [ pimodel ] ) , we obtain for the residue  : @xmath48 the value of the isoscalar scattering length , @xmath49 , provides a relation between the different parameters entering this expression . for the nucleon it is given by : @xmath50 according to recent accurate data @xcite , this value is compatible with zero .",
    "this near - vanishing of @xmath49 ( believed to be fortuitous ) translates into the following expression for the residue : @xmath51    the residue provides a first source for the renormalization of the isovector scattering length @xmath1 . notice that if the pion loop correction ( the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ resmodel ] ) ) is ignored one recovers the original proposal of ref .",
    ". however this description would be incomplete since , as previously discussed , the pion cloud piece of the sigma term is certainly not negligible .",
    "in addition a description of the in - medium modification with the only influence of the residue is clearly unsatisfactory since the result then depends on the representation .",
    "indeed there is another source of renormalization , which to our knowledge has previously been ignored .",
    "it arises from the pion loop correction of the isovector pion - nucleon amplitude , inherent to the non - linear realization . the isovector piece ( weinberg - tomozawa ) of the chiral lagrangian is given by : @xmath52 where the second expression arises from an expansion to fourth order in the pion field .",
    "after the appropriate isospin averaging , one obtains an effective weinberg - tomozawa lagrangian which is modified in the medium by one - pion loop correction ( see fig .",
    "[ piwt ] ) : @xmath53    the isospin - antisymmetric amplitude is proportional to the pion energy @xmath54 . in the vacuum @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . for the quasi - particle in the medium",
    "the energy is the pion effective mass @xmath57 .",
    "since we take @xmath49 to be zero , to first order in the density the effective and bare pion masses are equal .",
    "according to the previous discussion the in - medium renormalization of @xmath1 is then  : @xmath58 which gives  : @xmath59 notice that once the two influences are taken into account the representation dependence has disappeared , an important consistency check of our result .",
    "coming to a numerical evaluation , the parameters of the model , in particular the sigma mass , can be fixed by a simultaneous fit to the saturation curve and to pion - pion phase shifts @xcite .",
    "a typical value is @xmath60  mev , yielding @xmath61  mev .",
    "taking also @xmath62  mev , we have  : @xmath63 this leads to the estimate : @xmath64 even if the coefficient @xmath65 may be slightly changed if the relative weight between the pion cloud and the scalar contribution to the sigma term is changed , the enhancement is more moderate than the original proposal @xcite which ignores the pion loop correction ( in that case the coefficient is of the order of @xmath66 depending on the precise value of the sigma term ) . in our case",
    "this pion loop correction partly cancels the effect of the pion - nucleon sigma term .",
    "the pion - self - energy has been calculated using a chiral perturbation approach . to leading order in density",
    ", it reads @xcite : @xmath67 one can make a one - to - one correspondence between this chipt result and the result obtained in our model ( eq .  [ pimodel ] ) .",
    "the first term ( @xmath25 ) and the third term ( born term ) are identical in both expressions of the self - energy .",
    "the fourth terms in both expressions are also equivalent since the comparison between the two just defines the quantity @xmath68 in the particular model that we use . as for the representation",
    "dependent coefficient @xmath69 which appears in the last term of eq .",
    "[ pichipt ] , it has to be be identified with @xmath70 .",
    "however there is an essential difference both at the conceptual and quantitative levels .",
    "the second term and the fifth one ( representation dependent term ) involve the lnac piece of the pion loop , at variance with the model calculation where the full pion loop appears .",
    "we will return later to this difference and we study for the moment the consequences for the @xmath1 parameter . following the same steps as in section iii , with the constraint that the isoscalar scattering length vanishes , we obtain for the residue : @xmath71 taking , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath72 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath73 ) , the influence of the residue on the @xmath1 parameter becomes  : @xmath74 which yields a larger enhancement than our model calculation .",
    "however this result is not representation independent .",
    "the pion - loop correction in the weinberg - tomozawa amplitude which is not taken into account in the chipt calculation should be added . if this is done in a consistent way one should retain only the lnac piece of the pion loop in order to reach the representation independent following result : @xmath75 this is numerically very close to what is obtained from the prescription used in ref .",
    "@xcite but still difficult to reconcile with our model result .",
    "the crucial difference is the fact that , in our model , the pion loop always appears as a whole and the lnac can never appear as an isolated piece . in other words",
    "the model involves the combination @xmath76 rather than @xmath77 alone .",
    "the two quantities are of comparable magnitude but of opposite signs .",
    "the difference between the two approaches is associated with different off - mass shell behavior of the @xmath0 amplitude . as a further test of our method , in the pcac representation in which the relation @xmath78 holds",
    ", the soft pion amplitude ( obtained by taking @xmath79 ) should be proportional to @xmath25 . in order to obtain the pcac representation it is sufficient to send",
    "the sigma mass to infinity ( the sigma term then has only the pionic contribution ) and to take @xmath80 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath81 ) . in that case one",
    "recovers at the soft pion point the venerable low - energy theorem since : @xmath82 instead with the prescription of eq .",
    "( [ pichipt ] ) for the chipt off - shell amplitude , one gets : @xmath83 the two terms on the r.h.s . being negative can not cooperate to reproduce the positive sigma term , in conflict with the soft pion theorem .",
    "we have studied the in - medium renormalization of the isovector amplitude in the linear sigma model .",
    "we use it in a non - linearized representation in which the radius of the chiral circle is not frozen , which preserves the sigma degree of freedom . in this approach",
    "the nucleon sigma commutator is built of a scalar meson exchange with the condensate and a two - pion exchange one , the pion cloud contribution .",
    "we find , as in our previous works on other in - medium quantities , that the independence on the representation is achieved through a combination of two effects : i ) the residue of the pion propagator arising from the energy dependence of the pion self - energy , ii ) the influence of the pion loops on the weinberg - tomozawa amplitude ( which must also apply to the chiral perturbation approach of refs .",
    "@xcite so as to make it independent on the representation ) .",
    "our description results in a more moderate renormalization of @xmath1 : at normal nuclear density , an enhancement by 18% , which is less than the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite or the one which can be derived from the results of ref.@xcite .",
    "the difference between our model and the chipt approaches lies in the role of the pion loops .",
    "our treatment for these is identical to the one employed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the pion gas in a heat bath .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , when taken in the chiral limit , reproduce the chiral perturbation expansion up to second order .",
    "the only difference between the present calculation and the description of the pion gas in a heat bath amounts to the ( physically natural ) replacement of the scalar density of thermally excited pions by that of the nuclear pions , a positive quantity . on the contrary , in the chiral approach of refs .",
    "@xcite only the leading non - analytical term appears in the self - energy ( beyond what is implicitly contained in the nucleon sigma commutator ) . since @xmath77 is negative and comparatively large , the numerical consequences which follow explain the difference in the renormalization factor . it will be interesting to exactly clarify why , in the chiral approach , @xmath77 , which is in fact a piece of the pion density , dissociates from the rest , while the whole pion density ( with its simple physical interpretation ) naturally enters in our approach .",
    "the nucleon size , which is crucial in any model evaluation of the nuclear pion loop , introduces a scale which does not seem to be fully incorporated in this chipt approach .",
    "the model calculations of the pion loop which explicitly takes into account the nucleon size ( _ i.e. _ , in practice the form factor ) have proven their relevance and usefulness .",
    "for instance they give an excellent fit to the quark mass dependence of the lattice results allowing a convincing extrapolation to the physical mass region @xcite .",
    "the actual fits of recent data on deeply bound pionic states suggest a larger enhancement of @xmath1 than our prediction @xcite . in this context",
    "we want to point out that the comparison between our result and the the fit to pionic atoms data is not direct .",
    "first of all we consider only strong interactions and ignore effects due to coulomb forces , while these are crucial to bind the pion within the pionic atoms on which the fit is based . they are discussed in ref .",
    "moreover not all renormalization effects are included in our approach .",
    "for instance , we did not consider pion rescattering on two correlated nucleons .",
    "it is known to provide a sizeable part of the repulsive isospin - symmetric potential . since it is not explicitly introduced in the fits to data for the charge exchange potential",
    ", it has to be included as a medium renormalization of @xmath1 .",
    "this effect can be evaluated from the formulae given in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the fermi momentum of the nucleons . at normal density , it amounts to a decrease of @xmath1 by @xmath86 , _",
    "i.e. _ , it does not help to explain a larger enhancement .",
    "it would be interesting to attempt to fit the pionic atom data with a more moderate enhancement of the @xmath1 parameter .",
    "if the larger enhancement is confirmed it would be an incentive to push the investigations further .",
    "one might consider the influence of higher order effects in the density , which could upset the nearly total cancellations present in the isospin symmetric scattering length .",
    "for instance , the pionic piece of the sigma commutator should be replaced by the fully dressed one in which the pion line is dressed by nucleon - hole and @xmath31-hole excitations screened by short range correlations . at normal nuclear density",
    "the effect leads to a moderate enhancement ( of the order of 25% ) of @xmath41  @xcite .",
    "the many - body effects in the other contributions should be similarly investigated , including those concerning the phenomenological parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which would require a model for these quantities .",
    "the question of the in - medium modification of the charge exchange @xmath0 amplitude first raised by weise is indeed quite challenging on the theoretical side as well as on the experimental one .",
    "it is likely that more physics remains to be understood in this problem .",
