    "in the standard theoretical description of galaxy formation , galaxies form by the dissipation of the baryonic component within collisionless dark matter halos ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . when a dark matter halo enters the virial radius of a more massive halo , it is subjected to tidal stripping and potentially to disruption .",
    "nonetheless , high resolution n - body simulations have indicated that massive halos retain a substantial amount of substructure @xcite , consisting of bound dark matter clumps orbiting within the potential of their host halo . evidently , such subhalos were themselves independent , self - contained halos in the past , before merging with a more massive halo . if sufficiently massive , these subhalos were sites of baryon dissipation and star formation in the past .",
    "there are many indications from studies of the statistical properties of how galaxies and substructures populate halos that galaxies in groups and clusters are in fact the observational counterparts of subhalos .",
    "for example , @xcite and @xcite show that the correlation functions of substructures in high resoution n - body simulations are in good agreement with the observed correlation functions of galaxies . on the theory side ,",
    "@xcite find that the distribution of subhalos in high resolution n - body simulations is similar to that of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) galaxies in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "subhalo abundance matching ( sham ) is a technique for assigning observable galaxy properties to a halo / subhalo population in an n - body simulation .",
    "it is based on assuming a monotonic relationship between observable properties of galaxies and dynamical properties of dark matter substructures . as subhalos that fall into the virial radius of more massive halos",
    "are subjected to stripping and tidal disruption , several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) contend that the properties of satellite galaxies should be better correlated with the properties of subhalos at the time of their accretion onto a more massive halo rather than their present day properties . by using the sham technique , with this accretion - epoch matching , @xcite match the observed luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering at a wide range of epochs , ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath16 . assuming a monotonic relationship between galaxy mass and halo mass and using the same sham technique , @xcite reproduce the observationally inferred relation between stellar mass and halo virial mass .",
    "@xcite use the abundance matching technique to match the observed relations between stellar mass and circular velocity and luminosity and circular velocity , and to match the estimated galaxy velocity function .    in this paper ,",
    "we investigate the effectiveness of subhalo abundance matching ( sham ) in cosmological sph simulations , where we know exactly the relation between the properties of galaxies and the masses of their parent halos and subhalos .",
    "we investigate the degree to which there is a direct correspondence between the properties of dark matter substructures in a dissipationless numerical simulation of a cosmological volume and condensed baryons in numerical simulations ( with the same initial conditions ) that include a dissipative component .",
    "we extend the similar study of @xcite in several ways .",
    "firstly , our simulation volume is more than ten times larger .",
    "secondly , one of our dissipative simulations includes ejective feedback in the form of momentum driven winds , which curtail star formation and produce a stellar mass function that is in better agreement with the observations .",
    "lastly and perhaps most importantly , we relate galaxy properties to the subhalo mass at the epoch of accretion rather than at the present time ( see comparison in  4 ) .",
    "we make a direct assessment of the effectiveness of sham as a method for assigning stellar mass , luminosity or star formation rate to subhalos and investigate the sources of its breakdown .",
    "our investigation offers insight into the physical mechanisms that shape galaxy masses and luminosities in these simulations , and it also has practical import . if the subhalo population in the purely gravitational simulation does indeed trace the observable properties of the galaxy population , it enables us to make observable predictions of quantities like the luminosity dependence of galaxy clustering based on computationally less expensive n - body simulations instead of hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "sham also offers a relatively inexpensive tool for creating artificial galaxy catalogues to support statistical analyses of large scale structure data sets .    in  2 , we describe our simulation , our methods for identifying halos , subhalos and galaxies , and the subhalo abundance matching scheme . in  3 , we investigate the relationship between the stellar masses , luminosities , and star formation rates of sph galaxies and dark matter substructures in our sph simulations to test some of the underlying assumptions of the subhalo abundance matching technique . in  4 , we investigate whether the sph galaxy population can be recovered from the subhalo population in our matched n - body simulation ; note that it is this comparison rather than the investigations in  3 that tests sham as it has been traditionally implemented .",
    "finally , in  5 , we summarise our results and discuss their implications .",
    "our simulations are performed using the gadget-2 code @xcite as modified by @xcite .",
    "gravitational forces are calculated using a combination of the particle mesh algorithm @xcite for large distances and the hierarchical tree algorithm @xcite for short distances .",
    "the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) algorithm is entropy and energy conserving and is based on @xcite .",
    "the details of the treatment of radiative cooling can be found in @xcite .",
    "gas can dissipate energy via compton cooling and radiative cooling , computed assuming a primordial gas composition and a background uv flux based on @xcite .",
    "the details of the treatment of star formation can be found in @xcite .",
    "briefly , each gas particle satisfying a temperature and density criterion is assigned a star formation rate , but the conversion of gaseous material to stellar material proceeds stochastically .",
    "the parameters for the star formation model are selected so as to match the @xmath4 relation between star formation rate and gas density @xcite .",
    "we adopt a @xmath17cdm cosmology ( inflationary cold dark matter with a cosmological constant ) with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 km s@xmath21mpc@xmath21=0.7 , @xmath22 , spectral index @xmath23 , and the amplitude of the mass fluctuations scaled to @xmath24 .",
    "these values are reasonably close to current estimates from the cosmic microwave background @xcite and large scale structure @xcite .",
    "we do not expect minor changes in the values of the cosmological parameters to affect our conclusions .",
    "we follow the evolution of @xmath25 dark - matter particles and @xmath25 gas particles , i.e. just under 50 million particles in total , in a comoving box that is 50@xmath26 mpc on each side , from @xmath27 to @xmath4 .",
    "the dark matter particle mass is 4.3 @xmath10 @xmath28 @xmath29 , and the sph particle mass is 9.1 @xmath10 @xmath30 @xmath29 .",
    "the gravitational force softening is a comoving 5@xmath26 kpc cubic spline , which is roughly equivalent to a plummer force softening of 3.5@xmath26 kpc .",
    "one of our simulations , sphw ( sph winds ) incorporates kinetic feedback through momentum driven winds as implemented by @xcite and @xcite where the details of the implementation can be found .",
    "briefly , wind velocity is proportional to the velocity dispersion of the galactic halo , and the ratio of the gas ejection rate to the star formation rate is inversely proportional to the velocity dispersion of the galactic halo .",
    "we also carry out a simulation with the same cosmological and numerical parameters as the sphw simulation , but without momentum driven winds , sphnw ( sph no winds ) .",
    "although no energy is kinetically imparted to sph particles , the sphnw simulation includes thermal feedback from supernovae ( see * ? ? ?",
    "however , since the surrounding gas is dense , the energy is radiated away before it can drive outflows or significantly suppress star formation .",
    "our sphnw and sphw simulations are analogous to the nw and vzw simulations of @xcite , who investigate the growth of galaxies by accretion and wind recycling and compare predicted mass functions to observations .",
    "our simulations are also used by @xcite , who investigate intergalactic dust extinction .",
    "in addition to the two sph simulations , we carry out a non - dissipative , purely gravitational , n - body simulation with identical cosmological and numerical parameters and the same initial positions and velocities of particles as the sph simulations , except that the dark matter particle mass is higher by a factor of @xmath31 to compensate for the gravitational effects of not including baryons .",
    "we refer to this n - body simulation as the dm ( dark matter only ) simulation .",
    "we identify dark matter haloes using a fof ( friends - of - friends ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the algorithm selects groups of particles in which each particle has at least one neighbour within a linking length .",
    "we assign a mass to the halos using a so ( spherical overdensity ) criterion , with the threshold density set to the virial overdensity in spherical collapse @xcite . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the mean interior overdensity with respect to the critical density of the universe is 94 .",
    "we set the centre of the group at the most bound fof particle and go out in radius until the mean density enclosed is equal to the virial density . while fof occasionally links multiple distinct concentrations together",
    ", most fof halos contain a distinct mass concentration ( see figures 1 and 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "to identify substructures within halos , we use the adaptahop @xcite code .",
    "the details of the algorithm can be found in @xcite , so we provide only a brief summary of it here .",
    "we calculate densities around each dark matter particle using an sph - like kernel estimator , with a cubic spline kernel containing 32 neighbours .",
    "we then partition the ensemble of particles into `` peak patches '' where a peak patch is a set of particles with the same local density maximum .",
    "the connectivity between peak patches is dictated by the saddle points in the density field .",
    "we identify subsets of particles in each peak patch with sph density larger than the density of the highest saddle point connecting it to a neighbouring peak patch .",
    "to select statistically significant substructures as opposed to random fluctuations in the density field , we require that the mean density of a substructure be 4@xmath32 above the sph density of the saddle point .",
    "the performance of adaptahop on a simulation similar to that here is illustrated in @xcite ( see their figure 1 ) .",
    "hydrodynamic cosmological simulations that incorporate cooling and star formation produce dense groups of baryons with sizes and masses comparable to the luminous regions of observed galaxies @xcite .",
    "we identify galaxies using the spline kernel interpolative denmax ( skid ) algorithm @xcite , which identifies gravitationally bound particles associated with a common density maximum .",
    "we refer to the groups of stars and cold gas thus identified as galaxies .",
    "the simulated galaxy population becomes substantially incomplete below our resolution threshold of @xmath1464 sph particles @xcite , which corresponds to a baryonic mass of 5.8 @xmath33 @xmath29 .",
    "although this threshold applies to the total baryonic mass ( stars plus cold , dense gas ) of galaxies , we adopt it as our threshold for stellar mass and ignore galaxies with lower stellar mass .    figure [ fig : sub0 ] compares the galaxy stellar mass function in the sphnw and sphw simulations at @xmath4 . in the sphnw simulation , there are 7,952 galaxies above our resolution threshold , corresponding to a space density of 0.064 @xmath34 mpc@xmath35 . in the sphw simulation",
    "there are only 2,264 galaxies above our resolution threshold , corresponding to a space density of 0.018 @xmath34 mpc@xmath35 because wind feedback pushes the stellar mass of many galaxies below the 64 m@xmath36 threshold .",
    "the two mass functions gradually converge towards higher masses , joining at @xmath37 @xmath38 10@xmath39 m@xmath40 , because wind feedback has less suppressing effect in larger systems since the amount of material ejected in this model scales inversely with circular velocity . @xcite",
    "discuss the comparison between the predicted stellar mass functions and observational estimates in some detail .",
    "roughly speaking , the sphw model reproduces observational estimates for @xmath37 @xmath41 10@xmath42 m@xmath40 , but it predicts excessive galaxy masses ( at a given space density ) for @xmath43 @xmath38 10@xmath39 m@xmath40 .",
    "subhalo abundance matching ( sham ) is a technique for assigning galaxies to simulated dark matter halos and subhalos .",
    "the essential assumptions are that all galaxies reside in identifiable dark matter substructures and that luminosity or stellar mass of a galaxy is monotonically related to the potential well depth of its host halo or subhalo .",
    "some implementations use the maximum of the circular velocity profile as the indicator of potential well depth , while others use halo or subhalo mass .",
    "the first clear formulations of sham as a systematic method appear in @xcite and @xcite , but these build on a number of previous studies that either test the underpinnings of sham or implicitly assume sham - like galaxy assignment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "n - body simulations produce subhalos that are located within the virial radius of so halos .",
    "the present mass of subhalos is a product of mass build up during the period when the halo evolves in isolation and tidal mass loss after it enters the virial radius of a more massive halo ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the stellar component , however , is at the bottom of the potential well and more tightly bound making it less likely to be affected by tidal forces .",
    "therefore , several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) argue that the properties of the stellar component should be more strongly correlated with the subhalo mass at the epoch of accretion rather than at @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite apply a global statistical correction to subhalo masses relative to halo masses ( as do @xcite ) , while @xcite explicitly identify subhalos at the epoch of accretion and use the maximum circular velocity at that epoch .",
    "our formulation here is similar to that of @xcite , though we use mass rather than circular velocity .",
    "specifically , we assume a monotonic relationship between stellar mass and halo mass and determine the form of this relation by solving the implicit equation @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the number densities of galaxies and halos , respectively , @xmath37 is the galaxy stellar mass threshold , and @xmath47 is the halo mass threshold chosen so that the number density of halos above it is equal to the number density of galaxies in the sample .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is defined as follows : @xmath49 where z@xmath50 is the epoch when a halo first enters the virial radius of a more massive halo .",
    "we also consider ( in  3.2 ) variants of this procedure in which we substitute r - band luminosity or instantaneous star formation rate for stellar mass in eq.(1 ) .    in  3",
    ", we use our sph simulations to test the degree to which galaxy stellar mass and luminosity are monotonic functions of halo / subhalo mass , as assumed in sham . for independent halos ,",
    "we set @xmath47 equal to the @xmath4 mass of so halos .",
    "we use the adaptahop code to identify subhalos hosting satellite galaxies above the resolution threshold at @xmath4 in our sph simulations .",
    "we then use their particle membership to identify their progenitor so halos at @xmath1 , whose mass we adopt as @xmath47 .",
    "we can identify a host subhalo for the vast majority of our galaxies at @xmath4 .",
    "however , for about one percent of galaxies we can not identify any associated substructure . in these cases , we use the galaxy s baryonic particles to trace its high redshift progenitors up to the epoch when it was the only galaxy in an so halo and adopt the mass of this so halo as @xmath47 . after matching ,",
    "we examine the correlations of galaxy properties with @xmath47 for both central and satellite systems , and we compare the stellar masses , luminosities , and ( at high redshift ) star formation rates that would be assigned by monotonic matching to the simulation values . of course",
    ", sham is usually applied to collisionless n - body simulations , not sph simulations , and the subhalo populations can differ even for the same initial conditions because of the dynamical effects of the dissipative baryons on the dark matter .    in  4 , we populate halos / subhalos in our dm - only simulation using sham , following a procedure akin to the one usually used to match simulated halos / subhalos to observed galaxies . for independent halos , we set @xmath47 equal to the @xmath4 mass of so halos .",
    "we identify subhalos using the adaptahop code and use their particle membership to identify their progenitor so halos at @xmath1 , whose mass we adopt as @xmath47 .",
    "we have checked that at @xmath1  , the relation between @xmath51 and @xmath47 is close to monotonic , so we would get similar results from using @xmath52 instead of @xmath47 . for comparison , we also implement a procedure that we refer to as shamz0 , where we set @xmath47 equal to the @xmath4 mass for both independent halos and subhalos identified in our n - body simulation .",
    "@xcite find differences in the performance of various halo finding algorithms in identifying substructures and accurately recovering their properties , particularly for subhalos containing fewer than 40 particles .",
    "since we trace the @xmath1  progenitors of @xmath4 substructures , our results are unlikely to be affected by random fluctuations in the density field of halos that may be spuriously identified as substructures .",
    "however , if subhalos hosting satellite galaxies that have merged with the central galaxy of the halo are identified as substructures , we would overestimate the halo occupation of massive halos .",
    "conversely , subhalos that fall into more massive halos and lose a substantial fraction of their mass due to tidal stripping may no longer be resolved in the simulation at @xmath4 even though they might survive and host satellite galaxies in a sufficiently high resolution calculation .",
    "the left column of figure [ fig : sub1 ] shows galaxy stellar mass plotted against halo mass in the sphnw simulation ( top ) and the sphw simulation ( bottom ) . for galaxies that are the central objects of their parent halos ( henceforth central galaxies ) , the halo mass , @xmath47 , on the horizontal axis , is the mass of the so halo in which the galaxy is located at @xmath4 . for galaxies that are not the central objects of their respective so halos ( henceforth satellite galaxies )",
    ", @xmath47 is the mass of the so halo in which the galaxy is located at @xmath1 , the last output epoch before its parent halo fell into the virial radius of a more massive halo ; @xmath1 values range between @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the black solid curve and red dotted curve show the median galaxy stellar mass in evenly spaced logarithmic bins of halo mass for all galaxies and satellite galaxies respectively , while the red open circles and black open rectangles show individual galaxies that are within the top five percent and bottom five percent by stellar mass in each halo mass bin .",
    "the key result of figure [ fig : sub1 ] is that the ratio of galaxy mass to @xmath47 is similar for central galaxies and satellite galaxies . between @xmath1 and @xmath4 ,",
    "satellite galaxies have lower growth rates compared to central galaxies of similar mass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , during the same time period , while central galaxies grow at a faster rate , their host halos also accrete mass and `` receive '' mergers of lower mass halos . the balance between stellar mass growth and halo mass growth leads to a similar @xmath37-@xmath47 relation at @xmath4 for central and satellite systems , in both simulations .",
    "note that in figure [ fig : sub1 ] as well as in the remainder of this section , we only consider galaxies that are above our resolution threshold at @xmath4 , with @xmath37 @xmath38 64@xmath55 = 5.8@xmath1010@xmath11 m@xmath40 .",
    "however , some satellite galaxies in dense environments experience mass loss between @xmath1 and @xmath4 , and , consequently , a fraction of satellites that are above the resolution threshold at @xmath1 are pushed below it by @xmath4 .",
    "we defer examination of this point to  4 .",
    "we assign galaxies to the halo / subhalo population via the monotonic mapping procedure described in  2 .",
    "the right - hand side column of figure [ fig : sub1 ] shows the distribution of the ratio of the stellar mass assigned to a halo to the stellar mass of the sph galaxy that is actually located within it for the sphnw simulation ( top ) and the sphw simulation ( bottom ) .",
    "in addition to the distribution for all galaxies ( black solid curve ) , we show the distribution for satellite galaxies alone ( red dotted curve ) . for most halos ,",
    "the sham assigned mass is close to the mass of the sph galaxy located within it in both the sphnw and the sphw simulations , although there are a small number of extreme outliers .",
    "we characterise the width of the distributions by @xmath56 such that 68% of galaxies have @xmath57 = @xmath58log @xmath59/@xmath60 @xmath41 @xmath56 where @xmath59 is the assigned mass and @xmath61 is the sph ( real ) mass . in the sphnw simulation ,",
    "the width of the distribution is @xmath56 = 0.09 , while in the sphw simulation @xmath56 = 0.11 . in both simulations ,",
    "the distribution of sham assigned masses for satellite galaxies is also centered on the sph mass , but there is greater scatter than in the case of central galaxies . for satellite galaxies in the sphnw simulation , the distribution of assigned mass",
    "is skewed such that the assigned mass is likely to be slightly higher than the sph mass .",
    "figure [ fig : sub2 ] presents the same distribution of @xmath58log @xmath59/@xmath60 at @xmath62 and 2 , and compared to the @xmath4 result from figure [ fig : sub1 ] .",

    "the fraction of satellite galaxies decreases with increasing redshift . despite this",
    ", @xmath56 shows a continuous trend of increasing with redshift , from 0.09 at @xmath4 to 0.13 at @xmath5 in the sphnw simulation , and from 0.11 at @xmath4 to 0.14 at @xmath5 in the sphw simulation .",
    "although the total baryonic mass ( not shown ) is equally well correlated with halo mass at @xmath5 and at @xmath4 , the higher mean gas fraction and the larger halo - to - halo scatter in gas fraction at high redshift leads to higher scatter in the halo mass - stellar mass relation .",
    "while the relationship between halo mass and galaxy stellar mass is roughly monotonic in our sph simulations , there is some scatter , with the strongest outliers arising from satellite galaxies .",
    "we examine the sources of this scatter in figure [ fig : sub3 ] , both to understand the physical processes that give rise to it and to explore the possibility of adding a parameter that would sharpen the subhalo abundance matching .",
    "we restrict ourselves to @xmath4 as the satellite galaxy sample is largest at this epoch . each panel plots satellite galaxy stellar mass as a function of @xmath47 at @xmath1 with sphnw in the top panels and sphw in the bottom .    in panel",
    "( a ) , points are colour coded by the mass of the @xmath4 halo ( not subhalo ) that hosts the satellite , and lines show the median relation between @xmath37(@xmath4 ) and @xmath47(@xmath1  ) in four bins of @xmath4 halo mass .",
    "the median curves are nearly identical for the four bins , indicating that the typical @xmath37/@xmath47 is at most minimally correlated with the final halo mass .",
    "the outlier points at low @xmath37/@xmath47 are mostly galaxies that have experienced stellar mass loss . these outliers are found in all @xmath63 bins ; one should not read too much into the relative numbers of outlier points as the total number of satellites varies from bin to bin .",
    "we caution that this figure does not show galaxies that have lost enough mass to fall below the @xmath37 = 64 @xmath55 threshold by @xmath4 ( see figure 11 , below ) .    in panel",

    "median relations for the other two populations are similar .",
    "there are some galaxies that are low @xmath37/@xmath47 outliers despite having gained mass since @xmath1 , indicating that at least some of this outlier population comes from satellites that had anomalously low @xmath37 at @xmath1 .",
    "panels ( d ) - ( f ) repeat this analysis for the sphw simulation .",
    "the results are qualitiatively similar , though the smaller number of galaxies in this simulation makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions .",
    "so far , we have used sham to assign stellar masses to halos and compare them to the stellar masses of sph galaxies located in those halos . however ,",
    "when sham is applied to an observed galaxy population , it is often used to assign luminosities to simulated halos to compare the luminosity dependence of the clustering properties of the simulated halos to that of the observed galaxies .",
    "the luminosity of a galaxy is correlated with its stellar mass , but is not reducible to a simple function of stellar mass because the stars formed at different times .",
    "we track the star formation histories of simulated galaxies in our sph simulations , and use the stellar population synthesis package of @xcite to compute their luminosities .",
    "we assume that stars are formed with a chabrier initial mass function .",
    "we assume solar metallicity and do not consider dust extinction . changing the initial mass function in the same way for all galaxies would alter the zero - point of the luminosity - stellar mass relation but would not be likely to add scatter , while including dust extinction would shift the mean relation and increase the scatter somewhat .",
    "the left column of figure [ fig : sub4 ] shows the @xmath64-band luminosity of sph galaxies against halo mass in the sphnw simulation ( top ) and the sphw simulation ( bottom ) . for galaxies that are the central objects of their parent halos ( henceforth central galaxies ) , the halo mass , @xmath47 , on the horizontal axis , is the mass of the so halo in which the galaxy is located at @xmath4 .",

    "the points show individual galaxies that are either in the top 5% or bottom 5% by luminosity in each halo mass bin .",
    "most of the low luminosity outliers are satellite galaxies .",
    "this is primarily because satellite galaxies typically have an older stellar population than central galaxies of similar stellar mass and are , therefore , less luminous .",
    "a secondary factor , of less importance , is the difference between central and satellite galaxies in the stellar mass - halo mass relation shown in figure [ fig : sub1 ] .    to assign luminosities to our halos , we rank order halos by mass and assign simulated galaxies",
    "rank ordered by @xmath64-band luminosity to them , as done previously for stellar mass .",

    "these applications raise the question of whether sham can be reliably applied to the rest - frame uv luminosities of high redshift galaxies , which depend mainly on their star formation rates ( sfrs ) rather than their stellar masses .    in our simulations ,",
    "the sfrs and stellar masses of high redshift galaxies are well correlated ( see , e.g. , figure 7 of @xcite ) . in the left panels of figure [ fig : sub5 ] , we directly investigate the relationship between the @xmath5 sfrs of our simulated galaxies and the properties of their parent halos , in the same format used previously for stellar mass and @xmath64-band luminosity at @xmath4 . to calculate the sfr of an sph galaxy",

    "in contrast to @xmath4 , where there is a significant passive , non star forming population , only @xmath71 % of galaxies have no star formation at @xmath5 , and these are excluded from the analysis . in the absence of dust extinction , the instantaneous sfr should be a good indicator of rest - frame uv luminosity , since the latter is dominated by the output of young , short - lived stars .",
    "we caution , however , that dust extinction corrections for lbg uv luminosities are typically factors of several ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a scatter in extinction at fixed sfr could add significant scatter to the relation between @xmath47 and uv luminosity . since colours provide an indication of extinction , the most effective strategy for observational analysis is probably to apply colour based extinction corrections before subhalo abundance matching , so that only the errors in the corrections add scatter .",
    "figure [ fig : sub5 ] shows that the relation between intrinsic sfr and @xmath47 at @xmath5 is nearly as tight as the relation between @xmath3-band luminosity and @xmath47 at @xmath4 .",

    "the sfr@xmath66/sfr@xmath68 histogram is , therefore , skewed towards overestimated sfrs for satellites , though this remains a small effect . for the wind simulation , there are many fewer galaxies above our 64 @xmath55 stellar mass threshold , and star formation rates at @xmath47 @xmath41 10@xmath73m@xmath40 are suppressed by the momentum driven outflows . in this simulation , there are more satellite outliers at high sfr , and the ( noisy ) histogram of sfr@xmath66/sfr@xmath68 for satellite galaxies shows an overall shift toward underestimated sfr . for central galaxies , gas fractions in the sphw simulation",

    "figure  [ fig : sub5 ] suggests that sham should be a reliable tool for assigning sfrs to simulated halo populations at high redshift ( given an observed sfr distribution ) , or for inferring the halo masses associated with observed lyman - break galaxies .",
    "we caution that our simulations do not produce a substantial population of passive galaxies at these redshifts , either central or satellite , and that physical mechanisms that strongly suppress star formation at high stellar mass could reduce the accuracy of sham assignment .",
    "so far we have applied subhalo abundance matching to the halo and subhalo hosts of galaxies in the sph simulations , where the condensed baryons may improve the survival of dark matter substructures .",

    "both the shamz0 and sham model predictions for the average number of galaxies per halo are in good agreement with the sph simulation . at high halo mass , however , shamz0 underpredicts the number of galaxies per halo because it does not account for subhalo mass loss .",
    "the stellar masses assigned to subhalos are too low , and galaxies that should be above a stellar mass threshold instead fall below it .",
    "sham , on the other hand , remains in good agreement with the sph simulation over a wide range of halo masses and galaxy stellar mass thresholds .",
    "figure [ fig : sub7 ] is the analogue of figure [ fig : sub6 ] , but using the sphw simulation instead of the sphnw simulation . as winds reduce stellar mass , the number density of galaxies above a given stellar mass threshold is lower than in the sphnw simulation . nonetheless , the trends for the sphnw simulation discussed above still hold .",
    "abundance matching using the @xmath4 mass of subhalos underpredicts the number of galaxies in massive halos .",

    "the slopes of the radial density profiles are similar for sph galaxies and for subhalos populated by sham and by shamz0 , but the normalisations and the inner truncations ( indicated by where the curves stop ) differ .",
    "the normalisation differences correspond to the differences in halo occupation at high @xmath63 seen in figures [ fig : sub7 ] and [ fig : sub9 ] .",
    "shamz0 predictions are always suppressed relative to sph galaxies because they neglect subhalo mass loss .",
    "tidal stripping is more severe for subhalos near the halo centre , exacerbating this effect and causing truncation of the shamz0 profiles at larger radii compared to sph galaxies .",
    "@xcite found a similar truncation effect even when including a global correction for subhalo mass loss .",
    "in contrast to shamz0 , sham overpredicts the number of galaxies in high mass halos , by a small factor in the sphnw simulation , and by 0.1 - 0.3 dex in the sphw simulation .",
    "this overprediction is a consequence of neglecting stellar mass loss that occurs after @xmath1  in the sph simulation , which is not accounted for in the sham recipe .",
    "the stellar mass loss is more severe for satellites close to the halo centre , so in this case the sph profiles truncate at larger radii than the sham profiles .",
    "the overprediction of satellite numbers by sham may seem surprising in light of the good agreement between assigned and true stellar masses seen in figure 2 , with distributions that peak at log @xmath59/@xmath61 = 0 and have only mild asymmetry . however , the relations in figure 2 ( and the versions divided by halo mass in figure 4 ) only include galaxies that remain above the 64 @xmath55 stellar mass threshold at @xmath4",
    ". in high mass halos , a significant fraction of satellites have dropped below the mass threshold by @xmath4 in the wind simulation , but sham would place all of these galaxies on the @xmath37-@xmath47 relation traced by the bulk of the satellites . in the no - wind simulation ,",
    "the fraction of satellites that suffer such severe mass loss is smaller .",
    "we suspect that galaxies in the wind simulation are more fragile because of their lower baryonic masses , and because they are typically less concentrated than galaxies formed without winds ; in both respects , they more closely resemble observed galaxies .",
    "however , satellites in the sphw simulation that are disrupted are close to the resolution threshold , and we can not rule out the possibility that their disruption is a numerical artifact . for comparison , in figure [ fig : sub8 ] , we also show the radial number density profile of sph galaxies and sham selected subhalos around the central galaxy of the halo only for galaxies above a higher mass threshold of 7.3@xmath1010@xmath82m@xmath40 in the no winds simulation and 2.8@xmath1010@xmath82m@xmath40 in the winds simulation , corresponding to a number density of 0.007 @xmath34 mpc@xmath35 . with the higher stellar mass threshold ,",
    "the differences in the normalisation and inner truncation of the sph and sham curves is substantially reduced .",
    "comparisons of our results with future higher resolution simulations of a similar volume will help clarify the extent to which our finite mass resolution affects our results .",

    "all galaxies above our adopted stellar mass threshold of 64 @xmath55 = 5.8@xmath1010@xmath82m@xmath40 are included which gives a space density of galaxies of 0.064 @xmath34 mpc@xmath35 in the sphnw simulation and 0.018 @xmath34 mpc@xmath35 in the sphw simulation .",

    "subhalo abundance matching ( sham ) has had impressive empirical success , reproducing observed galaxy clustering over a wide range of luminosity and redshift and correctly diagnosing ( via cluster mass - to - light ratios ) the overestimated matter clustering amplitude ( @xmath86 vs. @xmath87 ) in wmap1-era cosmological models @xcite .",
    "our investigation provides the first full - scale test of sham against hydrodynamic cosmological simulations , where the correct identification between galaxies and subhalos is known a priori , including both a simulation with minimal feedback ( sphnw ) and a simulation with momentum - driven winds that better reproduces the observed galaxy stellar mass function @xcite .",
    "this investigation yields physical insight into the galaxy formation process in these simulations , and it demonstrates the strengths and potential limitations of sham as a tool for interpreting observed galaxy clustering , significantly extending earlier studies by @xcite and @xcite .    when we consider galaxies above our adopted stellar mass threshold at @xmath4 , @xmath37 @xmath88 64 @xmath55 = 5.8@xmath1010@xmath11 m@xmath40 , we find a tight correlation between galaxy stellar mass and the mass of the parent halo or subhalo . for central galaxies ,",
    "we consider the full mass of the spherical overdensity at @xmath4 , while for satellite galaxies we use the mass of the parent halo just before the epoch @xmath1  when it first becomes a satellite .",
    "importantly , the median relation and scatter between @xmath37 and @xmath47 are similar for central galaxies and satellite galaxies , in both simulations , and the outlier fraction for satellite galaxies is only modestly higher , mainly because of stellar mass loss in some satellites after @xmath1  . as a result , sham assignment of stellar masses is remarkably effective in both simulations .",
    "the 68% scatter in @xmath3 = log @xmath59/@xmath61 , where @xmath59 is the assigned stellar mass and @xmath61 the real ( simulation ) stellar mass , is @xmath56 = 0.09 dex for sphnw and 0.11 dex for sphw .",
    "the distribution of @xmath3 is only mildly asymmetric , with a small extended tail of outliers .",
    "similar results , with slightly increased scatter , hold at @xmath89 0.5 , 1 and 2 .",
    "we find no clear correlation between residuals from the @xmath37-@xmath47 relation and the satellite epoch at @xmath1  or the parent mass of the @xmath4 halo , so our tests do not suggest a way to further tighten sham by considering additional properties .    using @xmath3-band luminosity in place of stellar mass yields similar results , but with a larger population of outliers among satellites caused by their systematically older stellar populations and thus higher @xmath90 ratios .",
    "sham should , therefore , be applied to stellar masses ( estimated from luminosity and colour or spectral energy distribution ) when possible , or to luminosity in redder bands that more faithfully trace stellar mass . at @xmath5 ,",
    "instantaneous star formation rates , which should be a good proxy for observed - frame optical luminosities , are well correlated with @xmath47 , with similar correlations for central and satellite galaxies .",
    "sham assignment of star formation rates at this redshift is quite effective with a scatter in log sfr@xmath66/sfr@xmath68 of 0.12 dex in sphnw and 0.16 dex in sphw .",
    "this result reinforces empirical evidence , based on galaxy clustering data , that sham is an effective tool for modeling lyman - break galaxies at high redshift .",
    "sham is traditionally applied to n - body rather than sph simulations ( or to analytic descriptions calibrated on n - body ) . to test this standard form of sham ,",
    "we have applied it to the adaptahop subhalo population of a pure dark matter ( dm ) simulation started from the same initial conditions as the sph simulations . because subhalo positions within parent halos shift between sph and dm @xcite , we have focused our comparison on halo occupation statistics and radial profiles , which together determine many properties of observable galaxy clustering , and on the real space two - point correlation function .",
    "using the galaxy stellar mass function of the sphnw or sphw simulation as input , sham ( applied to the dm simulation ) does quite well in reproducing the corresponding mean halo occupation , @xmath74@xmath91)@xmath75 , and the slope of the galaxy radial profile in high mass halos . in sphnw , but not sphw , sham traces the individual halo - to - halo variations in galaxy number at similar halo mass .",
    "use of subhalo masses at @xmath1  rather than @xmath4 makes a critical difference ; if we use @xmath4 subhalo masses , the galaxy occupation in high mass halos is systematically depressed because subhalos lose mass by tidal stripping after becoming satellites .",
    "traditional sham ( using @xmath1  masses ) , by contrast , tends to overpredict the galaxy numbers in high mass halos .",
    "we trace this discrepancy to the small but not negligible population of satellite galaxies that suffer severe stellar mass loss in the sph simulations , so that they move from above our resolution threshold at @xmath1  to below it at @xmath4 .",
    "the subhalos themselves remain identifiable in the dm simulation , and sham populates them with galaxies that lie on the main @xmath37-@xmath47 relation .",
    "the effect is more significant in the sphw simulation , whose galaxies are apparently more vulnerable to severe mass loss because of their shallower baryonic potential wells .",
    "the mean occupation of high mass halos in sphw is overpredicted by 0.1 - 0.3 dex , while in sphnw the offset is less than 0.1 dex . for sphnw",

    "however , if the stellar mass threshold is increased to 2.7@xmath1010@xmath13 m@xmath40 , then the sham predicted two - point correlation function agrees with that of sph galaxies to better than 20% on all scales except @xmath64 @xmath41 0.3 @xmath26mpc , where the discrepancy widens to 50% .",
    "this improvement is achieved because galaxies that suffer severe mass loss are typically low stellar mass galaxies in low mass subhalos ( @xmath47 @xmath84 @xmath92 m@xmath40 ) . while we would expect low mass galaxies in low mass subhalos to be more susceptible to severe mass loss , further investigation with higher resolution simulations is required to understand the extent to which this is a numerical artifact caused by proximity of the mass to the threshold above which we are reliably able to resolve galaxies . for galaxies with luminosity l@xmath38l@xmath93",

    "is the primary determinant of galaxy stellar mass , luminosity , and ( at high redshift ) star formation rate .",
    "the most significant secondary factor , and thus the most significant limitation on the accuracy of sham , is the small fraction of satellite galaxies that suffer severe stellar mass loss even though their host subhalos survive .",
    "the sensitivity to feedback , indicated by the difference between our sphnw and sphw simulations , motivates further investigation of galaxy mass loss in high mass halos for a wider range of feedback prescriptions .    for galaxies with @xmath94 @xmath70 @xmath95 , the sphw simulation predicts excessive galaxy masses and excessive late - time star formation , indicating the need for an additional physical mechanism such as agn feedback .",
    "the accuracy of sham for high luminosity galaxies will depend on how tightly correlated such feedback is with halo mass .",
