    "molecular dynamics ( md ) is an important tool for investigating properties of a fluid under flow and is often used to explore systems under conditions which are difficult to achieve and control in experiments , e.g. , flows at high shear rates in nanochannels @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions ( bc s ) for such computer experiments are very important , especially for systems of nanoscale dimensions in which properties of the wall - fluid interface have a significant effect on the flow .",
    "some of the earlier md simulations of couette flow considered smooth walls and reported wall slip @xcite .",
    "however , a more recent study showed that for wetting liquids , slip arises only at very high shear rates at which the response of the fluid to the applied shear is no longer linear @xcite .",
    "some authors introduced the no - slip bc s explicitly , i.e. , they assumed that the fluid layer next to the wall moves with the velocity of the wall , but subsequent studies have shown that imposition of such bc s is incorrect since whether the fluid particles will slip at the wall or not , depends on the strength of the wall - fluid interaction @xcite .",
    "along with implementing the correct bc s , it is important to control the temperature in the system by choosing a thermostat which closely mimics experiment and is computationally efficient .",
    "recent computer simulation studies showed that the choice of a thermostat has major effects on fluid flow at high shear rates in confined channels @xcite .",
    "the authors considered several scenarios : ( 1 ) thermostating the wall ( tw ) , ( 2 ) the fluid ( tf ) and ( 3 ) both the wall and the fluid ( twtf ) . in tw",
    "the walls are made up of particles which are tethered by springs to their equilibrium lattice positions .",
    "tw simulations can reproduce the temperature profiles in actual experiments where the extra heat due to shear is dissipated through the walls .",
    "however , since the wall particles are oscillating around their mean positions on some characteristic time scale , the effective roughness of the walls depends on the applied shear rate and therefore tw simulations fail to describe systems in which wall roughness does not depend on the flow rate . in order to maintain constant wall roughness",
    "a possible choice is to use tf .",
    "this can be done either by assuming a linear velocity profile ( profile - biased thermostat ) , or by measuring the actual velocity profile obtained in the simulation and implementing the thermostat using this profile ( profile - unbiased thermostat ) .",
    "a profile - biased thermostat is limited in its accuracy since in many cases the linear velocity profile assumption breaks down at high shear rates . while this problem can be solved by using a profile - unbiased thermostat",
    ", tf thermostats can not reproduce the experimental conditions in which only the walls are thermostated .",
    "finally , twtf simulations are computationally expensive and tend to distort the effects of viscous heating on fluid dynamics that become increasingly important at higher shear rates .    in the present work ,",
    "we use md simulations to study the effect of simple shear on a fluid of monodisperse particles that interact with each other via a lennard - jones ( lj ) potential and are confined in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) nanochannel . in order to amplify the effects of shear on the temperature and density profiles in the nanochannel , we study this system in the region of the phase diagram where the compressibility is large , i.e. , at the triple point density and at temperature that is slightly higher than that of the liquid - solid transition .",
    "steady shear is applied by moving the upper wall with a constant velocity while the lower wall remains at rest throughout the simulation .",
    "the walls are made of particles which are fixed with respect to each other and therefore the roughness of wall remains constant during the simulation .",
    "we thermostat two layers of fluid particles next to each wall @xcite , and therefore allow temperature gradients to develop between the walls and the bulk of the fluid at high shear rates where shear - induced heating becomes important .",

    "the simulations are performed in @xmath7 ensemble .",
    "the dynamics is solved by using a velocity - verlet integrator with a time step of @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the lj time unit .",
    "most of the results were obtained at triple point density ( 0.694 ) that corresponds to @xmath10 particles in an area of @xmath11 ( other densities were obtained by changing the number of particles at fixed volume of the system ) . the nanochannel is constructed by placing two parallel solid walls at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the distance between the walls .",
    "each of the walls is made of @xmath15 particles with centers located at positions @xmath12 and @xmath16 , respectively , such that the horizontal separation between the wall particles is @xmath17 , which corresponds to the minimum of the lj potential .",
    "the wall - fluid particle interactions are the same as between fluid particles .",

    "[ snapshotpzero ] and  [ snapshotpthree ] .",

    "having established the effect of shear on the density profile we turn to examine its effect on the flow by measuring the y - dependence of the average velocity @xmath55 for a range of applied shear rates ( the average velocity of the particles in the @xmath22-direction vanishes , as expected on symmetry grounds ) . to this end",
    "we divide the system into @xmath56 bins along the @xmath22 direction ( we choose a lower number of bins as compared to the density measurements , to avoid bins with zero particles ) . as shown in fig .",
    "[ velocityprofile ] , around shear rate of @xmath57 one begins to observe deviations from a linear velocity profile , @xmath58 .",
    "these deviations manifest themselves in the formation of a boundary layer that moves together with the neighboring wall ( and another boundary layer that remains at rest with respect to the stationary wall ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been previously observed in the case of strong wall - fluid interactions in a three dimensional lj system and has been referred to as _ locking _ @xcite . when the shear rate is further increased , the number of layers moving with the wall velocity increases and the velocity gradients in the bulk of the system increase as well beyond their nominal value ( @xmath59 ) .    since we would like to gain insight about the origin of the observed layering and locking phenomena we proceed to examine the temperature profiles that develop in the system with increasing shear rate .",
    "we find that the temperature profile is parabolic ( in @xmath22 ) , with a maximum at the center of the system ( the height of this maximum increases with shear rate as @xmath60 - see inset in fig .",
    "[ tempprofile ] ) , and decreases to the nominal temperature @xmath21 at the two thermostated layers near each wall , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tempprofile ] .",
    "similar temperature profiles were also observed in other computer simulations of shear flow @xcite .",
    "this concurs with the expectation that shear - induced viscous heating leads to higher temperature gradients , since the only way to remove excess heat from the system is to increase these gradients in order to enhance the diffusion of heat towards the thermostated walls .",

    "[ densityprofilecomp ] we compare the steady state density profile of a sheared fluid with @xmath61 to that of a fluid at rest but with an identical temperature profile . since the resulting density profiles are indistinguishable , we conclude that shear - induced layering arises as the result of the coupling between density and temperature gradients in the sheared fluid and thus the density depends on the shear rate through its effect on the temperature profile , i.e. , @xmath62 is a function of @xmath63 only .",
    "the density profile obtained for equilibrium fluid ( black thick line ) is compared to that obtained for @xmath51 ( red solid line ) , both with identical temperature profile . ]    in the absence of shear , the coupling between local temperature and concentration profiles gives rise to thermophoresis , also known as the ludwig - soret effect @xcite .",
    "although the ludwig - soret effect has been mostly studied in colloidal dispersions and binary mixtures @xcite , self - thermophoresis in compressible single - component fluids has also been discussed @xcite . since in our case",

    "the solid line is a guide to the eye . ]    since at high shear rates large deviations from the linear velocity profile are observed , we expect other signatures of non - newtonian fluid behavior to appear as well ( e.g. , a non - uniform distribution of stresses , shear thinning / thickening of viscosity , etc ) . in order to compute the stress tensor from our md results",
    ", we express the @xmath79 component of the microscopic stress tensor in terms of instantaneous particle velocities and interparticle forces : @xmath80     in the upper panel shear stress is shown across @xmath81 bins in the @xmath22-direction at @xmath82 . in the lower panel ,",

    "as expected , at lower shear rates ( e.g. , @xmath82 ) , the shear stress is distributed uniformly perpendicular to the direction of flow . at higher shear rates",
    "@xmath84 becomes a function of @xmath22 , with a minimum at the center of the channel ( fig .",

    "is presented .",

    "[ shearviscosity ] , we present the shear viscosity @xmath85 as a function of shear rate @xmath59 . within the accuracy of our simulation ,",
    "the viscosity remains constant up to @xmath91 ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ shearviscosity ] ) .",
    "as the shear rate is further increased , there is a gradual transition to a shear thinning regime in which viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate .",
    "this regime extends up to @xmath92 at which point shear thinning is replaced by shear thickening and viscosity increases with shear rate .",
    "in this paper we used computer simulations to study the dynamics of a compressible fluid in steady shear flow .",
    "we found that as the shear rate is increased the fluid develops a highly non - uniform density profile , with pronounced solid - like layering near the walls , the extent of which increases progressively with shear rate .",
    "this shear - induced layering originates in viscous heating of the fluid by the imposed shear that leads to the appearance of large temperature gradients between the bulk of the fluid and the confining walls which are kept at constant temperature ( for technical reasons we thermostat the fluid layers near the walls rather than the walls themselves ) .",
    "the coupling between temperature and density gradients gives rise to the ludwig - soret effect and has been the subject of numerous studies in the past but , to the best of our knowledge , the present work is the first to demonstrate that such thermophoretic effects can take place in a _ homogeneous fluid in shear flow_.    in addition to the study of the density and the temperature profiles we also looked at other dynamical properties of the fluid such as its velocity profile , shear stress and viscosity .",
    "we observed large deviations from linear velocity profiles , and other non - newtonian phenomena at high shear rates , such as inhomogeneous stress distributions , shear thinning and shear thickening .",
    "while locking has been found in previous computer simulations in the limit of large wall roughness , the observation of shear - enhanced locking has not been reported prior to this work .",
    "all the results reported so far were obtained for a particular value of temperature ( @xmath93 ) and density ( @xmath50 ) , not far from the triple point of the two dimensional lj system .",
    "we studied the behavior of the system at other temperatures and densities as well ( not shown ) .",
    "as expected , we find that if the temperature is raised from @xmath93 to @xmath94 at triple point density ( 0.694 ) all the effects reported in this work ( e.g. , layering and deviations from linear velocity profile ) are strongly suppressed . if the temperature is reduced towards the fluid - solid transition temperature of @xmath87 , the above effects are strongly enhanced but since under these conditions the lengthscale of density fluctuations becomes comparable to system size , we did not undertake a careful study of this regime .",
    "we found that both layering and locking effects can be enhanced by keeping the temperature constant ( at @xmath93 ) and increasing the density to 0.77 which is close to liquid - solid coexistence density at this temperature .",
    "since the results are qualitatively similar to the ones reported in this work , we will not present them here .",
    "we would like to conclude with a comment on the experimental relevance of our results . even though we simulated the flow of compressible fluids in two dimensions , we expect similar behavior to be observed in compressible near - critical fluids in three dimensions as well . while the shear rates reached in the simulations are unrealistically high , we believe that shear - induced heating of the kind described in our work can be experimentally realized under less extreme conditions in real fluids .",
    "another interesting and experimentally - relevant possibility is that shear - induced thermophoresis can lead to spatial segregation in multicomponent fluid mixtures .",
