    "generically , the device consists of two parallel optical waveguides which are coupled by an evanescent overlap of the guided modes .",
    "these may operate with both modes propagating in the same direction , or in opposite directions .",
    "the quantum statistical properties of this device when the nonlinearity is of the @xmath0 type have been theoretically investigated  @xcite , among the predictions being energy transfer between the waveguides  @xcite and the generation of correlated squeezing  @xcite .",
    "the production of entangled states of the electromagnetic field with an intracavity kerr nonlinear coupler in which one of the modes is externally pumped was analysed by leoski and miranowicz  @xcite . in the travelling wave configuration , the generation of entanglement via coupled parametric downconversion has been analysed by herec _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . olsen and drummond  @xcite and olivier and olsen  @xcite",
    "have analysed coupled intracavity downconversion in terms of continuous variable entanglement in both the above and below threshold regimes .",
    "the system we consider here consists of two coupled nonlinear materials with @xmath0 nonlinearity , operating inside a pumped fabry - perot cavity .",
    "the details of the coupling are as in the work of bache _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who analysed a scheme using coupled second harmonic generation in terms of intensity correlations between the modes .",
    "the coupling is realised by evanescent overlaps of the intracavity modes inside the nonlinear medium , which can be either a single kerr crystal pumped by two spatially separated lasers , or two kerr waveguides .",
    "this type of coupling has already been investigated both theoretically and experimentally@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will calculate the phase - dependent correlations between the two outputs of the cavity which demonstrate that the system is a source of continuous variable entangled states and states which exhibit the einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr )  @xcite paradox .",
    "the spatial separation of the entangled output modes means that they do not have to be separated by optical devices before measurements can be made , along with the unavoidable losses which would result from this procedure .",
    "the correlations are tunable by controlling some of the operational degrees of freedom of the system , including the evanescent couplings between the two modes , the input power and the cavity detunings .",
    "the entanglement is also between outputs which can be of macroscopic intensities , which may be an advantage compared to the nondegenerate optical parametric oscillator ( ndopo ) operating above threshold .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite recently demonstrated bright entangled outputs with such a device , but were not able to make an unambiguous demonstration of the epr paradox due to losses .",
    "the scheme we analyse here may provide a more stable route to a demonstration with spatially separated bright beams .",
    "we consider two evanescently coupled @xmath0 materials inside a pumped fabry - perot , which could be experimentally realised with , for example , a dual core fiber with dielectric mirrors at each end  @xcite .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation can be written as @xmath1 where the pumping hamiltonian is @xmath2 the damping hamiltonian is @xmath3 the kerr hamiltonian is @xmath4 and the coupling hamiltonian is @xmath5 in the above , the @xmath6 are the annihilation operators for the intracavity modes , the @xmath7 represent the classical pumping terms , the @xmath8 are bath operators , the @xmath9 represent the kerr nonlinearities , and @xmath10 represents the evanescent coupling .",

    "proceeding via the usual methods  @xcite , and making the correspondences between the operators @xmath11 and the c - numbers @xmath12 , we find the following it equations , @xmath13 where the @xmath14 are real gaussian noise terms with the correlations @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "we now have a set of equations which are a coupled version of those used by drummond and walls to describe a model of optical bistability with an intracavity kerr medium  @xcite . in principle",
    "these equations may be solved to calculate any quantity which can be written as a time - normally ordered operator product .",
    "however , rather than immediately solving the full equations , we will linearise them about their classical steady - state solutions and examine the stability of the system .",
    "this is equivalent to treating the system as an ornstein - uhlenbeck process  @xcite and allows for simple determination of the output spectra in parameter regions where the process is valid .",

    "it is obvious that for the cavity on resonance ( i.e @xmath38 ) , bistability is possible for any value of the coupling greater than @xmath39 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bistab ] , and that for @xmath40 , bistability is possible for any value of the coupling .",
    "we will not investigate this bistability further at this time except to remark that a fully quantum analysis of an uncoupled oscillator showed that quantum fluctuations removed the bistability which was seen in a semi - classical analysis  @xcite .    ,",

    "we will now return to the steady - state solutions themselves .",
    "[ eq : cubic ] may be solved analytically to give solutions which are rather complicated , so that we will proceed numerically in the general case . however , for @xmath37 , the real solution simplifies to @xmath42 which may then be substituted into eq .",

    "writing the equation in the above form ( [ eq : matriz ] ) leads to a particularly simple expression for the intracavity spectral correlation matrix , @xmath54 after which we use the standard input - output relations  @xcite to relate these to quantities which may be measured outside the cavity .",
    "the matrix @xmath55 contains all the information necessary to calculate the correlation functions which we will give in section  [ sec : measurement ] .",
    "entanglement is a property of quantum mechanics which is related to the inseparability of the combined density matrix of a system into density matrices for its subsystems . in the present situation ,",
    "we are interested in continuous variable bipartite entanglement between the modes @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the presence of this entanglement can be shown in a number of ways . before we proceed with the definition of the criteria we will use here , we will define the optical quadratures which will be used , as their actual definition affects the form of the inequalities .",
    "we define the quadrature operators at the phase angle @xmath58 as @xmath59 so that @xmath60=2i\\delta_{jk}$ ] and therefore the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) requires @xmath61 . in the interests of notational simplicity",
    ", we will label the quadrature @xmath62 as @xmath63 .",
    "we also note here that our results will be presented in terms of output spectral correlations , as these are the quantities that are experimentally measurable , and that the same inequalities as presented below will hold for these .",
    "we will also present the correlation functions in terms of intracavity variances , again for reasons of notational simplicity .",
    "the first of the entanglement measures is due to duan _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and also simon  @xcite , who developed inseparability criteria which are necessary and sufficient for gaussian states , and sufficient in general .",
    "these criteria have recently been shown to be special cases of an infinite series of inequalities based on the non - negativity of determinants of matrices constructed from certain combinations of operator moments  @xcite . in the general case",
    ", we may define the quadrature operators similarly to duan as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is an arbitrary non - zero real number .",
    "it may be shown that , for separable states , @xmath66 with any violation of this inequality therefore demonstrating the presence of bipartite entanglement . in what follows",
    ", we will choose @xmath67 so that the lower bound of the inequality is @xmath68 . while this is not the optimal choice for the general case , it is sufficient for purposes of comparison with the other measures we will use to categorise our system . in fig .",
    "[ fig : duan ] we give the predictions for the values of the spectral output correlation @xmath69 for different values of the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "we see that , as the interaction strength increases , the maximum violation moves away from zero frequency and is found at different quadrature angles , with the spectra becoming bifurcated .",
    "this is different from the cases with coupled @xmath70 interactions , where setting the detunings equal in strength to the evanescent couplings meant that the optimal correlations were found for zero quadrature angle  @xcite .",
    "it happens because the @xmath0 interaction itself also changes the quadrature angles at which the optimal correlations may be measured  @xcite , acting in some sense as an intensity dependent detuning  @xcite . in principle",
    "it may be possible to dynamically control the detuning , coupling and intensities so that the largest violations of the inequalities were found for @xmath71 , although we will not investigate this further because it is relatively simple to control the phase of local oscillators to choose the appropriate angles .",
    "we have shown the results for the quadrature angles at which the violation of the inequalities is maximised for different values of the nonlinear interactions . the existence of the maximal violations at finite frequencies could be a real operational advantage , due to the excess noise which is found experimentally at low frequencies .    .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath72 , at a quadrature angle of @xmath73 , the dashed line is for @xmath74 , at an angle of @xmath75 and the dash - dotted line is for @xmath76 , at an angle of @xmath77 . the inequality is violated and entanglement is demonstrated for any value less than @xmath68 . ]",
    "an alternative to indicate the existence of bipartite entanglement is a demonstration of the epr paradox , which , as proven by reid  @xcite , is sufficient to demonstrate inseparability of the system density matrix .",
    "the epr paradox itself was introduced in an attempt to show that quantum mechanics was not a complete and locally realistic theory  @xcite .",
    "schrdinger replied by introducing the concept of entangled states which were not compatible with classical ideas such as local realism  @xcite . in 1989 reid proposed a physical test of the epr paradox using optical quadrature amplitudes  @xcite , which are mathematically identical to the position and momentum originally considered by epr .",
    "reid later expanded on this work , demonstrating that the satisfaction of her two - mode 1989 criterion , and hence a demonstration of epr correlations , always implies bipartite quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown by tan  @xcite that the existence of two orthogonal quadratures , the product of whose variances violates the limits set by the heisenberg uncertainty principle , provides evidence of entanglement .",
    "tan demonstrated this in the context of teleportation , with the outputs from a nondegenerate opa mixed on a beamsplitter .    to examine the utility of the system for the production of states which exhibit the epr paradox",
    ", we will follow the approach of reid  @xcite , as outlined in dechoum _",
    "et al . _",
    "we assume that a measurement of the @xmath78 quadrature , for example , will allow us to infer , with some error , the value of the @xmath79 quadrature , and similarly for the @xmath80 quadratures .",

    "the inferred variances for the @xmath83 quadratures are simply found by swapping the indices @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "as the @xmath84 and @xmath80 operators do not commute , the products of the actual variances obey a heisenberg uncertainty relation , with @xmath85 . hence we find a demonstration of the epr paradox whenever @xmath86 in fig .",
    "[ fig : epr ] we show results for the product of the inferred spectral output variances , indicating a clear demonstration of the epr paradox and hence entanglement between the modes .",
    "the violations are found to be maximum for the same quadrature angles as found for the duan inequalities , with a qualitative similarity between the results .",
    "the small violations at higher frequencies , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : duan ] for the duan inequalities , were not so apparent for the products of the inferred variances .",
    "this can be understood because the duan criterion provides necessary and sufficient conditions for entanglement with a gaussian system , while the epr correlation provides a sufficiency criterion .",
    "operationally , it would not be a problem as the major violations at lower frequencies are potentially more interesting , due to the higher intensities of the output fields closer to the cavity resonance frequency .    .",

    ". this measure has been used by mancini to quantify the effects of feedback on continuous variable entanglement in a two - mode system  @xcite .",
    "we note here that this measure is defined for gaussian states , to which we are also limited here due to the linearisation process we have used .",

    "the values shown in fig .  [ fig : lneg ] are valid for all angles , even though the other two measures will not indicate entanglement for arbitrary angle .",
    "this shows that the logarithmic negativity is useful for demonstrating that continuous variable entanglement exists in a given system , but does not tell us at which quadrature angles the system may exhibit the necessary properties for uses such as teleportation .",

    "this entanglement has been demonstrated by the calculation of three different measures , the first two of which give maximum violations of the appropriate inequalities at particular quadrature angles , and the third of which indicates the presence of entanglement in a manner which is not phase dependent . as this device could be constructed using integrated optics and only needs to be optimised for one frequency of operation , it could provide a rugged and stable source of bright entangled beams which could be of some utility for such technological uses as , for example , quantum communication channels and continuous variable teleportation ."
