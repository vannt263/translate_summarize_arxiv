    "inspiraling black holes are among the strongest astrophysical sources of gravitational radiation .",
    "the expectation that such systems may soon be studied with gravitational wave detectors has focused attention on solving einstein s equations for predictions of gravitational wave content .",
    "although the einstein equations present several unique challenges to the numerical relativist  @xcite , on several of which we do not elaborate here , black holes present one particular additional challenge : they contain physical curvature singularities .",
    "while the infinities of the gravitational fields associated with this singularity can not be represented directly on a computer , the spacetime near the black hole must be given adequately to preserve the proper physics .",
    "different strategies have thus been developed to computationally represent black holes , while removing the singularity from the grid .",
    "one method exploits the gauge freedom of general relativity by choosing a time coordinate that advances normally far from a singularity , slows down as a singularity is approached , and freezes in the immediate vicinity .",
    "coordinates with this property are `` singularity avoiding ''  @xcite .",
    "while singularity avoiding coordinates have some advantages , one potential disadvantage is that the hypersurfaces of constant time may become highly distorted , leading to large gradients in the metric components .",
    "these slice - stretching ( or `` grid - stretching '' ) effects , however , can be partially avoided through an advantageous combination of lapse and shift conditions .",
    "for example , long - term evolutions of single black holes have been reported by alcubierre et al .",
    "singularity avoiding slicings may be combined with black hole excision , a second method for removing the singularities from the computational domain .",
    "currently , long - term binary black hole evolutions have only been performed using both techniques together .",
    "excision is based on the physical properties of event horizons and the expectation that singularities always form within such horizons , and thus can not be seen by distant observers , as formulated by the cosmic censor conjecture  @xcite . as no future - directed causal curve connects events inside the black hole to events outside",
    ", unruh proposed that one could simply remove the black hole from the computational domain , leaving the exterior computation unaffected  @xcite .",
    "thus the black hole singularity is removed by placing an inner boundary on the computational domain at or within the event horizon .",
    "excision has been extensively used in numerical relativity in the context of cauchy formulations .",
    "in particular , excision with moving boundaries , which is the primary focus of this paper , was explored in  @xcite .",
    "the physical principles that form the basis of excision make the idea beautiful in its simplicity .",
    "translating them into a workable numerical recipe for black hole evolutions , on the other hand , requires some attention to detail .",
    "two general questions arise regarding the implementation of excision , ( 1 ) where and how to define the inner boundary ? and ( 2 ) how to move the boundary",
    "? the first question applies to all excision algorithms , while the last question is specific to implementations where the excision boundary moves with respect to the grid . in addressing these questions",
    "we assume a symmetric ( or at least strongly ) hyperbolic formulation  @xcite .",
    "this is because excision fundamentally relies on the characteristic structure of the einstein equations near event horizons , a structure which can only be completely defined and understood for strongly and symmetric hyperbolic sets of equations .",
    "the first question involves several considerations , including the location of the boundary , its geometry , and its discrete representation .",
    "the requirement that all modes at the excision boundary are leaving the computational domain can be non trivial .",
    "it may appear that this condition would be satisfied simply by choosing any boundary within the event horizon ( or , for practical purposes , the apparent horizon ) .",
    "however , the outflow property of the excision boundary depends on the characteristic speeds of the system in the normal directions to the boundary .",
    "for example , in the analytic schwarzschild solution , assuming that the system has characteristic speeds bounded by the light cone , a spherical boundary can be excised at @xmath0 .",
    "a cubical boundary , on the other hand , imposes an onerous restriction on the excision volume : in cartesian kerr ",
    "schild coordinates the faces of a cube centered on the black hole must be less than @xmath1 in length  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , as was first noticed by lehner  @xcite , for the rotating kerr solution in kerr ",
    "schild coordinates a well - defined cubical excision boundary is impossible for interesting values of the spin parameter .",
    "( see the appendix for further discussion . )",
    "whereas with a pseudospectral collocation method the implementation of a smooth spherical excision boundary is trivial  @xcite , this is generally not the case for finite differencing .",
    "as may be expected , smooth boundaries , which can be adapted to the spacetime geometry , allow the excision boundary to be as far from the singularity as possible , making the most efficient use of the technique .",
    "the discrete representation of boundaries can be a delicate issue , especially in numerical relativity where many large - scale finite difference computations are done in cartesian coordinates .",
    "we focus our attention on smooth boundaries that may be defined as a constant value in the computational coordinates , e.g. , @xmath2 in spherical coordinates describes a simple spherical boundary .",
    "the importance of accurately representing smooth boundaries has been demonstrated for the euler equations , for example , by dadone and grossman for finite volume methods  @xcite , and bassi and rebay  @xcite using finite elements .",
    "bassi and rebay studied high resolution planar fluid flow around a cylinder .",
    "they report spurious entropy production near the cylinder wall , which corrupts the solution even on extremely refined grids , when the cylindrical boundary is approximated by a polygon .",
    "furthermore , in the conformal field equations approach to general relativity , a smooth boundary is required to avoid uncontrollable numerical constraint violation  @xcite .",
    "the second question applies to excision boundaries that move with respect to the grid .",
    "when the inner boundary moves , points that previously were excised enter the physical part of the grid , and must be provided with physical data for all fields . in recently proposed excision algorithms ,",
    "these data are obtained by extrapolating the solution from the physical domain of the calculation .",
    "numerical experiments have indicated that the stability of the method is very sensitive to the details of the extrapolation , see e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite . to examine the black hole excision problem with moving inner boundaries",
    ", we adopt an approach with some unique features .",
    "the heart of our method for moving excision is to use multiple coordinate patches such that each boundary is at a fixed location in one coordinate system .",
    "adapting coordinate patches to the boundary geometry allows us to excise as far from the singularity as possible and simplifies the determination of the outflow character of the excision boundary .",
    "the motion of the boundaries is incorporated through the relationships among the various coordinate systems .",
    "the grids representing the different coordinate patches overlap and communicate via interpolation .",
    "this technique is an extension of the one used in well - posedness proofs for problems in general domains ( see sec .",
    "13.4 of @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the algorithm by solving the massless klein - gordon equation on a fixed , boosted schwarzschild background .",
    "we find that the algorithm is stable for ( apparently ) all values of the boost parameter , @xmath3 , and present results here showing stable evolutions for several cases with @xmath4 .",
    "we specialize to axially symmetric spacetimes to reduce the computational requirements for our single - processor code .",
    "axially symmetric spacetimes have sometimes been avoided in numerical relativity , with notable exceptions , see e.g. ,  @xcite , owing to the difficulties in developing stable finite difference equations containing the axis of symmetry . in this paper",
    "we further present finite differencing methods for the wave equation in axially symmetric spacetimes in canonical cylindrical and spherical coordinates .",
    "these differencing schemes are second order accurate and their stability for a single grid is proved using the energy method @xcite .",
    "maximally dissipative boundary conditions are applied using the projection method of olsson @xcite .",
    "we present the differencing algorithm in detail , and indicate precisely how boundary conditions are applied .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "[ sec : fosh ] and provide an energy preserving discretization . in sec .",
    "[ sec : we_flat ] we analyze the axisymmetric wave equation around a minkowski background as an introduction to our numerical methods .",
    "the analysis is then repeated for the black hole background case in sec .",
    "[ sec : we_bh ] .",
    "the excision of a boosted black hole with the overlapping grid method is described in sec .",
    "[ sec : boosted ] .",
    "the numerical experiments , along with several convergence tests , are included in sec .",
    "[ sec : numexp ] .",
    "our primary goal is to obtain a numerical algorithm for excision with moving black holes that is stable and convergent ( in the limit that the mesh spacing goes to zero ) .",
    "these desired properties for the discrete system closely mirror the continuum properties of well - posed initial boundary value problems ( ibvps ) : the existence of a unique solution that depends continuously on the initial and boundary data .",
    "furthermore , we believe that we will not obtain long - term convergent discrete solutions _ unless _ the underlying continuum problem is also well - posed . unfortunately there are few mathematical results concerning the well - posedness of general classes of equations .",
    "the energy method , however , can be used with symmetric hyperbolic ibvps , and gives sufficient conditions for well - posedness .",
    "when a black hole moves with respect to some coordinate system , the inner excision boundary must also move .",
    "we use multiple coordinate patches , such that every boundary is fixed with respect to at least one coordinate system . coordinate transformations relate the coordinate systems , and become time dependent when the hole moves .",
    "the movement of the inner boundary is also expressed by these time - dependent coordinate transformations .",
    "these ideas are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : patches ] .     surrounded by an event horizon",
    "@xmath5 is moving with respect to the base coordinate system . a coordinate patch ( shaded region )",
    "adapted to @xmath6 follows the motion of the singularity . with respect to this patch , @xmath5 is a purely outflow boundary and requires no boundary conditions .",
    "the base system terminates somewhere inside the shaded region and it gets boundary data from the moving patch .",
    "similarly , the data at the outer boundary of the moving patch is taken from the base system.,height=302 ]    in our axially symmetric model problem of a scalar field on a boosted schwarzschild spacetime , the computational frame is covered with cylindrical coordinates , while a second patch of spherical coordinates is co - moving with the black hole .",
    "( in these coordinates the event horizon is always located at @xmath7 while the time coordinate is taken from the cylindrical patch so that data on all grids are simultaneous . )",
    "the inner boundary of the spherical grid , located at or within the event horizon , is a simple outflow boundary , and requires no boundary condition .",
    "the cylindrical domain has an inner boundary somewhere near the black hole , whether inside or outside of the horizon is immaterial , as long as it is covered by the spherical coordinate patch .",
    "an exchange of information between the two coordinate patches is required to provide boundary conditions at the inner cylindrical boundary and the outer spherical boundary .    on each grid",
    "the discrete system is constructed using the energy method  @xcite .",
    "we define an energy for the semi - discrete system and , using difference operators that satisfy summation by parts , we obtain a discrete energy estimate  @xcite .",
    "well - posed boundary conditions can then be identified by controlling the boundary terms of the discrete energy estimate .",
    "the conditions are discretized using olsson s projection method  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the symmetry axis ( @xmath8 in canonical cylindrical coordinates ) is included in the discrete energy estimate  @xcite , allowing us to naturally obtain a stable discretization for axisymmetric systems .",
    "we implement our excision algorithm using overlapping grids , also known as composite mesh difference method  @xcite .",
    "the two grids are coupled by interpolation , which is done for all the components of the fields being evolved .",
    "if the system is hyperbolic this means that one is actually over specifying the problem .",
    "however , as it is pointed out in sec .",
    "13.4 of @xcite and as it is confirmed by our experiments , this does not lead to a numerical instability .",
    "the fully discretized system is completed by integrating the semi - discrete equations with an appropriate method for odes ; we choose third and fourth order runge - kutta , which does not spoil the energy estimate of the semi - discrete system  @xcite .",
    "kreiss - oliger dissipation  @xcite is added to the scheme , as some explicit dissipation is generally necessary for stability with overlapping grids  @xcite . whereas the stability theory for overlapping grids for elliptic problems is well developed",
    ", there are very few results concerning hyperbolic systems .",
    "starius presents a stability proof for overlapping grids in one dimension  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that thornburg has also explored multiple grids in the context of numerical relativity with black hole excision  @xcite .",
    "the structure of the overlapping grids used in this work is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : overlapping ] .",
    "the additional complication of the axis of symmetry is discussed below . for simplicity",
    "we choose the outer boundary to be of rectangular shape .",
    "the introduction of a smooth spherical outer boundary , along with another grid overlapping with the base cylindrical grid , is certainly possible and , we believe , likely to improve the absorbing character of the outer boundary when the incoming fields are set to zero .",
    "to demonstrate our excision algorithm , we choose the evolution of a massless klein - gordon scalar field on an axisymmetric , boosted schwarzschild background as a model problem . in this section",

    "the specification of proper boundary conditions requires careful consideration in order to achieve a well - posed ibvp , and we use the energy method to identify appropriate boundary conditions  @xcite . here one defines the energy of the system at time @xmath42 to be @xmath43 where @xmath36 is some positive definite @xmath17 symmetric matrix and @xmath44 denotes the transpose of @xmath18 . to ensure continuous dependence of the solution on the initial and boundary data ,",
    "the energy must be bounded in terms of appropriate norms of the data . to determine this bound one usually takes a time derivative of the energy ( [ eq : energy ] ) , with the further assumptions that @xmath18 is a smooth solution of ( [ eq : fosh ] ) and that @xmath36 is a symmetrizer .",
    "the energy estimate is then @xmath45 where gauss theorem was used to obtain the boundary term , and @xmath46 is the outward unit normal to the boundary @xmath6 . to control the growth of the energy of the solution , we naturally need to control both the boundary and volume integrals .",

    "we see that prescribing homogeneous boundary conditions ( @xmath57 , with @xmath58 sufficiently small , i.e. ,  @xmath59 ) , ensures that the boundary term will give a non - positive contribution to the energy estimate .",

    "the second term of the energy estimate ( [ eq : e_dot ] ) , the volume integral , can be estimated by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a constant that does not depend on the solution .",

    "discretizing the spatial derivatives in the right hand side of system ( [ eq : fosh ] ) , but leaving time continuous , leads to a system of odes called the _ semi - discrete system_. if an initial value problem satisfies the estimate @xmath69 at the continuum , it would be desirable to obtain a discretization such that a similar estimate holds at the discrete level .",
    "following @xcite , we will say that a semi - discrete system is _ strictly stable _ if @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 is a discrete energy consistent with the one of the continuum .",
    "clearly , the requirement that @xmath73 be symmetric , does not uniquely determine the symmetrizer .",
    "for example , if @xmath36 is a symmetrizer , then @xmath74 with @xmath75 is also a symmetrizer . in some circumstances , as for the scalar field considered here , it is possible to select a preferred symmetrizer which satisfies the additional requirement @xmath76 when this condition holds , the energy defined by that symmetrizer will be conserved . by this",
    "we mean that the change in energy of our system is solely due to the boundary term of ( [ eq : e_dot ] ) , which can be controlled by using maximal dissipative boundary conditions ( [ eq : maxdissip ] ) .",
    "in particular , when homogeneous boundary conditions are used , or when no boundaries are present , the energy can not increase .      let us assume momentarily that that there exists a symmetrizer for which eq .",

    "any semi - discrete approximation that preserves the discrete energy ( [ eq : disce ] ) is an _ energy conserving _ scheme .",
    "remarkably , whenever a system admits a conserved energy at the continuum it is always possible to construct an energy conserving scheme  @xcite .",
    "the following `` @xmath85 '' splitting , for example , @xmath86 ensures that the discrete energy ( [ eq : disce ] ) remains constant . clearly , an energy conserving scheme is strictly stable , since @xmath87 .",
    "we note that , depending on the problem , there may be alternative , simpler discretizations than the `` @xmath85 '' splitting which lead to the same energy estimate .",

    "systems with moving boundaries arise in a variety of situations , and their solution typically involves introducing coordinates adapted to the boundaries",
    ". these may be either a single , global coordinate system , such as those used in binary black hole evolutions  @xcite that keep the black holes and the outer boundary at fixed coordinate positions , or , as advocated here , multiple coordinate patches .",
    "whichever approach is adopted , fixing coordinates to the boundaries allows one to unambiguously specify proper boundary conditions , as required for well - posed problems .",
    "moreover , boundaries at fixed grid coordinates eliminate the need for extrapolated data at points that emerge from a moving boundary .    in our model problem",
    "we have evolved an axisymmetric scalar field on a boosted schwarzschild background .",
    "we used a cylindrical coordinate patch with respect to which the outer boundary is fixed , and we introduced an overlapping spherical coordinate patch co - moving with the hole . at any given time in the co - moving coordinate system",
    "the location of the inner boundary ( the horizon ) corresponds to a @xmath444 surface .",
    "this surface can be represented exactly on the numerical grid and allows one to smoothly excise a large volume of spacetime , much larger than that permitted by cubical excision .",
    "our numerical implementation made use of overlapping grids , where different but equivalent problems are solved on separate grids . to communicate data between grids we used interpolation on all fields .",
    "the discrete version of the energy method , based on differencing operators that satisfy the summation by parts property , has demonstrated to be particularly effective for the construction of a stable discretization scheme on the axis of symmetry , and for the identification of discrete boundary conditions .",
    "the stability proofs , which hold on individual grids , can not be immediately extended to the overlapping grid scheme , due to the interpolation of data from one grid to another .",
    "we note , however , that it may be possible to define orthogonal projection operators for the interpolation that could allow to analytically demonstrate numerical stability  @xcite .",
    "this is a question of active interest .",
    "nevertheless , our numerical tests indicate that our scheme is convergent , even for very high values of the boost parameter , and does not suffer from long term power - law or exponential growth in the error .",
    "the model problem that we presented in this work is primarily intended as a proof of concept , and several avenues of research remain to be explored .",
    "foremost might be the addition of the einstein equations to the system for a dynamic black - hole spacetime , where the locations of the black hole singularity and event horizon are not a priori known .",
    "depending on the dimensionality of the problem , one or more coordinate patches adapted to the inner boundary would have to be generated during evolution , along with the relationship between the various coordinate systems . by monitoring the characteristic speeds on the excision boundary ( with respect to the coordinate system adapted to that boundary )",
    ", one can guarantee its purely outflow properties , an essential requirement of excision .",
    "although alternative numerical approaches may be possible , the overlapping grid method has struck us for its strength and its simplicity .",
    "owing to its flexibility in representing smooth , time dependent boundaries , we believe that this technique , or a similar one , will play a significant role in the solution of the binary black hole problem .",
    "we thank olivier sarbach for many valuable discussions during this work , and for sharing early results on summation by parts for the two dimensional wave equation in axisymmetry .",

    "to gain some insight into the limitations of cubical excision and the consequent need for a smooth excision boundary , we consider the analytic schwarzschild and kerr solutions  @xcite .",

    "schild coordinates , which are smooth across the horizon , and write the metric as @xmath445 where @xmath446 is the minkowski metric , @xmath36 is a scalar , @xmath447 and @xmath448 is a null vector , @xmath449 the parameter @xmath450 represents the mass of the black hole and @xmath451 is the total angular momentum .",

    "( see description in text . )",
    "values of @xmath456 for which an inner boundary has no incoming modes , and thus a candidate for an excision boundary , are indicated by the shaded region in the figure .",
    "the structure of the kerr spacetime results in both maximum and minimum limits to the size of the excision cube .",
    "we find that , in this particular coordinate system , cubical excision for kerr is well - defined only for very small spin parameters , @xmath457 , where @xmath458 . for values of @xmath456 below the dashed line",

    ", we must ensure that its boundary is purely outflow , i.e. , that no information can enter the computational domain . to determine the allowed values of @xmath456",
    ", we calculate the characteristic speeds on each face of the cube and check that the inequality @xmath461 , where @xmath54 is the outward unit normal to the boundary , is satisfied .",
    "the schwarzschild solution is obtained by setting @xmath462 , and the calculation gives  @xcite @xmath463 .",
    "the calculations for kerr ( @xmath464 ) are more involved , and we present our numerically generated results in fig .  [",
    "fig : kerr_cubical_excision ] .",
    "we find that because of the ring singularity ( @xmath465 , @xmath466 ) , in addition to a maximum size for the excision cube , there is also a _ minimum _ size .",
    "in addition , we notice that no cubical excision is possible for @xmath467 .",
    "this is a severe constraint on the spin parameter , and precludes cubical excision for interesting values of spin .",
    "we note , however , that this limitation is coordinate dependent and that it might be possible to choose coordinates in which cubical excision may be done for higher values of @xmath468 .",
