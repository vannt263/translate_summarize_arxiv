    "in crystalline solids , configurational energetics as well as other physical quantities including elastic modulus , adsorption energy and vibrational free energy can be quantitatively treated by a generalized ising model ( gim ) , which can be smoothly combined with _",
    "ab initio _ calculations .",
    "the gim can give complete orthonormal basis functions to represent all possible microscopic states on given lattice in configuration space , and enables to completely treat physical quantities as a linear map for the microscopic states .",
    "based on gim , we recently developed a theory , enabling to characterize physical properties of crystalline solids and their temperature dependences in equilibrium state , by using a few specially - selected microscopic states that are _ independent _ of constituent elements , multibody interactions and temperature.@xcite these special states are naturally derived by clarifying how macroscopic physical property connect with spatial constraint on the system .",
    "these important facts rely on the fact that statistical interdependence for density of microscopic states on configuration space become numerically vanished at thermodynamic limit for a wide class of spatial constraint , which has been confirmed based on the theory of random matrix with gaussian orthogonal ensemble.our results strongly indicate that information of spatial constraint on the system should be carefully re - examined , especially how the geometrical characteristics of microscopic states on configuration space is restricted by various condition of constraints .",
    "our previous studies focus on microscopic states on configuration space as a member of vector space constructed by taking tensor product over that for whole lattice points , while other aspect , especially , role of the spatial constraint on low dimensional topology of the structures themselves and corresponding statistical interdependence are not explicitly examined .",
    "such information should be of great importance to further address physical properties that do not simply corresponds to linear map with respect to microscopic states on configuration space , including diffusion and deformation behavior for crystalline solids .",
    "it is thus naturally desired to develop unified representation to simultaneously treat convensional and topological description of structures for further studying the relationship between spatial constraint and macroscopic properties .",
    "based on the graph theory , the present study proposes construction of graph laplacians ( and their adjacency matrix ) for configurational properties of crystalline solids by a natural extention of gim , where landscape of their spectrum explicitly contains both gim and topological description of the microscopic structures : crystal structures can be considered as linear combination of multiple graph spectrum .",
    "based on the proposed representation , we demonstrate practical examples of finding characteristic microscopic structures beyond gim description , and also address statistical interdependence for microscopic structures including gim and graph energy descriptions .",
    "let us first consider a given lattice @xmath0 , composed of @xmath1 lattice points indexed by @xmath2 .",
    "gim typically employs complete orthonormal ( but orthonormality is not always required ) basis functions ( cons ) of vector space @xmath3 for the system , @xmath4s , by taking a tensor product of vector space on individual lattice points , which is constructed by applying gram - schmidt technique to linearly - independent polynomial set of spin variables ( specifying occupation of constituents at lattice point @xmath5 ) for @xmath6-compoenent system , @xmath7 : @xmath8 where @xmath9 here , @xmath10 denotes inner product on a given single lattice point considered .",
    "it is clear from the above equations that cons of @xmath11s should have index of both specifying a set of lattice points ( i.e. , `` figure '' ) whose basis function is not unity , @xmath12 , and a set of index of basis function ( i.e. , subscript of @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 : @xmath15 . with these definition ,",
    "any physical quantity @xmath16 as a linear map for microscopic states on lattice , @xmath17 , can always be given by @xmath18 in order to include the information of basis functions for gim in graph theory , we consider a given lattice @xmath0 as a set of graph @xmath19 composed of edges for @xmath6-th symmetry - equivalent pair figure and their constituent vertices",
    ". then we define corresponding graph laplacian @xmath20 as the sum of three contribution , namely , @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 is the diagonal matrix , whose diagonal element @xmath24 is given by @xmath25 note that index set , @xmath26 , includes `` order '' of index : e.g. , when @xmath27 , then @xmath28 .",
    "the sum of @xmath29 is known as adjacent matrix , @xmath30 .",
    "here we consider graph laplacian as symmetric matrix , indicating that whole lattice points on `` empty '' lattice are symmetry - equivalent , which holds for representative lattice including fcc , bcc , hcp and diamond . for simplicity ( without lack of generality )",
    ", hereinafter index @xmath6 includes both figure type @xmath6 and set of basis indices @xmath26 .    from the above definitions",

    "when the dimension of figure , @xmath33 , is four or larger , the situation is different from @xmath56 .",
    "since @xmath33 ( @xmath57 ) walk does not always results in figure with dimension of @xmath33 , such undesired path should be omitted .",

    "we can vanish undesired path to obtain multisite correlation using linear combination of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e. , @xmath60 .",
    "for instance , quartet correlation consisting of four neighboring ( @xmath42 ) and two next neighboring ( @xmath45 ) pairs shown in fig .  [ fig:4mom ] can be given by @xmath61 - \\mathrm{tr}\\left [ \\left(\\bm{a}'_{r } + \\bm{a}'_s\\right)^4 \\right ]     \\right\\ } , \\nonumber \\\\",

    "while the above discussions for representation of configurational properties based on graph theory can be applied for any choice of basis functions in gim , we would first construct gim basis functions so that the resultant laplacian ( and adjacency matrix ) form can be well - transferable to existing graph theory for practical use .",
    "first , since graph laplacian is typically a real matrix , gim basis functions should be non - negative real number .",
    "this can be easily achieved for multicomponent ( including binary ) system , where we employ , for instance , non - orthogonal ( but complete ) basis functions of @xmath66 with non - negative spin variables : these definitions always results in non - negative value of gim basis functions , which is a desired property .",
    "another notation here is that off - diagonal element of adjacent matrix ( or laplacian ) typically takes binary value of 0 or 1 ( -1 ) , in which the theoretical studies have actively been performed so far .",
    "this can also be easily achieved by the present approach for binary system , where we define gim basis function on _ individual _ lattice point as @xmath67 and define spin variables taking 0 and 1 : this satisfies that corresponding off - diagonal elements for adjacent matrix ( graph laplacian ) takes binary value of 0 or 1 ( -1 ) . with this definition ,",
    "topological information for link between one of the two constituents with spin variable of 1 can be extracted from the laplacian . to extract topological information for another constituent ,",
    "we just make opposite definition of spin variables . the proposed representaion to relate gim basis functions with graph spectrum shown above",
    "strongly indicates that again , not only spectrum for a single graph , but also landscape of spectrum for linear combinations of multiple graphs should be of great importance .",
    "( upper ) and @xmath68 ( lower ) for three ordered structures at the vertices of cp shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] and for quasi - random structure . ]",
    "one of such important applications is to examine landscape of the so - called _ configurational polyhedra _",
    "( cp ) , which is a hyperpolyhedra in multidimensional configuration space determining upper and lower value for gim basis functions constrained by a given lattice ( or more generally , spatial constraint ) . in classical systems",
    ", they are always the candidates having maximum or minimum physical quantity such as energy or elastic modulus . with these considerations ,",
    "we first apply the present representation to investigating landscape of cp in terms of the graph spectrum , whick leads to further addressing role of the spatial constraint . since microscopic structure at vertices of cp",
    "is known to be invariant by linear transformation of gim basis functions , constructing cp - like hyperpolyhedron by graph spectrum other than gim information can be of great interest . in the present study , we therefore focus on not only structure information based on gim , but also the sum of absolute of all eigenvalues for graph spectrum , called `` graph energy '' , which has been extensively investigated to characterize such as regularity by determining upper and/or lower bound of its value , and corresponding",
    "application has been done for molecules to relate to its energetics .",
    "we here take examples of all possible atomic configurations on @xmath69 expansion of fcc convensional unit cell having minimal unit consisting of up 16 atoms , and calculate corresponding graph spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig : cp ] shows the resultant cp in terms of ( i ) @xmath70 $ ] for @xmath71 and 2 ( @xmath42 denotes @xmath42-th neighboring coordination ) , and ( ii ) graph energy for @xmath64 and @xmath65 : in the figure , `` rd '' denotes atomic configuration most close to its center of gravity , and atomic configurations at the vertices of cp are also shown .",
    "the left - hand of fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] corresponds to the standard cp in terms of gim basis function , where we can successfully find two ordered structures at the vertices of l1@xmath72 and `` 40 '' that are known to be ground - state atomic configurations for real alloys ( e.g. , l1@xmath72 for cuau and `` 40 '' for ptrh ) .",
    "we also find z2 structure at the vertex , considered as phase separation with interface of ( 100 ) plane , and find two additional structures which we call here `` block '' and `` 2-(110 ) '' .",
    "when we see the right - hand of fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] , several important characteristics are found : ( i ) five atomic configurations at the vertices in left - hand figure are also located at vertices of cp for right - hand figure in terms of graph energy , ( ii ) structures of `` block '' and `` 2-(110 ) '' , which are not distinguished in left - hand figure , can be distinguished for cp of graph energy , ( iii ) three additional characteristic atomic configurations of s1 , s2 and s3 at vertices appears , which can not be achieved by linear transformation of considered gim basis functions , and ( iv ) atomic configuration near the center of gravity in the left - hand figure , `` rd '' , which corresponds to quasi - random structure in terms of pair correlations , also locates near the center of gravity for cp of graph energy .",
    "these results indicate that landscape of the proposed graph spectrum tend to not only retain characteristic structures in terms of gim description ( i.e. , structures at vertices in left - hand cp as well as quasi - random structure ) , but also to find out other characteristic ordered structures .",
    "landscape of the cp , indicated by green solid lines , certainly reflects the class of spatial constraint on the system where near their boundaries , statistical interdependence of density of microscopic states can not be neglected:@xcite landscape of cp for right - hand figure therefore should contain information about another aspect of spatial constraint on the system , which can not be explicitly obtained by gim description .",
    "we should note here that when we simply construct cp in terms of graph energy of a single graph ( i.e. , graph energy for @xmath73 , the resultant cp does not satisfy the above characteristics of ( i ) or ( iii ) , demonstrating that not only a single graph , graph spectrum for their linear combination including negative sum ( e.g. , @xmath65 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] ) should be essentially important to characterize atomic configurations on given lattice , reflecting the role of spatial constraint .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos1 ] density of states ( dos ) for eigenvalues of @xmath64 and @xmath65 for three ordered structures and one quasi - random structure ( i.e. , structure of `` rd '' ) , which are used to constructing cp in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : dos1 ] , we can see that doss for ground - state structures of l1@xmath72 and `` 40 '' are symmetric with respect to zero eigenvalue , while z2 and random structure are asymmetric . within the symmetric dos of l1@xmath72 and `` 40 '' , although their second - order moment exactly takes the same value , their landscape shows clear difference .",
    "such differences certainly results in the difference in graph energy fo @xmath64 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] .",
    "when we consider linear combination , e.g. , @xmath65 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos1 ] , ( i ) such symmetric features of dos for @xmath64 disappears and their landscape tend to become broaden , and ( ii ) similarity in characteristic peaks can be found between @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "these characteristics in graph spectrum certainly results in the fact that cp for graph energies of left - hand of fig .",
    "[ fig : cp ] can exhibit common structures at vertex with convensional cp and also have additional structures at their vertices .     and",
    "@xmath74 for multiple system size .",
    "lower : second , third and fourth order moment for the corresponding density of states as a functin of number of atoms in the system . ]",
    "another important investigation is the characteristics of density of microscopic states on configuration space ( doms ) near its center of gravity for _ non - interacting _ system . in our previous theory , we find that equilibrium properties ( especially , free energy and structure ) and their temperature dependence can be well characterized by a single special microscopic state that can be known a priori when spatial constraint is given .",
    "this is derived based on the fact that doms ( i.e. , using linear combination of @xmath75$]s ) for _ non - interacting _ system can be well - characterized by multidimensional gaussian distribution , and that near the center of gravity of density of microscopic states on configuration space , statistical interdependence for structural degree of freedom can be numerically vanished at thermodynamic limit . since function form for the gaussian is invariant to linear transformation of the coordinates , interesting characteristics other than such transformation would lie under the statistical interdependence for density of states in terms of combination of gim description of structure with other description , e.g. , graph energy .",
    "we here consider doms for fcc conventional cell at equiatomic composition with different system size of 32 , 108 , 256 and 320 atoms , where individual atomic configuration is uniformly sampled based on monte carlo simulation with totally 102400 steps.@xcite to construct dosm , we prepare two systems : one is four dimensional space of @xmath76 $ ] @xmath77 , and another is also four dimensinal space of @xmath76 $ ] @xmath78 and graph energy for @xmath79 . to see the statistical interdependence",
    ", we compare the density of states of covariance matrix for the above four dimensional domss ( hereinafter we describe as @xmath80 and @xmath74 ) , with that for random matrix with gaussian orthogonal ensemble : details for the present approach based on random matrix is described in our previous paper.@xcite in brief , we numerically construct @xmath81 random matrix and estimating corresponding covariance matrix and their eigenvalues .",
    "figure  [ fig : doms ] show the resultant density of states and @xmath82-th order moment ( @xmath83 ) , as a function of number of atoms in the system .",
    "we can clearly see that landscape of density of states for @xmath80 qualitatively become close to that for random matrix when system size increases , which also holds for the system including information about graph energy , @xmath74 : the former tendency has been confirmed by our previous study.@xcite this tendency can be quantitatively seen for the system size dependence of @xmath82-th order moment , where each moment gradually become close to that for random matrix with increase of system size .",
    "these results strongly indicate that our previously developed approach to determine equilibrium properties based on the information of spatial constraint can be extended to describing topological aspect of structures , by using the proposed representation of structures based on graph theory .",
