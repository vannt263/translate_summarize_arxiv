    "the c - axis transport in the highly anisotropic cuprate - superconductors @xmath2 ( tbcco ) and @xmath3 ( bscco ) can well be described by a model where the superconducting cuo@xmath4 layers are coupled by tunneling barriers forming a stack of josephson junctions @xcite .",
    "subgap structures @xcite in the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristics could be explained by the excitation of longitudinal c - axis phonons by the josephson oscillations in resistive junctions @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite a microscopic theory for the coupling between josephson oscillations and phonons has been derived for the case of a short stack of josephson junctions where it can be assumed that the gauge - invariant phase difference @xmath5 between superconducting layers @xmath6 and @xmath7 is constant along the layers ( independent of @xmath8 ) . in the simplest model",
    "the tunneling current through a junction @xmath6 is relatexd the bias current density @xmath9 by the rsj equation @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the average electric field across the junction which is related to the phase difference @xmath12 by the second josephson equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the thickness of the barrier .",
    "@xmath15 is the field generated by the oscillating conduction electron charges on the cuo@xmath4 layers .",
    "it can be expressed by the average field in the barrier and the ionic polarization , @xmath16 .",
    "the polarization @xmath17 is proportional to the lattice displacements of ions .",
    "phonons are excited by the field of the oscillating electronic charges on the cuo@xmath4 layers .",
    "the field @xmath18 can be expressed by a generalized dielectric function @xmath19 of the form @xmath20    here @xmath21 are the eigenfrequencies of the dynamical matrix ( including long - range coulomb forces ) .",
    "the oscillator strength @xmath22 takes care of the fact that ions inside the barrier and on the cuo@xmath4 layers are excited by different fields and have to be counted differently in the polarization in the rsj - equation ( [ rsj ] ) .",
    "the dielectric function has zeros at the frequencies of longitudinal c - axis phonons .",
    "it can also be written in the more common form @xmath23 where we have included a background dk .",
    "the frequencies @xmath24 where the dielectric function has poles can also be calculated from a dynamical matrix where long - range coulomb forces have been subtracted . in the limit @xmath25 they correspond to the transversal optical eigenfrequencies of the system .    in the resistive state",
    "the phase difference of barrier @xmath6 has the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 oscillates with the same josephson frequency @xmath28 , while for a barrier in the superconducting state the term @xmath29 is missing .",
    "inserting this ansatz in the rsj equations we can solve for the dc part and the oscillating part . in the special case where only one junction of the stack is in the resistive state we obtain for the normalized dc - current @xmath30 as function of the dc - voltage @xmath31 : @xmath32 here @xmath33 is an averaged phonon dielectric function defined by @xmath34 @xmath35 here @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the bare josephson plasma frequency . in the case of a dispersionless phonon",
    "we just have @xmath38 .    in the general case",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve shows peaks at the zeros of the real part of @xmath39 corresponding to c - axis phonons with a high density of states and non - vanishing oscillator strength @xmath40 . besides optical @xmath41-point phonons also phonons from the edge of the brillouin zone at @xmath42 and even acoustical phonons may contribute to phonon resonances in the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves @xcite .",
    "the coupling to an acoustical phonon at @xmath42 may explain a resonance observed for tbcco at 3.2 mv by seidel et al .",
    "@xcite at a frequency / voltage which is lower then any optical phonon branch expected from model calculations",
    ". a fit to the experimental data can be made with reasonable values of the oscillator strength and phonon damping which are compatible with optical experiments .",
    "also a double peak structure found in bscco @xcite may be due to the coupling to one optical branch with two van hove singularities at @xmath43 and @xmath42 .",
    "the dispersion of phonons also leads to a coupling ( phase - locking ) of josephson oscillations in different resistive junctions @xcite .",
    "a phase - locking in a stack of josephson junctions is important for applications of such systems as high - frequency mixers and detectors .",
    "in the case of long junctions and in the presence of an external magnetic field applied parallel to the layers we have to account for the variation of the phase @xmath44 along the layers ( x - direction ) .",
    "the result is a generalization of the coupled sine - gordon equations derived in @xcite : @xmath45 @xmath46 the characteristic lengths for the variation of the phase along the layers are calculated from @xmath47 where @xmath48 , @xmath49 are the penetration depths of magnetic fields polarized in c - direction and parallel to the ab - planes , respectively . they are related to the corresponding plasma frequencies @xmath50 , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the velocity of light . for bscco realistic values",
    "are @xmath53 nm , @xmath54 nm , @xmath55 m , which gives a josephson penetration depth of @xmath56 m .    in the derivation of eq . ( [ sinegordon ] ) terms of the form @xmath57 , which are small compared to @xmath58 for the frequency range considered , have been neglected . furthermore in the coupling to phonons only polarization effects with polarization in c - direction excited by fields in c - direction ( expressed by the dielectric function @xmath59 ) have been taken into account .",
    "it can be shown @xcite , that the neglect of other polarizations is a good approximation for wave - vectors with @xmath60 , which is well fulfilled for @xmath61 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath62 is not small and @xmath63 in general .    in the following numerical calculations we consider only local polarization effects ,",
    "i.e. we neglect the dispersion of phonons",
    ". this will be sufficient to demonstrate the principle effects .      assuming a stack with @xmath64 josephson barriers with @xmath65 superconducting layers and two normal contacts @xmath66 this set of equations ( [ sinegordon ] ) holds for @xmath67 .",
    "in the barriers connecting the superconducting layers with the normal contact @xmath68 has to be replaced by the normalized bias current @xmath69 . it is useful to incorporate this boundary condition into the set of equations by subtracting @xmath70 for each term writing @xmath71 then @xmath72 which has to be solved with the boundary conditions @xmath73 for @xmath74 for a finite stack .    the magnetic field ( in y - direction ) which causes the variation of the phase along the layers enters explicitly the boundary condition for @xmath75 at the edges of the stack .",
    "it consists of the external field @xmath76 and the field generated by the bias current .",
    "if we neglect the latter we have @xmath77 and we may drop the small contribution @xmath78 on the left side of eq . ( [ sinegordon2 ] ) . then in the case of a constant phase along the layers one recovers the rsj equation @xmath73 .",
    "the set of coupled sine - gordon equations can be solved numerically . here",
    "one makes the general ansatz for the phases in the different layers : @xmath79 using a fourier expansion for the spatially oscillating part of the phases and splitting off the term @xmath80 which takes care of the average increase of the phase difference due to the applied magnetic field . with help of this",
    "ansatz a coupled set of differential equations for the components @xmath81 can be derived and solved with runge - kutta techniques .",
    "approximate analytical solutions are possible by setting @xmath82 and linearizing the equations ( [ sinegordon ] ) with respect to small oscillating terms @xmath83 .",
    "this ansatz is well justified for large magnetic fields where the magnetic flux penetrates the stack almost homogeneously .",
    "therefore there is a voltage drop @xmath84 over each junction .",
    "the oscillating part describes standing waves which oscillate primarily with the same basic josephson frequency @xmath28 .    using in addition a fourier expansion of the oscillating parts in c - direction and keeping only the lowest harmonics in @xmath28 we arrive at the following expression for the dc - current @xmath85 with @xmath86 where the sum goes over the discrete values of @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 .",
    "the denominator contains the phonon dielectric function and the characteristic velocity @xmath90 resonances are expected at frequencies where the real part of the denominator vanishes .",
    "there size depends on the weighting functions @xmath91 which contains a fourier transformation of the static phase distribution and the function @xmath92 depending on the magnetic field , which is peaked at @xmath93 .",
    "for a single contact , @xmath94 , the value of @xmath62 is fixed to @xmath95 .",
    "then the characteristic ( swihart- ) velocity is @xmath96 , and the resonance frequencies in the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve are determined from @xmath97=0.\\ ] ] for a constant @xmath98 structures appear in the current - voltage characteristic at @xmath99 .",
    "these are the well - known fiske steps @xcite .",
    "they correspond to the excitation of standing electromagnetic waves in the josephson junction of length @xmath100 .",
    "the largest amplitude is obtained for wave - vectors @xmath101 . here",
    "the velocity of fluxons equals the phase velocity of the electromagnetic waves . in the case of a very long junction",
    "the fiske steps merge into one flux flow branch which is peaked at @xmath102 ( eck - peak @xcite ) .    in order to discuss the influence of phonons we use here for simplicity a dispersionless optical phonon band with the dielectric function @xmath103 the spectrum of resonances as function of the discrete values of @xmath104",
    "is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "one obtains two branches : for small @xmath105-values the lower branch corresponds to the propagation of electromagnetic waves , while the upper branch is phonon - like .",
    "the lower branch ends at the ( transverse ) phonon eigenfrequency @xmath106 .",
    "the upper branch starts at the zero of the dielectric function , i.e. at the longitudinal eigenfrequency @xmath107 .",
    "the parameters used to calculate the dispersion shown in fig .  1 are adapted to tbcco .    in fig .",
    "2 the result for the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve is shown for three different magnetic fields .",
    "the figures compare numerical ( runge - kutta ) with analytical results .",
    "note that the magnetic field selects the @xmath105-value where the strongest resonance occurs : @xmath108 . in order to show the phonon effects more clearly",
    "a large separation between @xmath106 and @xmath109 has been chosen .",
    "furthermore for numerical reasons a comparatively small value of the mccumber parameter @xmath110 has been used , while @xmath111 would be more realistic ( @xmath112 with @xmath113 ) .    for @xmath114",
    "only one resonance occurs at @xmath107 corresponding to the subgap - resonance discussed in sec.[sec : excit - phon - josephs ] . for finite @xmath115",
    "one finds two groups of resonances corresponding to the two branches in fig .  1 .",
    "the fine - structure is due to fiske - resonances in the stack of finite length @xmath100 . with increasing field strength the upper peak shifts to higher frequencies .",
    "the lower peak approaches the to - frequency while loosing weight . in all cases there",
    "is a gap with no resonances for frequencies between @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "generally the agreement between numerical and analytical calculations is good , in particular , concerning the position of peaks .",
    "the agreement in the height of the peaks can be improved by going beyond the linear approximation in the oscillation amplitudes .",
    "the numerical calculations show the same hysteretic behavior as the experimental results if the bias current density is changed .",
    "numerical calculations can also be performed for larger stacks .",
    "analytical calculations are no longer possible for @xmath116 without further assumptions on the relative phases @xmath117 for the different junctions . in fig .",
    "3 we show results for the positions of the resonances for a stack with @xmath118 junctions for all possible values of @xmath119 .",
    "the multiple branches correspond to different values of the characteristic velocity @xmath120 which depends strongly on @xmath62 .    in fig .",
    "4 we show results for the @xmath0-@xmath1 curve for a large applied magnetic field . here",
    "we find a vortex lattice which is moving due to the bias current .",
    "both numerical and analytical results are shown as function of frequency which corresponds to the dc - voltage drop over a single junction . for our analytical calculations of the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves",
    "we have superimposed results calculated with all possible values of @xmath62 .",
    "the comparison with numerical results in fig .",
    "4 demonstrates that modes with all possible @xmath62-values will be excited by cycling the bias current .",
    "the group of peaks at the highest frequency correspond to electromagnetic modes with the smallest @xmath62 value .",
    "the middle group contains phonon like excitations while the lowest group are electromagnetic excitations of kleiner modes . again",
    "a gap appears between @xmath106 and @xmath107 in accordance with the dispersion curves in fig .",
    "the main results of the preceding section are : a ) a shift of phonon resonances in a parallel magnetic field , b ) fiske resonances in the frequency range of phonons are no longer equidistant , c ) the flux - flow voltage is no longer proportional to the magnetic field and has a gap between @xmath121 and @xmath107 . in order to observe these effects experimentally a strong magnetic field has to be applied ( @xmath122 t ) . in most experiments @xcite the applied field has been much lower , and no shift of phonon resonances has been observed .",
    "a further requirement is that the field is applied strictly parallel to the layers in order to avoid vortex pinning from inhomogeneities .",
    "the fact that in the cited experiments @xcite neither fiske resonances in the frequency range of phonons nor a flux flow branch could be observed is an indication of vortex pinning .",
    "recently the flux flow voltage has been measured for a stack of 30 junctions in bscco @xcite .",
    "deviations from the linear field dependence together with anomalies in the frequency range of an optical phonon have been observed , which supports the present model for the interaction between flux flow and phonons .",
