    "the fraction of primaries in the track sample at a given @xmath0  bin was estimated from data by fitting the @xmath6  distribution with three monte carlo templates : primary particles , secondaries from material and secondaries from weak decays @xcite .",

    "spectra measured at the lhc are compared with rhic results for  collisions at @xmath1  = 200 gev ( black - empty markers ) .",
    "the spectral shape is significantly harder at the lhc with respect to rhic .",

    "the @xmath0  ranges used in the fit are 0.5 - 1  @xmath9 , 0.2 - 1.5  @xmath9 , 0.3 - 3  @xmath9  for @xmath8 , k and p. data are well described by the blast wave function with @xmath7  = 0.65 @xmath10 0.02 and @xmath5  = 95 @xmath10 10 mev .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath5  is sensitive to the pion fit range ( due to large contribution from resonances ) while @xmath7  does not strongly depend on the @xmath0  range used in the fit .",
    "a similar fit to central  collisions at @xmath1  = 200 gev was performed in @xcite : the @xmath7  is @xmath11  10% larger at the lhc with respect to rhic and @xmath5  is compatible within errors . the comparison with predictions ( see @xcite for details ) seems to suggest that hydrodynamic models with a refined late fireball description are able to reproduce the measured @xmath0  spectra at the lhc .    in order to further investigate the hydrodynamic behaviour of the hadron production two of the main features of hydrodynamics",

    "was presented for the first time during this conference in @xcite .",
    "one way to do this is using the vzero  detector to calculate the flow vector @xmath12 on an event - by - event basis , a 2d vector with components @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where the sum @xmath15  runs over all the channels of the vzero  detector , @xmath16 is the multiplicity of channel @xmath15  and @xmath17  is the angle of channel @xmath15 .",
    "the module of the @xmath12 vector is normalized by the multiplicity @xmath18 in the vzero : @xmath19 .",
    "in @xcite it has been shown that the sample with large ( small ) @xmath20 shows a significantly larger ( smaller ) @xmath21 with respect to the unbiased sample and that the non - flow contributions are negligible .",
    "systematic checks show that this selection does not introduce trivial biases related with multiplicity shift or jet contribution .",
    "a modification of the @xmath0  spectrum in semi - central ( 30 - 40% )  collisions at @xmath1  = 2.76 tev in the intermediate @xmath0  region ( from @xmath11 1 up to @xmath11 5 @xmath9 ) is observed , when events are selected according to the event shape engineering ( figure [ fig : spectra - central ] , right ) : higher ( lower ) @xmath21 means harder ( softer ) spectra .",
    "this modification vanishes at high @xmath0  supporting a correlation related with hydrodynamics rather than with hard processes .",
    "a hint of mass ordering can be observed in the region between @xmath11 1 up to @xmath11 3 @xmath9 . a more detailed study ( including comparison with models and hydrodynamic fit of particle spectra )",
    "will allow to better understand the observed correlation between @xmath21 and radial flow .",
    "the thermal description of hadron production was found to be successful over a broad range of energies ( from @xmath1  = 2 gev to @xmath1  = 200 gev @xcite ) .",
    "there are only these three parameters which govern the thermal model : the chemical freezeout temperature @xmath22 , the baryon - chemical potential @xmath23  and the volume @xmath24 . in order to extract the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23  and @xmath24  a thermal fit @xcite of integrated yields at midrapidity d@xmath25/d@xmath26  in central ( 0 - 20% )  collisions was performed .",
    "it is reported in figure [ fig : yields ] ( left ) .",
    "results from strange and multi - strange particle analyses @xcite are also included in the fit .",
    "the antibaryon over baryon ratios suggest a vanishing baryon - chemical potential at the lhc : for this reason @xmath23  is fixed to 1 mev in the fit .",

    "[ fig : yields ] ( left ) it is possible to see some tension between the data and the fit especially for strange and multi - strange particles .",
    "this is reflected also in the large value of the @xmath29 = 39.6/9 .",
    "the comparison of integrated yields relative to pions ( figure [ fig : yields ] , right ) with rhic hints to decreasing ratios at the lhc , especially for what concerns p/@xmath8 and @xmath30/@xmath8 .",

    "@xmath22  = 164 mev seems to reproduce the multi - strange ratios quite well , but some discrepancy is observed for p/@xmath8 and @xmath30/@xmath8 . on the other hand the model prediction using @xmath22  = 152 mev obtained from the fit is closer to the measured p/@xmath8 and @xmath30/@xmath8 ratios but it misses ratios involving multi - strange hadrons . it has already been pointed out that interactions in the hadronic phase , in particular via the large cross section channel for antibaryon - baryon annihilation , could explain the significant deviation from the usual thermal ratios @xcite .",
    "@xmath0  distributions of @xmath8 , k , p in central ( 0 - 5% )  collisions at the lhc are harder than previously measured at rhic .",
    "they are well described by hydrodynamic models including a refined description of the late fireball stages .",

    "event shape engineering is a powerful tool to select events with different values of the elliptic flow based on the magnitude of the flow vector @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath0  distributions of @xmath8 , k , p in semi - central ( 30 - 40% )  collisions show a correlation between radial flow and elliptic flow : high ( low ) elliptic flow events mean harder ( softer ) spectra .    in central ( 0 - 20% )  collisions at @xmath1  = 2.76 tev a significant deviation from the usual thermal production is observed , especially for p and @xmath30 . the temperature obtained from thermal fit to integrated yields at mid - rapidity d@xmath25/d@xmath26  is lower than expected from previous experiments .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained in terms of interaction in the hadronic phase which can modify the relative hadron abundances .",
    "it should be noted that a refined description of the hadronic phase is also needed to reproduce femtoscopy correlations at the lhc @xcite .    identified hadron results at the lhc cast a new light upon the hydrodynamic and thermal behavior of the hadron production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the p - a run expected at the lhc at the beginning of 2013 , together with the continuously improving experimental precision and description from the theory , will provide further insights ( and model constraints ) on the heavy - ion puzzle .",
