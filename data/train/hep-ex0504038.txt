    "the possible discovery of an exotic baryon with at least five constituent quarks in @xmath2n reactions at low energies  @xcite has initiated a very active search for these so - called pentaquark states . up to now ,",
    "twelve experiments  [ 1 - 12 ] have reported evidence for a narrow resonance with a mass near to 1540   decaying into   or   final states .",
    "in contrast to this , the higher mass states  @xcite and  @xcite were each observed by only one experiment .    however , despite all these experimental data , this subject remains controversial because an increasing amount of experiments report negative results on searches for these states  [ 15 - 27 ] .",
    "furthermore , the masses of the  candidates show a large and systematic spread . for recent reviews of the experimental situation see  @xcite and references therein .",
    "hera - b is a fixed - target experiment which studies collisions of protons with the nuclei of atoms in target wires positioned in the halo of hera s 920 gev proton beam .    the large acceptance of the hera - b spectrometer coupled with high - granularity particle - identification devices and a precision vertex detector allow for detailed studies of complex multi - particle final states .",
    "[ fig : layout ] shows a plan view of the detector in the configuration of the 2002 - 2003 data run .    for this analysis  @xcite the information from the silicon vertex detector , the main tracking system , the ring - imaging cherenkov counter and the electromagnetic calorimeter was used .",
    "a data sample of @xmath0 minimum bias events was recorded at  = 41.6  gev using target wires of different materials ( carbon , titanium and tungsten ) .    applying soft vertex cuts , signals from ,   and",

    "@xmath3 ambiguities are rejected .",
    "selecting @xmath4 s by an invariant mass cut of 3@xmath5 around the peak value and requesting the @xmath6 vertex to be at least 2.5  cm downstream of the target , we obtain clean signals of   and charge conjugated ( c.c . )",

    "in conclusion , hera - b has found no evidence for narrow pentaquarks decaying into  or   final states .",
    "we have set upper limits at 95@xmath7 cl on the production cross sections  at mid - rapidity assuming the width of these states to be less than our experimental resolution of @xmath85  .",
    "searching the full data sample for   decays , the limit varies from 4 to 16  @xmath9b / nucleon for a mass between 1521 and 1555  . assuming comparable production mechanisms , our limits of @xmath10 0.92@xmath7 and @xmath11 2.7@xmath7 contradict the results of zeus and hermes experiments , respectively . analyzing the @xmath12 channels , we determine upper limits   for   pentaquark candidates . combining all three data samples , we obtain for a narrow resonance at a mass of 1862  , 2.7 , 3.2 , 0.94 and 3.1  @xmath9b / nucleon for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 final states , respectively . the upper limit ( 95@xmath7 ) on the cross section ratio @xmath17 of 0.04/@xmath18 is inconsistent with the evidence published by na49 for such a resonance .",
