    "an important difference is , however , that in the present context we are not in the position to exploit an orthogonality structure . instead , the idea behind the methods below is to employ a connection with the ( inverse ) scattering theory of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation with pschl - teller potential @xcite , which reveals that the integral - degree associated legendre functions correspond to reflectionless wave functions that can be expressed in terms of the tau functions of the korteweg - de vries hierarchy @xcite .",
