    "the electron * n*eutrino * c*apture from a nucleus @xmath1 which spontaneously decays via * b*eta decay to a daughter nucleus @xmath2 ( in the following ncb ) @xmath3 shows the remarkable property that it has no energy threshold on the value of the incoming neutrino energy . in the limit of vanishing value for neutrino mass @xmath4 and energy the neutrino contributes to ( [ main ] ) uniquely via its lepton flavor quantum number and in this case the electron in the final state has exactly the @xmath0 decay endpoint energy @xmath5 .",
    "however , for finite @xmath4 the electron kinetic energy is @xmath6 , while electrons emerging from the corresponding @xmath0 decay has at most an energy @xmath7 , neglecting nucleus recoil energy .",
    "the idea of using ncb to measure the cosmological relic neutrino background predicted in the framework of the hot big bang model was already suggested many years ago in @xcite .",
    "the original idea was that if relic neutrinos have a large chemical potential @xmath8 , the electron ( positron ) energy spectrum for @xmath0 decays and ncb would get quite a typical signature in a interval of order @xmath8 around the zero neutrino mass endpoint @xmath5 .",
    "however , big bang nucleosynthesis constrains relic neutrino ",
    "antineutrino asymmetry to the small value @xmath9 , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this implies that , unless more exotic scenarios are considered , as a larger amount of relativistic degrees of freedom in the early universe , the effect of neutrino degeneracy in @xmath0 decays and ncb is too small to be detected experimentally .",
    "however , for massive neutrinos a gap around @xmath5 is expected of the order of twice the neutrino mass , which for @xmath10 ev is several orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding effect due to neutrino - antineutrino asymmetry . at least in principle",
    ", this allows to distinguish between @xmath0 decay and ncb interaction . in this paper",
    "we briefly summarize the results of @xcite where it is argued that if @xmath4 is in the ev range , future ncb experiments could represent an almost unique way to detect cosmological neutrinos .",
    "assuming an isotropic neutrino flux corresponding to a distribution function in phase space @xmath11 , the ncb integrated rate can be expressed as an integral over the electron ( positron ) energy @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermi function , with @xmath14 and @xmath15 the energy and momentum of the outgoing electron and @xmath16 the corresponding @xmath0 decay endpoint .",
    "the rate contains the nuclear shape factor @xmath17 , an angular momentum weighted average of nuclear state transition amplitudes , which depends upon the nuclear properties of the parent and daughter nuclei and represents the main source of uncertainty in @xmath18 , the product of the cross section times neutrino velocity .    on the other hand , ncb rate is strongly related to the corresponding @xmath0 decay process rate @xmath19 where a simple relation between the two shape factors holds @xmath20 though both variables have different kinematical domains in the two processes .",
    "therefore , the @xmath0 decay rate can be used to provide a relation giving the mean shape factor , defined as @xmath21 in terms of observable quantities , @xmath16 and the product @xmath22 @xmath23 defining @xmath24 where a prime denotes all variables depending on @xmath25 which should be integrated over , the ncb cross section times neutrino velocity can then be conveniently written as @xmath26    notice that @xmath27 contains the ratio of ncb and @xmath0 decay shape factors . as discussed in details in @xcite , in several relevant cases ( super - allowed transitions , unique k - th forbidden transitions )",
    "the evaluation of @xmath28 is particularly simple so that eq .",
    "( [ sigma3 ] ) can be computed in an exact way .",
    "furthermore , in all cases where this is not possible , systematic uncertainties affecting the nuclear matrix element evaluation largely cancel in the shape factor ratio appearing in @xmath28 , thus providing a reliable estimate of the ncb cross sections .",
    "results for both allowed and unique forbidden decay cross sections having branching ratios greater than @xmath29 , namely 1272 @xmath30 decays and 799 @xmath31 decays can be found in @xcite .",
    "indeed , there are several nuclei spanning a wide range in @xmath5 for which interesting high values are reached in the range @xmath32 @xmath33 . as an example , in the interesting case of @xmath34h one gets @xmath35 @xmath33 , which for the standard homogeneous flux of cosmological neutrinos corresponds to 7.5 events per year of data taking for a mass of 100 g. in general , this estimate represents a lower bound , as massive neutrino density is expected to be locally larger because of gravitational clustering .",
    "this effect in a cold dark matter halo is quite relevant for order ev neutrino masses , see table [ table:1 ] .",
    "of course , the finite energy resolution of any experimental apparatus and the extremely low cross section make relic neutrino detection via ncb a real challenge due to the large background events produced by standard @xmath0 decay .",
    "in particular , the ratio of the event rate @xmath36 for the last @xmath0 decay electron energy bin @xmath37 , compared with the total ncb event rate is typically very large , since @xmath38 @xmath39 it is therefore a crucial issue to reach an energy resolution , the electron energy bin dimension of the apparatus @xmath40 , smaller than @xmath41 .",
    "for example , the expected background electron events which are produced by @xmath0 decay , yet having an energy which corresponds to the relic neutrino capture energy bin centered at @xmath42 are smaller than a factor three with respect to ncb processes if @xmath43 ev for @xmath44 ev , while a smaller neutrino mass of @xmath45 ev requires @xmath46 ev .",
    "presently , to obtain such an energy resolution seems very demanding .",
    "nevertheless , if a large neutrino mass will be found by the ongoing @xmath0 decay experiment katrin @xcite , it is conceivable that more efforts could be devoted to future generation of experiments with an improved energy resolution as good as 0.1 ev .",
    "* 7l @xmath4 ( ev ) & fd ( events yr@xmath47 ) & nfw ( events yr@xmath47 ) & mw ( events yr@xmath47 ) + 0.3 & 7.5 & 23 & 33 + 0.15 & 7.5 & 10 & 12 +",
    "in this paper we have summarized the analysis of ncb performed in @xcite . these processes",
    "have the remarkable property of having no energy threshold on the incoming neutrino energy and thus they might represent a good and numerous class of interactions suitable for low energy neutrino flux measurements .",
    "the possibility to pursue the ultimate goal of cosmological relic neutrino background detection via a future experimental implementation of this approach depends upon two crucial issues , a high value for the expected order of magnitude of ncb event rate , as well a very good energy resolution of the outgoing electron or positron , of the order of neutrino mass .",
    "both these aspects should be optimized by a careful choice of the @xmath0 decaying nuclei .",
