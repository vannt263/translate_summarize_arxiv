    "these are structures with balanced gain and loss such that the parity - time ( @xmath8 ) symmetry of the entire system is preserved .",
    "these materials depict altogether new behavior unknown to hermitian optical systems  e.g. , double refraction , power oscillations , unidirectional invisibility , left right asymmetry , non reciprocal diffraction patterns , etc .    in this work",

    "section 4 is kept for conclusions and discussions .",
    "within the heterojuntions @xmath20 , where the particle mass varies with position , the hermitian kinetic energy term @xmath21 is given by @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the momentum operator .",

    "the corresponding wave functions are plotted in fig .",
    "we observe a very interesting phenomenon  the standard @xmath1 symmetric rosen morse ii potential for constant mass and the varying mass diffused quantum well sandwiched between two heterojunctions , have some similar features : +  ( i ) the bound state energy is always real , hence there is no spontaneous breakdown of @xmath1 symmetry . + ( ii ) in this particular case too , the bound state energy switches from negative to positive value , depending on the width of the potential well @xmath92 , and the relative strengths of @xmath93 and @xmath58 .",
    "+ however , the bound state energies of rosen morse ii and the present model are significantly different .",
    "additionally , for @xmath94 , while the ground state energy switches from negative to positive value at @xmath95 in case of the standard rosen morse ii potential , for the model studied here , it occurs at @xmath96 , for @xmath97 . increasing the value of @xmath98 decreases this value of @xmath58 for energy switching .",
    "as stated earlier , the main purpose of this work is to study the behaviour of reflection and transmission amplitudes .",
    "for this purpose , we plot a series of graphs showing @xmath19 and @xmath18 , in different regimes .",
    "the system clearly depicts left - right asymmetry , typical of non hermitian systems . while the transmission amplitude comes out to be the same for both left and right incidence @xmath99 ( say ) , the case is quite different for the reflection amplitude @xmath100 .",

    ", @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath102 is normal ( @xmath103 ) when the particle enters from left  the absorptive side ( @xmath104 ) , and anomalous ( @xmath105 ) when the particle enters from right  the emissive side ( @xmath106 ) @xcite .",
    "[ ]    as the non hermiticity parameter @xmath107 increases , the behaviour of @xmath108 and @xmath17 changes abruptly . for low values of @xmath58 , for particle entering the device from left or right , @xmath17 increases with increasing energy , finally reaching unity",
    " total transmission .",
    "this observation is similar to that given in our earlier study @xcite .",
    "however , as @xmath58 increases , @xmath17 first decreases , reaches a minimum , and then increases to reach a saturation value . once again , the pattern is identical for left and right incidence .",
    "this peculiar behaviour is shown in the 3d plot of fig .",
    "5 . this abrupt change of behaviour occurs at a particular value of @xmath58 , and the trend continues for all values of @xmath58 greater than this value .    [ ]    similarly , if one draws the 3d plots for @xmath109 and @xmath110 , with respect to energy and @xmath58 , as shown in fig . 6 and fig .",
    "7 respectively , once again there is an abrupt change in their behaviour at and beyond some critical value of @xmath58 .",
    "the qualitative behaviour of @xmath18 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 for large values of @xmath58 , is shown in fig .",
    "8 ( for @xmath111 ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to their behaviour at low values of @xmath58 , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . however , the interesting point to note here is that the scattering coefficients remain finite everywhere , so the system does not exhibit spectral singularity .",
    "thus , in spite of the absence of spectral singularity , the non hermiticity parameter @xmath58 plays a crucial role in the behaviour of the scattering amplitudes , similar to its role in deciding the sign of bound state ( negative or positive ) .",
    "these are the most important findings of the present study .",
    "[ ]    calculating the coefficients @xmath17 , @xmath102 and @xmath112 in the limit @xmath113 , gives back the hermitian results for these coefficients  viz .",

    "to conclude , the special form of semiconductor device studied in this work displays some unique characteristics .",
    "the particular model considered here does not undergo spontaneous breakdown of @xmath1 symmetry , nor it does not exhibit spectral singularity . rather , the highlight of this pdem device is the non vanishing imaginary part of the potential near the heterojunctions , within the intermediate layer .",
    "the series of graphs plotted in the paper show the potential and mass functions ( fig .",
    "1 ) , the exact analytical scattering solutions in the entire device ( fig .",
    "2 ) , and also the first three bound state solutions ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the behaviour of the scattering amplitudes are shown in figures 4 to 8 . while the effect of the pdem is to introduce a non linearity in the otherwise plane wave solutions ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , fig .",
    "4 shows the kinks at the heterojunctions .",
    "numerical calculations show that the bound state energy switches from negative to positive value as @xmath58 increases .",
    "figures 4 to 8 give credence to the important role played by the non hermiticity parameter @xmath58 , in determining the scattering amplitudes . for low values of @xmath107 , the nature of the reflection and transmission coefficients as shown in fig .",
    "4 , is analogous to the observation in our previous study @xcite .",
    "however , as @xmath107 increases beyond a certain value , the qualitative picture of these coefficients changes abruptly . this is a new observation , hitherto unnoticed in earlier studies . at the same time",
    "this can not be called a spectral singularity ( ss ) , for the transmission and reflection coefficients viz . ,",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 , blow up at a ss @xcite . in this particular case ,",
    "all the three coefficients remain finite .",
    "additionally , their behaviour depends on whether the particle is entering the device from the left or from the right  i.e. , this non hermitian system too possesses left - right asymmetry , despite the particle having pdem in the region within the heterojunctions . for the particle entering the semiconductor device from the absorptive side ( @xmath116 ) ,",
    "reflection is normal ( @xmath117 ) , while for the particle entering the device from the emissive side ( @xmath118 ) the reflection is anomalous ( @xmath119 ) . at the same time",
    "@xmath120 . in a fairly recent work",
    "it has been shown that for the @xmath121 symmetric scarf ii potential , in a particular regime , @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "however , it did not consider spatially varying mass , nor any abrupt heterojunction . in our present study of a @xmath1 symmetric heterojunction in the form of a diffused quantum well with pdem , this conjecture is not valid .    with increase in artificial @xmath1 symmetric artificial optical structures , and semiconductor devices with",
    "position dependent mass heterojunctions , it is anticipated that this work provides some valuable insight into the transport properties of such a device , when a particle enters the material from one end and leaves from the other .",
