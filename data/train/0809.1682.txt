    "the formation and evolution of merger - built bulges and secularly - grown pseudobulges and bars is crucial to the evolution of spiral galaxies , and indeed their formation history is used to test models for the formation of structure in the universe such as the @xmath5cdm framework ; ( see kormendy & kennicutt 2004 for a review ) .",
    "the inner region of our own milky way shows evidence for a bulge ( e.g. blitz & spergel 1991 ) and at least one bar - like structure ( e.g. benjamin et al .",
    "2005 ; lpez - corredoira et  al . 2007 ) .",
    "furthermore , for our own bulge the stars are close enough that detailed stellar data may be obtained on a star - by - star basis , such as radial velocities and proper motions , which are simply not yet available for most external galaxies .",
    "these studies of our own bulge show it to be a distinct stellar population from the disk of the milky way with a wide range of abundances ( rich 1988 ) .",
    "high @xmath6 $ ]  compared to the disk suggests rapid enrichment ; type - ii sne produce the @xmath7-elements and result from short - lived , high - mass stars , while iron enrichment requires the rather slower buildup of a significant number of type i sne ( mcwilliam & rich 1994 ; zoccali et  al . 2006 ; lecureur et  al . 2007 ;",
    "fulbright et al .",
    "a recent spectroscopic comparison with halo objects shows the majority of bulge stars to be @xmath7-enhanced compared to the halo , thus the majority bulge stellar population can not have formed from the halo ( fulbright et al .",
    "2006 ; fulbright et  al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the detailed balance of populations of the bulge and its current kinematics remain rather poorly constrained , and thus the picture of its step - by - step formation and evolution is far from complete .",
    "strong , variable extinction caused by gas and dust in the intervening spiral arms ( e.g. sumi 2004 ) , contamination of the test population by stars in the foreground disk , and the significant spatial depth of the bulge along the line of sight , combine to make the separation of a pure - bulge samply for further study a challenging task .",
    "while one can identify a candidate main sequence , the main sequence turn - off ( hereafter msto ) usually used as an age / metallicity diagnostic is broadened by the age , metallicity and depth range of the bulge and confused by the foreground disk population .",
    "force - fitting the horizontal branch in the color - magnitude diagram ( hereafter cmd ) and comparison with globular cluster sequences suggests a majority population @xmath8  10 gyr in age , but with as much as 30% of the stars belonging to a young population ( holtzman et al .",
    "1993 ; ortolani et al .",
    "furthermore , a population of oh masers ( sevenster et al .",
    "1997 ) and a few hundred mass - losing agb stars ( van loon et al . 2003 ) _ has _ been detected in the inner milky way .",
    "these objects are claimed to represent an intermediate - age ( @xmath9-few gyr ) population within the inner milky way .",
    "these objects populate the circumnuclear molecular zone ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 ) and are thought to be tracers of a larger population that is difficult to separate from the bulk stellar population in the color - magnitude diagram ( lindqvist et al .",
    "1992 ; messineo et al .",
    "2002 ; habing et al .",
    "2006 ) . in optical cmds",
    ", young - intermediate age populations overlap significantly with the main sequence of a young foreground disk population ; separation of the bulge from the disk population is therefore critical if the detailed population distribution of the bulge is to be obtained .",
    "feltzing & gilmore ( 2000 ) compare number counts along the cmd between populous clusters at a range of galactic latitudes to estimate the foreground disk contamination , producing a prediction of disk contamination in two bulge fields and thus a differential estimate of the bulge population itself .",
    "they find a bulge population almost exclusively older than @xmath12  gyr .",
    "this conclusion was reinforced by a later study employing statistical subtraction to take off a scaled contamination from a comparison field in the foreground disk ; globular cluster comparison suggested an old , metal - rich population to fit the bulge well , but without a precise age distribution ( zoccali et al .",
    "while a metallicity gradient with height @xmath13  above the galactic midplane probably does exist ( zoccali et al . 2003 ) , a _ radial _",
    "metallicity gradient has yet to be conclusively demonstrated ( rich & origlia 2005 ; minniti & zoccali 2008 ) .",
    "no evidence has yet been found for blue stragglers in the bulge .",
    "blue stragglers are hydrogen - burning stars with apparent age younger than that of the parent population , most likely the result of significant mass deposition onto the star ( e.g. stryker 1993 ; bailyn 1995 ) . these objects are found in clusters of all ages ( e.g. stryker 1993 ) and would thus be expected to be present in the bulge .",
    "however they occupy a region of the cmd that overlaps with the foreground disk so are difficult to discriminate .",
    "stellar kinematics offer the cleanest method to separate bulge from disk .",
    "the disk shows apparent streaming motion in front of the bulge due to the motion of the sun about the galactic center , while the proper motion dispersion of the two populations should differ because the two populations have widely different ages and likely differing relaxation times ( binney & tremaine 1994 ) .",
    "while statistical subtraction tells us that some fraction of objects in a region of the cmd may be bulge objects , kinematic constraints allow us to assign likely bulge / disk membership to _ individual objects_.    beyond bulge - disk separation , stellar proper motions are valuable in their own right as a probe of the present - day kinematics of the bulge .",
    "proper motions have suggested that the bulge stars show net rotation in the same sense as the rest of the disk , though a smaller retrograde population may also be required ( spaenhauer et al .",
    "1992 ; zhao et al .",
    "most previous studies converge on the model that the bulge apparently rotates as a solid body , with circular velocity @xmath14  rising linearly with distance from the galactic center until the stellar population becomes dominated by disk stars ( which show roughly constant @xmath15 ) ; broadly similar behaviour is reproduced by bulge models including a rapidly rotating bar ( e.g. sellwood 1981 ; zhao 1996 ) .",
    "this consensus has recently been called into question by the radial velocity study of rich et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , which ( with velocities consistent with the pne results of beaulieu et al .",
    "2000 ) suggests an inflection point in the @xmath14  curve roughly @xmath80.6 kpc from the galactic center , outside which @xmath14  is constant at @xmath16 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this suggests that solid body - like rotation may only persist over the inner regions of the bulge / bar system .",
    "a change in the general character of stellar orbits within the inner region of the bulge may relate to an inner resonance ( e.g. sevenster 1999 ) . clearly ,",
    "an independent measure of the stellar @xmath14  curve is required .",
    "this is best constructed from datasets for which systematics at different galactocentric radii are similar , in particular the correction due to solar motion about the galactic center ; as we will demonstrate , proper motions along a single sight - line provide just such a dataset provided the observations are at sufficient depth to assemble large numbers of objects in each distance bin to overcome intrinsic variation .",
    "the bulge has now been the subject of a number of proper motion studies .",
    "early ground - based studies of 427 @xmath17  and @xmath18-giants in baade s window ( @xmath19 ) , using photographic plates separated by nearly 33 years , showed a proper motion distribution with small anisotropy , @xmath20  ( spaenhauer et al . 1992 ) . on the bulge minor axis , plate - scans over an area @xmath21  in plaut s window ( @xmath22 ) across a 21-year time interval were used to extract proper motions from 5088 objects ( at @xmath23 ) , finding similar dispersion and anisotropy to the baade s window sample ( mendez et al . 1996 ) .",
    "from the ground , five years of macho photometry allowed stars with proper motions @xmath24  mas yr@xmath1  to be isolated , to search for future microlensing events towards the bulge ( 50@xmath25  fields at @xmath26 and @xmath27 )  and magellanic clouds ( alcock et al .",
    "the ogle - ii experiment yielded proper motions of some @xmath28  stars from @xmath29  fields within ( @xmath30 ) and ( @xmath31 ) , with proper motions measured to a precision of 0.8 - 3.5 mas yr@xmath1  ( eyer & woniak 2001 ; sumi et al .",
    "2004 ) , which was recently used as the basis for a study of the trends in proper motion with location in the bulge ( rattenbury et al .",
    "2007a , b ) .",
    "most recently , plaut s window has been the subject of a second plate - based study of some 21,000 stars within a @xmath32  region , producing proper motions to @xmath9  mas yr@xmath1  and using @xmath33  cross - matches with 2mass to carefully select bulge giants ( vieira et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "turning to space - based proper motion studies , a number of studies of clusters that use proper motions to discriminate the cluster from the field , produce bulge proper motions if the field includes a significant number of bulge stars .",
    "zoccali et al .",
    "( 2001 ) reported the the velocity dispersion of about @xmath34  bulge stars at ( @xmath35 ) , as a by - product of their wfpc2 study of the cluster ngc 6553 , finding proper motion dispersion consistent with previous ground - based studies of baade s window .",
    "similar results were obtained from the bulge stars in the field of a wfpc2 study of the metal - rich cluster ngc 6528 , at ( @xmath36 ; feltzing & johnson 2002 ) .",
    "however , kuijken & rich ( 2002 ) were the first to dedicate hst observations to bulge proper motion studies , returning to baade s window ( @xmath37 ) and the sagittarius low - extinction window ( @xmath38 ) with wfpc2 .",
    "this isolated 3252 bulge stars in baade s window and 3867 in the sagittarius window , concluding that the bulge can be best fit with a 10 gyr - old open cluster - type sequence .",
    "no detection of @xmath4 covariance was reported , nor was any detection of blue straggler candidates .",
    "an acs / wfc and wfpc2 program is ongoing to reimage fields for which observations are already present in the hst archive ( kuijken 2004 ; see soto et al .",
    "2007 for prelimiary results ) .",
    "recently , acs / hrc was used to survey @xmath39  fields near baade s window across a @xmath40  region in the vicinity of baade s window , in order to compare the bulk kinematic properties of bulge fields as a function of location relative to the galactic center ( kozowski et al .",
    "2006 ) . as pointed out by vieira et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , the results of the acs / hrc study and the literature differ quite strongly from those of rattenbury et al .",
    "( 2007b ; particularly the dispersions @xmath41  and @xmath42 ) .",
    "this appears to be due to differences in the selection of tracers used ; the sample of rattenbury et al .",
    "( 2007b ) may be contaminated by evolved disk objects ( vieira et al .",
    "2007 ; see also rattenbury et al .",
    "clearly , some care is required in the selection of bulge tracer objects , particularly above the msto .",
    "we report on the use of acs / wfc to extract precise proper motions from a large number of stars in the sagittarius window towards the bulge .",
    "the sagittarius window eclipsing extrasolar planet search ( sweeps project ; sahu et al .",
    "2006 ) obtained an extremely well - sampled photometric dataset with acs / wfc of the sagittarius window towards the bulge ; this forms our first epoch .",
    "a repeat visit just over two years later forms the second epoch , from which we extract proper motions . at ( @xmath43)=(1.25@xmath44,-2.65@xmath44 ) ,",
    "the line of sight passes within @xmath45  pc of the galactic center .",
    "this is far enough from the center that the claimed population of young - intermediate age objects traced by the oh masers and agb stars , is likely to be an insignificant contributor to the observed field ; such objects are likely confined to within @xmath46  pc of the galactic mid - plane and are found preferentially near the galactic center ( sevenster et al .",
    "1999 ; frogel et al .",
    "thus the stellar population of our field of view consists of bulge , disk and halo objects .",
    "our first epoch has a total integration time @xmath086ks",
    "each in @xmath47  and @xmath48  and is the deepest ever observation of the galactic bulge . with @xmath49  detections of proper motions towards the wings of the proper motion distributions where disk / bulge separation is greatest , we push the disk contamination below the 0.3% level and extract the purest",
    ", largest sample of bulge stars yet assembled .",
    "this report is organized as follows : we provide the particulars of the observations used in section [ s_obs ] .",
    "we report the procedures used to produce precise position measurements and the resulting proper motions in section [ s_red ] .",
    "section [ s_pm ] outlines the broad features of the proper motion distribution of the population as a whole . to correct for disk contamination in the sample of kinematically selected bulge objects",
    ", we must first estimate the fraction of disk and bulge objects in the observed sample ; to do so requires tracing the proper motion distribution as a function of distance along the line of sight .",
    "we do so in section [ s_dist ] ; before returning to the bulge / disk population distinction we use the distance dependence of the proper motions to extract some kinematic properties of the bulge in section [ s_vdist ] .",
    "we select a likely bulge population in section [ s_popn ] and briefly examine its properties .",
    "finally , in section [ s_cand ] we assess the likely kinematic membership of the sixteen sweeps planet candidates from sahu et al .",
    "the target field , at ( l , b ) = ( 1.25@xmath44,-2.65@xmath44 ) , has been observed a total of five times with hst .",
    "the field was first observed on 21 august 1994 with wfpc2 , then again with wfpc2 on 08 august 2000 .",
    "proper motions based on these observations have been reported by kuijken & rich ( 2002 ) .",
    "acs / wfc first observed this and four nearby regions on 9 june 2003 to allow optimal target selection for the sweeps planet - search .",
    "we focus on the final two epochs ; the deep sweeps observations of february 2004 and march 2006 - hereafter the `` first '' and `` second '' epochs in this text refer to the 2004 and 2006 epochs .",
    "our field is the farthest from the minor axis in which deep proper motion studies of the galactic bulge have been performed .",
    "that said , our line of sight passes within @xmath8200  pc of the center of the milky way . with",
    "the sun located @xmath812 - 20  pc above the galactic mid - plane ( joshi 2007 ) , our line of sight reaches @xmath80.5 kpc beneath the galactic mid - plane before intercepting the innermost spiral arm ( assuming the logarithmic spiral of e.g. cordes 2004 accurately describes the norma spiral arm on the far side of the galactic center ) .",
    "this is @xmath81 disk scale - height beneath the mid - disk ( slightly more with the milky way disk - warp ; e.g. momany et al .",
    "2006 ) , thus the disk contribution to the field on the far side of the bulge should be rather lower than the near - side .",
    "acs - wfc epoch-1 observations took place between february 22 - 29 2004 .",
    "a total of 254 exposures in @xmath48  and 265 in @xmath47  were taken , each with integration - time 339s .",
    "the target field was specifically chosen to maximise the yield of potential host - stars in a single wfc pointing and at the same time minimize the number of bright objects that would black out regions of the chip through charge - bleeding ( and thus reduce the efficiency of the survey to planet - detection ) .",
    "subpixel dithers were set to well and redundantly sample intra - pixel sensitivity variations .",
    "the integration - times chosen provide per - observation photometric accuracy of about 0.04 mag at @xmath47=23 .",
    "] , with saturation point just above the main - sequence turn - off at @xmath47=18.6 . to measure",
    "bright objects , three integrations each in @xmath47  and @xmath48  were taken at 20s integration - time , providing unsaturated measurements over the @xmath50  range , aiding isochrone fits to the mixture of stellar populations present .",
    "information about these observations can be found in sahu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , with further detail forthcoming ( sahu et al . 2008 , in prep ) .",
    "an additional few observations were taken offset by 3@xmath51  in detector - y to cover the inter - chip gap ; we do not use these bridging observations in this work .      repeat observations of the sweeps field",
    "were taken with acs / wfc on march 09 2006 in @xmath47 .",
    "ten deep integrations were taken and two shallow ; a slightly longer visibility interval per hst orbit led to 349s integration times each for the deep observations .",
    "subpixel dithers were programmed in pairs , nominally at @xmath52  pix in detector x , y from pixel - center , in reality @xmath53  pix from the programmed values .",
    "the two shallow observations were taken at 20s integration times to provide proper motion estimates for bright objects .",
    "the two deepest acs epoch images are quite well - aligned : not including subpixel dithers , image centers from the two epochs are shifted with respect to each other by ( 4.78,8.48 ) pixels ( 0.24@xmath51,0.424@xmath51 ) along the detector , with mutual rotation @xmath548@xmath51 , corresponding to a pixel - offset @xmath80.1 at the corners of the detector from rotation alone .",
    "the epoch-1 acs dataset is among the deepest set of observations ever taken in the optical with hst , with a strategy specifically set to well sample the intra - pixel sensitivity variations with redundancy , thus allowing an optimal combination of images into an oversampled representation of the image - scene .",
    "the sweeps project achieved this using an extension of the gilliland techniques ( gilliland et al .",
    "1999 ; gilliland et al .",
    "2000 ) , in which an image _ model _ of the scene is produced for each filter . the flux at each pixel is represented by a legendre polynomial in the sub - pixel offsets @xmath55 , @xmath56  for each input frame ( the polynomial coefficients and number of terms to retain being determined by the counts in each pixel ) .",
    "for the sweeps dataset this process was augmented through the fitting to each image of a convolution kernel , that maps each input frame onto the master - representation and thus accounts for focus - breathing .",
    "the resulting continuous image - model can be evaluated at any sampling desired as it tracks the estimate of flux within each wfc pixel at each point .",
    "it is important to note that the input frames are never resampled in the creation of this image - model , so photometric precision is not lost .",
    "psf - fitting photometry of this superimage produced a master - list of magnitudes and positions for the sweeps planet search ( sahu et al .",
    "the 339s exposures saturate just above the bulge main sequence turn - off ; catalogue magnitudes for objects above the turn - off were produced using psf - fitting photometry of the 20s exposures .",
    "objects saturated in the short exposures were photometered summing over pixels into which charge has bled ( gilliland 2004 ) .",
    "the result was a catalogue of 246,793 objects detected both in @xmath47  and @xmath48 .",
    "the well - documented geometric distortion due to the optical layout of acs / wfc ( e.g. anderson & king 2006 ) presents challenges when attempting precise position measurements .",
    "residuals that vary in a complex way across the chips persist at the 0.05 - 0.1-pixel level after the standard fourth - order polynomial distortion correction is applied during the drizzle process ; this alone makes the standard drizzled image - stacks supplied by the pipeline problematic for our science goals .",
    "we must use the raw images ( or a combination thereof ) to preserve positional accuracy .",
    "after some experimentation ( appendix a ) it was found that position - scatter was minimized by using each image within an epoch for a separate estimate of the position and flux of each object .",
    "this produces superior results to positions measured from a stack of images .",
    "this approach rests on the existence of a highly - supersampled model for the  effective psf  ( the instrumental psf as recorded by the detector , hereafter epsf ; see anderson & king 2000 for discussion ) . for the acs / wfc ,",
    "focus breathing is taken into account by adding a perturbation - psf to the epsf ; this perturbation - psf is fit from each image separately ( anderson & king 2006 ) .      with at least 246,793 objects in the frame ( on average one every @xmath57  pixels ) , the field is crowded but not pathologically so . to measure positions on the frame",
    ", we thus used an improved version of the anderson & king ( 2006 ) fitting routine _ img2xym.f _",
    ", with a 3@xmath582 perturbation - psf grid rather than a single perturbation psf , which provides an improved measurement , and the capability to subtract neighbors from each object before measuring its flux and position , should similar estimates for the neighbors be available . to minimize error ,",
    "the epsf was constructed from frames that have been flatfielded and bias - subtracted but not resampled or corrected for distortion .",
    "thus measurements are performed in the raw coordinate system of the detector ( _ _ flt  _ space ) . the existence of extensive globular cluster observations allowed distortion in the camera to be constrained ( see anderson & king 2003 & 2006 ) .",
    "this distortion - correction is used by the anderson & king ( 2006 ) routines produce output in both the raw _ _ flt  _ system and a transformed coordinate set in which the application of the distortion - correction removed higher - order distortions to the level of 0.005 - 0.01 pixel .",
    "we will refer to this frame as the `` distortion - free '' frame , though it should be remembered that residual distortion at the levels just quoted may still be present .",
    "in addition to position and flux measurements @xmath59 , the anderson & king ( 2006 ) routines output a quality factor @xmath60 , which measures the difference between the epsf - fitted flux and the aperture flux ( sum of pixel values ) within a 5@xmath585-pixel region centered on the position of the star , scaled by the epsf - fitted flux .",
    "this ratio @xmath60  is seen to correlate with the total flux from detected crowding objects in the master photometry catalogue ( figure [ f_qual ] ) , so we adopt it as a measure of crowding due to neighboring objects ( and thus including crowding objects too close to have been isolated and measured in the photometry ) .",
    "we use multiple passes of stellar position and flux measurement to take account of the tendency of neighbor - subtraction to build in a dependency of the measurement of each star on those surrounding it .",
    "each pass requires a master list of mean estimates for each star from the previous pass and a matchup list for each frame giving the coordinates of a sample of well - measured , isolated objects in the input frame and master - list , so that the transformation between the master list and the frame itself can be properly taken into account when subtracting neighbors .",
    "the first pass with the anderson & king ( 2006 ) routines produces a set of @xmath61  estimates for each image without neighbor subtraction , and with nonuniform row ordering .",
    "we match these measurements to the master catalogue of 246,793 objects from photometry of the optimal superimage from sahu et al ( 2006 ) to recast each of the pass-1 estimates with the same row - ordering as the sahu et al ( 2006 ) catalogue .",
    "note that we _ never _ use the position and flux estimates from sahu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) again in this analysis due to the shifting of flux that takes place when constructing the stack ( appendix a ) ; this catalog is used purely to enforce a uniform row - ordering in the object catalogues for proper motion extraction .",
    "we now construct a sigma - clipped median set of @xmath61  measurements of each star from pass-1 , accounting for residual trends in the manner described below .",
    "this forms the input catalogue to the multi - pass photometry .    in subsequent passes",
    ", this input catalogue is transformed back into each individual _ _ flt  _ frame using the matchup lists just produced .",
    "neighbors are now subtracted from each object before measurement ; to avoid measurement instability and dependence on the ordering in which objects are processed , the position and magnitude measurements from the previous pass are used when subtracting neighbors .",
    "the individual measurements are now used to produce a sigma - clipped mean measurement for @xmath61 , which updates the input list for the next pass as well as the matchup lists . as a matter of record , photometry using the modified anderson & king routines with neighbor subtraction takes over an hour per frame on a 3ghz linux cpu with 1 gb ram , so we split this step across multiple cpus to reduce the time necessary to process 265 images in the first epoch .",
    "the collation , accounting for trends and refinement of the input list to the next pass , requires the complete measurement list for each star and can take up to eight hours per pass .",
    "this process is repeated until convergence ; there is little improvement between the third and fourth pass of the photometry except at the faintest end of the star - list , so we stop after four passes .",
    "although there are only ten deep images in the second epoch , the production of a clipped master - list does improve the photometry for neighbor - subtraction so we follow a similar process for the 2006 epoch .",
    "a reference image is chosen for each epoch with focus within a few percent of the maximum focus sharpness and commanded orientation at the middle of the dither pattern ( for 2004 image j8q632crq was used , for 2006 image j9ev01ntq was used ) .",
    "the anderson & king ( 2006 ) estimates in _ _ flt  _ space are related to those in distortion - free space by a well - constrained transformation , thus we are free to choose which frame we use for fitting the transformation that maps each individual set of measurements onto the master - set ( essential for producing the refined matchup lists ) ; we work in distortion - corrected space so that linear transformations can be used , reducing the transformation error .",
    "the distortion correction transformation itself is claimed to be accurate to the 0.005 - 0.01 pixel level ( anderson & king 2006 ) , this tolerance introduces 0.01 - 0.5 mas uncertainty in position measurement .",
    "additionally , observatory - level systematics are present that cause the position and flux to vary with time - this is clearly seen in a plot of the amplitude of the perturbation - psf that must be applied to the library psf to optimise the measurements in the first pass ( a proxy for focus ; figure [ f_focus ] ) .",
    "these trends are not an entirely smooth function of time and thus can add scatter of up to @xmath80.5mas to the position estimates .",
    "we account for and subtract trends in @xmath55 , @xmath62y and @xmath62 m for each chip independently , assessing the trends from the @xmath84,000 best - measured objects in the frame .",
    "experimentation with polynomial surface - fitting and a lookup - table approach suggested that for our data a polynomial with cross - terms up to @xmath63  provided the most robust subtraction of trends . in cases",
    "where subtraction of the polynomial surface _ increased _",
    "the scatter across the frame ( an indication that residual trends were not significant for the frame in question ) , the subtraction was not used .",
    "when positions and fluxes are measured with neighbor - subtraction , the variance of measurement within an epoch is generally lower than from a single - pass alone and the distribution is rather tighter .",
    "however after the second pass ( i.e. the first with neighbor - subtraction ) a small population appears that is fainter than instrumental magnitude @xmath64  and with roughly constant position - rms @xmath65  pix or so ( figure [ fig_rms ] ) . these objects are apparently due to the influence of neighboring objects , and were dealt with appropriately ( appendix b ) .",
    "in addition , the effects of differential charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) are noticeable both in position measurements taken at differing integration times within the same epoch , and in magnitude measurements taken at similar integration times in two epochs , due to degradation of the detector in the low - earth environment . however , any differential cte effect on our _ proper motion _ measurements is predicted to be too small to measure , and indeed is not observed in our positions ( appendix c ) .",
    "the result is two star lists , where mean positions in the 2004 epoch are in the distortion - free frame of the most representative 2004 image and the mean positions in the 2006 list are in the distortion - free frame of the most representative 2006 image .",
    "the distortion - correction of anderson & king ( 2006 ) was applied to both lists of coordinates ( and both sets of fluxes through the variation in pixel - area on the sky ) .",
    "residual imperfections in the distortion remaining after subtracting trends will lead to distortion remaining between the two position - lists .",
    "the acs / wfc distortion is now known to change monotonically with time , as can be seen for example in the evolution of the skew terms in the distortion solution used here .",
    "this change is rather small for most purposes , roughly 0.3 pix in the 2002 - 2006 interval at the corners of the image , and appears to be confined to the linear terms ( anderson 2007 ) .",
    "however , evolution in distortion as traced by the first six terms of the transformation are automatically accounted for in our approach as we are fitting 6-term transformations between the epochs ; no evidence is seen for evolution in the higher terms of the distortion correction .",
    "the 2006 epoch is particularly prone to residual distortion due to the comparatively low number of frames available to characterize and remove the frame - by - frame residual trends .",
    "we therefore return to the individual 2006-epoch position - lists , recomputing the proper motions on an image - by - image basis .",
    "we use local transformations to best map the frame near each target star onto the frame of the 2004 starlist . for each target star in each 2006 image",
    ", we use an amoeba fit ( press et al . 1992 ) to find the 6-term transformation that maps the positions of a set of nearby tracer stars from 2006 onto their positions in the 2004 star - list ( figure [ fig_tracers ] ) . this transformation",
    "is then used to predict the position of the target star in the 2004 epoch .",
    "the offset of this position from the true position in 2004 is then the proper motion of the target star , estimated from the individual 2006 star - list with reference to the 2004 master - list .",
    "the set of @xmath66-@xmath67  proper motion estimates ( at least three good measurements are needed ) is then averaged together with outlier removal to estimate the true proper motion of the target star .",
    "finally , the proper motions in image coordinates are transformed into proper motions in galactic coordinates .",
    "this process is repeated for every object in the master - photometry list , which is computationally accomplished most conveniently through an overnight run .",
    "care must be taken when selecting frame - to - frame reference stars in this process .",
    "as we lack an extragalactic reference point , we assume that all the stars in the frame are in motion and adopt as the zero point the average motion of the bulge population as estimated from the cmd .",
    "of likely non - disk objects we include only those unsaturated objects for which the combined x- and y - coordinate rms from the 2004 epoch is less than 0.007  pix , the crowding measure @xmath60  less than 0.025 and at least 200 measurements were taken in the 2004 epoch ( so the positions are well - characterized ) . as a precaution",
    ", the 2006 mean - position list produced above is used to remove tracer stars that show discrepancy above 200mas ( 4  pix ) between mean position in the two epochs , indicative of unusually high proper motion , a problem with the transformation between frames , or an object mismatch ; this culling is needed for a handful of objects .",
    "we do not include the target star itself in the transformation ( see anderson et al .",
    "2006 ) , and are careful to ensure that tracer stars only on the same chip as the target star are used , to guard against any trends over time in the distortion of the two chips relative to each other .",
    "these considerations leave @xmath88,000 reference objects over both chips . of these objects , the nearest 100 to the target star",
    "are selected to fit the local transformation , with 5-pass sigma - clipping removing typically 8 - 20 objects ( figure [ fig_tracers ] ) .",
    "the area covered by the reference stars is typically @xmath68  pixels , or @xmath69  the field of view .",
    "this approach allows the proper motion error to be fully characterized on a star by star basis . for each star ,",
    "this error contains three terms : the internal scatter @xmath70  accompanying @xmath71 repeated position measurements in the 2004 epoch , the rms variation in position difference @xmath72  over the 2.04-yr interval between the @xmath73  set of position - pairs , and finally the relative position - scatter that will be built up when @xmath74  tracer stars are allowed to move in random directions with intrinsic scatter @xmath75  mas yr@xmath1  over a 2.04-year time interval . _ per co - ordinate _",
    ", then , the proper motion error is : @xmath76 for well - measured stars the first two terms are rather small ; in 2004 we find the brightest nonsaturated objects show positional scatter @xmath70  in the 1.5 _ milli_pixel regime ( figure [ fig_pmerror ] ) ; the intrinsic scatter @xmath75  over the 2.04 year interval dominates the error estimate for these objects however the advantage to this approach is that the additional systematic introduced when two average position - lists are used under the same distortion correction , has been fully accounted for . at the faint end the measurement error dominates the error budget .",
    "we will want to compare proper motions above the main sequence turn - off with those below it",
    ". with 265 + 10 exposures total at 339s or longer , we might expect better statistics when producing average proper motions from the long exposures compared to the five available short exposures .",
    "however , the integration time for the long exposures was chosen so that saturation coincides roughly with the turn - off ; thus , position measurements and therefore proper motions may be subject to greater error than the variance of position measurements would indicate . indeed , we note a cte - like effect when comparing the positions measured for highly saturated objects compared to the same objects measured with much shorter integration times ( figure [ ref_fig_satn ] ; see also appendix c ) .",
    "we thus extracted proper motions from the shorter exposures to compare with the long exposures , to search for any saturation effects .",
    "the process is similar to that used for the deeper exposures , however this time too few integrations are available to make possible the trend - fitting and removal procedures used for the deeper exposures . instead",
    ", proper motions are computed pairwise between each of the six possible pairs of measurements between the three short integrations in 2004 and the two in 2006 .",
    "the results are then robustly averaged with outlier removal to produce proper motion estimates from the short integrations .",
    "the measured magnitude for each star is the sigma - clipped mean of all five brightness measurements for each star , to mitigate the effects of cosmic rays when subtracting neighbors for object - measurement .",
    "the resulting proper motion distribution is statistically indistinguishable to that from the deeper integrations , as we show in section [ s_pm ] .      to illustrate that we are indeed measuring proper motions , and not spurious events , we construct multi - epoch proper motions , using all five epochs",
    "at which this field has been observed ( section [ s_obs ] ) .",
    "position - measurements from the wfpc2 observations and the relatively poorly temporally - sampled 2003 acs / wfc observations have rather larger error than our 2004 and 2006 measurements , whilst the transformation from wfpc2 to acs / wfc systems is not yet fully refined . to extract science from our proper motions we therefore content ourselves with the 2004 and 2006 epochs .",
    "however , as can be seen in figure [ f_multi ] , we clearly _ are _ measuring motion of the stars across the field of view , with the distance traveled between measurements proportional to the time interval between the measurements ( figure [ f_multi ] ) .",
    "the result of the procedures in the previous section is a set of proper motions for 187,346 objects in our frame , 81,140 to better than 0.3 mas yr@xmath1  in _ both _ coordinates . from the shorter observations ,",
    "a list of @xmath77  objects is produced with proper motions at better than 1mas yr@xmath1  accuracy .",
    "we aim to estimate proper motions in the disk as separate from the bulge , so we first examine the proper motions above the main sequence turn - off .",
    "as noted by several previous authors , the region above the msto , where the cmd splits relatively cleanly into disk - dominated and evolved bulge - dominated populations , provides a convenient tracer which can be used to estimate the kinematics of disk and bulge populations .",
    "we will use this as a first estimate when we attempt to divide the populations further by apparent distance below .",
    "the longitudinal proper motions clearly separate the disk and bulge populations , with the latitudinal proper motions also providing separation but to a lesser extent . fitting a single gaussian to each of the proper motion histograms of the two populations",
    "suggests separations @xmath78=@xmath79  mas yr@xmath1  between the two populations .",
    "there is thus an average tilt of order 13@xmath44  between the centroid proper motions of the two populations ( figure [ f_short ] ) .",
    "the proper motions in this region from the short exposures are statistically identical to those from the long exposures : @xmath78=@xmath80  mas yr@xmath1  between the two populations ( figure [ f_short2 ] ) .",
    "however , the scatter in the resulting proper distribution is lower , implying superior measurement .",
    "because proper motions above the msto show different systematics between the long and short exposures , we can not simply add the two sets of measurements in quadrature .",
    "instead , for objects that ( i ) are saturated in the long exposures , and for which ( ii ) at least five proper motion measurements are retained after sigma - clipping , we simply substitute proper motions from long exposures with those from the short exposures .",
    "because of different selection biases for bulge objects above and below the msto ( which define the reference transformation between epochs ) , we are careful to first take into account the difference between proper motion zeropoints between long and short exposures ; this difference amounts to ( @xmath81)=(-0.2,0.01 ) mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "kinematic distinction between bulge and disk is most vividly illustrated by color - coding the cmd by the mean proper motions @xmath82  and their dispersions @xmath83 . as noted previously by kuijken & rich ( 2002 ) ,",
    "@xmath84  and particularly @xmath42  show clear association with the bulge population ( figure [ fig_hess ] ) , the latter expected for a dynamically older population .",
    "the conclusion that the bulge is mostly an old stellar population , is thus independent of the details of any isochrone fits .",
    "the longitudinal proper motion scatter is also a tracer of the bulge stellar population , though less obviously than the latitudinal scatter , as expected for a foreground disk with multiple populations participating in streaming motion of various speeds around the galactic plane .",
    "there is also a hint of a trend in @xmath85 , however from proper motions alone the significance of this trend is not clear .",
    "the motion of the sun with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) causes a trend in @xmath84  and @xmath85  that is strongest for foreground disk objects in off - axis fields ; indeed with multi - filter observations to estimate distance and extinction directly , this can be used to constrain stellar motions in the disk ( vieira et al .",
    "this trend increases as @xmath86 ; any intrinsic disk - to - bulge proper motion trends are superimposed on this trend .",
    "because the sun orbits the galactic center slightly faster than the lsr , this trend will be in the opposite sense to the @xmath84  trend we observe , in that the solar reflex contribution to proper motions will be negative with respect to our tracer bulge objects . for our field ,",
    "the size of this correction to bulge objects will be @xmath80.1 - 0.2 mas yr@xmath1  from the near- to far - side of the bulge . with two - filter photometry for our field",
    ", we do not have distance estimates for most of our objects .",
    "we therefore restrict detailed kinematic interpretation to those objects for which distances can be estimated ( see below ) ; for these objects the solar motion drops out as a constant velocity term .",
    "we note in passing that the size of the solar motion trend is the same size as the apparent trend in @xmath85  across the cmd ( figure [ fig_hess ] ) .",
    "we need to assess the contamination from foreground disk stars in our kinematically selected bulge sample ; this requires us to estimate the number of disk and bulge stars in our field .",
    "this exercise in turn requires that we determine the kinematics as a function of distance along the line of sight , so we now turn to dissection of proper motion as a function of distance .",
    "we estimate distances to each star by computing its distance modulus relative to the isochrone of the mean - bulge population ( from sahu et al .",
    "this isochrone was fit by dividing the cmd into strips of equal color , taking the median in each strip and finding the combination of extinction , distance modulus and metallicity that best fits the resulting ridgeline for a canonical bulge age of 10 gyr .",
    "isochrones from vandenberg , bergbusch , & dowler ( 2006 ) were used , transformed to the acs bandpasses as reported in brown et al .",
    "the mean - bulge isochrone has ( m - m)@xmath87 , foreground extinction e(b - v)=0.64 and [ @xmath7/fe]=0.3 .",
    "note that although sahu et al ( 2006 ) used the standard extinction law ( as opposed to the anomalous extinction of sumi ( 2004 and references therein ) , this distance modulus does agree with the _ corrected _ distance modulus of red clump giants in the bulge ( sumi 2004 ) , and corresponds to a mean - bulge distance of 7.24 kpc . with the geometrically determined sun - galactic center distance @xmath88  kpc ( eisenhauer et al .",
    "2005 ) , this bulge distance is consistent with the distance of intersection of the bulge major axis with the line of sight for bulge orientation angle @xmath89 .",
    "the majority of the interstellar extinction takes place in the foreground screen of the galactic spiral arms ( stanek 1996 ; cordes & lazio 2003 ) . for objects within about 3.3 kpc of the galactic center ( i.e. interior to the norma spiral arm ) ,",
    "this approximation is adequate for detailed constraints on the bulge ( cordes 2004 ; wainscoat et al . 1992 ) . farther out from the galactic center",
    ", the line of sight passes through the spiral arms carina - sagittarius ( at approximately 6.7 & 6.4 kpc from the galactic center on the near and far side of the galaxy respectively ) , crux - scutum ( at 4.8 & 4.8 kpc ) and norma ( 3.3 & 2.9 kpc ) .",
    "the interstellar dust distribution of the galactic disk shows scale height @xmath80.14  kpc ( bienaym , robin , & crez 1987 ) , which means our line of sight passes more than one dust scale - height from the galactic mid - plane just before intercepting the norma spiral arm on the near - side .",
    "thus distances inferred for objects closer than @xmath84  kpc will be somewhat uncertain .",
    "some care must be taken interpreting the resultant distance modulus , as the magnitude scatter is not due to distance effects alone .",
    "this is most clearly seen by comparing the distance estimates obtained from the main - sequence to those of hb clump+rcg bump objects ( which we denote together as red - clump giant , or rcg objects ; the small contamination from evolved disk objects referred to in zoccali et al .",
    "2003 and vieira et al .",
    "2007 is not an important contamination for this estimate ) .",

    "to be highly overrepresented in the main sequence sample , this would bias the distance - modulus distribution towards the bright end ; this is not seen .",
    "the two measures should therefore be identical .",
    "the fact that the scatter of the main sequence distance measure is a factor two higher than that from the rcg measure suggests that the distance estimate for the main sequence is contaminated by other effects which would include metallicity variations , the presence of stellar binaries , etc . as described in section [ ss_recov ] . when using photometric distance estimates to draw conclusions about bulge kinematics , we use the scaling between the rcg sample and the sample below the msto to correct all apparent photometric distance modulii to estimated true distance modulii .",
    "to assess the impact of this pollution of our distance estimate on our ability to recover bulge kinematics , we first attempt to reproduce the distance discrepancy , then compare the kinematics we would recover with those simulated .",
    "the cmd of a trial bulge population was simulated using the mean - bulge isochrone from sahu et al .",
    "first a stellar population was produced along the mean - bulge isochrone ( a salpeter imf was assumed for simplicity ; the results turn out to be rather insensitive to the imf form adopted ) .",
    "the population was then perturbed by a distance modulus distribution matching that measured from the rcg objects ( figure [ f_distcomp ] , upper right panel ) .",
    "the population was then further perturbed due to a binary population . because equal - mass binaries are rather unlikely above the msto , the binary effect was only added to objects beneath the turn - off . a metallicity distribution to the magnitudes was then added using the rich et al . ( 2007 ) spectroscopic results to estimate the distribution of metallicity and the vandenberg isochrones to translate this into a magnitude perturbation ( see brown et al .",
    "2005 ) ; beneath the turn - off this perturbs the magnitudes and ( to a lesser extent ) colors ; above the turn - off the main effect is on color .",
    "the binary fraction of the bulge is unknown , as is the distribution of relative brightness @xmath91  of binary components .",
    "we first used the solar neighborhood as a proxy , using the tabulation from hipparcos of sderhjelm ( 2007 ) , although repeated experiments suggest the final result is somewhat insensitive to both the binary fraction and @xmath91 , providing equal - light binaries are not dominant , and the binary fraction is of order @xmath92 .",

    "we now assess our ability to recover input kinematics . for each trial ,",
    "stellar velocities were simulated following a simple model that qualitatively matches the radial velocity results of rich et al ( 2007 ) ; the bulge is assumed to participate in solid - body rotation up to some cut - off radius @xmath93  with a flat mean circular speed curve @xmath94  km s@xmath1  exterior to this radius .",
    "velocity dispersion of 75 km s@xmath1  was added to the canonical curve , and the resulting stellar velocities translated into proper motions .",

    "error in the distance inferred thus propogates through to error in the inferred circular speed curve .    the circular speed curve extracted from the simulated proper motions",
    "is then fit to the simple model for the trial , and the result compared to the input model .",
    "this process is repeated for many trials ; figure [ f_binsim ] shows the resulting distribution of recovered parameters over 300,000 trials . aside from cases in which the fit fails to find a solution ( both @xmath103  and @xmath104  zero ) , the cutoff radius @xmath103  tends to be about a factor two higher than that input , and with a high scatter ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "the recovered tangential circular speed @xmath106  is systematically lower than that input ( 50 km s@xmath1 ) by a factor @xmath107 ; the most frequently recovered value being @xmath108 km s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , the form and approximate cutoff of the input circular speed curve _ can _ be recovered , but with a constant circular speed @xmath109  and cutoff radius @xmath103  about half and twice that input , respectively .",
    "we group objects by distance modulus to estimate the space motion of the average star in each bin as a function of distance @xmath110  ( figure [ fig_obs ] ; we remind the reader that we have corrected apparent distance modulii to estimates of the true distance modulii ; section [ ss_recov ] ) . within 3kpc of the mean - bulge , we use bins of equal ( @xmath111 ) , so that the number of objects in each bin traces the mean volume density of stars in that bin .",
    "we assume that the bulge stars in our selected sample are members of the same population , so that the absolute magnitude distribution is the same for each bin across the bulge .",
    "we also assume that the kinematic properties of the bulge do not vary strongly with absolute magnitude , so that our tendency to preferentially detect intrinsically fainter objects when they are closer , does not bias the kinematics we produce . at @xmath112 ,",
    "our tracer objects are well above the brightness at which photometric completeness becomes a significant systematic ( e.g. piotto et al .",
    "note that the proper motion dispersion decreases once we probe the far side of the bulge , an indication that photometric errors are not dominating our kinematics on the far side of the bulge .",
    "furthermore , while the proper motion dispersion decreases on the bulge far side , the corresponding _ velocity _ dispersion does not .",
    "our field of view encompasses an ever - larger area on the sky with distance , so the far distance - bins may sample a wider range of velocities than those close - by .      without the line - of - sight counterpart @xmath113  for this field , equation ( [ eq_pmvel ] ) represents two conditions in three unknown velocities ; to break the degeneracy we must either observe @xmath114  as a function of line of sight distance , or adopt a relationship between the three components of streaming velocity ; such a relationship is best obtained through numerical modeling in a realistic potential ( see e.g. zhao 1996 ) .",
    "we adopt a simple prescription for @xmath14  and set the other two components to zero .",
    "the ongoing radial velocity survey of rich et al .",
    "( 2007 ) finds no evidence for minor - axis rotation , so @xmath98  @xmath80 is at this stage reasonable .",
    "observations are rather more ambiguous for @xmath97  within a few degrees of the galactic rotation axis ( rich et al . 2007 ) ; we set this term to zero to determine if it is required to fit the observed velocities .",
    "we assume @xmath14  follows the broad pattern of the ism ( e.g. clemens 1985 ) , rising monotonically with galactocentric radius interior to some cut - off radius @xmath103 , exterior to which @xmath14  is roughly constant at @xmath115   km s@xmath1 . in this respect",
    "our prescription for @xmath14  is similar to that of a rapidly rotating bar , producing an apparently solid body - type rotation curve ( e.g. zhao 1996 ) .",
    "we search for the combination of @xmath103 , @xmath115  and @xmath116  that best reproduces the observed @xmath117  variation . the sensitivity of proper motion to intrinsic circular velocity decreases when motion is largely along the line of sight , as occurs near the meridional plane for our line of sight .",
    "additionally , the most dramatic change in the balance of components occurs over a relatively narrow range in line of sight distance @xmath110 , so that our chosen binning scheme ( which preserves information on the intrinsic stellar density ) results in relatively few bins over a complicated velocity variation and formally precise fitting is difficult .",
    "we thus impose the additional condition that the @xmath14  trend on near and far - sides of the bulge be similar . finally , we restrict ourselves to @xmath101  within 1@xmath90  of the value determined geometrically by eisenhauer et al .",
    "this artificially simple model does reproduce the observed variation of @xmath117  with distance reasonably well , adopting @xmath118  km s@xmath1 , @xmath119  kpc and @xmath120  kpc ( figure [ f_rotcurve ] ) . in agreement with zhao et al .",

    "our stellar rotation curve from proper motions agrees qualitatively with that recovered from a sample of radial velocities of @xmath17  and @xmath18  giants across a swath at @xmath122  ( with 90 - 110 stars per field ; figure 3 of rich et al 2007 ) .",
    "the circular speed inflection of rich .",

    "thus , our turning point at @xmath119  kpc is entirely consistent with that of rich et al.(2007 ) , suggesting cylindrical , non solid - body rotation .",
    "while the apparent departure points from solid body - like rotation agree with radial velocity and proper motion studies , the amplitude of @xmath115  towards which both circular speed measurements trend at high galactocentric radii , differ from each other by about a factor two .",
    "we found in section [ ss_recov ] that the metallicity , age and binarity uncertainties tend to produce @xmath115  roughly half that of the intrinsic value .",
    "therefore , our circular speed curve is fully consistent with that of the rich et al .",
    "( 2007 ) radial velocity survey in both turning point and velocity amplitude .",
    "because of the high intrinsic velocity scatter , we are not able to set fine limits on the degree of any disparity , however it seems clear that highly eccentric average stellar orbits are not consistent with our data .",
    "we note in passing that the circular speed curve of the ism does not provide a check of this discrepancy , as it measures the circular speed of a population with a definite , well - defined pattern speed of @xmath8200 - 230 km s@xmath1  at the galactocentric radii of interest",
    "( e.g. burton & liszt 1992 ) .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the stellar circular speed curve , which measures the average of a population with high intrinsic velocity dispersion and likely several sub - populations ( which may include a population on _ retrograde _ orbits ; e.g. zhao et al 1994 ) .",
    "the importance of measured mean velocity on the mixing of populations is also evident in the behaviour of @xmath14  at nearby distances , which rises to rather more modest values than the @xmath8220 km s@xmath1  pattern speed of the disk ( figure [ f_rotcurve ] ) .",
    "when binned to increase signal , @xmath124  exhibits an apparent change in sign about either the @xmath125  distance or the distance of maximum density ( figure [ fig_obs ] , upper right panel ) , with peak to peak amplitude @xmath126  mas yr@xmath1roughly 10 times lower than the switch in @xmath117  .",
    "such a trend is in line with that expected due to solar reflex motion ( vieira et al .",

    "the @xmath4  velocity ellipse is of great interest to bulge kinematics as ( i ) it may provide a further discriminant between bulge stellar populations , and ( ii ) within a given population it carries information about the structure of the potential in the _ z _ direction ( e.g. kuijken 2004 ) .",
    "previous studies have been inconclusive on this matter ; zhao et al .",

    "curiously , their proper motion covariance is roughly constant within measurement error across a range of different sight lines , which might argue against projection effects .",
    "however because the acs / hrc was used in their survey and the exposures were comparatively short , tracing the tilt of the velocity ellipse as a function of distance along the line of sight is difficult from their data because far fewer objects are traced per apparent distance bin than with acs / wfc .",
    "we remind the reader that a non - tilted stellar population can easily exhibit a tilted velocity ellipsoid if stars are being selected in a small region of space , even if the potential is spherical ( e.g. binney & tremaine 1994 ) .",
    "the best way to use the tilt of the velocity ellipsoid is probably to select objects closest to the meridional plane from multiple sight - lines ; this requires datasets of sufficient depth to be confident that enough objects in the meridional plane can indeed be selected .",
    "the baade s window datasets of kuijken & rich ( 2002 ) , newly complemented with the acs / wfc observations of the champlane project ( e.g. van den berg et al .",
    "2006 ) , constitute a good example of the type of dataset useful for such an approach ( see also the discussion in kuijken 2004 ) .",
    "existing models compare the shape of the depth - integrated velocity ellipse at different lines of sight ( e.g. kozowski et al .",
    "2006 ; rattenbury et al .",
    "2007a , b , c ; see also vieira et al .",
    "it would be of great interest to trace the tilt variation with depth of the velocity ellipsoid as a function of metallicity ; if there is indeed a separate stellar population exhibiting a tilt with respect to the majority of the bulge objects , perhaps accompanying the tilted gas ( burton & liszt 1992 ) , such a population may be of a newer generation and thus differ in metallicity from the rest of the bulge stellar population . the study of soto et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed little significant difference between the tilts of the @xmath4  ellipsoids near the rotation axis of the bulge , as a function of metallicity .",
    "however , as we have shown , the @xmath4  velocity ellipsoid shows significant tilt variation with distance , so the depth - integrated velocity ellipsoid of a small population of objects should be treated with some caution .",
    "unfortunately , metallicity information for a large number of proper motion stars in our field is not yet available .",
    "wfc3 will be the ideal instrument to constrain the metallicity of our tracer stars through multi - filter imaging observations .",
    "having constrained the proper motion ellipse for the disk and bulge populations as a function of distance , we are in a position to estimate the relative contributions of disk and bulge to our field , and thus the degree of contamination of the disk to the clean - bulge sample we will extract using the proper motions .",
    "the uncertain binary fraction in the bulge makes extrication of the bulge population from the disk difficult from the cmd ( see also kuijken & rich 2002 ) , so we turn to the vector point diagram to estimate the relative contributions of the two populations . direct evaluation of the stellar density as a function of distance breaks down at apparent distances nearer to the sun than the innermost spiral arm because the distance - estimate breaks down from differential reddening .",
    "furthermore , direct fitting to the vector point diagram is challenging due to the high overlap between the populations ; in experiments , simulated populations were very difficult to reproduce by such a procedure .",
    "we take a simpler approach : we first assume the superposition of populations along the line of sight can be approximated with a pair of 2d gaussians , and rely on the symmetry of these distributions to correct the bulge population for the contamination induced by the disk .",
    "the number of points within the 0.7@xmath90  ellipse of each population is evaluated to avoid counting objects twice due to overlap of regions in proper motion space .",
    "because of the high overlap , the estimated population within each region is corrected by the expected contribution from the other population ( figure [ f_fbulge ] ) ; the result is a `` raw '' disk - fraction of 11.5@xmath145 .",
    "the discrepancy between this value and the intrinsic value is assessed through simulation ; using the distance - dependent proper motion ellipses constrained previously , we simulate populations with input disk fraction and assess the difference between the value returned by this process , and the value input ( figure [ f_fbulge ] ) ; this leads to a true value @xmath146  for the disk fraction among our population with proper motion measurements .      to select a clean - bulge sample ,",
    "we modify slightly the kinematic selection criteria of kuijken & rich ( 2002 ) ; we use a cut on longitudinal proper motion @xmath84  and on proper motion measurement - errors @xmath147 , but discard cuts on @xmath85  because bulge and disk show similar latitudinal motion ( figures [ f_short ] and [ fig_hess ] ) .",
    "the proper motion error is an estimate of the measurement scatter ; this estimate does _ not _ take into account any bias in the measurement due to nearby brighter objects .",
    "for this reason , we further impose a cut on the crowding measure @xmath60  ( section [ s_sigma ] and figure [ f_qual ] ) ; we choose to keep objects with @xmath148 .    to set the proper motion cut - off , we return to the population above the msto to find the value of @xmath84  at which the disk contribution is low but the cut not so severe that too few objects are retained to be useful .",
    "we use the same selection regions as figure [ f_short ] to produce nominal `` disk '' and `` bulge '' populations .",
    "the `` disk '' population is markedly asymmetric in @xmath84 .",
    "indeed , this population is best fit with a two - component model , of which the one with high positive centroid proper motion ( @xmath149  mas yr@xmath1 ) , is identified with the disk ( hereafter the `` true - disk '' population ) .",
    "the component with centroid proper motion consistent with zero ( figure [ f_strag ] , top ) , is indistinguishable from the single component that is needed to fit the @xmath84  distribution of the bulge population above the msto ( figure [ f_strag ] , bottom ) , indicating some bulge / disk overlap in the `` disk '' region of the cmd .",
    "the proper motion cut @xmath150  mas yr@xmath1  of kuijken & rich ( 2002 ) lies approximately 2.9@xmath90  from the center of the true - disk distribution , so only about 0.19% of disk objects have @xmath151  mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "we thus adopt @xmath152  mas yr@xmath1  as our proper motion cutoff . to ensure that proper motions in the clean - bulge sample are measured to at least @xmath49  significance",
    ", we impose the proper motion error cutoff @xmath153  mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "this leaves 15,323 objects kinematically associated with the bulge ( figure [ f_bulge ] ) .",
    "because we have set our @xmath84  cutoff with reference to disk objects above the msto , our cutoff is not affected by the small contribution of evolved disk stars to the bulge rgb in the cmd ( vieira et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we now examine the contamination due to non - bulge stars that would pass these kinematic cuts .",
    "the disk makes up approximately 14% of the stars with measured proper motions , while 81,140 of the 187,346 objects with proper motion measurements show errors @xmath153  mas yr@xmath1 . the likely disk contamination to our proper motion - selected sample is therefore 81,140@xmath580.14@xmath580.0019=22  objects .",
    "thus perhaps 0.14% of the `` clean - bulge '' sample may in reality be disk objects .",
    "the galactic halo also provides a small contaminant ; integrating the bahcall & soneira ( 1984 ) models along the line of sight predicts @xmath154  halo objects in the acs / wfc field of view .",
    "the halo shows proper motion dispersion @xmath155  mas yr@xmath1  ( binney & merrifield 1998 , with distance @xmath110  in kpc ) , about a proper motion zeropoint similar to the bulge . we thus expect perhaps 40% of halo objects to pass our proper motion cuts , or @xmath156  objects .",
    "thus , the handful of objects high above the main sequence ( visible in figure [ f_bulge ] ) are probably halo stars , and can later be easily excised from the sample by position in the cmd .",
    "so the total contamination due to non - bulge stars in our clean - bulge sample , is of order 22 + 9 = 31 of 15,323 objects .",
    "isochrone - fitting to the bulge population is complicated by several factors .",
    "the extinction curve along the line of sight is not well - constrained , may vary spatially over the acs / wfc field of view , and may be anomalous ( sumi et al . 2004 ) , making dereddening challenging .",
    "the binary fraction of the bulge is unknown , causing an unknown systematic between single - star isochrones and the observed population .",
    "in addition , very few alpha - enhanced isochrones exist for metallicities greater than + 0.5 . we therefore defer detailed fitting of the bulge isochrone for future work and content ourselves with a visual comparison to vandenberg isochrones that have been transformed using the adopted bulge extinction and distance in the manner described by brown et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .    to estimate the best - fitting bulge sequence ,",
    "a median bulge population was estimated by binning the clean - bulge population along the isochrone ( figure [ f_bulge ] ) .",
    "because the uncertain binary fraction is not significant above the msto , we use the bulge - only cmd in this region to assess the spread in age and metallicity that overlap the observed range of colors .",
    "the 10gyr , alpha - enhanced solar - metallicity isochrone of sahu et al ( 2006 ) is replaced by a slightly older population at 11 gyr ; this better reproduces the median population .",
    "isochrones corresponding approximately to @xmath157  in both metallicity and age encompass most of the color variation along the post - msto bulge population . a very young , very metal - poor isochrone ( [ fe / h]=-1.009 , 5 gyr ) overlaps the outliers along the bulge rgb ; younger , more metal - poor isochrones are not consistent with the clean - bulge population ( figure [ f_bulge ] ) . the transformed isochrones",
    "do not reproduce an apparently metal - rich , old population visible at the red edge of the post - msto bulge sequence ; this might be due to regions with higher extinction than our mean adopted value of e(b - v)=0.64 .",
    "cohen et al .",
    "( 2008 ) recently compiled metallicities of a selection of main - sequence objects in the bulge that had been sufficiently amplified by microlensing to permit abundance analysis with comparable precision to the more traditionally - used giants ( see also minniti et al .",
    "the three objects in their sample show @xmath158\\sim+0.3 $ ] , leading to the claim that a random sample of bulge giants should be less metal - rich than a similar sample from the main - sequence , perhaps due to highly metal - rich objects losing so much mass that they never undergo the helium flash and evolve along a different track to the rest of the tracer giants ( cohen et al .",
    "we find no support for this hypothesis ; allowing for the uncertain binary frequency which affects the main - sequence far more than the bulge rgb , the metallicities of the giants and main - sequence samples are consistent with each other .",
    "more quantitative exploitation of the clean - bulge sample to constrain the star formation history of the bulge is beyond the scope of this article , and will be reported elsewhere .      within a few magnitudes above saturation , a population is visible with a disk - like location in the cmd ( blueward of and brighter than the bulge msto ) but with bulge - like proper motions ( figure [ fig_hess ] ; particularly obvious in @xmath84 , but also visible in @xmath42 ) .",
    "when we apply the kinematic cuts to extract a likely clean - bulge sample , 72 objects remain in this region of the cleaned cmd ( figure [ f_strag ] ) . as the halo is a somewhat evolved population , its objects",
    "are not expected to lie in this region of the cmd , and with an estimated 22 disk contaminants within the entire clean - bulge sample , at least 69% of this population must consist of bulge objects .",
    "this population may consist of very young , very metal - poor objects , although how such objects would form is not clear , and indeed isochrones younger than about 5gyr , which would be required to describe the brightest , bluest objects in this population , are not consistent with the cmd below the msto ( figure [ f_bulge ] ) .",
    "the alternative is that a significant fraction of these objects may be bulge blue stragglers ; their location in the cmd overlaps with the region such objects are expected to occupy ( e.g. sarajedini 1992 ) .",
    "further details of these objects will be reported in a separate communication ( clarkson et al .",

    "when we overplot the best - fitting mean - bulge and mean - disk proper motion contours , we find an apparent grouping of four objects within the 1@xmath90  contour of the disk , and all but two of the rest within the @xmath159  bulge contour ( figure [ f_scand ] ) .",
    "furthermore , the object sweeps-04 , which lies well within the 1@xmath90  ellipse of the disk population , resides on the upper disk sequence ( sahu et al .",
    "2006 ) , where disk stars are expected to dominate however all objects are also within the 2@xmath90  ellipse of the bulge population",
    ".      we use the angular distribution of candidates in proper motion space to assess kinematic membership of the sweeps candidates . in @xmath160  space , let @xmath161  be the counter - clockwise angle between the major axis of the best - fit bulge ellipse and the line joining the center of the best - fit bulge ellipse to the @xmath162-th candidate . the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath161  is then used as an indicator of the angular distribution of the sweeps candidates in proper motion space .",
    "should a large number of candidates reside in the disk , one would expect a sharp steepening in the cdf near @xmath163 , the angle between the major axis of the bulge ellipse and the center of the disk distribution ( figure [ f_candkin ] ) .",
    "alternatively , if all sixteen candidates were bulge objects , then the cdf would be a straight line ; no angle @xmath161 would be preferred .",

    "is computed between the trial and the observed distribution , yielding the associated formal probability that the sweeps candidates and the trial dataset are both realisations of the same probability distribution .",
    "this process is repeated for @xmath164 trial datasets .",
    "this test is repeated for differing sizes of disk contribution @xmath165  to the total population ( for @xmath166 ) and the formal probability that the sweeps sample matches the distribution using each @xmath165  is recovered .    to maximize use of available information",
    "we have also applied the 2d kolmogorov - smirnov test to the set of positions in ( @xmath82 ) space of all the candidates .",
    "we use the implementation in numerical recipes ( press et al .",
    "1992 ; see also metchev & grindlay 2002 ) . in two dimensions",
    "the equivalent k - s statistic @xmath167  is a function of the input distribution .",
    "we thus evaluate the significance of the maximum @xmath167  at each disk fraction @xmath165  using monte carlo simulations .",
    "this produces an equivalent significance curve as a function of @xmath165 ( figure [ f_candkin ] ) .",
    "although the most probable disk population @xmath165  differs slightly between the two tests , both are consistent ( at @xmath159 ) with a disk population in the range ( @xmath168 ) .",
    "if the fraction of stars hosting jovian planets with periods less than 4.2 days were identical between disk and bulge , we would expect the planet candidates to follow the same disk / bulge distribution as the stars in general .",
    "our kinematic analysis would then suggest 14% of planet candidates - two candidates - would reside in the disk .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the actual distribution of candidate kinematics .",
    "however , the sample of sweeps transit planet candidates is too small to draw meaningful conclusions about the fraction of planets in the disk versus that of the bulge . because we can not state that the fraction of planet candidates in disk and bulge are inconsistent with each other",
    ", we can not make any claims about the consistency or otherwise of the fraction of stars hosting planets between the disk and bulge .",
    "any inference on the true planet - host fraction in the bulge then reflects our ignorance of the true ratio of astrophysical false positives to true planets ; we restrict ourselves to upper and lower bounds .",
    "considering the likely population of stellar triples , grazing - incidence stellar binaries and low - mass stellar companions , sahu et al .",
    "( 2006 ) estimate the maximum rate of astrophysical false - positives among the candidates , of 9/16 , or 56% .",
    "we remind the reader that this is probably a conservative upper limit , as no such false - positives were found in the similar 47 tuc analysis ( gilliland et al .",
    "2000 ; see sahu et al .",
    "2006 for further discussion of this issue ) .",
    "thus the lower bound on the fraction of true planets among the candidates , is 44% ; the upper bound 100% , predicting 6 - 14 true detected planets in the bulge .",
    "taking the detection efficiency , period distribution and the probability of transit due to random orbital inclinations into account , the frequency of stars hosting jovian planets with periods shorter than 4.2 days was estimated to be 0.42% ( sahu et al .",
    "the 6 - 14 true detected planets then imply an extra uncertainty of perhaps a factor of two , since the planet frequency consistent with observations depends not only on the fraction of true planets but also the actual period , radius , transit phasing , and host brightness of each planet .",
    "we ask if the sub - population of five planet - host candidates with periods less than one day ( the `` ultra - short period planets '' , or uspp ; sahu et al .",
    "2006 ) themselves are preferentially located in the disk or bulge .",
    "here there is no obvious correlation between period and membership - two uspp fall within the 1@xmath90  ellipse of the best - fit disk , three fall within the 1@xmath90  ellipse of the best - fit bulge , and all are within 2@xmath90  of the best - fit bulge .",
    "thus the uspp do not show any preferred kinematic association compared to the non - uspp candidates ; the best that can be said is that the uspp as a family are unlikely to _ all _ be disk objects .",
    "we have measured proper motions for @xmath169  objects within the sagittarius low - reddening window towards the bulge ( @xmath170 ) , and used them to extract a clean clean - bulge sample of 15,323 objects - a sample roughly a factor four larger than that afforded by wfpc2 across a six - year interval ( kuijken & rich 2002 ) .",
    "this clean - bulge sample contains perhaps 31 contaminants from both disk and halo , making it the purest bulge population ever isolated .",
    "constructing a median stellar sequence from this bulge sample , we find that an 11 gyr isochrone best represents the bulge population , with most of the variation along the bulge subgiant branch falling within the range @xmath158=0.0 \\pm 0.4 $ ]  and age @xmath171  gyr . use of this sample to inform bulge age studies , in conjunction with extensive completeness tests , will be the subject of future reports .",
    "work along these lines is particularly exciting when we consider the parallel nicmos observations we have undertaken , for which similar selection should be possible and which brings the possibility of tracing the bulge initial mass function to the neighborhood of the hydrogen - burning limit .",
    "the large number of stars with proper motion measurements allows kinematic features to be resolved in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "we construct the @xmath4  velocity ellipse as a function of line of sight distance , demonstrating that its properties are quite sensitive to the distance to the objects under consideration .",
    "finally , we use its proper motion analogue to attempt to classify the sweeps planetary candidates by kinematic membership with bulge or disk .",
    "the proper motion distribution of the candidates is consistent with the division of the stellar population between bulge and disk , but the candidate population is too small to draw further conclusions .",
    "we find no evidence that ultra short period planet ( uspp ) candidates are preferentially associated with the disk ; instead we can only claim that the distribution is entirely inconsistent with _ all _ the uspp originating in the disk .",
    "although the metallicities of the majority of our targets are unknown ( with the exception of the bright objects , largely above the msto , for which vlt spectroscopy has been possible ) , the large number of objects with accurate proper motions allows the distance - uncertainty due to metallicity to be overcome by virtue of a sample containing @xmath0500 objects per bin .",
    "armed with photometric distances and therefore mean transverse velocities for our distance - bins , we produce an independent determination of the stellar circular speed curve @xmath121 .",
    "although the sampling of this rotation curve is relatively sparse , we clearly detect a transition away from solid body - like rotation at galactocentric radius @xmath172kpc , in line with evidence from radial velocities . within the uncertainties of the distance estimates",
    "we have used , our limiting circular speed at large radius is consistent with that from radial velocity measurements . with",
    "position - estimate dispersions reaching the 2 - 3_milli-_pixel level ( section [ s_pm ] ) , we are near the limit of position - measurement with current hst instrumentation .",
    "the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the bulge and disk nevertheless makes kinematic classification of object groups with few members difficult .",
    "as the bulge is likely a superposition of multiple stellar populations ( e.g. zoccali et al . 2003 ) , the intrinsic dispersion problem might be overcome if populations can be separated by metallicity on a star - by - star basis ( c.f .",

    "two approaches have in the past been taken to obtain proper motions from two different - depth epochs of observations of crowded stellar fields ( at least one of which is dithered ) , both with some success .",
    "the key difference lies in the production of the master - list of positions from the deeper epoch .",
    "the first approach is to stack the deepest - epoch images and build the master - list from the image stack .",
    "this takes advantage of the subpixel dithers to produce a ( usually ) twice - oversampled superimage , from which deep positions can be obtained ; the psf is well - sampled in the resulting superimage and thus the object - centers are better constrained than the individual input images .",
    "this approach was used quite successfully by richer et al .",
    "( 2004a , 2004b ) when separating members of m4 from the rest of the field .",
    "the second approach is to measure positions on each image individually amd combine the measurements with sigma - clipping to produce the master - list .",
    "positions are measured in the raw frame of each image ( the _ _ flt  _ frame ) , using a highly - supersampled model for the  effective psf  ( the instrumental psf as recorded by the detector , or epsf ) , with a perturbation scaled to the data to account for focus - breathing .",
    "this usually allows the measurement of positions from the individual images to higher accuracy than possible from an epsf constructed from the data itself ( anderson & king 2006 ) , because the observations used to produce the library epsf are rather better sampled than most program observations .",
    "our dataset is exceptionally well - sampled , so whether this advantage should hold here was less clear when embarking upon the reductions for this project .",
    "we thus tried both approaches for this dataset to allow a side - by - side comparison of the two methods and picked the winner for further evaluation of proper motions .",
    "positions in the second - epoch are mapped onto positions in the master - list built from the epoch-1 image stack . mutual misalignment between images in the two epochs",
    "means the epoch-2 images can not be directly evaluated onto the super - image for comparison . in this approach ,",
    "images in the less well - populated epochs are _ not _ stacked together before position determination as there are too few images in each epoch to optimise the stacking ; instead , each individual input image provides a separate estimate of the proper motion for each object . because frame - to - master offsets are likely to be of a high order , image - regions of size 1600 @xmath581600 twice - oversampled pixels ( so @xmath173 )",
    "are used to simplify the transformation required ( including a 200-pix buffer at the frame edges where transformations will be least well - fit ) ; each region contains @xmath87000 unsaturated stars in the master - list , of which @xmath860% are at @xmath174 .    the optimal transformation from the master - image to each individual second - epoch image",

    "positions are then found in both the input and the transformed master - image , and compared directly to produce proper motions . the result is a separate estimate of the proper motion for each input image , for each postage - stamp subregion .",
    "cosmic - rays and other artefacts are weeded out at the stage of proper motion estimate - collation by sigma - clipping ( c.f .",
    "sahu , anderson , & king 2002 ) .",
    "the alternative approach , producing the master - list by combining measurements from each individual image within an epoch , is preferable if the epsf in _ _ flt  _ space is well - enough constrained that its errors are smaller than those introduced due to the small spatial shifting of flux in the production of the epoch-1 superimage .",
    "the observations used for the epsf of anderson & king ( 2006 ; see also anderson & king 2003 ) provided a 4@xmath58 supersampled , spatially - dependent super - sampled psf model in _",
    "_ flt  _ space , as well as a distortion solution that transforms raw positions into positions on the sky .",
    "the distortion is accurate to @xmath81% of a pixel ( anderson & king 2006 ) .",
    "thus , for the epoch of the calibration observations , positions and fluxes can be measured to high accuracy _ and _ transformed to a distortion - free frame using this solution .",
    "we compare the two methods of proper motion determination by the proper - motion distributions each produces over the same region of the image ; in this case the @xmath175  surrounding the exoplanet candidate - host sweeps-13 .",
    "the resulting proper motion distribution along pixel - x coordinate shows width @xmath126  mas yr@xmath1  ( 0.008 acs / wfc pix over two years ) greater when determined using the epoch-1 stack than from the image - to - image estimates , with the latter showing closer agreement to the previously - published wfpc2-based proper motions determined by kuijken & rich ( 2002 ) . the stack - based approach thus provides proper motion estimates roughly seven percent less precise than the image - to - image approach ( figure [ fig : compar ] ) .",
    "the cause of this discrepancy is most likely the combination of deep - epoch images into the image - model ; the convolution of input images onto the master - scene has caused flux to be slightly re - arranged ; while the absolute number of electrons associated with a given object is preserved ( so the image - model is still ideal for photometry ) , the distribution within the region occupied by the star has been altered ( figure [ f_system ] ) .",
    "the magnitude of this systematic is reduced somewhat by the blot process ; while it can be mitigated in principle by re - fitting the epsf to the postage stamp for each region in each image , there is no guarantee that any spatial variation of this shifting can be swept into the epsf - fit .",
    "for this reason , all proper motions we report here are based on the image - to - image approach .",
    "for roughly 6% of objects , the techniques of section [ s_sigma ] fail to converge on a single mean position estimate , but produce a bimodal estimate .",
    "the majority of these objects ( 86% , or 5.2% of the total population in the field of view ) show low separation ( @xmath176  pix ) between the two peaks in the estimate , and upon visual inspection usually consist of a cloud of points ( the main peak ) plus a trail ( within which the secondary peak resides ; figure [ f_bimod ] , top ) . for a significant fraction of this bimodal population , the line joining the two peaks shows preferential alignment to the direction towards the nearest neighbor that is at least as bright as the object itself ( figure [ f_bimod2 ] , right ) .",
    "thus , we conclude that the trailing in these position estimates is due to the influence of a bright neighbor with slightly incorrect subtraction",
    ".    objects with separation between peaks greater than 0.15  pix make up the remaining 14% of the bimodal objects ( or 0.8% of the total population ) , and generally show more well - separated clusters of position estimates .",
    "in contrast to the low - separation bimodal objects , the reported separation between peaks is close to the apparent separation between islands upon visual inspection ( figure [ f_bimod ] , left bottom ) . also unlike the low - separation bimodal objects , the position - angle between the peaks shows no relation to the direction to the nearest bright neighbor ( figure [ f_bimod2 ] , left ) .",
    "however , for this population , the nearest bright neighbor is on average closer than for the population as a whole .",
    "it thus appears clear that a significant fraction of both classes of object with bimodal position estimates , represent different manifestations of the effects of crowding by stellar neighbors .",
    "the former class of bimodal object is found all throughout the sample diagram , while the high - separation class of bimodal object coincides with the population showing anomalously high position - scatter during the second pass of the photometry ( figure [ fig_rms ] ) .",
    "where two clouds of points are produced for an object , we select the cloud with the highest number of measurements ; visual inspection suggests that in most cases this clump shows the lower scatter of the two clouds and is interpreted as the true position of the star ( figure [ f_bimod ] , right ) .",
    "this selection takes place at the same time as sigma - clipping when the master - list is updated after each pass of the photometry ( section [ s_sigma ] ) .",
    "the resulting master position - list now shows rather small internal variation ( figure [ fig_rms ] ) .",
    "we remind the reader that when selecting a clean - bulge sample , our selection on the crowding - index @xmath60  will remove most of the bimodal objects from consideration .",
    "acs / wfc has its horizontal shift registers along the detector - x direction at the top and bottom of the detector , so that during readout charge is transferred in the positive y - direction ( wfc1 ) and negative y - direction ( wfc2 ) .",
    "it thus incorporates a charge transfer efficiency ( cte ) effect ; the signal measured from a star is dependent on the detector - y position of that star due to the number of transfers of the signal during readout .",
    "this effect may be observed in a number of ways ; the same scene may be observed at two different integration times or pointings and the change in magnitude or position observed plotted against detector - y position ( e.g. riess & mack 2004 ) . or , a sharply - defined feature in the cmd may be measured and its variation over the ccd tracked if there are enough stars in the frame ( e.g. brown et al .",
    "the effect on measured magnitudes for acs / wfc is a `` v''-shaped pattern in instrumental magnitude versus detector - y ; objects nearest the chip - gap are farthest from the shift registers and thus suffer the greatest signal decrease during readout .",
    "recently it has been pointed out that cte can also affect the detected position of stars on the detector ; the signature behaviour is a trend in measured position with detector - y , with a discontiunity at the inter - chip gap ( kozhurina - platais et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "we thus searched for evidence of any cte - effects in our data to assess its impact on proper motion measurements .",
    "brown et al .",
    "( 2005 ) used the @xmath177-mag difference between the horizontal branch and subgiant branch to probe this distribution and concluded that the tendency of the high stellar background to fill pixel wells was reducing cte effects to beneath the 5  mmag level .",
    "this process is difficult to apply to our data because similar features with low intrinsic dispersion are not available in the faint magnitude regime at which cte is expected to be significant ; when following a similar procedure to assess the magnitude spread as a function of position we see largely random variation with detector - y which we attribute to intrinsic variation in the scene .",
    "instead , we establish that cte effects are present in the sweeps data by measuring the difference in instrumental magnitude between 339s and 20s exposures within the 2004 epoch .",
    "because the cte effect is more pronounced for fainter objects , it will affect measurements in the short exposures more than the long ; thus the v - shaped cte fingerprint is expected .",
    "indeed , it is clearly observed ( figure [ f_cte ] ) , at the 20 - 30mmag level and with an amplitude @xmath62  that increases with object faintness .",
    "next , we compare instrumental magnitude measurements of objects observed at nearly identical exposure times between the two observation epochs ( 339s in 2004 and 345s in 2006 ) .",
    "the cte signal is again clearly visible at the 2 - 10mmag level , and also increases in amplitude @xmath62  with increasing object faintness .",
    "this is a _ differential _",
    "cte measurement , in that the cte of the detector has degraded somewhat in the two years between measurements ( figure [ f_cte2 ] ) .    to estimate the cte contribution to astrometry and thus proper motion measurements , we compare position - measurements between 339s and 20s exposures in the 2004 epoch .",
    "this is then scaled by the size of the inter - epoch cte magnitude effect to estimate the contribution of cte to the proper motion measurements .",
    "positions from the 20s exposures were transformed to the median frame of the 2004s exposures using local transformations ( section [ sub_pm ] ) , with objects in likely - bulge regions of the cmd and at instrumental magnitude ( @xmath178 ) in the 339s epoch used as tracers for the transformation .",
    "a linear trend was fit to the position - difference @xmath179  as a function of detector - y ( polynomials were also tried but found to give no advantage over the linear trends ) and the range of @xmath179  across each chip measured .",
    "errors on the trends were estimated by simulating a large number of trials assuming no intrinsic variation with detector - y and computing the standard deviation of recovered @xmath179  ranges . the astrometric cte effect noted by kozhurina - platais et al .",
    "( 2007 ) is clearly present in the 2004 epoch ( figure [ f_cte_pos1 ] ) .",
    "the size of the trend increases with target faintness compared to the tracer stars .",
    "no trend is detected in the tracer - star magnitude range , while the trend reaches 10  millipix in the ( @xmath180 ) range .",
    "assuming the astrometric cte signal to scale with the magnitude cte signal , we thus expect an astrometric cte signal between the deep observations in the 2004 and 2006 epochs of perhaps 0.5 - 3  millipix at the faintest instrumental magnitudes",
    ". however , when we search for such a signal in the position - differences between epochs , such a signal is not detectable above the scatter caused by _",
    "intrinsic _ motion of the stars themselves between the two epochs ( figure [ f_cte_pos ] ) .",
    "thus the predicted astrometric effect due to _ differential _ cte is less than 0.2 mas , and thus not a significant source of error .",
