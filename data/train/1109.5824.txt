    "black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrbs ) are binary star systems that are luminous in the x - ray part of the spectrum .",

    "generally , at the high / soft state , with higher accretion rate , the accretion is dominantly via a standard thin disk extending to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) ( pringle & rees 1972 ; shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; mitsuda et al . 1984 ; frank et el .",

    "i.e. , the thin disk truncates at some radius off the isco ( rees et al .",

    "( 2007 ) . in this model , when the accretion rate decreases just below the transition rate between high / soft state and low / hard state , as a consequence of efficient evaporation , the thin disk truncates at a distance where the maximum evaporation rate occurs ( meyer et al .",

    "the size of the inner remnant disk is governed by the accretion rate .",
    "the geometry of the accretion flows are allocated as an inner disk and a much cooler outer disk , which are separated by an adaf .",
    "with decrease of the accretion rate , the inner disk shrinks and eventually vanishes completely at a certain accretion rate . the dynamical interaction between the inner disk and corona",

    "for the compton cooling of the corona , the upward hard photons escape from the corona directly ; the downward hard photons are partially reflected and partially absorbed by the underlying optically thick disk .",
    "the absorbed photons are reprocessed in the optically thick disk and remitted as a thermal emission providing the soft photons for the compton scattering in the corona .",
    "this procedure is iterated until a stable disk - corona system forms . in the vertical transition layer between the disk and corona",
    ", an equilibrium is established between the conductive flux from the upper corona , bremsstrahlung radiation , and vertical enthalpy flux .",
    "for a given distance from the black hole , a fraction of the disk gas is heated and evaporated to the corona when the conduction flux is too large to be radiated away . on the other hand , a certain amount of coronal gas",
    "is cooled down , condensing to the disk if the bremsstrahlung radiation is more efficient than the conduction . at accretion rates around a few percent of eddington value ,",
