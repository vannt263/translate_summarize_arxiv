    "in the present rapporteur s opinion , which is not always shared by other cosmic ray physicists , our knowledge of cosmic ray propagation and acceleration is only superficial and fragmentary now .",
    "essentially , even the identification of basic acceleration processes is unsure , as well as understanding of details of these processes acting in shocks and other supersonic flows , or in turbulent media .",
    "very nice fits of the proposed simple models to the observational data are quite often possible , but it is natural noting the fact that in many cases only single observational parameters are available , like the particle spectrum slope or the mean age of unstable nuclei .",
    "therefore , to reach further progress in this field an era of studying complicated and/or elaborated models must begin , supported by substantial effort to increase the measurements data base .",
    "perhaps this personal attitude can explain my choice of problems to be discussed in this report .",
    "below , results of approximately 90 papers are reported . to make a reference to a given paper i will use either the more traditional form with authors names plus the page number in the proceedings ( for clarity a symbol ` p. ' is given before the page number ) , or only the name he , og or sh , followed with the session number and the page number . in the first part of the present report , in section 2 presentations listed as the ones dealing with particle propagation",
    "are discussed ( all og 1.3 papers + og 1.2-p.1804 , p.1812 ) , while in the second part ( section 3 ) the acceleration papers ( all og 1.4 papers + og 2.3-p.2701 , p.2713 and 2.4-p.2742 ) are reviewed .",
    "then , a few final remarks are presented in the last section 4 .",
    "precise measurements of cosmic ray abundances and spectra by present day experiments like cris , scuba , ace , kaskade , in various energy ranges , allow much more detailed modelling of cosmic ray transport within our galaxy s magnetic field structure and inhomogeneous gas distribution .",
    "we start with a short reminder of the main observational facts related to these structures . later we summarize results on cosmic ray propagation , divided into parts ( subsections ) describing various aspects .",
    "selection of papers described in a given subsection is a somewhat arbitrary choice of the rapporteur .",
    "let us start with pointing out a few serious difficulties for any attempt to construct a realistic model of cosmic ray transport within our galaxy and on larger scales .",
    "all studies of cosmic ray interactions face the fact of an extremely inhomogeneous matter distribution in the galactic disk ( cf .",
    "ferrire 2001 ) . in our galaxy",
    "more than 50% of diffuse matter is confined to discrete ( molecular and cold neutral ) clouds within @xmath0% of the interstellar volume .",
    "these clouds are distributed close ( @xmath1 ) to the galactic plane , non - uniformly both in radial and azimuthal directions , where the molecular torus for @xmath2 kpc and the spiral arm concentrations , dominate respectively . with respect to those cold and dense clouds ,",
    "the density of the gaseous disk is 2 or 3 orders of magnitude lower , and additional 2 orders of magnitude lower densities are considered for the galactic halo . at the same time",
    "the gaseous disk and halo have more than one or , respectively , two orders of magnitude larger volumes .",
    "to model the cosmic ray propagation inside the galaxy and in the intergalactic space one needs sufficient information about the magnetic field structure , both the smooth large - scale component and the turbulent component responsible for particle scattering .",
    "a large ratio of the measured cosmic ray life time and the galaxy crossing time allows us to assume that the observed particle trajectories average over the galactic ( + halo ) volume and the simple approaches based on the diffusive equation with the _ effective _ vertical diffusion coefficient can properly reproduce the mean parameters ( age , abundances ) of cosmic ray transport at low energies . however , if one intends for example to reproduce a real spatial structure of the cosmic ray density or of the mean age or grammage of particles , more detailed information about particle trajectories may be required .",
    "unfortunately , there is far from full understanding of the magnetic field structure in space .",
    "numerous studies show quite complicated patterns , most often observed as a projection on the celestial sphere .",
    "the observed magnetic field structures like ` superbubbles ' have vertical scales comparable to the height of the galactic gaseous disk , or even extend farther away if pulled out with the forming wind ( cf .",
    "og 1.3 - 1924 ) .",
    "thus a complicated magnetic connectivity may be formed within the galactic volume leading to substantial ( ? ) variations of local properties of the cosmic ray population .    at present information about the intergalactic magnetic field",
    "is only fragmentary ( cf .",
    "kronberg 2001 ) , weakly constraining the propagation models of extremely high energy cosmic rays .",
    "both large scale relatively uniform and strong ( @xmath3 @xmath4 g ) supergalactic structures are considered as well as structures formed with the separate magnetized plasma blobs ejected from active galaxies during their cosmological evolution .",
    "a substantial amount of data accumulated on cosmic ray primary and secondary abundances allows modelling different aspects of particle propagation .",
    "the papers we consider in this section present interpretation of libeb abundances and ages ( og 1.3-p.1831 , p.1835 , p.1938 , p.1840 ,",
    "p.1937 ) , role of k - capture processes in cosmic ray propagation ( og 1.3-p.1844 ) , antiproton component ( og 1.3-p.1864 , p.1868 , p.1873 , p. 1877 ) and anti - particle related problems ( og 1.3-p.1880 , p.1872 ) , radioactive secondaries in cosmic rays ( og 1.3-p.1860 , p.1836 ) , some other aspects of cosmic ray propagation ( og 1.3-p.1892 , p.1896 ) .",
    "a number of presentations use simple propagation models to reproduce available measurements of cosmic ray abundances and ages . in some studies",
    "the cosmic ray data serve to impose limits on the model parameters , including important astrophysical issues of existence or not of the galactic wind and/or the role of particle re - acceleration in the interstellar medium . unfortunately , besides the above discussed complicated astrophysical scenario , which may be improperly described by simple leaky - box or diffusive ( + wind ) models , the present knowledge of interaction cross sections is frequently insufficient to allow for definitive conclusions . in most cases",
    "authors were able to reproduce the magnitude of the measured particle fluxes , but the energy dependence suggested by the model was in some cases different compared to the one seen in the measurements . nevertheless , let us note an interesting example of such a study .",
    "the radioactive electron capture isotopes can be used to investigate interstellar propagation of low energy cosmic rays due to the strong energy dependence of the surviving fractions in the interstellar medium .",
    "an interesting study intended to constrain particle reacceleration within the diffusive disk - halo model was presented by jones et al .",
    "( p.1844 ) , who considered the abundance modification of cr , v and ti isotopes by k - capture processes @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xmath6 @xmath9 .",
    "their results summarized in figure 1 show the importance of k - capture processes for such propagation study , but do not yield a solid conclusion on the role of the reacceleration process .",
    "the authors conclude that the statistical accuracy of the ace experiment itself is high enough to see a signature of reacceleration , however , the uncertainties in nuclear cross - sections are probably too large to conclude that a reacceleration process took place .",
    "a new perspective for investigations of the particle fragmentation processes within the galactic disk is an extensive numerical galprop code developed by moskalenko , strong and collaborators ( og 1.3-p.1836 , p.1868 , p.1942 , p.1964 ) .",
    "it solves the cosmic ray propagation equations on a spatial grid . in principle",
    "it allows one to consider several realistic factors in the modelling ( og 1.3-p.1942 ) , including  in its 2d or 3d version  a non - uniform magnetic field and an ambient gas structure , a wealth of particle interactions with the respective cross - sections , and/or realistic distribution of cosmic ray sources , as illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the proposed approach enables investigation of several characteristics of cosmic ray propagation and  at present  it is the best available tool to study cosmic ray abundances and ages . of course ,",
    "the approach is subject to the same problems with insufficient knowledge of interaction cross - sections , but it is able to check a substantial number of interaction channels and it can test the role of other factors influencing the cosmic ray propagation .    a few papers discussed constraints on the galactic propagation models based on antiproton measurements ( moskalenko et al .",
    "p.1868 , sina et al .",
    "p.1873 and molnar & simon p.1877 ) .",
    "difficulties met with the fits may indicate need for improving the propagation models considered .",
    "a number of interesting papers on physics of cosmic ray propagation discussed issues like diffusive propagation models in the galaxy ( og 1.3-p.1908 , p.1926 , p.1933 , p.1921 , p.1873 , p.1885 ) , some aspects of particle interaction with the turbulent medium ( og 1.3-p.1920 , p.1889 , p.1896 , p.1900 , p.1903 , p.1904 , p.1852 ) , parameters of the cosmic ray flux from a local supernova remnant ( og 1.3-p.1807 , p.1810 ) , parameters of galactic cosmic ray propagation ( og 1.3-p.1947 , p.1819 , p.1923 , p.1856 ) and information about recent developments in the above mentioned extensive numerical code to treat galactic cosmic ray propagation ( og 1.3-p.1942 ) .",
    "an increasing amount of accurate data on cosmic ray abundances and improving knowledge of the interstellar medium and the magnetic field in the galactic disk limit a role of exact solutions of the diffusion or diffusion - convection equation .",
    "nevertheless such solutions will always play an important role in qualitative understanding of particle transport and will provide good tests for checking accuracy of numerical codes .",
    "a set of such solutions for galactic cosmic ray transport was presented by shibata ( p.1908 , p.1926 , p.1933 ) and buesching et al .",
    "( p.1921 ) . a new approach to the cosmic ray transport considering the anomalous diffusion was studied in numerous papers of lagutin and collaborators ( p.1852 , p.1884 , p.1889 , p.1896 , p.1900 , p.1920 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the relation of the proposed analytic approach to the real conditions is at least unclear .",
    "the progress in the near future is expected to be based on numerical studies ( like still developing galprop - see og 1.3-p.1942 and fig .",
    "2 ) including a growing amount of data on the interstellar medium and new , more precise information about nuclear cross - sections .      several papers discussed features observed in the wide energy range spectrum , concentrating on the so called ` knee ' and ` ankle ' features ( og 1.2 - p.1804 , og 1.3-p.1979 , p.1995 , p.1968 ) , propagation of uhe cosmic rays and/or their possible galactic origin ( og 1.3-p.1972 , p.1976 , p.1999 , p.1991 , p.1951 ) , finally on energy losses of propagating particles ( og 1.3 - 1951 ) , in particular iron nuclei ( og 1.3-p.1987 ) .    studies of the wide range energy spectrum for the heavy cosmic ray component have concentrated for years on the features seen in the spectrum , in particular the knee at @xmath10 - @xmath11 ev and the ankle above @xmath12 ev , and the power law sections between them . a growing amount of kaskade data seems to confirm ( schatz he 1.02-p.76 , fig .",
    "3 ) earlier considerations of erlykin and wolfendale ( cf .",
    "og 1.2-p.1804 ) . based on the inhomogeneous data then available they noted a relatively sharp change of the spectrum inclination at the knee , incompatible with the hypothesis of distributed galactic sources with varying upper energy cut - off and the diffusive transport averaging these particle populations . additionally , discrete wavy features noted by these authors at the knee were also difficult to understand within the above model .",
    "as a simple solution for both these observational problems erlykin & wolfendale propose that our local cosmic ray spectrum is an averaged galactic spectrum modified by a single local source ( a supernova remnant ) . during the present conference they presented an extended discussion of several aspects of their improved model ( og 1.2-p.1804 ) , including particle anisotropy and temporal variations for a local supernova remnant ( og 1.3-p.1807 , p.1810 ) and its electron component ( og 1.2-p.1812 ) .",
    "the present growing evidence of reality of the mentioned spectral features makes their study an important one , opening a new phenomenology for the cosmic ray data .",
    "the question of primary uhe particles generating atmospheric showers in the energy range @xmath13 ev is still under debate .",
    "an interesting contribution to this discussion is presented by wibig & wolfendale ( p.1987 ) , who investigate propagation characteristics of ultra high energy heavy nuclei .",
    "they note that such nuclei interacting with the microwave background photons lose energy very slowly , mostly by gradual stripping of single nucleons from the original nucleus . in their modelling for a uniform source distribution in space and injection of high energy particles with 50% fe and 50% o , the observed distribution at earth extends to higher energies than the one for a pure proton injection ( fig.4 ) .",
    "a growing number of studies pointing at pulsar sources of @xmath14 ev iron nuclei ( see below ) makes this study of particular interest .      for cosmic ray electrons their possible relation to the gould s belt young stellar population",
    "was discussed in og 1.3-p.1912 and a local supernova source in og 1.2-p.1812 ( see also og 1.3-p.1964 ) , numerical modelling of the electron injection and acceleration was presented in og 1.3-p.1848 and its relation to the galactic magnetic field structure via radio astronomical observations was studied in og 1.3-p.1924 .",
    "processes of @xmath15-ray radiation in the galaxy were numerically modelled in og 1.3-p.1964 .    growing evidence of a possible local electron component from the gould s belt of recent star formation ( pohl et al .",
    "p.1912 ) or a local supernova remnant ( erlykin & wolfendale p.1812 ) becomes an option which enables one to explain the excess @xmath15-ray emission above 1 gev as a result of inverse - compton radiation of the electron component with a spatially varying spectral index .",
    "although inconclusive , the studies support the possibility that the cosmic rays observed at earth involve two components - the smooth large scale galactic distribution and the more or less local component due to sources situated nearby . to study such non - uniform electron distribution strong & moskalenko used numerical modelling ( cf .",
    "2 ) . due to radiation losses",
    "the obtained electron distribution can be more inhomogeneous than the one for protons of the same energy .",
    "an important issue for modelling the cosmic ray propagation is derivation ( measurements ! ) of interaction cross - sections .",
    "unfortunately , this important problem was discussed in only a few papers ( og 1.3-p.1955 , p.1956 , p.1960 ) , and does not represent the full range of the work done in this field .",
    "continued progress in studying the cosmic ray acceleration processes was represented in hamburg by a number of interesting contributions .",
    "a general impression one could draw from these presentations is that in the ` classic ' shock acceleration models , both non - relativistic and relativistic ones , there is still space for including effects which can substantially modify the acceleration process .",
    "we also note that only a few authors decided to study old , extremely important but difficult and time consuming problems of particle injection and the collisionless shock structure at the microscopic plasma level .",
    "two research groups discussed this issue for quasi - perpendicular shocks using similar _ particle in cell _",
    "( pic ) simulations ( schmitz et al .",
    "p.2022 , drury et al .",
    "the acceleration process is caused by ions reflected from the shock , which due to a two stream instability generate electrostatic fluctuations .",
    "complicated interaction of electrons with these waves leads to their acceleration , generating a power law distribution up to velocities much exceeding the initial ions velocity .",
    "schmitz et al . investigated the influence of the plasma beta on the acceleration efficiency and found that the low beta shocks were more efficient in accelerating electrons ( fig .",
    "5 ) . in my opinion",
    "the above approach , continuing a few earlier papers intended to understand the microphysics of the acceleration process , provides a promising attempt to reach real progress in the study of particle shock acceleration , surpassing relatively primitive test particle studies since the discovery of the diffusive shock acceleration process .      among various aspects of non - relativistic shock acceleration",
    "a number of presentations were based on hydrodynamical acceleration models ( og 1.4 - p.2010 , p.2018 , p.2046 , p.2050 , p.2088 ) , modelling of particle - wave interactions at the shock wave ( og 1.4-p.2054 ) , anomalous cosmic ray transport in perpendicular shocks ( og 1.4-p.2066 ) and numerical study of the ordinary diffusive shock acceleration ( og 1.4-p.2084 ) .",
    "let me note a few interesting results .",
    "malkov et al .",
    "( p.2010 ) considered non - linear particle acceleration at a supernova remnant shock wave .",
    "they studied the combined effect of acceleration non - linearity leading to the shock profile modification and propagation of alfvn waves that are responsible for particle confinement near the shock . in this process refraction effects in the upstream pre - compression of the flow lead to decreasing wave amplitude in the resonance range near the spectrum cut - off .",
    "as a result the upper energy limit of accelerated particles is also decreased ( cf .",
    "the discussed new effect provides an additional constraint on attempts to explain cosmic rays up to the knee as produced by snrs .",
    "another interesting study of wave propagation near the shock was presented by vainio ( p.2054 ) , who considered simple unmodified shocks , but derived exactly wave propagation under the shock conditions .",
    "the upstream cosmic ray generated waves , which move forward , in the same direction as the shock ( vainio describes these waves as having a cross - helicity = 1 ) , generate both forward and backward waves when transmitted downstream of the shock .",
    "a finite particle pressure downstream of the shock can modify the wave forward - backward asymmetry to the situation with waves propagating mostly backward . as a result the acceleration region with the large scattering centre compression ratio",
    "has finite width behind the shock , which regulates the acceleration efficiency .",
    "the computations are performed for parallel shocks , and are thus of limited validity , but point out a new factor influencing the acceleration process at small and medium mach number shocks .",
    "the role of realistic , oblique magnetic field configuration at the non - linear shock acceleration was studied by zakharian et al .",
    "( p.2018 ) , who considered a spherical supernova remnant shock wave expanding in the uniform ambient magnetic field .",
    "they solve ideal magnetohydrodynamic equations with the cosmic ray force term included and the kinetic equation for the cosmic ray distribution , including anisotropic diffusion and drifts in the magnetic field near the shock .",
    "the obtained spectra depend to a large degree on the local magnetic field structure , with a much larger cut - off energy near the ` equator ' with the quasi - perpendicular shock configuration . in their ` simple ' model",
    "the particle cut - off energy can differ along the shock by a factor @xmath16 , as presented at fig .",
    "it is worth to note , however , that for large amplitude turbulence near the shock this difference can be substantially smaller .",
    "particle fermi acceleration at perpendicular shocks depends to a large degree on particle ability to diffuse across the mean magnetic field , and , thus , on magnetic field line wandering in a turbulent medium near the shock .",
    "ragot ( p.2066 ) applied her computations of line wandering for different spectra of mhd turbulence , showing an anomalous diffusion behaviour depending on the considered spectrum , to evaluate the particle acceleration time scales for shocks with oblique magnetic fields .",
    "depending on the shock parameters , she found the possibility of large departures of the obtained time scales from the values derived in a traditional way .",
    "the considered processes of anomalous transport enable to explain variations of the radio flux from the supernova remnant sn1987a .",
    "several authors attempted to use monte carlo methods to study the acceleration process within the test particle approach ( og 1.4-p.2006 , p.2014 , 2026 , og 2.4-p.2742 , cf . a comment in appendix ) and including gas hydrodynamics ( og 1.4-p.2058 ) , an acceleration ` box model ' was extended to relativistic shocks ( og 1.4-p.2043 ) , a general discussion is included in og 1.4-p.2039 , finally , an attempt to discuss microphysics of the acceleration process was presented in og 2.3-p.2713 .",
    "the microphysics of the relativistic shock acceleration is an issue appearing to be essential for any reasonable study of energetic particle generation at such shocks . at the present meeting pohl et al .",
    "( p.2713 ) studied electrostatic instability at a parallel relativistic shock leading to particle acceleration and isotropization .",
    "their work performed with simple analytic means allows one to note the possibly complicated nature of the acceleration processes at such shocks .",
    "this study , accompanying a few other recently published papers , makes it clear that to achieve better understanding of the acceleration process at relativistic shocks one needs an immense amount of work devoted to studying the acceleration process collisionless microphysics .",
    "dermer ( p.2039 ) included in his talk a discussion of the particle acceleration in relativistic turbulence inevitably existing downstream of the shock .",
    "the second - order fermi acceleration in such high amplitude turbulence can be extremely fast and efficient .",
    "the process should be studied in more detail to make the dermer calculations more realistic , e.g. existence of long , high amplitude resonance waves important for acceleration of uhe cr particles can be questionable for relativistic shocks , as the shock generated waves are expected to be dominated by the short wave component .",
    "acceleration processes assumed to act in astrophysical objects were also discussed for jets ( og 1.4-p.2030 , p.2034 , og 2.3-p.2701 ) , pulsars ( og 1.4-p.2105 , p.2092 ) , active galactic nuclei ( og 1.4 - p.2100 ) , supergalactic structures ( og 1.4-p.2062 ) , dust acceleration for explaining the observed @xmath15-ray line width ( og 1.4-p.2077 ) .",
    "more general discussion was presented in og 1.4-p.2070 , p. 2074",
    ", a role of new physics with the lorentz symmetry violation was considered in og 1.4-p.2103 , p.2104 .",
    "giller & lipski ( p.2092 ) investigated a simple model of pulsar acceleration to model the galactic cosmic ray distribution at energies above @xmath17 ev .",
    "they assumed that the pulsar rotational energy is fully transferred into energetic particles .",
    "these particles are injected into the interstellar medium at the highest possible energy at a given phase of pulsar evolution ( i.e. the energy scale decreases when the pulsar rotation slows down and its magnetic field decays ) .",
    "thus the observed spectrum should be an average over the pulsar population .",
    "the authors show that the data on cosmic rays and pulsars within our galaxy are consistent with this model .",
    "an interesting study of observational effects related to dust grain shock acceleration measured by gamma - ray line shape was presented by kretschmer et al .",
    "( p.2077 ) .",
    "the observed @xmath18al @xmath19 mev line width of @xmath20 kev is explained by kinematic velocities of the bulk of aluminium atoms in the studied region containing young stars with powerful stellar winds and supernova remnant shock waves .",
    "the authors consider acceleration of dust grains to large velocities as parts of such flows , their destruction into individual nuclei after transmission downstream of the respective shock , and the velocity evolution of these nuclei afterwards .",
    "a long life - time of fast nuclei can explain the observed line widths .",
    "if the shock acceleration generates a population of even more energetic nuclei , a ` blue ' wing should accompany the thermal line , as can be tested in future observations .",
    "let me express a few impressions from my present work .",
    "the first is that it provided only a partial description of achievements on the propagation and acceleration issues at the 27th icrc because a substantial part of the work devoted to these problems was presented during the conference sh sessions .",
    "it seems to me that the present division , reflected partly in separate sets of journals , where the respective papers are published ( geophysical ones for the heliospheric studies , and astrophysical ones for investigation of a more distant space ) , is an obstacle for common research effort in the considered field .",
    "as clearly seen at this conference further progress in modelling cosmic ray galactic propagation requires substantial improvement of our knowledge of interaction cross sections , the magnetic field structure in the galaxy and local effects . until such progress occurs , of particular interest",
    "would be simultaneous study of propagation for large number of different particles ( various isotopes , antiprotons and electrons or positrons ) to get a larger number of constraints for parameters of the considered model .    in study of acceleration processes progress",
    "is to be expected from the detailed studies of ` microphysics ' of the acceleration process , considering details of collisionless shocks and mhd turbulence .",
    "in particular the processes of relativistic shock acceleration are far from being fully understood .",
    "however , even for the relatively well studied domain of non - relativistic shocks new processes were considered at this meeting showing sometimes qualitatively new possibilities .",
    "i am grateful to all authors , who provided figures presented in the present report .",
    "this work was supported by the _ komitet bada naukowych _ through the grant pb  258/p03/99/17  .",
    "let us recall why the monte carlo modelling of particle acceleration at relativistic shocks applying the method of _ discrete isotropic ( or large angle ) _ scattering of particle momentum leads to unphysical results .",
    "the first order fermi acceleration process involves particles wandering near the shock front and crossing it occasionally upstream or downstream .",
    "a particle transmitted upstream of the shock starts to move in front of it with the velocity component along the shock normal , @xmath21 , larger than the shock velocity with respect to the upstream medium ,      where @xmath15 is the upstream shock lorentz factor .",
    "here we consider relativistic shocks with @xmath23 .",
    "after the upstream perturbed magnetic field changes the particle momentum through a small angle @xmath24 with respect to the shock normal the shock starts to approach the particle to overtake it quickly , usually for @xmath25 . while upstream of the shock the particle distance from the shock is on average not larger than @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the particle gyroradius and the particle upstream residence time @xmath28 , for the magnetic field not strictly uniform and parallel to the shock normal . due to the high anisotropy of particles interacting with the shock an average energy gain per one cycle _",
    "downstream - upstream - downstream _ is comparable to the particle original energy , @xmath29 .",
    "the above energy gain is much smaller than the highest possible effect @xmath30 occurring when particle momenta , after crossing the shock , are instantaneously scattered on large angles .",
    "one should note that in order to change the upstream particle momentum back , toward the shock , until the shock overtakes it , the particle has to move the distance @xmath31 off the shock .",
    "it requires that the particle moves along the shock normal at least for a time @xmath32 , which is a factor of @xmath33 larger than the mean residence time in realistic magnetic field . for large @xmath15",
    "the probability of having such conditions , leading to the mean energy gain in the fermi process @xmath30 , is negligible ."
