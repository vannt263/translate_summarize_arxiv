    "the efficient coupling from a sub - micrometer sized waveguide to a single - mode fiber core requires a redesign of the two systems to achieve good mode matching .",

    "forces the optical mode of the waveguide to expand thereby gradually transferring the mode from gaas with high refractive index ( @xmath23 = 3.4 ) to air .",

    "this ensures that the fiber can be operated at a safe distance from the nanophotonic waveguide during experiments .",

    "the maximal mode overlap is achieved when the waveguide mode is almost entirely in air while still being guided , i.e. , the effective index of the waveguide is about 1 .",

    "that is , the width of the waveguide along the propagation direction @xmath27 has to change slowly to prevent coupling of the fundamental mode to higher - order or counter - propagating modes . because of the high @xmath25 for gaas waveguides , the effective index of the waveguide is relatively large compared to the refractive index of air allowing to change the width of the waveguide relatively fast initially .",
