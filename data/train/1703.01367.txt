    "almost exactly 100 years ago in 1917 willem de sitter published two seminal papers @xcite in which he presented his , now famous , exact solution of einstein s gravitational field equations without matter but with a positive cosmological constant  @xmath2 . together with the pioneering work from the same year by einstein himself @xcite",
    ", they mark the very origin of relativistic cosmology .",
    "since then , the vacuum de sitter universe with @xmath4 and its formal antipode with @xmath5 , later nicknamed the anti - de sitter universe , have become truly fundamental spacetimes .",
    "they admit a cornucopia of applications , ranging from purely mathematical studies , theoretical investigations in classical general relativity , quantum field theory and string theory in higher dimensions , to contemporary `` inflationary '' and `` dark matter '' cosmologies , modeling naturally the observed accelerated expansion of the universe , both in its distant past and future .",
    "this remarkable number of applications in various research branches clearly stems from the fact that the ( anti-)de  sitter spacetime is highly symmetric and simple , yet it is non - trivial by being curved everywhere . in fact , it is _ maximally symmetric _ and has a _ constant curvature _ , just as the flat minkowski space .",
    "of course , this greatly simplifies all analyses and studies .",
    "one would be inclined to expect that , after a century of thorough investigation of various aspects of these important spacetimes , there is not much left to add or discover .",
    "quite surprisingly , still there are interesting new properties which deserve some attention .",
    "to celebrate the centenary of de sitter space , we take the liberty of presenting here yet another family of coordinate representations of de sitter and anti - de sitter 4-dimensional solutions , in which the metric is _ diagonal _ and typically _ static and axially symmetric_. it naturally arises in the context of @xmath6-metrics @xcite with a cosmological constant  @xmath2 , which belong to a wider class of plebaski  demiaski non - expanding spacetimes @xcite . as far as we know , this family has not yet been considered and systematically described .",
    "we hope that it could find useful applications in general relativity and high energy physics theories .    in particular , in our work we will present and analyze the family of metrics for de sitter and anti  de sitter spacetimes which can be written in a unified form @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are two independent discrete parameters .",
    "the metric has the geometry of a _ warped product _ of two",
    "_ 2-spaces of constant curvature _ , namely @xmath11 ( according to the sign of @xmath12 ) spanned by @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ( according to the sign of @xmath2 ) spanned by @xmath15 .",
    "the warp factor is @xmath16 . also , there are two obvious symmetries corresponding to the killing vectors @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the metric is clearly static when @xmath19 .",
    "it is also axially symmetric when the axis given by @xmath20 is admitted ( for @xmath21 and for @xmath22 ) , in which case this axis is regular for @xmath23 .",
    "the metric ( [ eq : pddads])([eq : p ] ) is a special subcase of the plebaski ",
    "demiaski non - expanding ( and thus kundt ) type  d solutions , see metric ( 16.27 ) of @xcite .",
    "it is obtained by setting @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( so that @xmath26 ) with the identification @xmath27 this gives vacuum @xmath6-metrics , as classified by ehlers and kundt @xcite , generalized here to any value of the cosmological constant @xmath2 . when @xmath28 , the curvature singularity at @xmath29 disappears and the metric reduces to the conformally flat ( anti-)de  sitter space with ( [ eq : p ] )",
    ". therefore , the family of de sitter and anti  de sitter metrics ( [ eq : pddads])([eq : p ] ) can be viewed as a _ natural background for the b - metrics with @xmath2 _ , and will thus play a key role in understanding their geometrical and physical properties .",
    "this is our main motivation .",
    "the structure of the present work is simple . in the next section  [ sec2 ] we recall basic properties of ( anti-)de sitter spacetimes , introducing the notation . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we identify all distinct subclasses of the general metric ( [ eq : pddads])([eq : p ] ) .",
    "these are studied in detail in subsequent section  [ sc : ds ] for the de sitter case @xmath4 , and for the anti  de sitter case @xmath5 in section  [ sc : ads ] .",
    "there are also four appendices in which we present a unified form of the new parametrizations , their mutual relations , further metric forms , and transformations to standard ( anti-)de  sitter metrics .",
    "minkowski , de  sitter and anti - de  sitter spacetimes are the most fundamental and simplest exact solutions of einstein s field equations",
    ". they are maximally symmetric , have constant curvature , and are the only vacuum solutions with a vanishing weyl tensor  they are conformally flat and satisfy the field equations @xmath30 , where  @xmath2 is a cosmological constant , so that in four spacetime dimensions the curvature is @xmath31 .",
    "minkowski , de  sitter and anti - de  sitter spacetimes are thus einstein spaces with vanishing , positive , and negative cosmological constant  @xmath2 , respectively",
    ".    specific properties of these classic spacetimes have been investigated and employed in various contexts for a century .",
    "they were described in many reviews , such as by schrdinger @xcite , penrose @xcite , weinberg @xcite , mller @xcite , hawking and ellis @xcite , birell and davies @xcite , bik @xcite , bik and krtou @xcite , grn and hervik @xcite , or griffiths and podolsk @xcite .",
    "let us recall here only those expressions and properties that will be important for our analysis .      since the original works by de  sitter @xcite and lanczos @xcite it is known that the de  sitter manifold can be conveniently visualized as the hyperboloid @xmath32 embedded in a flat five - dimensional minkowski space @xmath33 this geometrical representation of de  sitter spacetime is related to its symmetry structure characterised by the ten - parameter group so(1,4 ) .",
    "the entire hyperboloid ( [ c1 ] ) is covered by coordinates @xmath34 , @xmath35}$ ] , @xmath36}$ ] , @xmath37 such that @xmath38 in which the de sitter metric takes the flrw form @xmath39 the spatial sections at a fixed synchronous time  @xmath40 are 3-spheres @xmath41 of constant positive curvature which have radius @xmath42 .",
    "these contract to a minimum size @xmath43 at @xmath44 , and then re - expand .",
    "the de  sitter spacetime thus has a natural topology @xmath45 .",
    "this most natural parametrisation of the hyperboloid is illustrated in the left part of figure  [ fig : dshyp1 ] .",
    "_ global causal structure _ of the de  sitter spacetime can be analyzed by introducing a conformal time @xmath46 and the conformal factor @xmath47 by @xmath48 the metric ( [ c4 ] ) then becomes @xmath49 corresponding to the parametrization @xmath50 the de sitter spacetime is thus conformal to a part of the einstein static universe .",
    "its boundary given by @xmath51 is located at @xmath52 and @xmath53 , which correspond to past and future conformal infinities @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively , as illustrated in the right part of figure  [ fig : dshyp1 ] .",
    "these infinities have a _",
    "spacelike character_. for more details see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "analogously , the anti - de  sitter manifold can be viewed as the hyperboloid @xmath56 embedded in a flat five - dimensional space @xmath57 which has two temporal dimensions @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "this representation of anti - de  sitter space reflects its symmetry structure characterised by the ten - parameter group of isometries so(2,3 ) .",
    "the most natural static coordinates @xmath60 covering the entire hyperboloid are with respect to the parametrization ( 5.3 ) employed in @xcite . ]",
    "@xmath61 see the left part of figure  [ fig : adshyp1 ] , in which the anti - de sitter metric reads @xmath62 any spatial section @xmath63  const .",
    "is a 3-space of constant negative curvature spanned by @xmath64 , @xmath36}$ ] , @xmath37 .",
    "the singularities at @xmath65 and @xmath66 are only coordinate singularities .    .",
    "the surface drawn is that for @xmath67 ( that is @xmath66 ) . with @xmath68 and @xmath69 reintroduced , each point represents a 2d hemisphere .",
    "right : the global conformal structure of anti - de  sitter spacetime ( with @xmath70 ) .",
    "it is conformal to the region @xmath71 of the einstein static universe represented here ( by dashed lines ) as a solid cylinder of radius  @xmath72 and infinite length .",
    "the boundary @xmath73 is the anti - de  sitter conformal infinity  @xmath74 , which has a timelike character and topology @xmath75 .",
    "the penrose diagram , corresponding to 2d shaded section , is obtained by fixing the coordinate  @xmath69 . ]    the two temporal dimensions @xmath58 and @xmath59 in the 5d flat space are parametrised using ( [ d3 ] ) by a _ single _",
    "time coordinate @xmath76 that is _ periodic _ : values of @xmath76 which differ by a multiple of @xmath77 represent the same points on the hyperboloid .",
    "thus , the anti - de sitter spacetime defined in this way has the topology @xmath78 , and contains closed timelike worldlines .",
    "this periodicity of @xmath76 is not evident in the four - dimensional metric ( [ d4 ] ) , and it is possible to take @xmath79 .",
    "such a range of coordinates corresponds to an infinite number of turns around the hyperboloid .",
    "it is usual to unwrap the circle @xmath80 and extend it to the whole @xmath81 instead , without reference to the parametrisation ( [ d3 ] ) .",
    "one thus obtains a _ universal covering space _ of the anti - de  sitter universe with topology @xmath82 without closed timelike curves .",
    "to represent _ global causal structure _ of the anti - de  sitter spacetime , a conformal spatial coordinate  @xmath83 and the conformal factor @xmath47 may be introduced as @xmath84 writing @xmath85 , the metric ( [ d4 ] ) then takes the form @xmath86 corresponding to the parametrization @xmath87 the whole ( universal ) anti - de sitter spacetime is thus conformal to the region @xmath71 of the einstein static universe , see the right part of figure  [ fig : adshyp1 ] . the anti - de  sitter conformal infinity @xmath88 , given by @xmath51 ,",
    "is located at the boundary @xmath73 ( corresponding to @xmath89 ) .",
    "in contrast to the de  sitter space , the conformal infinity  @xmath88 in the anti - de  sitter spacetime forms a _ timelike surface _ @xmath73 .",
    "first , we are going to summarize different possible forms of the metric ( [ eq : pddads ] ) with ( [ eq : q ] ) , ( [ eq : p ] ) for the ( anti-)de sitter space , depending on the cosmological constant @xmath4 or @xmath5 , and the two discrete parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 .    to keep the correct signature of the metric , the metric function @xmath94 _ must be positive _ , @xmath95 ( otherwise there would be two additional temporal coordinates @xmath96 and @xmath97 ) .",
    "this puts a constraint on the parameter @xmath90 and the range of @xmath96 . on the other hand ,",

    "the boundary @xmath101 localizes the _ killing horizon _ related to the killing vector field @xmath102 . in the case of de  sitter universe , this coincides with the _ cosmological horizon _ separating the static and dynamic regions .",
    "the coordinate singularity at @xmath103 , where the norm of the killing vector field @xmath18 vanishes , localizes the _ axis of symmetry_. this occurs either when @xmath21 or @xmath22 . in both these cases such an axis",
