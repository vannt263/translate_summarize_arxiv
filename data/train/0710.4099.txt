    ", bohm defines the equation of motion for the particles as , @xmath3 where the quantum potential is @xmath4 . in order that an ensemble of particle trajectories satisfy the predictions of standard quantum mechanics ,",
    "the particle velocities are further constrained to obey the so called _ guidance law _ , @xmath5    the guidance law guarantees the equivalence of the particle ensemble density @xmath6 and the quantum probability density @xmath7 , since both densities evolve according to a continuity equation . from schrdinger",
    "s equation the quantum probability density has , @xmath8 and as a result of particle conservation , @xmath9    therefore , if @xmath10 then by the expressions above the two densities will remain identical . however , the definition of the guidance law [ and in turn the equation of motion , eq .",
    "( 1 ) ] is not unique , since one can add a divergence - less gauge to the definition of the particle guidance law eq .",
    "( [ guidancelaw ] ) , and the equivalence of the particle density @xmath6 and the probability density @xmath11 is maintained as before .",
    "hence , bohm s formulation of quantum mechanics is under - determined @xcite .",
    "there has been some efforts to resolve this problem @xcite .",
    "either the proposal does nt work , or if it does , it must add additional physical assumptions to bohm s theory . in brandt",
    "@xcite , however , they give a non - physical reason for choosing bohm s definition of the velocity field in one - dimension .",
    "they introduce the concept of _ quantile motion_. a particle trajectory @xmath12 is generated such that , @xmath13 this is recognized also as the cumulative probability function ( cpf ) for the probability density @xmath14 .",
    "additionally , one can think of this expression as representing the total left probability during the particle s trajectory .",
    "note , since the total probability is conserved in time , one could have used the total right probability instead .",
    "their argument for the equivalence of the quantile trajectories and bohm s trajectories rests upon the similarity between the two expressions for the velocity fields , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the particle current , and @xmath17 is the quantum probability current .",
    "they assume that the two currents are equal , hence , the quantile trajectories and bohm s trajectories will be identical ( if the initial conditions are the same ) .",
    "the two currents , however , can be related by a divergence - less gauge as shown above .",
    "therefore , they fail to show that the quantile trajectories are in fact the bohm trajectories because of the gauge freedom in the definition of the two currents .    below we present a proof that sidesteps this under - determinedness of the currents by not introducing the current concept in the first place .",
    "working directly from the quantile motion idea and schrdinger s wave equation , we show that indeed the unique quantile trajectories for quantum mechanics are the bohm trajectories .",
    "this gives a non - physical reason for selecting bohm s definition of the velocity field ( in one - dimension , at least ) , namely , the conservation of the total left ( or right ) probability .",
    "later , we show that the one - dimensional total left ( or right ) probability conservation can be used to generate bohm trajectories for higher dimensional problems if the wave function is separable .",
    "finally , we provide several comparisons of the quantile and bohmian trajectories : harmonic oscillator , free particle , the two - slit experiment , and a two - dimensional infinite square well for a separable wave function . in all cases ,",
    "the quantile trajectories are identical to the bohm trajectories .",
    "in brandt et al .",
    "@xcite , they show that one can construct trajectories by requiring that the total left ( or right ) probability is conserved along a particular trajectory . in their paper , they work with the total right probability , @xmath18 but for the following we use the total left probability ( noting that @xmath19 for all time ) , @xmath20 this is also known as the cumulative probability function ( cpf ) for the probability density @xmath14 .",
    "the cpf is one - to - one and monotonically increasing . at each time",
    ", there is only one @xmath21 that satisfies eq .",
    "( [ totalleft ] ) for a constant value of @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , there is a _",
    "unique _ trajectory such that the total left probability is conserved . given that @xmath22 is constant , @xmath23 where we assumed that the density is zero at the lower boundary .",
    "at once this can be solved for the velocity field that yields unique trajectories that conserve total left probability , @xmath24    so far the discussion has been quite general and eq .",
    "( [ xdot ] ) is a definition for trajectories for any given density @xmath14 , _ whether it be quantum or not_. to apply these quantile trajectories to quantum mechanics , we begin with schrdinger s wave equation in one - dimension , @xmath25 and the similar expression for the complex conjugate wave equation . writing the complex wave functions in polar form , @xmath26 for real @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and following the typical derivation of the quantum continuity equation , we get that , @xmath29 notice , that we did not write the right hand side of this continuity equation as @xmath30 where @xmath31this would have introduced the under - determinedness of the probability current since there is no unique anti - derivative . inserting eq .",
    "( [ nocurrent ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ xdot ] ) , @xmath32 and integrating by parts the second term of the integrand ( again assuming that the density is zero at the lower boundary ) , @xmath33 which is the one - dimensional bohm velocity field of eq .",
    "( [ guidancelaw ] ) .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the unique one - dimensional quantile trajectories are in fact the bohm trajectories in quantum mechanics .",
    "the extension of the quantile motion into higher dimensions is also discussed in brandt et al .",
    "@xcite . they show that instead of the total left ( or right ) probability being conserved in one - dimension , that in higher dimensions the probability is conserved inside a volume that is enclosed by a surface of bohmian trajectories .",
    "this property , however , is not unique to bohmian mechanics .",
    "any velocity field @xmath34 will conserve the probability inside the volume in configuration space since @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the probability density and @xmath37 is the jacobian such that the volume changes as @xmath38 .",
    "the probability inside this evolving volume is , @xmath39 which implies that @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , any velocity field @xmath34 will conserve the total probability inside a volume that in enclosed by a surface of trajectories solved from @xmath34 .",
    "this is in contrast to what was found in the one - dimensional case in ",
    "[ main ] , where there was a unique velocity field that satisfied the total left ( or right ) probability conservation .",
    "however , the quantile motion concept can be used to generate trajectories in higher dimensions if one uses the marginal distribution for each coordinate analogously to the cumulative probability distribution ( cpf ) in one - dimension .",
    "suppose the system can be described by @xmath41 cartesian coordinates , then the corresponding definition of eq .",
    "( [ totalleft ] ) is , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the marginal distribution for the @xmath44-th coordinate .",
    "again , we assume that the particles are conserved so , @xmath45 partially , integrating this continuity equation we have that , @xmath46 interchanging the partial derivative with respect to time and performing the @xmath47 integrations , and assuming that the density is zero at @xmath47 , only the @xmath48 integrals on the second term survive , @xmath49 then with the expression above , and differentiating eq .",
    "( [ newtotalleft ] ) with respect to time , @xmath50 hence , the @xmath44-th coordinate , in general , does nt conserve total left probability of the marginal distribution since @xmath51 could depend on the other coordinates .",
    "suppose , however , that @xmath52 ( i.e. the motion along the @xmath44-th coordinate is independent ) , then @xmath53 , and the total left probability is conserved for the marginal distribution @xmath54 .    in higher dimensional bohmian problems the guidance law [ eq .  ( [ guidancelaw ] ) ] for the @xmath44-th coordinate becomes , @xmath55",
    "if the wave function is separable , then , @xmath56 the probability density is also separable , @xmath57 , and the phase becomes @xmath58 . which implies that @xmath59 , or that the velocity field for the @xmath44-th coordinate is independent of the other coordinates , for all @xmath60 .",
    "hence , one can use the one - dimensional total left ( or right ) probability conservation described in ",
    "[ main ] , independently for each coordinate , to generate higher - dimensional bohmian trajectories for a separable wave function .",
    "below are several examples that compare the quantile trajectories to the bohm trajectories .",
