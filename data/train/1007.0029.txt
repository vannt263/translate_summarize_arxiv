    "most of the discovered exoplanets are found around main sequence stars , perhaps because the determination of stellar parameters is much easier than , for instance for giant or active stars .",
    "the formation theory of planets hosted by such stars is still developed and not understood well .",
    "recently , there are only known about of 10 exoplanets orbiting stars with masses greater than 2  @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , extrasolar planets encyclopaedia , http://exoplanet.eu ) .",
    "some recent rv surveys focus on detecting planets around the red giants , which are evolved main sequence stars .",
    "unfortunately , the giants and sub - giants are difficult targets for the rv technique . usually , they are chromospherically active , pulsating , surface - polluted by large spots , and rotating slowly .",
    "the giants produce small number of sharp spectral lines and their chromospheric activity and spots may change the profiles of spectral lines .",
    "this intrinsic rv variability ( also known as stellar  jitter  ) is significantly larger than instrumental errors , and may be @xmath2  m / s and larger .",
    "actually , the stellar activity may even mimic planetary signals ( see , e.g. @xcite ) . hence , when interpreting the rv variability , we may expect that different uncertainties and errors ( usually , of unknown origin ) may significantly shift the best fits from the `` true '' solutions in the parameters space .",
    "in such a case , possibly global exploration of the parameter space and the _ dynamical stability _ of multiple systems as an additional , _ implicit _ observable may help us to correct and verify the derived best - fit solutions for these factors , and to conclude on the architecture of interacting systems , even when limited data are available @xcite .",
    "we recall the _ kinematic _ rv model for the @xmath3-planet system , as the first order approximation of the @xmath3-body model : @xmath4+v_{0 } , \\label{eq : k}\\ ] ] where , for each planet in the system , @xmath5 is the semi - amplitude of the signal , @xmath6 is the orbital eccentricity , @xmath7 is the argument of pericenter , @xmath8 is the true anomaly , which depends on the orbital period @xmath9 , the time of periastron passage @xmath10 and eccentricity , and @xmath11 is a constant instrumental offset .",
    "the @xmath3-planet system is then characterized by @xmath12 free parameters , to be determined from observations .",
    "let us note , that the inclinations and longitudes of nodes are not explicitly present in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) and can not be determined directly from the rv data alone , at least in terms of the kinematic model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) .    to fit model eq .",
    "( [ eq : k ] ) to the rv data , the gaussian least - squares method is commonly used . to estimate the best - fit model parameters , we seek for the minimum of the reduced @xmath13 function , @xmath14 , which is computed on the basis of synthetic signal @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are moments of observations @xmath17 with uncertainties @xmath18 ( @xmath19 is the number of data ) , and @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are for the model parameters of the @xmath3-planet system .",
    "clearly , even in the kinematic formulation , @xmath22 is a non - linear function .",
    "it is well known that it may exhibit numerous local extrema .",
    "hence , the exploration of multi - dimensional parameter space @xmath23 requires efficient , possibly global numerical optimization . in the past",
    ", we found that good results in this problem may be achieved by an application of the genetic algorithms ( gas ) @xcite , which mimic the biological evolution .",
    "gas search for the best fit solutions ( best adapted population members ) to the model ( to the environment ) through `` breading '' an initial population ( parameters set ) , under particular genetic operators ( e.g. , cross - over , mutation ) , and through a selection of gradually better adapted members .",
    "although the gas start with purely random initial `` population '' , the search converges to the best fit solutions @xcite by _ deterministic _ way . of course",
    ", the best fit solutions may be not unique .",
    "this is very common in the case of modeling rv data .",
    "overall , the gas are robust and quasi - global optimization technique , although they not provide efficiency and accuracy of fast local methods , like the levenberg - marquardt algorithm .",
    "the gas are used in our hybrid kfit code , developed for a few years now @xcite , which also makes use of the local , and accurate simplex algorithm @xcite .",
    "it helps to quickly refine the final population of the best fits , `` grown '' by the gas .",
    "in a recent work , niedzielski  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite detected a planet hosted by evolved dwarf hd  240210 .",
    "they found an excess in the rms of keplerian 1-planet model , and interpret this as possible signal of an additional planet .",
    "we reproduced their 1-planet solution , see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( _ the top - left panel _ ) .",
    "the rms has significant scatter of @xmath24  m / s , compared to the mean instrumental accuracy of @xmath25  m / s .",
    "this rms excess is difficult to explain by the internal variability of the star , hence we tried to find a better 2-planet model . at first , we reproduced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , _ the top - right panel _ ) a tentative 2-planet solution illustrated in the discovery paper . however , we notice that the orbital periods are very similar @xmath26 and @xmath27  days , respectively , indicating strong 4:3  mmr or 1:1  mmr . in such a case ,",
    "the kinematic model is not proper anymore , due to significant mutual planetary interactions .",
    "moreover , such configurations could be hardly explained by the planetary formation theory .",
    "still , having in mind that this solution is not unique , we performed an extensive search for the local minima of @xmath28 with the kfit code .",
    "the statistics of gathered fits is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , through their projection onto orbital periods plane . in the range of orbital periods",
    "@xmath29 $ ]  days , we found _ three _ , equally good best - fit models , which correspond to different orbital configurations , and may be resolved at the @xmath30 confidence level . in the parameter maps ,",
    "the mentioned 2-planet model is labeled as fit  i. two additional fits with orbital periods ratio close to 3:2 and 2:1 are labeled as fit  ii and fit  iii , respectively ( see table  1 ) .",
    "their synthetic rv curves , with the rv of 1-planet model ( thin curve ) and observations overplotted , are shown in subsequent panels of fig .",
    "note , that the alternative 2-planet fits reduce the rms significantly , to @xmath31  m / s ( i.e. , by 1/3 ) , consistent with a conclusion in @xcite .    as may be seen in table  1 , fits  ii and iii have large eccentricities .",
    "a question remains , whether inferred orbital configurations are dynamically stable . in fact , all these fits  i  iii , transformed to osculating elements at the epoch of the first observation , lead to self - disruption of 2-planet systems .",
    "nevertheless , remembering that stable solutions may still be found in their neighborhood , we did dynamical analysis with the @xmath3-body , self - consistent gamp code @xcite ( which also relies on the gas ) , trying to refine fits  i  iii with the requirement of the long - term stability ( the edge - on , coplanar models are tested ) .",
    "certainly , at most _ one _ of these models might correspond to the real system .",
    "we did not found any stable orbits in the vicinity of fit  i. in a tiny neighborhood of fit  ii , there is a stable configuration with @xmath32 and an rms @xmath33  m / s which , as the direct numerical integrations show , is stable over 1  gyr .",
    "the best result is found for fit  iii as a stable solution , corresponding to the 2:1  mmr with @xmath34 and an rms of @xmath31  m / s , i.e. , the same as in the kinematic fit  iii .",
    "the dynamical map @xcite around this solution ( fig",
    ".  [ fig3 ] , _ the right - hand panel _ ) reveals extended island of stability ( @xmath35  au ) .",
    "this fit has moderate semi - amplitude librations ( @xmath36 ) of the critical angles @xmath37 ( around @xmath38 ) , @xmath39 ( around @xmath40 ) , and @xmath41 ( around @xmath40 ) .",
    "the numerical integrations confirmed that its stability is preserved at least over 1  gyr .",
    "the 2:1  mmr fit  iii seems the most promising planetary model explaining the rv variability of the hd  240210 .",
    "the 2:1  mmr is quite frequent in the sample of @xmath42 known extrasolar systems with jovian planets , because 56 configurations were reported ( see , http://exoplanet.eu ) .",
    "hence , this new system , which could be the first one around evolved star , is likely .",
    "we stress that solution  iii is found in relatively extended stability zone , unlike fit  ii , which lies in a tiny , isolated area ( @xmath43  au , fig.[fig3 ] , _ the left - hand panel _ ) .",
    "these two maps almost overlap in the @xmath44-range , hence other , relatively extended stable islands are rather excluded in this region .",
