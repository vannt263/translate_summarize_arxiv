    "the dependence on @xmath26 is estimated by choosing the transverse mass of the heavy quark as our central choice of scale defined by @xmath28 and vary it appropriate to the fragmentation scale of the particle state to be considered .",
    "this choice of scale , which is of the order of @xmath29 ( parton ) , avoids the large logarithms in the process of the form @xmath30 or @xmath31 .",
    "however , we have to sum up the logarithms of order of @xmath32 in the fragmentation functions . but this can be implemented by evolving them by the altarelli - parisi equation [ 10 ] .",

    "in this work we have employed a light - cone wave function to introduce the fermi motion in @xmath0 production in direct fragmentation channel and obtained its fragmentation function in leading order perturbative regime .",
    "the behavior of @xmath0 fragmentation function with such a wave function is illustrated in fig .",
    "we have studied the production rates at which the @xmath0 state is produced with and without the effect of fermi motion .",
    "first we present the @xmath29 distribution of @xmath45 for the cases of the fermi motion off and on along with the cdf data at run i in the fig .",
    "the branching ratio br(@xmath46)=0.0597 is taken from [ 11 ] .",
    "the poor agreement with data is due to the fact that here we have only considered the contribution of @xmath47 .",
    "similar behavior at tevatron run ii energies is shown in fig .",
    "we have also extended our study to the cases of the rhic and the cern lhc @xmath48 colliders .",
    "here we provide the @xmath29 distributions of the differential cross sections for @xmath49 and compare the two cases of the fermi motion off and on in the fig .",
    "4 . in all cases",
    "we have used @xmath42 gev for the confinement parameter in the fragmentation functions .",
    "naturally , the results for @xmath15 in the range of 0 - 0.6 gev fall between the above results .    calculation of the total integrated cross sections for each case shows that the total cross sections for with and without fermi motion essentially remain unchanged within the uncertainties of mote carlo simulations .",
    "the reason is first due to the momentum sum rule which the fragmentation functions should satisfy . in other words",
    "although the modification of fragmentation functions by the fermi motion redistributes the final states , the integrated cross sections are left unchanged . alternatively",
    "although the fermi motion increases the fragmentation probability for the state , i.e. , introduces a state with overall higher mass , the cross section is lowered by just the same amount when we introduce the effect in calculation of the total integrated cross section .",
    "it is evident from the figures 2,3 and 4 that the effect increases with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "the kinematical cuts play important role apart from @xmath51 .",
    "the large cross section at the rhic compared with the lhc in the fig .",
    "4 is an example .",
    "there are two main sources of uncertainities.the first is about the simulation of @xmath0 production at hadron colliders such as the uncertainties along with the fragmentation functions and parton distribution functions .",
    "these kind of uncertainties are well discussed in the literature .",
    "the second source of uncertainty is due to the choice of the confinement parameter in the fragmentation function .",
    "relying on our discussion in section 2 , our choice of @xmath42 gev seems to be justified .",
    "future determination of this parameter will shed more light on this situation .",
    "it is worth mentioning that our choice of charm quark mass , i.e. , 1.25 gev , have put our results in their upper side and that the change of the charm quark mass in its acceptable range does not have significant impact on the fermi motion effect in @xmath52 production .",
