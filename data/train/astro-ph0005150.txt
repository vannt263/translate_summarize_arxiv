    "as a class narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) are defined in terms of their optical emission - line properties @xcite . in recent years , however , nls1s have been studied mainly in relation to their x - ray emission , which displays some peculiar properties . in particular",
    ", the soft x - ray emission from nls1s seems to be extreme in its shape and variability , possibly due to an extreme accretion rate @xcite . to study",
    "this emission directly is difficult due to galactic absorption .",
    "however , an indirect probe is provided by the high - ionization coronal lines .",
    "these forbidden lines arise from species with high ionization potentials ( @xmath0 ev ) , and are thought due to photoionization by the hard agn continuum .    as part of a programme to study their multi - wavelength properties",
    ", we obtained optical spectra of 19 nls1s with the _ ids _ mounted on the _ int _ at la palma .",
    "these objects were not chosen to have strong coronal line emission , but rather to represent the range in observed x - ray spectral indices as observed using the _",
    "rosat pspc_. the optical data were reduced using starlink software .",
    "for each nls1 , we measured the strength and redshift of the strongest optical coronal lines , including [ fe vii ] @xmath1 , [ fe x ] @xmath2 and [ fe xi ] @xmath3 .",
    "the hydrogen and helium permitted lines along with several lines emitted from the nlr , including [ o iii ] @xmath4 , were also quantified .    in a previous study of agn known to have coronal lines @xcite , it was found that the objects with the largest equivalent widths of coronal - line emission were those with the steepest soft x - ray spectra , based on power - law fits to the _ rosat pspc _ data . in figure",
    "[ fig : feten ] we show the equivalent width of [ fe x ] @xmath5 versus the photon index , @xmath6 ( taken from the literature ) .",
    "no correlation is seen and a wide range in coronal - line strength is observed for a given power - law index .",
    "the exact location of the coronal line region is unknown , but it is believed to lie between the blr and nlr , possibly associated with the dusty torus invoked in agn unification models @xcite . as resolving the coronal - line region _ via _ direct imaging is difficult , to place some constraints we measured the fwhm and redshift of the coronal lines relative to the strong nlr line , [ o iii ] @xmath7 . assuming the line widths are governed primarily by orbital motion , we define a ` radial estimator ' , @xmath8 , such that @xmath9}}{r_{[\\mathrm{oiii } ] } } = \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{fwhm}_{[\\mathrm{oiii}]}}{\\mathrm{fwhm}_{\\mathrm{[fe}]}}\\right)^2 , \\ ] ] where @xmath10}$ ] and @xmath11}$ ] are the radial distances from the centre . in figure",
    "[ fig : outflow ] we plot the velocity of the coronal line ( relative to [ o iii ] @xmath7 ) versus the radial estimator .",
    "a clear correlation is present such that broader coronal lines have larger blueshifts .",
    "the simplest interpretation is that the coronal - line gas is part of a decelerating outflow .",
    "the broader coronal lines also tend to have larger equivalent widths .",
    "the lack of correlation between the coronal - line strengths and the _ rosat _ power - law indices is somewhat surprising given the predictions of photoionization models .",
    "it may be that the range in gas conditions or covering factors for the coronal - line regions between different nls1s is quite large",
    ". the continuum shape may also be aspect - dependent , such that the steep soft x - ray continuum is not always seen by the coronal - line emitting gas .",
    "finally , a single power law may provide a poor parameterization of the soft x - ray spectral shape .",
    "_ asca _ spectra of nls1s do suggest a complicated spectral shape in some objects @xcite .",
    "the shape of the soft x - ray continuum in nls1s will be accurately determined by forthcoming _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "the kinematical results suggest a connection between the coronal - line emitting gas and the central region of nls1s . in the context of a decelerating outflow model , the gas velocity is @xmath12 km s@xmath13 at a distance from the centre @xmath14 that of the nlr .",
    "given an nlr size @xmath15  pc , this implies that the coronal - line gas originates at @xmath16  pc from the centre .",
    "such a small size could be associated with the outer region of the blr and/or the inner edge of the proposed dusty torus ."
