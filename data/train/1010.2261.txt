    "the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on board the _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) _ has begun breaking new grounds in our exploration of the early universe . using the ultra - deep observations taken by the `` hudf09 '' program ( pi : illingworth ) ,",
    "samples of candidate galaxies at @xmath7 have been greatly enlarged ( oesch et al . 2010 ; bunker et al .",
    "2010 ; mclure et al .",
    "2010 ; yan et al . 2010a ) , and candidates have been found at @xmath6 ( bouwens et al . 2010b ; mclure et al . 2010 ; yan et al .",
    "2010a ) and possibly out to @xmath8 ( yan et al . 2010a",
    "; bouwens et al .",
    "the studies of the stellar populations of galaxies at @xmath9 are now underway ( e.g. , bouwens et al . 2010a ; labb et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ; finkelstein et al .",
    "the pencil - beam hudf09 data are augmented by the shallower but @xmath10 wider observations ( windhorst et al . 2010 ) of the wfc3 early release science program 2 ( ers2 ; pi : oconnell ) , which provide us a unique opportunity to study the bright end of the luminosity function ( lf ) at @xmath9 because of the much increased sample size of bright candidates ( wilkins et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ; bouwens et al . 2010d ; yan et al .",
    "even with the ers2 data , however , we are only barely able to probe the bright end at @xmath11 .",
    "it is important to extend our investigation to the brighter regime , as it could be where the progenitors of the high stellar - mass ( @xmath12 ) galaxies at @xmath135 would locate ( yan et al .",
    "such studies will need to survey larger areas , and preferably along different sightlines in order to reduce the bias caused by the underlying large scale structures ( a.k.a .  cosmic variance \" ; see , e.g. , robertson 2010 ) .",
    "our hubble infrared pure parallel imaging extragalactic survey , or `` hippies '' , was designed for this purpose .",
    "this program utilizes the unique  pure parallel \" observing mode of _ hst _ , which enables simultaneous observations using instruments that are not doing the primary observations . as the pointings of the primary observations",
    "are drawn from a wide variety of programs of different objectives , the associated parallel observations are in effect observing completely random fields , and hence are ideally suited for minimizing the impact of cosmic variance . in _",
    "cycle 17 , there were two pure parallel programs using wfc3 as the imaging instrument , one led by our team ( pid 11702 , pi : h. yan ) and the other led by m. trenti et al .",
    "( pid 11700 ) .",
    "our program has been extended to the coming cycle 18 ( pid 12286 ) .",
    "hippies will incorporate the data from all these programs for its science objectives , one of which being addressing the very bright - end of galaxy lf at @xmath7 and beyond . here",
    "we report our initial results based on the data taken by the end of cycle 17 . throughout this letter , we use the following cosmological parameters : @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16  km  s@xmath17  mpc@xmath17 .",
    "the quoted magnitudes are all in the ab system .",
    "in cycle 17 , pure parallels were only allowed when the prime instrument was either the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) or the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",
    "programs 11700 and 11702 only requested the high galactic latitude opportunities at @xmath18 , and only requested long - duration opportunities ( @xmath19  orbits ) so that the observations could be sufficiently deep . the observations and data from these two programs are described below .",
    "these two programs used both the infrared ( ir ) and the uv - optical ( uvis ) channels of wfc3 .",
    "the ir images were taken in the same three bands in both programs , namely , f098 m , f125w , and f160w ( hereafter @xmath1 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , respectively ) . in the uvis channel ,",
    "program 11700 used f606w ( @xmath22 ) , while program 11702 used f600lp ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "the left panel of figure 1 shows the system response curves in these passbands .",
    "our current work includes 26 wfc3 pure parallel fields acquired by the end of cycle 17 ( 2010 august ) .",
    "the total exposure time in these fields ranges from 6 to 34 ks , with the median of 10.8 ks ( @xmath24 5 orbits ) .",
    "the distribution of exposure time in the four bands roughly follows the ratio of uvis : f098m : f125w : f160w@xmath25 , but varies significantly among the fields .",
    "the ccd observations in uvis always have at least two cr - split exposures that enable the rejection of cosmic rays .",
    "most of the ir observations also have at least two exposures each band in each field .",
    "as the ir array was always non - destructively read - out multiple times during the exposure ( at least five times for these observations ) , cosmic ray rejection generally is not a problem , even with single exposures .",
    "our data reduction starts from the outputs from the _ hst _ on - the - fly reprocessing ( otfr ) pipeline , which are photometrically calibrated images in units of count rate ( i.e. , the `` * _ flt.fits '' images fetched from the _ hst _ data archive ) .",
    "the vast majority of our parallel observations are non - dithered because the primary cos or stis observations are not dithered .",
    "this makes it difficult to reject image defects using the usual outlier clipping method in the stacking process .",
    "most of the defects are flagged in the `` data quality '' ( dq ) extension of the processed image , which records the pixels that are diagnosed by the processing software to be problematic for various reasons ( e.g. , bad pixels , problems in telemetry , unstable response , etc . ) . in order to reduce their chance of contaminating our dropout sample , such image defects in the ir",
    "were filled by interpolation of nearby pixels .",
    "using the archival ers2 data , we also identified several thousands of additional outlier pixels that deviate from linear response at 5@xmath26 level , and these pixels were also fixed in the same way .",
    "the defected pixels were not treated for the uvis images in the current work , because these images are only used for the `` veto '' purpose in the dropout selection , and hence such image defects in uvis do not likely cause any contamination .",
    "the multidrizzle software ( koekemoer et al . 2002 ) was then used to correct for the geometric distortions and to stack the images in each band . for each field ,",
    "the world coordinate system ( wcs ) of the first image in @xmath1 was always chosen as the reference to align all images .",
    "the final pixel scale that we adopted is @xmath27  pixel@xmath17 .",
    "the pixel noise of the drizzle - combined images is correlated at small scale because of the subpixel sampling .",
    "we followed the procedure utilized in the goods program ( dickinson et al .",
    "2004 ) to calculate the correlation amplitudes in our mosaics , and then to derive the so - called  rms maps \" that register the absolute root - mean - square noise in each pixel .",
    "matched - aperture photometry was carried out by running the sextractor program of bertin & arnouts ( 1996 ) in dual - image mode .",
    "the @xmath28-band mosaics were used as the detection images .",
    "we adopt the sextractor mag_auto magnitudes , which were measured using the default ( kron factor , minimum radius ) of ( 2.5 , 3.5 ) . a 2-pixel",
    ", @xmath29 gaussian filter was used to convolve the @xmath28-band images for detection ; the detection threshold was set to 1.5@xmath26 , and a minimum of four connected pixels above the threshold was required .",
    "the rms maps were used to measure the noise in the pixels within the mag_auto apertures .",
    "we only include sources at s / n@xmath30 in the @xmath28-band ( within the mag_auto aperture ) for further analysis .",
    "the depth of our mosaics varies significantly because the exposure time and the background condition vary significantly among the hippies fields . for reference ,",
    "the median 5@xmath26 depths measured within a @xmath31-radius aperture are 27.36 , 27.08 , 27.16 , 27.05 , and 26.68 mag in @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath1 , @xmath28 , and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the source count at @xmath33  mag is complete in every field , and is complete at @xmath34  mag for 20 out of the 26 fields .     while program 11702 used @xmath23 .",

    "( right ) color - color diagram demonstrating the selection of @xmath1-dropouts .",
    "the black dots are the field objects .",
    "the shaded area indicates the selection area , where the two objects in our final sample are shown in solid red squares and the peculiar @xmath1-dropout that has an indication of variability is shown in open red square .",
    "the connected circles to left show the color track of a typical young galaxy at high redshifts using the model from bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ( bc03 ) ; @xmath37  gyr and age of 100  myr ) , and attenuated by the intervening h i absorption along the sightline using the formalism of madau ( 1995 ) .",
    "different colors are used to code different redshift ranges along these tracks : blue is for @xmath38 , magenta is for @xmath39 , and black is for @xmath40 .",
    "the selection area is well separated from the regions occupied by the potential sources of contaminations .",
    "the yellow stars show the colors of galactic brown dwarfs ( e.g. leggett et al .",
    "the green symbols show the colors of a typical red galaxy at @xmath413 simulated using a bc03 model ( @xmath42  myr and age of 2.0  gyr ) .",
    "the cyan symbols represent the colors of the same red galaxy but with a strong [ oiii ] emission line of restframe equivalent width of 100 .",
    "the black and the green arrows represent the reddening vectors in these passbands appropriate for @xmath36 and @xmath43 , respectively , using the reddening law of calzetti ( 2001 ) and @xmath44  mag . ]",
    "in this section , we describe the selection of candidate galaxies at @xmath2 as @xmath1-dropouts using hippies data .",
    "because @xmath1 does not overlap with @xmath28 , it is possible to adopt a large color decrement such that the selection is less prone to the confusion with the 4000 break of red galaxies at low redshifts and less affected by photometric errors . following yan et al .",
    "( 2010b ) , our main color criteria are @xmath45 mag and non - detections ( i.e. , s / n@xmath46 ) in the `` veto '' @xmath22 and/or @xmath23 images . based on our simulation using a large number of galaxy templates from the models of bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and the line - of - sight h i absorption recipe of madau ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the adopted @xmath47 color decrement is appropriate for selecting galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "as our uvis images are not very deep , and we do not have data at longer wavelength ( such as _ spitzer _ irac data ; see , e.g. yan et al .",
    "2010a , 2010b ) , we further require that a legitimate candidate should have @xmath48 mag in order to further reduce the chance of contamination from red galaxies at low redshifts .",
    "the right panel of figure 1 shows the selection of @xmath1-dropouts on the @xmath49 versus @xmath47 color - color diagram .",
    "the selected candidates were visually inspected to exclude objects that were formally reported to have s / n@xmath46 in the uvis image but still visible to eyes . in this step , we also rejected objects that were caused by artifacts and image defects that are not identified in the data reduction process ( see section 2.2 ) . a last concern about the contamination",
    "is that the interpolation of the identified defected pixels might leave some residuals that could mimic the colors of @xmath1-dropouts by chance . to deal with this problem , we created masks of the interpolated pixels ( see section 2.2 ) for the individual images , and ran multidrizzle to project them to the same reference frame of the science images .",
    "the locations of the candidates were examined on these projected masks , and we only kept the objects that do not have any defects in the central @xmath50 pixel area .",
    "-dropouts in our sample .",
    "images are @xmath51 in size .",
    "the red circles are @xmath52 in radius .",
    "north is up and east is to left . ]",
    "our selection above resulted in a total of three @xmath1-dropouts over 26 hippies fields that amount to 122.8 arcmin@xmath0 in area .",
    "the colors of these three @xmath1-dropouts are superposed in the right panel of figure 1 ( solid red squares ) .",
    "their image are shown in figures 2 and 3 , and table 1 lists their photometric information .     and @xmath23 .",
    "( bottom ) light curves of hippies ysdrop03 .",
    "the @xmath28 and @xmath32 data points are matched - aperture mag_auto magnitudes obtained using the master @xmath28 stack as the detection image , while the arrows are the 2@xmath26 upper limits measured within an @xmath53 aperture .",
    "the errors are 1@xmath26 error within the mag_auto aperture . ]",
    "one of these three objects , ysdrop03 ( see figure 3 ) , shows an indication of peculiar variability , which makes its candidacy as a high - redshift galaxy less certain .",
    "we performed photometry in each individual image , and obtained its light curves as shown in figure 3 .",
    "the variability is the most obvious in @xmath32 , where it is the brightest in the first image , declines by @xmath54  mag within 2 days , and remains nearly constant in the following @xmath55 days .",
    "similar trend is also seen in @xmath28 , albeit less significantly .",
    "however , such a variability does not seem to present in @xmath1 or the two uvis bands , where this object always remains undetected although the observations in these bands were executed both before and after the first images were taken in @xmath32 and @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , this object still remains a legitimate @xmath1-dropout after this scrutiny .",
    "if it is not at @xmath2 , the only viable explanation for its color and its variability is that it is a flaring brown dwarf star within our galaxy ( e.g. , schmidt et al .",
    "2007 ) . however , this interpretation is less favored , because this object has full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath56 in both @xmath28 and @xmath32 stacks and hence seems to be resolved .",
    "another possibility is that this object is an active galactic nucleus ( agn ; see , e.g. , cohen et al .",
    "2006 ) at @xmath2 , or a transient at a similar redshift . without further data ,",
    "it is difficult to determine its nature . in any case",
    ", it does not fit in the conventional picture of an lbg , and therefore we do not include it in our final sample .",
    "the remaining two are good candidate galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "none of them show time variability . both are resolved ( fwhm @xmath57@xmath58 ) in @xmath28 and @xmath32 bands and hence are not likely brown dwarfs . finally , they are not likely red galaxies at @xmath413 whose 4000 break could mimic lyman break , as their @xmath49 colors are much bluer than those of such interloppers .",
    "this is particularly true for ysdrop02 , which has a very blue color of @xmath59  mag .",
    "a few similar cases have already been observed in candidate galaxies at @xmath7 and beyond ( e.g. , oesch et al .",

    "the two @xmath1-dropouts in our final sample are the brightest candidate galaxies at @xmath63 discovered by wfc3 to date .",
    "even assuming that their redshifts are at the lower end of the selection window ( @xmath5 ) , we obtained their absolute magnitudes of @xmath64 and @xmath65  mag for ysdrop01 and ysdrop02 , respectively , which are at least @xmath66 brighter than any current estimates of the @xmath67 value at @xmath7 or 8 .",
    "earlier surveys over contiguous fields have resulted in a number of @xmath68-band dropouts ( candidate galaxies at @xmath7 ) of comparable brightness ( e.g. , ouchi et al . 2009 ; hickey et al . 2010 ; castellano et al . 2010 ) or even brighter ( capak et al . 2009 ) , and our current work indicates that such high luminosity galaxies could exist at @xmath2 .    using the formalism of madau et al . (",
    "1998 ) , the rest - frame uv luminosities of our candidates correspond to star formation rates ( sfrs ) of @xmath69 and @xmath70  @xmath71  yr@xmath17 . as an order - of - magnitude estimate , if they keep forming stars at the same rates to @xmath72 , they could accumulate stellar masses of 0.7@xmath73 in the next @xmath74 million years .",
    "therefore , our @xmath1-dropouts could be the progenitors of the high - mass lbgs observed at @xmath72 that have stellar masses to the order of @xmath75 ( see e.g. , yan et al .",
    "2005 ; stark et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the existing lf estimates of lbgs at @xmath7 and beyond are largely based on observations at @xmath76 .",
    "for this reason , it is interesting to see whether the number density of such very bright candidate galaxies at @xmath2 is consistent with the expectations from such lfs .",
    "this comparison is shown in figure 4 , where the result from this study is shown as the red pentagons .",
    "as the formal redshift selection window of @xmath1-dropout spans @xmath77 , we compare to the predictions from the lfs at both @xmath6 and 7 .",
    "our data point is apparently higher than the predictions from the @xmath6 lfs , including the one of bo10d that predicts the highest surface density . if we single out the brightest object ysdrop01 , the discrepancy is more obvious .",
    "the bo10d @xmath6 lf predicts a cumulative surface density of @xmath78 per arcmin@xmath79 to @xmath80  mag over @xmath77 , which is a factor of three lower than the density inferred from our ysdrop01 ( @xmath81 per arcmin@xmath82 ) . on the other hand , the lf of yan et al .",
    "( 2010b ; @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85  mpc@xmath86 ) predicts the highest bright - end surface density at @xmath7 .",
    "this lf , like others that are mostly based on the wfc3 @xmath62-dropout results , is applicable over the redshift range of @xmath87 .",
    "it predicts a cumulative surface density of @xmath88 per arcmin@xmath79 to @xmath80  mag , which seems to be able to explain the existence of ysdrop01 if it is at @xmath89 .",
    "in this letter , we present the initial results from the hippies program . to date",
    ", our analysis includes 26 widely separated _ hst _ wfc3 pure parallel fields at @xmath18 obtained in cycle-17 , which amount to 122.8  arcmin@xmath0 in total area . using these data , we search for candidate galaxies at @xmath2 as @xmath1-dropouts . one candidate that we found",
    "shows an indication of peculiar variability in @xmath28 and @xmath32 but remains undetected in the bluer bands , and its nature is unclear . excluding this object , our current sample consists of two very bright candidates at @xmath90 , which , based on their sfr estimates , could be linked to the progenitors of high - mass lbgs",

    "<S> we report the first results from the hubble infrared pure parallel imaging extragalactic survey , which utilizes the pure parallel orbits of the _ hubble space telescope _ to do deep imaging along a large number of random sightlines . to date </S>",
    "<S> , our analysis includes 26 widely separated fields observed by the wide field camera 3 , which amounts to 122.8 arcmin@xmath0 in total area . </S>",
    "<S> we have found three bright @xmath1-dropouts , which are candidate galaxies at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> one of these objects shows an indication of peculiar variability and its nature is uncertain . </S>",
    "<S> the other two objects are among the brightest candidate galaxies at these redshifts known to date ( @xmath3 ) </S>",
    "<S> . such very luminous objects could be the progenitors of the high - mass lyman break galaxis ( lbgs ) observed at lower redshifts ( up to @xmath4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> while our sample is still limited in size , it is much less subject to the uncertainty caused by  cosmic variance \" than other samples because it is derived using fields along many random sightlines . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the existence of the brightest candidate at @xmath5 is not well explained by the current luminosity function ( lf ) estimates at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> however , its inferred surface density could be explained by the prediction from the lfs at @xmath7 if it belongs to the high - redshift tail of the galaxy population at @xmath7 . </S>"
