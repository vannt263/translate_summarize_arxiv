    ", the @xmath2 resonance has been widely accepted as an ordinary @xmath10 state belonging to a @xmath11-wave nonet of tensor mesons  @xcite . however",
    ", this wisdom was challenged by the work of ref .",

    "one of them is the @xmath2 .",
    "the generalization to @xmath13 of the @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction was done following the same lines but with coupled channels @xcite and the @xmath2 appeared as a dynamically generated state of the @xmath3-@xmath3 interaction with parallel spins , corroborating the findings of ref .",
    "the reason for the large binding of the @xmath2 is a very large interaction of the @xmath3-@xmath3 in @xmath14 , much larger than for other channels , and larger than other interactions known in hadron physics .",
    "the molecular nature of @xmath2 claimed in refs .",
    "@xcite has been successfully tested in a large number of processes . in ref .  @xcite it was shown that it leads to a very good description of the decay rate for @xmath15 .",
    "it was also shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that the decay rates for two photons and one photon - one vector decays of the @xmath16 , @xmath2 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 were in good agreement with available data .",
    "a study of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 decays was also done within this picture in ref .",
    "@xcite and good results were obtained .",
    "another test conducted along these lines was the radiative decay of @xmath22 into @xmath2 , @xmath18 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 which was done in ref .",
    "@xcite and good results were obtained compared with the available experimental information .",
    "similarly , predictions for @xmath23 decay into @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and radiative decay of @xmath27 into @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 were done in refs .",

    "the nature of these states as vector meson - vector meson composite states has undergone a large number of test than any other model . yet , all the test have been done in the mesonic sector and not in the baryonic sector .",
    "the recent measurement of the photoproduction of @xmath2 in jefferson lab  @xcite offers us the first opportunity to do this new test , which we conduct here .    on the theoretical side",
    "there is a study of this reaction in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the idea is to create the @xmath2 as the final state interaction of two pions in @xmath1-wave .",
    "hence , one constructs a mechanism for two pion production and then lets the pions interact in @xmath1-wave to produce the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "our picture has some similarity with this idea in the sense that we also generate the resonance from the final state interaction of two mesons , but these two mesons are two @xmath3 instead of two pions .",
    "hence , the mechanism consists on the production of two @xmath3 , for which vector meson dominance is used , and then the two @xmath3 mesons , upon interaction , produce the @xmath2 . dealing with baryons at a relatively large energy and large momentum transfers",
    ", we have to introduce some elements of regge phenomenology and consider the @xmath6 tensor coupling , in addition to the vector coupling which stems from chiral dynamics .",
    "the results obtained are in good agreement with experiment , both for the invariant mass dependence and the @xmath7 dependence , offering new support for the picture of the @xmath2 as a @xmath3-@xmath3 molecular state .",

    "it was also discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite that extra terms linear in the momentum of the particles were small in this type of processes , justifying the success of the radiative decay , in spite of the photons not having small momenta .",
    "as we can see , the @xmath42 projector is factorized into one block corresponding to the initial vectors and another one corresponding to the final vectors .",
    "the amplitude close to a pole that represents a resonance is then written as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the pole position and @xmath45 the coupling of the resonance to the @xmath46 component in isospin @xmath47 and spin @xmath34 .",

    "<S> we have performed a calculation of the @xmath0 reaction , where the two pions have been separated in @xmath1-wave producing the @xmath2 resonance . </S>",
    "<S> we use elements of the local hidden gauge approach that provides the interaction of vector mesons in which the @xmath2 resonance appears as a @xmath3-@xmath3 molecular state in @xmath4 and spin 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the vector meson dominance , incorporated in the local hidden gauge approach converts a photon into a @xmath5 meson and the other meson connects the photon with the proton . the picture is simple and has no free parameters , since the parameters of the theory have been constrained in the previous study of the vector - vector states . in a second step </S>",
    "<S> we introduce new elements , not present in the local hidden gauge approach , adapting the @xmath3 propagator to regge phenomenology and introducing the @xmath6 tensor coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we find that both the differential cross section as well as the @xmath7 dependence of the cross section are in good agreement with the experimental results and provide support for the molecular picture of the @xmath2 in the first baryonic reaction where it has been tested . </S>"
