    "scalar fields play an important role in both theoretical physics and modern cosmology for their simple but non - trivial dynamics . in theoretical physics",
    ", they are present in the jordan - brans - dicke theory as jordan - brans - dicke scalar @xcite ; in kaluza - klein compactification theory as the radion @xcite ; in the standard model of particle physics as the higgs boson @xcite ; in the low - energy limit of the superstring theory as the dilaton @xcite , tachyon @xcite and dbi ( dirac - born - infeld ) field @xcite . in cosmology ,",
    "scalar fields are employed to model the inflaton @xcite , the quintessence @xcite ( for a recent review of _ quintessence _ , see refs . @xcite and references therein ) , the k - essence @xcite , the phantom @xcite , in order to drive the inflation of the early universe or to speed up the expansion of the late universe .",
    "we note that most of the scalar fields are hypothetical particles .",
    "but the higgs boson has uniquely been discovered by experiments .",
    "quintessence is a canonical scalar field which is assumed to be minimally coupled to gravity .",
    "compared to other scalar fields , quintessence turns out to be the simplest scenario which is free of ghosts and instability problems .",
    "the dynamics of quintessence in the presence of matters has been studied in great detail for many different potentials @xcite . however , for a general quintessence potential , the equations of motion are rather involved .",
    "to our knowledge , one have not yet find a general method to write the equations of motion in the autonomous form for _ arbitrary _ potential .",
    "thus the purpose of this article is to report that we have found a way .",
    "the dbi field describes the dynamics of d - branes evolving in a higher - dimensional warped spacetime .",
    "a novel aspect of this field is the existence of a speed limit on the field space , resulting from causality restrictions on the motion of the branes in the bulk spacetime .",
    "the speed limit is enforced by the non - canonical kinetic terms in the dbi field .",
    "this is different from the quintessence whose speed @xmath1 could be arbitrarily large . from this point of view , quintessence and dbi field",
    "are the counterpart of newtonian and special relativity mechanics , respectively .",
    "the cosmic evolution of dbi field have been studied in refs .",
    "these researches only apply to some special forms of potentials .",
    "thus , to find a general method applying to _ arbitrary _ dbi potential constitutes the second purpose of this article .",
    "we consider a @xmath2-brane with tension @xmath3 evolving in a 5-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the dynamics of the mobile d3-brane is described by the dbi action .",
    "the d3-brane is free to move on the internal compact calabi - yau manifold .",
    "the generalized dbi action can be written as follows @xcite @xmath4+s_{m}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath5 is the warped tension of the brane and @xmath6 is the action for matters localized in the d3-brane .",
    "the potential @xmath7 could arise under the condition that the brane is a non - bps one @xcite or there are multiple coincident branes @xcite .",
    "the potential @xmath8 is related to the brane s interactions with bulk fields or other branes .    in order to simplify our derivations , we define the variable @xmath9 as follows @xmath10 then above action can be written as @xmath11+s_{m}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] without the loss of physical significance , we could absorb the term @xmath12 into @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "then we find the action is simply    @xmath15+s_{m}\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we shall investigate the cosmic evolution of the dbi field in the background of spatially flat friedmann - robertson - walker universe @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cosmic scale factor .",
    "we model the matter sources present in the universe as perfect fluids .",
    "the perfect fluids can be baryonic matter , relativistic matter and dark energy .",
    "we assume there is no interaction between the generalized dbi scalar field and the matter fields , other than by gravity .",
    "then the einstein equations and the equation of motion of the scalar field are given @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively . here",
    "@xmath20 denotes the hubble parameter and dot is the derivative with respect to cosmic time , @xmath21 . @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the energy density and the equation of state for the matter sources .",
    "we have @xmath24 for the cosmological constant , dust matter , relativistic matter and stiff matter , respectively . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider the case of dust matter , @xmath25 . @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the derivative with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 which has the physical meaning of the generalized lorentz factor .",
    "it is apparent the speed of scalar @xmath0 is constrained to be smaller than the speed of light .",
    "this is remarkably different from the usual quintessence which could have arbitrary large speed in the sense of classical mechanics .    observing eqs .",
    "( [ eq : ein00 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : ein11 ] ) , we could absorb the constant @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) into @xmath32 and @xmath22 , respectively ,    @xmath33    then above equations of motion turns out to be @xmath34 given the scalar potential @xmath13 , @xmath14 and the equation of state @xmath35 , we are left with three variables , @xmath36 and the dbi field @xmath37 .",
    "then we have three variables and three independent differential equations . so the system of equations is closed .",
    "it is rather difficult to find the analytic solutions to the equations of motion ( 12 - 14 ) .",
    "hence in order to solve them numerically , we had better rewrite them in the autonomous form .",
    "to this end , we introduce the following dimensionless quantities @xmath38 we see @xmath39 are the functions of dbi field , @xmath9 .",
    "so they can be expressed as the function of @xmath40 .",
    "now we have only three variables , namely , @xmath41 and it is sufficient for us to derive the corresponding three independent differential equations .",
    "we remember that the system of equations of @xmath42 are an autonomous system if and only if @xmath39 are expressed as the functions of @xmath41 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath43 we emphasize that one could in general assume @xmath44 with @xmath45 other simple functions , for example , @xmath46 and so on",
    ". then we could obtain @xmath47 from this equation .",
    "similarly , @xmath39 could be expressed as the function of @xmath48 .    now with the aid of this assumption , we are able to write the eqs .",
    "( 12 - 14 ) in the autonomous form and deal with _ any _ scalar potential , @xmath14 in the calculations . in this article",
    ", we shall focus on the scalar potential @xmath14 with the expression of @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are all positive constants .",
    "the reason for this choice of potential is that what we want to study is a potential with multiple vacua .",
    "scalar fields with multiple vacua are very interesting because they have both theoretical origin in string landscape @xcite and theoretical study in coleman - de luccia tunnelling @xcite .",
    "we note that the case of the well - known ads throat , @xmath52 has been included in the desired one . as an example",
    ", we put @xmath53 in the following discussions .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in fig .",
    "( 7 - 9 ) , we plot the evolution of the rescaled speed , @xmath54 of the quintessence with @xmath9 .",
    "the figures show that , with the increasing of initial speed , the quintessence is frozen in the first false vacuum , the second false vacuum and the real vacuum , respectively .",
    "compared to evolution of dbi field , we see from figs.(2 - 4 ) that the dbi field has more times of oscillations than quintessence . how to understand this point ? the equations of motion tell us the friction term due to hubble expansion is @xmath55 and @xmath56 for quintessence and dbi field , respectively . then with the increasing of speed @xmath0 , the friction term of dbi field is greatly decreased .",
    "so the dbi field acquires more times of oscillations .",
    "with respect to @xmath9 .",
    "there are two local maximum ( @xmath57 ) , one real vacuum ( @xmath58 ) and two false vacuum ( @xmath59 ) for the potential .",
    "physically , the quintessence would firstly damped oscillates between these vacua and finally dwell on one of the vacuum due to the hubble friction.,width=340 ]    .",
    "[ f6 ]    ) of quintessence with @xmath9 .",
    "the point @xmath60 is a stable spiral and thus an attractor .",
    "the quintessence is finally frozen at @xmath61.,width=340 ]    .",
    "[ f7 ]    ) of quintessence with @xmath9 .",
    "the point @xmath62 is a stable spiral and thus an attractor .",
    "the quintessence is finally frozen at @xmath63.,width=340 ]    .",
    "[ f8 ]    ) of quintessence with @xmath9 .",
    "the point @xmath64 is a stable spiral and thus an attractor .",
    "the quintessence is finally frozen at @xmath65.,width=340 ]    .",
    "in general , the equations of motion for generalized dbi field and quintessence are rather complicated .",
    "so one resort to the method of phase analysis by writing the equations of motion in the autonomous form .",
    "many special form of potentials have been studied for dbi field @xcite and quintessence @xcite .",
    "however , the general method for dealing with _ arbitrary _ potentials have not yet been proposed .",
    "thus the outcome of this article is that we have found the method .",
    "different from the potentials studied in refs .",
    "@xcite , we investigate the cosmic evolution of the generalized dbi field and quintessence with the potential of multiple vacua .",
    "we find that , with the increasing of initial speed , both generalized dbi field and quintessence are successively frozen , in the first false vacuum , the second false vacuum and the real vacuum , respectively .",
    "compared to the evolution of quintessence , the generalized dbi field has more times of oscillations .",
    "the reason for this point is that , with the increasing of speed @xmath0 , the friction term of generalized dbi field is greatly decreased .",
    "thus the generalized dbi field acquires more times of oscillations .",
    "the conclusion in this paper may be trivial , but the proof and the method are not .",
    "as an example , one could study the coleman - de luccia tunnelling using this method . after making the wick rotation , @xmath66 in eqs .",
    "( 21 ) and eqs .",
    "( 38 ) , we are able to study the coleman - de luccia tunnelling numerically but exactly .",
