    "( 2 ) because of the substantial number of failed fits , even for a fixed doublet ratio , we alternatively measured the width of the  doublet as a single line , which was more often successful .",

    "we also implemented a 20% subtraction , or no subtraction at all , for visual comparison .",

    "significant difficulties in measuring properties of agn spectra can arise from blended fe  ii  emission lines in both the uv and optical ( boroson & green 1992 ; vestergaard & wilkes 2001 ) .",
    "we modeled fe  ii  emission in the optical using a template from marziani et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , generated from the spectrum of i zw 1 , an object with strong iron emission and relatively narrow `` broad '' emission lines .",

    "we incorporate a theoretical fe  ii  model of sigut & pradhan ( 2003 ) scaled to match the vestergaard & wilkes template at neighboring wavelengths . in a very few cases",
    "the fe  ii  in the wings of  was too strong for reliable subtraction , and these objects were excluded from our data sample .",
    "modeling of fe  ii  emission for each of our spectra is carried out by first convolving the optical template with the fwhm of  and the uv template with the fwhm of , based on preliminary spectrum fits without fe  ii  subtraction .",
    "subtraction of the optical fe  ii  was done by scaling and subtracting the template so as to give minimum deviation from a straight line between two 70    continuum bands straddling the @xmath67 fe  ii  band .",
    "( if necessitated by the redshift , we instead used the @xmath66 fe  ii  band . )",
    "many of our qsos had redshifts such that the short wavelength end of the ultraviolet fe  ii  blend , which extends down to @xmath69 , was inaccessible .",
    "this made it difficult to fit the entire template to the spectrum or to determine the continuum slope precisely in this spectral region .",
    "therefore , the fe  ii  template was scaled and subtracted so as to bring the flux in the region @xmath472980  3020 into agreement with the observed flux in the region @xmath473020  3100 , which is relatively devoid of fe  ii  emission .",
    "we assumed an underlying power - law continuum @xmath70 ( vanden berk et al .",
    "2001 ) to scale the flux to 3000    from 3060   .",
    "the model was subtracted from the spectra , and the continuum flux and emission line parameters were measured again .",
    "all fits were visually inspected following fe  ii  subtraction and objects with failed subtractions were eliminated .",
    "we examined the sensitivity of the uv fe  ii  subtraction to various details of our procedure .",
    "( 1 ) increasing the width of the gaussian used to broaden the template by a factor 2 resulted in a typical change in fwhm ( ) of @xmath71 or 2% , and a mean decrease of 1% .",
    "this indicates that uncertainties in the fe  ii  broad line width introduce insignificant errors .",
    "( 2 ) assuming a slope of @xmath72 ( i.e. , @xmath73 ) instead of @xmath74 to predict the flux at 2970 from flux at 3060 increases the flux at 2970 by 1.1% .",
    "this gave a mean decrease in the fitted  fwhm by 0.4% and an rms change of 0.8% .",
    "thus , uncertainties in the continuum slope in the near ultraviolet , including typical object - to - object variations , have little effect on the post - subtraction width of . ( 3 ) we repeated our fits with the fe  ii  template set to zero in the region @xmath472780  2830 , rather than interpolating theoretical values as described above .",
    "this resulted in a mean increase in  fwhm of 1.3% , and an rms change of 2.2% .",
    "although our procedure was insensitive to the details just described , the fe  ii  subtraction in about 20% of the objects appeared to be imperfect , most often under - subtracted .",
    "this could result from noise or artifacts or a mismatch of the template to the fe  ii  spectrum of the object . in order to assess the degree to",
    "which iron subtraction could affect the width of , we performed the following tests : ( 1 ) for a subsample of objects with various amounts of fe  ii , we scaled up or down the amount of fe  ii  measured as much as the data seemed to tolerate in a visual inspection .",
    "this was done in particular for a number of qsos with sufficient redshift to make the entire fe  ii  blend down to @xmath75 visible in the spectrum .",
    "for most objects , an increase or decrease by 50% in the iron subtraction was clearly wrong .",
    "however , at the level of 20% increase or decrease of the amount of fe  ii  found in the automated procedure , it became difficult to discern an under / over - subtraction from an `` ideal '' subtraction .",
    "this factor of 20% , which we adopt as the @xmath76 error for our iron subtraction , resulted in an average uncertainty of @xmath77 in  width .",
    "( 2 ) we also compared fe  ii - subtracted and -unsubtracted  fwhms to determine the effect of neglecting removal of fe  ii  altogether , and found that the effect of fe  ii - subtraction depends on  width . for objects with  fwhm @xmath78 , fe  ii - subtraction has the effect of increasing  fwhm by an average of 7% , and by as much as 20% . for objects with  fwhm @xmath79",
    "fe  ii - subtraction has the effect of decreasing  fwhm by similar factors .",
    "this result can be understood as a function of how the  line profile changes with fe  ii  subtraction .",

    "these objects were selected from among the survey qsos on the basis of redshift alone in order to include the widest possible range of luminosities .",

    "the eddington limit affects many of the qsos ( those with smaller than average ) , and the bias is significant but not so large as in models with fueling proportional to  and the same average @xmath214 .",

    "the scatter in the  relationship  is measured fairly well in the mass range of our observed qsos , and seems unlikely to be as much as twice the adopted value of 0.3 .",
    "the bias appears not to be sensitive to the exact form the the qso luminosity function , judging from the two cases considered above , nor is it sensitive to the detailed @xmath136 distribution .",
    "however , the bias is sensitive to whether qso fueling is governed by  or . in the latter case ,",
    "the bias is reduced , and we derive a larger evolution in the  relationship .      we have identified two significant biases involving the spectrum noise and luminosity selection effects . since these biases arise from two unrelated phenomena  the scatter in the   relationship and the scatter in the  relationship we may add them linearly to estimate their cumulative effect on the mean .",
    "we find that much of the overall trend in figure  [ f : del - both ] can be attributed to these selection effects .",
    "specifically , there is a rise of @xmath216 in  from our lowest three redshift bins to the highest three .",
    "our nominal results for the spectrum noise bias of @xmath161 and the luminosity - driven bias of 0.1 combine to give a total bias of 0.25 , leaving a derived evolution of @xmath2 in .",
    "the noise bias presumably is well determined .",
    "an increase in  with redshift could contribute to the measured evolution , but this would still be a form of evolution of the  relationship . if qso fueling is driven by galaxy mass , the luminosity bias is reduced , and the derived evolution becomes @xmath129 .",
