    "water masers have been regarded as one of the best indicators of star formation since soon after the first detection of 22-ghz water maser emission in the sources sgr b2 , orion and w 49 in 1969 @xcite .",
    "the 22-ghz 6@xmath1 @xmath2 5@xmath3 rotational transition of h@xmath4o is the brightest spectral line at radio wavelengths and traces shocked gas in star formation regions , outflows , as well as dense circumstellar shells around evolved stars .",
    "emission from this transition often exhibits significantly greater temporal variability than is commonly observed in other interstellar maser species such as oh and methanol @xcite .",
    "the physical conditions required to produce water maser excitation are high densities ( 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ) and temperatures of a few 100 k @xcite , both of which are seen in the inner parts of circumstellar disks around young stellar objects and in regions of shocked gas @xcite .",
    "interstellar masers from water ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , oh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and methanol ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) transitions have been detected towards hundreds of star formation regions in our galaxy , with many of these showing emission from more than one species .",
    "while there have been a number of large - scale untargeted searches for oh @xcite and methanol @xcite , previous searches for water masers in star formation regions have typically targeted ultracompact hii regions selected on the basis of _ iras _ ( infrared astronomy satellite ) colours ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or other sources believed to be high - mass young stellar objects ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . to date there have been no large untargeted surveys for water masers primarily because at a frequency of 22  ghz telescope beam sizes are approximately one - third the size of those at 6.7-ghz , the frequency of the strongest methanol maser transition , and hence require approximately an order of magnitude more pointings .",
    "here we present an untargeted search for water masers within the giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) complex associated with rcw 106 ( the g333.20.6 gmc ) .",
    "the gmc is located at a distance of 3.6 kpc @xcite and was discovered by @xcite during observations of molecular clouds associated with southern galactic hii regions in the j=10 transition of co. these observations uncovered a number of bright hii regions along a line which is almost parallel to the galactic plane including one of the brightest infrared sources in our galaxy , _",
    "iras_161834958 @xcite , which is associated with the hii region g333.60.2 .",
    "the gmc is roughly centred on @xmath8 @xmath9 333@xmath10 , @xmath11 @xmath9 ( or @xmath12=16:21 , @xmath13=50:20 ) and extends approximately 12 x 06 on the sky ( or approximately 90 pc x 30 pc at an assumed distance of 3.6 kpc @xcite ) .",
    "this region passes through the ring of molecular clouds that circle the galaxy at around 5 kpc from its centre ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and exhibits a diverse range of molecular regions , bright hii regions , glimpse ( _ spitzer _ galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ) point sources , _ iras _ and _ msx _ ( midcourse space experiment ) sources , all of which are embedded in a larger region of diffuse atomic and molecular gas .",
    "observations of the @xmath0co j=10 transition at 110 ghz by @xcite showed the velocity structure of the region to contain five primary velocity components , with the dominent feature centred on @xmath14 @xmath9 50 @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite showed that it is likely that at least five distinct molecular clouds lie along the line - of - sight ( see section  [ section : foreground_cloud ] ) .",
    "for this reason the g333.20.6 gmc is refered to as the main cloud , showing emission over the velocity range -35 @xmath15 to -65 @xmath15 .",
    "analysis of the integrated @xmath0co data using the clumpfind algorithm of @xcite identified 61 @xmath0co clumps within the main cloud .",
    "the @xmath0co emission takes the form of a string of knots with the clumps arranged along an axis aligned nw to se @xcite .",
    "this gmc has been the focus of numerous observations in recent times , including far - infrared ( fir ) observations of the dust continuum at 150 and 210 @xmath16 m which identified 23 emission peaks with dust temperatures between 20 and 40 k @xcite .",
    "the region was also observed by @xcite who used simba ( sest imaging bolometer array ) on the swedish european southern observatory submillimetre telescope ( sest ) to obtained a 1.2-mm dust continuum image of the region .",
    "@xcite identified 95 dust emission peaks ( or clumps ) , half of which have _ msx _ counterparts .",
    "observations of a multitude of molecular lines towards detected hii regions and _ iras _ sources indicate probable ongoing star formation @xcite . these observations , like those of @xcite have identified that the gmc has a linear clumpy structure .",
    "complete surveys of the gmc region have been carried out by @xcite for 6.7-ghz methanol masers and @xcite for 1665- and 1667-mhz oh masers .",
    "these surveys resulted in the detection of nine methanol and six oh masers within the region surveyed in @xmath0co by @xcite .",
    "five water masers have also been detected within this region in targeted searches made by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    here , we present the results of an untargeted survey of 22-ghz water masers made with the university of tasmania mount pleasant 26-m radio telescope .",
    "the survey covers two distinct regions within the gmc .",
    "the first ( hereafter region 1 ) is a 050 x 042 area centered on @xmath8 @xmath9 333 , @xmath11 @xmath9 05 .",
    "this region encompasses much of the high density gas and dust regions identified by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in the central section of the gmc .",
    "region 1 contains one previously detected 22-ghz water maser , g333.130.43 , discovered by @xcite .",
    "the second region ( hereafter region 2 ) covers a 028 x 024 area of the gmc and is approximately centred on well - known optically visible hii region rcw 106 .",
    "this region contains two previously detected water masers . the extent of the two regions compared to the integrated @xmath0co emission are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:13coregions ] .",
    "the gmc is the focus of an ongoing project to characterise the turbulence in the molecular cloud and compare this to the star formation efficiency in order to attain a relationship between the two . commencing in 2004 a multitude of millimetre molecular line transitions ( including @xmath0co @xcite , cs , c@xmath17s , c@xmath18o , c@xmath4h , hcn , h@xmath0cn , hco@xmath19 , h@xmath0co@xmath19 , hnc , ch@xmath20oh and sio )",
    "have been observed by the delta quadrant survey team at the university of new south wales ( unsw ) .",
    "interstellar masers require special physical conditions and the different species are generally thought to trace particular evolutionary phases of the high - mass star formation process . through combining information on all the strong and common interstellar maser transitions with millimetre molecular line and other existing infrared and millimetre continuum data we aim to better understand the evolutionary phases traced by each type of maser .",
    "the primary search for 22-ghz water masers towards the g333.20.6 gmc was undertaken between 2005 april - november using the university of tasmania s 26-m radio telescope at mount pleasant . the observations were made with a cryogenically cooled receiver that detects both left and right circularly polarized signals and has a typical system equivalent flux density of 2000 - 2200  jy in good weather at elevations above about 40  degrees . at 22  ghz the telescope has a 2.2-arcmin half power beam width ( hpbw ) and at the time of the observations the measured rms pointing errors were @xmath91 arcminute .",
    "the data were recorded using a 2-bit auto - correlation spectrometer configured with 2048 spectral channels per polarisation over a 32-mhz bandwidth , which was centred on an lsr velocity of approximately .",
    "the observations covered a velocity range of 430 @xmath15 with a spectral resolution of 0.25 @xmath15 .",
    "the two regions were surveyed using an equilateral triangle pattern with each pointing separated by 1.1 arcminutes ( half of the hpbw ) from all adjacent grid points .",
    "each pointing was observed for a total onsource integration time of 10 minutes .",
    "the water maser g333.6080.215 , discovered by @xcite , was observed at the beginning of each observing session to test the system and ensure consistency .",
    "although it is not located in either of the survey regions we have included it in the nine masers detected in this survey .",
    "the weather conditions in which the observations were made varied substantially , and in general , the data for region 1 were taken under much more favourable conditions . in order to minimize atmospheric and telescope pointing effects",
    "all observations were made above an elevation of 40 degrees .",
    "data affected by poor weather conditions were reobserved ( in some cases on multiple occasions ) , however a small percentage of the data has a significantly poorer sensitivity .",
    "the observations of region 1 required approximately 750 pointings while region 2 was much smaller containing just under 300 pointings .",
    "after box car smoothing over 5 channels and averaging the two polarisations together the majority ( 78 percent ) of the data taken in region 1 had an rms noise level of less than 1 jy while the remaining ( 22 percent of ) data in this region was subject to an rms noise level of between 1 jy and 2 jy .",
    "this equates to a 5@xmath21 detection limit of 5 jy over the majority of the region , with a maximum of 10 jy in the worst affected pointings . in region 2",
    "only 35 percent of pointings have an rms noise level of less than 1 jy and the remaining 65 percent had an rms noise of up to 5 jy .",
    "this equates to a 5@xmath21 detection limit between 5 and 25 jy , hence our ability to detect weaker masers within region 2 is greatly reduced .    for each detected water maser additional observations consisting of a 5-point grid ( centred on the preliminary position )",
    "were made to locate the emission more accurately .",
    "the position was determined by fitting a 2d circular gaussian ( with the same hpbw as the telescope ) to the relative amplitudes of the strong emission in the maser spectra observed in the 5-point grid .",
    "positions determined in this manner are accurate to approximately 1 arcminute , which is insufficient to allow meaningful comparison with millimetre and infrared observations of the region . in order to obtain accurate positions for the detected water masers",
    "we were granted two sessions of australia telescope compact array ( atca ) director s time .",
    "preliminary observations of the masers detected in the mount pleasant survey were made on 2006 june 19 with the atca in the 1.5d configuration .",
    "the observations were centred on a frequency of 22.238 ghz with the correlator configured to record 256 spectral channels across a 16-mhz bandwidth . these observations failed to detect one of the water masers discovered in the mount pleasant survey ( g333.290.38 )",
    ", most likely due to temporal variability .",
    "further observations were made with the atca in the 6a configuration on 2006 july 16 & 17 . in this array configuration",
    "the minimum baseline length is 337 m and the maximum is 5939 m. the observations were centred on 22.236 ghz and the correlator sampled two orthogonal linear polarisations , each processed to give a 512 channel spectrum across an 8-mhz bandwidth .",
    "each of the maser sites detected in the earlier atca observations ( 8 in total ) were observed in a series of three minute cuts over a range of hour - angles .",
    "observations of one of the phase calibrators mrcb1613586 or mrcb164650 were made for a duration of 90 seconds before and after every two maser observations ( i.e. every 6 minutes ) .",
    "pksb1934638 was used as the primary flux calibrator and at 22.236 ghz has an assumed flux density of 0.83  jy .",
    "pksb1253055 was used for bandpass calibration .",
    "these atca observations were made using reference pointing , and as arcsecond accurate positions were obtained in the initial atca observations all of the maser sites were close to the centre of the primary beam .",
    "over the two days each source was observed a total of eight times , equivalent to a total on - source integration time of 24 minutes .",
    "the data were processed using the miriad software package @xcite applying the standard techniques for atca spectral line and continuum observations .",
    "continuum sources which were located away from the centre of the primary beam have had their flux densities corrected to account for beam attenuation .",
    "the frequency resolution , after hanning smoothing , was 0.038 mhz or 0.50 @xmath15 .",
    "the rms noise in a single spectral channel in the final data cubes was approximately 0.15 jy and the signal - to - noise ratio of the final spectra was about 20:1 in the worst case .",
    "the rms noise level in the continuum images was typically around 0.02 jy / beam .",
    "these observations have enabled us to determine the positions of the water masers to an accuracy of approximately 0.5  arcseconds .",
    "a search of two regions near the g333.20.6 giant molecular cloud resulted in the detection of nine 22-ghz water masers , five of which are new detections ( table  [ tab : masers ] ) , as well four 22-ghz continuum sources ( see section  [ section : cont ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : sick_pic ] shows the positions of all the detected water masers overlaying the integrated @xmath0co emission observed by @xcite , while fig .",
    "[ fig:3colour ] shows the maser locations on a three colour glimpse image of the gmc .",
    "comparison of the water maser locations with the other maser species , the integrated @xmath0co emission and the three colour glimpse image shows that in general the water masers originate very close to the higher density molecular gas and warm dust , near the main axis of star formation within the molecular cloud .",
    "in contrast the methanol masers tend to be offset from this axis , close to the interface between the intense mid - infrared emission and the larger molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "spectra of the detected water masers are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : new ] and  [ fig : previous ] .",
    "the spectra have been produced by integrating the emission in the atca image cubes for each source .",
    "the only exception is water maser g333.290.38 for which the mount pleasant spectrum is shown .",
    "the positional accuracy of sources detected in the atca observations is approximately 0.5 arcseconds and we have used three significant figures after the decimal place in their galactic coordinate names . for the source only detected in the mount pleasant component of the survey",
    "we are only justified in using 2 significant figures and have done so throughout the paper .",
    "comments on each maser can be found in section  [ section : sources ] .",
    "the newly detected water masers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : new ] ) , with one exception have a peak flux density less than 50  jy , while the previously detected sources ( fig .  [ fig : previous ] ) , again with one exception , have peak flux densities greater than 100  jy .",
    "the 6.7-ghz methanol masers sites in this region have previously been searched for associated 22-ghz water maser emission by @xcite who detected emission towards a number of sources ( g332.9420.686 , g333.1210.434 , g333.1280.440 , g333.1300.560 , g333.2340.062 and g333.4660.164 ) in the g333.20.6 giant molecular cloud .",
    "three of these ( g332.9420.686 , g333.2340.062 and g333.4660.164 ) lie outside the regions of our untargeted search .",
    "while of the other three , only g333.1210.434 was detected in the current work .",
    "it appears that the emission attributed to g333.1280.440 by @xcite is in fact associated with g333.1210.434 , while that associated with g333.1300.560 was not detectable at the epoch of our search . because of the uncertainty in the position of the water masers detected by @xcite and the possibility that some may result from an unassociated strong source detected in a sidelobe , in figs .",
    "[ fig : sick_pic ] & [ fig:3colour ] we have only marked those water masers detected in our current survey .",
    "in addition to the nine water masers that we present , we made a one - time detection with the 26-m mount pleasant radio telescope of a water maser right on the edge of the field of observations with coordinates g333.220.20 .",
    "subsequent observations showed no detectable emission and as a result we do not include it in the list of water masers that we detect .",
    "this emission consisted of a single velocity feature at 87 @xmath15 of around 6 jy .",
    "we believe that this emission was actually a detection of the strong water maser g333.2340.062 detected by @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported g333.2340.062 to consists of multiple velocity features with the most prominent observed at 86 @xmath15 , with a flux density of 108 jy .",
    "the majority of the water masers we detected have exhibited variability of up to a factor of 10 on a time scale of several months .",
    "this type of variability is common in water masers and a survey of water maser emission towards main - line oh masers in star formation regions by @xcite found that about 60 percent of water masers exhibited variability of up to a factor of two over an eight month period , while the remaining 40 percent exhibited more extensive variability . given that our initial observations were made in varying weather conditions with comparitively poor pointing accuracy it is difficult to quantify the absolute variations accurately .",
    "however , because the water masers have multiple spectral components we are able to determine that variability has occurred by examining the relative amplitudes .",
    "water masers associated with low mass stars are typically both weaker and more variable than those associated with high mass stars @xcite .",
    "so we would expect our observations to be more likely to detect masers associated with high - mass star formation , than those associated with less luminous objects .",
    "variability is also a likely explanation as to why two of the masers detected in the survey with the 26-m mount pleasant radio telescope were not detected in the final observations made with the atca 6 - 8 months later , particularly if these masers are associated with low - mass stars .",
    "we have compared the positions of the water masers that we detected with glimpse , _ iras _ and _ msx _ sources , as well as 1.2-mm dust clumps @xcite , fir sources @xcite , @xmath0co emission @xcite , cs emission ( n. lo , private communication ) and other maser species .",
    "the relative positional accuracy of each of these datasets differs , some having significantly poorer positional accuracy than our atca observations .",
    "we consider a water maser to be associated with a glimpse , _ iras _ , _ msx _ or fir source if it is within a radius of 2 , 30 , 5 or 60 arcseconds respectively .",
    "for water maser g333.290.38 we use more relaxed positional constraints as its position is much less accurately known . for this source",
    "we consider the water maser to be associated if it is within 5 , 90 , 40 or 60 arcseconds of a glimpse , _ iras _ , _ msx _ or fir source respectively .",
    "we consider a water maser to be associated with a @xmath0co , cs or 1.2-mm dust continuum clump if its position falls within the radius of the @xmath0co , cs or 1.2 mm dust clumps .",
    "we have used the clump radii reported by @xcite and @xcite for the @xmath0co and 1.2-mm dust clumps , respectively . in the case of the cs data we have considered that a water maser falls within the radius of a given cs clump if it lies within emission that has a value of flux density per beam which surpasses a 5@xmath21 level .",
    "velocity ranges of the @xmath0co and cs clumps correlate well with the velocity ranges of the associated masers ( see tables  [ tab : co ] and [ tab : cs ] )",
    ". table  [ tab : ass ] summarises all associations .    of the nine water masers that we detect , four are associated with a glimpse point source , three are associated with an _ iras _ source , two are associated with an _ msx _ source , five are associated with a fir clump @xcite and seven are associated with a 1.2-mm dust clump @xcite .",
    "all of the water masers detected in this survey either lie within a @xmath0co clump identified by @xcite or an identifiable emission peak of the @xmath0co data .",
    "in addition all of the water masers , for which cs data of the gmc was available , are associated with cs emission peaks covering a comparable velocity range to the masers .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,>,>,^,^,^ , < \" , ]     the misclassification rates for the model , given a probability of 0.5 of maser presence within a given clump are again low in predicting the clumps that have no associated water maser . of the 73 1.2-mm dust clumps that fall within our survey region , seven have an associated water maser , while 66 do not .",
    "our model predicts that 65 of the 66 clumps with no associated water maser will not have an associated water maser and returns a false - positive result for the remaining clump .",
    "the model predicts that of the seven clumps that have an associated water maser only four will have an associated water maser and returns a false - negative for the remaining three clumps .",
    "as this model is only concerned with clump radius it is easy to illustrate its physical implications . by setting the probability of maser presence to be 0.5 , for example , we are able to determine that the corresponding clump radius is approximately 1.25 pc .",
    "this means that all 1.2-mm dust clumps with a radius of 1.25 pc or greater have a probability of 0.5 or more of having an associated water maser .",
    "regions within the gmc associated with rcw 106 have been surveyed for 22-ghz water masers .",
    "this resulted in the detection of nine water masers ( five of these being new detections ) and four 22-ghz continuum sources .",
    "all of the water masers that we observed have exhibited some level of variability over the 11 month course of these observations .",
    "the most extensive temporal variability was observed in water maser g333.0600.488 , which showed a variation in peak flux density of a factor of 10 over the observational period .",
    "the gmc has previously been searched for 6.7-ghz methanol masers @xcite and main - line oh masers @xcite .",
    "in addition to the nine water masers detected there are four 6.7-ghz methanol masers @xcite and three oh masers @xcite within the regions surveyed here .",
    "all of the three species of masers have sub - arcsecond positional accuracy which allows a comparison of the relative positions of the respective maser species .",
    "the water masers that we detect lie along the main axis of star formation within the gmc while the methanol masers are located near the periphery .",
    "we find there to be little overlap between the sites of the different maser species , in fact there are only two associations with other maser species .",
    "there is one association with a 6.7-ghz maser and one association with an oh maser .",
    "four of the new water maser detections are associated with glimpse point sources , of similar colours to those associated with detected 6.7-ghz methanol masers .",
    "there is a slight bias for the water maser associated sources to be less red .",
    "this coupled with the relative positions of the water masers and the 6.7-ghz methanol masers with respect to the main axis of star formation lends support to the hypothesis that 6.7-ghz methanol masers trace an earlier evolutionary phase than water masers .",
    "all of the water masers are associated with a @xmath0co emission peak that we identify or a clump reported by @xcite .",
    "statistical investigation of the @xmath0co @xcite and 1.2-mm dust @xcite clumps shows that there is a strong increase in likelihood of water maser detection with increased clump radius , mass , density and brightness . after fitting a binomial generalized linear model to the maser presence data using the clump properties of @xcite and @xcite as predictors we obtained the simplest models with the greatest maser predictive power . in the case of the 1.2-mm dust",
    "clumps our model uses only clump radius to predict the likelihood of the clump having an associated water maser .",
    "however the model generated for @xmath0co clumps takes into account radius , integrated flux density of the clump peak and mass .",
    "these models have a low misclassification rate and may allow more efficient targeted searches for water masers ( where appropriate @xmath0co or 1.2-mm data is available ) than those previously conducted towards other species of masers or mid - infrared sources . while our survey was of comparatively small scale , we believe that the results are indicative of the likelihood of occurrence of water masers with respect to @xmath0co and 1.2-mm dust clumps .    observations of @xmath0co clumps and 1.2-mm dust clumps within the g333.20.6 gmc that do not fall within the regions already surveyed will allow us to test and refine our predictive models .",
    "additional observations towards @xmath0co clumps and 1.2-mm dust clumps which are not part of the g333.20.6 gmc will allow us to determine models with more highly accurate predictive properties and lower standard errors . as more data for the g333.2 - 0.6 gmc in other molecular line transitions becomes avaliable , analysis similar to what we have undertaken here",
    "will be carried out .",
    "the multitude of data avaliable for this gmc provides a unique oppourtunity which may provide the evidence to support an evolutionary argument .",
