    "particle physics models predict the occurrence of several phase transitions in the early universe , such as e.g. , the electroweak phase transition or the quark - hadron phase transition .",
    "phase transitions in the early universe may leave observable vestiges , such as topological defects @xcite , magnetic fields @xcite , the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite , baryon inhomogeneities @xcite , gravitational waves @xcite or black holes @xcite . the effects of some of these relics can constrain the model , as in the case , e.g. , of monopoles and domain walls . late time",
    "cosmological phase transitions have also been proposed to act as seeds of the large - scale structure formation and as an explanation of the dark energy problem @xcite .",
    "the outcome of a phase transition depends , both quantitatively and qualitatively , on several aspects of the dynamics , for instance , the nucleation rate , the velocity of bubble expansion , and the temperature variation during the development of the transition .    in general ,",
    "the evolution of a first - order phase transition can be divided in three stages , namely , supercooling , reheating and phase coexistence . at @xmath0",
    "the free energy has two degenerate minima separated by a barrier .",
    "hence , the bubble nucleation rate @xmath1 vanishes . at @xmath2 ,",
    "`` critical '' bubbles nucleate",
    ". these are bubbles of the true vacuum which are large enough that their volume energy dominates over their surface tension , so they can expand . assuming that the standard picture of bubble nucleation applies , bubbles of the supercooled phase will nucleate in a homogeneous background of true vacuum",
    ". the number of bubbles will not be appreciable until a lower temperature @xmath3 , which can be estimated as follows .",
    "the age of the universe is @xmath4 , and a causal volume is @xmath5 .",
    "then , if at least one bubble is to be created in a time @xmath6 in a volume @xmath7 , we must require that @xmath8 .",
    "thus , the temperature @xmath9 is roughly determined by the condition @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , this picture may not work and the supercooling stage may be shorter ( or not occur at all ) .",
    "for instance , the presence of impurities ( such as e.g. topological or non - topological solitons ) could trigger bubble nucleation @xcite .",
    "also , if the phase transition is weakly first - order , i.e. , if the barrier of the free energy is sufficiently small , thermal fluctuations called subcritical bubbles may dominate @xcite . in this case , there may be a two - phase emulsion already at @xmath11 . then , sub - critical bubbles may percolate and true - vacuum domains may begin to grow at a temperature @xmath12",
    ".    initially , bubbles of true vacuum grow with a velocity which is governed by the pressure difference across their walls and by the viscosity of the hot plasma or relativistic gas surrounding them .",
    "as bubbles expand , latent heat is liberated and reheats the system back to a temperature @xmath13 . as a consequence ,",
    "the expansion of bubbles slows down , since the pressure difference decreases as @xmath14 approaches @xmath15 .",
    "if the latent heat @xmath16 is negligible , there will be no temperature variation .",
    "one expects that reheating will be important if @xmath16 provides the energy density difference needed to increase the temperature of radiation from @xmath3 back to @xmath17 , i.e. , when @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath16 is much larger than @xmath19 , the temperature @xmath13 will be very close to @xmath20 .",
    "when this happens , a stage of `` slow growth '' or `` phase coexistence '' follows . indeed , since @xmath14 can not increase beyond @xmath15 , bubbles will grow only at the rate at which the expansion of the universe takes away the injected energy .",
    "the temperature will thus remain nearly constant until every region of space has been converted to the stable phase .",
    "although the above picture is quite general , the details of the dynamics depend on the specific model .",
    "a complete analysis involves , even in the simplest cases , solving a set of integro - differential equations for the nucleation and expansion of bubbles , which takes into account the reheating of the thermal bath .",
    "therefore , it is useful to find general characteristics , which will permit to obtain some conclusions before embarking on the task of computing the development of a given phase transition . in ref .",
    "@xcite , an analytical approach was performed , which allowed to obtain some general conclusions on the evolution .",
    "however , due to the involved dynamics of reheating , the analytical study requires some rough approximations , particularly for the nucleation rate .",
    "a numerical investigation is thus necessary in order to have a better understanding of the dynamics of first - order phase transitions and their cosmological consequences .    in this work",
    ", we shall perform a detailed study of the general dynamics of phase transitions",
    ". we shall be interested in first - order phase transitions occurring either in the radiation dominated epoch , or in a sector composed of radiation .",
    "in particular , we shall examine thermodynamic constraints which apply to any first - order phase transition .",
    "as we shall see , this allows to discuss on the possible effects of a model without making numerical calculations .",
    "we shall also make a numerical investigation of the dynamics .",
    "for that purpose , we shall use a simple model for the free energy , which allows to consider different kinds of phase transitions , both weak and strong .",
    "the model also provides an approximation for realistic theories ( e.g. , different extensions of the standard model ) .",
    "we shall discuss the implications of our results for the cosmological outcomes of the phase transition .",
    "the article is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss some general properties of phase transition dynamics , and we study model - independent relations between thermodynamical parameters . then , in section [ themodel ] we consider a simple model , consisting of a scalar ( higgs ) field , which has yukawa couplings to different species of bosons and fermions .",
    "we write down the one - loop finite - temperature effective potential for this model , and discuss the different kinds of phase transitions the model can present . in section [ transi ]",
    "we consider the equations for the evolution of the phase transition , and we compute them numerically .",
    "we are particularly concerned with the amount and duration of supercooling , and with the extent of the phase coexistence stage .",
    "we apply the results of this investigation in section [ cosmo ] , where we analyze some of the possible cosmological outcomes of a phase transition to illustrate the effect of the dynamics .",
    "we consider the formation of baryon inhomogeneities in the electroweak phase transition , the creation of topological defects , and the generation of magnetic fields .",
    "we also discuss on different proposals of late - time phase transitions as solutions to the dark - energy problem .",
    "we show that thermodynamical constraints rule out some of these models .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section [ discus ] .",
    "some technical details of the calculation are left to the appendix .",
    "we can use thermodynamic considerations to obtain some general information on the amounts of supercooling and reheating and on the duration of the phase transition , without specifying the form of the free energy .      consider a system which undergoes a phase transition at a temperature @xmath15 .",
    "the high - temperature phase consists only of radiation and false vacuum energy , so the energy density is of the form @xmath21where @xmath22 is a constant and @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom ( d.o.f . ) . at the critical temperature @xmath20",
    "the two phases have the same free energy density , but different energy density . the discontinuity @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the energy density of the low - temperature phase , gives the latent heat @xmath27with @xmath28 the entropy density difference .",
    "this entropy is liberated as regions which are in the high-@xmath14 phase convert to the low-@xmath14 one .",
    "since entropy is conserved in the adiabatic expansion of the universe , the entropy density of the system can be written as @xmath29where @xmath30 is the scale factor , and @xmath31 is its value at the beginning of the transition , i.e. , at @xmath0 . during the phase transition ,",
    "@xmath32 is given by @xmath33where @xmath34 is the fraction of volume occupied by bubbles of low-@xmath14 phase .",
    "if there is little supercooling ( e.g. , if the phase transition is weakly first - order , or if bubble nucleation is triggered by impurities ) , the temperature @xmath9 at which bubbles form and start to grow will be very close to @xmath20 . in this case , a small @xmath16 can take the system back to @xmath20 .",
    "then , a good approximation is to consider that the phase transition develops entirely at @xmath0 , with equilibrium of phases @xcite .",
    "thus , the fraction of volume is easily obtained from eqs .",

    "though , bubble nucleation does not begin as soon as @xmath14 reaches @xmath20 .",
    "the temperature decreases until the nucleation rate becomes comparable to the expansion rate . during supercooling ,",
    "the entropy of the system is that of radiation , @xmath39 , with @xmath40so , from eq .",

    "this will only be possible , however , if @xmath54 , since the supercooling stage can not be longer than the total duration of the phase transition . during supercooling , @xmath55 ,",

    "we will perform such calculation in section [ transi ] . provided that condition ( [ condphcoex ] )",
    "is fulfilled , the value of @xmath38 will be independent of the amount of supercooling , and given by eq .",
    "( [ af ] ) .",
    "we can write equivalently @xmath62 how long will the phase transition go on , depends on how large @xmath16 is .",
    "since the entropy difference is bounded by @xmath63 , the latent heat has a maximum value @xmath64 .",
    "we see that @xmath65 in this limit .",
    "this is because @xmath66 , so all the entropy must be extracted from the system in order to complete the phase transition , and this requires an infinite amount of work .",
    "the duration @xmath67 of the phase transition is related to the expansion factor @xmath68 through the expansion rate @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , it depends on the different kinds of energy ( e.g. , matter , vacuum , radiation ) that make up the total energy density @xmath70 .",
    "if our system is uncoupled from other sectors ( as in the case of late - time phase transitions ) , then it is not straightforward to calculate @xmath67 . in the early universe , instead",

    "we remark that , as long as a temperature @xmath17 is reached after reheating , @xmath67 gives the _ total _ duration of the phase transition , i.e. , the time elapsed from the beginning of supercooling at @xmath84 until the end of phase coexistence at @xmath85 . as we have seen , the condition for the validity of eq .",
    "( [ deltat ] ) is that supercooling ends before this time . otherwise , @xmath67 will be given essentially by the duration of supercooling , since the subsequent reheating stage will be short .",

    "( [ at ] ) becomes a hyperbolic sine , which indicates that the expansion of the universe is accelerated .",
    "this happens because the energy density ( [ rhocoex ] ) includes a constant term @xmath90 , which represents an effective cosmological constant @xcite . in this case ,",

    "only in this case the parameters can be close to the thermodynamical limits @xmath369 , @xmath370 . in the absence of light particles , all the latent heat that is released during bubble expansion",

    "this could be achieved , in principle , in several ways , namely , due to a low critical temperature @xmath376 @xcite , due to a large amount of supercooling @xcite , or due to a long phase coexistence stage @xcite .",

    "it is then argued that the field is trapped at the origin as long as @xmath390 is large enough to cancel the negative mass squared .",

    "since baryon number is generated near the bubble walls , a spherical inhomogeneity with a radial profile is formed inside each expanding bubble .",
    "notice that bubble nucleation stops as soon as reheating begins .",
    "in fact , due to the exponential variation of the nucleation rate with temperature , most bubbles are formed in a small interval @xmath406 around the time @xmath407 at which the minimum temperature @xmath351 is reached @xcite .",
    "this interval is in general much shorter than the time it takes expanding bubbles to complete the phase transition .",
    "therefore , it is a good approximation to assume that all bubbles are created at @xmath408 . at a later time",
    ", their walls are moving with a velocity @xmath409 .",
    "hence , all the inhomogeneities have the same profile .    in refs .",
    "@xcite , the size and amplitude of the electroweak baryon inhomogeneities were investigated using a simple effective potential , whose parameters were adjusted so as to give the desired values of the thermodynamic parameters .",
    "this approximation allows to vary independently parameters such as , e.g. , the latent heat or the bubble - wall tension .",
    "these parameters , though , are generally related in a non - trivial way , which depends on the extension of the sm that is considered .",
    "for instance , a strongly first - order phase transition will have in general a considerable amount of supercooling , and also a large latent heat .",
    "however , the relative importance of supercooling and reheating depends significantly on the specific model , as can be seen , for instance , in fig .",
    "[ tiempos ] .",
    "the amplitude of the baryon inhomogeneities , @xmath410 , is bounded by the ratio of the highest and lowest wall velocities reached during bubble expansion , @xmath411 . if @xmath16 is freely varied , one can achieve values @xmath412 or higher @xcite .",
    "however , in a specific extension of the sm this will not be necessarily so . to examine a more realistic situation ,",
    "we have considered extensions of the sm as in the previous sections .",
    "we find that , if we add a strongly coupled boson , or a boson and a fermion with @xmath413 , the velocity variation is in general @xmath414 .",
    "we find a sizeable ratio only in the case in which the fermion dominates .",
    "the addition of strongly coupled fermions was investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to make the electroweak phase transition strongly first - order .",
    "let us consider for simplicity an extension with @xmath415 fermionic d.o.f .",
    "with mass @xmath416 , and stabilizing bosons with @xmath417 , @xmath418 , and a dispersion relation @xmath419 , with @xmath261 given by eq .",
    "( [ mub ] ) .",
    "we obtain the plot of fig .",
    "[ veloc ] . for @xmath232 in the range of the figure",
    "the value of the order parameter is @xmath420 , as required by electroweak baryogenesis .",
    "the distance scale of the inhomogeneities is given by the final size of bubbles , which depends on the distance between centers of nucleation .",
    "thus , it can be roughly estimated as @xmath421 .",
    "for the present case we obtain the dashed - dotted curve in fig .",
    "our results for the distance @xmath422 agree in order of magnitude with those of refs .",
    "however , we see that the amplitude of the inhomogeneities can be important only for small values of @xmath232 .",
    "in particular , @xmath423 is reached for values of @xmath232 for which @xmath424 .",
    "therefore , baryon inhomogeneities of significant amplitude are not likely produced in the electroweak phase transition .",
    "if a global @xmath425 symmetry is spontaneously broken at a first - order phase transition , the phase angle @xmath426 of the higgs field takes different and uncorrelated values inside each nucleated bubble .",
    "when bubbles collide , the variation of the phase from one domain to another is smoothed out . according to the _ geodesic rule _ , the shortest path between the two phases is chosen @xcite .",
    "when three bubbles meet , a vortex ( in two spatial dimensions ) or a string ( in 3d ) may be trapped between them .",
    "this mechanism can be generalized to higher symmetry groups and other kinds of topological defects .",
    "if the dynamics for the phase @xmath426 is not taken into account , the number density of defects depends only on the final bubble size .",
    "the probability of trapping a string at the meeting point of three bubbles is @xmath427 .",
    "thus , the string density ( length per unit volume ) is @xmath428 , where @xmath422 is the distance between bubble centers @xcite .",
    "[ dist ] shows the different possibilities for the length @xmath422 . for stronger phase transitions , the bubble separation is larger , since the nucleation rate is more suppressed .",
    "taking into account the dynamics of phase equilibration , the number density of defects depends also on the velocity of bubble expansion .",
    "if the latter is much less than the velocity of light , the equilibration between the phases of two bubbles may complete before a third bubble meets them , thus reducing the chances of trapping a string .",
    "consequently , reheating hinders the formation of topological defects .    in the case of a gauge theory , a spatial variation of the phase @xmath429",
    "is linked to a variation of the gauge field @xcite . as a consequence , a magnetic field",
    "is generated together with the phase difference in the collision of two bubbles .",
    "then , one can say that a vortex is formed whenever a quantum of magnetic flux is trapped in the unbroken - symmetry region between three bubbles . the phase equilibration process is thus related to flux spreading , and depends on the conductivity of the plasma .",
    "bubble collision constitutes also a mechanism for generating the cosmic magnetic fields ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this mechanism may take place at the electroweak phase transition , where unstable cosmic strings and hypermagnetic fields may be formed .",
    "the latter are subsequently converted to @xmath430 magnetic fields .    a detailed calculation of the density of defects and the magnitude of the magnetic fields is beyond the scope of this paper and we leave it for future research .",
    "although some simulations have been made ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , several simplifications are generally used , which include assuming a constant nucleation rate and a constant bubble wall velocity .",
    "as we have seen , this situation is hardly realistic .",
    "moreover , the formation of topological defects and magnetic fields depend strongly on the dynamics of the phase transition .",
    "in particular , a long phase coexistence stage with a very slow bubble expansion will affect significantly the mechanism of phase equilibration during bubble percolation .",
    "in this article we have investigated the different stages in the development of first - order phase transitions of the universe .",
    "in particular , we have studied the amounts of supercooling and reheating .",
    "if the entropy discontinuity @xmath431 is larger than the entropy decrease @xmath432 during supercooling , a phase - coexistence stage is reached .",
    "then , the total duration of the phase transition can be calculated analytically .",
    "the ratio @xmath433 depends only on the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath434 . if @xmath435 , supercooling lasts for a time which is longer than @xmath67 . in this case",
    ", there is no phase coexistence , and @xmath436 gives only a lower bound for the total duration of the phase transition .",
    "we have shown that thermodynamics constrain these parameters to the region @xmath137 , @xmath437 . these constraints should be taken into account when the dynamics of a particular phase transition is considered , since approximations for the effective potential may violate them , and thus the analysis may lead to incorrect results .    with the help of a simple model",
    ", we have analyzed numerically the role of different parameters in the dynamics of the phase transition .",
    "we have verified that phase coexistence is more likely in later phase transitions , since both a lower energy scale and a smaller number of degrees of freedom favor reheating . in addition , we have seen that changing the viscosity of the surrounding medium does not affect significantly the dynamics of supercooling and reheating , although it affects the velocity of bubble walls .",
    "the incorporation of bosons to a given model strengthens the phase transition , so the effect on the dynamics is to enlarge the latent heat and suppress the nucleation rate .",
    "as we have seen , the latter effect is in general stronger , so adding bosons favors supercooling . on the contrary , adding fermions in general weakens the phase transition and at the same time increases the number of d.o.f .",
    "we have checked that in this case phase coexistence is favored .",
    "we have studied how our general results on phase transition dynamics may affect some of the cosmological consequences .",
    "for instance , in the case of dark energy from a phase transition , we have shown that the thermodynamical bounds rule out some models . besides , we have analyzed the effect of dynamics on two important parameters , namely , the number density of bubbles and the amplitude of the velocity variation during reheating .",
    "as we have seen , these quantities are relevant for the generation of different cosmological relics , e.g. , baryon inhomogeneities , topological defects and magnetic fields . in particular",
    ", we have found that it is difficult to obtain baryon inhomogeneities of sizeable amplitude in realistic models of the electroweak phase transition .",
    "we believe that our results on the dynamics can be applied to a wide class of phase transitions of the universe , and the discussion on the cosmological consequences can be extended to several interesting possibilities , such as , e.g. , the formation of baryon inhomogeneities in the quark - hadron phase transition @xcite or the generation of gravitational waves @xcite .    this work was supported in part by universidad nacional de mar del plata , argentina ,",

    "the work by a.m. was supported by foncyt grant pict 33635 .",

    "the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ integrals ] ) can be evaluated numerically . however , a numerical computation in the effective potential increases significantly the total computation time . indeed ,",
    "notice that for each temperature , we must find the minimum @xmath312 to compute several quantities derived from @xmath438 .",
    "moreover , the calculation of the bounce action @xmath439 requires the time - demanding overshoot - undershoot technique to solve eq .",
    "( [ eqprofile ] ) for the bubble profile at each @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , it is useful to employ analytical approximations for the thermal integrals .    following the derivation of ref .",

    "for example , keeping up to @xmath448 in @xmath165 and @xmath449 in @xmath450 we obtain a precision of @xmath451 for @xmath452 .    the expansion for large @xmath205 can be obtained by changing the variable of integration to @xmath453 and expanding the logarithm in eq .",

    "hence , we obtain the expansions @xmath461notice that the integrals in eq .",
    "( [ intxgran ] ) are of the order of @xmath462 , so the terms in this expansion decrease with powers of @xmath463 .",

    ", keeping terms up to @xmath467 in the expansion gives a precision @xmath468 .",
    "as a rough estimation of the error of the truncated expansion , we note that the @xmath469-th term is @xmath470 and the error is given by the ratio of the @xmath471-th term to the first term , @xmath472 .",
