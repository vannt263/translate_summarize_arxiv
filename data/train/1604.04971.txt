    "as an essential task in many areas of quantum information science ranging from quantum information processing  @xcite and coherent manipulation of quantum systems  @xcite to high - precision measurements  @xcite , the quantum - state engineering ( qse )  @xcite , has attracted much attention , which promotes the development of experimental technique and theoretical scheme . the quantum adiabatic theorem ( qat ) , an important way of realizing qse , has been widely studied and the basic properties of the qat are being scrutinized both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the basic idea of qat can be summarized as follows : if the control parameters in the time - dependent hamiltonian change slowly , the system will follow closely along an eigenstate trajectory up to a adiabatic phase factor when it is initially in one of the eigenstates .",
    "thereinto , the adiabatic phase is a complicated factor which can be divide into dynamical phase and geometrical phase  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , in the hermitian adiabatic hamiltonians scenario , one can focus on the dynamics of the eigenstate , and neglect the complicated phase factor since it can be discarded as the common pure phase",
    ". however , in practice the quantum system inevitably interacts with the surrounding environment , e.g. the non - hermitian ( nh ) systems  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the complicated adiabatic phase factor could not be simply discarded as the common pure phase any more , since it generally is not a pure ( real ) phase factor .",
    "then , the ideal robustness and the intended dynamics may be spoiled by the accumulation of the imaginary part of the adiabatic phase due to noise and undesired interactions .",
    "thus , it is very worthwhile to look for the novel methods which are robustness , and figure out the strict adiabaticity condition for nh hamiltonians when taking into account the effect of adiabatic phase .",
    "in fact , several authors have paid attention to the study of adiabaticity in nh systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , miniatura _ et al .",
    "_ have set a rough estimate of an adiabaticity condition by analogy with the hermitian counterpart and recognized the importance of the nonadiabatic transition  @xcite .",
    "subsequently , sun has devoted to the generalization of the high - order adiabatic approximation method for the nh quantum systems by using perturbation theory and integration by parts , and obtained an adiabaticity condition similar to the hermitian one with the damping factor and the oscillating factor  @xcite . recently , dridi _ et al . _",
    "have established a generalization of the davis - dykhne - pechukas formula by the complex time method and showed a general adiabatic approximation for lossy two - state models  @xcite .",
    "more recently , ibez and muga have generalized the concept of population for nh systems to characterize adiabaticity and worked out an approximate adiabaticity criterion  @xcite .",
    "indeed , the adiabaticity of a given nh system has been discussed well with those excellent methods  @xcite .",
    "however , in principle above methods did nt give a clear quantitative analysis about the dynamics of the bare state in the eigenstate and the adiabatic phase .",
    "in some cases , we may observe a false adiabaticity due to the problematic or obscure population concept  @xcite .",
    "in addition , they will also be limited severely by the presence of the strong dissipation effects in some applications  @xcite . above problems",
    "make designing perfect scheme to reach the intended dynamics for the nh systems very challenging .    in this paper",
    ", we will introduce a novel method to solve the problems shown above .",
    "different from the previous schemes  @xcite which are proposed to explore the adiabatic approximation condition for a given nh system , we are dedicated to setting a strict adiabaticity condition to make the adiabatic evolution non lossy when taking into account the effect of adiabatic phase , and exploring the hamiltonian which will exactly satisfy the strict condition via the reverse engineering method .",
    "the scheme has following advantages : ( 1 ) we take the effect of adiabatic phase into consideration , and make the adiabatic process be a strict one without lossy in nh system .",
    "( 2 ) by using the reverse engineering method , we can design the hamiltonian to realize the intended dynamics according to the demand .",
    "( 3 ) the noise or certain dissipation in the systems can do positive job in the scheme . we can obtain the desired target state by adjusting extra rotating magnetic fields at a predefined time even in the dissipative system .",
    "therefore , the scheme makes it possible to realize the qse for some dissipative systems .",
    "the rest of this paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ section : ii ] , we briefly review some important properties of the nh hamiltonians , and build a strict adiabaticity condition which contains two parts : an auxiliary adiabaticity condition with respect to adiabatic phase and a general adiabatic condition given via the feshbach p - q partitioning technique  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ section : iii ] , we explicitly discuss how to engineer the nh hamiltonian which could exactly satisfy the strict adiabaticity condition . then , we consider a concrete two - level system example to show the usefulness of our reverse engineering method . both experimental feasibility and population engineering",

    "[ fig1](a ) , when the dissipation rate @xmath174 is a constant ( @xmath174=@xmath199 ) , the shape of the magnetic fields are not very complex and the maximum value of the magnetic fields ( @xmath200 ) is about @xmath201 . from an experimental view point , if @xmath202=@xmath203 khz , @xmath200 is about @xmath204 mhz , which is feasible with present experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "thus , the magnetic fields in our scheme are not hard to be realized in practice .",
    "[ fig1](a ) and [ fig1](b ) share the same dissipation rate @xmath174 , while the parameters in @xmath166 and @xmath167 are different .",
    "in fact , we are also interested in the time evolution of magnetic fields for a dissipation system with a time - dependent dissipation rate @xmath174 . without loss of generality , we take a gaussian dissipation rate @xmath174 as an example @xmath205},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath206 is a constant frequency , while @xmath34 and @xmath207 are time constants",
    ". we should emphasize that @xmath34 is related to the time scale of @xmath174 physically , it should be chosen appropriately to keep the validity of the noise or certain dissipation .",
    "figures  [ fig1](c ) and [ fig1](d ) display the time evolution of magnetic fields with different @xmath34 , while the others parameters are identical . apparently , the magnetic fields in figs .  [ fig1](b ) and [ fig1](c ) are similar to the magnetic fields in fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) , all of them are feasible in practice . however , the magnetic fields in fig .  [ fig1](d ) are quite different from others .",
    "we can clearly see that magnetic fields in most of time can be neglected , specially , @xmath123 is equal to zero for a long time , which means the invalidity of the consistency condition ( @xmath208 , since @xmath123 is also associated with the difference between the eigenvalues of the system physically ) .",
    "therefore , the choice of the parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) is problematic or false .",
    "now we start to study the population engineering of the bare state in the target state .",
    "however , as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 10 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 12 ] ) , the target state seems to be no natural normalization .",
    "for an intuitive grasp of the change of the population engineering of the bare basic , we will use the relative population @xmath209 @xmath210=@xmath211 to study the effects of different magnetic fields on the population engineering , where the relative population is defined as @xmath209=@xmath212+@xmath213 , and @xmath214 is the population for the bare state @xmath215 .",
    "we consider a realistic case of an extremely small population in the bare state @xmath216 for the initial state @xmath217 where @xmath193 is an extremely small constant . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we plot the time evolution of the relative populations for the bare states @xmath218 and @xmath216 with the same parameters as shown in the caption of fig .",
    "we can find that the relative populations @xmath219 and @xmath220 almost have the same evolving tendency in figs .  [ fig2](a ) and [ fig2](c ) , and a perfect full relative population inversion",
    "is complied when @xmath221=@xmath222 .",
    "it should be noted that the time for a full relative population inversion is about 50 ns which is short , if @xmath202=@xmath223@xmath54@xmath224 khz .",
    "figure  [ fig2](b ) also clearly shows a full relative population inversion when @xmath225@xmath226@xmath227 . however , the time evolution of the relative populations in fig .  [ fig2](d ) are complicated , which are quite different from others .",
    "the reason for this result is that the choice of the parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) is problematic or false , more particularly , the @xmath34 is too short and the consistency condition is invalid in this case .    to judge the validity of our scheme for adiabatically driving",
    ", we should compare the real population engineering with the ideal population engineering [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 10 ] ) ] . the ideal population engineering with different @xmath106",
    "are given in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 - 10 ] ) , the ideal population engineering only depends on the @xmath143 design . in other words",
    ", the population engineering will be identical for the same @xmath143 design independent of other parameters .",
    "thus , if our scheme is valid , figs .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , [ fig2](c ) and [ fig3](a ) ( figs .  [ fig2](b ) and [ fig3](b ) ) should be identical , since the @xmath143 designs for them are identical .",
    "obviously , the results are consistent with our deduction , hence our scheme can work well even under noise if the parameters are chosen appropriately .",
    "in addition , we can get more interested target states with different @xmath143 designs .",
    "we have generalized the quantum adiabatic theorem to the nh system and provided a strict adiabaticity condition to make the adiabatic evolution non lossy .",
    "the strict adiabaticity condition can be regarded as a non - trivial generalization of adiabaticity conditions for the hermitian hamiltonians presented by jing _ et al . _",
    "@xcite . according to the strict adiabaticity condition",
    ", one should eliminate the non - adiabatic couplings and the effect of the imaginary part of adiabatic phase as much as possible .",
    "the nh hamiltonian reverse engineering method has been proposed to adiabatically drive an artificial quantum state .",
    "a concrete two - level system example was discussed to show the usefulness of the reverse engineering method in the paper , and numerical simulation showed that our scheme can work well even under noise if the parameters are chosen appropriately .",
    "furthermore , we can obtain the desired target state by adjusting extra rotating magnetic fields at a predefined time .",
    "specifically , the noise or certain dissipation in the systems are no longer undesirable , but play a positive role in our scheme .",
    "therefore , our scheme is powerful and reliable for the quantum information processing .    the present work bears some common elements with the quantum control in open quantum systems , including the idea of using dissipation as a resource ( e.g. dissipative quantum dynamics ( dqd )  @xcite and the nh shortcuts to adiabaticity schemes  @xcite ) ,",
    "so it is worth stressing the similarities and differences .",
    "in fact , the basic idea of dqd can be summarized as follows : the interaction between the system and the environment is modulated to make the target state become the stationary state of the system .",
    "therefore , some specific dissipative factors are no longer undesirable , but can be regarded as the important resources . for the nh shortcuts to adiabaticity schemes ,",
    "the dissipative factors are also introduced to the system to cancel somehow the non - adiabatic losses . in this way",
    ", one can improve dramatically the fidelity of the adiabatic passage .",
    "however , a common problem which one may encounter via dqd or the nh shortcuts to adiabaticity is how to use the specific dissipative factors or employ the appropriate interaction between the system and the environment .",
    "furthermore , those methods may also be limited severely for some applications ( the non - adiabatic dynamics processes ) , since the starting point of them generally is to improve a given ( adiabatic ) dynamics process .    among the differences with the present works  @xcite ,",
    "the most prominent point is : using the reverse engineering method , we can easily obtain the hamiltonian to realize the intended dynamics without loss , which allows one to design the hamiltonian according to the demand .",
    "the main task we should consider is how to physically realize the resulting nh hamiltonian .",
    "sometimes , the resulting nh hamiltonian may be hard to be realized ( a common potential problem of the nh shortcuts to adiabaticity ) .",
    "however , we should note that the difficulty to realize the nh hamiltonian may be solved by enlarging the system with the aid of naimark extensions  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in a sense , all the resulting nh hamiltonian ( even the problematic nh hamiltonian ) may help us with a deeper understanding on the problem : which dissipative factors are the specific dissipative factors that can be used as a resource to realize qse , and promote the development of quantum information science in nh system frames .",
    "furthermore , any quantum system whose hamiltonian is possible to be simplified into the form in eq .",
    "( [ eqx-5 ] ) ( the basic for the simplified hamiltonian can be arbitrary dressed states , as long as , the dressed states satisfy the biorthogonality relation and closure relation ) , the scheme can be implemented straightforward .",
    "this might lead to a useful step toward realizing fast and noise - resistant quantum information processing for multi - qubit systems in current technology .",
    "the applications or extensions of this work may be in fields , such as @xmath3-dimensional systems  @xcite ( for instance , the three - dimensional systems for the stimulated raman adiabatic passage ) , superadiabatic treatments @xcite , and non - adiabatic evolution of nh quantum systems @xcite .",
