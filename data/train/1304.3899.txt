    "nuclear rings in barred galaxies are sites of intense star formation ( e.g. , @xcite ) . these rings are thought to form as a result of nonlinear interactions of gas with a non - axisymmetric bar potential ( e.g. , @xcite ) . due to the bar torque",
    ", the gas readily forms dust - lane shocks in the bar region and flows inward along the dust lanes .",
    "the inflowing gas speeds up gradually in the azimuthal direction as it moves inward , and shapes into a ring very close to the galaxy center ( e.g. , @xcite ) . consequently , nuclear rings have very large surface densities and short dynamical time scales , capable of triggering starburst activity",
    ".    there are some important observational results that may provide clues as to how star formation occurs in the nuclear rings .",
    "first of all , observations indicate that the star formation rate ( sfr ) in the nuclear rings appears to vary with time , and differs considerably from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "analyses of various population synthesis models for a sample of galaxies reveal that the strength of observed emission lines from the nuclear rings is best described by multiple starburst activities over the last @xmath0 or so , rather than by a constant star formation rate ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for 22 nuclear rings",
    ", @xcite found that the present sfrs are widely distributed in the range @xmath1@xmath2 .",
    "it appears that the sfr is largely insensitive to the total molecular mass in a ring , but can be strongly affected by the bar strength .",
    "for instance , the ring in a strongly - barred galaxy ngc 4314 has a relatively low sfr at @xmath3 @xcite , which is about an order of magnitude smaller than that in a weakly - barred galaxy ngc 1326 @xcite , although the total molecular mass contained in the ring is within a factor of two .",
    "in fact , the sfrs given in @xcite combined with the bar strength presented by @xcite show that strongly - barred galaxies tend to have a very small sfr in the rings , while weakly - barred galaxies have a wide range of the sfrs .",
    "second , based on the spatial distributions of star - forming regions in nuclear rings , @xcite proposed two models of star formation : `` popcorn '' and `` pearls on a string '' models ( see also @xcite ) . in the first popcorn model ,",
    "star formation occurs in dense clumps that are randomly distributed along a nuclear ring .",
    "this type of star formation , presumably caused by gravitational instability of the ring itself @xcite , does not produce a systematic gradient in the ages of young star clusters along the azimuthal direction ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) . in the second pearls - on - a - string model",
    ", on the other hand , star formation takes place preferentially at the contact points between a ring and dust lanes .",
    "this may happen because gas clouds with the largest densities are usually placed at the contact points due to orbit crowding ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "since star clusters age as they orbit along the ring , this model naturally predicts a bipolar azimuthal age gradient of star clusters starting from the contact points ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that @xmath4 of the nuclear rings in their sample galaxies show azimuthal age gradients and that such galaxies have , on average , a larger value of the mean sfr than those without noticeable age gradients .    another interesting observational result concerns radial locations of star clusters relative to the nuclear rings . in some galaxies such as ngc",
    "1512 @xcite and ngc 4314 @xcite , young star clusters are located at larger radii than the dense gas of nuclear rings . @xcite also reported that out of 123 barred galaxies in their sample , eight galaxies have strong nuclear spirals , all of which have star - forming regions outside the rings . by analyzing multi - waveband hst archive data of ngc 1672 ,",
    "@xcite recently identified hundreds of young and old star clusters with ages in the range @xmath5 .",
    "they found that the clusters in the nuclear regions exhibit a systematic positive radial age gradient , such that older clusters tend to be located at larger galactocentric radii , farther away from the ring .",
    "proposed mechanisms for the radial age gradient include the decrease in the ring size due to angular momentum loss @xcite and migration of clusters due to tidal interactions with the ring @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have been a powerful tool to study formation and evolution of bar substructures such as dust lanes , nuclear rings , and nuclear spirals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , @xcite showed that dust lanes are shocks formed at the downstream side from the bar major axis .",
    "dust lanes tend to be shorter and located closer to the bar major axis as the gas sound speed increases @xcite .",
    "very recently , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) ran various models with differing bar strength and demonstrated that nuclear rings form not by resonant interactions of the gas with the bar potential , as was previously thought , but instead by the centrifugal barrier that the inflowing gas with non - vanishing angular momentum can not overcome . according to this idea , a more massive bar forms stronger dust - lane shocks which remove angular momentum more efficiently from the gas , so that the inflowing gas is able to move inward closer to the galaxy center , forming a smaller nuclear ring .",
    "this turns out entirely consistent with the observational result of @xcite that `` stronger bars host smaller rings '' .",
    "magnetic stress at the dust lanes takes away angular momentum additionally , leading to an even smaller ring compared to the unmagnetized counterpart @xcite .",
    "paper i also showed that nuclear spirals that form inside nuclear rings unwind with time due to the nonlinear effect @xcite , with an unwinding rate higher for a stronger bar .",
    "thus , the probability of having more tightly wound spirals is larger for galaxies with a weaker bar , consistent with the observational result of @xcite .    while the numerical studies mentioned above are useful to understand gas dynamics in the central regions of barred galaxies , they are without self - gravity and/or prescriptions for star formation .",
    "there have been only a few numerical studies that considered star formation in nuclear rings in a self - consistent way .",
    "@xcite studied star formation in galactic disks that are unstable to bar formation . using a smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph )",
    "combined with @xmath6-body method , they found that star formation in barred galaxies occurs episodically , with a time scale of @xmath7 , and that the associated sfr is well correlated with the mass accretion rate to the central black hole ( bh ) .",
    "these were confirmed by @xcite who also found that turbulence driven by star formation tends to widen nuclear rings .",
    "@xcite used another sph@xmath8-body method to run various models with differing parameters , finding that star formation in the nuclear regions first experiences a burst phase before entering a quiescent phase ( see also @xcite ) . since these authors employed a small number ( @xmath9 ) of gas particles in their models , however , they were unable to resolve the nuclear regions well .",
    "@xcite ran sph simulations for star formation specific to the central molecular zone in the milky way .",
    "while @xcite studied cluster age distributions in spiral and barred galaxies , their results were based on sph simulations that did not consider star formation and feedback .    in this paper , we extend paper i by including self - gravity and a prescription for star formation feedback .",
    "we focus on temporal and spatial distributions of star formation occurring in nuclear rings of strongly - barred galaxies . unlike the previous sph simulations with star formation , our models use a grid - based , cylindrical code with high spatial resolution in the central regions .",
    "we also allow for time delays between star formation and feedback , which is crucial to study age gradients of star clusters that form in nuclear rings .",
    "our main objectives are to address important questions such as what controls the sfr in the nuclear rings and what are responsible for the presence ( or absence ) of the age gradients of star clusters in the rings , mentioned above .",
    "we take a simple galaxy model in which a self - gravitating gaseous disk with either uniform or exponential density distribution is placed under the influence of a non - axisymmetric bar potential .",
    "we implement a stochastic prescription for star formation that takes allowance for a threshold density as well as a star formation efficiency .",
    "star formation feedback is treated only through direct momentum injections from supernova ( sn ) explosions occurring @xmath10 after star formation events . by considering an isothermal equation of state",
    ", we do not consider gas cooling and heating , and radiative feedback , which may be important in regulating star formation in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in our models ,",
    "the bar potential is turned on slowly over time , which not only represents a situation where the bar forms and grows but also helps avoid abrupt gas responses . in each model",
    ", we measure the sfr in the ring and study its dependence on various quantities such as the gas mass in the ring , mass inflow rates to the central regions , bar growth time , etc .",
    "we also explore temporal and spatial variations of star - forming regions and their connection to the sfr .",
    "in addition , we study physical properties of star clusters and gas clouds in the rings and compare them with observational results available .    we remark on a few important limitations of our models from the outset .",
    "first of all , our gaseous disks are two - dimensional and razor - thin .",
    "this ignores potential dynamical consequences of vertical gas motions and related mixing , which was shown important in inducing non - steady gas motions across spiral shocks ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "second , we adopt an isothermal equation of state for the gas , corresponding to the warm phase , and do not consider radiative cooling and heating required for production and transitions of multiphase gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also ignore the effects of outflows , winds , and radiative feedback from young stars , which may be of crucial importance in setting up the equilibrium pressure in galactic planes , thereby regulating star formation in disk galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , we in the present work do not consider the effects of spiral arms that may supply gas to the bar regions . with these caveats ,",
    "the numerical models presented in this paper should be considered as a first step toward more realistic modeling of star formation in nuclear rings .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the numerical methods and parameters used for our time - dependent simulations . in section 3",
    ", we present the temporal evolution of sfrs , and their dependence on the model parameters .",
    "the age gradients of star clusters in the azimuthal and radial directions as well as properties of star clusters and dense clouds are discussed in section 4 . in section 5 , we summarize our main results and discuss their astronomical implications .",
    "to study star formation in nuclear rings of barred galaxies , we extend the numerical models studied in paper i by including self - gravity , conversion of gas to stars , and feedback from star formation . in this section ,",
    "we briefly summarize the current models and describe our handling of star formation and feedback .",
    "the reader is referred to paper i for more detailed description of the numerical models .",
    "we initially consider an infinitesimally - thin , rotating disk .",
    "the disk is assumed to be unmagnetized and isothermal with sound speed of @xmath11 .",
    "the external gravitational potential responsible for the disk rotation consists of four components : a stellar disk , a stellar bulge , a non - axisymmetric stellar bar , and a central bh with mass @xmath12 .",
    "this gives rise to a rotation curve that is almost flat at @xmath13 in the bar region and its outside .",
    "the presence of the bh makes the rotation velocity rise as @xmath14 toward the galaxy center .",
    "the bar potential is modeled by a @xcite prolate spheroid with semi - major and minor axes of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "the bar is rigidly rotating with a pattern speed @xmath17 , which places the corotation resonance radius at @xmath18 and the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) radius at @xmath19 .",
    "the corresponding orbital time is @xmath20 . in our models ,",
    "the bar potential is turned on over the bar growth time scale @xmath21 , while the central density of the spheroidal component ( bar plus bulge ) is kept fixed .",
    "we vary @xmath21 to study situations where the bar grows at a different rate .",
    "the mass of the bar , when it is fully turned on , is set to 30% of the total mass of the spheroidal component within @xmath22 .",

    "our models consider conversion of gas to stars , as will be explained in section [ sec : sf ] in detail .",
    "since the total gas mass transformed to stars is significant , it is important to evolve them under the combined gravitational potential of the gas and stars . at each time step , we calculate the stellar surface density on the grid points via the triangular - shaped - cloud assignment scheme @xcite from the distribution of stellar particles .",
    "we then solve the poisson equation to obtain the gravitational potential of the total ( gas plus star ) surface density , using the @xcite method presented in @xcite . to allow for dilution of gravity due to finite thickness @xmath34 of the combined disk ,",

    "all the models initially have a toomre @xmath45 parameter greater than unity , so that they are gravitationally stable in the absence of a bar potential",
    ". however , nuclear rings that form near the center achieve large density , enough to undergo runaway collapse to form stars .      to model star formation and ensuing feedback",
    ", we first identify high - density regions whose average surface density @xmath46 within a radius @xmath47 exceeds a critical density . the natural choice for the threshold density would be @xmath48 from the jeans condition .",
    "while it is desirable to choose a small value for the sizes of star - forming regions , we take @xmath49 because of numerical resolution : a star - forming cloud at @xmath50 encloses typically @xmath51 grid points .",
    "not all clouds with @xmath52 immediately undergo gravitational collapse and star formation since we need to consider the star formation efficiency as well as the computational time step @xcite .",
    "the sfr expected from a cloud with mass @xmath53 , from the @xcite law , is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the star formation efficiency per free - fall time , @xmath56 , defined by @xmath57 assuming a disk scale height of @xmath58 .",
    "we take @xmath59 , consistent with theoretical and observational estimates ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the star formation probability of an eligible cloud with @xmath60 in a time interval @xmath61 is then given by @xmath62 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for a given computational time step @xmath61 , the probability @xmath63 calculated in our models is typically @xmath64 , much smaller than unity . in each time step",

    "each particle has a mass in the range @xmath68 , which is about @xmath69 times larger than the masses of observed clusters in nuclear rings ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a massive single particle in our models can be regarded as representing an unresolved group of star clusters rather than an individual cluster .",
    "we treat sn feedback using simple momentum input to the surrounding gaseous medium .",
    "we consider only type ii sn events since our models run only until @xmath23 . since we do not resolve individual stars in a cluster or their group , we assume that all sn explosions occur simultaneously .",
    "stars with mass between @xmath70 and @xmath71 explode as type ii sne @xcite , which comprise about 7% of the cluster mass under the @xcite initial mass function .",
    "the mean mass of sn progenitors is then @xmath72 , indicating that the number of sne exploding from a cluster ( or their group ) with mass @xmath67 is @xmath73 , with the total ejected mass @xmath74 returning back to the ism . between star formation and sn explosions ,",
    "we allow a time delay of @xmath10 , corresponding to the mean life time of type ii sn progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite ) . note that the orbital time of gas in nuclear rings is typically @xmath75 in our models , so that star clusters move by about @xmath76 in the azimuthal angle from the formation sites before experiencing sn explosions .",
    "each feedback , corresponding to @xmath77 simultaneous sne , injects mass and radial momentum in the form of an expanding shell . in the momentum - conserving stage ,",
    "a single sn with energy @xmath78 would drive radial momentum @xmath79 to the surrounding gas if the background medium is uniform and in three dimensions , where @xmath80 is the sn energy in units of @xmath78 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath81 on @xmath82 is due to the fact that the shell expansion in the sedov phase is slow when the background surface density is large .",
    "since our model disks are razor - thin by ignoring the vertical direction , the momentum imparted to the gas in the simulation domain would be smaller than @xmath81 .",
    "let @xmath39 denote the fraction of the total radial momentum that goes into the in - plane direction .",
    "if the expansion is isotropic , @xmath83 @xcite , but @xmath39 can be smaller in a vertically stratified disk since it is easier for a shell to expand along the vertical direction .",
    "the total momentum of a shell from each feedback is thus set to @xmath84 in this paper , we take @xmath44 as a standard value , but run some models with lower @xmath39 to study the effect of @xmath39 on the sfr ( see table [ tbl : model ] ) .    as the initial radius of a shell , we take @xmath85 , corresponding to the shell size at the end of the sedov phase when @xmath86 and the background density is @xmath87 , the typical mean density of nuclear rings when star formation is active . when feedback occurs from a particle ,",
    "we redistribute the mass and momentum within a circular region with radius @xmath88 centered at the particle by taking their spatial averages .",

    "note that @xmath95 ensures an initially divergence - free condition at the feedback center ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in this section , we first describe overall evolution of our numerical simulations .",

    "the gas inside the corotation resonance is rotating in the counterclockwise direction",
    ".        early evolution of model u20 before @xmath102 is not much different from non - self - gravitating models presented in @xcite .",
    "the imposed non - axisymmetric bar potential perturbs gas orbits to create overdense ridges at the far downstream side from the bar major axis .",
    "only the region inside the outermost @xmath96-orbit responds strongly to the bar potential .",
    "before the bar is fully turned on ( i.e. , @xmath103 ) , no closed @xmath96- and @xmath104-orbits exist since the external gravitational potential varies with time . during this time , the gas streamlines are highly transient as they try to adjust to the time - varying potential .",
    "the overdense ridges grow with time and move slowly toward the bar major axis , developing into dust - lane shocks .",
    "the gas passing through the shocks loses angular momentum and flows radially inward along the dust lanes .",
    "the radial velocity of the inflowing gas is so large that it is not halted at the ilr ( paper i ) .",

    "note that the shape of the ring in model u20 at @xmath105 is remarkably similar to that of a highly - elongated nuclear ring in eso 565 - 11 observed by @xcite , although the latter is @xmath106@xmath107 times bigger than the former . ] to illustrate this more clearly , figure [ fig : ring ] plots the temporal and radial variations of the azimuthally averaged surface density in the central regions of model u20 and its non - self - gravitating counterpart , model nosg .",
    "the horizontal dashed line marks the location of the ilr .",
    "the ring is beginning to form at @xmath108 at the galactocentric radius of @xmath50 , well inside the ilr . at early time when the bar is growing ,",
    "the ring is not in an equilibrium position and its shape is quite different from @xmath104-orbits : the major axis of the ring is inclined to the @xmath97-axis by @xmath109 at @xmath105 ( fig .  [ fig : snap]a ) .",
    "as the ring material continuously interacts with the bar potential , the contact points rotate in the counterclockwise direction . at @xmath110 ,",
    "the ring settles on one of the @xmath104-orbits , and the contact points are located close the bar minor axis .    at the same time , the ring becomes smaller in size due to the addition of low - angular momentum gas from outside as well as by collisions of the ring material whose orbits are perturbed by thermal pressure ( paper i ) .",
    "when self - gravity is absent , the decreasing rate of the ring radius is @xmath111 until @xmath112 . after this time , the ring is so small that strong centrifugal force inhibits further decay of the ring . in model",
    "u20 with self - gravity included , on the other hand , strong self - gravitational potential of the ring makes the gas orbits relatively intact , reducing the ring decay rate to @xmath113 .",
    "the decrease of the ring size in turn causes the contact points to move radially inward and rotate further in the counterclockwise direction ( but not more than @xmath114 ) .    as figure [ fig : snap ]",
    "shows , the bar region ( i.e. , inside the outermost-@xmath96 orbit ) becomes evacuated quite rapidly .",
    "this is because the bar potential is efficient in removing angular momentum from the gas only in the bar region , while its influence on the gas orbits outside the outermost-@xmath96 orbit is not significant . by @xmath115 ,",
    "most of the gas in the bar region is transferred to the ring .",
    "the amount of the gas added to the bar region from outside is much smaller than that lost to the ring , which causes the mass inflow rate to the ring to decrease dramatically with time ( see section [ sec : sfr ] ) .",
    "figure [ fig : snap]d shows that at late time there is a substantial amount of gas trapped in around an @xmath96-orbit with @xmath116 and @xmath117 , shown as a dotted line .",
    "this elongated gaseous structure circumscribing the dust lanes and nuclear ring is called the inner ring ( e.g. , @xcite ) : we term the corresponding @xmath96-orbit the inner - ring @xmath96-orbits .",
    "the formation of the inner ring in our model is as follows .",
    "as mentioned before , the dust - lane shocks form first at far downstream and moves toward the bar major axis as the bar potential grows . during this time ,",
    "much of the gas in the bar region infalls to the nuclear region . near the time when the bar attains its full strength ,",
    "the dust lanes find their equilibrium positions on an @xmath96-orbit , still at the leading side from the bar major axis .",
    "the inner ring starts to form at this time , by gathering the residual material located between the outermost and inner - ring @xmath96-orbits .",
    "some gases located outside the outermost @xmath96-orbit experience collisions near the bar ends where @xmath96-orbits crowd , and are then able to lower their orbits to the inner - ring @xmath96-orbit , increasing the inner - ring mass . in model u20 , the gas added to the inner ring from outside of the outermost @xmath96-orbit is about 70% of the total inner - ring mass at @xmath118 .",
    "most of the gas inside the inner - ring @xmath96-orbit had already transited to the nuclear ring by experiencing the dust - lane shocks before the bar was fully turned on .",
    "figure [ fig : u20 ] plots the time evolution of the sfr , the mass inflow rate to the nuclear ring @xmath119 ( measured at @xmath120 ) , and the total gas mass inside the nuclear ring @xmath121 in model u20 . here",
    "@xmath122 denotes the radial velocity of the gas . in plotting these profiles ,",
    "we take a boxcar average , with a window of @xmath123 . in this model",
    ", the bar potential grows over the time scale of @xmath124 , and the first star formation takes place at the contact points at @xmath125 . as the bar grows further ,",
    "the dust - lane shocks become stronger , increasing the amount of the infalling gas to the ring . @xmath126",
    "attains a peak value @xmath127 at @xmath105 , which coincides with the time of highest density of the dust lanes ( see fig .  5 of paper i ) .",
    "the decay of @xmath126 after the peak is caused by the fact that only the gas inside the outermost @xmath96-orbit responds strongly to the bar potential , while the outer region is not much affected .",
    "similarly , the sfr exhibits a strong burst with a maximum value @xmath127 , which occurs @xmath128 after the peak of @xmath126 .",
    "the associated sn feedback produces many holes in the gas distribution , driving a huge amount of kinetic energy to the surrounding medium .",

    "this method makes use of the gravitational potential of the gas , and thus allows smoother cloud boundaries than the methods based on isodensity surfaces ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . at a given time , we search for all the local minima of the gravitational potential and find the largest closed potential contour encompassing one and only one potential minimum .",

    "the average value of the virial parameter is @xmath214 , so that they are gravitationally bound , consistent with the observed cloud properties in nuclear rings of barred galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we have presented the results of two - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of star formation occurring in nuclear rings of barred galaxies .",
    "we initially consider an infinitesimally thin , isothermal gas disk placed under the external gravitational potential .",
    "the external potential consists of a stellar disk , a stellar bulge , a central bh , and a non - axisymmetric stellar bar .",
    "we do not study the effect of spiral arms in the present work .",
    "the bar potential is modeled by a ferrers prolate spheroid with the semi - major and minor axes of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively , and rotates about the galaxy center with a patten speed of @xmath215 .",
    "the bar mass , when it is fully turned on , is set to 30% of the total stellar mass in the spheroidal component , corresponding to a strongly barred galaxy .",
    "we fix the gas sound speed to @xmath11 and the bh mass to @xmath216 .",
    "our simulations incorporate star formation recipes that include a density threshold corresponding to the jeans condition , a star formation efficiency , conversion of gas to particles representing star clusters or their groups , and delayed momentum feedback via sn explosions . to explore various situations , we consider both uniform and exponential density models , and vary the gas surface density , bar growth time , and the total momentum injection in the in - plane direction .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarized as follows .",
    "the imposed bar potential readily induces a pair of dust - lane shocks in the bar region inside the outermost @xmath96-orbit . at early time when the bar potential is weak",
    ", the dust - lane shocks are placed at the far downstream side from the bar major axis .",
    "as the bar potential increases , the dust - lane shocks become stronger and slowly move toward the bar major axis .",
    "the gas passing through the shocks loses a significant amount of angular momentum , infalls radially along the dust lanes , and forms a nuclear ring .",
    "the continuous gas inflows provide a fuel for star formation in the ring .",
    "after the bar potential reaches its full strength , the dust lanes settle on an @xmath96-orbit , while the nuclear ring follows an @xmath104-orbit .",
    "the remaining gas located inside the outermost @xmath96-orbit and outside the dust lanes is gathered to form an elongated inner ring in the bar region , whose shape is well described by an @xmath96-orbit , as well",
    ". some of the gas located outside the outermost @xmath96-orbit transits to the inner ring near the bar ends where @xmath96-orbits crowd .",
    "similarly , the gas in the inner ring loses angular momentum when it collides with other gas near the bar ends , slowly infalling to the nuclear ring through the dust lanes .",
    "the contact points between the dust lanes and the nuclear ring is a tunnel through which the inflowing gas on @xmath96-orbits switches to the @xmath104-orbit of the nuclear ring . about the time when the bar potential is fully turned on , the contact points are located near the bar minor axis . over time , the nuclear ring shrinks in size due to the addition of low angular momentum gas from outside and by collisions of the ring material , which in turn makes the contact points rotate slowly in the counterclockwise direction .",
    "since the contact points have largest density in the nuclear ring , they are preferred sites of star formation , although star - forming regions can be distributed throughout the ring when the mass inflow rate is high .",
    "the bar potential transports the gas in the bar region to the nuclear ring very efficiently , but does not have strong influence on the gas orbits outside the bar region .",
    "this not only makes the bar region evacuated rapidly but also reduces the mass inflow rate @xmath126 dramatically after @xmath217 .",
    "the sfr in nuclear rings displays a single primary burst followed by a few secondary bursts before becoming reduced to small values .",
    "the primary burst is associated with the massive gas inflow along the dust lanes caused by the growth of the bar potential .",
    "the duration and maximum rate of the primary burst depend on the growth time of the bar potential , in such a way that a slower bar growth results in a more prolonged and reduced sfr .",
    "the secondary bursts are due to the re - entry of the ejected and swept - up gas by sn feedback from the nuclear ring out to the bar - end regions .",
    "time intervals between the secondary bursts are roughly @xmath137 .",
    "the peak sfr is attained at @xmath218 , and the duration of active star formation is roughly a half of the bar growth time .",
    "the sfr is almost equal to @xmath126 .",
    "it has a weak dependence on the total gas mass @xmath121 in the ring when @xmath148 , and is not correlated with @xmath121 when @xmath149 .",
    "this suggests that star formation in the ring is controlled primarily by @xmath126 rather than @xmath121 .",
    "the relationship between the sfr surface density and the surface density of dense clumps in nuclear rings found from our numerical models are consistent with the usual kennicutt - schmidt law for circumnuclear starburst galaxies .",
    "the presence or absence of azimuthal age gradients of young star clusters in nuclear rings depends on the sfr ( or @xmath126 ) in our models .",
    "when @xmath126 is small , most of the inflowing gas to the nuclear ring is consumed at the contact points . in this case ,",
    "young star clusters that form would exhibit a well - defined azimuthal age gradient along the ring .",
    "when @xmath126 is large , on the other hand , the contact points are unable to transform all of the inflowing gas to stars .",
    "the extra gas overflows the contact points and goes into the nuclear ring .",
    "the ring becomes massive and forms stars in clumps that become dense enough . in this case , no apparent age gradient of star clusters is expected since star - forming regions are randomly distributed over the whole length of the ring .",
    "the critical value of @xmath126 that determines the presence or absence of the azimuthal age gradient is estimated to be @xmath219 in our models , although it depends on various parameters such as the ring radius , critical density , etc .",
    "( eq .  [ [ eq : sfcp ] ] ) .",
    "star clusters produced also exhibit a positive radial age gradient , such that young clusters are located close to the nuclear ring , while old clusters are found away from the ring .",
    "the primary reason for this is that the nuclear ring becomes smaller in size with time , and thus star - forming regions gradually move radially inward . in our models ,",
    "the radial age gradient amounts to @xmath220 .",
    "radial diffusion of clusters via mutual gravitational interactions and also with the gaseous ring does not affect the radial age gradient much .",
    "when the sfr is large ( @xmath221 ) , some dense clouds are able to grow by accreting surrounding material and form massive clusters .",
    "the cluster mass function is well described by a power law , with slope @xmath222 .",
    "a larger slope corresponds to a more massive disk in which more gas is available for the ring star formation .",
    "when the sfr is small , on the other hand , most clusters form near the threshold density , leading to a steeper slope with @xmath200 .",
    "giant clouds in nuclear rings have typical masses @xmath211 and sizes @xmath206 . driven by momentum injection from sne , their one - dimensional internal velocity dispersions are supersonic at @xmath223 . they are gravitationally bound with the virial parameter of @xmath224 .",
    "we find that the sfr in nuclear rings shows a strong primary burst , with its duration and peak value dependent on the bar growth time , and subsequently a few weak and narrow bursts , after which the sfr becomes very small .",
    "the peak of the primary burst is attained roughly when the bar potential is fully turned on .",
    "this burst behavior of the sfr appears to be a generic feature of star formation in nuclear rings of strongly - barred galaxies found in numerical simulations .",
    "for instance , @xmath6-body@xmath225 sph models presented by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite showed that the sfr reaches its peak value , with narrow bursts superimposed , about the time when the stellar bar fully develops , after which it is reduced to small values . in numerical modeling for star formation in the nuclear region of the milky way",
    ", @xcite found that the sfr is maximized at @xmath226 , with a peak value @xmath227 , and then drops to a relatively constant value @xmath228 .",
    "the sustained star formation in @xcite is thought to arise because the milky way has a very weak bar that takes a long time to clear out gas in the bar region . in this case",
    ", the gas infall may proceed continuously over an extended period of time , a situation similar to the case with a slowly - growing bar .",
    "there is observational evidence that star formation in nuclear rings occurs continually over a long period of time ( a few gyrs ) with successive @xmath229 bursts separated by a few tenths of gyrs each ( e.g. , @xcite ; see also @xcite ) .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to our numerical results that show that star formation in nuclear rings is dominated by one primary burst before declining to small values , with @xmath230 duration of active star formation .",
    "this discrepancy is mostly likely due to the fact that our models consider only a bar potential for angular momentum transport and thus are too simple to describe more complicated mass inflows in real disk galaxies .",
    "if the mass inflow rate to a nuclear ring really controls the sfr in the ring , as found by our numerical models , the observational results call for a need to feed the rings with gas episodically for a long time interval .",
    "_ the bar potential alone is unlikely responsible for gas supply needed for star formation in real nuclear rings . _",
    "unless bars are dynamically young , present star formation in nuclear rings of nearby barred galaxies requires additional gas feeding .",
    "one obvious such mechanism is spiral arms that can remove angular momentum at spiral shocks to transport gas from outer disks to the bar regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is not considered in the present work .",
    "accretion of halo gas to the disk may not only rejuvenate bars ( e.g. , @xcite ) but also enhance the sfr in the rings ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such gas flows might actually exist , as evidenced by the presence of an enhanced number of carbon stars in the outer spiral arms of m33 @xcite .",
    "temporal variations in the bar strength ( e.g. , @xcite ) and in the bar pattern speed ( e .. g , @xcite ) are also likely to affect the mass inflow rate to the ring and thus the sfr .    some galaxies such as ic 4933 @xcite show age gradients of star clusters along the azimuthal direction in nuclear rings , while there are other galaxies such as ngc 7552 @xcite that do not show a clear age gradient .",
    "@xcite analyzed h@xmath231 data for 22 nuclear rings and found that about half of their sample galaxies contain azimuthal age gradients , although most of them are not throughout the entire ring .",
    "they also found that the mean sfr in galaxies with azimuthal age gradients is @xmath232 , which is slightly larger than the mean value of @xmath233 for galaxies with no apparent age gradient .",
    "while this appears consistent with our numerical results , the large dispersions in the mean sfrs suggest that there is no fixed sfr that can distinguish between galaxies with and without age gradients .",
    "in addition , the critical sfr for the absence or presence of azimuthal age gradients is about @xmath129 in our models , while most galaxies in the sample of @xcite have @xmath234 . as equation ( [ eq : sfcp ] ) suggests for the maximum sfr , @xmath189 , allowed at the contact points , however , the critical sfr depends on many factors that may vary from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "for example , ngc 1343 with the most clear bi - polar age gradient in the @xcite sample has the current sfr of @xmath235 .",
    "its ring radius is @xmath236 @xcite , which increases the critical sfr by a factor of 4 , assuming that the ring width is proportional to the ring size and the other parameters remain the same .",
    "in addition , @xmath237 , so that the level of interstellar turbulence and the size of star - forming regions @xmath47 may change @xmath189 considerably .",
    "we find that star clusters that form in nuclear rings naturally develop a positive radial gradient of their ages owing primarily to the decrease in the ring size over @xmath238 in our models .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite who found that clusters with ages @xmath239 in the nuclear region of ngc 1672 are older systematically with increasing radius .",
    "note that the radial age gradient holds over a timescale of @xmath238 and may not apply to clusters in a small age range since the decay of the ring size is quite slow .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that two ( ngc 5953 and 7570 ) of their sample galaxies show a negative radial age gradient of regions in the rings .",
    "our numerical results plotted in figure [ fig : radgra ] also show that when limited to clusters with age @xmath240@xmath241 yr at @xmath118 , younger clusters can be found at larger radii , which is due to the stochastic nature of star formation and ensuing gravitational interactions .",
    "our results show that the sfr in the nuclear rings is tightly correlated with the mass inflow rate to the ring rather than the total gas mass in the ring ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_min ] ) .",
    "this result is seemingly consistent with the results of @xcite who found that the sfr in the nuclear ring of a strongly - barred galaxy ngc 4314 is smaller , by a factor of 30 , than that in a weakly - barred galaxy ngc 1326 @xcite , even if the gas mass in the ring is smaller by only a factor of two .",
    "it is interesting to note that the gas mass contained in most `` gas - rich '' nuclear rings of barred galaxies in the bima song sample is in a remarkably narrow range of @xmath242 @xcite .",
    ", a higher - resolution observation of @xcite gives the ring mass of @xmath243 .",
    "] the sfr data presented in @xcite combined with the bar strength given in @xcite show that strongly - barred galaxies usually have very small present - day sfrs and the sfrs in weakly - barred galaxies vary in a wide range , although the number of galaxies in their sample is too limited to make a conclusive statement",
    ". it will be interesting to see how the bar strength as well as gas inflows by spiral shocks influence the sfr in nuclear rings .    while star formation is concentrated in nuclear rings in our models ,",
    "observations indicate that star formation in some galaxies occurs not only in nuclear rings but also in the bar region including dust lanes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while dust lanes themselves are known hostile to star formation due to strong velocity shear ( e.g. , @xcite ) , @xcite proposed that stars form in interbar dust spurs in filamentary shape that impact the dust lanes from the trailing side of the bar ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , @xcite inferred that some clusters in the nuclear ring of ngc 1365 actually formed in one of the dust lanes by the impact of spurs and subsequently migrated inward to the nuclear ring .",
    "the origin of these interbar spurs is yet unclear .",
    "apparently , there is no filamentary interbar feature in our models .",
    "they may originate from gas inflows due to spiral shocks from the region outside the bar @xcite , from interactions of gas with magnetic fields that are pervasive in the bar region @xcite , and/or from other dynamical processes that involve gas cooling , self - gravity , etc .",
    ", which are not considered in the present work .",
    "it will be an important direction of future work to study how spiral arms and magnetic fields affect the gas inflows and star formation in the bar and nuclear regions .",
