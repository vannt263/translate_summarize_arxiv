    "perhaps the simplest wave phenomenon in relativity is the propagation of linearized waves on a fixed , curved background .",
    "when observed at a fixed spatial point , the dynamics of a wave propagating on spherically symmetric , time - independent , asymptotically flat , background geometries consists of three stages : during the first stage , the observed wave depends on the structure of the initial pulse and its reflection from the origin ( burst phase ) .",
    "this phase is followed by an exponentially decaying quasi - normal ringing of the black hole ( quasi - normal phase ) . in the last stage ,",
    "the wave slowly dies off as a power - law tail ( tail phase ) .",
    "the last two phases are dictated by the interference of the part of the wave backscattered at the tail of the potential and the part reflected by the potential barrier .",
    "the tail phenomenon can be understood as due to the scattering of the wave off the effective curvature potential of the background geometry @xcite .",
    "tails have been mostly investigated on schwarzschild backgrounds @xcite , reissner - nordstrom black - holes @xcite , and for collapsing scalar fields@xcite .",
    "the study of tails has also implications in connection with the gravitational radiation emerging from inspiraling binary systems@xcite .    for spherically symmetric systems ,",
    "after separation of variables , the three - dimensional wave equation @xmath0 reduces , in a suitable radial coordinate @xmath1 , to the one - dimensional wave equation : @xmath2\\phi(x , t ) = 0 \\ , , \\label{eq : kg}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 denotes the effective curvature potential .",
    "recently , the late - time behavior of equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) has been the subject of detailed numerical and analytic investigations by gundlach @xcite and ching @xcite .",
    "gundlach @xcite studied both , the late - time behavior of massless fields around a fixed schwarzschild geometry and the full nonlinear evolution of a minimally coupled scalar field .",
    "their study shows a remarkable agreement between the numerically computed quasi - normal frequencies and power - law tails and their corresponding theoretical predictions . using a null characteristic approach",
    ", they found tails not only at timelike infinity , but also at future null infinity and at the future horizon of the black hole .",
    "the time behavior of the tails is shown to be    @xmath4    with @xmath5 if there is an initial static field and @xmath6 otherwise .    pursuing a different approach ,",
    "ching @xcite showed that the late time tail phenomena are governed by the asymptotic structure of the background spacetime .",
    "furthermore , they found that , for non - static initial conditions , the simple power - law @xmath7 in schwarzschild geometries , is not present for general potentials of the form @xmath8 . instead , the generic late - time behavior is given by @xmath9 .    in spite of previous work , a complete understanding of the tail phenomenon for general systems is still missing . questions such as",
    "which factors determine the magnitude and power - law time dependence have not been addressed for a general system .",
    "it is of particular interest , for instance , to show which role the dimensionality of the system plays on the existence of power - law tails@xcite . when the point of view that tails arise from backscattering off an effective potential is adopted , it is not clear whether the tail behavior would remain unchanged , or be present at all , for intrinsically two or three dimensional systems @xcite .    a natural multi - dimensional generalization of the dynamics of scalar fields is obtained by considering the family of kerr spacetimes .",
    "in contrast to the schwarzschild background geometry , the wave equation @xmath10 in the background of a rotating black hole only admits separation of the azimuthal coordinate , so in principle a two - dimensional evolution problem has to be solved .",
    "it has been suggested@xcite , that tails similar to those present in schwarzschild spacetimes should exist on kerr backgrounds , a detailed analysis , however , has not been undertaken .",
    "this study considers the dynamics of scalar fields on the background of rotating black holes in two regimes : slowly and rapidly rotating holes .",
    "a considerable mathematical simplification of the problem is achieved in the case of slowly rotating black holes since the angular momentum can be treated as a perturbative parameter .",
    "thus , to first order in the angular momentum , the scalar wave equation yields two one - dimensional evolution equations .",
    "this formalism is described in section [ formal ] .",
    "results of the numerical calculations are presented in section [ results ] , where power - law tails are discussed .",
    "the case of rapidly rotating black holes is discussed in section [ rapid ] .",
    "using boyer - lindquist coordinates ( @xmath11 ) the wave equation for a massless scalar field @xmath12 reads @xcite @xmath13 \\ , \\partial_{tt } \\phi - \\frac{4mar}{\\delta}\\ , \\partial_{t\\phi } \\phi + \\left[\\frac{1}{\\sin^2\\theta}-\\frac{a^2}{\\delta}\\right ] \\partial_{\\phi\\phi }   \\phi \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\partial_r\\left(\\delta \\partial_r\\phi\\right )   + \\frac{1}{\\sin\\theta}\\partial_\\theta\\left ( \\sin\\theta\\partial_\\theta\\phi\\right ) = 0 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath15 is its angular momentum per unit mass , and @xmath16 .",
    "equation ( [ bl ] ) is equivalent to the special case of the teukolsky equation @xcite for fields with vanishing spin weight .",
    "the schwarzschild case , @xmath17 , allows separation of variables in terms of the scalar spherical harmonics @xmath18 without any requirements on a particular time behavior .",
    "the solution of ( [ bl ] ) can be written in the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the tortoise coordinate @xmath21 substitution of ( [ spheresol ] ) into ( [ bl ] ) , with @xmath17 , yields the one - dimensional wave equation @xmath22 \\,\\psi(t , r^ * ) = 0\\;,\\ ] ] with the potential @xmath23 defined by @xmath24 \\ ; .\\ ] ] it has been shown , in both numerical and analytic studies @xcite , that at a fixed radius the solution of ( [ sphereeq ] ) will fall off as @xmath25 for large @xmath26 and non - static initial data .    for @xmath27 , it is no longer possible to separate variables and arrive at an equation similar to ( [ sphereeq ] ) .",
    "while the azimuthal dependence of @xmath12 can still be described by @xmath28 , a full separation of variables exists only if the time dependence is given by @xmath29 , as first demonstrated by brill @xcite . in this case , both , the teukolsky equation and equation ( [ bl ] ) , admit separable solutions of the form @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the spin - weight-@xmath32 spheroidal harmonics .",
    "however , since the objective of the present study is the late - time dynamics , a decomposition based on @xmath33 modes is not suitable , and one is forced , in principle , to solve a two - dimensional evolution equation for @xmath12 .",
    "nonetheless , the case of slowly rotating black holes circumvents the problem of solving a two - dimensional wave equation .",
    "the use of an azimuthal coordinate defined by asymptotic observers , as is the case with the boyer - lindquist @xmath34 coordinate , introduces unphysical pathologies near the horizon even in the case @xmath35 . a discussion of those pathologies and their precise manifestation in the slow rotation limit is given in the appendix .",

    "the problem has then been reduced to solving the homogeneous equation ( [ numsys0 ] ) for @xmath45 and using this solution as a source in the inhomogeneous equation ( [ numsys1 ] ) .",
    "owing to the one - way membrane character of the horizon , the use of ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon arises most naturally for the solution of ( [ numsys0 ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic form of @xmath45 for @xmath54 is then a wave with constant amplitude propagating to the horizon .    as @xmath55 ( @xmath54 )",

    "the numerical results presented here were computed with a second order staggered in time evolution scheme . for consistency , a null characteristic numerical integration was also used , and the results were in complete agreement .",
    "in general , both @xmath45 and @xmath46 are complex quantities . owing to the purely imaginary coefficients of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath45 in the source term in ( [ numsys1 ] ) ,",

    "since the separation variable @xmath68 plays the role of a scaling factor for the source term in ( [ numsys1 ] ) , in the numerical calculations @xmath69 is used .    the initial data for @xmath45 consist of a bell - shaped pulse propagating outwards given by @xmath70 ^ 8\\ ] ] for @xmath71 , and vanishing otherwise .",

    "the initial conditions for @xmath46 are @xmath75 .",
    "numerical experiments have shown , that the tail behavior is not affected by the choice of initial conditions for @xmath46 .",
    "as previously discussed , the behavior of both the potential and the source term in ( [ numsys1 ] ) makes it possible , in principle , to impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon and outgoing conditions at infinity , i.e.  @xmath76 .",
    "however , in a cauchy evolution , such as the one here under consideration , boundary conditions are imposed at a finite distance @xcite . typically , the computational domains used covered @xmath77 with @xmath78 . since @xmath79 yields @xmath80 , imposing the left ( ingoing into the black hole ) boundary condition at a finite radius @xmath20 turns out to be a suitable approximation ; both , the potential @xmath23 and the source @xmath52 are negligible at @xmath81",
