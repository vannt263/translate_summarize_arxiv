    "the search for supersymmetry ( susy ) is a long - standing important task in particle physics .",
    "one prime motivation for weak - scale susy is that it protects the higgs vacuum expectation value without unnatural fine - tuning of the theory parameters . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ", only a small subset of the supersymmetric partners strongly relates with the naturalness of the higgs potential @xcite .",
    "this can be seen from the minimization of the higgs potential @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 denote the weak scale soft susy breaking masses of the higgs fields .",
    "a moderate or large @xmath18 is assumed in the last approximate equality . @xmath19 and @xmath20 arise from the radiative corrections to the higgs potential , and the one - loop dominant contribution to @xmath19 is given by @xcite @xmath21 in order to obtain the observed value of @xmath22 without large cancelations in eq .",
    "( [ minimization ] ) , each term on the right hand side should be comparable in magnitude .",
    "thus , the higgsino mass @xmath15 must be of the order of @xmath23 gev and the requirement of @xmath24 produces an upper bound on the stop mass , which is about 500 gev @xcite ( a 125 gev higgs mass can be achieved by a large stop trilinear coupling without very heavy stops in the mssm or achieved by extending the mssm with additional d - terms or f - terms @xcite ) . in addition , since the gluino contributes to @xmath25 at two - loop level , it is also upper bounded by the naturalness @xcite ( however , the direct lhc searches have pushed the gluino up to tev scale @xcite while the recent atlas z - peaked excess may indicate a gluino around 800 gev @xcite ) .",
    "so to test susy naturalness , the crucial task is to search for light stops or higgsinos .",
    "the search strategy for the pair productions of these nearly degenerate higgsinos has been recently studied @xcite . during the lhc run-1 ,",
    "the atlas and cms collaborations have performed the extensive searches for the stops through the gluino - mediated stop production @xcite or the direct stop pair production @xcite . meanwhile , many theoretical studies that aim for improving the lhc sensitivity to a light stop have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the current lhc constraints indicate a stop mass bound of hundreds of gev @xcite , however , those results are affected by the stop polarization states and branching ratios .",
    "the constraints on the right - handed stop from the lhc run-1 direct searches @xcite are usually weakened by the branching ratio suppression , which can still be as light as 230 gev in some compressed region @xcite .",
    "if the stop mass is heavier than about 450 gev , it is allowed in most parameter space .",
    "so in our work , we require the stop mass be heavier than 450 gev @xcite .",
    "usually , the stop pair production provides the most sensitive way to search for the stop at the lhc .",
    "however , the stop can also participate in the electroweak interaction processes .",
    "the determination of the electroweak properties of the stop is an essential task for the lhc and future colliders . in this work",
    ", we study the single stop production @xmath4 in the natural susy at the lhc .",
    "the observation of the single stop production will test the electroweak properties of the stop and the naturalness of the supersymmetry . in the following",
    ", we will perform the monte carlo simulations for the single stop production and examine its sensitivity at the lhc .     and @xmath26 productions at the 14 tev lhc for @xmath27 and degenerate higgsinos with mass @xmath28 gev .",
    "the contribution of conjugate process @xmath29 is included.,width=302 ]",
    "at the lhc , the single stop production is induced by the electroweak interaction and proceeds through the following process ( see fig .",
    "[ cx ] for the corresponding feynman diagrams ) : @xmath30 since in natural susy the light higgsinos are nearly degenerate , the decay products of @xmath31 will carry small energies and , hence , are too soft to be observed in the detector .",
    "thus , the associated production of @xmath26 can be identified as @xmath32 , which provides a distinctive signature at the lhc .    in fig .",
    "[ cx ] , we show the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) cross sections of the stop pair and the single stop productions for @xmath33 gev at 14 tev lhc by using the packages @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "the renormalization and factorization scales are taken as the half average of the final states masses .",
    "in the calculations of @xmath26 , we use the lo and nlo parton densities given by cteq6l1 and cteq6 m with five active flavors @xcite . the contribution of the conjugate process @xmath29 is included . except for the higgsino mass parameter @xmath15 and right - handed stop soft mass @xmath34 , we assume other soft supersymmetric masses at 1 tev , and use the packages @xcite and @xcite to calculate masses , couplings and branching ratios of the sparticles . since the cross section of single stop production is not sensitive to @xmath35 , we take @xmath27 for simplicity .",
    "we find that the single stop cross section can still reach about 200 fb when @xmath36 gev .",
    "the nlo @xmath37-factor of the process @xmath38 ranges from 1.25 to 1.33 .",
    "when the stop becomes heavy , the single stop production cross section will decrease , but slower than the pair production , due to the kinematics .",
    "next , we investigate the lhc observability of the single stop signatures with the sequent decays @xmath39 and @xmath40 : @xmath41 for the decay @xmath42 , the sm backgrounds to the signal @xmath43 are from the semi- and full - hadronic @xmath44 events @xcite , where the undetected lepton and the limited jet energy resolution will lead to the relatively large missing transverse energy .",
    "the processes @xmath45 and @xmath46 can fake the signal when one of those light - flavor jets are mis - tagged as a @xmath47-jet . also , the single top can mimic our signal when the lepton from the @xmath48 boson decay is missed at the detector . while @xmath49 backgrounds are not considered in our simulations due to their small missing energy or cross sections compared to the above backgrounds .",
    "distribution of the top quark in the channel @xmath42 for @xmath33 gev at 14 tev lhc.,width=340 ]    in fig .",
    "[ top - pt ] , we present the parton - level @xmath50 distribution of the top quark in the channel @xmath42 for @xmath33 gev at 14 tev lhc . it can be seen that , with the increase of stop mass , the top quark produced from stop decay is boosted and has larger @xmath50 .",
    "so , in the analysis of @xmath42 channel , we respectively adopt @xcite and normal hadronic top reconstruction methods for each sample to identify the top quark in the final states and present our results with the best one .",
    "the detailed analysis strategies are the followings :    * events with any isolated leptons are rejected ; * * method-1 * : we use cambridge - aachen ( ca ) algorithms   @xcite in  @xcite to cluster the jets with @xmath51 to obtain the _ top - jet _ candidates .",
    "each candidate must have the top quark substructure required by the .",
    "the @xmath47-tagging is also imposed in the _ top - jet _ reconstruction .",
    "other energy deposits outside the _ top - jet _ are further reconstructed as the normal jets by using anti-@xmath52 algorithm with @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "the top window used in our analysis is @xmath54 gev .",
    "while the @xmath48 window is taken as the default value in ; * * method-2 * : in normal hadronic top quark reconstruction , a pair of jets is selected with the invariant mass @xmath55 gev and the smallest @xmath56 .",
    "a third jet closest to this di - jet system is used to constitute the top quark candidate . among these three jets ,",
    "at least one @xmath47-jet and @xmath57 is required .",
    "the anti-@xmath52 algorithm is used for jet clustering with @xmath53 ; * we keep the events with the exact one reconstructed top quark and require 150 gev @xmath58 200 gev ; * the extra leading jet @xmath59 outside the reconstructed top quark object is vetoed if @xmath60 gev and @xmath61 ; * we define the signal regions according to @xmath62 cuts : ( 200 , 100 ) , ( 250 , 150 ) , ( 300 , 200 ) , ( 350 , 250 ) for method-1 , and @xmath63 cuts : ( 200 , 50 ) , ( 250 , 50 ) , ( 300 , 100 ) , ( 350 , 100 ) gev for method-2 .    for the decay @xmath8 , the sm backgrounds to the signal @xmath64 are dominated by the processes @xmath45 and @xmath46 when the light - flavor jets are mis - identified as @xmath47-jets @xcite .",
    "the @xmath44 events become the sub - leading backgrounds due to their large multiplicity .",
    "the signal events are selected to satisfy the following criteria :    * events with any isolated leptons are rejected ; * we require exact one hard @xmath47-jet in the final states , but allow an additional softer jet with @xmath65 gev and @xmath66 . since the hardness of @xmath47-jet from stop decay depends on the mass splitting between @xmath3 and @xmath67 , we define three signal regions for each sample according to @xmath68 cuts : ( 100 , 70 ) , ( 150 , 100 ) and ( 250 , 200 ) gev .",
    "finally , we use the most sensitive signal region ( with the highest @xmath69 ) for each decay mode and show our results in fig .",
    "[ ss - top ] and fig .",
    "[ ss - bottom ] , respectively . in our study",
    ", we omitted the qcd multijet backgrounds , whose correct treatment needs the experimental data - driven methods and hence depends on the realistic detector environments of the 14 tev lhc . as discussed in @xcite , the requirements of high @xmath70 and large @xmath2 with a seperation @xmath71 can usually be expected to greatly reduce the fake contamination from the qcd backgrounds and allow for a good signal selection efficiency .",
    "the parton level signal and background events are generated with @xcite , where @xmath72 is matched up to 3 jets by using mlm matching scheme @xcite and setting @xmath73 gev .",
    "for the value of @xmath74 in matching , we take it to @xmath75 @xcite in our simulation .",
    "we perform parton shower and fast detector simulations with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume the @xmath47-jet tagging efficiency as 70% @xcite and a misidentification efficiency of @xmath76-jets and light jets as 10% and 0.1% , respectively .",

    "even its exclusion limit for the stop may be not as good as the pair production .",
    "however , the stop can participates in the strong interaction processes but also in the electroweak interaction processes , the determination of the electroweak properties of the stop is an essential task for the lhc and future colliders . in this work",
    "we propose to probe natural susy by using the electroweak single - stop production @xmath4 at the lhc ( here the missing energy is from the nearly degenerate higgsinos ) . by analyzing the decay channels of the stop @xmath42 and @xmath8",
    ", we obtain the obervations : ( 1 ) the decay @xmath8 has a better sensitivity than @xmath42 ; ( 2 ) the parameter region with a higgsino mass 100 gev@xmath9 225 gev and the stop mass @xmath97 620 gev can be covered with @xmath11 and @xmath100 at 14 tev hl - lhc with an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath13 .",

    "<S> light top squarks ( stops ) and light higgsinos are the key features of natural susy , where the higgsinos @xmath0 and @xmath1 are nearly degenerate and act as the missing transverse energy ( @xmath2 ) at the lhc . besides the strong production , the stop can be produced via the electroweak interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the determination of the electroweak properties of the stop is an essential task for the lhc and future colliders . </S>",
    "<S> so in this paper , we investigate the single stop ( @xmath3 ) production @xmath4 in the natural susy at the lhc , which gives the monotop signature @xmath5 from @xmath6 or the monobottom signature @xmath7 from @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> we perform monte carlo simulations for these signatures and obtain the results : ( 1 ) the signal @xmath7 has a better sensitivity than @xmath5 for probing natural susy ; ( 2 ) the parameter region with a higgsino mass 100 gev@xmath9 225 gev and stop mass @xmath10 620 gev , can be probed through the single stop production with @xmath11 and @xmath12 at 14 tev hl - lhc with an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb@xmath13 . </S>"
