    "the modern theory of phase transitions originates from the suggestion of landau that the transition from one state of matter to another must correspond to a spontaneous symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "this idea gives rise to the phenomenological theory of phase transitions which is formulated in terms of the order parameter .",
    "quantum hall effect ( qhe )  @xcite , discovered more than 30 years ago , has posed some awkward questions regarding the original landau approach .",
    "indeed , the state of electrons in qhe might be treated as a phase since the macroscopic observables such as the quantized hall conductivity are not affected by smooth variations of material parameters . still the transitions between different hall plateaus are not related to violation of any underlying symmetry  @xcite .",
    "the puzzle has been successfully resolved by introduction of the concept of topological order  @xcite .",
    "the quasiclassical dynamics of the wave packet propagating in periodic dissipative media turned out to be instrumental for the theoretical understanding of this type of order . in an attempt to explain the anomalous hall effect in a ferromagnet as an intrinsic property of the band structure , karplus and luttinger @xcite pointed out that the position operator in a periodic lattice fails to commute with itself .",
    "as a consequence the standard quasiclassical expression for the group velocity acquires an anomalous term , which is proportional to what is now called berry curvature  @xcite .",
    "when integrated over a brillouin zone of a two - dimensional lattice the berry curvature gives topological invariant known as chern number .",
    "the system possessing a non - zero topological invariant may be called topological matter  @xcite .",
    "observation of the spin hall effect in a class of semiconductors with strong spin - orbit coupling  @xcite has revived an interest to topological phases of matter .",
    "a term topological insulator has been coined to describe a system which behaves like an insulator in the bulk but has conducting surface .",
    "the conduction is due to the presence of the edge states which possess remarkable property of topological protection : electrons traveling along the surface of a topological insulator are protected against back - scattering on impurities .",

    ", width=336 ]    it has been recently realized that topologically non - trivial phases may arise not only in the condensed matter electronic systems but also in photonic structures  @xcite ( see , also , review  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the artificial gauge fields in photonic structures can be realized in a system with periodic variation of dielectric permittivity .",
    "large wavelength and coherence length of photons makes it simpler to realize diverse non - trivial landscapes of photonic nanostructures as compared to the electronic counterparts .",
    "at the same time , magnetic field control of the topological properties in photonic structures is precluded at optical frequencies because of the lack of natural magnetic materials in the optical frequency range ( certain realizations of ferromagnetic photonic crystals for microwave region have been proposed and experimentally realized in ref .  ) .",
    "thus , it would be useful to have a physical system which allows flexible control over topological properties via the external magnetic field and the landscape of periodic potential .",
    "exciton - polaritons , quasi - particles originating due to the strong - light matter coupling between the quantum well excitons and cavity photons  @xcite are good candidates .",
    "exciton - polaritons attract significant interest for the last two decades because of the opportunities they offer for the observation of a wide class of quantum collective phenomena ranging from bec and superfluidity  @xcite to polaritonic lasing @xcite . due to their hybrid light - matter nature , exciton - polaritons",
    "can be controlled with external magnetic field by inducing the zeeman splitting in the excitonic component and structure patterning which forms trapping potential for the photonic component .",
    "various techniques have been proposed for creation of the potential landscapes for polaritons .",
    "they include surface acoustic waves  @xcite , metal deposition  @xcite , patterning of the planar structure and fabrication of arrays of coupled micropillars  @xcite . moreover , polaritonic systems exhibit analog of spin - orbit interaction  @xcite stemming from the splitting between te and tm photonic modes  @xcite .",
    "recently there have been several proposals to realize two - dimensional topological phases of polaritons  @xcite . for this , one needs to identify a system with band structure characterized by bands touching at the point degeneracies such as dirac cones . to induce the spin - orbit coupling one",
    "may rely on the polarization - dependent tunneling  @xcite proven to be useful in the context of polaritonic honeycomb lattice  @xcite .",
    "breaking the time - reversal symmetry of a system by application of the magnetic field opens a gap in the band structure characterized by non - zero chern numbers for the bands below and above the gap .",
    "the boundary between topological phases with different chern numbers must support edge modes which are topologically protected against variations of the material parameters unless the band gap in the bulk of the material is collapsed .",
    "such modes are analogs of the edge states arising on a surface of two - dimensional topological insulators and therefore polaritonic systems can play a useful role of a simulator to study topological order in a well - controlled experimental environment . in this paper we consider in details an example of a system of high experimental relevance where topological phase of exciton - polaritons may be realized : kagome lattice of microcavity pillars connected by tunnel coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model of polaritonic kagome lattice .",
    "we demonstrate the appearance of energy gaps when time - reversal and rotational symmetries are broken by magnetic field and te - tm splitting .",
    "in section iii we study topological properties of the band structure for polaritons in kagome lattice .",
    "section iv is devoted to study of edge modes which arise due to non - trivial topology of polaritonic bands , paying particular attention to their localization and polarization properties .",

    "one of the most striking consequences of the berry phase is a dramatic modification of the quasiclassical equation of motion for electron in a lattice  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the appearance of berry phase has a profound impact on properties of crystalline solids  @xcite . for non - interacting systems",

    "it is enough to study the bands either below or above the gap of interest .",

    "a peculiar feature arising at the chosen set of parameters ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) is that the dispersion of the edge state propagating along the lower boundary in fig .",
