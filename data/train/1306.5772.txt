    "a high - power pbs and hwp attenuate the laser power ( from 4 w to ~20 mw ) to reduce the amount of pairs produced per second ( multi - photon downconversion events harm the bell violation , and the problem is greatly exacerbated by the 1-@xmath68 coincidence window to accommodate the large tes jitter ) .",
    "as the tes detector jitter is also much larger than the interpulse spacing of our pulsed laser ( @xmath69 compared to 8.3 ns ) , we use a bbo pockels cell ( extinction ratio ( er ) @xmath70 ) followed by a standard birefringent polarizer to create 2-@xmath68-long pulse trains at a 25 khz rate ( approximately 240 laser pulses ) .",
    "our type - i phase - matched spontaneous parametric downconversion source @xcite consists of a pair of bibo crystals , cut at @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for the first ( second ) crystal .",
    "each crystal is only 200-@xmath73 m thick to reduce the birefringent walkoff of the two downconversion beams ( ~@xmath74 ) .",
    "we precompensate the temporal walkoff @xcite with a 550-@xmath73 m piece of bbo ( cut at @xmath75 ) , resulting in very high entanglement quality ( an interference visibility @xmath76 , i.e. , how well the @xmath24 and @xmath25 terms interfere in an arbitrary basis ) .",
    "the pump is focused to a 350-@xmath77 radius waist on the crystal , while the downconversion is collected from a 60-@xmath77 waist , which is located near the crystals . to image the downconversion crystal spot onto the collection fiber",
    ", we use a 250-mm focal length plano - convex lens with an 11-mm focal length asphere on each arm of the downconversion .",
    "all lenses are anti - reflection coated . with this setup ,",
    "we see a 90% spatial heralding efficiency .",
    "the basis selection is completed using a standard hwp at 710 nm , with a custom - coated brewster s angle pbs ( er @xmath78 8700:1 , t @xmath79 ) to make the projective measurement .",
    "finally , we use a combination spectral filter , comprised of two interference filters ( see fig .",
    "one of the filters has a lower bandedge at ~700 nm ( this was custom set at the company by heat treating the filter ) , while the other filter has an upper bandedge that can be tuned by tilting the filter .",
    "we then tilt these filters to maximize the heralding efficiency , which will set the upper bandedge to ~720 nm ( the wavelength of the upper edge for the signal photon must be conjugate to the lower edge of the idler photon and vice versa , i.e. @xmath80 ) .",
    "we were thus able to achieve a spectral heralding efficiency ( the heralding efficiency if there is no other loss in the system ) of @xmath27 .",
    "after accounting for all losses , the total heralding efficiency is ~76% from the @xmath24 crystal , and ~69% efficiency from the @xmath25 crystal ( due to birefringent transverse walkoff ) .",
    "however , because the measurements are made at angles near @xmath81 , we estimate the net heralding efficiency to be ~75% .     the combined filter spectrum . the lower bandedge ( at 700 nm ) is set by a fixed filter , while the upper bandedge ( at 720 nm ) is set by a tunable filter .",
    "the upper bandedge is controlled by tilting the tunable filter , and adjusted to maximize the heralding efficiency .",
    "the resultant spectral heralding is @xmath27 . ]",
    "the fluorescence rate ( broadband emission believed to be mostly from the anti - reflection coating on the bibo crystal surfaces ) was measured by pumping the crystal with only an h(v)-polarized pump , and orienting the downconversion photon polarizers to h(v ) as well . by accounting for the extinction ratio of the polarizer",
    ", we can estimate the number of unpolarized broadband ( i.e. , not downconversion ) photons produced from the crystal .",
    "we observed rates ranging from @xmath82 to @xmath83 of the singles counts ( i.e. , if we had 10,000 singles counts per second , measured with v - polarizers when the pump was h - polarized , we would see between 15 - 25 fluorescence counts per second , after h - polarizers ) .",
    "the rate would vary depending on the spot of the crystal , and also increased over time as the coating on the crystal surface started to degrade under exposure to the uv laser .",
    "in addition , we also detected approximately 8 cps of stray photons coupled into the smf , i.e. , even with the pump laser off .",
    "to estimate the error of the bell parameter , we segment our data into 50 partitions by taking every 50th trial ( the first partition is trials 1,51,101 ,  , the second partition is trials 2,52,102 , ... ) .",
    "we calculate the bell parameter @xmath84 for each of the partitions and look at the standard deviation of the 50 bell parameters . to improve the statistical certainty , we estimate @xmath85(@xmath10 ) by including both @xmath61(@xmath10 ) terms and dividing by @xmath60(@xmath86 ) + @xmath60(@xmath87 ) , and similarly for @xmath88(@xmath11 ) .",
    "we then use error propagation to estimate the uncertainty ( i.e. , we divide the standard deviation by @xmath89 since we have 50 segments ) . to increase the confidence of the determined uncertainty",
    ", we also performed the previous analysis using 47,48, ... ,53 partitions .",
    "the end result is @xmath90x@xmath91x@xmath92 , where @xmath93x@xmath35 is the mean of the 7 uncertainties , and @xmath94x@xmath92 is the standard deviation of the 7 uncertainties .",
    "finally , we repeated the previous analysis , except with sequential partitions ( i.e. , the first partition is the first @xmath95 of the data , the second partition is the second @xmath95 of the data ) . here",
    "we see @xmath96x@xmath97x@xmath92 , in close agreement with the non - sequential partitioning .",
    "another potentially more relevant approach to estimating the error for bell tests , is to calculate the probability that a  hacker \" could have guessed the settings well enough to produce a violation .",
    "for example , there is no reason to believe that the statistics of a violation follow a gaussian distribution ( especially when one assumes some sort of hacker trying to fake the bell test ) .",
    "one possible method , which will give a definite upper bound on that probability , is to partition the data into distinct cycles and examine how many of those partitions produced a bell violation .    in our case",
    ", we can make _ up to _ 1086 distinct cycles ( since each measurement setting was used at least 1086 times ) .",
    "we find the optimal number of partitions to use in our case is around 650 partitions , where we see 394 bell violations , and 256 non - violations ( here , we estimate @xmath85(@xmath10 ) by considering only the @xmath98 term , and likewise @xmath88(@xmath11 ) = @xmath99 ) .",
    "then the probability that a hacker could succeed in producing a violation on a given cycle by guessing is 50% ( a hacker does not need to guess every measurement setting correctly , one only needs to distinguish between the @xmath100 measurement setting and the @xmath101 measurement setting , which can be done with a 50% chance ) .",
    "thus , we see that the probability a hacker could have produced _ at least _ the observed 394 violations by guessing is just @xmath102x@xmath103 ( which is a definite upper bound on the probability a hacker guessed the measurement settings ) .    one thing to note about",
    "this approach is that it does nt use all of the available information to determine the probability of a hacker guessing the measurement settings .",
    "for example , a more accurate estimate could be found by asking what the probability is that the hacker could have produced the entire _ distribution _ of the observed 1086 bell parameters ( instead of only asking what is the probability of producing at least the _ number _ of violations we observe ) .",
    "of course , the hacker could produce any distribution with probability @xmath104 , putting a definite lower bound on the probability that a hacker forced the observed violation .",
    "the problem of extracting a relatively small amount of randomness from a larger string has been well studied .",
    "the usual nist - suggested methods , i.e. ,  sha256 \" , perform a complicated series of operations on the original data string , outputting a shorter string with higher entropy per bit .",
    "the output can be considered essentially fully random if the amount of entropy input is at least twice the number of bits output from the extractor @xcite . for our case",
    ", this would result in 8700/2 = 4350 final secret random bits .",
    "the sha randomness extractors are not known to be securequantum - proof \"  in the sense that they do not guarantee that the extractor output is uniform with respect to the side information ( possibly quantum ) held by a potential adversary .",
    "more recent results @xcite , based on work by trevisan @xcite , show that one can achieve efficient quantum - proof extraction of randomness by incorporating an auxiliary random seed ) .",
    "if the seed is itself uniformly random , i.e. , unbiased , then one can extract almost all of the original min - entropy ( 8700 in our case ) of the original data string ( 8x@xmath105 bits for us ) ; specifically , the final secure , secret output string will have @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the error between the actual output random string and a truly uniform random string . conservatively choosing @xmath108 , we could extract 8580 bits .",
    "however , the required ( uniform ) seed length to achieve this is @xmath109x@xmath110^{3 } ) \\approx 26000 $ ] .",
    "although we can generate such a seed from the same qrng used for selecting the measurement settings in our bell test , the relative seed overhead cost will be better reduced by running on a larger initial data string .",
    "note that this analysis does not attempt to take finite statistics into account , which will be the topic of future studies .",
    "there are two simple super - quantum models that are easy to consider .",
    "the first model is one in which the maximum chsh bell parameter is greater than @xmath56 . in this case ,",
    "our measured chsh bell parameter of @xmath54 sets the upper limit of the allowable super - quantum value to 2.861 ( at @xmath111 ) .",
    "the other case to consider would be an  on / off \" model , where the super - quantum model ( which is assumed to saturate the bell violation to @xmath112 ) only exists a percentage of the time ; here , we find that such a super - quantum model can only be  on \" for 2.8% of the time ( at @xmath111 ) .",
    "while more complex models ( and analysis of these models ) can exist , the results from our experiment can begin to set bounds on the strength of these super - quantum models .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the two primary loopholes of the previous reported experimental results @xcite ( outside of the causal loophole ) that require fair - sampling assumptions .",
    "while it may be possible to look at correlations in the whole data set ( rather than just by looking at events ) to still close the detection loophole @xcite , the results presented in the paper , and in the follow up paper @xcite , do not justify the claim that the paper is free of fair - sampling assumptions .",
    "the first issue , called the coincidence - time loophole , was discovered by j .- a .",
    "larsson and r. d. gill in @xcite , and brought to our attention by manny knill @xcite .",
    "larsson and gill discuss the loophole from the perspective of a measurement - setting - dependent detector ; here we will describe it from the perspective of an adversary trying to force a bell violation using only non - entangled photons , and without using the timing loophole .",
    "the goal is to describe a classical source ( the hidden - variable model ) that nevertheless violates the ch inequality .",
    "we exploit the fact that a coincidence count in @xcite is not defined by a system clock ( for example , a laser pulse ) , and instead is defined with respect to the detection event itself .",
    "consider the following hidden - variable model : + at time @xmath113 , the source emits ( to alice ) a photon that is instructed with a hidden - variable : 0 if the analysis setting is @xmath10 , 1 if @xmath12 .",
    "+ at time @xmath114 , the source emits ( to bob ) a photon with instructions : 0 if @xmath13 , 1 if @xmath11 .",
    "+ at time @xmath115 , the source emits ( to alice ) a photon with instructions : 0 if @xmath12 , 1 if @xmath10 .",
    "+ at time @xmath116 , the source emits ( to bob ) a photon with instructions : 0 if @xmath11 , 1 if @xmath13 .",
    "+ now , if we have @xmath60 trials where the previous model is used , and we choose a coincidence window ( @xmath117 ) of radius @xmath118 , we will detect the following counts ( see fig .",
    "s2a ) : + @xmath119 + @xmath120 + @xmath121 + @xmath122 + @xmath123 + @xmath124 .",
    "+   here we have assumed that every photon is detected , which could easily be realized in practice by simply using fairly bright pulses instead of single photons .",
    "the ch inequality , @xmath125 , then gives @xmath126 .",
    "not only does this violate the inequality , it even exceeds the maximal violation ( @xmath127 ) allowed by quantum mechanics !",
    "( obviously we could also tune the lhv model to exactly mimic the quantum mechanical predictions . )",
    "one way that this loophole can be avoided is to no longer define coincidence counts with a window around a detection event , but instead with a window around some system clock ( such as a laser pulse ; see fig .",
    "s2b ) . a continuous pair - production source",
    "could then circumvent this loophole by partitioning time into segments and defining those segment as trials ( in practice this is a very challenging task , however , as the amount of background counts increases with the size of the coincidence window , which will need to be very large to have the high efficiency necessary to close the detection loophole ) . as long as the coincidence window is not defined around a detection event itself , then this hidden - variable model can not violate a bell inequality , e.g. , the bell violation again becomes a valid proof of the insufficiency of local realism to explain the correlations .    in our own experiment we can not simply use the laser pulses directly to define the coincidence window , because they come at intervals ( 8.33 nanoseconds ) much less than the timing jitter of the tes detectors ( 500 ns ) .",
    "therefore , we use an additional pockel cell and polarizer to reduce the effective pulse rate of the laser to only 25 khz , so that the detector jitter is now much less than the inter - trial spacing ( @xmath128 ) .",
    "note that we choose to define an event as 240 sequential pulses .",
    "this number is chosen to minimize the ratio of noise counts to entangled photon counts ; that is , we want to include more laser pulses to reduce the effect of detection of stray photons , but we want to limit the number of laser pulses to reduce the number of  accidental \" coincidence counts from two separate downconversion events .",
    "we use 240 laser pulses as a compromise between the two effects .",
    "display of the coincidence - time loophole . in diagram",
    "a , the coincidence window ( green arrow ) is defined with respect to a detection event , which allows the coincidence counts to be manipulated . in this case , there will be no @xmath129 coincidence counts , but every other coincidence count will still exist , allowing for a violation of a ch bell inequality . in diagram b , the coincidence window is defined with respect a system clock ( blue line ) , instead of a detection event . here , the coincidence counts will not be able to be manipulated by a potential eavesdropper , and thus the source will either see coincidence counts in all channels ( solid green arrow ) , or only @xmath130 coincidence counts ( dashed green arrow ) ; in either case , there will be no bell violation . ]    the second weakness present in the system in @xcite is related to the fair - sampling assumption .",
    "the measurements were made cyclically instead of randomly choosing the order of the analysis settings .",
    "the reason why this is an issue can be seen in the case of a temporal - drift in laser power ( either increasing or decreasing over time ) , or a drift in detector efficiency or latency , so that each measurement setting sees a different number of pairs produced during a count duration , i.e. , the entanglement source is not fairly sampling over all of the measurement settings .",
    "as discussed below , in principle such drift can strongly affect the bell parameter because some of the measurements are only added negatively to the ch bell parameter , while some measurements add positively .",
    "consider attempting a ch violation with the mixed state @xmath131 , which has no entanglement and therefore should not produce a bell violation .",
    "for this example , we will use the settings ( the optimal settings if the source were maximally entangled ) of @xmath132 . now consider making the measurements in a set order , for example : @xmath133 .",
    "if the laser power exponentially decays to @xmath134 of the total power over the course of the entire measurement cycle , then we would see @xmath135 ( eq .",
    "3 ) , corresponding to a large violation of the ch inequality .",
    "thus , one must make an additional assumption that that the production / detection rates are not temporally varying , and therefore the ordering of the measurements does not matter , i.e. , one must assume the source is fairly sampled .",
    "if the measurement settings are chosen based on a set of random numbers instead , as in our experiment , then these drifts affect each measurement setting equally likely over the course of many measurements . in this case , any drift will tend to decrease the bell violation , or at best , leave it unaffected .    as a second ,",
    "more realistic example , consider attempting a ch violation with the state @xmath136 , in a system that only has an average detection efficiency of @xmath137 .",
    "now suppose the background counts in this system are actually too high to allow for a ch violation ( background count rate is @xmath138 of the singles rate ) .",
    "for this example , we will also the settings : @xmath139 .",
    "again , consider always making the measurement in a set order , in this case : @xmath140 . here ,",
    "if the laser power exponentially decays to @xmath141 of the initial power over the course of a full measurement cycle , then we would see @xmath142 , corresponding to the observed violation of the ch inequality , despite the noise being too high to legitimately have such a violation .",
    "while the previous two examples show how an intensity drift could lead to a violation , the recent discussion found in @xcite shows that such drift , which _ does _ exist in the system described in @xcite , is nevertheless not enough to cause a false violation .",
    "however , there are still other models , such as a cyclic detector latency ( which leads to varying coincidences without effecting the singles , and therefore would not be refuted by the measurements in @xcite ) could still lead to a false violation of a bell inequality .",
    "in addition , the very low number of basis choice ( five total cycles ) puts a bound on the amount of confidence in any violation . for example , if nature ( or a hacker ) were to try to guess the settings and force a violation , then they have a 50% of succeeding for each cycle .",
    "thus , a hacker could have forced a violation for each cycle with a probability of @xmath143 , the equivalent of a 2.2-@xmath32 violation .",
    "in this section , we will discuss a hidden - variable model that takes advantage of the detection - loophole , as well as a discussion on how non - maximally entangled states reduce the efficiency required to close this loophole .",
    "of course , since the ch inequality has no fair - sampling assumption , we will base this discussion on the chsh inequality ( where we can have a fair - sampling assumption ) .",
    "for each pair in a standard chsh bell inequality s experimental ensemble , either measurement @xmath10 or @xmath12 is made on particle @xmath144 and similarly @xmath11 or @xmath13 on particle @xmath84 .",
    "the randomly chosen , relativistically simultaneous measurements result in four correlation factors @xmath145 , where @xmath146 indicates perfect correlation ( the polarizations are found to be the same ) , @xmath147 indicates perfect anti - correlation ( the polarization are always found to be orthogonal ) , and values between -1 and + 1 indicate a linear mix of the two .",
    "bell proved that all local realistic experimental outcomes obey the following inequality : @xmath148 quantum mechanics instead predicts that maximally entangled states can reach a value of @xmath149 . in practice , each of the @xmath145 values can not be measured directly , but are instead inferred from a series of coincidence counts for each of the four terms above , as well as singles counts for each detector s two measurement settings . perhaps surprisingly , the singles counts are crucial to a loophole - free violation of local realism . to understand why , consider inventing a local realistic explanation for the following bell test results :      these are the average experimental results for ideal detectors , the maximally entangled state hh+vv , optimal polarizer angles of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , and an ensemble of 4000 entangled pairs randomly measured in each of four configurations .",
    "the best local realistic model for these results instructs some particle pairs to always be detected ( denoted by @xmath153 , where the measurements listed in curly braces indicate instructions to be detected by that measurement ) and some particle pairs to be detected only by a subset of all possible measurements , in the following scheme : + 4 x 73 pairs : @xmath153 , + 4 x 177 pairs : @xmath154 , + 4 x 177 pairs : @xmath155 , + 4 x 177 pairs : @xmath87 , + 4 x 177 pairs : @xmath156 , + 4 x 73 pairs : @xmath12 , + 4 x 73 pairs : @xmath13 , + which results in the following coincidence and singles count totals :      the local realistic model simply can not combine multiple - basis correlations into a single set of instructions ; as a result any local realistic model that explains the coincidence counts necessarily generates too many singles counts .",
    "it is precisely this type of multiple - basis correlation that makes quantum mechanical entanglement nonclassical .",
    "these results are now perfectly explained by the following local realistic model : + 4 x 49 pairs : @xmath153 , + 4 x 119 pairs : @xmath154 , + 4 x 119 pairs : @xmath155 , + 4 x 119 pairs : @xmath87 , + 4 x 119 pairs : @xmath159 , + 4 x 123 pairs : @xmath12 , + 4 x 123 pairs : @xmath13 , + 4 x 4 pairs : @xmath10 , + 4 x 4 pairs : @xmath11 , + to try to disprove this type of local realistic model , even with inefficient detectors , it is necessary to increase the coincidence - to - singles ratio , even at the expense of the absolute bell violation ( the ratio of the first three terms to the fourth in eq .",
    "this can be accomplished with a nonmaximally entangled state , e.g. , @xmath160 .    for @xmath161 ,",
    "the optimal bell measurement angles all collapse towards the horizontal axis : @xmath162 , and @xmath163 , where @xmath164 for @xmath165 .",
    "this collapse increases the coincidence - to - singles ratio , slightly increases the degree of positive correlation in the first three bell terms , and dramatically decreases the degree of anticorrelation in the final bell term ( because the overlap between @xmath12 and @xmath13 grows quickly ) . while the value of @xmath61 decreases , the experiment becomes more robust against inefficient detectors .",
    "note that all of the polarizer angles become close to horizontal as @xmath166 , which reduces all coincidence and singles counts . as a result ,",
    "nonmaximally entangled states measured in this configuration become much more sensitive to noise , as shown in the eberhard paper @xcite .",
    "physically , the problem is that the noise is unpolarized , so that the analysis settings can not be adjusted to reduce / eliminate it , as they can for the singles counts arising from a non - maximally entangled state .",

    "<S> these values are on par with the highest reported violations of bell s inequality ever reported @xcite , but unlike all previously reported results include _ no accidental subtraction or post - processing of any kind_. as a result , this source provides not only the best experimental evidence to date that local realistic theories are not viable , but also provides the best test so far of the _ upper limits _ for quantum correlations ; some super - quantum theories @xcite actually predict that the upper limit for the bell inequality can be _ greater _ than @xmath56 , a prediction constrained by the results reported here @xcite .    the high entanglement quality , along with the detection - loophole - free capability , offers interesting possibilities for applications , notably for  device - independent \" quantum information processing . </S>",
    "<S> here the goal is to implement a certain protocol , and to guarantee its security , without relying on assumptions about the internal functioning of the devices used in the protocol . </S>",

    "<S> one prominent example is device - independent randomness expansion ( dire ) @xcite . by performing local measurements on entangled particles , and observing nonlocal correlations between the outcomes of these measurements , it is possible to certify the presence of genuine randomness in the data in a device - independent way . </S>",
    "<S> dire was recently demonstrated in a proof - of - principle experiment using entangled atoms located in two traps separated by one meter @xcite ; however , the resulting 42 random bits required a month of data collection ! here we show that our setup can be used to implement dire much more efficiently . the intrinsic randomness of the quantum statistics can be quantified as follows . </S>",

    "<S> , this leads to a bound on the min - entropy per bit of the output data , @xmath58 . </S>",

    "<S> we acquire 111,259,682 data points for 3 hours of data acquisition . </S>",
    "<S> the average ch violation of @xmath33x@xmath62 gives a min - entropy of @xmath63x@xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , we expect ~8700 bits of private randomness , of which one could securely extract at least 4350 bits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resultant rate ( 0.4 bits / s ) improves by more than 4 orders of magnitude over the bit rate achieved in @xcite ( @xmath64x@xmath62 bits / s ) . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that efficient and practical dire can be implemented with photonic systems .    </S>",
    "<S> we have presented a new entangled photon pair creation , collection , and detection apparatus , where the high system efficiency allowed us to truly violate a ch bell inequality with no fair - sampling assumption ( but still critically relying on the no - signaling assumption that leaves the causality loophole open ) . because photonic entanglement is particularly amenable to the types of fast </S>",
    "<S> , random measurement and distributed detection needed to close the locality loophole , this experiment ( together with efforts by other groups @xcite ) represents the penultimate step towards a completely loophole - free test of bell s inequality , and advanced device - independent quantum communication applications ; here we demonstrated production of provably secure randomness at unprecedented rates . </S>",
