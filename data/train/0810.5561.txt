    "while most astrophysical objects require many parameters in order to be fully described , black holes are unique in that only three parameters suffice : mass , spin , and charge .",
    "mass and spin describe the black hole s gravitational field and event horizon location .",
    "therefore , black holes provide a rare opportunity for theory and observation to jointly pursue a few quantities to completely describe one of the most exotic kinds of objects in the universe .",
    "+ though modeling of the x - ray spectral energy distribution is somewhat effective in constraining black hole spin ( mcclintock et al . 2006 ) , important constraints on black hole mass exist in the case of high mass x - ray binaries ( hereafter hmxbs ) .",
    "these binaries consist of an o or b type supergiant and a black hole or neutron star .",
    "the most well - studied of these , cygnus x-1 , is thought to consist of a @xmath1 @xmath2 , o9.7iab star and a @xmath3 @xmath2 black hole at a distance of @xmath4 kpc ( zilkowski 2005 ) . while the constraints on the mass of the compact object are tight enough to declare that it is a black hole , they are insufficient to permit precise modeling of the progenitor star s mass . we have commissioned a polarimeter on the hale 5-m telescope at palomar observatory in california to provide an independent method for determining black hole mass .",
    "this polarimeter has the potential to constrain the mass of the cygnus x-1 black hole to a few solar masses",
    "a wealth of radial velocity data exists for cygnus x-1 ( gies et al . 2003 ) and other hmxbs .",
    "however , in the same way that precise masses are elusive for non - transiting extrasolar planets , determination of precise black hole mass is hindered by unknown orbital inclination .",
    "this is evidenced by the mass function , which is the end product of radial velocity observations . for cygnus x-1 , gies et al .",
    "( 2003 ) quote the following value for the mass function :    @xmath5    here , @xmath6 is the mass of the black hole , @xmath7 is the mass of the visible binary component , @xmath8 is the system inclination , and @xmath9 is the mass ratio of the visible component to the black hole .",
    "thus , an observational technique that constrains orbital inclination can take advantage of radial velocity data and offer an estimate of black hole mass .",
    "+ since system polarization is a geometric effect , the polarization of an hmxb system can be used to determine geometric information about the system , such as orbital inclination .",
    "the effective temperature of the supergiant in an hmxb is @xmath10 30,000 k , which is hot enough to ionize photospheric hydrogen .",
    "this generates a high density of free electrons that thomson - scatter emitted light from the supergiant .",
    "while net linear polarization from a spherical cloud of free electrons is zero , asymmetry in the system causes net polarization ( brown & mclean 1977 )",
    ". the tidal effects of the black hole cause such an asymmetry in the circumbinary envelope , and the orbital modulation of polarization is the key to determining orbital inclination . for instance , consider a face - on hmxb with zero eccentricity and an optically thin circumbinary envelope ( figure [ 2myfiga]a ) .",
    "the total amount of observed , polarized light is independent of orbital phase , and the degree of polarization is therefore constant .",
    "however , the angle of net polarization , which is perpendicular to the scattering plane , rotates as the binary progresses in its orbit .",
    "+    in contrast , for a nearly edge - on geometry the degree of polarization varies significantly throughout the orbit , while the angle of net polarization is roughly constant ( figure [ 2myfiga]b ) .",
    "therefore , the modulation of the degree and angle of net polarization is a unique measure of orbital inclination for synchronously rotating hmxbs .",
    "combining equations 1 and 2 from friend & cassinelli ( 1986 ) and equation 2 from brown et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , the polarization of an optically thin , axisymmetric envelope due to thomson scattering is    @xmath11    here , @xmath12 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath13 is the cosine of the polar angle , the electron number density as a function of radial coordinate @xmath14 is @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a scaling constant , stellar radius is @xmath17 , system inclination is @xmath8 , and orbital phase in radians is @xmath18 .",
    "two polarization periods occur per orbital period because of the @xmath19 term . +",
    "this technique has been utilized by a few groups ( kemp et al .",
    "1979 ; dolan & tapia 1989 ; wolinski et al .",
    "1996 ) , and cygnus x-1 has been found to have variable polarization of order @xmath20 with respect to its unpolarized flux . however , measurement precision from the above groups is of order one part in @xmath21 .",
    "the derived inclination estimates were questioned by the community on the grounds that significant underestimation of error occurred because of limited measurement precision ( milgrom 1979 ; aspin et al .",
    "measuring inclination to @xmath22 requires polarimetric precision of one part in @xmath23 to one part in @xmath24 , depending on system inclination @xcite .",
    "this requires at least @xmath25 to @xmath26 detected photons , which necessitates the use of large telescopes . since our system combines a high precision instrument with a 5-m telescope , we aim to measure the polarimetric variability of cygnus x-1 to better than one part in @xmath21 . +",
    "polarimeters require the following fundamental components : a polarization modulator , analyzer , detector , and demodulator .",
    "the modulator induces a known , periodic characteristic to the unknown polarization of the input beam .",
    "the analyzer converts modulation in polarization to modulation in the beam s intensity , since most detectors are sensitive to intensity and not polarization .",
    "finally , the demodulator extracts the component of the detector s output that varies at the known frequency of the modulator to reject noise",
    ". see figure [ 2myfigb ] for a block diagram , figure [ 2myfigc ] for a ray trace diagram , and figure [ 2myfigz ] for photographs of the instrument . +    traditionally , the modulator is a rotating halfwave plate that rotates the linear polarization of the incident beam .",
    "the highest modulation frequency attainable with this component is of order 100 hz , which is not fast enough to freeze out atmospheric turbulence or to mitigate electronic @xmath27 noise .",
    "additionally , spatial inhomogeneity in both the retardance and cleanliness of the plate can introduce spurious signals , because the beam samples different sections of the halfwave plate at different times . the polarization goal for our instrument , polish",
    "( polarimeter for inclination studies of high mass x - ray binaries / hot jupiters ) , is one part per million on bright , unpolarized stars , which necessitates the use of a photoelastic modulator ( hereafter pem , kemp 1969 ) .",
    "+ a pem is a bar of optical materials ( fused silica for use in optical light ) in which a resonant acoustic signal at a frequency of tens of kilohertz is induced .",
    "the stress - birefringent property of the silica causes time - varying , sinusoidal retardance of the component of polarization oriented at @xmath28 with respect to the compression / extension axis , while the polarization components at @xmath29 and @xmath30 experience no retardance .",
    "that is , a pem at @xmath31 with respect to the stokes @xmath32 axis will cause retardance to the @xmath33 stokes parameter but not to the @xmath34 parameter . since peak retardance is a function of the amplitude of the acoustic signal",
    ", both peak retardance and wavelength of peak retardance can be easily modified .",
    "we set the retardance amplitude to @xmath35 waves at 500 nm wavelength to give uniform pem efficiency for both low and high linear polarizations .",
    "this also causes linear polarization to be directly proportional to the amplitude of the ac signal divided by the mean dc signal , which is derived in appendix a. + the high frequency pem modulation strongly reduces both atmospheric turbulence and electronic @xmath27 noise .",
    "additionally , the beam always samples the same optical path during the modulation , because the strain on the modulator element is only of order ten parts per million ( kemp 1969 ) .",
    "operationally , a pem is the opposite of a rotating halfwave plate : while the plate has a constant retardance and time - variable fast axis orientation , a pem has constant fast axis orientation but time - variable retardance .",
    "since the absolute value of the pem s retardance determines the polarization of the beam at any instant , compression and extension of the fused silica bar affect the beam identically .",
    "therefore , linear polarization is modulated at twice the frequency of the pem modulation .",
    "we use the i / fs50 pem and pem100 controller from hinds instruments , inc .",
    "the modulation frequency of this pem is 50 khz , and modulation of linearly polarized light occurs at 100 khz .",
    "+ directly downstream from the pem is a 95r/5 t beamsplitter at @xmath36 incidence that allows @xmath37 of the stellar flux to fall on a xybion ccd camera for on - axis guiding , while the remaining @xmath38 is reflected into a wollaston prism toward the detectors .",
    "the beamsplitter has a 50-mm diameter , fused silica substrate from edmund optics with a custom 400 to 700 nm coating from opticorp , inc .",
    "the surface accuracy on the substrate is one - tenth of a wavelength .",
    "+ we utilize a two - wedge , calcite wollaston prism from karl lambrecht , inc .",
    ", as the analyzer .",
    "this prism separates each component of a single stokes parameter into two beams .",
    "that is , the @xmath39 ( or @xmath40 ) component is split into one beam , and the @xmath41 ( or @xmath42 ) component is in the other beam . both beams have equal deviation of @xmath43 from the optical axis , which allows the optical layout to be symmetric with respect to the optical axis .",
    "a two - wedge prism is used because the larger beam deviation of a three - wedge design would cause the instrument package to be larger than necessary .",
    "the surfaces of the wollaston prism have an antireflection coating in the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm , and the transmission in @xmath44 band is @xmath45 per surface . by injecting light through a linear polarizer with known fast axis orientation and then through the wollaston prism , we find that the left beam seen from the detectors is vertically polarized ( @xmath41 when projected onto the sky for a cassegrain ring angle of @xmath29 ) .",
    "the right beam is horizontally polarized ( @xmath39 at @xmath29 ring angle ) .",
    "+ each wollaston beam then impinges on an @xmath46 , mgf@xmath47 antireflection - coated field lens from melles griot .",
    "these lenses image the telescope secondary mirror onto the detectors , and they ensure starlight is uniformly spread over the detector active area even in the presence of image wander .",
    "field stops are located in the image plane , after the field lenses , but these are not currently used because contamination of stellar polarization from the sky field is not significant .",
    "the beams reach the detectors with a diameter of @xmath48 mm , which underfills all detectors . + since cygnus x-1 has @xmath44 magnitude @xmath49 , but the polarization standard stars observed can be as bright as @xmath50 , polish has two interchangeable pairs of detectors .",
    "stars fainter than @xmath51 are detected at a higher signal to noise ratio with the pair of hamamatsu h9307 - 04 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) , while objects brighter than this will destroy the pmts .",
    "brighter stars are observed with custom - made advanced photonix sd197 - 70 - 72 - 661 ( red enhanced ) and sd197 - 70 - 74 - 661 ( blue enhanced ) avalanche photodiode modules ( apds ) .",
    "the high quantum efficiency of apds is desirable on bright stars to minimize photon shot noise , while the low dark current of pmts is desirable on fainter stars to minimize detector noise .",
    "+ the detectors are not downstream from spectral filters , and they are integrated light detectors in both spatial and spectral senses .",
    "spatial resolution is unnecessary , as the angular size of the cygnus x-1 system is much smaller than the atmospheric seeing disk .",
    "spectral resolution , while desirable , would seriously degrade the precision attainable with this instrument .",
    "such resolution must be left for future generations of polish . neglecting detector quantum efficiency ,",

    "the fwhm of the bandpass for the blue enhanced apd is about 500 nm ( 350 to 850 nm ) , which corresponds to broadband @xmath84 light . the red module operates with an observed gain of @xmath85 , and the blue module operates at a quoted gain of @xmath86 .",

    "+    the demodulator picks out the component of the detected signal that varies at the reference frequency and ideally rejects signals at all other frequencies .",
    "the demodulator can either be software or hardware ; polish makes use of one stanford research sr830 digital , dual - phase lock - in amplifier for each detector .",
    "the pem controller sends a square wave reference signal to the lock - in amplifiers at twice the frequency of the pem modulation , and each lock - in amplifier recovers @xmath94 ( in phase with reference signal ) and @xmath95 ( @xmath30 out of phase with the reference signal ) components of the detector signal .",
    "together , @xmath94 and @xmath95 determine amplitude @xmath17 and phase @xmath96 according to the following :    @xmath97    @xmath98    the lock - in amplifiers record the rms components of the in - phase and quadrature phase signals , so multiplication by a factor of @xmath99 is necessary to determine the amplitude of the ac signal .",
    "the notation of the argument of the arctangent is meant to account for the signs of @xmath94 and @xmath95 when determining phase .",
    "+ signal phase allows direct measurement of the sign of each stokes parameter ( e.g. , @xmath39 versus @xmath41 ) .",
    "this is important , because insensitivity to sign would preclude direct measurement of more than @xmath30 of rotation of the cygnus x-1 system .",
    "both ac and dc signals from the detector must be recorded to measure polarization ( appendix a ) .",
    "the ac signals are recorded by the lock - in amplifiers , and each detector s dc signal is recorded by a separate hp 34401a digital voltmeter . to reject 60 hz noise and its harmonics , each dc reading by the voltmeters consists of an integration over 10 power line cycles .",
    "thus , the voltmeters record data at 6 hz .",
    "the lock - in amplifiers may only sample the ac signal at powers of two in frequency , so we choose to record the ac data at 8 hz .",
    "the discrepancy in sampling rates between ac and dc data is not important , because ac data should be normalized by mean dc data and not in a point - by - point fashion .",
    "+ in order to nyquist sample the ac data , we set the lock - in time constants to 30 ms .",
    "this gives an effective noise bandwidth of enbw @xmath100 hz .",
    "therefore , we sample the ac data @xmath101 times per effective time constant , which satisfies the nyquist criterion and reduces aliasing .",
    "the lock - in amplifiers thus measure the components of the ac signal with frequencies bounded by @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the reference frequency in hz .",
    "the auxiliary dc output of one lock - in amplifier is connected to a chopping motor on the telescope secondary mirror , which allows the secondary mirror to chop north to a sky field for sky subtraction of both ac and dc data .",

    "nightly mean and run - averaged polarizations of most stars are observed at precision levels comparable to planetpol , a similar instrument mounted on the william herschel telescope . + precision achieved on unpolarized stars is of order one part per million , which is up to three orders of magnitude more precise than the combined polarimetric catalog of heiles ( 2000 ) .",

    "the large improvement in polarimetric precision arises from the combination of large telescope aperture , a high - quality polarization modulator , and high frequency modulation .",
