    "the most widely used approach to obtain the ground - state hartree - fock ( hf ) energy and density matrix has been to solve the euler - lagrange equations associated with the minimization of the hartree - fock energy . in 1951 roothaan  @xcite and hall  @xcite proposed the first self - consistent - field ( scf ) method to solve the hartree - fock equations .",
    "however , the method was soon discovered to converge only for well - behaved cases . since then",
    "numerous algorithms have been proposed to modify the scf method to improve its convergence properties , including level - shifting  @xcite , damping  @xcite and direct inversion of the iterative subspace ( diis )  @xcite .",
    "diis is currently the most popular scf algorithm because of its computational efficiency in most cases .",
    "nevertheless , it is not globally convergent , and in many cases it is known to fail even with a good initial guess .",
    "a method is globally convergent when it converges to a local minimum from any initial guess .",
    "level - shifting is globally convergent for a large enough shift parameter  @xcite , but its speed of convergence decreases as the shift parameter increases .",
    "since scf methods do not ensure an energy decrease at each iteration , a potentially more natural approach to solving the hartree - fock problem is to minimize the hartree - fock energy directly as a function of the density matrix using gradient or hessian - based methods . in 1956",
    "mcweeny  @xcite proposed direct - minimization methods  @xcite , but they have not yet found wide applicability either due to their slow convergence or prohibitive cost .",
    "recently , a combination of the monotonic energy decrease property of direct - minimization methods and the speed of scf methods was achieved in the relaxed - constraints algorithms  @xcite and trust - region methods  @xcite which are both globally convergent and efficient . however",
    ", none of these methods can certify that the computed solution is the global minimum .",
    "convex minimization problems possess the attractive property that the existence of a local minimum implies that it is the global minimum .",
    "semidefinite programs ( sdp ) are a class of convex optimization problems in which a linear function of a positive semidefinite matrix is optimized subject to linear constraints . for an @xmath0-electron system the minimization of the ground - state energy as a functional of the two - electron reduced density matrix ( 2-rdm ) subject to @xmath0-representability constraints  @xcite has been expressed as an sdp  @xcite , and the resulting variational 2-rdm method  @xcite in conjunction with large - scale sdp solvers",
    "@xcite has been applied to computing directly the 2-rdms of strongly correlated systems including molecules like polyaromatic hydrocarbons  @xcite and firefly luciferin  @xcite as well as quantum dots  @xcite , quantum phase transitions  @xcite , and one- and two - dimensional spin models  @xcite .",
    "we recently presented two sdp algorithms that yield upper and lower bounds on the ground - state energy from hartree - fock theory . here",
    "we extend these algorithms to treat restricted open - shell hartree - fock ( rohf ) theory . while wave function approaches to hartree - fock theory yield an upper bound to the hartree - fock energy",
    ", we derive a semidefinite relaxation of hartree - fock theory that yields a rigorous lower bound on the hartree - fock energy . in the lower - bound sdp algorithm the idempotency constraint on the one - electron density matrix is relaxed .",
    "we also develop an upper - bound algorithm in which hartree - fock theory is cast as an sdp with a nonconvex constraint on the rank of the matrix variable .",
    "whenever the upper and lower bounds are equal to each other , they provide a certificate of global optimality to the obtained solution .",
    "to illustrate these algorithms , we apply them to computing the symmetry - broken spin - restricted hartree - fock potential energy curves for c2 , cn , cr2 and no2 .",
    "this problem is challenging because there are multiple local minima of different spatial symmetries on the potential energy surfaces .",
    "traditional methods that solve the euler - lagrange equations often converge to minima higher in energy than the global minimum . in principle",
    ", ek - paldus stability analysis can be applied to locate multiple solutions to the euler - lagrange equations , but it can be computationally expensive and it can not determine whether a local solution is also a global solution .",
    "we find that the upper - bound sdp algorithm consistently converges to the lowest energy solutions and that the lower - bound sdp algorithm generates a tight lower bound .",
    "neither the upper- or lower - bound sdp algorithm relies on the quality of the initial guess for the density matrix , and in all sdp calculations presented here the initial density matrix is equated to a matrix whose elements are formed by a random number generator .",
    "when the upper and lower bounds are equal , the sdp algorithms provide a certificate of global optimality for the hartree - fock solution .",
    "the energetically degenerate symmetry - broken solutions are important because they can be combined convexly into an ensemble density matrix that not only has the desired molecular symmetry but yields a size - consistent energy .",
    "all of the hartree - fock solutions that we obtain using the sdp approach are restricted , i.e. @xmath1 has exactly the correct expectation value . in many strongly correlated cases , as shown in section  [ sec : apps ] , employing the symmetry - broken hartree - fock wave function as a reference in single - reference correlation methods like coupled cluster singles - doubles improves the correlated solution .",
    "the quantity that we have been discussing as the density matrix can be more precisely called the one - particle reduced density matrix ( 1-rdm ) , which we denote as @xmath2 . the hartree - fock problem for an @xmath0-electron system in an orthonormal basis of rank @xmath3 is typically expressed as the following minimization problem over the set of hermitian matrices ( @xmath4 )    @xmath5    the self - consistent - field hartree - fock method for an @xmath0-electron system iteratively solves a system of euler - lagrange equations for a stationary point .",
    "the stationary point yields a ground - state hartree - fock energy and a set of @xmath0 occupied orbitals .",
    "the computed hartree - fock energy is not guaranteed to be the global - energy minimum . from the perspective of reduced density matrices ( rdms )  @xcite",
    ", we can understand the self - consistent - field method as iteratively checking extreme points of the set of 1-rdms for satisfaction of the euler - lagrange equations where each extreme point corresponds to a 1-rdm with a slater - determinant preimage  @xcite .",
    "the set of extreme 1-rdms ( those with an @xmath0-electron slater determinant as a preimage ) can be characterized by the idempotency constraint in eq .",
    "( [ idem ] ) .",
    "the optimization of the hartree - fock energy over the set of extreme 1-rdms can be replaced without approximation by an optimization over the larger ( and convex ) set of @xmath0-representable 1-rdms ( those with any @xmath0-electron wave function as a preimage )  @xcite : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the following quadratic function of the 1-rdm : @xmath8 the one - electron hamiltonian operator @xmath9 contains the kinetic energy operator and electron - nuclei potential , @xmath10 represents the electron - electron repulsion integrals , and the indices @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 denote the orbitals in the one - electron basis set of rank @xmath3 .",

    "the reduced - density - matrix formulation of hartree - fock theory can be recast as a convex semidefinite program by embedding the quadratic product of 1-rdms in @xmath7 in a higher dimensional ( two - electron ) matrix @xmath20 . rewriting @xmath7 as a linear functional of @xmath21 @xmath22 we can relax the non - convex hartree - fock optimization to a convex semidefinite program :",
    "@xmath23 the solution of this sdp relaxation yields a lower bound to the hartree - fock energy .",
    "because the constraints on the matrix @xmath21 are minimal , this convex sdp formulation will typically yield energies that are significantly below the hartree - fock energy . to reproduce hartree - fock , further constraints on @xmath21",
    "are required .",
    "two separate sets of additional conditions on the matrix @xmath21 that yield upper and lower bounds on the hartree - fock energy , respectively , will be considered .",
    "the first set of constraints , yielding the upper bound , consists of a single rank constraint @xmath24 the @xmath20 matrix with its rank - one constraint and the contraction constraint in eq .",
    "( [ eq : conm ] ) , we can show , is a tensor product of two identical 1-rdms @xmath25 it follows that the solution of the optimization program in eqs .",

    "( [ eq : rdm]-[eq : v2 ] ) .",
    "we have mapped hartree - fock theory exactly onto a rank - constrained semidefinite program ( rc - sdp hf )  @xcite .",
    "the rank - constrained semidefinite program is convex except for the rank constraint ; the nonconvexity of the hartree - fock energy functional in the rdm formulation has been transferred to the rank restriction in the sdp formulation . because of the rank constraint , the solution of rc - sdp hf is not necessarily a global solution , meaning that the solution can be a local minimum in the hartree - fock energy and hence , an upper bound on the global energy minimum . unlike traditional formulations of hartree - fock theory , however , rc - sdp hf optimizes the 1-rdm over the convex set of @xmath0-representable 1-rdms , and in practice , we find that this difference makes it much more robust than traditional formulations in locating the global solution .",
    "the second set of conditions , yielding a lower bound , consists of four constraints including @xmath26 and three additional constraints from permuting the indices @xmath11 and @xmath12 and/or @xmath12 and @xmath13 symmetrically .",
    "these convex conditions are a relaxation of the idempotency of the 1-rdm .",
    "they are necessary but not sufficient for the idempotency of the 1-rdm at the hartree - fock solution , and hence , optimization of the sdp program in eqs .",

    "the lb - sdp method yields a _ lower bound on the energy _ from the global hartree - fock solution . in practice",
    ", this lower bound is found to be quite tight , and in some cases it agrees exactly with the global hartree - fock solution .",
    "if lb - sdp produces a 1-rdm solution that is idempotent , then that solution is the global hartree - fock solution .",
    "furthermore , when the upper and lower bounds from rc - sdp and lb - sdp agree , we have a guaranteed certificate that these computed bounds correspond to the global energy minimum of hartree - fock theory .",
    "we have formulated rc - sdp hf and lb - sdp in the spin - orbital basis set .",

    "although we have taken a different path in the derivation of the sdp algorithms for hartree - fock theory , they can be viewed within variational 2-rdm theory as the addition of further constraints on the 2-rdm to ensure that it represents the mean - field ( or hartree - fock ) limit .",
    "the upper - bound algorithm requires a nonconvex rank constraint , and the lower - bound algorithm requires relaxed idempotency conditions . as described above , the combination of the upper - bound and lower - bound sdp algorithms provides a mechanism for certifying the global minimum of hartree - fock theory .",
    "we have shown that global solutions are useful for seeding either wave function or reduced density matrix methods for describing strongly correlated quantum systems .",
    "the sdp - based restricted closed- and open - shell hartree - fock method , described here , is directly extendable to an unrestricted hartree - fock method , which will be presented elsewhere .",
