    "composite of hard and soft materials sometimes results in increase of toughness .",
    "an example is double - network ( dn ) gel that is an interpenetrating network of brittle polyelectrolyte gel and flexible polymer chains .",
    "a dn gel can have much higher toughness than ordinary gels @xcite .",
    "the second example is nacre , which has a layered structure of brittle ceramic and soft organic matrix .",
    "the toughness of nacre is comparable to that of some high - technology structural ceramics@xcite .",
    "in addition , the toughness of brittle @xmath0 ceramics is known to be increased through the incorporation of metals like tungsten , copper or nickel .",
    "the bending strength also increases with the content of these metals@xcite .",
    "these materials have been studied as follows .",
    "tanaka@xcite argued that dn gel locally softens and the crack extends within the softened zone .",
    "he estimated effective fracture energy , whose order of magnitude is consistent with experiments .",
    "with respect to nacre , it is considered that a weak material reduces drastically the stress concentration near the fracture tips@xcite and the maximum stress increases with the repeat period of structure .",
    "okumura examined a double elastic network of hard and soft materials and derived toughness enhancement factors@xcite , where the ratio of the two elastic moduli and the mesh size as well as the volume fraction of each element are especially important in controlling toughness . for the composites of @xmath0 ,",
    "ashby , blunt and bannister emphasize that the inclusions bridge the crack and are stretched as the crack opens , leading to enhancement of toughness@xcite .",
    "they executed experiments of bonding a wire into a thick - wall glass capillary and showed that the toughness increases with the diameter of wires .",
    "it has been derived that the toughness is proportional to the square root of the product of volume fraction and inclusion size , which is confirmed in experiments by tuan and brook@xcite .",
    "although structure of the composite materials may be important in the above examples , we here focus on whether toughness can be improved only by mixing hard and soft materials . specifically",
    ", we consider a model system which consists of particles initially on the triangular lattice .",
    "every nearest - neighbor pair of the particles is connected with a randomly chosen hard or soft spring except those on the initial crack .",
    "each spring is assumed to break if it is subject to stress larger than a threshold value , which is common to all springs .",
    "we numerically investigate behavior of the system when it is stretched at constant velocity and find that the system can hold up larger stress than a uniform system with only a kind of spring can .",
    "moreover , the maximum stress depends on the fraction of soft springs and the ratio of the spring constants , respectively .",
    "there are some related works in the literature@xcite .",
    "in particular , beale and srolovitz studied the system where springs are present with a probability@xcite .",
    "they obtained analytically the distribution function of the initial failure stress and verified it using computer simulation .",
    "espanl , ziga and rubio showed numerically that the stress of the most stretched spring is represented by a function of the initial notch length@xcite . to our knowledge , however , enhancement of the maximum stress or toughness in such a disordered system has not been reported to date .",

    "the last section is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "our model system consists of @xmath1 particles initially on the triangular lattice arranged in @xmath2 columns each of which has alternatingly @xmath3 or @xmath4 particles .",
    "the particles have the same mass and each pair of nearest - neighbor particles is connected by a linear spring of natural length @xmath5 , which is equal to the lattice spacing .",
    "spring constant @xmath6 or @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) is randomly assigned to each spring according to a given ratio @xmath9 .",
    "namely , @xmath10 denotes the fraction of soft springs .",
    "each spring is assumed to break if the force on the spring exceeds a threshold value @xmath11 , which is common to all springs .",
    "the broken springs do not generate any elastic force . as shown in fig .",
    "[ figtcut ] , twenty springs from the top between the @xmath12th and the @xmath13th columns of particles are cut in the initial condition .",
    "thus , the initial crack is about @xmath14 as long as the column length .",
    "the particles on the leftmost ( or rightmost ) column move as one object , and we call them walls ( fig .  [ figtw ] ) .",
    "the walls are moved by an external force in the outward directions at constant velocity @xmath15 as shown in fig .",
    "the walls are assumed to be vertically incompressible .",
    "moreover , the viscous force with viscosity coefficient @xmath16 acts on the particles .",
    "we assume that @xmath15 is slow and the viscous force is strong enough to make the dynamics of particles overdamped .",
    "thus , the motion of the @xmath17th particle obeys the following equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the position of the @xmath17th particle , @xmath20 is the spring constant of the spring between the @xmath17th and @xmath21th particles , and @xmath22 is the unit vector from the @xmath21th particle to the @xmath17th one .",
    "the summation runs over the nearest neighbors of the @xmath17th particle .",
    "because length and time can be rescaled with the natural length @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively , we can set @xmath25 and @xmath26 without loss of generality .",
    "we further assume that @xmath27 for simplicity .",

    "we call @xmath29 the elastic modulus ratio in this paper .",
    "simulations are basically carried out using the fourth - order runge - kutta method with the time step @xmath30 . however , the time step is changed temporally when a spring breaks as follows . if the computed force of a spring , @xmath31 , which is below the threshold @xmath11 at time @xmath32 exceeds @xmath11 until @xmath33 , we approximate the change of force between time @xmath34 and @xmath35 by a linear function and obtain the new time step @xmath36 determined by @xmath37 .",
    "that is , @xmath38 after the motion of the particles between @xmath34 and @xmath39 are calculated again using the fourth - order runge - kutta method , the spring is cut . then , the next step proceeds with the normal time step @xmath40 .    we compute stress @xmath41 and strain @xmath42 in the horizontal direction at the walls as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of particles on each wall , @xmath45 is the horizontal coordinate of the @xmath29th particle , @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the horizontal coordinates of the left and right walls , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the height of the walls and the distance between the walls at the initial time , respectively .",
    "the summation for @xmath17 is taken over the particles on the wall , and @xmath21 runs over the nearest - neighbors of each @xmath17 . since the values of stress evaluated at the left and right walls are almost the same , we do not distinguish them in the following .",

    "it is a kind of mean - field theory which approximates the random and disordered system with an equivalent uniform system .",
    "the spring constant @xmath50 of the uniform system corresponding to our system is determined by the relation @xmath51 thus , the young s modulus @xmath52 is obtained as @xmath53 where @xmath54 . because the number of soft springs increases with @xmath10 , @xmath52 is a decreasing function of @xmath10 .",

    "the toughness is defined as the work required to make a unit area of fracture surface in quasi - static fracture .",
    "we identify the work with the injected energy to the system during advancing of cracks , @xmath82 , which is defined by @xmath83 where @xmath84 represents the area under the s - s curve .",

    "a part of the injected energy is released by the fracture .",
    "the released energy @xmath88 also changes with @xmath10 as shown in fig .",
    "it increases with the ratio of soft springs @xmath10 except around @xmath89 .",
    "this is partly because a soft spring releases larger energy than a hard one in our model ; the spring with spring constant @xmath29 releases energy @xmath90 .",
    "in addition , increase in the number of cut springs also raises @xmath88 . a hard spring",
    "is easily cut by smaller strain than a soft spring .",
    "thus , the crack tip proceeds with avoiding soft springs . as the result",
    ", the crack meanders in the disordered systems , while it goes straight in the uniform systems .",
    "the meandering causes the increase in the number of cut springs , @xmath91 .",
    "we numerically observe that @xmath91 has the maximum near @xmath92 as shown in fig .",
    "the inflection of @xmath88 around @xmath89 is due to the competition of the two factors : the increase of soft springs which pushes up @xmath88 and the decrease of @xmath91 .",
    "precise relation between @xmath82 and @xmath88 is unknown , but they largely exhibit similar change with @xmath10 . fig .",
    "[ eres ] shows that the ratio @xmath93 does not change with @xmath10 very much .",
    "thus , the increase of @xmath88 in the disordered systems also brings the increase of @xmath82 , namely the increase of toughness .",

    "through investigations of fracture in the disordered lattice systems with unequal spring constants , we have found that both of the maximum stress and the toughness improve in the disordered systems . because a soft spring holds larger energy than a hard one , and",
    "because presence of soft springs makes fracture meander , the released energy @xmath88 becomes larger in the disordered systems than the uniform ones .",
    "this leads to the improvement of the toughness .",
    "although we have so far fixed the ratio of the spring constants @xmath29 in the simulations , improvement of maximum stress and fracture toughness is observed in a wide range of @xmath29 in our preliminary computation .",
    "[ topss ] shows the maximum stress @xmath95 for disordered systems with various @xmath29 and fixed @xmath10 at @xmath96 .",
    "compared to the data for @xmath64 in fig .",
    "[ topss_h ] , we realize that the increase of the maximum stress is seen unless @xmath29 is too large",
    ". moreover , @xmath95 increases with @xmath29 in the range @xmath97 and decreases for @xmath98 . for @xmath29 close to @xmath99 ,",
    "@xmath95 is small because the system becomes nearly uniform .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath29 is too large , small strain causes large tension for hard springs but little effects on soft springs .",
    "therefore , most stress is sustained by hard springs only , and soft springs are not effective .",
    "it means that the system behaves like diluted ones where @xmath95 becomes small .",
    "we also observe that energy @xmath82 takes the maximum value at some @xmath100 if @xmath29 is distinctly larger than @xmath99 .",
    "details of the computation will be reported elsewhere .",
    "although the soft and hard springs are cut at the same stress value in our models , this condition can be modified .",
    "let us consider the case where the springs are cut at the same elastic energy @xmath101 .",
    "then , we again find that the toughness improves in the disordered system for @xmath77 , @xmath61 , and @xmath102 ; for @xmath103 , the average @xmath104 and @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 , respectively . because the released energy when a spring is cut is common for all springs , @xmath88 is proportional to the number of cut springs , @xmath91 .",
    "accordingly , the improvement of toughness in the disordered systems is caused as the result of meandering crack .",
    "the maximum stress also increases in some samples as shown in fig .",
    "[ topss_e ] .",
    "however , their average represented by a circle point does not show a clear improvement .",
    "we consider that the maximum stress should depend on @xmath10 , and detailed study of its dependence is planned for the future .",
    "the fracture phenomenon naturally depends on the threshold stress @xmath11 .",
    "it may drastically change with @xmath11 .",
    "our choice that @xmath75 is rather small , and fractures can expand with small strain below @xmath72 .",
    "thus , we have observed fractures without large deformation of the arrangement of the triangular lattice . however , for materials like polymer gels , fractures occur when the material suffers large deformation .",
    "it is interesting to study if such large deformation can improve the maximum stress or the toughness of the materials .",
    "our system is not large enough to be macroscopic .",
    "we have checked that the system of doubled size @xmath109 shows almost the same results .",
    "however , it still may not be sufficient to restore isotropy .",
    "thus , the orientation of the lattice may also have influences on the fracture .",
    "for example , if we use the system rotated by @xmath110 , all spring forces have components parallel to the external force .",
    "thus , the maximum stress can change from our model where the vertical springs do not contribute to the improvement of the toughness .",
    "if we want to obtain results independent of orientation of the system , use of random lattices will be effective because we can expect that isotropy is restored in systems as large as our model .",
    "it is a future problem to investigate such a system .",
    "our findings may be applied to design some new material with high fracture toughness . however , our model is two dimensional and too simple to apply real fractures .",
    "some extensions , for example , to three dimensions or to realistic interactions are future problems ."
