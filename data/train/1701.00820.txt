    "the observed suppression of cosmic ray flux at energies above @xmath1 ev seems confirm the presence of the gzk cutoff predicted in @xcite although the suppression due to the acceleration limits in cosmic ray sources can not be excluded @xcite .",
    "the occurrence of the gzk suppression and the high isotropy of the highest energy cosmic rays are indicative of their extragalactic origin .",
    "the list of potential sources which could give the observed cosmic ray flux includes active galactic nuclei , gamma - ray bursts , fast spinning newborn pulsars , interacting galaxies , large - scale structure formation shocks and some other objects , see reviews @xcite and references therein .",
    "the present knowledge about the highest energy cosmic rays was mainly acquired from the high resolution fly s eye experiment ( hires ) , pierre auger observatory ( auger ) , telescope array experiment ( ta ) , and from the yakutsk complex eas array , see @xcite .",
    "the mass composition of these cosmic rays remains uncertain .",
    "the interpretation of hires and ta data favors predominantly proton composition at energies @xmath2 to @xmath3 ev , whereas the auger data indicate that the cosmic ray composition is becoming heavier with energies changing from predominantly proton at @xmath2 ev to more heavy composition at about @xmath4 ev . the mass composition interpretation of the measured quantities depends on the assumed hadronic model of particle interactions which is based on not well determined extrapolation of physics from lower energies .",
    "the energy spectrum in extragalactic sources is commonly determined by the trail - and - error method when one makes the calculations of the expected at the earth cosmic ray intensity assuming some shape of the source energy spectrum and the source composition .",
    "the calculations follow cosmic ray propagation from the source to the observer , e. g. @xcite .",
    "the standard assumption is that the source spectrum is a power law on magnetic rigidity up to some maximum rigidity .    in our previous work @xcite",
    "we showed how to inverse the procedure and calculate the source function starting from the observed at the earth spectrum without ad hoc assumptions about the shape of source spectrum .",
    "simple cases of the source composition that includes protons and iron nuclei were considered .",
    "the more realistic chemical composition including other nuclei is considered in the present work .",
    "we use the following transport equation for cosmic ray protons and nuclei in the expanding universe filled with the background electromagnetic radiation ( see @xcite for detail ) : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 the system of eqs .",

    "the set of discrete values of particle energy @xmath35 is defined to solve the transport equation numerically .",

    "we have already considered the case of protons and iron nuclei in the source @xcite .",
    "it was found that the solutions of equation ( 5 ) have a physical meaning only for a limited range of proton to iron ratio .",
    "in addition the solution can be unstable relative small deviations of the left hand side of eq .",

    "the minimal value @xmath55 of the parameter @xmath47 was adjusted to provide the smooth positive source spectrum @xmath43 .",

    "to avoid this problem we use the regularization procedure ( eqs . 6,7 ) and perform calculations for a realistic chemical composition .",
    "in addition the same spectral function on the rigidity for the source spectra of different nuclei was assumed .",
    "we found that assumption of heavy composition permits to explain the auger data @xcite .",
    "the auger data favor the transition from a proton source composition to the heavier one as the energy is rising . with our heavy source composition ,",
    "this case is most closely reproduced by the calculations illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "the obtained source spectra ( see figure [ fig : source ] ) resemble the results @xcite based on the analysis of direct transport problems with a power law source spectrum .",
    "the maximum energy of accelerated particles @xmath59 ev is relatively low in this case that alleviates the problem of cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "the calculated composition of cosmic rays at the earth shown in figures 3,4 is also in accordance with the auger measurements .",
