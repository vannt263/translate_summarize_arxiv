    "an intriguing situation arises when a given microscopic model hamiltonian is known to be symmetric under a certain type of transformation , but the expected regularity associated with this symmetry does not manifest itself in the physical properties . beyond anomalous",
    "breaking , the only other mechanism known for this type of event is spontaneous symmetry breaking . there , the ground state of a system does not share the symmetries of the hamiltonian . for continuous symmetries ,",
    "a prominent example is the ferromagnetic phase in the heisenberg model , where the ground state breaks the so(3 ) rotational symmetry by singling out one certain magnetization axis .    in this article",

    ", psb has emerged in different contexts for higher dimensions , and is generally referred to the real space component of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite , which additionally includes time reversal symmetry breaking @xmath1 .",
    "however , it has remained elusive in most cases to define a model which spontaneously generates psb . in the spin chain model which we discuss here , the algebraic structure of the adjoint representation of su(3 ) at each site of the spin chain allows to accomplish this . in this contribution , we analyze the degenerate ground state manifold of this model and study some low - energy properties .",
