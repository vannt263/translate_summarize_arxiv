    "community identification algorithms have been extensively used as a way to improve the quality perceived by users navigating through the web .",
    "search engines have incorporated this kind of technology as a source of information for their ranking algorithms and new applications , such as automatic directory creation .",
    "furthermore , community identification studies have proven to be of great value to researchers trying to increase their understanding of the information society .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the use of community identification algorithms to local communities , such as those that interact with portals or use specific services in the web , has not been much studied .",
    "the direct application of existing algorithms to local community identification does not yield relevant results .",
    "the main reason is the difference between the processes associated with service creation in the two levels : local and global .",
    "the creation of services in the web as a whole , global context , is governed by distributed and uncoordinated processes .",
    "for instance , someone s decision to reference one page authored by someone else does not have to go through any regulatory agency and does not need its peer s authorization .",
    "therefore , the majority of links in the web can be considered to have a semantic of reputation associated with it .",
    "differently , portals are created in a centralized and coordinated manner .",
    "the structures are created for navigational and business purposes leading to a completely different structure  @xcite .",
    "this is why current community identification algorithms do not provide good results in that type of environment .",
    "the availability of user access information in the case of a local context is another important fact that should be noted .",
    "the combination of the community identification algorithms with user access information would be very valuable to content providers , that can provide specific services to specific communities  @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of user access patterns on the community discovery process also allows us to infer communities even from a source that does not have explicit relationship information . neither the books of an online bookstore nor the games provided by an isp are explicitly related and , therefore , can take advantage of such technique . as the web evolves , new kinds of services , not explicitly related , are created and made available to the users accentuating the need for algorithms designed to work based on evidences other than link information .",
    "examples include streaming media and game services .",
    "this work proposes and evaluates a technique for local community identification based on user access patterns .",
    "our approach starts from a well - known community identification algorithm , the _ hyperlink - induced topic search _ ( hits ) .",
    "we then propose a way of transforming user access information into a graph - based structure to be used jointly with the hits algorithm .",
    "a methodology to evaluate communities that takes into account the semantic meaning associated with each community is also supplied . in order to exemplify the benefits of our approach ,",
    "we show two case studies based on services available on the internet .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : related - work ] we present the related work . section  [ sec : local - comm - ident ] presents the local community identification algorithm and proposes a methodology to evaluate the results .",
    "section  [ sec : case - studies ] presents two case studies , based on actual logs from real online services .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusion ] discusses the concluding remarks and future work .",
    "a considerable amount of research has been developed on community identification over the web .",
    "most of the approaches focus on analyzing text content , considering vector - space models for the objects usually related to information retrieval  @xcite , hyperlink structure connecting the pages  @xcite , markup tags associated with the hyperlinks or the combination of the previously cited sources of information  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they are restricted to objects that contain implicit information provided by the authors.our work , on the other hand , is based solely on user access behavior .",
    "besides , we are considering community identification applied to a local context instead of the whole web .",
    "our approach aims to adapt the graph based community identification algorithm described in  @xcite .",
    "some modifications to  @xcite that takes into account user information have already been proposed in  @xcite . however , this work was not focused on the community identification capabilities of  @xcite and also considered a different representation of user patterns .    other relevant aspect of our work is the proposal of a community evaluation methodology that can be applied to other techniques already proposed such as  @xcite for comparison purposes .",
    "most of the comparison methodologies proposed so far are based on disjunction and coverage of the communities not taking into account semantic meaning .",
    "the hits algorithm was initially proposed as a method to improve the quality of searches on the web  @xcite .",
    "it takes answers to a query from a text - based search engine and changes the ranking of these web pages considering the underlying hyperlinked structure connecting them .",
    "this approach , formerly known as link analysis , was also the base for several other related studies  @xcite .",
    "the links are considered as a way to represent correlations between pages , inducing a certain reputation / quality to a web page pointed to by another .",
    "the algorithm identifies pages that provide valuable information for a determined query and also , pages that are sources of good links for the query .",
    "these two kinds of pages are respectively called authorities and hubs . the query in the search application is used to limit the scope of the web considered by the algorithm at each execution .",
    "therefore , it limits its coverage to a certain subject expressed by a user in terms of his / her query .",
    "the idea behind hits is to identify hubs and authorities through a mutually reinforcing relationship existent between the pages .",
    "this relationship may be expressed as follows : a good hub is a page that points to good authorities and a good authority is a page that is pointed to by good hubs .",
    "this approach is very successful for the search application since it lacks some of the weakness presented by other simple link analysis strategies like indegre and outdegre ranking  @xcite .",
    "an iterative algorithm may be used to break the circularity of the mutually reinforcing relationship and to compute authority and hub weights for each page .",
    "thus , each page @xmath0 , has associated with it an authority weight @xmath1 , and a hub weight @xmath2 .",
    "these weights form a ranking of the pages ranging from good hubs / authorities , with high @xmath2/@xmath1 values , to bad ones , with low @xmath2/@xmath1 .",
    "the weights are iteratively evaluated by the following procedure :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 indicates the existence of a link link from @xmath0 to @xmath5 .",
    "let a denote the adjacency matrix of the web page s subgraph to be considered by the hits algorithm , i.e. , @xmath6 $ ] is equal to one if there is a link from @xmath0 to @xmath5 and 0 otherwise .",
    "the process of computing the weights may be rewritten to : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are arrays storing authority and hub information for all the pages considered .",
    "then , it can be shown that , the authority and hub arrays , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , converge to the principal eigenvector of @xmath10 and @xmath11 respectively .",
    "although the initial work of hits only considered the principal eigenvector of @xmath12 and @xmath11 , an extension to it  @xcite , proposed to use the same approach to identify communities of pages over the whole web .",
    "the approach of the authors is to use the non - principal eigenvectors of the matrices @xmath10 and @xmath11 in order to identify other communities of web pages .",
    "thus , by computing the non - principal eigenvectors we can identify other @xmath8 s and @xmath9 s arrays identifying other communities .",
    "an implicit ranking of the communities can be derived by this method : the principal eigenvectors identifies the most important community over the pages , the second principal eigenvectors explicit the second most important community over the pages , etc .",
    "our approach applies the methodology to find communities on a graph , introduced by kleinberg , to another context .",
    "our goal is to identify communities of users that share a common interest , while accessing a service .",
    "user access patterns are used in order to infer relationships between them .",
    "the generation of the graph representing the relationships and its application to the hits algorithm is described in the next section .",
    "usually , the information used by the community identification algorithms is provided by the authors of the services .",
    "thus the communities identified reflect the authors perception of the world .",
    "for instance , when these methods are applied to the web  @xcite , they use information explicited by the links connecting the pages as a way to infer relationship between them .",
    "this kind of information such as links or textual information is provided on the creation of the web page and is influenced by the author s unique view of the object .    in the case of local community identification ,",
    "i.e. , community identification restricted to a specific service , we consider the users s viewpoint .",
    "the author s point of view can be taken from the centralized process that creates the service , which is directly reflected in the service organization ( e.g. , the navigational structure of the service ) .    although user access patterns are of great interest to local community identification , it is not straightforward how it should be treated .    at first sight , we would consider the objects as being the source of a unique view about a certain subject .",
    "this procedure is successful while considering the whole web since each page represents a view about a subject provided by its author .",
    "using objects as nodes at the graph and links derived from user access data would not represent such a unique interpretation of the data since different users have different interests when accessing an object .",
    "therefore , we propose to use the accesses to a service in order to create a graph that maps the relationship between its users and not between its objects .",
    "this is a departure from the traditional approach taken by community identification algorithms .",
    "most services in the web log files that record user requests to their objects .",
    "these logs have information about the objects requested by each user and some additional information such as the time it was issued or the status returned . through the analysis of these logs , we can group requests into user sessions that are limited by a period of inactivity of the users  @xcite . in this work ,",
    "the sessions are considered to be the basic unit expressing a user interest , although other basic units such as the user itself or a single request could be used with a few adaptations .",
    "each session presented in the log is considered to be a node of a graph that represent user access patterns .",
    "the connection between any two nodes @xmath0 an @xmath5 is directed and the weight , @xmath13 $ ] , between related nodes is computed by :    @xmath14 = \\frac{\\mid o_p \\cap o_q \\mid } { \\mid o_p \\mid } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath15 represents the set of objects accessed in the nth session .    after constructing matrix @xmath16 , that expresses the relationship between the user sessions",
    ", we identify the communities by applying the hits algorithm exchanging @xmath17 to @xmath16 .",
    "the authority weight of a session @xmath18 in a community @xmath19 , given by @xmath20 , is used in order to characterize the communities .",
    "the intuition behind this procedure is that the authority weight of a session is related to the authority weight of the objects requested in it .",
    "the subject treated by each community is implicitly defined by its members , i.e. , sessions with high authority weights .",
    "after user communities have been identified , a way to express their interrelationship must be provided .",
    "this comparison , in terms of their similarities / dissimilarities , is of great value to service providers since it is this sort of information that would help them to design better services .",
    "for instance , one might decide to provide a personalized service to its users based on information stored in the communities .",
    "the weights @xmath20 , associated with each pair session / community , generate a rank of the sessions within the communities .",
    "based on the rankings , our analysis tries to identify good and bad sessions for each community .",
    "these rankings pass through a series of data analysis techniques in order to provide interrelationships and interpretations for the communities .",
    "we use the spearman rank correlation coefficient  @xcite to compare two communities .",
    "this correlation coefficient is a non - parametric ( distribution - free ) rank statistic proposed by spearman as a measure of the strength of the correlation between two variables through the analysis of the rankings imposed by them .",
    "the spearman method can be used to calculate the correlation between any communities @xmath8 and @xmath21 by : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the difference in rank position of corresponding sessions . the @xmath24 value , can be considered to be an approximation to the exact correlation coefficient that could be found if the authority weights for each session were considered .",
    "the spearman rank correlation varies from -1 to 1 .",
    "completely opposite rankings are indicated by -1 while equal rankings are represented by 1 .",
    "we define distance ( i.e. , @xmath25 ) as the separation of two communities and calculate it by the following : @xmath26 the above definition is useful for visualization purposes and for analyzing the communities , as shown in the examples provided in section  [ sec : case - studies ] .    another important artifact related to community evaluation is the ability to discover the subjects represented by each of them . a simple , yet robust , method is to take into consideration the objects accessed by the users in each session .",
    "we split the sessions into three disjoint sets with respect to each community , the set of members , the set of non - members and the rest of them .",
    "the set of members is constituted by the top _",
    "n _ sessions of the community ranking .",
    "the non - members set is formed by the sessions occupying the lowest _",
    "n _ positions of the ranking .",
    "the remaining sessions are included in a third set not considered through the rest of the evaluation process .",
    "the value of @xmath27 should be chosen based on the level of specificity desired or on the information available about the objects .",
    "after classifying sessions as members , non - member and indifferent , we proceed by evaluating positively the objects accessed by the sessions belonging to the members set and negatively the objects accessed by the sessions belonging to the non - members set .",
    "the weight associated with each pair object / session is calculated by a measure based on a _ tf - idf _",
    "@xcite approach , usually employed by information retrieval techniques .",
    "the frequency ( _ tf _ ) of an object within a session represents its importance in the scope of the session , while the distinction capability ( _ idf _ ) provided by the object is computed by : @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the total number of sessions and @xmath30 represents the number of session in which the object @xmath31 was accessed .",
    "this section presents the results obtained by the application of the proposed techniques to two different applications : an online bookstore and an audio streaming media server providing content for an online radio .",
    "the focus of interest are the books for the online bookstore and songs for the audio streaming media server .",
    "the main reason for choosing these applications was the lack of any explicit relationship between objects provided by the service authors .",
    "the data comprises one week of accesses to each service .",
    "the dataset from the bookstore was collected from august 1st to august 7th of 1999 , while the audio streaming media dataset was collected from january 13th to january 19th of 2002 .",
    "the online bookstore considered here is a service specialized on computer science literature and operates exclusively on the internet . throughout the period ,",
    "the bookstore received 1.7 million requests , 50,000 of which were requests for information about books , such as : authors , price , category , and reviews . only those types of requests",
    "were considered in this experiment .",
    "we used 30 minutes as a threshold for the period of inactivity . as a result",
    ", we found 40,000 users sessions .",
    "the online radio service provides a web interface to an audio streaming media server that provides songs .",
    "users can create personal radios , by specifying the songs they want to listen to , or choose a previous stored radio . in the process of radio creation , users can listen excerpts of the songs before they are inserted in the radio s playlist .",
    "the streaming media server received 2.3 million requests , 662,000 of them were requests for full songs .",
    "only those requests were considered in this experiment because we only wanted to capture the behavior of users who were already listening established radios .",
    "again we used 30 minutes of inactivity period as a threshold .",
    "the number of sessions found was 78,000 .",

    "the communities were named from c1 to c10 .",
    "the qualitative analysis of subjects covered by each community is presented in table  [ tab : qualitative : bookstore ] . for this analysis ,",
    "the first half of the sessions ranking were considered to be the community members and the second half the non - members .",

    "analyzing table  [ tab : qualitative : bookstore ] , we can infer the following interpretation for each community :    * community c1 is basically formed by users interested in database certification that show less interest in network and programming questions related to web development .",
    "* community c2 have users that show some interest in web development , while their main interests are networked applications involved with it , less importance is given to database and certification program by the users of this community .",
    "* distributed computing is the main interest treated by community c3 , this community is less related to databases and microsoft platforms / applications . * community c4 aggregates users interested in low level programming basically related to operating system s issues .",
    "it is interesting to note that this community is also less related to databases and microsoft , similar to community c3 , because these platforms are , generally , less flexible . *",
    "the main interests of users pertaining to community c5 are hardware specification of database systems .",
    "the close relationship between this community and management of such systems , induced by the interest in digital business books , also worths mention .",
    "* community c6 is formed by users interested in network administration of microsoft systems .",
    "the community is mainly related to certification programs about this subject . *",
    "low - level programming and scripting for web development are the main interests of users belonging to community c7 .",
    "they are are not interested , although , in the network problems related to web development .",
    "* community c8 is also related to low - level web development issues .",
    "the main difference between c8 and c7 is the fact that in c8 the database category is underprivileged in favor of the ones bottom - ranked in c7 .",
    "* community c9 is also related to web development such as c7 and c8 , although the users of this community express some interest in certification programs .",
    "this information was gathered by the analysis of the whole set of categories for this community .",
    "* certification in database systems is the main concern of users belonging to community c10 .",
    "we use two data analysis techniques , sammon s mapping and hierarchical clustering , to increase our understanding of the communities .",
    "the sammon s mapping  @xcite is a nonlinear projection method closely related to metric multi - dimensional scaling ( mds ) .",
    "this method tries to optimize a cost function that describes how well pairwise distances in a data set are preserved on the generated projection .",
    "the projection derived by the use of sammon s mapping can be seen in figure  [ fig : bookstore : graphs].(a ) . figure  [ fig : bookstore : graphs].(b ) shows the hierarchical clustering obtained by the use of the the pairwise distance matrix between communities and the complete - linkage method  @xcite .",
    "the complete - linkage method works as follows :    1 .",
    "assign to each community its own cluster and consider the distance between clusters to be the same one between the respective communities .",
    "2 .   find the closest clusters and merge them into a single one .",
    "3 .   compute the distances between this new cluster and each of the others .",
    "the distance between two clusters is calculated as being the longest distance connecting any sessions belonging to each cluster .",
    "repeat steps 2 and 3 until all session are grouped into a single cluster containing all the sessions .",
    "figure  [ fig : bookstore : graphs].(c ) shows the distances between the clusters merged in each step of the algorithm .",
    "as expected , both methods give similar results .",
    "they group together communities that are closely related like c1 and c10 , and place apart communities that have no relation like c6 and c5 .",
    "it is even more interesting to notice that communities like c8 and c9 , that at a first look seem similar , are correctly separated by both methods .",
    "the top clusters of the hierarchy shown in figure  [ fig : bookstore : graphs].(b ) , separate the dataset in two very distinct groups .",
    "the first one , formed by ( c2 , c3 , c4 , c5,c7 ) represents a group where most of the users are interested in low - level questions , like programming and networking , usually related to operating systems .",
    "the other one , formed by ( c1 , c6 , c9 , c10 ) , represents a group of users mostly interested in certification programs and their interests vary from network administration to web development .",
    "the dispersion of interests found on the latter group was automatically identified .",
    "this can be derived from the highest cluster distance considered for this merge , figure  [ fig : bookstore : graphs].(c ) , and also by the dispersion of the points on the sammon s mapping projection , figure  [ fig : bookstore : graphs].(a ) .",
    "the analisys of community clusters can be extended to the whole hierarchy with similar results .",
    "the sammon s distribution provides a comprehensive visualization of the relations expressed by the hierarchy and the use of both techniques together is a great start point for analysis of community data .",
    "the quality of the results obtained in the analysis is an evidence of the applicability of the distance metric based on spearman correlation .",

    "communities c3 and c10 , that are located apart in both representations , seems to represent different interests of their users .",
    "although the same kind of analisys based on similarities of communities and their interests can be done for this dataset , we want to point out other dataset features identified by the algorithm without relying upon any explicit information .",
    "one of them is related to the structure of the phonographic industry existing in brazil and the other one is related to the specificity of each dataset .",
    "even for an untrained observer , table  [ tab : qualitative : radio ] shows that users of the online radio exhibit strong interest in local music .",
    "much of the categories cited are of brazilian music , even though all top international albums were also available .",
    "this fact is extremely important since it reflects what happens everyday on brazilian streets .",
    "the ifpi music piracy report  @xcite shows that over 50% of the piracy in brazil is domestic and , therefore , many questions concerning the survival of the local phonographic industry production are being raised .",
    "the algorithm s capability of confirming a behavior observed in the the society is very interesting since it can shed light on new questions .",
    "the specificity level of each dataset is different and the algorithm is able to reflect this fact . the online bookstore is specialized in computer science while the online radio service provides access to different music styles from different nationalities .",
    "the slightly higher distance measures used in the each merge step is an evidence of the latter , figures  [ fig : bookstore : graphs].(c ) and  [ fig : radio : graphs].(c ) .",
    "also we can see in the sammon s mapping that the communities found in the audio streaming media dataset , figure  [ fig : radio : graphs].(a ) , are more spread than the ones of the bookstore dataset , figure  [ fig : radio : graphs].(a ) .",
    "the methodology proposed offers several advantages over the graph - based algorithms in their pure form when applied to the context of local community identification . the communities identified represent the user s perception of the information provided by the services , and this understanding gives service providers a great opportunity to service improvement .    an evaluation methodology based on data analysis available was also proposed .",
    "the evaluation technique is based on _ tf - idf _ ranking of occurrences and the spearman rank correlation .",
    "the former is used to provide the focus of each community and the latter , derive a pairwise distance metric .",
    "the benefits of these methods are exemplified by the case studies , based on actual data of two real services available in the web .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are encouraging and show that the proposed techniques and metrics are promising for characterizing the interests of users accessing a service in the web . yet , this is just an introductory study and we must devote much attention to other possibles metrics , datasets and applicabilities of the proposed technique . the temporal emergence of communities and their evolution is also of great interest .",
