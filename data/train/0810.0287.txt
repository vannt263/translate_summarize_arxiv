    "<S> application of pressures or electron - doping through co substitution into fe sites transforms the itinerant antiferromagnet bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 into a superconductor with the @xmath1 exceeding 20  k. we carried out systematic transport measurements of bafe@xmath2co@xmath3as@xmath0 superconductors in pressures up to 2.5  gpa , and elucidate the interplay between the effects of electron - doping and pressures . for the underdoped sample with nominal composition @xmath4 , application of pressure </S>",
    "<S> strongly suppresses a magnetic instability while enhancing @xmath5 by nearly a factor of two from 11  k to 21  k. in contrast , the optimally doped @xmath6 sample shows very little enhancement of @xmath7  k under applied pressure . our results strongly suggest that the proximity to a magnetic instability is the key to the mechanism of superconductivity in iron - pnictides .    </S>",
    "<S> the recent discovery of superconductivity at 26  k in the carrier - doped quaternary iron oxy - pnictide lafeaso attracted tremendous interest among the scientific community around the world @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , the ternary iron - pnictide family rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 ( r= ba , sr , ca ) with the tetragonal thcr@xmath0si@xmath0 structure also has been shown to become a high @xmath1 superconductor upon doping @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the common structural building blocks of the lafeaso and rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 families are the square - lattice fe sheets hybridized with as layers , hence there is no doubt that superconductivity takes place in the feas layers . however , the mechanism of superconductivity is highly controversial . </S>",
    "<S> the rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 family is a promising model system for a detailed investigation of the physical properties of the new iron - based high @xmath1 superconductors , because large single crystals are available . </S>",
    "<S> bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is an itinerant antiferromagnet , and exhibits simultaneous structural ( tetragonal to orthorhombic ) and magnetic phase transitions at @xmath8  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> holes doped into the fe sheets through substitution of k@xmath9 ions into the ba@xmath10 sites suppress the magnetic instability , and induce superconductivity with @xmath5 as high as 38 k in ba@xmath11k@xmath3fe@xmath0as@xmath0 with @xmath12 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this strategy of transforming an antiferromagnetic parent phase into a superconductor by doping from the ba@xmath11k@xmath3 charge - reservoir layers is analogous to the recipe used in high @xmath1 copper - oxide superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> however , two recent discoveries show that there are fundamental differences between cuprates and iron - pnictides . </S>",
    "<S> first , one can induce superconductivity in the fe sheets by substituting co @xcite or ni @xciteatoms directly into the fe sites . </S>",
    "<S> co ( ni ) atoms have one ( two ) more electron(s ) than fe atoms , and they donate these extra electrons to feas layers as superconducting carriers . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is in remarkable contrast with the case of cuprates ; doping non - magnetic zn@xmath10 ions with one extra electron into cu sites induces local magnetic moments and destroys superconductivity @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our @xmath13co and @xmath14as nmr measurements in bafe@xmath15co@xmath16as@xmath0 showed no evidence for induced magnetic moments @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> second , one can also suppress the itinerant antiferromagnetism of the parent phase rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 and induce superconductivity without doping by applying pressures @xcite . in cuprates , </S>",
    "<S> application of pressures does not transform the mott - insulating state into a metallic state .    to date </S>",
    "<S> , the mechanism of carrier _ or _ pressure - induced superconductivity in rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 is not understood well , calling for further investigations . in this report , we shed new light on this fascinating problem by exploring the interplay between carrier doping _ and _ pressures through systematic measurements of the electrical resistivity @xmath17 in co - doped bafe@xmath2co@xmath3as@xmath0 single crystals in pressures up to @xmath18  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> we choose two nominal concentrations for the present study : the underdoped bafe@xmath19co@xmath20as@xmath0 ( @xmath5 @xmath21   k ) and optimally doped bafe@xmath15co@xmath16as@xmath0 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath22  k ) . notice that the co dopants replace nominally 4% and 10% of fe sites in @xmath23 and @xmath6 samples , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate that application of pressure drives @xmath23 away from a magnetic instability , while enhancing @xmath1 by nearly a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> the highest @xmath24  k observed for @xmath23 in 2.5  gpa is almost as high as @xmath25  k of @xmath6 , and indicates that the underdoped fe sheets are as susceptible to pressures as undoped rfe@xmath0as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we show that @xmath1 of the optimally doped @xmath6 barely changes with pressure . given that application of pressures also suppresses the magnetic instability in @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath23 , we argue that the proximity to a magnetic critical point plays a crucial role in the superconducting mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> single crystals of co - doped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 were grown out of feas flux , and characterized by x - ray diffraction and electron - probe micro - analysis . </S>",
    "<S> further details can be found in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we cut small piece of crystals with typical dimensions 1 mm @xmath27 1 mm @xmath27 0.15 mm from a larger piece for the electrical resistivity measurements in applied pressure . </S>",
    "<S> sample contacts were made using epotek silver epoxy for conventional four - probe ac - measurements . </S>",
    "<S> we employed a compact double - layered hydrostatic cylindrical clamp cell with a becu outer jacket and a nicral alloy inner core to achieve pressures up to 2.5  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> daphene oil 7373 and 99.99@xmath28 purity sn were used as a pressure transmitting medium and a pressure calibrating gauge , respectively . in order to achieve high precision </S>",
    "<S> , we used a highly flexible home - built ac - measurement system . </S>",
    "<S> we stabilized temperature of the high pressure cell for every data point , instead of continuously sweeping the temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed the consistency of our results by conducting both cooling and warming measurements for every run .    </S>",
    "<S> we begin our discussions with the transport properties of optimally electron - doped bafe@xmath15co@xmath16as@xmath0 . in fig.1 </S>",
    "<S> , we present the temperature dependence of the in - plane ( ab - plane ) resistivity @xmath29 measured for @xmath6 at various hydrostatic pressures . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath29 decreases monotonically with temperature , and we can fit the temperature dependence with a simple power law , @xmath30 , with @xmath310.05 in a broad range of temperatures from @xmath32  k down to @xmath33  k. below @xmath34  k , the resistivity shows t - linear behavior @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) down to @xmath5 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our recent nmr measurements in the same crystal showed that spin susceptibility @xmath37 also undergoes a crossover between two different regimes across @xmath34  k ; @xmath37 decreases monotonically with a pseudo - gap @xmath38  k , then almost levels off below @xmath34  k @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means that low energy spin excitations are abundant in the high temperature regime above @xmath33  k , and the power @xmath39 may be associated with the scattering of electrons by these excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that although the temperature independence of @xmath37 alone might suggest that bafe@xmath15co@xmath16as@xmath0 is a fermi - liquid system below @xmath34  k , the t - linear behavior of @xmath17 indicates the contrary . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that fermi liquid systems would satisfy @xmath40 . instead , the t - linear behaviour is the benchmark of strongly correlated phenomena in copper - oxide high @xmath1 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> for example , optimally doped la@xmath2sr@xmath3cuo@xmath41 exhibits @xmath35 for a wide range of temperatures from t@xmath42 to as high as @xmath43  k @xcite .    upon applying hydrostatic pressure , </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of @xmath29 in @xmath6 decreases substantially in the entire temperature range above @xmath1 , but the temperature dependence shows very little change . to illustrate this point , in fig.2 we plot @xmath29 measured for various pressure values by normalizing the magnitude at 290 k to the result obtained for 2.5  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> all the data set collapse on top of each other except near @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure effect on @xmath5 is also weak . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath5 increases only by @xmath44  k from @xmath45 22  k at @xmath46 to @xmath47  k at @xmath48  gpa , then almost saturates , as summarized in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> the pressure coefficient below 1.25  gpa , @xmath49   k / gpa is by an order of magnitude smaller than that of the undoped antiferromagnetic phase bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite . in the latter case , @xmath50  </S>",
    "<S> k increases quickly to 29  k in a narrower pressure range from 2.5  gpa to 4  gpa as shown in fig.3 . </S>",
    "<S> these contrasting results indicate that once the magnetic instability is completely suppressed by 10% co substitution into fe sites , application of pressures has little effect on @xmath1 in the optimally electron doped system . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be seen if applying higher pressures than 2.5  gpa would further enhance @xmath1 , or even suppress @xmath1 to show a `` dome shape '' in the @xmath51 vs. @xmath5 phase diagram . </S>",
    "<S> however , a naive extrapolation of @xmath1 in bafe@xmath15co@xmath16as@xmath0 to higher pressure values does not seem to achieve as high a @xmath52  k as in the undoped parent phase . </S>",
    "<S> one obvious possibility is that the disorder induced by co substitution into fe limits the highest @xmath1 , but this scenario seems unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> the normal state residual resistivity at 2.5  gpa estimated from the linear extrapolation to @xmath53 is @xmath54  m@xmath55 cm , and this value is about the same as that of undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 at 13  gpa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to notice that the sign of the pressure coefficient @xmath56 is different between the present case of electron doped bafe@xmath15co@xmath16as@xmath0 and </S>",
    "<S> the hole doped ba@xmath57k@xmath58fe@xmath0as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the latter has a negative coefficient , @xmath59  k / gpa @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this may be an indication that the fermi energy @xmath60 of the undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 is located near a singularity of the density of states , and electron and hole - doping place @xmath60 on different slopes .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we turn our attention to the pressure effects on the underdoped , co 4% doped bafe@xmath19co@xmath20as@xmath0 . in fig.4 , we show @xmath29 measured for @xmath23 at various hydrostatic pressures . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence above @xmath34  k is qualitatively similar to that of the optimally doped @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous power law fit to @xmath30 yields a somewhat larger value of the power @xmath620.03 at ambient pressure as shown in fig.2 . unlike the optimally doped @xmath6 , a monotonic decrease of @xmath29 from @xmath32  k down to @xmath63  k is followed by a step - like increase near @xmath64  k. the sharp dip centered around 66  k in the derivative presented in fig.2b , @xmath65 , hints at the presence of a phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> to clarify the origin of the anomaly , we also carried out nmr measurements on the same batch of crystals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the dramatic nmr line broadening and a divergence of the nuclear spin - lattice relaxation rate 1/t@xmath66 below @xmath67  k indicate that this anomaly is caused by a magnetic instability . in what follows , we tentatively represent the magnetic anomaly temperature using the same symbol @xmath68 commonly used for the undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , but we need to keep in mind that the nature of the magnetic instability in the electron doped @xmath23 may be somewhat different . in particular , whether a structural phase transition accompanies the magnetic instability at or near 70  k requires further investigation . </S>",
    "<S> regardless , it is worth pointing out that signatures of the critical slowing down observed above 70  k in our nmr data indicate that this magnetic instability is not strongly first order . since we do nt observe any sharp paramagnetic nmr signals below @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> , we can also conclude that the magnetic instability at @xmath68 affects the entire fe@xmath19co@xmath20as@xmath0 layers . in passing , </S>",
    "<S> a similar step - like resistivity increase is also reported for co - doped lafe@xmath11co@xmath3aso @xcite , srfe@xmath2co@xmath3as@xmath0 ( @xmath69 and 0.15 ) @xcite , and ni - doped bafe@xmath70ni@xmath71as@xmath0 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> with decreasing temperature , @xmath23 also exhibits a superconducting transition to a zero resistivity state below @xmath72  </S>",
    "<S> k. given our nmr finding that the magnetic instability affects all sites in the fe@xmath19co@xmath20as@xmath0 layers , we rule out the possibility that this superconducting transition is caused by macroscopic inhomogeneity in co concentrations . </S>",
    "<S> since the magnetic instability precedes the superconducting transition , the superconducting state should be considered granular , in analogy with the case of underdoped high @xmath1 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> we may naturally understand the apparent coexistence of @xmath68 and @xmath1 based on the following simple argument . </S>",
    "<S> the key point is that the superconducting coherence length @xmath73  nm @xcite is very short in iron - pnictide superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> assume that each co atom donates an electron to nearby fe sites , destroys magnetism locally , and creates a superconducting island . </S>",
    "<S> as a ballpark figure , one may assume that the diameter of the island is roughly equal to the in - plane superconducting coherence length , @xmath74 , and involves more than ten fe sites . </S>",
    "<S> then the co doping level of 4% is more than enough to achieve the classical percolation limit of 50% for two - dimensions , and hence zero resistance . </S>",
    "<S> this situation of the `` reverse swiss cheese model '' is the opposite to the so - called `` swiss cheese model . '' </S>",
    "<S> the latter describes the destruction of superconductivity in zn doped high @xmath1 cuprates @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we notice three striking features in the pressure effects in fig.4 . </S>",
    "<S> first , with applying pressure , @xmath68 is markedly suppressed from @xmath75  k to @xmath76  k in 2.5  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> this strong pressure effect on @xmath68 is comparable to the case of the undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 . in the latter , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath77  k is suppressed to @xmath78  k in 2.5  gpa @xcite ; see the phase diagram in fig.3 for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> second , as the magnetic instability is suppressed , the temperature dependence of @xmath29 becomes increasingly similar to that of @xmath61 . </S>",
    "<S> we show the representative fits of @xmath29 by a power - law in fig.2 , and summarize the pressure dependence of the power @xmath79 in fig.5 . </S>",
    "<S> the power @xmath79 gradually decreases with increasing pressure from @xmath80 at 0  gpa to 1.4 at 2.5  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> fig.5 suggests that the power @xmath79 for @xmath23 approaches @xmath81 in higher pressures , which is the value observed for the optimumally doped @xmath6 sample . </S>",
    "<S> it is tempting to interpret this as an indication that @xmath82 is the universal value in the metallic state above @xmath33  k of co - doped superconducting bafe@xmath2co@xmath3as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we caution , however , that a similar power - law fit of the resistivity data reported by by fukazawa et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for undoped bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 in 13  gpa yields a smaller value , @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> third , application of pressures results in a very strong enhancement of @xmath1 from 11  k to 21  k in 2.5  gpa . </S>",
    "<S> that is , one can enhance @xmath1 nearly by a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the observed pressure coefficient , @xmath84   k / gpa is quite sizable , and nearly by an order of magnitude larger than 0.65  k / gpa of the optimally doped @xmath6 sample . </S>",
    "<S> equally interesting is our finding that @xmath1 of the @xmath23 sample shows no sign of saturation up to 2.5  gpa , unlike the case of @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , a naive extrapolation of @xmath1 in fig.3 shows that @xmath1 of @xmath23 may exceed that of @xmath6 and approaches the maximum @xmath1 of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> we recall that many earlier studies of pressure effects on @xmath1 in undoped or hole - doped iron - pnictides showed either a dome - like shape in the @xmath1 vs. @xmath51 phase diagram , or a linear decrease of @xmath5 at elevated pressures @xcite .    to summarize , we demonstrated contrasting behaviors of pressure effects on superconductivity between optimally electron - doped bafe@xmath15co@xmath16as@xmath0 and underdoped bafe@xmath19co@xmath20as@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that once the magnetic instability is completely suppressed by electron doping , application of high pressures has very little effect on superconductivity and the qualitative behavior of the normal state resistivity . on the other hand , the suppression of a magnetic instability with pressure results in a large enhancement of @xmath1 by nearly a factor of two . </S>",
    "<S> this finding strongly suggests that magnetism and superconductivity are strongly correlated . </S>",
    "<S> needless to say , it does not necessarily mean that the glue of the superconducting cooper pairs are magnetic fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> instead , one can certainly view fig.3 as evidence for competition between magnetism and superconductivity . in any event , </S>",
    "<S> our new results on underdoped @xmath23 establish a link between superconductivity and magnetism , and show that fine tuning magnetic fluctuations with pressure is as effective as doping more carriers by additional co doping .    </S>",
