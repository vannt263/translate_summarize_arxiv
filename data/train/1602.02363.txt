    "while generally short grbs are of merger origin @xcite and long ones come from collapsars @xcite , this classification is imperfect due to a large overlap in duration distributions of the two populations @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite independently discovered a third peak in the duration distribution in the batse 3b catalog , located between the short and long groups , and the statistical existence of this intermediate class was claimed to be supported @xcite with the use of batse 4b data .",

    "other datasets , i.e. rhessi @xcite and bepposax @xcite , are both in agreement with earlier results regarding the bimodal distribution , and the detection of a third component was established on a lower , compared to batse and _ swift _ , significance level .",
    "thence , four different satellites provided hints about the existence of a third class of grbs .",
    "those conclusions were based on the finding that a mixture of three standard gaussians is a better fit than a mixture of two gaussians ( a 2-g ) .",
    "this is not surprising , because adding parameters to a nested model always results in a better fit ( in the sense of a lower @xmath11 or a higher maximum log - likelihood @xmath12 ) due to more freedom given to the model to follow the data .",
    "the important questions are whether this improvement is statistically significant , can the three components be related to physically distinct classes , and whether the model is an appropriate one  is there a model that is a better fit ?",

    "is not a definite detection of another physical class of astronomical objects .",
    "all of the post - batse 3b fits were bimodal , not trimodal , even if comprised of three components .",
    "the third peak in the batse 3b sample @xcite was smeared out with the batse 4b catalog when more data was gathered ( see fig .  5 in @xcite ) .",
    "it was suggested by @xcite that the duration distribution corresponding to the collapsar scenario might not necessarily be symmetrical because of a non - symmetrical distribution of envelope masses of the progenitors .",
    "specifically , it was shown by @xcite that the @xmath8 distribution of grbs detected by _",
    "fermi _ is also bimodal for several binnings .",
    "moreover , a number of intrinsically skewed distributions were fitted to the data of batse , _ swift _ and _ fermi _ @xcite , and it was found that mixtures of two skewed components follow the data at least as good ( batse and _ swift _ ) , or better ( _ fermi _ ) than a conventionally used 3-g , and that they are bimodal as well ( in the sense of having two local maxima ; @xcite ) . generally , @xmath20-modality is commonly associated with @xmath20 populations underlying a distribution .",
    "hence , the existence of an intermediate grb class is unlikely .",
    "the analysis of the observed durations was performed by many authors , as reviewed above .",
    "however , the intrinsic duration  the one in the rest frame  of a grb is affected by its cosmological distance , and is shorter than the observed one : @xmath21 considering the median redshift of long grbs , @xmath22 , it is evident that grbs with @xmath23 have an intrinsic duration generally smaller than @xmath24 , which makes them short ones . note that the classification of short grbs is the same in both the observer and rest frames .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath25 distribution was performed rarely due to a small number of grbs with measured redshift : @xcite examined 95 , @xcite analyzed 130 , and @xcite investigated 248 _ swift _ grbs . while @xcite focused on the apparent bimodality , and @xcite did not translate the observed durations to the rest frame , @xcite found that a 3-g follows the _ swift _ data better than a 2-g ( in observer as well as in the rest frame ; see their figs .  6 and 7 ) . however , in both frames the distributions were bimodal , yet apparently skewed , and hence the existence of an intermediate class is still unlikely .",
    "the plausible explanation of this phenomenon is that there are two grb classes with intrinsically non - symmetrical duration distributions .",
    "the aim of this article is to perform a statistical analysis of the grbs with measured redshift in order to test against the existence of the intermediate grb class .",
    "mixtures of various distributions ( standard gaussians , skew - normal , sinh - arcsinh and alpha - skew - normal ) are applied to verify whether the statistical significance of a three - gaussian fit might by challenged by a mixture of skewed distributions with only two components . both the observed and intrinsic durations are examined .",

    "two standard fitting techniques are commonly applied : @xmath11 fitting and maximum likelihood method ( ml ) .",
    "for the first , data needs to be binned , and despite various binning rules are known ( e.g. freedman - diaconis , scott , knuth etc . ) , they still leave place for ambiguity , as it might happen that the fit may be statistically significant on a given significance level for a number of binnings @xcite .",
    "the ml method is not affected by this issue and is therefore applied herein . however , for display purposes , the binning was chosen based on the freedman - diaconis rule .    having a distribution with a probability density function ( pdf ) given by @xmath29 ( possibly a mixture ) , where @xmath30 is a set of @xmath18 parameters ,",
    "the log - likelihood function is defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the datapoints from the sample to which a distribution is fitted .",
    "the fitting is performed by searching a set of parameters @xmath33 for which the log - likelihood is maximized @xcite .",
    "when nested models are considered , the maximal value of the log - likelihood function , @xmath34 , increases when the number of parameters @xmath18 increases .    for nested as well as non - nested models , the akaike information criterion ( @xmath35 )",
    "@xcite may be applied .",
    "the @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 a preferred model is the one that minimizes @xmath35 .",
    "the formulation of @xmath35 penalizes the use of an excessive number of parameters , hence discourages overfitting .",
    "it prefers models with fewer parameters , as long as the others do not provide a substantially better fit .",
    "the expression for @xmath35 consists of two competing terms : the first measuring the model complexity ( number of free parameters ) and the second measuring the goodness of fit ( or more precisely , the lack of thereof ) . among candidate models with @xmath37 ,",
    "let @xmath38 denote the smallest .",
    "then , @xmath39 where @xmath40 , can be interpreted as the relative ( compared to @xmath38 ) probability that the @xmath41-th model minimizes the @xmath35 .. in bayesian language , akaike weight corresponds to the posterior probability of a model ( under assumption of different prior probabilities ; @xcite ) . ]",
    "the @xmath35 is suitable when @xmath42 is large , i.e. when @xmath43 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also references therein ) .",
    "when this condition is not fulfilled , a second order bias correction is introduced , resulting in a small - sample version of the @xmath35 , called @xmath44 : @xmath45 the relative probability is computed similarly to when @xmath35 is used , i.e. eq .  ( [ eq4 ] ) is valid when one takes @xmath46 .",
    "thence , @xmath47    it is important to note that this method allows to choose a model that is best among the chosen ones , but does not allow to state that this model is the best among all possible .",
    "hence , the probabilities computed by means of eq .",
    "( [ eq4a ] ) are the relative , with respect to a model with @xmath48 , probabilities that the data is better described by a model with @xmath49 .",
    "what is essential in assessing the goodness of a fit in the @xmath35 method is the difference , @xmath46 , not the absolute values of the @xmath49 .",

    "researches conducted so far on the grb duration distribution , three components were found to describe the observed distribution statistically better than a mixture of two components .",
    "however , in all previous analyses a mixture of standard ( non - skewed ) gaussians was fitted .",
    "this might possibly lead to erroneous conclusions , as describing a non - symmetrical distribution by a mixture of symmetrical components will eventually lead to overfitting ( some of the two - component skewed distributions considered below are characterized by fewer free parameters than a standard three - gaussian ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite suggested that the duration distribution of long grbs might not necessarily be symmetrical because of a non - symmetrical distribution of envelope masses of the progenitors .",
    "since @xcite observed that the distribution of @xmath8 may be in form of a mixture of standard gaussians , many authors followed this approach and also restrained the analysis to non - skewed normal distributions @xcite .",
    "therefore , in light of the suggestion of @xcite that the @xmath0 distributions underlying the two well - established grb classes @xcite may not be symmetrical @xcite , the following distributions are considered herein .    a mixture of @xmath56 standard normal ( gaussian ) @xmath57 distributions : @xmath58 being described by @xmath59 free parameters : @xmath56 pairs @xmath60 and @xmath61 weights @xmath62 , satysfying @xmath63 .",

    "skewness of an sn distribution is @xmath67 where @xmath68 , hence the skewness @xmath69 is solely based on the shape parameter @xmath19 , and is limited to the interval @xmath70 .",
    "the mean is given by @xmath71 .",
    "when @xmath72 , the sn distribution is reduced to a standard gaussian , @xmath57 , due to @xmath73 .",

    "the _ swift _ subsample , this implies @xmath95 .",
    "therefore , in what follows the @xmath44 is used instead of the @xmath35 .",
    "first , the sample of 408 grbs with measured both redshift and duration is examined .",
    "the pdfs , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq5])([eq8 ] ) , with @xmath96 or 3 , are fitted to the @xmath8 distributions using the ml method from sect .",

    "the best fit among the examined is the one that yields the smallest @xmath44 .",
    "the results of the fitting procedure applied to the observed durations are gathered in table  [ tbl1 ] , and the fits , in graphical form , are displayed in fig .",
    "contrary to previous reasearches , all of the three - component pdfs ( 3-g , 3-sn , and 3-sas , where the support for the latter is weak ) are trimodal , and the third peak is located in the area of the presumed intermediate grb class , i.e. within the range @xmath97 . to assess its significance",
    "more easily , the @xmath44 and relative probabilities are plotted in fig .",
    "the pdf with minimal @xmath44 is a conventional 3-g , and the second best fit is a 3-sn , with a relative probability of 90.6% .",
    "a 2-sn , however , has substantial support , too , due to @xmath98 .",
    "the remaining two - component fits ( 2-g and 2-sas ) , as well as a 1-asn , yield a strong support having @xmath53 , but the evidence is weaker than for the former three models . the remaining , 3-sas and 2-asn , have considerably less or no support .    the picture revealed by the rest frame duration distribution , @xmath25 , is different . as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the 3-sn and 3-sas are also trimodal , and the 3-g , with the durations being systematically shifted left - wards comparing with the observed durations , lost its third peak , leaving a bimodal distribution with a prominent shoulder in the area of the presumed intermediate grbs .",
    "the parameters of the fits are gathered in table  [ tbl2 ] .",
    "a remarkably different picture , compared to the result of the @xmath26 analysis , follows from the @xmath44 plot in fig .",
    "it turns out that the intrinsic durations are best described by a conventional 2-g ; the second best model is a 3-g , having a relative probability of 17.1% .",
    "the other models have considerably less or almost no support .",
    "this suggests that the intrinsic @xmath0 distribution may be indeed bimodal .    to conclude this section ,",
    "the @xmath99 distribution is possibly trimodal , and in the rest frame , due to the properties of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) , it turns into a bimodal .",

    "generally , inferring an existence or lack of thereof , based on statistical evidence , must be done with care .",
    "having samples with limited size adds difficulty to such an assessment , as in small samples there is more room for statistical fluctuations that might obscure the global picture .",
    "previous researches , cited in sect .",
    "[ intro ] , mostly imply that a 3-g fit is a better descriptive model than a 2-g .",
    "nevertheless , the fits achieved were bimodal , indicating the presence of only two grb classes @xcite .",
    "a remarkable exception was the batse 3b dataset @xcite , where the third peak had a negligible probability of @xmath101 to be a chance occurence .",
    "it turnt out , however , that a bigger dataset obtained by the same instrument did not reveal its presence anymore @xcite .",
    "examining the observed , instead of intrinsic , durations might also cast doubts on the reality of the observed phenomenon . having that in mind",
    ", it is tempting to state that the intermediate grb class is unlikely to be a real class based on the analysis of 408 grbs with known both @xmath0 and redshift .",
    "this statement could be justified with the results presented in sect .",
    "[ res1 ] , where the two best models to describe the @xmath102 distribution were trimodal , but after moving to the rest frame , the most plausible description was provided with a conventional 2-g .",
    "it may appear that the intrinsic durations should trace the physical context of the grbs more appropriately .    on the other hand ,",
    "the grb characteristics are not only sample - dependent , as showed above , but also detector - dependent ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thereofore , lacking a dataset numerous enough for the statistics to provide a convincing proof , one may only claim evidence , or its lack , in a specific sample under consideration ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to get rid of the detector - dependency , only 334 grbs as detected by _",
    "swift _ were examined .",
    "the outcome of this analysis , shown in sect .",
    "[ res2 ] , is surprisingly inconsistent with the one from a bigger sample in sect .",
    "[ res1 ] , being at the same time consistent with previous analyses performed on a bigger sample of _ swift _ grbs  the obtained fits are all uni- or bimodal , and the one with the lowest @xmath44 is a bimodal 3-g ; the next best fits were a unimodal 1-asn and a bimodal 2-sn .",
    "both yield strong evidence in their favor , so it is not possible to unambiguously infer the number of components , or even the modality of the _ swift _ sample .    after moving to the rest frame ,",
    "the problems are not solved , especially that the best fit now is a 2-asn .",
    "the problem with this distribution is that it consists of a bimodal component [ see fig .",
    "[ fig9 ]  ( h ) ] , with locations of its peaks in agreement with the groups of short and long grbs .",
    "it seems like the role of the second component here is to merely adjust the height of the fit .",
    "the second best fit , a bimodal 3-g , has a relative probability of 13.9% .",
    "while this is a statistically valid result , meaning that among the exmined distributions the 2-asn is best balanced between the goodness of fit and the number of parameters , from the physical point of view , regarding the knowledge about grbs , this result is an unrealistic one , as the short and long grbs are known to stem from different progenitors , mergers and collapsars , respectively . even after dismissing the 2-asn ,",
    "differentiating between a 3-g and 1-asn is not possible in the framework of the @xmath44 , as these two models yield @xmath103 .",
    "hence , the currently available redshift distribution unfortunately does not allow to infer the existence of the intermediate grbs class reliably , likely due to the smallness of the sample .",
    "the research conducted so far on different samples of grb duration distributions indicate that a 3-g follows the data better than a 2-g . however , even with three components , the fitted distribution is usually bimodal , implying two physical classes . because a two - component mixture of skewed distributions was shown to be a statistically better fit , in case of",
    "_ fermi_/gbm observations , than the commonly applied 3-g @xcite , in this paper the same approach was undertaken to investigate the modality and goodness of fit in case of grbs with measured both redshift and duration .",
    "the reason for this is that in the rest frame the effects of cosmological factors are mostly elliminated , hence it is expected that it will provide an insight into the properties of grbs .",
    "it was found that in a sample of 408 grbs with known redshift , the best fits3-g and 3-sn  are trimodal ( in the sense of having three local maxima ) , but after moving to the rest frame , a ( unimodal ) 2-g yielded considerably stronger support than any other examined distribution . however , this sample is dominated by detections made by _",
    "swift_/bat ( 334 events , @xmath104 of the total number of grbs with measured @xmath1 ) , and hence this finding might be affected by the fact that grb properties are detector - dependent .",
    "therefore , the _ swift_/bat subsample was also examined , and it turnt out that it is not possible to reliably infer the best fit within the chosen information - theoretic framework ( @xmath44 in this work ) .",
    "this may be caused by the smallness of the sample , and so the solution is to , hopefully , repeat the analysis in the future on a wider grb sample ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "because the mathematical model of the observed as well as intrinsic durations is still lacking , the physical interpretation of the results obtained herein is limitted .",
    "the distribution of intrinsic durations , being systematically shifted towards shorter values , while may be believed to trace the properties of grb population more accurately , is also affected by statistical fluctuations .",
    "considering the _ swift _ subsample , the distributions are strongly dominated by long grbs , what might cause introduction of biases in the analysis undertaken .",
