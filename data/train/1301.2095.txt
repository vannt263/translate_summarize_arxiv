    "if @xmath169 and @xmath170 belong to their definite triality sector , em interaction is sensitive to the triality , and quarks in the strong interaction and neutrinos in the weak interaction do not select the triality , one can produce neutrino mass without invoking right - handed neutrinos@xcite .",

    "astronomically , measurements with wmap space crafts confirm that almost exactly 5 times more dark matter than the normal matter are observed@xcite , which coincides with the number of triality symmetry transformations of an octonion .",
    "the spectral analysis of 511kev emission from positron annihilation from the galaxy@xcite also suggests that the cluster of dark matter , which could be particles in a different triality sector than that in our solar system are distributed in the galaxy .    the cosmological model with standard einstein s cosmology constant @xmath8 defines the density @xmath171 , and the hubble expansion rate @xmath172 defines the density @xmath173 . the ratio of the dark matter density @xmath174 devided by the critical density @xmath175 i.e. @xmath176 is about 24% while the ratio of baryon density @xmath177 is about 4% , which means that the ratio of the mass of the dark matter and the normal matter in the universe as a whole is almost 5 as expected .    * acknowledgement * + the author thanks stan brodsky for attracting attention to the refs.@xcite and sending encouragements .",
