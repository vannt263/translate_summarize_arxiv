    "the cronin effect , which refers to the enhanced hadron production at intermediate transverse momentum ( @xmath0 ) with increasing target nucleus size in proton - nucleus ( pa ) collisions , was first observed by cronin _",
    "@xcite in 1975 at center of mass energy @xmath3 = 27.4 gev .",
    "recent experimental data in @xmath1+au collisions from rhic have shown that similar effect exists at higher collision energy ( @xmath4 = 200 gev ) @xcite .",
    "an adequate understanding of the cronin effect becomes especially important for making reliable theoretical interpretations of the observations in heavy ion collisions at rhic , in which the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) is thought to be created @xcite .",
    "traditional explanations of the cronin effect all involve multiple scattering of incoming partons that lead to an enhancement at intermediate @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the models can reproduce the observed centrality dependence for pions very well .",
    "however , none of these initial - state models would predict a species - dependent cronin effect , as initial state parton scattering precedes fragmentation into the different hadronic species @xcite .",
    "this indicates possible final - state interactions ( fsi ) would possibly contribute to the cronin effect .",
    "recently , hwa and yang @xcite demonstrated the recombination of soft and shower partons in the final state could explain the mass dependent cronin effect .",
    "this model do predict a larger enhancement for protons than for pions at @xmath5 gev / c .",
    "however , the inclusion of recombination from deconfined partons requires a high energy density in initial state , which may not be justified in @xmath1+au collisions .",
    "an alternate way for hadronization is string fragmentation @xcite . in this scenario , hadrons are formed from the decays of excited strings , which result from the recombination of energetic minijet partons and soft strings that produced from initial soft nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "after the hadronization , the followed rescatterings between formed hadrons or between formed hadrons and nucleon spectators should also be taken into account . in this paper",
    "we study quantitatively how the two different hadronization mechanisms ( string fragmentation and parton coalescence ) and the followed final state interactions would contribute to the nuclear modification factors in @xmath1+au collisions at @xmath4 = 200 gev . a multiphase transport model ( ampt ) @xcite with two versions : default ( hadronization from lund string fragmentation , mainly hadronic rescatterings in the final state , version 1.11 ) and string melting ( hadronization from quark coalescence , version 2.11 ) are used to study the later - stage effect . the final state hadronic and/or partonic interactions",
    "are included in the calculations .",
    "quark transverse momentum kick due to multiple scatterings are treated in the same way as in ref .",
    "@xcite . to have a clean test of final state interactions , we assume no quark intrinsic @xmath0 broadening due to initial multiple parton scattering @xcite , and see how the final state interactions would contribute to the cronin effect observed .",
    "we show that recent data on particle species dependence of central - to - peripheral nuclear modification factor @xmath2 at midrapidity for @xmath1+au collisions at rhic can be understood in terms of the hadronization from string fragmentation and the followed hadronic rescatterings in the final state .",
    "the ampt model @xcite is a hybrid model that consists of four main components : the initial conditions , the partonic interactions , conversion from the partonic to the hadronic matter , and the hadronic interactions .",
    "the initial conditions , which include the spatial and momentum distributions of hard minijet partons and soft string excitations , are obtained from the hijing model ( version 1.383 for this study ) .",
    "one uses a woods - saxon radial shape for the colliding gold nuclei and introduces a parameterized nuclear shadowing function that depends on the impact parameter of the collision .",
    "the ratio of quark structure function is parameterized as the following impact - parameter - dependent but @xmath6 ( and flavor)-independent form @xcite @xmath7e^{-x^{2}/0.01},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the light - cone momentum fraction of parton a , and @xmath9 is the parton distribution function .",
    "the impact - parameter dependence of the nuclear showing effect is controlled by @xmath10 with @xmath11 denoting the transverse distance of an interacting nucleon from the center of the nucleus with radius @xmath12 .",
    "the structure of deuteron is described by the hulthen wave function .",
    "scatterings among partons are modeled by the zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) @xcite , which at present includes only two - body elastic scatterings with cross sections obtained from the pqcd with screening masses . in the default ampt model ,",
    "after partons stop interacting , they recombine with their parent strings , which are produced from initial soft nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "the resulting strings are converted to hadrons using the lund string fragmentation model . in case of string melting ,",
    "the produced hadrons from string fragmentation , are converted instead to their valence quarks and antiquarks .",
    "the followed partonic interactions are modeled by zpc .",
    "after the partons freeze out , they are recombined into hadrons through a quark coalescence process .",
    "the dynamics of the subsequent hadronic matter is described by a hadronic cascade , which is based on a relativistic transport model ( art ) .",
    "final hadronic observables including contributions from the strong decays of resonances are determined when the hadronic matter freezes out .",
    "transverse momentum spectra of mid - rapidity ( @xmath13 ) pions , kaons , protons and @xmath14 mesons in @xmath15minimum bias \" @xmath1+au collisions from default ampt ( solid lines ) and string melting ampt ( dashed lines ) versus data from star collaboration ( statistical error only ) @xcite.,width=340 ]",
    "we learn that lin and ko have done a nice study @xcite on global properties of deuteron - gold collisions with default ampt model , which shows good agreement with later experimental data @xcite .",

    "the @xmath2 , which compares particle yield from central collisions to that of peripheral collisions , is defined as the ratio of particle yields in central collisions over those in peripheral ones scaled by number of inelastic binary collisions @xmath30 , that is , @xmath31_{\\textrm{central}}}{[dn/(n_{bin}p_{t}dp_{t})]_{\\textrm{peripheral}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here we use the same @xmath32 value as star collaboration at the corresponding collision centrality @xcite .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "2(a ) that there are only slight differences for the @xmath2 of different particle species .",
    "this is because hadrons are produced from string fragmentation in the lund model , and the fragmentation patterns for different particle species in central collisions and in peripheral collisions are set to be the same .",
    "we note that the @xmath2 of proton and @xmath27 would be larger due to the associate production @xmath33+@xmath34+@xmath27+@xmath35 from initial - state multiple scatterings in the gold beam direction ( @xmath36 ) at large rapidity , as shown in fig .",

    "and this suppression increases with @xmath0 .",
    "since most of the produced particles are pions at mid - rapidity , the scatterings are mainly the particle - pion interactions for @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the mass of corresponding particles . for @xmath39 elastic collisions , the resonance peak centers at the position of @xmath39 center - of - mass energy @xmath40 close to @xmath41 meson rest mass .",
    "since most of the outgoing particles which probably scatter with each other are in the similar directions , the open angle between two scattering particles is small . in our studied @xmath0 and rapidity range , for one particle at low @xmath0 , and another particle with higher energy , the calculated",
    "@xmath40 is closer to the resonance peak . as a result ,",

    "similar argument is also valid for k@xmath42 scatterings . for heavier particles like antiproton , @xmath14 meson , @xmath25 , the @xmath2 increases at low @xmath0 according to their corresponding production channels or due to diffusions into mid - rapidity region , but changes slightly for @xmath43 gev / c . for even heavier particle , like @xmath26",

    "4(d ) , the ratio @xmath2(@xmath24)/@xmath2(@xmath22 ) from the default ampt model also agrees very well with experimental data .",
    "we note that the present calculation without including the possible quark intrinsic @xmath0 broadening at initial state can not reproduce the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath2 .",
    "this difference between data and model results may indicate that the initial state effect is important .",
    "the year 2008 data of rhic with higher statistics will provide more precise measurements and test our predictions for other hadron species like @xmath14 meson , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , etc .    for comparisons , the @xmath2 from string melting ampt with quark coalescence",
    "is also studied .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "2(c ) that the excess of @xmath29 quark over @xmath45 quark at mid - rapidity is partly due to associate production from initial multiple interactions . combining this effect with the coalescence of partons , there are enhancements of corresponding hadrons at intermediate @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath2 values for different particle species that contain different number of @xmath29-quarks are shown in fig .",
    "note , multi - strange hadrons are particularly interesting as they suffer much less hadronic interactions @xcite compared with non - strange hadrons .",
    "therefore they are more sensitive to early stage dynamics . at intermediate @xmath0",
    ", there is an enhancement of @xmath2 according to the number of @xmath29 quarks , that is , @xmath46 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath2 for strange particles ( @xmath27 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 ) are close to each other ( not shown here ) at the same transverse momentum region .",
    "if one assumes the validity of the coalescence approach , this observation shows that the measured @xmath2 can , to some extend , reflect the density of quarks shortly before the freeze - out .",
    "however , from the coalescence calculation the @xmath2 of antiproton is close to that of @xmath22 at intermediate @xmath0 , which is not consistent with experimental data , as shown in fig .",
    "in summary , we studied the mechanism of hadron formation and subsequent interactions in @xmath1+au collisions at @xmath4 = 200 gev . in a multiphase transport model with lund string fragmentation for hadronization and",
    "the subsequent hadronic rescatterings included , we find particle mass dependence of central - to - peripheral nuclear modification factor @xmath2 .",
    "recent data on particle species dependence of @xmath2 at mid - rapidity for @xmath1+au collisions at rhic can be understood in terms of this final - state hadronic rescatterings .",
    "this shows the importance of final state hadronic interactions in @xmath1+au collisions , since none of the initial - state models would predict a species - dependent @xmath2 at present .",
    "however , the calculations can not reproduce the @xmath0 dependence of @xmath2 with only final state interactions , this indicates the initial state effects might be also important .",
    "issues associated with the initial condition such as gluon saturation @xcite , parton intrinsic @xmath0 broadening @xcite and so on were not addressed in this paper .",
    "the future more complete analysis should include these effects . in comparison ,",
    "if the hadron is formed from quark coalescence , it is difficult to explain antiproton transverse momentum spectra and the particle species dependence of @xmath2 . on the other hand",
