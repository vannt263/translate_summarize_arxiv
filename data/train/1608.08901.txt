    "the phenomenon of many - body localisation  @xcite ( mbl ) refers to the breakdown of ergodicity in generic , disordered many - body systems due to quantum effects .",
    "this is a striking counterexample to the fundamental assumptions of statistical mechanics about the thermalization of an isolated system . for any non - integrable , classical many - body hamiltonian system ,",
    "the dynamics is ergodic in phase space leading eventually to thermalization . in classical mechanics",
    "this occurs even for systems close to integrability via arnold diffusion , a phenomenon strictly related to the celebrated kam theorem  @xcite . in quantum systems",
    "there is a striking exception : destructive interference between matter waves forbids a system in the mbl phase to thermalize .",
    "quantum effects make the system non - ergodic : no part of it acts as reservoir for the rest of the system .    the existence of mbl is astonishing at first sight : due to presence of interactions one expects the quantum system to be non - integrable and to show ergodicity and thermalization  @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is however strange only apparently : it has been shown that a system in the mbl phase can be mapped to an integrable system with an extensive number of local integrals of motion  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , integrable systems are isolated points in the space of hamiltonians , both from a classical  @xcite and a quantum  @xcite perspective ; in mbl , on the opposite , integrability and non - ergodicity properties do not require any fine tuning .",
    "remarkably , mbl has been recently conjectured even in systems without disorder  @xcite : the contrast with the behaviour of classical systems is even more striking .    in some sense , the mbl phase is the continuation of the anderson localised ( al ) phase  @xcite of non - interacting particles when interaction is turned on : the two phases share several properties , mainly the absence of transport of any physical quantity . at the same time mbl has distinct features that make it qualitatively different from anderson localisation . from one side , while transport is frozen , correlations can still propagate in the mbl phase .",
    "this gives rise to a non - trivial dynamics of entanglement which is absent in the al phase and which we will better discuss later . from the other",
    ", the transition to the mbl phase does not emerge in thermodynamic quantities , but rather in transport and time - correlation functions .",
    "it is a _ dynamical _ transition and therefore we need appropriate observables to identify it .",
    "these very special properties have been recognised thanks to a constantly growing theoretical activity whose aims are elucidating the distinguishing features of mbl and finding the ways to detect them in experiments .",
    "several works have characterised the mbl phase by absence of transport of charge , spin or mass  @xcite or energy@xcite ; emergent , robust integrability  @xcite ; logarithmically slow but unbounded growth of entanglement  @xcite ; a peculiarly sparse structure of eigenfunctions @xcite ; the behaviour of observables after a quantum quench  @xcite ; the persistence of area law for entanglement to arbitrary temperatures and for eigenstates of arbitrary energy in the spectrum  @xcite , and the ability to protect discrete symmetries  @xcite even at infinite temperature . a comprehensive description of this activity can be found in the reviews  @xcite .    at the same time",
    "several different proposals were put forward in order to experimentally detect mbl . the interferometric probe based on coherent spin manipulations  @xcite , the search for revivals of the magnetization  @xcite or the temporal fluctuations around stationary values of local observables  @xcite are some of the examples .",
    "the intense theoretical efforts of the last decade stimulated an exciting race towards its experimental verification .",
    "last year the first beautiful experiments providing evidence of mbl appeared in cold atomic systems  @xcite and trapped ions  @xcite .",
    "however , it is still debatable if unique features of mbl which are not present in al systems have been observed : experiments have focused on propagation of particles which are frozen in both phases",
    ". it would be highly desirable to have a direct experimental test discriminating between these two cases and to have a direct probe of the dephasing mechanism of the mbl phase . from a theoretical perspective",
    ", several different observables / protocols have been proposed to this aim ( see above ) , but , in many cases , they are difficult to implement experimentally .",
    "purpose of this paper is to overcome these difficulties : we analyse in detail a probe of mbl which is able to discriminate it from the al phase and is experimentally accessible , within the existing technology . in the rest of the paper we are going to show that this probe is the two - site entanglement .",
    "the dynamics of two - site entanglement was recently measured in optical lattices and in trapped ions respectively in  @xcite and  @xcite . in the experiment of fukuhara _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , a system of atoms governed by a bose - hubbard hamiltonian was considered .",
    "the spins of the atoms are initially in a ferromagnetic phase : after flipping a spin at a given site ( local quench protocol ) , the entanglement between neighbouring spins is measured as a function of time .",
    "as we are going to discuss in detail , we consider a slight modification of this quench protocol , the one implemented in  @xcite . using this protocol , and measuring both imbalance and two - site entanglement , we will be able to extract the key properties of mbl phase .",
    "in particular , we will be able to find clear differences of the mbl phase and the the al phase in the measure of the two - site entanglement .",
    "entanglement plays an important role in mbl . while transport ( of energy , spin , mass or other macroscopically conserved quantities ) is frozen both in the mbl and al cases , quantum correlations can still propagate in the mbl phase , giving rise to entanglement between distant sites of the system . in this context , the mapping of any mbl system to an integrable system with an extensive number of local integrals of motion is crucial .",
    "thanks to this mapping , even in absence of transport , when the _ populations _ in every site are stationary , it can be shown that the _ coherences _ of distant sites evolve in a non - trivial way ( more details are in section  [ lbit - model ] ) .",
    "this phenomenon is defined as many - body dephasing : it is the ultimate responsible for an unbounded ( but slow ) growth of the entanglement entropy .",
    "the situation in the al phase is very different . in this case , the propagation of correlations and the entanglement growth stop after a while : entanglement properties give indeed a clear signature of mbl .    several studies ( see e.g.  @xcite ) show the evolution of the entanglement entropy of large blocks in disordered spin chains .",
    "the logarithmic growth of the entropy  @xcite , intimately related to the existence of an extensive number of local integrals of motions , has been identified as a unique trait of mbl . however , despite recent very interesting progresses  @xcite , block entanglement entropy is very hard to be measured in a many - body context ( virtually impossible on increasing the size of the block ) .",
    "on the opposite , the two - site entanglement we are considering is directly accessible in a cold - atoms experiment .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce the model and the quench protocol we are going to simulate .",
    "both are chosen to be essentially identical to those implemented in the experiment  @xcite .",
    "the two - site entanglement will be quantified through the concurrence defined in section  [ concu ] .",
    "section  [ results ] contains the results of our density matrix renormalisation group simulations .",
    "they show that the mbl phase is characterised by a typical power - law decay of the concurrence .",
    "this behaviour strongly contrasts with al where the concurrence reaches a non - vanishing stationary value ; it is also very different from the ergodic phase , where the concurrence abruptly vanishes after a short transient .",
    "we are able to study how the al phase is reached as a vanishing - interaction limit of the mbl : the power - law decay of the concurrence starts after a stationary , metastable , plateau whose extension in time diverges as a power law when the interaction vanishes . in section  [ lbit - model ] , we will show that the power - law decay of the concurrence is reproduced by a phenomenological integrable model of interacting qubits ( the so - called `` @xmath0-bit model '' ) : this is in agreement with the fact that our mbl system can be mapped over an integrable system .",
    "in section  [ bound ] , we will discuss a number of additional effects ( the role of number fluctuations , finite temperature , control of laser pulses ) that may arise when extracting the entanglement from experimental data .",
    "in the same section we will show that a ( more easily measurable ) bound to the concurrence exists : it gives very accurate results and faithfully reproduces the essential phenomenology .",
    "finally , section  [ conclusions ] is devoted to our conclusions and perspectives of future work .",
    "the model we consider is a generalisation of the aubry - andr model  @xcite .",
    "it can be realised in a two - species bose - hubbard model in the presence of a periodic potential incommensurate with the lattice spacing .",
    "this kind of potential is also defined as quasi - periodic , pseudo - random or aubry - andr potential . in the limit in which the on - site interaction is dominant with respect to the hopping , fluctuations in the number of particles in each site are frozen .",
    "it is then possible to derive an effective hamiltonian in the sub - space in which the occupation is one particle per site . here",
    "the dynamics is governed by an spin-1/2 @xmath1 hamiltonian  @xcite where the two eigenstates of @xmath2 represent the occupation of the @xmath3th site by one of the two species . in the presence of aubry - andr potential",

    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) is due to the external quasi - periodic on - site potential : the coupling strength appears as the parameter @xmath7 , the inverse of the incommensurate wavelength as the irrational number @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a phase .",

    "the external potential appears as a quasi - periodic chemical potential of amplitude @xmath7 .",
    "the existence of a mbl phase in this model was rigorously established in ref .",
    "[ ]    in the non - interacting case ( @xmath15 ) , when the amplitude @xmath7 of the quasi - periodic potential overcomes a threshold @xmath16 , the system undergoes a transition from an ergodic to an al phase  @xcite",
    ". this transition has been recently observed in an experiment on cold atoms  @xcite .",
    "the interacting case ( @xmath17 ) presents three distinct phases , depending on the choice of the coupling constants : ergodic , mbl and al phases .",
    "although an accurate analysis of the phase diagram is not the aim of this work , we need to identify the parameters leading to the different phases . to this aim",
    "we have performed an analysis of the different phases , without however dwelling on the precise location of the phase boundaries . the resulting ( approximate ) phase diagram in the @xmath18 plane",
    "is reported in appendix  [ diagram ] .    in order to detect signatures of the mbl in the two - site entanglement , we will study its time - dependence after a quantum quench .",
    "the protocol we consider is the same as in ref .",
    "we start initialising the system in the nel state @xmath19 then , we follow its time evolution governed by the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( therefore we will work in the subspace with total conserved spin @xmath20 ) .",
    "we average the quantities of interest over many realisations of pseudo - disorder , through a random sampling of the phase @xmath9 in the on - site pseudo - random potential . through the rest of the paper",
    ", we will fix the inverse wavelength of the quasi - random potential as @xmath21 .",
    "we make this choice because this is the better approximation to an irrational number which can be done in the experiments ( it is the one used in ref .  [ ] ) .",
    "we further set @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "in the model defined in eq . , the entanglement between two - sites can be quantified through the concurrence  @xcite .",
    "we start our analysis defining the concurrence between two sites in a system of interacting spin-@xmath24 , like the one in eq .  .",
    "we consider two sites of the system , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and we define @xmath27 as the reduced density matrix describing the subsystem formed by these two sites . we remind the reader that the concurrence @xmath28 of two spins is a measure of the entanglement of the two spins minimised over all the possible decompositions of the matrix @xmath29 with arbitrary states @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    for two spins , with this definition",
    ", the concurrence between @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be shown to be @xmath32 , where @xmath33 are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the product matrix @xmath34 , taken in descending order .",
    "the spin flipped matrix @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 ( where @xmath37 are the pauli operators ) .",
    "if @xmath38 it means that there is a decomposition of the reduced density matrix @xmath27 in which all the states @xmath39 are separable .",
    "the concurrence has been employed several times to analyse many - body systems ( see  [ ] for a review ) .",
    "here we are going to show that its dynamics is able to distinguish between the ergodic , the mbl and the al phases .    in the case we are considering , the @xmath40 component @xmath41 of the total spin",
    "is conserved : if we express the reduced density matrix for sites @xmath25 , @xmath26 in the @xmath40-basis , we find a particularly simple block - diagonal form @xmath42 where @xmath43 \\rangle\\ , \\nonumber   \\label{spin - spin}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( analogous expressions can be also written in the fermionic representation ) .",

    "it is important to keep in mind this observation in view of the analysis that will be presented in section  [ bound ] of this paper .    because of the incommensurate potential , the concurrence ( as well as other observables ) will be site - dependent . to overcome this difficulty",
    ", we choose to analyse a single expression containing information on all the pairs of sites : it is the quasi - disorder average of the square concurrence summed over the sites .",
    "@xmath47 the bar indicates the quasi - disorder average which is performed over different realisations of @xmath9 ; in order to avoid finite - size effects from the edges , we restrict to the bulk the sum over @xmath25 , @xmath26 . precisely , we consider @xmath48 .",
    "the quantity we have defined allows to discuss in a compact way the results for the two - site entanglement .",
    "moreover ( together with the 1-tangle ) it allows to extract some information on the residual multi - partite entanglement of the two selected sites  @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of this quantity reflects also the so - called monogamy properties of entanglement : a given spin can not be highly entangled with more than one other spin in the system .",
    "we will see that monogamy is useful to understand the results of this paper . for simplicity , in the rest of the presentation we will refer to the quantity @xmath49 in eq . as the concurrence .",
    "the two - site entanglement is contained in the reduced two - site density matrix , and consequently can be expressed through the different spin - spin correlations ( see eqs . ) .",
    "the temporal fluctuations around the stationary values of local , as well as two - spin observables , were shown to decay as power laws  @xcite . despite providing a good insight about the dynamics , a direct relation between the behaviour of the fluctuations and the concurrence can not be drawn because the entanglement results in a complicate function of the correlators .",
    "in general it has been shown that in most case the two - site entanglement is not directly related to the properties of correlation functions  @xcite .",
    "complementary to the entanglement analysis , we also study the time evolution of the imbalance in the occupation between even ( e ) and odd ( o ) sites  @xcite . in the particle representation , this is the difference in the occupation of even and odd sites @xmath50 ; in the spin representation it is defined as @xmath51 the imbalance has been measured experimentally  @xcite : it has been observed that it tends asymptotically to a non - vanishing stationary value , both in the mbl and al phases . as we are going to show , analysing the time - dependence of the imbalance and of the concurrence , we can distinguish between the three different phases .",
    "more importantly , we can also capture the subtle dephasing mechanisms occurring in the mbl phase .",
    "this section will be entirely devoted to the discussion of the outcomes of our simulations of the dynamics of the concurrence and the imbalance . in all the simulations discussed in this section ,",
    "we initially prepare the system in the state @xmath52 ( see eq .  ) and we study its subsequent evolution . to better compare with the existing results on the relation between many - body dephasing and growth of entanglement , we will also compare our results to the behaviour of the entropy .",
    "the message we would like to convey is that the signatures of mbl that emerge in the entanglement entropy are evident also in the two - site entanglement , but the last object has the important advantage of being easier to access in an experiment .",

    "could not be distinguished from zero in the scale of the plot .",

    "starting from the factorized state eq .  , the short - time ( @xmath67 ) increase of entanglement is almost independent of @xmath7 and it is essentially due to the exchange coupling terms ( the hopping in the fermion language ) in eq .  .",

    "moreover , in this asymptotic regime , the spin dynamics is frozen and the mbl dephasing takes place .",
    "therefore , the power law decay in the al phase and the one in the mbl phase are different phenomena which have to be distinguished from each other : the first one is a transient effect occurring before the entanglement and spin dynamics freeze , the second one is an asymptotic phenomenon occurring when the spin dynamics has already frozen .",
    "another clear difference with the mbl phase emerges also in the decay of the concurrence to its long - time limit : apparently the exponent of the power law does not depend on the disorder strength ( see fig.-(top ) ) ; we are going to see that the power law decay in the mbl phase behaves very differently .",

    "outlined in the introduction , the spin dynamics in the mbl phase is frozen but correlations evolve in time due to a many - body dephasing phenomenon which is connected to the existence of an extensive number of local integrals of motion .",

    "we will discuss in detail this dephasing mechanism in section  [ lbit - model ] .",
    "the important new ingredient is that two - site entanglement is  easy \" to measure . the comparison of fig .",

    "the results we presented are for the average of the two - site entanglement ; its statistics is expected to be very interesting as well .",
    "it is known from perturbative constructions of the integrals of motion @xcite that the mechanism for delocalisation ( and in general for mixing distant spins with a local spin ) is to construct long non - local operators which  at a variance with respect to the al case  are not simply bilinear in the raising and lowering operators .",
    "therefore the dynamics of one spin gets mixed with a line of spins of length @xmath78 which is the mbl localisation length . in this way ,",
