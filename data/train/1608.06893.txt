    "a quantitative investigation of cohesive fracture propagation necessitates an accurate description of various fracture phenomena including : crack initiation ; propagation along complex three - dimensional paths ; interaction and coalescence of distributed multi - cracks into localized continuous cracks ; and interaction of fractured / unfractured material .",
    "the classical finite element ( fe ) method , although it has been used with some success to address some of these aspects , is inherently incapable of modeling the displacement discontinuities associated with fracture . to address this issue ,",
    "advanced computational technologies have been developed in the recent past .",
    "first , the embedded discontinuity methods ( edms ) were proposed to handle displacement discontinuity within finite elements . in these methods",
    "the crack is represented by a narrow band of high strain , which is embedded in the element and can be arbitrarily aligned .",
    "many different edm formulations can be found in the literature and a comprehensive comparative study of these formulations appears in reference @xcite .",
    "the most common drawbacks of edm formulations are stress locking ( spurious stress transfer between the crack surfaces ) , inconsistency between the stress acting on the crack surface and the stress in the adjacent material bulk , and mesh sensitivity ( crack path depending upon mesh alignment and refinement ) .",
    "a method that does not experience stress locking and reduces mesh sensitivity is the extended finite element method ( x - fem ) .",
    "x - fem , first introduced by belytschko & black @xcite , exploits the partition of unity property of fe shape functions .",
    "this property enables discontinuous terms to be incorporated locally in the displacement field without the need of topology changes in the initial uncracked mesh .",
    "mos et al .",
    "@xcite enhanced the primary work of belytschko et al .",
    "@xcite through including a discontinuous enrichment function to represent displacement jump across the crack faces away from the crack tip .",
    "x - fem has been successfully applied to a wide variety of problems .",
    "dolbow et .",
    "@xcite applied xfem to the simulation of growing discontinuity in mindlin - reissner plates by employing appropriate asymptotic crack - tip enrichment functions .",
    "belytschko and coworkers @xcite modeled evolution of arbitrary discontinuities in classical finite elements , in which discontinuity branching and intersection modeling are handled by the virtue of adding proper terms to the related finite element displacement shape functions .",
    "furthermore , they studied crack initiation and propagation under dynamic loading condition and used a criterion based on the loss of hyperbolicity of the underlying continuum problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite extended x - fem to the simulation of cohesive crack propagation .",
    "the main drawbacks of x - fem are that the implementation into existing fe codes is not straightforward , the insertion of additional degrees of freedoms is required on - the - fly to describe the discontinuous enrichment , and complex quadrature routines are necessary to integrate discontinuous integrands .",
    "another approach widely used for the simulation of cohesive fracture is based on the adoption of cohesive zero - thickness finite elements located at the interface between the usual finite elements that discretize the body of interest @xcite .",
    "this method , even if its implementation is relatively simple , tends to be computationally intensive because of the large number of nodes that are needed to allow fracturing at each element interface .",
    "furthermore , in the elastic phase the zero - thickness finite elements require the definition of an artificial penalty stiffness to ensure inter - element compatibility .",
    "this stiffness usually deteriorates the accuracy and rate of convergence of the numerical solution and it may cause numerical instability . to avoid this problem , algorithms have been proposed in the literature @xcite for the dynamic insertion of cohesive fractures into fe meshes .",
    "the dynamic insertion works reasonably well in high speed dynamic applications but is not adequate for quasi - static applications and leads to inaccurate stress calculations along the crack path .",
    "an attractive alternative to the aforementioned approaches is the adoption of discrete models ( particle and lattice models ) , which replace the continuum a priori by a system of rigid particles that interact by means of linear / nonlinear springs or by a grid of beam - type elements .",
    "these models were first developed to describe the behavior of particulate materials @xcite and to solve elastic problems in the pre - computers era @xcite .",
    "later , they have been adapted to simulate fracture and failure of quasi - brittle materials in both two @xcite and three dimensional problems @xcite . in this class of models ,",
    "it is worth mentioning the rigid - body - spring model developed by bolander and collaborators , which dicretizes the material domain using voronoi diagrams with random geometry , interconnected by zero - size springs , to simulate cohesive fracture in two and three dimensional problems @xcite .",
    "various other discrete models , in the form of either lattice or particle models , have been quite successful recently in simulating concrete materials @xcite .",
    "discrete models can realistically simulate fracture propagation and fragmentation without suffering from the aforementioned typical drawbacks of other computational technologies .",
    "the effectiveness and the robustness of the method are ensured by the fact that : a ) their kinematics naturally handle displacement discontinuities ; b ) the crack opening at a certain point depends upon the displacements of only two nodes of the mesh ; c ) the constitutive law for the fracturing behavior is vectorial ; d ) remeshing of the material domain or inclusion of additional degrees of freedom during the fracture propagation process is not necessary . despite these advantages",
    "the general adoption of these methods to simulate fracture propagation in continuous media has been quite limited because of various drawbacks in the uncracked phase , including : 1 ) the stiffness of the springs is defined through a heuristic ( trial - and - error ) characterization ; 2 ) various elastic phenomena , e.g. poisson s effect , can not be reproduced exactly ; 3 ) the convergence of the numerical scheme to the continuum solution can not be proved ; 4 ) amalgamation with classical tensorial constitutive laws is not possible ; and 5 ) spurious numerical heterogeneity of the response ( not related to the internal structure of the material ) is inherently associated with these methods if simply used as discretization techniques for continuum problems .",
    "the discontinuous cell method ( dcm ) presented in this paper provides a framework unifying discrete models and continuum based methods .",
    "the delaunay triangulation is employed to discretize the solid domain into triangular elements , the voronoi tessellation is then used to build a set of discrete polyhedral cells whose kinematics is described through rigid body motion typical of discrete models .",
    "tonti @xcite presented a somewhat similar approach to discretize the material domain and to compute the finite element nodal forces using dual cell geometries .",
    "furthermore , the dcm formulation is similar to that of the discontinuous galerkin method which has primarily been applied in the past to the solution of fluid dynamics problems , but has also been extended to the study of elasticity @xcite .",
    "recently , discontinuous galerkin approaches have also been used for the study of fracture mechanics @xcite and cohesive fracture propagation @xcite .",
    "the dcm formulation can be considered as a discontinuous galerkin approach which utilizes piecewise constant shape functions .",
    "another interesting feature of dcm is that the formulation includes rotational degrees of freedom .",
    "researchers have attempted to introduce rotational degrees of freedom to classical finite elements by considering special form of displacement functions along each element edge to improve their performance in bending problems @xcite .",
    "this strategy leads often to zero energy deformation modes and to singular element stiffness matrix even if the rigid body motions are constrained .",
    "dcm formulation simply incorporates nodal rotational degrees of freedom , without suffering from the aforementioned problem .",
    "equilibrium , compatibility , and constitutive laws for cauchy continua can be formulated as limit case of the governing equations for cosserat continua in which displacements and rotations are assumed to be independent fields but the couple stress tensor is identically zero @xcite . for small deformations and for any position vector @xmath0 in the material domain @xmath1 , one has @xmath2 and @xmath3    in the above equations , the summation rule of repeated indices applies ; @xmath4 and @xmath5 are displacement and rotation fields , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 is the strain tensor ; @xmath7 is the stress tensor ; @xmath8 are body forces per unit volume ; @xmath9 is the mass density .",
    "subscripts @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 represent components of cartesian coordinate system which can be @xmath13 in three dimensional problems ; @xmath14 is the levi - civita permutation symbol .",
    "considering any position dependent field variable such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 represent partial derivative of @xmath17 with respect to the @xmath10th component of the coordinate system , while @xmath18 is the time derivative of the variable .",
    "the partial differential equations above need to be complemented by appropriate boundary conditions that can either involve displacements , @xmath19 on @xmath20 ( essential boundary conditions ) ; or tractions , @xmath21 on @xmath22 ( natural boundary conditions ) ; where @xmath23 is the boundary of the solid volume @xmath1 .    in the elastic regime ,",
    "the constitutive equations can be written as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the volumetric strain ; @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the volumetric and deviatoric moduli that can be expressed through young s modulus @xmath28 and poisson s ratio @xmath29 : @xmath30 ; @xmath31 .",
    "it is worth observing that since the solution of the problem formulated above requires the stress tensor to be symmetric ( see second equation in equation [ eq : equilibrium-2 ] ) , the constitutive equations imply the symmetry of the strain tensor as well , which , in turn leads to displacements and rotations to be related through the following expression : @xmath32    the weak form of the equilibrium equations can be obtained through the principle of virtual work ( pvw ) as @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are arbitrary strains , displacements , and rotations , respectively , satisfying compatibility equations with homogeneous essential boundary conditions .",
    "it must be observed here that the pvw in equation [ pvw ] is the weak formulation of both linear and angular momentum balances .",
    "hence , the symmetry of the stress tensor and , consequently , the symmetry of the strain tensor are imposed in average sense .",
    "this is a significant difference compared to classical formulations for cauchy continua in which the symmetry of the stress tensor is assumed `` a priori '' .",
    "let us consider a three - dimensional _ primal cell complex _ , which , according to the customary terminology in algebraic topology @xcite , is a subdivision of the three - dimensional space @xmath37 through sets of vertices ( 0-cells ) , edges ( 1-cells ) , faces ( 2-cells ) , and volumes ( 3-cells ) .",
    "next let us construct a _ dual cell complex _ anchored to the primal .",
    "this can be achieved , for example , by associating a primal 3-cell with a dual 0-cell , a primal 2-cell with a dual 1-cell , etc .",
    "the primal / dual complex obtained through the delaunay triangulation of a set of points and its associated voronoi tessellation is a very popular choice in many fields of study for its ability to discretize complex geometry and it is adopted in this study .",
    "let us consider a material domain @xmath1 and discretize it into tetrahedral elements by using the centroidal delaunay tetrahedralization , and the associated voronoi tessellation which leads to a system of polyhedral cells @xcite .",
    "figure [ dcmgeom3d]a , shows a typical tetrahedral element with the volume @xmath38 , external boundary @xmath39 , and oriented surfaces @xmath40 located within the volume .",
    "the interior oriented surfaces @xmath40 are derived from the voronoi tessellation and are hereinafter called  facets \" . in 3d ,",
    "the facets are triangular areas of contact between adjacent polyhedral cells . in the voronoi tessellation procedure ,",
    "the triangular facets @xmath40 are perpendicular to the element edges @xmath39 , which is a crucial feature of dcm formulation as it will be shown later , and their geometry is such that one node of each facet is placed in the middle of the tetrahedral element edge , one is located on one of the triangular faces of the tetrahedral element , and one is located inside the tetrahedral element . as a result , each tetrahedral element contains twelve facets in a 3d setting , figure [ dcmgeom3d]a .",
    "figure [ dcmgeom3d]b illustrates a portion of the tetrahedral element associated with one of its four nodes @xmath41 and the corresponding facets . combining such portions from all the tetrahedral elements connected to the same node ,",
    "one obtains the corresponding voronoi cell .",
    "each node in the 3d dcm formulation has six degrees of freedom , three translational and three rotational , which are shown in figure [ dcmgeom3d]b . the same figure depicts , for a generic facet , three unit vectors , one normal @xmath42 and two tangential ones @xmath43 and @xmath44 , defining a local system of reference . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "the facet index @xmath17 is dropped when possible to simplify notation .",
    "the dcm approximation is based on the assumptions that displacement and rotation fields can be approximated by the rigid body kinematics of each voronoi cell , that is @xmath45 where @xmath46 , @xmath47 are displacements and rotations of node @xmath48 ; @xmath49 is the volume of the cell associated with node @xmath48 .",
    "obviously with this approximating displacement and rotation functions , strain versus displacement / rotation relationships in equations [ eq : compatibility-1 ] can not be enforced locally  as typically done in displacement based finite element formulation .",
    "let us consider a generic node @xmath48 of spatial coordinates @xmath50 and the adjacent nodes @xmath51 of spatial coordinates @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the vector connecting the two nodes .",
    "one can write @xmath54 in which @xmath55 is a unit vector in the direction of @xmath53 .",
    "note that , to simplify notation the two indices @xmath48 and @xmath51 are dropped when supposed to appear together . without loss of generality , let us also assume that node @xmath48 is located on the negative side of the facets whereas node @xmath51 is located on the positive side of the associated facet oriented through its normal unit vector @xmath56 .",
    "moreover , it is useful to introduce the vector @xmath57 connecting node @xmath48 to a generic point p on the facet .",
    "the displacement jump at point p reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are the values of displacements on the positive and negative side of the facet , respectively ; @xmath61 ; @xmath62 ; @xmath63 ; and @xmath64 , @xmath65 are magnitude and direction of vector @xmath66 .",
    "equation [ eq : strain1 ] can be rewritten in tensorial notation as @xmath67    by expanding the displacement and the rotation fields in taylor series around @xmath50 and by truncating the displacement to the second order and the rotation to the first , one obtains @xmath68    by projecting the displacement jump @xmath69 in the direction orthogonal to the facet and dividing it by the element edge length @xmath70 , one can write    @xmath71    where @xmath6 is the strain tensor . at convergence",
    "the discretization size tends to zero ( @xmath72 ) and one can write @xmath73 . furthermore , if the dual complex adopted for the volume discretization is such that the facets are orthogonal to the element edges  this condition is verified , for example , by the delaunay - voronoi complex  then , @xmath74 , and one has @xmath75 : the normal component of the displacement jump normalized with the element edge length represents the projection of the strain tensor onto the facet . similarly , it can be shown that the components of the displacement jump tangential to the facets can be expressed as @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    before moving forward ,",
    "a few observations are in order .",
    "since the facet are flat the unit vector @xmath78 is the same for any point belonging to a given facet and the projection of the strain tensor is uniform over each facet for a uniform strain field .",
    "the variation of the displacement jump over the facet is due to the curvature and it is an high order effect that can be neglected ( see the last term in equation [ eq : disjumpn ] ) . based on the previous observation one can conclude that the analysis of the interaction of two adjacent nodes can be based on the average displacement jump which , given the linear distribution of the jump , can be calculated as the displacement jump , @xmath79 , at the centroid of the facet c. this leads naturally to the following definition of `` facet strains '' : @xmath80 and @xmath81 equations [ eq : eps - n ] and [ eq : eps - ml ] show that the `` facet strains '' correspond to the projection of the strain tensor onto the facet local system of reference .    let us now consider a uniform hydrostatic stress / strain state in one element @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "in this case the tractions on each facet must correspond to the volumetric stress and energetic consistency requires that @xmath84 which gives @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the set of facets belonging to one element . by using equation [ eq : eps - v ] and equations [ eq : eps - n ] , [ eq : eps - ml ] ,",
    "facet deviatoric strains can also be calculated as @xmath87 .    by introducing equation [ eq : disp - approx ] into equations [ eq : eps - n ] and [ eq : eps - ml ]",
    "one can also write    @xmath88    @xmath89    @xmath90    where @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , and @xmath97 , @xmath98 are vectors connecting the facet centroid c with nodes @xmath48 , @xmath51 , respectively .",
    "for the adopted discretized kinematics in which all deformability is concentrated at the facets , the pvw in equation [ pvw ] can be rewritten as    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the set of all facets in the domain .    by introducing equations [ eq : disp - approx ] , [ eq : eps - n - new ] , [ eq : eps - m - new ] , and [ eq : eps - l - new ] into equation [ eq : equi - weak - discrete-0 ] and considering displacement and traction continuity at the inter - element interfaces",

    "note that the first term on the lhs of equation [ eq : equi - weak - discrete ] also includes the contribution of external tractions for cells located on the domain boundary .    since equation [ eq : equi - weak - discrete ] must be satisfied for any virtual variation @xmath105 and @xmath106 , it is equivalent to the following system of algebraic equations ( @xmath107 , @xmath108= total number of voronoi cells ) :    @xmath109    @xmath110    where @xmath111 = external force resultant , @xmath112 = mass , @xmath113 = first - order mass moments , @xmath114 = external moment resultant , @xmath115 = second - order mass moments , of cell @xmath48 .",
    "equations [ eq : cell - equilibrium-1 ] and [ eq : cell - equilibrium-2 ] coincides with the force and moment equilibrium equations for each voronoi cell .    note that @xmath116 and @xmath117 ( for uniform body force ) , if the vertex of the nodes of the delaunay discretization coincide with the mass centroid of the voronoi cells",
    "this is the case for all the cells in the interior of the mesh if a centroidal voronoi tessellation is adopted . also , in general , @xmath118 for @xmath119 , and this leads to a non - diagonal mass matrix .",
    "a diagonalized mass matrix can be obtained simply by discarding the non - diagonal terms .      in the dcm framework ,",
    "the constitutive equations are imposed at the facet level where the facet tractions need to be expressed as function of the facet strains . for elasticity , by projecting the tensorial constitutive equations reported in equation [ eq : const ] in the local system of reference of each facet , one has    @xmath120    @xmath121    @xmath122",
    "in order to pursue a two - dimensional implementation of dcm , let us consider a 2d delaunay - voronoi discretization as shown in figures [ dcmgeom]a and b. a generic triangle can be considered as the triangular base of a prismatic volume as shown in figure [ dcmgeom]c and characterized by 6 vertexes , 9 edges , 2 triangular faces , and 3 rectangular faces . by considering the voronoi vertexes on the two parallel triangular faces and face / edge points located at mid - thickness ( see , e.g. , points @xmath123 and @xmath64 ) a complete tessellation of the volume in six sub - volumes , one per vertex , can be obtained by triangular facets . of these facets ,",

    "one can write @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the out - of - plane thickness .    for plane strain conditions @xmath133 for the facet set @xmath130 and",
    "simply the second term in equation [ eq : eps - v-2d ] is zero . for plane stress , instead , @xmath134 for the facet set @xmath130 .",
    "therefore , for the facet set @xmath130 , @xmath135 and , also , @xmath136 .",
    "using these relations , one has @xmath137 . substituting this relation in equation [ eq : eps - v-2d ] leads to @xmath138 .",
    "in addition the facet set @xmath125 is composed by 3 sets of 4 planar triangular facets .",
    "for each set , strains and tractions are the same on the 4 facets because the response is uniform through the thickness .",

    "in addition , dcm is able to capture micro cracks developing from the main crack faces , as it can be seen in figures [ ecpf - damage ] and [ ecpc - damage ] , while this is not captured by other approaches .",
    "it is also worth noting that the computational cost of methods like xfem increases as the crack propagates because additional dofs must be inserted to capture the displacement discontinuity .",
    "this is not the case for dcm which is characterized by the same number of dofs in the elastic and fracturing regimes .",
    "a final benchmark fracture problem simulated by dcm in this section involves dynamic crack propagation and crack branching .",
    "figure [ branch - geom ] shows a schematic representation of the test configuration .",
    "a pre - notched rectangular panel is subjected to a uniform traction applied as a step function on the two edges parallel to the notch .",
    "this experiment has been simulated computationally by other authors @xcite , and related experimental results were reported by different researchers @xcite .",
    "ramulu and kobayashi @xcite observed experimentally that a major crack starts to propagate from the notch tip to the right , which branches into two cracks at a certain point during the experiment , see figure [ branch - geom ] for the sketch of the experimental result .",
    "the dcm parameters used in this test are : @xmath246 mpa , @xmath247 gpa ; material characteristic length @xmath248 m , which corresponds to a fracture energy of approximately 3 j / m@xmath218 ; material density @xmath249 @xmath232 ; poisson s ratio @xmath250 .",
    "the applied traction is @xmath251 mpa .",
    "crack initiation and propagation at different time steps of the dcm simulation is illustrated in figure [ branch - damage](a - e ) through the damage parameter contours .",
    "one can see that the crack starts to propagate from the notch tip parallel to the symmetry axis of the configuration on a straight path for a short distance , and it branches into two cracks subsequently .",
    "the deformed configuration of the dcm simulation is plotted in figure [ branch - damage]f , which agrees well with the experimental results .",
    "experimental observations also report that before the main branching occurs , minor branches emerge from the main crack but only propagate on a short distance @xcite .",
    "dcm is able to capture these minor branches which can be seen in the damage variable contours in figure [ branch - damage ] .",
    "dcm and classical particle models are basically governed by the same set of algebraic equations expressing compatibility and equilibrium .",
    "this naturally follows from the adoption of rigid body kinematics which is common to the two approaches .",
    "the difference between the two methods lies in the formulation of the constitutive law , namely in the relationship between facet tractions @xmath252 and facet openings @xmath253 . for classical particle models ,",
    "in which rigid particles are connected by springs , this relationship can be expressed as @xmath254 and @xmath255 , where @xmath256 and @xmath257 are the normal and tangential elastic stiffnesses , respectively .",
    "dcm constitutive laws , equation [ ntconstdamag ] , are consistent to the ones for particle models if one sets @xmath258 and @xmath259 .",
    "these conditions correspond to an elastic material with zero poisson s ratio @xcite . by properly setting the ratio between the normal and tangential stiffnesses",
    ", particle models can simulate an `` average '' non - zero poisson s  ratio ( average in the sense that poisson s ratio is defined by analyzing a finite , as opposed to an infinitesimal , volume of material ) . in this case , however , particle models feature an intrinsic heterogeneous response even for load configurations that produce uniform strain fields according to continuum theory @xcite . in conclusion , for non - zero poisson",
    "s ratio the two formulations are fundamentally different and the key difference is that dcm accounts for the orthogonality of the deviatoric and volumetric deformation modes while classical particle models do not .    it must be mentioned here that the heterogeneous response of particle models is not necessarily a negative property and , actually , it is critical for their ability to handle automatically strain localization and crack initiation @xcite . it must be kept in mind , however , that in this case the size of the discretization can not be user - defined but must be linked to the actual size of the material heterogeneity . only under this condition",
    "can one consider the heterogeneous response of particle models to be a representation of the actual internal behavior of the material rather than a spurious numerical artifact .",
    "in this paper , the formulation of the discontinuous cell method ( dcm ) has been outlined .",
    "a convergence study in the elastic regime shows that dcm converges to the exact continuum solution with a convergence rate that is comparable to that of constant strain finite elements , but with accuracy that is one order of magnitude higher .",
    "in addition , numerical simulations show that dcm , with a simple two parameter isotropic damage model , can simulate cohesive fracture propagation without the drawbacks of standard finite elements , such as spurious mesh sensitivity , and without the complications of most recently formulated computational techniques .",
    "in addition , dcm successfully simulated the crack branching which is observed in the experiment of a benchmark problem .",
    "finally , dcm can simulate the transition from localized fracture to fragmentation without mesh entanglement typical of finite element approaches .",
