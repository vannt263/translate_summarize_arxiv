    "the _ cuo@xmath11 _ plane based high  temperature superconductors have anomalous normal state properties .",
    "one part of the normal state puzzle involves the spin orderings , and for the majority of this paper we focus on the differing magnetic phase diagrams for the hole  doped bednorz ",
    "compounds @xcite in comparison to the electron  doped _ nd@xmath0ce@xmath1cuo@xmath2 _ materials @xcite . in particular , for both of these systems the @xmath12 phase possesses three  dimensional antiferromagnetic long  ranged order @xcite .",
    "however , one must heavily dope the @xmath13 compound to destroy this order , say @xmath14 12 % , while only a small doping of @xmath14 2 % is required to kill long  ranged antiferromagnetic order in the @xmath15 cuprate material .",
    "a schematic of the contrasting phase diagrams is given in fig .",
    "one important aspect of the magnetic orderings found in these systems involves the kinds of spin correlations that these systems exhibit when doped to levels greater than 2 % .",
    "as mentioned above , for the electron  doped material antiferromagnetic order persists until @xmath16 doping levels are reached .",
    "however , when the hole",
    " doped system has say 7 % holes in a _",
    "plane , short  ranged incommensurate magnetic ordering is found .",
    "this appears experimentally in the dynamic magnetic response , and has been found via inelastic neutron scattering for a number of intermediate doping levels @xcite .",
    "consequently , an alternate way in which one can phrase the question concerning the differing magnetic phase diagrams is : why does the electron ",
    "doped system maintain commensurate antiferromagnetic order at doping levels that induce incommensurate correlations in the hole ",
    "doped system ?",
    "several theories have addressed the phase diagrams of these doped antiferromagnetic insulators .",
    "when the _ la_-based system is doped , the carriers predominantly occupy _ o _ sites , in particular as _ o@xmath17 _ states , whereas for the _ nd_-based material the carriers are believed to be associated with the addition of an electron to a _ cu  3d  @xmath18 _ ion , thus forming _",
    "cu@xmath19_. then , a common explanation of these differing magnetic phase diagrams follows from the assumption of the complete localization of the carriers , and the ensuing spin distortions generated by such static defects .",
    "namely : ( i ) the dramatic reduction of the nel temperature @xmath20 in the hole ",
    "doped system results from frustrating ferromagnetic bonds being embedded in an antiferromagnetic background , the so  called aharony model @xcite .",
    "such frustrated bonds generate a long  ranged spin distortion with dipolar symmetry , and numerical studies @xcite have shown that a version of this perturbation renormalized by quantum fluctuations @xcite indeed alters the spin ",
    "spin correlation length in a fashion consistent with experiment @xcite .",
    "( ii ) fixed _ cu@xmath19 _ sites in a background antiferromagnetic lattice act like static vacancies , and subsequently diminish the spin  wave stiffness @xcite in a manner consistent with experiment @xcite .",
    "monte carlo studies of this quantum dilution problem @xcite do not suffer from the minus sign problem , and thus are capable of accurately characterizing the spin correlation length .",
    "unfortunately , these can not be complete explanations of the differing magnetic phase diagrams .",
    "near the antiferromagnetic phase boundary ( temperature vs. doping ) the carriers are mobile in both of these systems @xcite , and thus one must come to an understanding of the differing reductions of the spin orderings for mobile not just localized carriers .",
    "this is one of the focuses of this paper @xcite .",
    "here we put forward a proposal explaining the electron  hole asymmetry of the magnetic phase diagrams shown in fig . 1 for mobile carriers .",
    "our work builds on our earlier study @xcite that showed that for the @xmath21 model and the hole ",
    "doped system , a tendency towards short  ranged incommensurate order vs. hole doping arises .",
    "the results of @xcite are consistent with experiment @xcite , and in part is further verification of earlier exact diagonalization work of moreo et al .",
    "@xcite , as well as monte carlo work @xcite .",
    "however , the important point of @xcite was that this incommensurability only occurred for the single  hole system having a ground state momentum of @xmath22 ( since @xmath23 quasiparticles generate long  ranged spin distortions similar to those produced by a ferromagnetic bond , the success of the above  mentioned aharony model bodes well for any theory predicting that these carriers exist in the hole  doped 214 systems ) .",
    "if the momentum of the single  hole ground state is @xmath6 , something that may be accomplished through the use of the @xmath3 model ( see below ) with @xmath24 , then the tendency towards incommensurability is eliminated and only commensurate ordering remains .",
    "clearly , this is similar to the above  mentioned behaviour of the hole and electron  doped materials , and in this paper we will make this comparison complete .    very shortly after @xcite , tohyama and maekawa @xcite also studied the @xmath3 model , now for the electron and hole ",
    "doped systems .",
    "they suggested , consistent with a considerable amount of electronic structure work @xcite , as well as angle  resolved photoemission spectroscopy results for the electron ",
    "doped system @xcite , that the _ nd _ system corresponded to hopping integrals @xmath25 and @xmath26 with ( approximately ) just flipped signs in comparison to the same hopping integrals believed to be appropriate for the hole ",
    "doped materials ( we elaborate on this relation in the next section ) .",
    "then , by examining the energy to the first excited states , they demonstrated that the commensurate antiferromagnetic order was much more stable for the electron ",
    "doped system than for the hole ",
    "doped systems . as we show below",
    ", this is complimentary to our work in @xcite , since the single hole ground state momentum for their electron  doped @xmath3 hamiltonian is actually @xmath6 !",
    "we then strengthen the arguments of tohyama and maekawa by evaluating the magnetic structure factor @xmath7 for the many  carrier ground states for these two systems .",
    "indeed , using the relevant material parameters , we find incommensurate ordering tendencies for the hole ",
    "doped material , while for the electron  doped material the magnetic ordering is always commensurate , in complete agreement with experiment .",
    "we shall also be concerned with other physical properties of the hole and electron  doped materials . for the @xmath15 cuprates , some experiments",
    "can be explained beginning with the assumption that at low doping levels shraiman ",
    "siggia @xcite dipolar quasiparticles are present ( implicit in these theories is the existence of hole pockets , or a  small \" fermi surface , something that so far has not been observed ) .",
    "one such magnetic problem involves the scaling of the correlation length with doping and temperature , viz .",
    "@xmath5 , and this has been found to be reproduced by a model ( based on the existence of these dipolar quasiparticles ) proposed by one of us @xcite for both mobile and localized carriers , and is in close agreement with experiment @xcite .",
    "further , a theory @xcite of the temperature and doping dependent magnetic susceptibility @xmath27 has been found to be consistent with experiment @xcite .",
    "lastly , the same theory @xcite also predicts the existence of a pseudogap , something that may be consistent with experiment @xcite .",
    "we are proposing that these dipolar quasiparticles do not exist in the weakly  doped @xmath13 cuprates , and thus , e.g. , @xmath28 , and the optical properties of this system , may be quite different from those of the @xmath15 cuprates .",
    "unfortunately , the collection of experiments performed on the electron ",
    "doped materials is not as complete as the set performed for the hole ",
    "doped system , and so a full comparison is not possible .",
    "however , there is one striking difference between the normal state properties of these systems , and that is the resistivities at optimal doping .",
    "the @xmath15 system shows a linear@xmath29 resistivity @xcite , whereas the @xmath13 system shows a clear fermi ",
    "liquid  like @xmath30 dependence @xcite .",
    "another intriguing experimental result for the electron  doped material corresponds to the mid  gap states seen in the angle  integrated photoemission work of anderson @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that this is a signal of phase separation , and to this end we have examined the spatial distributions of many carriers , as well measured the interaction energies between carriers .",
    "our results tend to support a phase separation hypothesis , but _ only _ for the electron ",
    "doped system .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : ham ] we discuss the formal aspects of the @xmath32 model and display the electron ",
    "hole symmetries and asymmetries that can be identified when these materials are doped away from half filling . in ",
    "[ sec : numerics ] we summarize previously published and our recent exact diagonalization results for the one  carrier ground states for these two systems , and show that these two systems have different one  carrier ground states .",
    "then , the spin correlations found in @xmath7 as a function of doping are shown to be in agreement with the phase diagram of fig .",
    "1 . in   [ sec : analysis ] we examine the spin distortions produced by each of these quasiparticles via our semi  classical analysis of this hamiltonian for a single carrier ; this will be shown to agree with the exact diagonalization results .",
    "quantum fluctuations are shown to not affect these conclusions .",
    "then we examine the spatial distribution of carriers pointing out the acute difference between the hole and electron  doped systems  from this we relate the tendency towards clustering of carriers of the electron  doped system to the mid  gap states seen in photoemission . finally , in   [ sec : discussion ] we discuss the relevance of our results to the transport properties of both kinds of systems , and as a prelude to possible future work we consider the extrapolation of this approach to other systems , and in particular consider the commensurability that persists in the hole  doped @xmath33 system .",
    "we begin our discussion of the @xmath3 model by first considering a simpler model involving only hopping terms to the nearest and next nearest neighbour sites along a one  dimensional chain  this model provides the most direct demonstration of the electron ",
    "hole asymmetry about half filling that @xmath26 introduces into the problem .",
    "consider a linear chain with a single orbital per site , and define the vacuum to be the state with all orbitals devoid of electrons .",
    "introduce @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes nearest neighbours , @xmath38 next nearest neighbours , and @xmath39 is the electron annihilation operator for site @xmath40 and spin @xmath41 ( note that these operators are _ not _ constrained to prohibit double occupancy  see   [ sect : sch ] ) .",
    "then imagine that the system has an up spin at every site except one , at which no electron is present .",
    "the energy eigenvalues for this hole plus spin polarized background are given by @xmath42 now consider a system with up spins at every site , and that in addition to these electrons one down ",
    "spin electron is placed in some orbital .",
    "then the energy eigenvalues of this composite spin ",
    "polarized plus mobile electron system are @xmath43    from these results it is to be noted that while the near  neighbour hopping leads to identical energies for both the hole and electron  doped systems , the next  nearest  neighbour hopping has different signs .",
    "this reflects the breaking of electron  hole symmetry that @xmath26 induces , and thus its inclusion in our starting hamiltonian is crucial .",
    "it is to be stressed that this asymmetry is found in any dimension , for any spin background , but only for doping levels close to half filling",
    ".      equation  ( [ equation : hopping ] ) is not a good starting point for describing the physics of the @xmath44 planes in either @xmath45 or @xmath46 , since it only describes free carriers .",
    "if instead one begins with an extended hubbard model description @xcite of the strong correlation effects known to be present in these systems , and then examines the systems at close to half filling , one can obtain the so ",
    "called @xmath47 model @xcite . to be specific , one considers @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the heisenberg superexchange constant coupling spins @xmath50 between nearest  neighbour sites . also , in eq .",
    "( [ equation : ttpj ] ) constrained electron operators are used ( constrained to disallow double occupancy at any site ) , viz .",
    "we wish to stress that our use of the @xmath52 model is based on beginning with a three  band extended hubbard model description @xcite for _ both _ the @xmath45 and @xmath46 systems . while it is well known @xcite that for the hole  doped systems one may approximately map the three - band hubbard model onto the one  band @xmath3 model ( n.b .",
    " not necessarily the one  band hubbard model ) , it may be argued that this is also the correct starting point for the electron ",
    "doped systems .",
    "for example , the dominant contribution to the @xmath26 hopping integral for the electron doped system is _ not _ due to a direct @xmath53 overlap , but rather follows from a third  order @xmath54 hopping @xcite .",
    "thus , in what follows we consider ( i ) the @xmath25 and @xmath26 parameters that are to be _ fitted _ via quantum cluster studies ( see below ) , and not due to a strong  coupling mapping of the one  band hubbard model onto a hibert space prohibiting double occupancy @xcite , and ( ii ) the superexchange constant @xmath49 to be found from either quantum cluster studies , or from comparison to experiments probing the magnetic structure and/or excitations .    in the previous subsection we were able to treat hole and electron  doped systems with the same starting hamiltonian . however ,",
    "now it is clear that the above hamiltonian , for a vacuum corresponding to no electrons at any site , can not be used to describe both hole and electron doping of the half  filled state .",
    "for example , a vacancy can easily be added to a spin  polarized ferromagnetic state , and is completely mobile , while a down spin electron added to such a spin background is completely localized .",
    "consequently , with this hamiltonian and this vacuum , only hole  doped @xmath44 planes may be investigated .    to investigate the electron ",
    "doped system it is usual to introduce an electron  hole transformation , viz .",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the annihilation operator of a hole at site @xmath40 of spin @xmath41 .",
    "( with this transformation it follows that one now considers a vacuum with no holes at any site . ) however , this does not lead to the desired hamiltonian as one finds that the new hopping term does not describe constrained ( viz .",
    "two holes are never allowed on the same site ) hopping .",
    "instead , one must utilize a more general model than eq .",
    "( [ equation : ttpj ] ) , one that includes so  called doublon hopping processes @xcite , and from this starting hamiltonian it is straightforward to derive the required transformation .",
    "the result of this transformation can then be shown to be equivalent to @xmath57 where the @xmath58 also satisfy fermionic anti  commutation relations .",
    "thus , one eventually finds that the appropriate @xmath3 model for the electron ",
    "doped system is the same as eq .",
    "( [ equation : ttpj ] ) but with the @xmath58 replacing the @xmath59 _ and _ with the minus signs in front of @xmath25 and @xmath26 changed to be plus signs .    summarizing the above discussion",
    ", the @xmath3 hamiltonian will be used to model the physical systems that we are interested in .",
    "we consider this model to possess the bare minimum number of processes through which both the hole and electron  doped @xmath44 planes can be represented .",
    "to be specific , ( i ) eq .  ( [ equation : ttpj ] ) with a vacuum of zero electrons at every site of a square lattice will describe the hole ",
    "doped system , and ( ii ) for the electron  doped systems we use @xmath60 for this latter hamiltonian we use a vacuum of zero holes at every site of a square lattice . thus , note that , quite simply , in comparison to the hole ",
    "doped hamiltonian the signs of the @xmath25 and @xmath26 hopping terms are flipped and the @xmath61 operators replace the @xmath62 operators .",
    "thus , from now on we simply use eq .",
    "( [ equation : ttpj ] ) for both systems , specifying @xmath63 for hole doping , and @xmath64 for electron doping @xcite .",
    "we now consider the numerical values of the hopping and superexchange parameters .",
    "a consequence of the holes residing on the @xmath65 sites in the @xmath15 material is that for a quantitative determination of the hopping parameters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , something very different from overlap integrals must be evaluated .",
    "we refer the interested reader to the summary of this problem given by tohyama and maekawa @xcite , and simply state the range of accepted values @xcite . for the hole  doped @xmath45 system , using eq .",
    "( [ equation : ttpj ] ) , one may scale all energies such that @xmath63 .",
    "then one has @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "for the electron  doped @xmath46 system we again use eq .",
    "( [ equation : ttpj ] ) but now with @xmath68 , and @xmath66 and @xmath69 .",
    "thus , it is interesting to note that even though a zhang  rice singlet is not exactly equivalent to a @xmath70 ion , the material parameters for these two systems are such that the electron ",
    "hole mapping given in eq .",
    "( [ equation : eh2 ] ) predicts reasonably well the numerical values that one must employ for one system given the parameters of the other .",
    "stephan and horsch @xcite have proposed that knowledge of the single  hole system does not lead to valuable information on the multiply  doped state . in @xcite",
    "we showed that this is not always the case , and that , in particular , knowledge of the one  hole ground state can aid in predicting the presence / absence of incommensurate correlations .",
    "thus , we begin a discussion of our numerical work with a summary of the single  hole ground state .",
    "there has already been a comprehensive exact diagonalization study of the ground state of one hole in the @xmath3 model for a @xmath71 square cluster in ref .",
    "@xcite ( since they use a bosonic representation , their sign of @xmath26 is flipped in comparison to ours ) . for the physically relevant ratio of @xmath72 they find a @xmath73 ground state",
    "when the @xmath26 corresponding to hole ",
    "doped materials is used ( unless @xmath74 becomes too large ) , and a @xmath75 ground state for the @xmath26 associated with the electron ",
    "doped materials .",
    "we have used a lanczos routine and have also performed exact diagonalization evaluations @xcite of the ground states of the @xmath3 model for @xmath76 , with @xmath77 for @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "for the conventional @xmath71 16site square cluster our work agrees with that of ref .",
    "we have also studied the @xmath80 16site cluster introduced in @xcite , as well as some results generated using a @xmath81 24site cluster @xcite . for the hole  doped material , viz . when @xmath82 , we always find a ground state of @xmath22 , while for the electron  doped material , viz .",
    "when @xmath83 , we always @xcite find a ground state of @xmath84 .",
    "our results for these two different clusters are entirely consistent with the phase diagram of ref .",
    "@xcite found using the @xmath71 cluster .",
    "our numerical results also lead us to expect that the band structures for the hole and electron  doped materials will be quite different .",
    "we find that the band structure of the hole ",
    "doped material is similar to fig . 4 of @xcite ( which is a @xmath85 curve ) ,",
    "although with the increased ratio of @xmath86 that we are using here the band along @xmath87 becomes quite flat .",
    "this is similar to recent photoemission work of the valence band of undoped @xmath88 @xcite , and provides some experimental support for a value of @xmath26 around @xmath89 .",
    "we have listed the single carrier band structure energies for our @xmath90 24site cluster in table i for both the hole and electron  doped systems having used @xmath91    the single  hole ground states of the hole and electron  doped materials are different  so what ? as mentioned above , the important fact contained in ref .",
    "@xcite is that a knowledge of the single  hole ground state can aid in understanding whether or not any short  ranged incommensurate correlations are introduced into the ground state of the multiply  doped system .",
    "this followed from ( i ) if the single  hole ground state is not a @xmath22 state , no tendencies towards incommensurate correlations occurred , consistent with the spiral phase prediction of shraiman and siggia @xcite , and ( ii ) the electron momentum distribution function for 2 , 3 and 4 holes was found to be composed of the half  filled fermi surface with dimples at those momenta corresponding to the single ",
    "hole ground states , thus suggesting that some form of rigid band filling @xcite is in effect . combining this with the differing single ",
    "hole ground states mentioned above , it is clear that we can now extrapolate these abstract results to the physical systems under consideration .    figures 2 and 3 show the magnetic structure factor for 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 holes ( electrons ) for @xmath92 evaluated with the @xmath80 cluster introduced in @xcite  similar results are obtained for other @xmath93 pairs . for the hole ",
    "doped material , fig .",
    "2 displays that the peak in the structure factor shifts from @xmath94 for 0 and 1 hole , to @xmath95 for 2 holes , to @xmath96 for 3 and 4 holes .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the behaviour displayed in fig .",
    "@xcite for @xmath85 .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "3 it is seen that no shifts of the maximum of @xmath7 away from @xmath94 occurs for any doping concentration away from half filling for the electron ",
    "doped system .",
    "these results are entirely consistent with fig . 1 , and , in particular , are consistent with the lack of any tendency of the electron  doped materials to display the kind of incommensurate correlations that are present in the hole ",
    "doped system @xcite .",
    "clearly , these numerical results suggest that we have found a reasonable starting point from which one can hope to be able to describe the hole and electron  doped 214 systems .",
    "we now try to come to an understanding of these numerical results .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the existence of shraiman  siggia quasiparticles in weakly doped @xmath45 is supported by the theories @xcite that assume their existence , and are subsequently able to produce results consistent with experiment . to be specific",
    ", it seems that a scenario in which these quasiparticles are weakly interacting and tend to stay very far apart from one another ( thus making it likely that some form of rigid band filling ( e.g. with hole pockets around @xmath97 ) is applicable .",
    "now we study the @xmath98 quasiparticles : we are proposing that these are the single ",
    "hole ground state constituents that exist in the weakly doped @xmath46 system .",
    "we wish to characterize the spin distortions that each such quasiparticle produces , as well as come to an understanding of the spatial distribution for a state which is multiply doped .",
    "this will allow us to ( i ) understand why the @xmath98 and @xmath99 quasiparticles lead to differing magnetic structure factors vs. doping , and ( ii ) examine some of the other physical features that are known to be specific to the electron  doped system .    according to the semiclassical theory of shraiman and siggia @xcite",
    ", for ground states with these wave vectors , differing distortions of the spin background occur . for the @xmath100 states , long ",
    "ranged spin distortions with dipolar symmetry are produced via backflow .",
    "for the @xmath101 ground states , the hydrodynamic theory of shraiman and siggia @xcite leads to the prediction that the spin distortion induced by one @xmath98 quasiparticle is short ranged .",
    "these ideas are verified in our figs . 4 and 5 where our results from evaluating the energies at this wave vector for the @xmath3 model with the electron  doped material parameters using a semiclassical variational wave function , such as that described in @xcite , are displayed . to be specific ,",
    "we utilize a product state of classical spins in an infinite lattice , and incorporate a broken antiferromagnetic symmetry in calculations of the hopping matrix elements for a single hole ( see @xcite for the details of such a variational wave function ) . then , to display the range of the spin distortions for this ground state we have calculated the minimum energy as a function of the number of spins away from the hole that are allowed to be distorted from their undoped neel configuration  these sites are shown in fig .",
    "4 , where they are labeled according to the equivalent sites around a single carrier . in fig .",
    "5 we show the minimum energies found from the variational principle as a function of these site labels for both the hole  doped @xmath102 one hole ground state , and the @xmath101 electron  doped one carrier ground state .",
    "the long  ranged spin distortion of the hole ",
    "doped ground state is clear , whereas the short  ranged distortion of the electron ",
    "doped ground state is made manifest by the insensitivity of the minimum energy when one allows more distant neighbours to be distorted from their neel state .",
    "the above procedure may be repeated for all wave vectors for both hole and electron  doped hamiltonians .",
    "we find that providing @xmath26 satisfies certain inequalities ( which necessarily depend on the ratio of @xmath72 ) that the semiclassical band structure largely reproduces the band structures determined by exact diagonalization .",
    "specifically , the ground states are reproduced when ( i ) @xmath103 for the hole ",
    "doped material , and ( ii ) @xmath104 for the electron ",
    "doped materials ( these inequalities will be affected by quantum fluctuations  see below ) .",
    "this agreement with the quantum cluster studies provides further evidence that the renormalized classical description of the spin background ( _ not _ including the charge carriers ) of the weakly doped systems is valid at least at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this semiclassical work ignores quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , as shown by reiter @xcite , for an infinite lattice when quantum fluctuations are included in such variational wave functions one still finds the shraiman ",
    "siggia dipolar quasiparticles with the long  ranged dipolar spin distortion intact .",
    "we have found @xcite that within this lowest  order self ",
    "consistent approximation @xcite the @xmath98 states still only involve short  ranged spin distortions , the same as the semiclassical prediction .",
    "thus , it is not unexpected that our quantum cluster and semiclassical analyses agree .",
    "now let us consider the effect of the short  ranged spin distortions that this kind of quasiparticle produces , viz .",
    "why do these quasiparticles not introduce any incommensurate correlations into the spin texture .",
    "given the short  ranged nature of the spin distortion , it is clear that they could lead to a disturbance of the spin texture similar to that found in the quantum dilution problem @xcite , since static vacancies also produce a short  ranged disturbance of the spin texture .",
    "however , the quantum dilution problem begins with the assumption that the dilutants are randomly distributed throughout a plane .",
    "we now show that this is probably not the case for the mobile carriers in the electron ",
    "doped materials .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we presented some numerics for the hole ",
    "hole correlation function for a pair of holes doped into a @xmath80 cluster described by the @xmath21 model .",

    "( it is interesting to note that this is entirely consistent with experimental work purporting to see charge  rich walls , separated by distances scaling like @xmath105 , arising from finite  size striped magnetic domains at low @xmath106 @xcite .",

    "however , for the electron  doped material one finds that there is both a stronger binding of a single pair of holes , as well as a very low interaction energy , at least relative to the hole ",
    "doped material , as the number of carriers increases .",
    "this shows that the mobile electrons have a much greater propensity to cluster together than do the mobile holes .    summarizing the numerical work of the last two sections : ( i ) the single  hole quasiparticles of the hole ",
    "doped system are shraiman  siggia dipolar quasiparticles .",
    "they tend to remain far from each other , and are thus consistent with some form of superposition of these many  body quantum states in the low  doping limit @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the single  carrier ground state of the electron  doped material is different than that of the hole ",
    "doped system , viz .",
    "it is a @xmath98 state as opposed to a @xmath99 state , and a non ",
    "zero density of the former tend to exhibit a much stronger tendency to cluster together than do the holes of the hole  doped material .",
    "the spin distortions for these quasiparticles are long ( short ) ranged for the hole ( electron ) doped systems .",
    "considering the data contained in fig . 6 and table ii",
    ", we have reason to believe that for the electron  doped materials the carriers have a strong tendency towards phase separation  certainly the tendency is much stronger than in the hole ",
    "doped system .",
    "however , since table ii shows that there are not purely attractive interactions between the mobile electron carriers , this tendency will probably lead to the presence of low  energy excited states corresponding to fluctuations into a locally phase separated state .",
    "then , perhaps these phase separated states are the cause of the mid  gap states seen in the photoemission work @xcite , as was suggested elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as espoused by emery and kivelson @xcite , phase separation in the large hopping limit is likely to be frustrated , the frustration being due to the presence of long  ranged coulomb interactions .",
    "we have investigated the effect of including a near  neighbour coulomb repulsion between carriers on neighbouring sites , and find that no qualitative changes take place until very large coulomb interactions ( say of order much larger than @xmath25 ) are present .",
    "however , we do not know how long  ranged coulomb interactions will effect our conclusions , and this is presently being studied .",
    "further , trugman @xcite noted that tendencies towards the binding of a pair of holes can be greatly reduced by next ",
    "nearest neighbour three  site spin ",
    "dependent hopping . while this form of hopping will be of much lower order than the next",
    " nearest neighbour hopping that we are studying ( since we begin with a three - band , not a one  band ( as does trugman ) , description ) , and thus we do not expect any qualitative changes in our analysis , we feel it appropriate to see in what quantitative ways our observed tendency towards a phase separated state in electron  doped planes changes with such a hopping term present .",
    "thus , we are also presently studying the effects of such terms .",
    "consequently , we propose that the commensurate antiferromagnetic spin background of the electron  doped materials do not have incommensurate correlations introduced into them because ( i ) the quasiparticles introduced into the weakly doped planes are not shraiman  siggia dipolar quasiparticles , and ( ii ) the mobile electrons found in these materials exhibit a form of phase separation , and no incommensurate correlations are expected for such a state of matter . we have completed a study of the electron / hole momentum distribution functions , similar to those presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , including an evaluation of the density of states for both the hole and electron  doped compounds , and this work ( to be presented later ) further strengthens our assertion that some form of carrier clustering is taking place in the electron ",
    "doped materials .",
    "our numerical results and semiclassical studies have led to the proposal that the single ",
    "hole ground states in the hole and electron  doped materials are different , and that this has a profound effect on ( i ) their magnetic phase diagrams , and ( ii ) the tendency towards phase separation that these carriers display . the shraiman  siggia dipolar quasiparticle picture has been shown @xcite to be consistent with many different experiments studying the hole  doped @xmath45 system , and it will be interesting to see if our @xmath98 quasiparticle picture of phase separation in the @xmath46 can be used to explain more than just the arpes results associated with the mid  gap states found in arpes studies @xcite .",
    "one other experiment that may possibly find an explanation in the frustrated phase separation scenario for the electron  doped material involves the resistivity vs. temperature results of hikada @xmath31 @xcite . to be specific , if the mobile electrons tend to cluster together for sufficiently long periods of time , the dominant interaction between carriers is electronic as opposed to magnetic , and thus a fermi  liquid  like @xmath123 is not that surprising .",
    "of course , such a qualitative explanation requires rigorous calculations to be carried out before it is to be taken seriously .",
    "we have addressed the magnetic and other material characteristics of the two 214 high @xmath9 systems .",
    "however , the approach of utilizing the @xmath3 system does not seem to be limited to these single  layer high @xmath9 materials .",
    "recently , it has been proposed @xcite that hole pockets appear in the @xmath33 material as one dopes away from the antiferromagnetic insulator , and that these pockets are centred at @xmath96 .",
    "this is entirely consistent with the  small fermi surface \" observed in arpes studies of @xmath124 @xcite .",
    "in order to model such a system one must include a @xmath26 parameter that rotates the fermi surface by 45@xmath125 with respect to that predicted by the @xmath21 model , and to this end we have used @xmath126 and @xmath76 .",
    "then , we find ( i ) that indeed the single  hole ground state occurs at @xmath127 ( this was also found in the study of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and ( ii ) that pairs of such holes tend to stay as far apart as possible , with a hole  hole correlation function similar to that shown for the hole ",
    "doped material in fig .",
    "thus , weakly interacting quasiparticles forming small hole pockets at @xmath94 is consistent with our numerics , and are not expected to lead to any incommensurability @xcite . noting that both our semiclassical work ( similar to that shown in fig . 5 ) and the spin  wave analysis of reiter @xcite predict that the spin distortions produced by @xmath94 quasiparticles are long ranged , it is very interesting that in the two systems in which the holes tend to stay as far apart as possible , the single ",
    "carrier quasiparticles produce long  ranged spin distortions , and we are presently exploring this coincidence .",

    "even if the carriers were localized , there is another reason why the above analyses can not be a complete explanation of the magnetic phase diagrams .",

    "why would the carriers localize on just one such site when any of the other 3 sites are just as good ? clearly , the carriers can only be localized to at least these four sites .",
