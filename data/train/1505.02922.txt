    "what is the maximum temperature where the bulk of qcd thermodynamics can be described in hadronic terms , with no explicit reference to the underlying quarks and gluons ? in this contribution",
    "we analyze to what extent can one describe the qcd thermodynamics from the hadronic spectrum .",
    "we thus hope to identify the nature of non - hadronic precursors of the crossover to the quark - gluon plasma in terms of low temperature partonic expansions  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the relation between spectrum and partition function provides the thermodynamic free energy @xmath0 @xmath1 the example of a hydrogen gas in qed illustrates the situation and motivates the discussion regarding the completeness of states which ultimately are interacting protons and electrons . at low temperatures , states are molecular , i.e. @xmath2 states which behave as compact and structureless .",
    "when we heat up the system a rovibrational spectrum of states @xmath3 emerges and eventually the molecule is disociated into atoms @xmath4 . at higher temperatures ,",
    "atoms are excited @xmath5 and eventually ionized into a plasma of @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the continuum where the @xmath6 and @xmath7 constituents becomes manifest .",
    "clearly , neutral states ( atomic or molecular ) are not effectively complete at all temperatures and residual interactions corresponding to background non - resonant scattering become relevant  @xcite .",
    "in qcd on the lattice @xmath0 is determined by integrating the trace anomaly , @xmath8 with respect to the temperature and _ assuming _ a reference value , ideally @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "once this condition is imposed we expect that at sufficiently low temperatures all the observables are described in terms of hadronic degrees of freedom ; the quark - gluon underlying constituents are disclosed at very high temperatures .",
    "this quark - hadron duality _ at low temperature _ has been confirmed by the most recent and accurate lattice calculations at finite temperature  @xcite are confronted with the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) , a rather simple system of non - interacting point - like and structureless hadrons @xmath11 here , the sum is over _ all _ hadronic states including spin - isospin and anti - particle degeneracies , @xmath12 for mesons and baryons respectively , @xmath13 is the energy and the cumulative number of states ( degeneracy included ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 are the hadron masses .",
    "the spectrum can be taken either directly from the pdg  @xcite or the relativized quark model ( rqm )  refs .",
    "indeed , requiring @xmath16 ^ 2 \\sim n_{\\rm dat }   \\pm \\sqrt{2 n_{\\rm dat } } \\ , ,   \\label{eq : chi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we get @xmath17 for @xmath18 lattice points  @xcite both for pdg and rqm , showing that they can be used to saturate the hadronic spectrum for light quarks provided @xmath19 .",
    "this rqm saturation will be assumed also to take place when heavy quarks are involved in which case the pdg lacks many of the needed states .",
    "this of course suggests to determine _ directly _ @xmath20 from the @xmath21 data , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : deut ] ( left panel ) .",
    "the partition function and its comparison with hadronic states through the trace anomaly @xmath21 , displays explicitly the connection between spectrum and thermodynamics yielding the statistically significant identification of @xmath22 with @xmath23 using pdg or rqm where only @xmath24 and @xmath25 states contribute .",
    "but , which hadronic states count into the calculation of the thermodynamic properties ? . as argued long ago  @xcite , counting hadronic states implicitly averages over some scale , and so states such as the deuteron ( made of @xmath26 ) generate fluctuations in a smaller nuclear scale .",
    "the cumulative number in a given channel @xmath27 with bound states @xmath28 below the threshold @xmath29 is in general ( see e.g. @xcite ) @xmath30 \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which becomes @xmath31/\\pi=0 $ ] due to levinson s theorem .",
    "this fluctuation is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : deut ] for the nn channel where @xmath32 , and the deuteron mass is @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "thus , the deuteron does nt count .",
    "this is a general feature of weakly bound states , which for the copious new x , y , z states , might affect the thermodynamics if the hrg was blindly identified with the pdg ( with _ all _ x , y , z s ) .",
    "the linearly growing static energy of two @xmath35 and @xmath36 sources in the fundamental representation of the su(@xmath37)-group placed at a distance @xmath38 is often identified with confinement with a string tension @xmath39 . including the short distance ( perturbative ) coulomb - like behaviour yields the venerable cornell potential for the ground state @xmath40",
    "actually , the mass of a @xmath41 state , becomes unstable at a critical distance @xmath42 when a light @xmath43 pair is created from the vacuum and the heavy - light meson - antimeson @xmath44 channel opens @xmath45 where the weak van der waals like meson exchange interaction in the @xmath46 sector is neglected   proceeds as follows . due to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking",
    "the quarks acquire an additive _ dynamical _ mass @xmath47 contribution to the total mass @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the _ current _ mass . for light @xmath43-mesons @xmath50 whereas for light - heavy ( @xmath51 ) mesons @xmath52 and thus @xmath53 which yields @xmath54 in fair agreement with the lattice estimate  @xcite . ] . we have a diabatic crossing structure which turns into an adiabatic avoided crossing when the transition strength @xmath55 is included . in general , one has excited meson states , @xmath56 where @xmath57 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : isgur3 ] we show the resulting adiabatic spectrum based on the rqm  @xcite when a mixing strength of @xmath58 is implemented .",
    "much of our understanding of the qcd dynamics at finite temperature is linked to the helmholtz free energy defined as the maximum work the system can exchange at fixed temperature between two heavy @xmath59 at separation @xmath38 . in the confined phase , the correlator between polyakov loops becomes  @xcite @xmath60 where , before mixing , one has the crossing among the energy levels up to @xmath61 pair creation . neglecting the avoided crossing , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fave ] ) yields @xmath62 where @xmath63 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : flisgurmesons ] the heavy @xmath64 free energy obtained with eq .",
    "( [ eq : fave2 ] ) by using the spectrum of heavy - light mesons with a charm ( bottom ) quark , and no strangeness , obtained with the isgur model of ref .",
    "@xcite up to @xmath65gev .",
    "we have considered @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( no fit ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : flisgurmesons ] we also show the polyakov loop computed as @xmath68 the agreement with lattice data is quite good for @xmath69 .",
    "thus the spectrum both for the pdg and the rqm saturates the sum rules at these temperatures   by a factor @xmath70 with @xmath71mev , we get good agreement with the lowest temperature lattice point .",
    "this kind of ambiguity comes from renormalization effects . like",
    "in  @xcite we assume @xmath72 for @xmath73 .",
    "the recent evaluation of ref .",
    "@xcite , unlike  @xcite is based on a different renormalization condition and @xmath74 for the free energy and the role of avoiding crossing will be analyzed elsewhere . ] whereas the finite temperature does not resolve avoided crossings making them effectively diabatic passages .",
    "while much of the effort has been directed towards a description of the hadron - to - quark - gluon crossover , at present there is no understanding on the mechanism , perhaps because confinement itself is not really well understood .",
    "our analysis of the free energy suggests that lowest temperatures where purely hadronic states account for qcd observables is rather large @xmath75 and close to the critical temperature .",
