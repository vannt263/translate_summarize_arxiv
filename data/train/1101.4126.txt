    "<S> charged @xmath0 decays to three charged kaons are analysed in the framework of the qcd factorization approach . </S>",

    "<S> the scalar non - strange and strange form factors at low @xmath1 effective masses are constrained by chiral perturbation theory and satisfy the two - body unitarity conditions . the latter stem from the properties of the meson - meson amplitudes which describe all possible @xmath2-wave transitions between three coupled channels consisting of two kaons , two pions and four pions . </S>",
