    "the high incidence of binarity among kbos is of considerable intrinsic interest as a probe of the dynamics of the kuiper belt ( _ e.g. _  stern , 2002 ; goldreich _ et al_.  2002 ; astakhov _ et al_.  2005 ) .",

    "in photometry mode images of the target are taken at many dithered positions on the arrays to improve the photometric accuracy and the sampling of the psf .",

    "the widths of the filter bandpasses are about 25% , resulting in modest color corrections .",
    "we iteratively applied color corrections to our photometry , which converged to give a color temperature of 64.5  k , and color corrections of @xmath12% and @xmath13% at 24 and 70  @xmath1 m  respectively .",

    "these additional processing steps will be incorporated into the ssc pipeline data products by _ circa _ the end of 2006 . for the field where we observed ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 ,",
    "the additional processing reduced the total noise ( including both conventional noise and that due to background sources ) in the 24  @xmath1 m  image by 30% .",
    "the 70  @xmath1 m data processing was basically identical to that of the _ spitzer _ pipeline ( version s12 ) .",
    "we converted the calibrated instrumental count rates to flux density using factors of 1.042 @xmath1jy/@xmath14 and 16.6 mjy/@xmath14 in the 24 and 70 @xmath1 m bands , respectively .",
    "figure  1 shows the resulting images .",
    "we measured the flux density of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  using apertures @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( about 4 and 3 native pixels ) in diameter at 24 and 70  @xmath1 m ; the psf full - width at half - max is @xmath17 and @xmath18 in those bands .",
    "the apertures were positioned at the center - of - light centroid .",
    "these small apertures improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the measurements , but require both excellent sampling of the psf , and the application of significant aperture corrections .",
    "mosaics were constructed using @xmath19 and @xmath20 pixels at 24 and 70  @xmath1 m ( about @xmath21 the native pixel scale of those arrays ) .",
    "mosaicking at this level of sub - sampling , in combination with the multiply - dithered nature of the observations , results in images with excellent psf sampling and centroid reproducibility .",
    "we computed aperture corrections using smoothed stinytim model psfs .",
    "we smoothed the model psfs until they agreed with observed stellar psfs , giving a noiseless , perfectly normalized , zero - background model psf .",
    "we performed photometry on the result , deriving aperture corrections of 1.91 and 1.85 at 24 and 70  @xmath1 m , respectively .",
    "this method has been verified to result in errors @xmath22% in the photometry of calibration stars of moderate brightness .",
    "the response of the mips detectors is quite linear for signals ranging from the natural sky background to near the saturation limit , so our aperture corrections should apply accurately for photometry of faint sources .",
    "table  2 summarizes the circumstances of our observations and the measured , color - corrected flux densities : @xmath23 and @xmath24  mjy at 24 and 70  @xmath1 m , respectively .    because we did not make a second observation of the field where we detected ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 , it is impossible to rule out the possibility that a background source may have coincided with our target , biasing our photometry",
    "however , the areal density of extra - galactic sources bright enough to have influenced our results is quite low , and the probability that one could have serendipitously fallen within our beam is quite low in both bands .",
    "the areal density of 0.1@xmath250.05 mjy 24 @xmath1 m sources is 3 / arcmin@xmath26 ( papovich _ et al_.  2004 ) . for our aperture size ( 0.022 arcmin@xmath26 ) this translates into a probability of 6.6% that our 24  @xmath1mphotometry could be contaminated by a 0.1 mjy source .",
    "the probability that a fainter source falls in the beam is higher , but such a source would have an insignificant effect on our photometry .",
    "we compute the areal density of 70 @xmath1 m sources based on the results of dole _",
    "et al_.  ( 2004 ) . at 70 @xmath1",
    "m the density of @xmath27 mjy sources is @xmath28/arcmin@xmath26 , which translates to an 7.6% probability of a contaminating source in our 0.19 arcmin@xmath26 aperture . again , fainter sources are more likely than this to fall within the beam , but would have an insignificant effect on the photometry .",
    "thus , not only is the probability of contamination by an extra - galactic source small at relevant flux densities , the effect on our photometry would be small relative to our estimated flux errors .",
    "furthermore , the observed 24 to 70um color is redder than would be expected for a typical background source . for ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 the 70:24 ratio of fluxes is @xmath29 , whereas the results of papovich et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and dole et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , indicate that a typical ratio for a background galaxy is @xmath30 .",
    "thus is is unlikely that our photometry is strongly contaminated by a background galaxy , because such contamination would result in an untenably high color temperature , whereas the color temperature we derive ( see below ) is very plausible for an object at the distance of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 .",
    "sources within the galaxy can also contaminate far - ir photometry .",
    "in particular , thermal emission from extended , uneven clouds of interstellar dust can increase the noise in regions of the sky where such `` infrared cirrus '' appears in the background .",
    "an advantage of _ spitzer _  and mips over earlier far - ir missions is the relatively small psf , the fact that the psf is well - sampled by the pixels , and the fact that the field of view of the arrays is significantly larger than the psf .",
    "these facts allow direct estimation of the contribution of ir cirrus ( and extra - galactic confusion for that matter ) directly from the images .",
    "inspection of figure  1 shows that cirrus did not constribute significantly to our photometric errors .",
    "it also seems unlikely that there could be a coma contributing significantly at 24 or 70  @xmath1 m , because there is no evidence for variability in the visible colors or absolute magnitudes from multiple photometric observations .",
    "a possibility that we can not rule out is that ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  posesses a coma dominated by relatively large particles that would scatter poorly at visible to near - ir wavelengths , but which could contribute significantly in the thermal . given the lack of any direct evidence of a coma around ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 , and the requirement that it be both ir - bright and v - invisible to affect our interpretation of the data , we do not pursue this possibility further here .",
    "the standard thermal model ( stm , lebofsky & spencer 1989 ) is the most widely used model for interpreting observations of thermal emission from small bodies in the asteroid main belt and the outer solar system ( _ c.f . _",
    "tedesco et al . 2002 ; fernndez et al . 2002 ; campins et al .",
    "the model assumes a spherical body whose surface is in instantaneous equilibrium with the insolation , equivalent to assuming either a thermal inertia of zero , a non - rotating body , or a rotating body illuminated and viewed pole - on . in the stm",
    "the subsolar point temperature is @xmath31^{1/4}\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath32 is the solar constant at the distance of the body , @xmath33 is the geometric albedo , @xmath34 is the phase integral ( assumed here to be 0.39 , equivalent to a scattering assymetry parameter , @xmath35 ( lumme and bowell 1981 ; bowell _ et al_.  1989 ) ) , @xmath36 is the beaming parameter , @xmath37 is the emissivity ( which we set to 0.9 ) , and @xmath38 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . given @xmath39 , the temperature as a function of position on the surface is @xmath40 where @xmath1 is the cosine of the insolation angle .",
    "the nightside temperature is taken to be zero .",
    "surface roughness leads to localized variations in surface temperature and non - isotropic thermal emission ( beaming ) because individual points on the surface radiate their heat preferentially in the sunward direction .",
    "thus , when viewed at small phase angles , rough surfaces appear warmer than smooth ones , and the thermal emission tends to be dominated by emission from the warmer depressions and sunward - facing slopes .",
    "this effect is captured by the beaming parameter , @xmath36 .",
    "lebofsky et al .",
    "( 1986 ) found @xmath41 for ceres and vesta ; the nominal range for @xmath36 is 0 to 1 , with unity corresponding to a perfectly smooth surface ( lebofsky & spencer 1989 ) . in modeling the thermal emission from a large sample of jovian trojan asteroids , fernndez _",
    "et al_.  ( 2003 ) found a typical value of @xmath36 for that population of about 0.94 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath36 enters the equations for the surface temperature in a manner analogous to the emissivity , so our results could be couched in terms of emissivity rather than beaming parameter .",
    "the thermal emission from a target is calculated by computing a surface integral of the planck function over the visible portion of the object ( because we do this integral , our model is formally a modified version of the stm ) .",
    "the planck function at a particular point on the surface depends on the calculated temperatures ( eq .",
    "1 ) and the wavelength of interest .",
    "this flux density is then scaled by a dilution factor proportional to @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the diameter , and @xmath44 is the _",
    "spitzer_-centric distance .",
    "the phase angle , which is invariably very small for kbos , enters into the integral over the visible hemisphere . here",
    "we have set @xmath45 , as the effects are negligible for the actual phase of our observations ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the total flux density thus depends on both the target s unknown diameter , @xmath43 , and albedo , @xmath33 , as well as its distance from the sun and the observer .",
    "solutions for the size and albedo require a second equation ; the object s visible magnitude typically provides this constraint .",
    "we used the absolute visual magnitude of doressoundiram _",
    "et al_.   ( 2005 ) , @xmath47 , to relate the diameter and albedo via @xmath48 ( _ e.g. , _",
    "harris 1998 ) , where @xmath43 is the diameter in km .",
    "the 24 and 70  @xmath1 m photometry and results from the stm thermal model are shown in figure 2a . using the values of q and @xmath37 noted above , we allowed @xmath36 to vary .",
    "the best fit to the data in figure 2a has @xmath49  km , @xmath50 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the range of model parameters that are consistent with the @xmath52 error bars of our data are summarized in table  3 .",
    "we note that the model parameters are the _ system - average , or effective , values of the diameter , albedo , and beaming parameter _ , because the system is not resolved at 24 nor 70  @xmath1m(nor at v for the ground - based visible measurements ) .",
    "it is not unusual to allow @xmath36 to range above unity ( harris 1998 ; fernndez et al .",
    "2003 ; delbo et al .",
    "2003 ) when fitting thermal data with the stm .",
    "as can be seen from equation 1 , @xmath53 will result in overall lower surface temperatures , even though @xmath36 was traditionally introduced to model elevated localized temperatures caused by roughness .",
    "we interpret @xmath53 to be an indication that the body has a non - zero thermal inertia , a relatively short rotation period , a fairly smooth surface , or some combination of the three .",
    "therefore , the idealized assumptions in the stm do not perfectly apply .",
    "this is not entirely surprising given the low temperature of the object , which has the effect of lengthening the radiative cooling timescale , violating the instantaneous thermal equilibrium assumption of the stm .",
    "the isothermal latitude model ( ilm ) is the opposing end - member model to the stm : the target is assumed to have a surface with infinite thermal inertia , or , equivalently , to rotate instantaneously ( also called the  fast - rotator model \" ; lebofsky & spencer 1989 ) . in real terms , the ilm applies for objects with rotation periods much shorter than the timescale for radiative cooling of the surface .",
    "it is also typically assumed that the subsolar latitude is zero , although other geometries can be readily computed . in this geometry",
    "the surface temperature depends only on the latitude , and is constant over longitude .",
    "strictly speaking , under the ilm @xmath54 .",
    "figure 2b compares our photometry with ilm models .",
    "we were unable to fit the data under the assumption that @xmath54 , and so again allowed it to be a free parameter .",
    "the resulting best fit has @xmath55 km , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "the range of model parameters consistent with our data are summarized in table  3 .",
    "we interpret @xmath58 under the ilm as an indication that the thermal inertia could actually be rather low ( although the stm results indicate that it is very likely greater than zero ) .    if the orientation of the rotational axis and the rotational period are known , it is possible to improve the ilm model results by accounting for the actual viewing geometry .",
    "such a tilted ilm is an end - member case of a thermophysical model , incorporating the time - dependence of insolation , conduction , and re - radiation .",
    "if we assume that the rotational axes of the ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  binary components are approximately aligned with the orbit normal , the viewing geometry of our observations is specified .",
    "using the position of the normal to the ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  orbit ( margot _ et al_.2005b ) , we find that the sub-_spitzer _  and sub - solar latitude was @xmath59 .",
    "table  3 summarizes the results of the ilm for this geometry .    using the same assumption for the orientation of the rotation axes",
    ", we also fit the data using a smooth - surface thermophysical model , which includes the time - dependent effect of conduction into and out of the subsurface ( _ e.g. _  spencer 1990 ) .",

    "the spectral energy distributions resulting from these models are nearly indistinguishable from those shown in figure  2 .",
    "also , because we have added a model parameter , somewhat larger ranges of @xmath33 and @xmath43 are found to be consistent with the data .",
    "we also undertook a monte carlo approach to see if we could constrain the pole orientation of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 . in this case",
    "we used the rough - surface thermophysical model of spencer ( 1990 ) .",
    "thermal inertias ( 5  100 ) , emissivities ( 0.9  1.0 ) , albedos ( 0.01  0.5 ) , rotational periods ( 6  32 hr ) , and spin orientations were all varied randomly ( within the ranges just given ) ; the spin orientation was distributed homogeneously in terms of solid - angle with respect to the line of sight .",
    "parameters from thermophysical models with 24 and 70 @xmath1 m  fluxes consistent with our data and the absolute v magnitude for ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  ( to within @xmath61 ) were tabulated . of the 300000 models we ran ,",
    "539 were consistent with the observations .",
    "the results of this modeling are shown in figure  3 .",
    "while a significant range of model parameters are consistent with our thermal measurements , clustering of the points shows that some portions of the parameter space are more likely than others .",
    "acceptable models had geometric albedos between 0.052 and 0.108 , and effective diameters between 340 and 483 km , entirely consistent with the ranges of those parameters found earlier , and confirming that those ranges encompass uncertainties resulting from model assumptions .",
    "interestingly , thermophysical models with very high ( @xmath62 ) or with very low ( @xmath63 ) sub - solar latitudes could not fit the data .",
    "80% of the fitting models have sub - solar latitudes between 40  and 60 , neatly bracketing the 49  implied by alignment between the spin - axis and the satellite orbit angular momentum vector .",
    "tidal evolution frequently drives satellite spins towards zero obliquity ( peale , 1999 ) , but the obliquity of the primary is relatively insensitive to tidal evolution under the influence of the satellite . if the ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  binary formed in a massive impact ( similar to the pluto - charon forming impact , canup 2005 ) the angular momenta vectors of the orbit and primary rotation should be nearly parallel .",
    "other mechanisms proposed for forming kuiper belt binaries do not appear to predict any particular relationship between the orientation of spin and orbital angular momenta ( weidenschilling 2002 ; goldreich _ et al_.  2002 ; funato _ et al_.  2005 ) . if our prediction that the spin of the ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  primary is roughly aligned with the orbital angular momentum could be independently verified ( or disproved ) , it would help constrain how the binary formed in the first place .",

    "many of the best fitting models are clustered at the upper end of the range of @xmath60 we explored ( see figure  3 ) , so it is possible the thermal inertia is greater than the upper limit of 100 which we imposed .",
    "some models that are consistent with the data also have @xmath60 as low as 7.5 , but are associated with improbable combinations of the other model paramters .",
    "@xmath60 is around 50 for the moon , and in the range 15  100 in these units for pluto ( lellouch _ et al_.  2000 ) .",
    "et al_.  ( 2004 ) estimated @xmath60 for 2002  aw@xmath68 to be below 20 , for an assumed equatorial viewing geometry . as the geometry moves to higher latitudes the effect of thermal inertia is diluted ( in the extreme case , a pole - on ilm is quivalent to the stm , and no constraint can be placed on @xmath60 ) .",
    "these values of @xmath60 are consistent with a porous or particulate surface , or the presence of a low - conductivity material such as amorphous water ice or unconsolidated carbonaceous particles in the surface layers .    from all of these model fits to the data , we find that the effective diameter of the ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  system is in the range @xmath69 km , and the visible geometric albedo in the range @xmath70 .",
    "these adopted values ( table  3 ) encompass both measurement uncertainties on the fluxes , and the uncertainties associated with interpreting the fluxes using the suite of thermal models described above . because the only common outputs of all the models are albedo and size , we only provide adopted values for those quantities .",
    "these parameter ranges exclude some of the most extreme models that fit the data , but span most of the reasonable models .",

    ". nevertheless , it seems possible that combining data from so many epochs might contribute to errors higher than nominal , so perhaps the discrepancy with our data can be attributed to somewhat optimistic error estimates for the 1.2  mm data .",

( 2005b ) were unsuitable for making the difficult measurement of the mass ratio , but knowledge of that ratio would provide another useful constraint on the sizes of the components , and thereby improve our density determination ( as discussed below ) . in summary , for our best effective diameter , @xmath90  km",
    ", the component diameters seem likely to lie in the ranges @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",

    "very low densities have been determined for many primitive solar system objects , in particular small bodies .",
    "for example , asphaug and benz ( 1996 ) estimated the density of comet shoemaker - levy 9 to have been 0.6  g/@xmath2based on observations of its tidal break - up during a close encounter with jupiter .",

    ", eunomia is particularly interesting because its density ( @xmath100  g/@xmath2 ) is far below the average density for s - class ( stony ) asteroids ( 2.7  g/@xmath2 ) , and because it is the largest asteroid ( diameter 255  km ) with such a low density ( see britt _",
    "et al_.  ( 2002 ) and hilton ( 2002 ) and references therein ) .",
    "et al_.  ( 2005 ) find that the density of jupiter s moon amalthea ( diameter @xmath101  km ) is @xmath102  g/@xmath2 .",
    "margot and brown ( 2001 ) discovered that 87 sylvia was a binary , and using the iras diameter derived a density of @xmath103  g/@xmath2 .",

( 2005 ) subsequently discovered that sylvia is actually a triple asteroid ( the first known , with two satellites orbiting the primary ) , and estimated the density of the @xmath104  km diameter primary be @xmath105  g/@xmath2 . trilling and bernstein ( 2005 ) applied rotational stability arguments to the 33 kbos and centaurs with published lightcurves and show that none require densities larger than 0.5 - 1.5 g / cc ( for various models ) to remain gravitationally bound given their observed rotation rates .",
    "while this does not mean their densities are in that range ( higher densities are not ruled out ) , it is interesting to note that the low density we find for ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  is in accord with the lower - end of their limits . because the rotation period of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  is unknown , their analysis can not be directly applied to it ( although such an analysis could be very revealing ) .",
    "it is relatively easy to imagine strength - dominated objects less than around 200 kilometers across having very low densities ( and presumably high porosities ) .",
    "most of the low - density objects just mentioned are known to have irregular shapes ( see references given above ) , indicating material strength does indeed dominate gravity in their interiors . such densities could be achieved via catastrophic disruption and re - accumulation ( _ e.g. _ richardson _ et al_.  2002 ) .",
    "such configurations are far less intuitively appealing in the case of an object such as ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 , likely to be more than 300 kilometers in diameter , in which gravitational forces are likely to dominate material strength for some significant portion of the interior .      given an assumption for the density , @xmath106 , of the material making up the solid portions of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 , the fractional void space , or porosity , @xmath107 , can be calculated from the total mass and the component diameters as @xmath108 .",
    "plausible values for @xmath106 range from around 0.9  g/@xmath2   ( that of water ice , almost certainly the dominant constituent ( _ e.g. _  anders & grevesse 1989 ) , and other molecular ices likely to be present ) to that of pluto and triton ( 2  g/@xmath2 , mckinnon _ et al_.  1997 ) , which are composed of roughly equal mass fractions of water ice and `` rocky '' material .",
    "pluto is a particularly likely compositional surrogate for ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 , because both bodies occupy the same orbital resonance with neptune and so probably formed at a similar heliocentric distance ( although ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  has a lower orbital inclination , and so may have formed exterior to pluto ) .",
    "while pluto is differentiated , significantly compressed by its own gravity , and probably lost some icy material in a charon - forming impact ( canup 2005 ) it is very difficult to imagine how ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0could have formed with a significantly different rock fraction .",
    "that being said , our density for ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  would be easier to accept if @xmath106 were near or even below 1  g/@xmath2 , suggesting a dearth of silicate materials , and a corresponding enrichment of water ice and other low - density molecular ices .",
    "candidate ices other than water that might be somewhat abundant are @xmath109 ( @xmath110  g/@xmath2 ) , @xmath111 ( @xmath112  g/@xmath2 ) , and @xmath113 ( @xmath97  g/@xmath2 ) ( scott , 1976 ; jiang _ et al_.   1975 ; manzhelii and tolkachev , 1964 ) .",
    "however , appealing to such an extreme composition is ad - hoc at best , and it seems highly unlikely that the low density can be explained without significant internal porosity or some other effect .",
    "figure  5 shows the porosity we derive for ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  for the plausible range of material densities , and for our adopted range of effective diameter for the system .",
    "porosity values for selected values of @xmath106 are given in table  4 .",
    "if we assume the material density is @xmath114 , then for an effective diameter of 405 km the range of porosity required is about 62  74% .",
    "if we take 1.5  g/@xmath2  as a likely average material density , then our adopted size limits constrain the porosity to be between 48  80%",
    ". porosities in the range 45  80% cover most of the allowed values in figure  5 . if we take @xmath72  km from from altenhoff _",
    "et al_.  ( 2004 ) and set @xmath115  g/@xmath2 , the porosity is 83% , and it gets progressively higher for larger material densities .",
    "we conclude that our results , if interpreted in terms of void spaces internal to ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 , require the porosity to be about 65% , with a range of about 45  80% .",
    "it is astonishing to think of such a large body having more than half of its interior volume taken up by voids .",
    "such an object strains the bound of what might reasonably be called a `` rubble - pile '' ( weissman 1986 ) , being volumetrically more akin to a `` void - pile '' , with some solid matter thrown in .    our lower porosity limit , 45% ,",
    "is still well in excess of the 26% expected for closely - packed equal - sized spheres , and is also in excess of that expected for randomly - packed equal - sized spheres ( 36% , _",
    "et al_.  2000 ) .",
    "if the component pieces are unequal , porosity decreases because the smaller ones will infill the gaps between the larger ones . an important effect that increases the porosity of a collection of particles is friction , which could be due to roughness and/or angularity of those particles .",
    "thus , a model which might be consistent with the high porosity implied by our density measurement is that the rubble in the interior of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  be both very irregular and of comparable size .",
    "another could be that the rubble is itself porous .",
    "such a configuration might result from relatively gentle assembly of grains to make macro particles , which then assemble to form porous `` boulders '' , and so - on until a large object with significant porosity at all scales results .",
    "similarly , sublimation of volatile components from within a water ice matrix could result in porosity at multiple scales .",
    "however , such paradigms ignore the fact that considerable momentum and energy must be dissipated during accretion , because accreted material will be deposited _ via _ high - velocity impacts .",
    "such impacts will lead to local compression , melting , and vaporization , and in some cases large - scale fracturing ( _ e.g. _ asphaug _ et al_.  1996 ; richardson _ et al_.2002 ) .",
    "indeed , impacts would generally tend to compress such a porous structure as that discussed above , casting doubt on whether it could arise during accretion or be maintained during subsequent billions of years of cratering .",
    "\\(47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  is also large enough that the expected internal stresses should lead to crushing and densification in the interior .",
    "the stress at the center of a homogenous sphere is @xmath116 . taking the highest - pressure scenario for ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  we set @xmath117 ( somewhat above the top of our range for density ) and @xmath90  km and find @xmath118  dyn / cm@xmath26 .",
    "the yield strength of water ice is @xmath120  dyn / cm@xmath26 ( beeman , 1988 ) at low confining pressures . in the case of a rubble - pile object ,",
    "the confining pressure is essentially zero ( _ i.e. _ the entire weight of overburden is comparable to the deviatoric stress at contact points between the fragments ) , and the low - pressure strength is the relevant one .",
    "so if the density of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  were around 1  g/@xmath2  and the primary were as large as our best - fit effective diameter for the system , voids in the deep interior would indeed be closed via crushing of icy material .",
    "however , @xmath121 depends on the square of both the density and the radius , so modest reductions in either or both lead to significant reduction in interior stress . for a density of 0.5  g/@xmath2and a diameter of 300  km , @xmath122  dyn / cm@xmath26 .",
    "it appears that ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  may be on the verge of being large and dense enough that it would be compressed , at least near the center , by its own weight .",
    "if so , and if the density of larger kbos can be measured , we predict that the larger objects would indeed have to be denser .",
    "the finding that significant strength - supported void space could exist in the interior of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 , is still somewhat puzzling . the lack of a lightcurve greater than 5  10% ( peixinho _ et",
    "al_.   2002 , ortiz _",
    "et al_.   2003 ; margot _ et al_.   2005a ) is itself evidence that gravity dominates strength in the interior , resulting in the relaxation of meso - scale topography and a near - spherical shape . to explore this apparent inconsistency",
    ", we examined the possibility that ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  has a low density ( porous ) outer mantle , and a denser , non - porous core . such a configuration might arise in an impact that produced a largest fragment that was a significant fraction of the size of the original body , as would be expected from a collision with a specific energy at or somewhat above the shattering specific energy , @xmath123 ( _ e.g. _ holsapple _ et al _ .. , 2002 ) . figure  6 shows results for the average density and porosity of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  as a function of the size of a hypothetical core .",
    "the figure assumes that the core is composed of a rocky component , with densities taken from the mckinnon _",
    "et al_.  ( 1997 and references therein ) models for the composition of pluto , and that the density of the mantle is 0.5  g/@xmath2  ( consistent with a composition dominated by water - ice with about 50% porosity ) .",
    "the upper - limit on the density of the binary , 0.8  g/@xmath2 , places only a weak constraint on the size of a rocky core within ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 : it could be as large as 0.450.51 of the total radius ( depending on the core composition ) and still satisfy our upper - bound on the density of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 .",
    "if the density is really 0.5  g/@xmath2 , there can be no core unless the mantle density is still lower . setting the mantle density to 0.3  g/@xmath2(_i.e .",
    "_ setting its porosity to 70% ) , we find that a rocky core could exist within ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 but that its size would be limited to 0.400.45 of the total radius . these results",
    "offer a compromise wherein ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  has a relatively dense core overlain by a very porous , water - ice mantle .",
    "the sperical shape of the core would presumably help to moderate the external form , causing the overall shape to tend towards the sphericity suggested by the lack of a measureable lightcurve .    in summary",
    ", while the nominal density and porosity we determined above are not strictly inconsistent with considerations of cosmochemistry , formation , evolution , and strength _ vs. _",
    "gravity , in each of these areas it seems that our nominal density range ( 0.30.8  g/@xmath2 ) is extreme .",
    "the tolerance of our density for the presence of a high - density core , even if that core is dominated by silicates with densities around 3  g/@xmath2 , provides for a plausible scenario where ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  can have a low - density / high - porosity and also have a spherical shape .",
    "however , such a low density for such a large object is still extreme .",
    "an alternative to the porous / rubble - pile models above is that one or both components of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  are very irregular in external form , essentially incorporating significant void space within their apparent limbs .",
    "as just discussed , this seems unlikely because of the lack of a measured lightcurve .",
    "however , an extreme case of such external porosity would be if one or both of the two known components are also binary ( or multiple ) systems .",
    "three multiple minor - planet systems are known : 87 sylvia is a triple ( marchis _ et al_.  2005 ) , pluto is a quadruple ( weaver _ et al_.2005 ; buie _ et al_.  2005 ) and 2003 el@xmath4 is a triple ( brown _ et al_.2005 ) .",
    "if ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  is a triple , the lack of a lightcurve is not particularly telling , as such a sub - binary would only possesses a lightcurve when one component eclipses the other ( during mutual events ) , assuming the intrinsic lightcurve of each component is negligible .",
    "for a multiple system of @xmath124 equal - size components , the density is given by @xmath125 : the density for the multi - component system is enhanced by a factor of @xmath126 relative to that for a single component system . in the case of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  we postulate that the primary may itself be an unresolved binary with component diameters of @xmath79 and @xmath127 ; the diameter of the resolved companion to the primary is @xmath81 , as before .",
    "if we restrict our consideration to the case where the three components have equal albedos , the density can be written as @xmath128^{3/2 } } \\over                       { 1+\\delta_3^{3/2}+\\delta_2^{3/2}(1+\\delta_3)^{3/2}}}\\ ] ] where @xmath129 , @xmath130 .",
    "in addition , @xmath131 from the observed magnitude difference between the primary and secondary .",
    "figure  7 shows the second term of the above expression as a function of the ratio @xmath132 . from the figure it is clear that to have a significant effect on the density we derive",
    ", the primary must be split into components of comparable size .",
    "if the ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  primary is actually 2 equal - sized components , this shows that the density of a trinary ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  is enhanced by a factor of 1.60 relative to the density for a single - body , and 1.38 relative to the density of a binary sytem ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "the resulting average density of the triple system is 0.7  g/@xmath2 , with a range of 0.4  1.1  g/@xmath2  ( compared to 0.3  0.8  g/@xmath2  for the binary system ) . the porosities derived earlier decrease to about 0.5 with a range of 0.1  0.7 .",
    "table  4 summarizes our results for the density of this hypothetical trinary system .",
    "these densities and porosities might be achievable given the likely major constituents of ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0 , and realizable internal structures .",
    "somewhat larger increases to the density could result if the secondary has a low albedo and is therefore comparable in size to the primary . in this case , and in the unlikely event that the secondary is also double , the density could be enhanced by a factor approaching 2 relative to the single - body density , or by a factor approaching 1.7 relative to the equal - albedo binary case .",
    "we detected thermal emission from the binary kbo ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  at 24 and 70  @xmath1musing the _ spitzer _  space telescope . when interpreted using a range of thermal models , we derive an effective diameter for the system in the range @xmath134  km , with the best value being 405  km .",
    "the corresponding range of the visible geometric albedo is @xmath135 , with the best value being 0.079 . when combined with the system mass determined from hst data by margot _",
    "et al_.  ( 2004 ; 2005a ; 2005b ) , our size determination indicates an average density in the range 0.3  0.8  g/@xmath2 . for likely bulk compositions , dominated by roughly equal mass fractions of rocky material and water ice ,",
    "the porosity required to explain densities this low is in the range 55  75% .",
    "such high porosities strain the bounds of what might reasonably be expected for naturally occurring internal structures for such a large object .",
    "however , we do find that ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  is just small enough that it might not be compressed under its own weight , so porosities this high can not be easily ruled out on those grounds .",
    "it is possible that the ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0primary could have a core with a density around 3  g/@xmath2 , so long as that core is smaller than about 1/2 the radius .",
    "the presence of a dense core may help reconcile the apparent inconsistency between the presence of large amounts of strength - supported void space in the interior and the nearly spherical shape evidenced by the lack of a measured lightcurve .",
    "if ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  is actually a triple system , the densities and porosities we derive must be modified accordingly .",
    "we derive a general expression for the density of the system as a function of the component sizes , and show that the density could actually be as much as 1.38 times greater than for the binary system , if the primary is split into comparably - sized components .",
    "such a trinary system would be consistent with the lack of an observed lightcurve so long as none of the components eclipse one another ( if the orbit of the primary - binary is inclined 49  to our line of sight , the centers of equal - sized components could be as close as three radii without eclipses occurring ) .",
    "the density of such a system would be in the range 0.4  1.1  g/@xmath2 . at the upper end , these densities are comparable to that of , _ e.g. _ , saturn s moons tethys and iapetus ( _ e.g._burns 1986 ) .",
    "these results suggest that in addition to being a binary kbo , ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0has unexpected internal properties .",
    "the large model uncertainties in the density and porosity could be reduced with additional data that provided constraints on the individual sizes of the primary and secondary , or that constrained their individual masses .",
    "in addition , very high - resolution imaging or lightcurve monitoring could help resolve the question of whether the ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  primary is itself actually multiple . if ( 47171 ) 1999  tc@xmath0  were found to have a short rotation period , that could place a lower bound on the density for which it would be stable against distortion or breakup due to rotation .",
