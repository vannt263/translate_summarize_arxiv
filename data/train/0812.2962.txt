    "the construction of large catalogs of galaxy clusters for use in studies of cosmology , large scale structure , and galaxy evolution has often proven to be a difficult task ( see * ? ? ? * for a review ) .",
    "indeed , the last such catalog generated using optical data , and covering the entire high - galactic - latitude northern sky was that of @xcite , updated in 1989 @xcite .",
    "more recently , the northern rosat all - sky ( noras ) galaxy cluster survey @xcite has provided an x - ray selected catalog covering a similar region , but with many fewer clusters , while the largest catalog using purely digital observations @xcite covers a smaller area , albeit with much better photometry .    because much improved optical data has become available , with automated techniques to generate objective , well - characterized cluster samples , we undertook the generation of a modern , optically selected cluster catalog , the northern sky optical cluster survey ( nosocs * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter papers i and ii ) , and its deeper extension ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "the need for a modern cluster survey covering a significant portion of the sky is striking .",
    "the catalog from paper ii has already been used to suggest a connection between short - duration gamma - ray bursts and clusters @xcite , to search for giant arcs @xcite , to associate compact groups and large - scale structure @xcite , and to examine x - ray and optical cluster properties @xcite . here",
    "we present the second and final installment of this catalog , including photometric redshifts , richnesses , optical luminosities and substructure measures . although superior imaging data is now available from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , @xcite ) , the imaged area covers less than half of the northern sky , and is not expected to ever reach the area coverage of our catalog .",
    "the currently published cluster catalog from sdss @xcite covers @xmath3 deg@xmath4 , containing nearly 14,000 clusters .",
    "that survey , using the maxbcg technique , has a lower redshift cutoff of @xmath5 ; our survey extends down to @xmath6 .",
    "this provides a sample of more local clusters whose properties can be examined in detail @xcite , especially using the extensive sdss spectroscopic database .",
    "the regions covered in this paper are shown in figure  [ plates ] .",
    "three separate areas are covered : ( 1 ) the well - calibrated north galactic pole ( ngp ) region already described in paper ii ( dotted lines ) ; ( 2 ) , the portion of the ngp with less well calibrated plates , not covered in paper ii ( solid lines ) ; and ( 3 ) , the southern galactic pole region ( sgp , dashed lines ) .",
    "the area covered by the ngp - poor region is 2813@xmath7 , while the sgp covers 2917@xmath7 .",
    "together with the 5681@xmath7 surveyed in paper ii , the final nosocs catalog covers 11411 square degrees .",
    "the distribution of clusters in the survey is shown in figures  [ alleq ] and  [ allgal ] , in equatorial and galactic coordinates , respectively .",
    "only clusters with richness @xmath8 are shown for clarity .",
    "the survey methodology is described in  2 .",
    "although the overall detection technique is very similar to that discussed in paper ii , we have modified our definition of bad areas due to very bright objects , reducing contamination by spurious detections .",
    "changes to the photometric redshift estimation yield more robust ( and realistic ) errors .",
    "the richness estimator has also been improved , providing robust error estimates , as well as total @xmath9-band optical luminosities .",
    "then , in  3 , we discuss two new sets of parameters computed for our cluster sample : estimates of cluster substructure and the dynamical radius @xmath1 .    in  4 we describe the general characteristics of our cluster sample , and present consistency tests for the three sky regions utilized .",
    "the selection functions describing the completeness as a function of richness and redshift are presented , as is an estimate of the contamination by projection effects .",
    "our complete and final cluster catalog , including an updated version covering the area from paper ii , is presented .",
    "this cluster sample is compared to other optically - selected catalogs in  5 .",
    "in particular , we compare our catalog to the sdss maxbcg catalog of @xcite , the only modern optical cluster catalog covering a similar area and redshift range .",
    "we then examine the correlation between our redshifts and richnesses and the x - ray measurements from the northern rosat all - sky galaxy cluster survey ( noras , @xcite ) .",
    "because noras consists of many fewer clusters than our catalog , we use our optical positions to measure x - ray fluxes and upper limits from rass for a significant subsample of nosocs .",
    "the detection of galaxy clusters in modern optical imaging surveys typically utilizes the existence of a tight color  magnitude relation for cluster galaxies , noted nearly half a century ago @xcite .",
    "surveys at low and high redshift have made use of this observation to efficiently detect clusters , while achieving low contamination ( false positive ) rates @xcite .",
    "we use the galaxy catalogs from the digitized second palomar observatory sky survey ( dposs , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the basis for our survey .",
    "unfortunately , the limited photometric accuracy ( @xmath10 at @xmath11 , @xcite ) of dposs forces us to rely solely on the two - dimensional projected galaxy distribution for cluster detection . details of the photometric calibration and star / galaxy separation are discussed in @xcite and @xcite respectively . in brief , the positions of the galaxies are used to generate adaptive kernel ( ak ) density maps @xcite which outputs images in units of projected galaxy density .",
    "we then run sextractor @xcite on these images , detecting peaks which are identified as potential galaxy clusters .",
    "we refer the reader to papers i and ii for more comprehensive descriptions of the cluster detection .",
    "photometric redshifts are estimated using the background - corrected mean @xmath9 magnitude and median @xmath12 color of the galaxies within a 0.5@xmath13mpc radius of the cluster center ; details on improvements to this estimator from our previous work are described below .",
    "the photometric redshifts are used to recenter the clusters , also discussed later .",
    "richnesses are computed by counting galaxies with @xmath14 within the same radius , with corrections applied for higher ( and now lower ) redshift clusters where the faint ( or bright ) end of this magnitude range is beyond our catalog limits .",
    "we note that galaxy colors are used only in the post - detection steps to estimate photometric redshifts for the clusters .      in the process of generating the catalog presented in paper ii , it became obvious that the dposs catalogs were insufficient for finding very bright stars and galaxies , which are typically deblended into numerous fainter components .",
    "in later work , paper iv utilized the tycho-2 catalog to excise candidate higher - redshift clusters in the area of bright stars after detection . to avoid spurious cluster detections due to these artifacts",
    ", we now rely on the tycho-2 and rc3 catalogs to exclude regions in the vicinity of bright objects _ before _ performing cluster detection .",
    "specifically , around bright stars we exclude circular regions whose area depends on the star s tycho magnitude ; @xmath15 radius for @xmath16 , @xmath17 for @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for @xmath20 .",
    "these radii were chosen by visually inspecting plate images and the resulting galaxy catalogs to determine the sizes of regions contaminated by the bright stars .",
    "in addition , larger regions around bright galaxies in the rc3 catalog @xcite were excised , corresponding to @xmath21 for @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 .    the removal of objects in these contaminated regions results in empty holes in the galaxy catalogs .",
    "an undesired consequence is that in these areas the adaptive kernel artificially increases the smoothing radius ( which is inversely proportional to the local density ) . to remedy this problem ,",
    "we generate simulated galaxy catalogs using the raleigh - levi distribution ( * ? ? ?",
    "* paper ii ) , and use these to fill the excised areas as well as the densitometry spot region on each plate . with this technique , the regions which would otherwise be empty instead contain galaxies with the average projected density for each plate .",
    "after cluster detection is completed , the final catalog is again checked against the list of bad areas . for some",
    "very extended , nearby galaxies , or very bright stars , we found through visual inspection that the exclusion area described above was not always sufficient .",
    "we therefore increased the radius of these areas , by a factor of 1.5 for the tycho-2 stars , and to @xmath25 for the rc3 galaxies .",
    "in addition , we created additional bad areas from catalogs of galactic globular and open clusters , as these objects were found to be contaminants in our previous catalogs .",
    "any candidates found within an exclusion radius defined by the sizes of these galactic clusters was also eliminated .",
    "visual inspection of candidates flagged in this last step shows that the vast majority were indeed bad .",
    "a total of 404 candidates , 2.5% of the sample , are removed from the catalog in this step .",
    "a number of small but significant changes were made to the algorithm presented in paper ii .",
    "these modifications enhance the photometric redshift measurements based on dposs photometry and provide more robust error estimates .",
    "first , we re - derived the empirical relation between the median @xmath12 color , mean @xmath9 magnitude of the cluster galaxies , and the spectroscopic redshift ( equation 1 in paper ii ) .",
    "this was prompted in part by modifications to the background estimator ( described below ) , which results in changes to the global properties of the cluster galaxy populations .",
    "our larger sky coverage also allowed us to restrict the spectroscopic cluster sample to those clusters with more than three concordant redshifts in the compilation of @xcite , resulting in a training sample of 254 clusters .",
    "we also found that the redshift estimator was more reliable when restricted to galaxies with @xmath26 , as opposed to @xmath27 used before .",
    "the recalibrated photometric redshift relation used here is @xmath28 with a @xmath29 , an improvement of @xmath30 over the results in paper ii .",
    "as noted above , one major modification to our technique involves measurement of the fore- and background galaxy contamination in the cluster area . in papers i and ii , we used color and magnitude distributions from each dposs plate ( @xmath31 deg@xmath4 ) , scaled to the area of each cluster on that plate , as the background correction .",
    "this ignores the contribution of local large scale structure to the background of each cluster , which can introduce systematic errors since galaxy colors and luminosities are strongly correlated with local density @xcite .",
    "we therefore implemented a local background estimator , as follows :    1 .",
    "a random position is chosen within a background annulus of width @xmath32 starting 3@xmath13 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "a box of size @xmath33 is placed at the random location 3 .",
    "a check is performed to see if the box intersects a bad area ( hole ) in the survey ; if so , we return to step 1",
    "the distribution of colors and magnitudes is generated for the galaxies in this box .",
    "the procedure is iterated until ten background regions are successfully measured .",
    "the @xmath34-clipped medians of the distributions from the ten background regions are used as the background correction for that cluster .",
    "the redshift estimator is run ten times for each cluster candidate .",
    "changes in the placement of the randomly located background measurement regions result in variations of the background galaxy color and magnitude distributions , which effect the final photometric redshift . by repeating the measurement",
    ", we derive an estimate of the random error in @xmath35 due to the background correction , which we then add in quadrature to the scatter from the redshift  photometric properties relation .",
    "although some of the latter is likely due to difficulties with properly estimating the background contribution , we prefer to estimate the redshift errors conservatively , adding the errors as if they were independent .",
    "we note that such problems are likely to be significantly reduced in modern digital imaging surveys , where the photometric errors are an order of magnitude smaller than for dposs @xcite . as a final change to the redshift estimator , we allow more iterations for convergence ( 15 instead of 10 ) .",
    "this was found to increase the number of successful redshift estimates , while allowing further iteration simply grew the computational requirements with little improvement .",
    "for some clusters , the photometric redshift estimator does not converge in all ten of the runs .",
    "the final photometric redshift is taken as the mean @xmath35 from the @xmath36 runs .",
    "the redshifts and their associated errors are provided in columns 5 and 6 of table  [ allclusters ] . for those clusters where the @xmath35 estimate always failed ,",
    "these three columns are all set to 0 .",
    "such clusters are likely to be spurious detections or have contaminated photometry from bright stars , telescope reflections or other artifacts .      during the photometric redshift measurement process",
    ", the cluster positions are also recomputed . at each iteration of the @xmath35 computation , we calculate the median position of the galaxies within a 1@xmath13 mpc radius of the previously determined center , and this is taken as the new cluster centroid for the next iteration of the photometric redshift estimation . to avoid large offsets , the maximum change in position is limited to 2 arcminutes ; if the recomputed center is further from the previous location , then the center is not moved .",
    "the above steps are repeated for each of the @xmath36 photometric redshifts , and the final cluster position is recorded as the mean of the corresponding @xmath36 positions . in those cases where the photometric redshift estimator does not converge ,",
    "we retain the original position ( from running sextractor on the density map ) .",
    "richnesses and luminosities are computed using the basic methods described in @xcite , with some further refinements , and adjusted for the lower redshift range probed here .",
    "the procedure consists of five steps for each cluster , described below .    1",
    ".   we use @xmath35 to determine the apparent magnitude @xmath37 , the aperture corresponding to 0.50 @xmath13 mpc , and the @xmath38-corrections @xmath39 and @xmath40 for elliptical and late - type galaxies ( sbc ) at the cluster redshift .",
    "we select all galaxies within 0.50 @xmath13 mpc of the cluster center and with @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath38-corrections are applied to individual galaxies at a later stage , so these limits guarantee that we select all galaxies that can fall within @xmath42 .",
    "the number of galaxies selected in the cluster region is n@xmath43 .",
    "we estimate the background contribution locally .",
    "we randomly select ten @xmath44 boxes ( avoiding bad areas ) in a 1.3@xmath45-wide annulus , starting 3 h@xmath46 mpc from the cluster center .",
    "galaxies are selected within the same magnitude range as used for computing n@xmath43 .",
    "the median counts from the ten boxes are scaled to the cluster area to generate the background estimate ( n@xmath47 ) .",
    "we adopt the interquartile range ( iqr , which is the range between the first and third quartiles ) as a measure of the error in n@xmath47 , which we term @xmath48 .",
    "the background corrected cluster counts ( n@xmath43 - n@xmath47 ) is called n@xmath49 .",
    ", a bootstrap procedure is used to statistically apply k@xmath50corrections to the galaxy populations in each cluster . in each of 100 iterations , we randomly select n@xmath49 galaxies from those falling in the cluster region ( n@xmath43 ) . an elliptical k@xmath50correction is applied to 80@xmath51 of the n@xmath49 galaxies , while an sbc k@xmath50correction is applied to the remaining 20@xmath51 .",
    "finally , we use these k@xmath50corrected magnitudes to count the number of galaxies with @xmath42 .",
    "the final richness estimate n@xmath52 is given by the median counts from the 100 iterations .",
    "the richness error from the bootstrap procedure alone is given by @xmath53 .",
    "the richness error is the combination of this error and the background contribution , so that @xmath54 = @xmath55 . at this point ,",
    "the richness error includes contributions from the @xmath38-correction and the background galaxy correction , but not the redshift uncertainty , which is incorporated in step 5 .",
    "if the cluster is too nearby or too distant , either the bright ( @xmath56 ) or faint ( @xmath57 ) magnitude limit , respectively , will exceed one of the survey limits ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "we then apply the appropriate incompleteness correction to the richness estimate : + @xmath59 + @xmath60 + we call @xmath61 and @xmath62 the low and high magnitude limit correction factors . 5 .",
    "the above steps are repeated using each of the @xmath36 photometric redshifts .",
    "the final cluster richness is recorded as the mean of the corresponding @xmath36 richnesses .",
    "we compute the mean of the richness errors from step 3 , as well as the dispersion among the richnesses from the @xmath36 iterations .",
    "the former quantifies how much richness variation we expect based solely on cosmic variance , assuming there is no error in the redshift estimates , while the latter reflects the richness error due to scatter in the photometric redshifts . because these are two independent sources of error , we add them in quadrature to derive the final richness error @xmath63 .",
    "total @xmath9-band luminosities ( in solar units ) and their errors are computed similarly to the richnesses .",
    "no attempt is made to fit and integrate luminosity functions for the individual clusters .",
    "the global contamination rate is estimated following @xcite . for each plate",
    ", we use the raleigh - levy ( rl ) distribution to generate @xmath64 x , y coordinates , where @xmath64 is the number of galaxies in the dposs catalog for plate @xmath65 . each galaxy in the rl catalog is assigned a magnitude selected randomly from the real data .",
    "the density mapping and cluster detection is performed on the rl catalog for each plate , and the detected clusters are assigned photometric redshifts at random from the real clusters in that plate . to estimate the global contamination rate for our sample , we ran this procedure on a plate - by - plate basis for the entire nosocs area .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ contam_allsky ] , where the top panel shows the distribution of real clusters ( solid line ) and false clusters ( from the rl simulations , dotted line ) , as a function of richness .",
    "the total contamination rate is 8.4% , consistent with our goal of achieving @xmath66 contamination when setting the cluster detection parameters .",
    "the bottom panel shows the contamination rate as a function of richness .",
    "for very rich clusters ( @xmath67 ) the contamination rate is negligible , and only rises above 5% for @xmath68 .",
    "the redshift- and richness - dependent completeness functions for each plate are provided in table  [ selfn ] .",
    "the first column gives the plate number ; for each plate , there are 42 entries , using six richnesses ( @xmath69 ) given in the second column , at seven redshifts ( @xmath70 to 0.32 with @xmath71 ) given in the third column .",
    "the fourth column gives the recovery rate ( in percent ) of clusters with the given richness , at the listed redshift , for that specific plate . to use a large cluster sample for cosmology requires knowledge of the mass - dependent selection function ( sf ) .",
    "currently , there are two methods to generate these , either by empirically calibrating a mass - observable relation , or using large simulations to construct mock galaxy catalogs from which clusters are selected .",
    "@xcite use the latter to estimate the purity and completeness of the sdss maxbcg cluster catalog , but we do not have such simulations corresponding to our data . using x - ray observations , we are in the process of developing an optimized richness estimator to generate an @xmath72 mass relation . however , that work is beyond the scope of this paper .",

    "furthermore , @xcite have used cosmological simulations to assess their completeness and false detection rate as a function of cluster mass .",
    "thus , their work can be used as a benchmark for the nosocs sample , which covers a larger sky area .",

    "first , we checked the sdss sample for clusters falling into any of our bad areas .",
    "only 141 of their 13,823 clusters ( 1.02% ) are eliminated in this way .",
    "this suggests that the sizes of our exclusion regions are reasonable , especially since the long exposures on the photographic plates yield larger saturated regions around bright stars than the shorter sdss exposures .",
    "we restrict our comparison to the ngp region bounded by @xmath147 since the sdss data covers only small strips in the sgp and does not extend to the northernmost declinations .",
    "a rectangular region is also trimmed from both catalogs to account for a missing stripe in the sdss area .",

    "leaves only 3,299 nosocs clusters .",

    "while a generally good correspondence is seen , there are clearly many clusters not in common to the two catalogs .",
    "the overall large scale structure , including filaments spanning tens of degrees , is well reproduced by both surveys .",
    "we first examine the recovery rate of our clusters in the maxbcg catalog .",
    "we simply search for the closest projected match to each nosocs cluster among the sdss clusters . the angular separation between matched clusters",

    "the top panels of figure  [ recoveryrates_bcg ] show the recovery rate of nosocs clusters by maxbcg as a function of matching radius and nosocs richness . for poor clusters ( @xmath149 )",
    "the recovery rate is low , even using large matching radii .",
    "this suggests that ( a ) maxbcg may fair poorly at detecting poor systems which have weak or no red sequence and no bcg , and/or ( b ) the contamination rate in our catalog is high for poor clusters . on one hand",
    ", the maxbcg catalog demonstrates a completeness of @xmath150 for @xmath151 @xcite , based on both monte carlo simulations where abell - type clusters are inserted into the data @xcite as well as cluster detection run on large mock catalogs @xcite .",
    "it is also nearly volume - limited and should therefore contain all such structures at @xmath152 ; however , the _ a posteriori _ limit of @xmath153 imposed on the published catalog is likely to have eliminated many poor systems that we detect . on the other hand , based on figure  [ contam_allsky ] ,",
    "only @xmath154 of poor nosocs clusters are expected to be false detections .",
    "the low recovery rate of poor nosocs clusters by maxbcg calls into question either one or both of these results , and requires further detailed study , especially using spectroscopic redshifts to determine the reality of these systems . we suspect that many of the poor systems we detect but not in the published maxbcg catalog may have maxbcg richnesses below their publication threshold .    more intriguing is the low @xmath155 recovery rate for very rich nosocs clusters .",
    "our estimated completeness is @xmath156 for @xmath67 out to @xmath157 @xcite , while the contamination rate is negligible for rich clusters .",
    "similarly , @xcite claim nearly 100% completeness for similar systems .",
    "examination of the unrecovered systems shows that they are typically at @xmath158 , as shown in the top panel of figure  [ notrecovered_bcg ] .",
    "this suggests that a combination of the strict _ a posteriori _ redshift limits imposed on the maxbcg catalog , along with the significant scatter in the nosocs photometric redshifts is responsible for a significant portion of the observed incompleteness .",
    "it is unlikely that richness errors cause this incompleteness , since the two surveys richnesses are well correlated .",
    "nevertheless , it will be important to carefully examine the rich systems found by only one of the techniques to understand potential biases .",
    "these comparison difficulties also show that applying _",
    "a posteriori _ limits ( in richness , redshift , or some other property ) to publicly available catalogs makes them troublesome ( if not impossible ) to use in such comparative studies .",
    "next , we reverse the sense of the comparison , examining the completeness of our catalog relative to that of @xcite . here",
    ", we use the maxbcg catalog as the fiducial source , searching for the nearest ( in projection ) nosocs cluster .",
    "angular separations are converted to physical distances using the maxbcg photometric redshifts .",
    "because the maxbcg catalog should be essentially 100% complete in the redshift range probed by nosocs , it provides a potential basis for testing our own completeness ( but see the caveats above ) .",
    "the results are shown in the top panel of figure  [ recoveryrates_bcg ] , with the recovery rate of maxbcg clusters by nosocs as a function of matching radius and maxbcg richness .",
    "it is immediately apparent that nosocs does extremely well at discovering rich clusters , finding 80 - 100% of the richest maxbcg clusters",
    ". measured this way , nosocs is more complete for the richest clusters than maxbcg , although this may be due to clusters falling below the @xmath159 limit imposed on the maxbcg catalog . however , for poor clusters and groups , the recovery rate is low .",
    "nearly half of the maxbcg clusters have @xmath160 , falling into the lowest richness bin in this plot .",
    "clearly , neither our algorithm nor that of maxbcg is anywhere near complete for group - mass systems .",
    "the bottom panel of figure  [ notrecovered_bcg ] shows that the nosocs completeness drops with redshift to @xmath161 , as expected for our flux - limited survey .",
    "nevertheless , the completeness is very high even for moderately poor systems to @xmath140 , consistent with the estimates shown in fig . 5 and 6 of @xcite .        beyond examining the completeness of these cluster catalogs , we use the more accurate maxbcg photometric redshifts to test our own estimates .",
    "we also examine the relationship between the nosocs and maxbcg richnesses .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ zcompare_bcg ] shows the comparison of photometric redshift estimators , as a function of nosocs richness , for nosocs clusters with a maxbcg counterpart within 0.75 mpc .",
    "the poorest clusters are shown as the smallest dots .",
    "open squares show the maxbcg photometric redshifts on the ordinate , and their spectroscopic redshifts on the abscissa . for poor clusters ( small dots ) ,",
    "the scatter between the two estimators is high , and the nosocs @xmath35 appears to underestimate the true redshift . for clusters with @xmath162 ,",
    "the scatter is dramatically reduced and there is only a small offset , which disappears for @xmath163 .",
    "these are quantified in the right panels of figure  [ zcompare_bcg ] , which shows the scatter ( top ) and median offset ( bottom ) between the two photometric redshift estimators , as a function of @xmath164 and the matching radius . assuming the maxbcg measurements are more accurate , we overestimate the redshifts of poor clusters .",
    "this may be due to the training sample used , which consists almost exclusively of abell clusters , which are much richer than these poor groups .",
    "furthermore , because of the minimum redshift ( @xmath159 ) imposed on the maxbcg sample , there is a bias at the low redshift end , where most of the poor nosocs clusters are detected .",
    "in fact , there are only two clusters in the sample with @xmath165 and @xmath166 matched within 750kpc .",
    "if we move to the next richness bin , @xmath167 , there are 115 clusters with @xmath168 , of which 80% are at @xmath169 .",
    "this effect is shown by the line and asterisk in the bottom right panel of figure  [ zcompare_bcg ] , where the median and scatter of the @xmath35 differences is computed only for those clusters with @xmath167 and @xmath168 , compared to the solid circle if no redshift cut is used . applying",
    "this limited redshift range reduced the median offset by @xmath170 .",
    "the number of galaxies in a cluster may be directly related to the underlying dark halo mass . if this is true , purely photometric cluster surveys are adequate to construct the cluster mass function , and in concert with photometric redshifts , measure its evolution .    to test the reliability of such richness estimates , we compare our richnesses to those from the maxbcg catalog .",
    "both surveys compute richnesses in fixed physical apertures as well as within @xmath1 .",
    "the results are show in figure  [ richcompare_bcg ] , where the left panel shows our @xmath110 ( within a 500kpc radius aperture ) versus maxbcg richnesses in the same aperture , and the right panel compares our fixed - aperture richness with maxbcg s @xmath89 richness .",
    "we only use clusters whose centroids agree to within 500 @xmath13 kpc between the two surveys , and with @xmath171 , resulting in a sample of 1,072 clusters .",
    "the small blue points show all matched clusters , while red points are those matches where the nosocs and maxbcg photometric redshifts differ by less than 0.03 .",
    "the large open squares show the medians in bins of width @xmath172 , along with the rms scatter .",
    "although there is a moderately large dispersion between our richnesses and those from maxbcg , they are well correlated .",
    "the solid lines in figure  [ richcompare_bcg ] show the best - fit relations :    @xmath173    and @xmath174    as expected , the richnesses computed within the same fixed apertures ( 0.5 mpc ) are much better correlated .",
    "however , these relations should not be used to convert between richnesses from the two surveys .",
    "the maxbcg catalog is censored at low richness ( where most of the clusters are found ) and the scatter in the relation is very high .",
    "much of the scatter is likely due to the different definitions of richness , where we count all galaxies while maxbcg effectively counts only galaxies along the e / s0 ridgeline . due to the large photometric errors in dposs",
    ", we can not replicate a richness using only the red - sequence galaxies .",
    "additional scatter is introduced by the different photometric redshifts changing the angular sizes of the apertures between the two surveys .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results of optical and x - ray cluster surveys , for the purposes of examining completeness and testing properties ( @xmath175 ) that might be useful as mass proxies .",
    "the largest existing x - ray survey in the northern hemisphere is noras @xcite , with 378 clusters at @xmath176 .",
    "noras is useful not only as the largest , homogeneous catalog of low - to - moderate redshift clusters , but also because spectroscopic redshifts have been obtained for the entire sample . to match this sample to nosocs",

    "this leaves a sample of 226 noras clusters for comparison , of which 175 are at @xmath177 , where we expect nosocs to be very complete .",
    "the top panels of figure  [ recoveryrates_noras ] show the recovery rate of x - ray selected clusters by our survey as a function of noras spectroscopic redshift ( left ) and x - ray luminosity ( right , for clusters with @xmath178 ) . at @xmath177",
    "we recover 80 - 95% of the noras clusters , depending on the matching radius , with a distinct drop at @xmath179 , as expected from our completeness functions . at high @xmath180",
    ", we recover 100% of the noras clusters , but they are few in number . at moderate @xmath180 ( @xmath181 erg s@xmath46 ) ,",
    "the recovery rate is quite stable near 80% , mostly due to clusters missed at higher redshifts .",
    "the bottom panels show the reverse comparison , the recovery rate of optical clusters , as a function of nosocs photometric redshift ( left ) and optical richness ( right ) . as with other optical cluster surveys",
    ", we have nearly two orders of magnitude more candidates than noras , resulting in a very low recovery rate of nosocs clusters in the x - ray . the recovery rate increases with redshift , as the fraction of poor clusters decreases in the optical .",
    "this effect is clearly illustrated in the bottom right panel , as the recovery rate approaches 50% for clusters with @xmath182 .",
    "nevertheless , it appears that noras misses over half of the richest clusters in our sample .",
    "the extensive spectroscopy for noras also allows an additional check on our photometric redshifts .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ nosocsnoras ] plots nosocs @xmath35 against noras @xmath183 , with matches within 0.5@xmath13 mpc shown in black , @xmath184 mpc in green , and @xmath185 mpc in red .",
    "for the 145 clusters matched within 0.5@xmath13 mpc , we find @xmath186 , consistent with the errors estimated from the photometric relation combined in quadrature with the background estimation errors .",
    "the recovery rates and typical offsets are also in good agreement with @xcite , who compared nosocs clusters to the more heterogeneous bax database .",
    "as seen in figure  [ nosocsnoras ] , x - ray measurements from noras are only available for a very small fraction of optically selected clusters .",
    "however , one can use the locations of optically selected cluster candidates to measure x - ray fluxes and luminosities from rass , allowing us to improve the optical  x - ray correlations .",
    "even though the significance of x - ray emission in these areas may be too low to identify extended sources in rass , we can derive either fluxes or upper limits following @xcite to generate a much larger dataset .",
    "we first restrict the nosocs sample to clusters at @xmath187 , the same redshift range used for substructure measurement .",
    "the optical richnesses are most reliable at these distances , where the luminosity function is completely sampled over the magnitude range used to derive @xmath110 .",
    "we further restrict the sample to clusters with @xmath138 , as we do for measuring @xmath89 , to avoid poor clusters / groups where the x - ray emission is unlikely to be detected or may be dominated by the x - ray halo of a single galaxy .",
    "the x - ray luminosities @xmath180 are estimated from count rates in rosat pspc images taken as part of the rass .",
    "images and exposure maps in the 0.4 - 2.4 kev band are retrieved from the rosat archive via ftp .",
    "we avoid the softest rosat channels ( 0.1 - 0.4 kev ) since the background is higher . to make our measurements comparable to those of @xcite , we follow an almost identical procedure .",
    "the background is estimated in an annulus with an inner radius of @xmath188 and width of @xmath189 , divided into twelve sectors .",
    "the median count rate from these sectors is used as the background , after removing any sectors containing point sources .",
    "the details of this procedure are described in  3.1 of @xcite .",
    "the cluster x - ray flux is then computed using fixed apertures of 0.5 and 1.0 @xmath13 mpc radius .",
    "we do not perform the growth curve analysis ( gca ) because the vast majority of nosocs clusters have very low x - ray fluxes , making the gca extremely unstable .",
    "the computed x - ray fluxes are then corrected for flux missing from the faint outer regions using the technique described in  3.5 of @xcite .",
    "finally , only clusters whose total counts are @xmath34 above the background are considered reliable . all others are reported as upper limits .",
    "the x - ray luminosities measured within fixed apertures of 0.5 and 1.0 @xmath13 mpc ( in units of 10@xmath139 erg s@xmath46 ) along with the associated errors and x - ray temperatures ( in kev ) can be found in table  [ lx ] .",
    "column 1 gives the cluster name , while columns 2 - 4 give the x - ray luminosity , luminosity error , and temperature , all derived within a 0.5 @xmath13 mpc aperture .",
    "columns 5 - 7 provide the same quantities measured using a 1.0 @xmath13 mpc aperture .",
    "luminosities marked with a `` : '' are upper limits .",
    "to test our methodology , we have recomputed @xmath180 for the entire noras and reflex @xcite samples using our software .",
    "we use the gca - derived apertures reported in those two surveys , along with the redshifts , missing flux corrections and plasma models taken directly from the respective samples . rather than transform between the different cosmologies used in noras and reflex , we perform all calculations with the cosmological parameters used in those surveys .",
    "to convert the measured total count rate to an unabsorbed x - ray flux in the full rosat soft energy band ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) , we use the pimms tool available through nasa heasarc .",
    "we assume a raymond - smith ( rs ) spectrum @xcite to represent the hot plasma present in the intracluster medium , with a metallicity of 0.2 of the solar value and the interstellar hydrogen column density along the line - of - sight taken from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the plasma temperature is estimated in two different ways .",
    "first , we use a fixed temperature of 5 kev , which is typical for clusters @xcite , and term the resulting luminosity @xmath190 .",
    "second , we use an iterative procedure relying on the @xmath191 relation from @xcite .",
    "we start by calculating @xmath190 and finding the corresponding temperature , assuming an rs spectrum .",
    "this new temperature is used to recalculate the luminosity based on an rs spectrum , and the procedure is iterated until convergence is reached , when the change in temperature is @xmath192 , comparable to the scatter in the @xmath191 relation .",
    "the procedure typically converges in two or three iterations . for both luminosity measures ,",
    "we apply a @xmath193-correction @xcite to derive the x - ray luminosity in the rest frame 0.1 - 2.4 kev band .    the only significant methodological differences between our technique and the previously published works are ( i ) we use the 0.4 - 2.4 kev images provided by the rosat archive , while they worked directly from the event files in the 0.5 - 2 kev range , ( ii ) we use a metallicity of @xmath194 instead of @xmath195 , and ( iii ) they derive an independent count rate to flux conversion while we rely on pimms",
    ". nevertheless , our results are in excellent agreement with both surveys .",
    "the comparisons to noras and reflex are shown in the top and bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ usvboh ] , respectively .",
    "we find very small offsets of @xmath196 in @xmath180 between our measurements and the literature values , likely due to differences in the count rate to flux conversion .",
    "the scatter is small , @xmath197 over a very broad range of @xmath180 , demonstrating that we are able to correctly recover x - ray luminosities with our technique .",
    "four examples of the optical and x - ray properties are shown in figure  [ optxray ] , where we overlay contours of x - ray emission from the rass on dposs @xmath198-band images of four clusters in our catalog .",
    "the images are 0.5@xmath45 on a side , centered on the nosocs optically - selected cluster centers .",
    "the clusters range in richness from @xmath199 , and redshifts of @xmath200 .",
    "there are 6 x - ray contours evenly spaced between the background level and @xmath201 over the background .",
    "a circle of radius @xmath202 is plotted , centered on the x - ray flux centroid .",
    "although evident in the optical images , the x - ray fluxes are clearly not very high , and even moderately rich clusters near the median redshift of our catalog ( such as the one at top right in the figure ) do not stand out strongly .",
    "the x - ray contours are usually well matched to the optical center , except for the top left cluster .",
    "visual inspection of the galaxy distribution in the latter field shows that the nosocs cluster center is in between two apparent overdensities which have been blended in our catalog , and only one of which is x - ray detected .",
    "this suggests that searching for clusters with highly discrepant optical and x - ray positions and/or fluxes can be used to find such projections .",
    "the comparison of optical richness and our estimate of @xmath180 from the iterative procedure described above is shown in figure  [ ngallx ] , using 1649 clusters with @xmath203 , @xmath204 and successfully measured x - ray luminosities with @xmath205 ergs s@xmath46 .",
    "clusters where the x - ray luminosity is only an upper limit and those where the background estimation failed are not included .",
    "individual clusters are plotted as dots , while the binned results ( with each bin containing 200 clusters ) along with their @xmath206 scatter are shown as the large points with error bars .",
    "while the scatter is large , the binned relationship agrees with that found by @xcite using higher quality x - ray data , @xmath207 .",
    "we also show , as the solid line , the relationship between @xmath180 within 750 kpc and @xmath208 from the x - ray stacking analysis performed by @xcite using the maxbcg cluster catalog ( their equation 5 ) , but simply replacing @xmath208 with our @xmath110 .",
    "the power - law slopes of the @xcite and @xcite relations are nearly identical , despite the completely different richness measures .",
    "as seen in figure  [ ngallx ] , a similar relationship holds for our clusters , despite rosat s limited spatial resolution and count rate as well as the limited photometric accuracy and depth of dposs , demonstrating that a reliable cluster sample can be defined from such data .",
    "it is also possible transform our @xmath110 to the maxbcg @xmath208 using eqn . 7 , and plot the relation from @xcite using this pseudo-@xmath208 ;",
    "this is shown as the dashed line in figure  [ ngallx ] .",
    "we caution that this is not a reliable conversion because the richness transformation is difficult and @xcite use a completely different prescription for computing @xmath180 .",

    "compared independently detected x - ray and optical clusters from the same patches of sky .",
    "they found poor correlation between optical richness and x - ray luminosity , but could not pinpoint the physical reason for this , and pointed out the need to understand the effect of this scatter on mass selection .",

    "however , it is worth noting that their sample remains one requiring x - ray detections , which was shown by @xcite to potentially bias the results .",

    "furthermore , our ability to measure x - ray luminosities for hundreds of clusters not originally detected in the rass argues for improved multi - wavelength detection methods that leverage multiple surveys ( optical , infrared , x - ray , s - z ) to find distant and/or poor clusters which would otherwise fall below the significance cutoff in a single passband .",
