    ", @xcite , @xcite . studying cosmological models instead of general relativity helps us to overcome the problems related to the infinite number of degrees of freedom in the theory and pay more attention to the issues arising from the time reparametrization invariance of the theory ; such as the identification of a dynamical time and also construction of observables for the theory @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in particular",
    ", bianchi ix cosmological model is an interesting candidate to test the possible solutions of the above problems @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the problem of time is the most known difficulty of the wheeler - dewitt ( wdw ) quantum geometrodynamics which is a theoretical basis for modern quantum cosmology @xcite , @xcite .",
    "time in quantum mechanics and general relativity are drastically different from each other ; in quantum mechanics time is a global and absolute parameter , in general relativity a local and dynamical variable @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the wave function in quantum formulation is time independent , i.e. , the universe has a static picture .",
    "a common candidate for a dynamical time in classical and quantum model is a massless scalar field coupled to gravity @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in this work",
    "we apply this to bianchi ix cosmological model and investigate its classical and quantum implementation . due to the presence of the minimally coupled scalar field term in the formulation , we show that the dynamics of the metric functions can be obtained using a time variable , as a function of the scalar field .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in section two the hamiltonian formulation of bianchi ix model coupled to a massless scalar field is studied , with particular attention to the closed frw model . in section three",
    "the canonical quantization of the model is presented and the wave function of the universe is discussed .",
    "again special attention is given to the quantum frw cosmological solutions with closed curvature .",
    "section four presents conclusion drawn from this work .",
    "the characteristic feature of the bianchi ix model is the existence of the simply transitive isometry group .",
    "the infinitesimal generators of this group are the three linearly independent spacelike killing vectors , @xmath0 which obey @xmath1 = { c_{ij}}^k \\xi_k,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 runs from 1 to 3 .",
    "the generators of these transformations are @xmath5 one may write the metric of bianchi ix in terms of _ forms _ , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the lapse function , @xmath8 is the 3-metric and the @xmath9 are the left invariant _",
    "1-forms _ of @xmath10 : @xmath11 with @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    without lose of generality",
    ", we can assume that the metric @xmath8 is diagonal .",
    "using the misner variables to parameterize the metric @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are functions of time only .",
    "the matrix @xmath18,\\ ] ] with the property @xmath19 , ensures that the 3-volume of the hypersurface depends only on the conformal factor @xmath16 .",
    "the variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 describe the anisotropy of the spacetime , and , in particular , if they equal to zero , the model reduces to the ordinary closed frw model .    the hilbert action for the model , including the massless scalar field minimally coupled to gravity , is given by @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 runs from 1 to 4 and @xmath25 .",
    "if one assume that the scalar field is spatially homogeneous , the lagrangian for the model in terms of the misner variables becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 for the hamiltonian formulation of the theory , let s determine the conjugate momenta to the dynamical variables @xmath16 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath28 , and @xmath7 : @xmath29 obviously , the variable @xmath7 is not a canonical variable as its canonical conjugate momenta is zero .",
    "the canonical hamiltonian can then be written as @xmath30 with the total hamiltonian to be @xmath31 since @xmath32 is a primary constraint , preservation of this constraint over time yields a secondary constraint ( called hamiltonian constraint ) , @xmath33 + \\frac{e^{-3\\alpha}{p_\\phi}^2}{2 } \\approx 0.\\ ] ] by choosing @xmath34 and introducing a new variable @xmath35 , ( @xmath36 is scale factor ) we can redefine the secondary constraint as @xmath37 + \\frac{{p_\\phi}^2}{2 } \\approx 0,\\ ] ] where @xmath38 . thus @xmath39 in which according to dirac procedure , both of these constraints are first class .",
    "now , we define a new time variable and its conjugate momenta as @xcite : @xmath40 @xmath41 where the integration is over the spatial hypersurface @xmath42 . the hamiltonian constraint in terms of the new variables becomes @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the hamiltonian constraint without scalar field .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath45 , @xmath46 shows that the time variable equals the four - volume enclosed between the initial and final hypersurfaces , which is necessarily positive and monotonically increasing and can play the role of a cosmological time . even though , the time variable is not a dirac observable , it can be used to play the role of a cosmological time .",
    "besides , the conjugate momentum to this variable is a dirac observable .",
    "classically , we can analyze in which sense the dynamical time , @xmath45 , can be regarded as an appropriate time variable for the theory . near the cosmological singularity @xmath47",
    "the potential term @xmath48 can be neglected and so we have @xmath49 + \\pi_t \\approx 0.\\ ] ] in such approximation we obtain the new equations of motion @xmath50 which , @xmath51 , denotes derivative of @xmath52 , with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "the solutions to the above system for the scale factor @xmath36 and its conjugate momenta are @xmath53 where @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a constant . a positive @xmath56 with positive @xmath57 provides an accelerating expanded universe , with a positive constant hubble , @xmath58 .",
    "we have recovered a monotonic dependence of our new variable @xmath45 with respect to the isotropic variable of the universe @xmath36 and therefore @xmath45 shows to be a relational time variable for the gravitational dynamics . in this case",
    ", the universe expands exponentially according to the cosmological time variable , and naturally accelerating without a beginning singularity .    in the presence of the potential term ,",
    "i.e. , far from the singularity , the equations of motion are @xmath59 , \\\\ { \\beta_+ } ' & = & -\\frac{1}{12}p_+ , \\\\ { \\beta_- } ' & = & -\\frac{1}{12}p_- , \\\\ { p_+ } ' & = & -4a^4[-e^{-8\\beta_+ } + e^{-2\\beta_+}\\cosh(2\\sqrt3\\beta_-)\\nonumber \\\\ & + & e^{4\\beta_+}(\\cosh(4\\sqrt3\\beta_-)-1 ) ] , \\\\ { p_- } ' & = & -4\\sqrt3a^4[-e^{-2\\beta_+}\\sinh(2\\sqrt3\\beta_- ) + e^{4\\beta_+}\\sinh(4\\sqrt3\\beta_-)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although , it is hard to solve these set of coupled nonlinear differential equations analytically , a numerical solution of the equations shows , in particular , the dynamic of the scale factor in terms of the time variable @xmath45 ( fig.1 ) .",
    "again , we have recovered a monotonic dependence of our new variable @xmath45 with respect to the isotropic variable of the universe @xmath36 and the universe expansion begins with no singularity .    ]",
    "@xmath60 :    in particular , we are more interested to find the behavior of the isotropic variables @xmath36 and @xmath61 when @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we find the equations of motions as , @xmath64 and @xmath65    the nontrivial solution of the above coupled non linear differential equations  ( [ aprime ] ) and ( [ pprime ] ) , for the scale factor gives @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are positive constants of integrations .",
    "this solution shows that the universe has no singularity at all .",
    "besides , the universe shrinks to a big crunch as @xmath45 goes to infinity while it reaches a maximum size during its history .",
    "note that , in the isotropic limit , the bianchi ix model contains the closed frw model and the behavior of the scale factor @xmath36 is as expected for this model .",
    "in quantization of the theory , we obtain the wheeler - dewitt equation @xmath69 or @xmath70 so , we get a schrdinger like equation @xmath71 where the new variable plays the role of a dynamical time for the theory . explicitly , the schrdinger equation can be written as : @xmath72\\psi = i\\hbar\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\psi,\\ ] ] where we have ignored the potential term in this regime .",
    "in fact , in quantum cosmology , the universe is described by a single wave function @xmath73 providing puzzling interpretations when analyzing the differences between ordinary quantum mechanics and quantum cosmology .",
    "if we consider the universe wave function as : @xmath74 then , by using separation of variables method we obtain @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , @xmath4 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are arbitrary constants .",
    "the solutions to these equations are : @xmath82 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 are normalisation coefficients",
    ".    for the hamiltonian operator to be self adjoint the wave function must satisfy one of the following boundary conditions @xcite , @xcite @xmath87 the first boundary condition is satisfied while the second one leads to infinity . obviously , the wave function is not square integrable and in order to obtain a possible physical solution we may construct wave packets as  @xcite @xmath88 however , the wave packets are also problematic and a satisfactory solution to the wdw equation is not easy to obtain .",
    "@xmath60 :    in the case of isotropic universe , the associated wheeler - dewitt equation , i.e. , the schrdinger - like equation is @xmath89 the solution is @xmath90,\\ ] ] where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are constants of integrations , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are bessel functions and @xmath95 . since @xmath94 grows exponentially to infinity as @xmath36 goes to zero , one must set @xmath96 , and consequently the first boundary condition ,  ( [ boundary1 ] ) , is satisfied . in this isotropic case",
    "the wave function is still not square integrable and even using wave packets does not give us a satisfactory wave function for the universe .",
    "in this work , we present the hamiltonian formulation of the bianchi type ix cosmological model minimally coupled to a scalar field . we show that the dynamics of the metric functions can be obtained using a time variable , @xmath97 , as a function of the scalar field .",
    "we then apply the results for the classical and quantum models .",
    "we find that the classical model has solutions which avoid the usual initial cosmological singularity .",
    "particularly , in a positive curvature spacetime , the solution also shows a big crunch in future . in the quantum description of the model , however , a satisfactory wave function is difficult to be physically interpreted . even in the case of isotropic bianchi type ix model ,",
    "it is not easy to find a normalisable solution to the wdw equation ."
