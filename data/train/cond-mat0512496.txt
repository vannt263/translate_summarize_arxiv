    "the pseudogap state appears even in lightly doped regions of @xmath6 ( na - ccoc ) and @xmath7 ( bi2212 ) , where the pseudogap is of an asymmetric , v - shaped type at very low temperatures and has been referred to as the zero temperature pseudogap ( ztpg).@xcite it was recently revealed by stm / sts studies that in the ztpg regime a nondispersive @xmath3 charge order appears in the two - dimensional ( 2-d ) spatial map of energy - resolved differential tunneling conductance @xmath8 , which is proportional to the local density of states ( ldos).@xcite a nondispersive @xmath9 charge order , electronic in origin , was also reported in the ldos maps measured in the pseudogap state of bi2212 at @xmath10.@xcite such a spatial structure in the ldos maps was first observed around the vortex cores of bi2212 exhibiting pseudogap - like v - shaped sts spectra with no peaks at the gap edge.@xcite such charge orders have attracted much attention because the charge order can be a possible electronic hidden order in the pseudogap state.@xcite    in measurements of ldos maps in the superconducting ( sc ) state of bi2212 , hoffman _",

    "the observation of almost the same charge order for both cuprates na - ccoc and bi2212 provides definite evidence that the nondispersive @xmath3 charge order develops on the cu - o layer .",
    "the @xmath3 charge order is likely to be dynamical in itself , and pinned down over regions with effective pinning centers.@xcite to understand the nature of the nondispersive @xmath3 charge order , it is desirable to investigate the charge order on crystals with different doping levels and/or pinning centers of different natures .    in the present work , we studied the nondispersive @xmath3 charge order from stm measurements on bi2212 crystals with different doping levels and/or pinning centers of different properties .",
    "we found that low doping tends to favor the development of the @xmath3 charge order though it would be dynamical without pinning centers .",
    "we also studied the sts spectra over the same region where stm images were taken , and point out that the spatially inhomogeneous gap structure , often reported in sts measurements on high-@xmath5 cuprates,@xcite will correlate with the appearance of the pinned @xmath9 charge order .",

    "excess oxygen atoms contained within bi - o bilayers provide cu - o layers nearby with mobile holes .",
    "however , excess oxygen atoms will be appreciably lost during the process of cleaving the crystal at high temperatures .",

    "when the resolution of stm tip - scanning depends on wave - vector and happens to be very poor at @xmath96 , @xmath97 , the @xmath3 charge order observed in stm experiment will be smeared and seemingly weakened , although the underlying lattice ( each atom ) can be observed clearly .",
    "in such a case , even if the pairing gap is spatially inhomogeneous in itself , it will appear homogeneous in sts experiments . because the gap structure will be averaged over a wide area on account of poor spatial resolution of sts tip - scanning .",
    "such a situation might be in samples b , d and f , whose @xmath3 charge order is weak and gap structure is homogeneous .",
    "then , in order to examine whether the spatial resolution of tip - scanning is high enough for observing the @xmath3 charge order in the present study , we focus on the 1-d superlattice , whose wave vector @xmath98 points to @xmath99 direction with @xmath100 .",
    "this is because 2-d charge order s wave - vectors @xmath101 , @xmath102 have a similar component ( @xmath103 ) to the 1-d superlattice s wave - vector ( @xmath104 ) in the @xmath99-direction . as shown in fig .",
    "[ superlattice ] , the ft spots associated with the 1-d superlattice clearly appear not only in sample c exhibiting intense @xmath3 charge orders but also in sample d exhibiting weak @xmath3 charge order .",
    "similar results were also obtained for other sample pairs ( a , b ) and ( e , f ) .",
    "these results indicate that there is no essential difference in the spatial resolution of stm / sts tip - scanning ( @xmath98 and @xmath105 ) among samples a to f. hence the @xmath3 superstructures in samples b , d and f will not be weakened by poor spatial resolution of the tip - scanning but intrinsically weak .",
    "we can also examine the spatial resolution of the tip - scanning from the spatial dependence of the pairing gap .",
    "as mentioned above , if spatial resolution of stm tip - scanning is very poor , the spatial dependence of the gap is seemingly homogeneous in sts experiments , even though the gap structure is intrinsically inhomogeneous .",
    "in such a case , the observed homogeneous gap would be essentially the same as the spatially averaged one of inhomogeneous gap data , which could be obtained in sts measurements with good spatial resolution of sts tip - scanning . to check this point",
    ", we compare the the spatially averaged gap obtained for sample c with the averaged gap for sample d , because the doping levels of both samples are almost the same , as mentioned above",
    ". however , fig .",
    "[ stsd](b ) shows that the peak structure of the averaged gap is quite different between samples c and d ; the peaks of sample d are evidently higher and sharper than those of sample c. the averaged gaps of samples e and f also show a similar tendency ( fig .",
    "[ stsf](b ) ) .",
    "these indicate that the homogeneous gap structures of samples d and f will be intrinsic , not caused by poor spatial resolution of stm / sts tip - scanning .",
    "( a ) and ( b ) . here the peak - intensities for samples c and d were normalized with their bragg - peak intensities .",
    "the line cuts were taken along @xmath106-@xmath107 lines around the bragg spots , as shown by dotted boxes in the inset .",
    "the inset is the 2-d fourier map for sample d shown in fig .",
    "[ ftcde](a ) , although its contrast is enhanced so that the fourier spots associated with the 1-d superlattice will clearly be visible in the inset[superlattice ] ]      in high-@xmath5 cuprates , since gap width @xmath78 largely depends on doping level @xmath13 , the value of @xmath78 measured by sts provides information about doping level @xmath13 of cu - o layers near the cleaved surface.@xcite gap width @xmath78 of sample a , exhibiting the intense @xmath3 charge order , is larger than that of sample b , exhibiting the weak @xmath3 charge order locally .",
    "this means that surface doping level @xmath13 of sample a is lower than that of sample b , although both samples were cut from the same single crystal @xmath15 . furthermore , low - bias stm imaging of slightly underdoped bi2212 with @xmath108 mev exhibits no @xmath3 charge order , as was previously reported.@xcite these results indicate that low doping tends to favor the development of the @xmath3 charge order , at least , in the present study .    doping level @xmath13 of sample b is lower than that of sample c , because @xmath78 of sample b is larger than that of sample c ( figs .",
    "[ stsb ] and [ stsc ] ) .",
    "therefore , a more intense @xmath9 charge order could be expected to appear in sample b , compared with the charge order of sample c. however , the @xmath3 charge order of sample b is weak and only appears locally in the low - bias stm image , whereas sample c exhibits an intense charge order throughout its entire low - bias stm image ( figs .",
    "[ stmb](a ) and [ stmcd](a ) ) .",
    "in addition to this result , the @xmath3 charge order is much weaker in sample d than in sample c , although the doping level is not so different between the samples , as mentioned above .",
    "these results indicate the possibility that doping level will not be the only crucial factor necessary for the development of the nondispersive @xmath3 charge order ; there will be some other important factors in addition to the doping level .",
    "it should be emphasized here that sample b shows homogeneous sts spectra with a @xmath88-wave gap , as mentioned above .",
    "the specific , homogeneous @xmath88-wave gap in sample b means that doping level @xmath13 is rather homogeneous and hole - pairs are uniformly formed throughout cu - o layers in this sample .",
    "these results suggest that the @xmath3 electronic charge order will develop dynamically throughout cu - o layers , and it will be pinned down locally over the region with effective pinning centers in sample b. the pinning of the dynamical charge order will enable us to observe it in stm measurements . from the standpoint of this pinning picture , the marked difference of the @xmath3 charge order between samples c and d , with similar doping levels , can be explained as the difference in the density and/or strength of pinning centers .",
    "the bi2212 crystals used in the present study belong to the pseudogap regime . in the pseudogap regime",
    ", the fermi surface can be classified into coherent and incoherent parts ; the former is centered at the nodal point of the @xmath88-wave gap and often referred to as `` the fermi arc '' , whereas the latter is around the antinodes , that is , outside the fermi arcs ( fig .",
    "[ fermiarc]).@xcite this heterogeneous structure of the fermi surface in the pseudogap regime can provide a possible reason why parts of quasiparticle and/or hole - pair states become inhomogeneous in the intense , pinned @xmath3 charge order state ; the incoherent electronic states around the antinodes , where the pseudogap develops at @xmath10 , are easily modified by external perturbation caused by the randomness associated with pinning potential of the charge order .    from the standpoint of the present pinning picture ,",
    "the @xmath3 charge order can be expected to appear in stm images when the incoherent quasiparticle states around the antinodes ( outside the fermi arcs ) contribute to the stm tunneling . in samples with fermi arcs of a finite size , namely moderately underdoped samples , no @xmath3 charge order will appear in the stm images at very low biases , where only coherent quasiparticles with very low excitation energy on the fermi arcs contribute to the stm tunneling ( fig .",
    "[ intensity ] ) .",
    "however , the @xmath3 charge order will appear at higher biases , where incoherent quasiparticles with high excitation energies outside the fermi arcs contribute to the stm tunneling , as observed experimentally in samples c and e ( fig .",
    "[ intensity ] ) . on the other hand , in heavily underdoped samples",
    "a and b with very tiny fermi arcs , it is plausible that the @xmath3 charge order appears in stm images even at very low biases .",
    "this is because there are incoherent quasiparticle states with very low excitation energies just outside the tiny fermi arcs , and they contribute to the stm tunneling even at very low biases .",
    "we performed low - bias stm imaging on underdoped sc bi2212 crystals , and confirmed that the nondispersive @xmath3 electronic charge order appears within the pairing gap at @xmath11 .",
    "the present nondispersive charge order is consistent with the findings in the ldos maps for the sc state of bi2212 by howald _",
    "et al . _ and for the pseudogap state ( @xmath10 ) by vershinin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite howald _",
    "et al . _ have claimed that the nondispersive charge order results from the formation of the stripe order , though this scenario does not so straightforwardly explain why the observation of the @xmath3 charge order is restricted to within the pairing gap.@xcite the appearance of the charge order within the pairing gap is not inconsistent with the models of pair density waves , electronic supersolids , paired - hole wigner crystallization , or the coexistence of multi - type sc and spin density wave.@xcite on the other hand , vershinin _ et al . _",
    "have claimed that the nondispersive @xmath9 charge order at @xmath10 is a hidden order of the electron system in the pseudogap state ( @xmath10).@xcite in that case , the observation that the nondispersive charge order survives even in the sc state means that the hidden order of the pseudogap state will remain essentially unchanged down to below @xmath5 .",
    "it is urgently desired to elucidate how the charge order in the pseudogap state ( @xmath10 ) evolves into the nondispersive one in the superconducting state .",
    "we pointed out the possibility that the sample dependence of the nondispersive @xmath3 charge order can be understood qualitatively from the standpoint of the pinning picture , which indicates that the @xmath3 charge order will be dynamical in itself and pinned down over regions with effective pinning centers .",
    "the dynamical @xmath3 charge order is a possible candidate for the hidden order in the pseudogap regime of pure bulk crystals with no effective pinning centers .",
    "we also pointed out that the pairing gap of samples exhibiting more intense , pinned @xmath3 charge order is spatially more inhomogeneous .",
    "the inhomogeneous gap structure can be attributable to incoherent electronic ( quasiparticle ) states around the antinodes , where the pseudogap develops at @xmath10 .",
    "the electronic ( quasiparticle ) states will be largely modified there by randomness associated with the pinning potential of the @xmath3 charge order .    thanks to useful discussions for professor f. j. ohkawa , professor z. teanovi and professor k. maki .",
