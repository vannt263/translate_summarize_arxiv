    "colliding beams of heavy ions at energies per nucleon in the range @xmath2 gev , corresponding to experiments rhic at brookhaven , and lhc at cern , suggested that intense electromagnetic fields of these ions can produce relatively large fluxes of muons and tauons .",
    "since mass of the electron ( 0.511 mev ) is much smaller than muon ( 105.66 mev ) and tauon ( 1784 mev ) , and the compton wavelength of the electron ( 386 fm ) is much larger than muon ( 1.86 fm ) and tauon ( 0.11 fm ) , the cross sections of producing electron pairs are much larger than the heavy leptons .",
    "in addition to this , since the compton wavelengths of muons and tauons are smaller than the radius of the colliding heavy ions ( au , pb ) , nucleon @xcite and nucleus form factors are not negligible . therefore realistic charge form factors play important roles for calculating the cross sections of the heavy lepton pair productions .    in this work ,",
    "we have used wood - saxon nucleus form factor which is also widely used in literature @xcite . instead of the monopole approximation , we have an analytical expression of the wood - saxon form factor in our equations . with the help of this analytical equation , we are able to account for the neutron skin and its effects to our calculations .",
    "the determination of the sizes and shapes of atomic nuclei is one of the important problems in nuclear physics .",
    "the rms radius of the charge distribution in nuclei is well known with the high degree of accuracy achieved by the elastic electron - nucleus and muon - nucleus scattering experiments .",
    "the experimental uncertainties for the nuclear charge radius are about @xmath3 for several nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , the neutron distribution and its rms radius in nuclei is not precisely determined theoretically and experimentally .",
    "generally , the neutron skin thickness , defined as the neutron - proton rms radius difference in the atomic nucleus , @xmath4 where the measured charge radius are @xmath5 fm for the gold nucleus and @xmath6 fm for the lead nucleus @xcite . by using the parity - violating electron scattering ( pves ) , the recent experiment @xcite at jlab gives us the value @xmath7 as @xmath8 .",
    "the difference between the radii of the neutron and proton distributions is the neutron skin and it is equal to @xmath9 fm for the lead nucleus with large total error .",
    "therefore the difference between the distributions of protons and neutrons in the nucleus affects the cross section of the heavy lepton pair production .    to explore a surface thickness of the neutron density in a heavy nucleus , we model the neutron density with a wood saxon form : @xmath10\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the parameters that determine the shape of the neutron distribution .",
    "although the same parameters are precisely determined for the proton distribution in the heavy nucleus , there are large uncertainties for the neutron distribution . in this work",
    ", we study the effect of these parameters to the heavy lepton pair production cross sections .",
    "although the electron - positron pair production from electromagnetic fields goes back to 1930s @xcite , there are numbers of published literature in the 1990s and 2000s @xcite .",
    "the main motivation at these period was the rhic .",
    "dilepton production from the central collisions of heavy ions is very important to understand the hadronic interactions .",
    "however electromagnetic production of dileptons from the peripheral collisions of heavy ions can shield those dileptons produced from the hadronic interactions .",
    "therefore it is highly important to understand various properties of the electromagnetically produced dileptons @xcite .    in our previous works @xcite ,",
    "we have calculated electron - positron pair production cross sections by using the second order feynman diagrams . in this work ,",
    "we have modified the equations by including the electromagnetic form factors of nuclei in the momentum space .",
    "we have used fermi type charge form factor .",
    "we also consider the coherent production of heavy lepton pairs in two photon limit for the symmetric collision of two gold nuclei at rhic and two lead nuclei at lhc energies . in fig .",
    "[ f20 ] , the wiggly lines are the virtual photons that make the electromagnetic field of the colliding ions . here",

    "we take the classical limit of the motion of the ions which yields the external field model .",
    "since the parameter @xmath13 is not small , coulomb and unitarity corrections should be included to obtain exact cross sections .",
    "this calculations has been done in @xcite , and we will also mention briefly in the results section .        in the formalism section ,",
    "we briefly explain two photon pair production mechanism . in calculations and tables section ,",
    "we study the effects of the form factor that we use in our calculations and we also calculate a variety of cross sections for the single - pair process . finally on the last section , we summarize all the work that we have done in this manuscript .",
    "in this work we will investigate the two - photon mechanism for heavy lepton pair production . in fig .",
    "[ f21 ] , the electromagnetic interaction of the colliding ions is shown .",
    "since all the protons in the nucleus act coherently , there is a very strong electromagnetic field appears around the heavy ions @xcite .",

    "the minimum electric field needed are @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",

    "even for the impact parameters around @xmath33 regions , maximum electric field is smaller than the electric field that produce tauon pairs at rhic and lhc energies .",

    "since the contribution of the last term in above equation is very small compare to the first term , it is safely neglected . by changing the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 we can estimate the sensitivity of the nucleon distributions in the nucleus .",

    "the cross section ( @xmath147 ) of the produced muon pairs decreased by about @xmath148 at rhic and @xmath149 percent at lhc .",
    "similarly , tauon production decreased by about @xmath150 at lhc and @xmath151 at rhic . on the other hand , when we change the radius @xmath0 from from @xmath152 to @xmath153 , the cross sections of the muon pairs decreased by about @xmath154 at lhc and @xmath155 at rhic .",
    "the similar calculation shows that tauon production decreased by about @xmath156 at lhc and @xmath157 at rhic .",
    "these calculations are tabulated in table iii . from this calculations , we can conclude that wood - saxon distribution function is more sensitive to the parameter @xmath0 compare to the parameter @xmath1 .",
    "it also shows that , cross sections are very sensitive to the parameter @xmath0 at rhic energies compare to the lhc energies . the proton distribution in the nucleus is well known .",
    "if the neutron surface is shifted outwards the proton surface this means that the skin depths of neutrons and protons are nearly equal @xmath158 and it is called @xmath159 or @xmath160 type of neutron skin . on the other hand , if the diffuseness of the neutron surface is greater than the proton then @xmath161 and it is called @xmath162 or @xmath163 type of the neutron skin @xcite .    we have compared our results with the works done in ref.@xcite .",
    "both cross section results of the rhic for @xmath97 production nearly agree each other , however @xmath102 cross section in our work approximately is @xmath164 times larger than their results .",
    "our lhc cross section results of @xmath97 and @xmath102 productions are slightly higher than their results .",
    "authors in ref.@xcite they used gaussian distribution form factor and the equivalent photon approximation to calculate the heavy lepton pair production cross section .",
    "when we compare our cross section results with ref.@xcite , both calculations for @xmath97 production at rhic energies are almost similar with and without form factor at rhic energies , @xmath102 cross section with no form factor in our work approximately is @xmath165 times lower than in ref.@xcite , however the results with form factor is close to each other .",
    "our cross section results of @xmath97 rates at rhic and lhc are about slightly lower than in ref.@xcite that is used born calculations at rhic and lhc energies .",
    "since the parameter @xmath13 is not small , coulomb and unitarity corrections @xmath166 should be included in the calculations to obtain exact cross sections . in ref.@xcite authors",
    "show that for electron positron pair production , the coulomb corrections to the born cross section are large , whereas the unitary corrections are small . on the other hand , for muon pair production the coulomb corrections to the born cross section ( corresponding to multiphoton exchange of the produced muon pairs with the nuclei ) are small , whereas the unitary corrections ( corresponding to the exchange of light - by - light blocks between nuclei ) are large .",
    "authors find that for @xmath167 collisions at lhc there is about @xmath168 unitarity corrections to the born cross sections .",
    "in this work , we investigate the contribution of the wood - saxon nuclear form factors on the heavy lepton pair production .",
    "we study the pair productions for the rhic and lhc energies for the au and pb nucleus .",
    "even though electron pair production is not strongly effected by the form factors , the calculations show that nuclear form factors play important role for the muon and tauon pair production . at rhic and lhc energies ,",
    "muon pair production is reduced by about 3 and 2 factors by the au and pb form factors , respectively . on the other hand , at rhic and lhc energies ,",
    "tauon pair production is reduced by about 100 and 5 factors by the au and pb form factors , respectively .",
    "these calculations show that tauon pair production is very sensitive to the form factors at the rhic energies .",
    "we can conclude that , muon pair production in peripheral heavy - ion collisions is coherent greater than the dimensions of the nucleus .",
    "however , although for the lhc energies the tauon pair production is coherent over distances of the dimension of the nucleus , for the rhic energies this coherence is break down .",
    "since the mass of the tauon is very large when compared to muon , incoherent pair production of tauon is dominant at the rhic energies .",
    "when the energy is increased , the coherence pair production is restored .",
    "we expect that this result is also valid for the other heavy particles .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of the neutron distributions in the nucleus to the cross section of the heavy lepton pair production .",
    "neutron skin can be produced in two ways : first type is as a result of the shift of the neutron surface in relation to the proton one ( the  bulk  or `` skin '' type @xmath158 ) , and the second type is due to the differences in the surface thickness of proton and neutron matter in a nucleus ( the  surface  or `` halo '' type @xmath161 ) . in general , both types of mechanisms contribute to the creation of neutron skin .",
    "we have changed the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the wood - saxon form factor , and our calculations show that wood - saxon distribution function is more sensitive to the parameter @xmath0 compare to the parameter @xmath1 ."
