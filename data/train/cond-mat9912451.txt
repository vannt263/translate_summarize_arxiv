    "doped manganites , with chemical formula _ r_@xmath11_a_@xmath12mno@xmath4 [ _ r_= la , nd , pr , and _ a_= ca , sr , ba ] , have attracted lots of attention due to their exotic transport and magnetic properties , such as colossal magnetoresistance.@xcite the coexistence of ferromagnetism and metallicity , for the samples near @xmath13 @xmath1 0.3 , had been explained by the double exchange model.@xcite however , it was found that the double exchange interaction alone can not explain the colossal magnetoresistance.@xcite additional mechanisms were proposed . among them , two scenarios attracted most of attention : the polaron due to the jahn - teller distortion of mn@xmath14 ion@xcite and the orbital fluctuation.@xcite    on the other hand , some manganite samples with small bandwidths near @xmath13 @xmath1 1/2 show intriguing charge ordering phenomena,@xcite i.e. real space orderings of the mn@xmath14 and the mn@xmath15 ions . for manganites , the charge ordering is usually accompanied with orbital and antiferromagnetic ordering . for example , charge ordering in nd@xmath3sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 leads to the _ d_@xmath16 ( _ d_@xmath17 ) orbital ordering and the _ ce_-type antiferromagnetic spin ordering at a low temperature.@xcite moreover , it was found that some charge ordered states could be changed into ferromagnetic metallic states at a higher temperature and/or under a high magnetic field.@xcite the transitions from charge / orbital ordered insulator to ferromagnetic metal are usually called  melting  of charge / orbital ordered states .",
    "there have been numerous optical investigations which tried to understand basic mechanisms of colossal magnetoresistance.@xcite however , only a few works have been reported for optical responses of the charge / orbital ordered state.@xcite recently , okimoto _",

    "we carefully annealed the sample again in an o@xmath21 atmosphere at 1000 @xmath22 just before optical measurements.@xcite    near normal incident reflectivity spectra were measured from 5 mev to 30 ev.@xcite a fourier transform spectrophotometer was used for 5 mev @xmath23 0.8 ev , and a grating monochromator was used for 0.6 @xmath1 7.0 ev . above 6 ev",
    ", we used the synchrotron radiation from the normal incidence monochromator beam line at the pohang light source .",
    "after the spectra were taken , the gold normalization technique was used to subtract surface scattering effects . in the frequency region of 5 mev @xmath1",
    "4 ev , the @xmath5-dependent reflectivity spectra were taken using the liquid - he cooled cryostat . in the same frequency region ,",
    "the @xmath6-dependent reflectivity spectra were taken with spectrophotometers at national high magnetic field laboratory .",
    "the kramers - kronig analyses were used to obtain @xmath5- and @xmath6-dependent optical conductivity spectra @xmath24 . for these analyses , the room temperature reflectivity spectrum in the frequency region of 4 @xmath1",
    "30 ev was smoothly connected .",
    "then , the reflectivity at 30 ev was extended up to 40 ev , above which @xmath25 dependence was assumed . in the low frequency region ,",
    "the reflectivity spectrum below 5 mev was extrapolated to be a constant for an insulating state or using the hagen - rubens relation for a metallic state.@xcite to check the phase errors due to the extrapolations in the kramers - kronig analyses , we also independently measured optical constants in the frequency region of 1.5 @xmath1 5 ev using a spectroscopic ellipsometry .",
    "it was found that the data from the spectroscopic ellipsometry measurements agreed quite well with the kramers - kronig analyses results , demonstrating the validity of our extrapolations .",
    "figure 1(a ) shows the @xmath5-dependent _ dc _ resistivity curve of nd@xmath3sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 which was taken with @xmath6 = 0 t. with decreasing @xmath5 , the _ dc _ resistivity value slightly decreases near the ferromagnetic ordering temperature @xmath26 ( @xmath1 250 k ) , but it increases abruptly near the charge ordering temperature @xmath27 ( @xmath1 150 k ) .",
    "the _ dc _ resistivity value at 4.2 k is estimated to be around 200 @xmath28 cm .",
    "this large value of the _ dc _ resistivity is known to be originated from real space charge / orbital ordering .",

    "the _ dc _ value does not change down to 7.5 t and starts to increase abruptly near 7.5 t. the _ dc _ resistivity curve shows a very strong hysteresis below 13 t : the _ dc _ resistivity values for the field - decreasing run are quite smaller than those for the field - increasing run .",

    "at room temperature ( i.e. @xmath30 ) , there are two broad peaks near 1.0 and 4.0 ev . when entering into the ferromagnetic metallic state ( i.e. @xmath31 ) , the broad 1.0 ev peak shifts to a lower energy , which accompanies large spectral weight changes .",
    "in addition , there is a small decrease of the spectral weight near 3.0 ev . interestingly , even at a highly metallic state near 170 k , optical conductivity decreases below 0.5 ev and shows the drude - like behavior below 0.1 ev .",
    "when entering into the charge / orbital ordered state ( i.e. @xmath32 ) , the spectral weights move to the opposite direction : namely , from a low to a high energy region . the optical conductivity spectrum at this charge / orbital ordered state shows an opening of optical gap , whose value is estimated to be about 0.1 ev .",
    "[ this value is in reasonable agreements with the value obtained from recent photoemission experiments.@xcite ] in addition , the spectral weights near 3.0 ev are restored approximately to the values at @xmath30 .",

    "such changes in the phonon spectra can be understood in terms of the strong lattice distortion due to the charge / orbital ordering.@xcite      the @xmath6-dependent @xmath24 , which were taken at 4.2 k , are shown in fig .",

    "the gap values seem to decrease and finally disappear above 13 t. note that the @xmath6-dependent spectral weight changes are similar to the @xmath5-dependent spectral weight changes near @xmath35 .",
    "however , the spectra in the ferromagnetic metallic state of 17 t clearly show a drude - like absorption feature , which is somewhat different from @xmath24 of the ferromagnetic metallic state at 170 k , displayed in fig .",

    "interpretations on @xmath24 of perovskite manganites have been quite different among experimental groups.@xcite however , a correct interpretation is essential to understand physics of the colossal magnetoresistance and the charge / orbital ordering phenomena .",
    "recently , we proposed a schematic diagram of @xmath24 based on the polaron scenario,@xcite which seems to explain most features of optical transitions in colossal magnetoresistance manganites observed by numerous group.@xcite we want to extend the schematic diagram to include the charge / orbital ordered state .",

    ", there are four main contributions for @xmath24 below 5 ev : ( i ) @xmath36 due to a small polaron absorption below 1.0 ev , ( ii ) @xmath37 due to an inter - orbital transition between the jahn - teller splitted levels of the mn@xmath14 ions near 1.5 ev , ( iii ) @xmath38 due to an optical transition between the hund s rule split bands near 3.0 ev , and ( iv ) @xmath39 due to a charge transfer transition from the o 2_p _ band to the mn 3_d _ band near 4.5 ev .",

    "the coherent absorption will appear as drude - like optical conductivity spectra @xmath48 and the incoherent one as an asymmetric mid - infrared peak .",
    "the increase of electron screening and the decrease of lattice distortion in the metallic state will decrease the 1.5 ev peak somewhat .",
    "the optical transition between the hund s rule splitted bands will decrease , since all of the _",
    "t_@xmath46 spins will be aligned in the ferromagnetic state . and , the charge transfer peak remains to be nearly @xmath5-independent .",
    "below @xmath27 , the coherent absorption of the free carrier will disappear due to the charge / orbital ordering . and",
    ", its spectrum will be similar to that for @xmath30 .",
    "however , there seems to be three minor but important differences .",
    "first , the optical gap due to charge / orbital ordering should appear .",
    "second , the absorption peak due to the polaron hopping should decrease since such a hopping requires more energy in the antiferromagnetic ordered state .",
    "third , the 1.5 ev peak should become stronger , since lattice distortion becomes larger in the charge / orbital ordered state .      for the quantitative analysis of @xmath5-dependent electronic structure , we analyzed @xmath24 in terms of five peaks , discussed in section iv .",
    "a :    @xmath49    for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , the lorentzian functions were used .",

    "the solid circles represent the experimental @xmath24 after subtracting @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath50 .",
    "the fitting results with the gaussian functions could explain the experimental data quite well .",
    "using the integration of each gaussian function , we derived the @xmath5-dependent optical strengths , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , for peak i and peak ii , respectively .",
    "we also obtained the strength of the drude weight @xmath55 by integrating the corresponding drude peak .",
    "the @xmath5-dependences of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are displayed in figs .",
    "6(a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) , respectively .",

    ", @xmath56 starts to increase below @xmath26 and abruptly decreases below @xmath27 .",
    "when the sample becomes ferromagnetic below @xmath26 , it becomes metallic .",
    "then , the polaron hopping contribution @xmath53 and the free carrier contribution @xmath55 should increase due to the alignment of _",
    "t_@xmath46 spins . due to the increase of metallicity , the lattice distortion of the mno@xmath47 octahedron will become reduced , resulting in decrease of @xmath54 .",
    "when the sample becomes antiferromagnetic below @xmath27 , the polaron hopping requires more energy and @xmath53 should decrease .",
    "the reduction of the metallicity makes @xmath54 increase and @xmath55 become zero very rapidly .",
    "these temperature dependences are explained in the schematic diagram in fig .",
    "4 .    according to the polaron picture , the @xmath5-dependence of @xmath56 can be explained more quantitatively . in ( la , pr)@xmath60ca@xmath61mno@xmath4 ,",
    "whose ground state is a 3-dimensional ferromagnetic metal , it was found that @xmath56 could be scaled with the @xmath5-dependent double exchange bandwidth @xmath62 @xmath63:@xcite    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the relative angle of neighboring spins and @xmath66 represents thermal average in the double exchange model.@xcite this scaling behavior was explained in a model by rder _",

    "the agreement between @xmath67 and @xmath62 @xmath63 is quite good .",
    "however , @xmath67 deviates from @xmath62 @xmath63 below @xmath27 .",
    "this deviation might be explained by a strong suppression of polaron absorption due to the _ ce_-type antiferromagnetic ordering at the low temperature region . in the _ ce_-type configuration ,",
    "e_@xmath45 conduction electrons are allowed to hop along the ferromagnetically aligned zigzag chains forming an effective 1-dimensional ferromagnet . in the 3-dimensional ferromagnet above @xmath27",
    ", the polaron hopping is allowed to six neighboring mn sites with parallel spins .",
    "but , in the 1-dimensional ferromagnetic chain , the polaron hopping is allowed only along the zigzag chain .",
    "therefore , the transition from the 3-dimensional ferromagnet to the 1-dimensional zigzag chain will strongly suppress the polaron absorption near @xmath27 .      with the fitting process used in section iv .",
    "b , we obtained @xmath6-dependent changes of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 , at 4.2 k. figure 7 shows the results of such fittings , and all of the optical strengths show strong hysteresis behaviors . during the field - increasing run , @xmath53 increases near 13 t and becomes nearly saturated above 14 t. during the field - decreasing run , @xmath53 remains nearly the same down to 8 t and then abruptly decreases .",
    "note that the value of @xmath53 at @xmath2 0 t after the completion of one cycle is larger than the initial value of @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath54 is nearly opposite to that of @xmath53 , but the @xmath6-dependence of @xmath56 is similar to that of @xmath53 .",
    "contrary to rather smooth changes of @xmath53 , @xmath68 , and @xmath56 , the change of @xmath55 is rather abrupt : the value of @xmath55 becomes nearly zero below 13 t for field - increasing run and below 7 t for field - decreasing run .",
    "qualitatively , the @xmath6-dependences of @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 , are quite similar to the @xmath5-dependences of the corresponding strengths below @xmath27 .",
    "these @xmath6-dependences can be explained using the schematic diagram in fig .",
    "values of @xmath56 at 4.2 k with various values of @xmath6 were shown in fig .",
    "6(d ) . the open circle , the asterisk , the solid triangle , and the solid square represent values of @xmath56 at 0 , 12 , 13 , and 17 t , respectively . with increasing @xmath6",

    "note that the change in @xmath7 is rather abrupt near the insulator - metal boundary .",
    "such interesting behaviors of @xmath7 can be observed more clearly in the @xmath6-dependence .",
    "up to the insulator - metal phase boundary ( @xmath1 13 t ) , @xmath7 is increased and then abruptly decreased .",
    "the changes of @xmath7 and @xmath70 at 100 @xmath59 under various @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "9(a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "these figures also show strong hysteresis behaviors .",
    "the solid circles and the solid squares represent data during the field - increasing and the field - decreasing runs , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the abrupt change in @xmath7 occurs near the insulator - metal transition .",
    "note that @xmath7 becomes large as the transition region is approached both from the insulating and from the metallic sides .",
    "the divergence of @xmath7 near the insulator - metal transition has appeared in numerous models .",
    "according to the herzfeld criterion,@xcite valence electrons are considered to be localized around nuclei and contribute to atomic polarizability .",
    "near the insulator - metal transition , the polarizability diverges , so @xmath7 should also diverge . above the transition , the restoring force of the valence electron vanishes , resulting in free carriers .",
    "another is the anderson localization model.@xcite the polarizability of a medium is proportional to square of localization length .",
    "since the localization length diverges near the insulator - metal transition , @xmath7 should diverge .",
    "[ however , it is clear that the insulator - metal transition in nd@xmath3sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 is not induced by disorder . ]",
    "note that both of the above microscopic models deal with @xmath7 mainly in dc limit , so our infrared data can not be well explained . and , it was found that vo@xmath21 films experienced an insulator - metal transition of the first order nature around 70 @xmath71c , and that their mid - infrared properties could be explained by a composite medium model which takes into account the evolution of domain growth during the first order phase transition.@xcite in the composite medium model , the increase of @xmath7 near the insulator - metal transition can be interpreted as a dielectric anomaly related to percolation .",
    "therefore , we decided to apply the effective medium approximation ( ema ) , which is a composite medium model predicting a percolation transition .      in ema , it is assumed that individual grains , either metallic or insulating , are considered to be embedded in a uniform background , i.e. , an  effective medium  which has average properties of the mixture.@xcite a self - consistent condition such that the total depolarization field inside the inhomogeneous medium is equal to zero leads to a quadratic equation for an effective dielectric constant @xmath72 ,",

    "the percolation transition occurs at @xmath79 .    to apply ema",

    ", we evaluated @xmath72 for various values of @xmath80 .",
    "the predictions of ema are shown in fig .",
    "if @xmath81 ( i.e. in the insulating side ) , @xmath82 increases when the insulator - metal transition is approached . if @xmath80 becomes larger than 1/3 , the low frequency value of @xmath83 suddenly becomes negative . by comparing with fig .",
    "8(a ) and ( b ) , it is clear that the ema results can explain the @xmath5-dependent and the @xmath6-dependent @xmath7 quite well .",
    "it should be noted that the percolation model can also explain the increase of @xmath7 near the insulator - metal transition . near the percolation ,",
    "effective capacitive coupling between the metallic clusters increase due to an increase of effective area and the decrease of spacing between the metallic clusters .",
    "this increase of coupling results in the increase of @xmath7 near the percolation transition .",
    "therefore , it can be argued that the insulator - metal transition in nd@xmath3sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 occurs through a percolative phase transition .",
    "recently , there have been lots of studies on the phase separations in doped manganites.@xcite our picture of the percolative phase transition agrees with such phase separation . the ema calculation in fig .",
    "8(c ) shows that the metallic domain can exist in the insulating states , i.e. , below 150 k without @xmath6 , or below 13 t at 4.2 k. and it also shows that the insulating domain can exist in the metallic states of nd@xmath3sr@xmath3mno@xmath4 .",
    "the origin of the phase separations in doped manganites remains controversial .",

    "these spectral weight changes are discussed with polaron picture and local charge / orbital ordering . moreover , using the analyses of dielectric constants , we showed that the melting of charge / orbital ordered states occurs through the percolation in the ferromagnetic metal domains and that optical conductivity should be explained by the two - phase coexistence picture between charge / orbital ordered insulator and the ferromagnetic metal domains .",

    "<S> these spectral weight changes could be explained using the polaron picture . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our results suggested that some local ordered state might remain above the charge ordering temperature , and that the charge / orbital melted state at a high magnetic field ( i.e. at @xmath2 17 t and @xmath0 4.2 k ) should be a three dimensional ferromagnetic metal . </S>",
    "<S> we also investigated the first order phase transition from the charge / orbital ordered state to ferromagnetic metallic state using the @xmath5- and @xmath6-dependent dielectric constants @xmath7 . in the charge / orbital ordered insulating state , @xmath7 was positive and @xmath8 . with increasing @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 was increased up to the insulator - metal phase boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> and then , @xmath9 abruptly changed into negative and @xmath10 , which was consistent with typical responses of a metal . through the analysis of @xmath7 using an effective medium approximation , we found that the melting of charge / orbital ordered states should occur through the percolation of ferromagnetic metal domains .    </S>",
