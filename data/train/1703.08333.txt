    "inflation @xcite provides a well motivated framework to address some of the remaining challenges facing the cosmological standard model @xcite , such as the flatness and horizon problems , as well as the absence of cosmological relics and the origin of cosmological fluctuations . according to the paradigm of slow - roll inflation @xcite , inflationary dynamics",
    "is described by one ( or several ) scalar field(s ) called inflaton(s ) .",
    "if the potential for such scalar field is flat enough , then its dynamics will produce a source of negative pressure , which is required to sustain a phase of cosmological exponential acceleration .",
    "although it is not possible to test inflation in a model independent way , it may be said that current observational data @xcite generally supports the inflationary paradigm and constrains the dynamics of candidate inflationary models .    over the past decades",
    "many proposals for inflationary models have been put forward @xcite .",
    "many of these theoretically viable models , including the simplest chaotic models based on polynomial potentials such as @xmath3 or @xmath4 , have recently been excluded by cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) data from the planck satellite @xcite . the most recent data favours inflation models with purely gaussian fluctuations , a spectral index @xmath5 and low tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath6 . of the surviving classes of models , some are based on non - minimal gravity , such as the @xmath7 inflation model starobinsky @xcite , although similar predictions arise in higgs inflation @xcite and related models @xcite , as well as low scale inflation models based on hybrid inflation @xcite .",
    "however , many of the surviving models suffer from being sensitive to possible ultra - violet ( uv ) physics .",
    "if not protected by symmetry , generic corrections to the potential can provide an @xmath8 contribution to the slow - roll parameter @xmath9 spoiling the predictions required for a successful inflation .",
    "this is known as the @xmath9-problem @xcite , and is a theoretical challenge facing any inflationary model .",
    "supersymmetry ( susy ) has been extensively used in inflationary models , since such theories generally allow better control over the high energy dynamics of scalars @xcite . in particular , according to the lyth bound @xcite , low values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath10 imply that the scale of inflation should be less than the planck scale , and susy provides a mechanism for maintaining a hierarchy of scales without fine - tuning .",
    "the first implementations of supersymmetric models of inflation considered only global susy .",
    "but since the dynamics of inflation occur at early stages of the history of the universe and is sensitive to uv scales , it is necessary to also consider local susy or supergravity ( sugra ) ( for recent sugra inflation models see for example @xcite ) . in sugra",
    "the so - called @xmath11-term scalar potential is sensitive to the shape of the khler potential , and this can lead to the re - emergence of the @xmath9-problem in the presence of quadratic contributions to the khler potential .",
    "one solution to this problem is no - scale sugra @xcite , where the khler potential takes a logarithmic form and circumvents the above problem .",
    "no - scale sugra models are so - called because the scale at which susy is broken is undetermined in the first approximation , and the scale of the effective potential responsible for inflation can be naturally much smaller than the planck scale , as required .",
    "alternatives to no - scale sugra have also been proposed , for example using a non - compact heisenberg symmetry @xcite or a shift symmetry @xcite .",
    "recently , it was shown that , within a wess - zumino framework , where the superpotential consists of quadratic and cubic terms only @xcite , no - scale sugra can behave like a starobinsky inflationary model @xcite ( see also @xcite for a realisation within an @xmath12 model , and for other no - scale inflation realisations @xcite ) .",
    "such a model was shown to be the conformal equivalent of an @xmath13 model of gravity for a particular point in parameter space , and at this point , starobinsky inflation was shown to emerge . however , in the above approach , the mechanism of susy breaking was left unspecified , and formally the gravitino mass is zero in the starobinsky limit .    in this paper",
    "we consider the above model of ellis , nanopoulos , olive ( eno ) @xcite , together with a linear polonyi term to the superpotential .",
    "the purpose of adding this term is to provide an explicit mechanism for breaking susy .",
    "if the polonyi term is dropped , the model will reduce to the eno model with starobinsky inflation in a particular limit .",
    "including a polonyi term , we shall show how one may successfully perturb away from the starobinsky limit of the eno model , whilst maintaining successful inflation and at the same time generate a gravitino mass with a strict upper bound @xmath0 tev , with favoured values @xmath1 tev .",
    "the model suggests that susy may be discovered in collider physics experiments such as the lhc and the fcc .",
    "this work is organised as follows . in section  [ noscale ]",
    "we review the no - scale khler potential and the general result for the supergravity potential . in section  [ wzp ]",
    "we give the superpotential of our model and present the inflationary potential and find its global minimum . in section  [ inflation ]",
    "we discuss inflation and analyse the parameter space of the model , showing how this leads to an upper bound on the gravitino mass .",
    "section  [ conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "an important part of model is described by the khler potential alone , namely the kinetic term and a simple formula for the scalar potential can be found using only the khler potential .",
    "the no - scale khler potential is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a modulus field and @xmath16 is another field in the hidden sector which will be responsible for inflation and susy breaking .",
    "the kinetic term depends on the second derivatives of the khler potential , or khler metric given by , @xmath17 using eqs.[k],[kij ] , we find the kinetic term in the lagrangian , @xmath18    in order to proceed we follow the procedure in eno @xcite , where it is assumed that the @xmath15 modulus is fixed ( or stabilised ) by some other mechanism to be equal to a constant value , so that its derivatives vanish .",
    "then only the ( 1,1 ) element of the matrix in eq.[matrix ] is non - zero , where this element depends on the real vacuum expectation value of the @xmath15 modulus , @xmath19 the canonical normalisation of the remaining @xmath16 kinetic term is somewhat non - trivial to achieve since it is multiplied by a function of @xmath20 .",
    "however , the problem has been solved by eno @xcite who change variables from @xmath16 to @xmath21 where , @xmath22 in terms of which the kinetic term reads @xmath23      ( \\partial_\\mu \\chi^*)(\\partial^\\mu \\chi ) \\ .\\ ] ] in the limit @xmath24 we get a canonically normalised kinetic term for @xmath25 , which is identified as the inflaton in this limit .    leaving every dimension explicit ,",
    "the supergravity potential is given by @xmath26    where the supergravity @xmath11 term is given by @xmath27    using these results one finds , for any choice of superpotential @xmath28 , the potential : @xmath29    the last result manifests the main characteristic of a no - scale model that the potential is positive semi - definite .",
    "another important quantity is the gravitino mass @xmath30 , whose square is given by @xmath31 where the quantities are to be evaluated at the ground state vacuum , and the second equality above assumes that @xmath32 at the minimum .",
    "both the potential and the gravitino mass depend crucially on the superpotential @xmath28 to which we now turn .",
    "the superpotential of our model consists of a wess - zumino model with quadratic and trilinear terms , of the kind considered in eno @xcite , together with a new linear polonyi term that we are adding in order to break susy :    @xmath33 in the limit that @xmath34 , the polonyi term vanishes and the model reduces to the wess - zumino model considered by eno .",
    "using @xmath28 in eq.[w ] , the potential in eq.[vf ] becomes , @xmath35    since the potential is positive semi - definite , it is minimised for @xmath32 .",
    "the minimum of the potential is given by setting the numerator equal to zero , leading to a quadratic equation for @xmath16 with solution , @xmath36    using the reparametrisation of the field as in eq.[chi ] , @xmath37 and writing @xmath21 in terms of its real and imaginary parts @xmath38 the potential in eq.[v ] becomes , @xmath39    where @xmath40 for real parameters , we have checked that the potential is always minimised by @xmath41 for any value of @xmath42 in the range of interest for inflation .",
    "moreover , we have checked that the steepness of the potential in the @xmath43 direction always exceeds that in the @xmath42 direction in the range of interest .",
    "setting @xmath41 , we then identify the inflaton as @xmath42 , with the inflationary potential @xmath44    the value of @xmath42 at the global minimum of the potential is @xmath45 which can also be obtained from eq.[eq : vevz ] . without loss of generality , for concreteness we will choose the lower sign , so that inflation will happen with @xmath42 rolling from @xmath46 .    the eno limit amounts to taking @xmath47 , which means @xmath48 . without loss of generality , we take @xmath49 to be positive and take the lower sign in eq.[eq : vevx ] .",
    "then , in the limit @xmath48 , we find that @xmath50 , which also means @xmath51 and hence @xmath52 at the end of inflation .",
    "then , since @xmath32 at the global minimum , and the @xmath11 term is zero , susy is unbroken , and the eno limit implies a massless gravitino according to eq.[m32 ] .    in the eno limit , starobinsky - like inflation",
    "is found in the further limit that @xmath53 which in our case would account to take @xmath54    therefore , starobinsky - like inflation results from the limiting case of the above potential formula : @xmath55 in these limits , inflation occurs at @xmath56 .",
    "as we can see in figure [ fig : potential ] , keeping @xmath57 , a small value for @xmath58 represents a small deviation from the starobinsky limit of the eno model .",
    "this means that we can expect a successful inflation scenario very similar to starobinsky inflation for small values of @xmath58 .",
    "this is of interest since , for non - zero @xmath58 , susy is broken and the gravitino mass becomes non - zero at the end of inflation .    , keeping @xmath57 . as @xmath58 deviates from zero , the value of the field at the global minimum @xmath59 shifts away from zero , while maintaining @xmath32 . for small values of @xmath58",
    "the potential retains a plateau where inflation will happen .",
    "[ fig : potential],scaledwidth=75.0% ]",
    "first we introduce the usual inflation functions .",
    "the potential slow - roll parameters are dimensionless and read @xmath60 and @xmath61 where prime means derivative regarding the inflaton field , @xmath42 .    from these we can derive two crucial dimensionless observables , the tensor - to - scalar ratio , @xmath10 , @xmath62 and the scalar tilt , @xmath63 , @xmath64    a last observable is the scalar amplitude , which reads + @xmath65 which is the only observable sensitive to the overall scale of the potential , i.e. of the parameter @xmath66 .",
    "furthermore , in order for inflation to be successful the dynamics of the inflaton has to significantly increase the scale factor .",
    "this is accounted by the n - folds quantity , that reads + @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the field value at which inflation starts , and @xmath69 the value at the end of inflation , which we can safely approximate by @xmath59 , the field value at the global minimum of the potential .    in the following",
    "we shall take the starobinsky - like inflationary limit while allowing for a non - zero polonyi term , @xmath70 in order for the potential to stabilise the scalar component of @xmath16 with vanishing imaginary component , @xmath43 , we enforce that eq.[eq : vevx ] is real . in the limit",
    "@xmath57 this accounts for the constraint @xmath71 with @xmath72 . in their paper , eno showed that deviations from @xmath57 limit will change the shape of the potential and the range of the predictions of inflationary parameters without altering the massless nature of the gravitino .",
    "therefore , we expect gravitino masses to be proportional to the value of @xmath58 and in henceforth keep the @xmath57 limit .     on @xmath58 , with fixed @xmath73 .",
    "[ fig : m32b],scaledwidth=75.0% ]    in order to study the inflationary dynamics , we need to specify the values for @xmath74 such that @xmath75    since @xmath76 , the above conditions do not fix @xmath66 . for",
    "that we use the central observational value for scalar spectrum amplitude , @xmath77 .",
    "therefore , we need only to scan a two - dimensional parameter space @xmath78 to study the inflationary dynamics of our model . in figure",
    "[ fig : m32b ] we show the dependency of @xmath30 on @xmath58 , with fixed @xmath73 .",
    "we have rescaled the results around the origin to show that for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , which is the eno model limit .    in figure",
    "[ fig : m32nsandr ] we show the results of a scan over the parameter space @xmath78 , in the @xmath81 and @xmath82 planes .",
    "these results show that successful inflation can be achieved for a gravitino mass satisfying the strict upper bound @xmath83 gev , with favoured values @xmath84 gev .    in figure  [ planck ]",
    "we show the subset of @xmath85 predictions , applying the restriction @xmath84 gev , in the plane of the latest planck results .     and @xmath82 planes , as a result of a scan over the parameter space @xmath78 , keeping @xmath57 .",

    "the small endpoint of the yellow bar represents @xmath86 , while large endpoint represents @xmath87 .",
