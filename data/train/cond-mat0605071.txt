    "optical signatures of spin - singlet @xmath2 and spin - triplet @xmath3 charged excitons are commonly observed in semiconductor nanostructures in magnetic fields . despite the status of @xmath0 as one of the simplest few - body systems with coulomb interactions and a large amount of experimental and theoretical work , some important issues remain unresolved .",
    "one of these issues is the degree of localization of charged excitons in realistic quantum wells ( qw s ) and how localization of @xmath0 manifests itself in optics @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss exact selection rules that govern transitions of charged excitons in magnetic fields .",
    "we also demonstrate , on a quantitative level , how these selection rules work when applied to free @xmath0 and donor - bound @xmath6 charged excitons ; the latter can also be considered as excitons bound to a neutral donor @xmath7 .",
    "classification of states of free charged electron - hole complexes in magnetic fields is based on magnetic translations and the axial symmetry about the magnetic field axis @xcite .",
    "the corresponding orbital quantum numbers are the oscillator quantum number @xmath8 and the total angular momentum projection on the @xmath9-axis , @xmath10 .",
    "the former has the meaning of the mean squared distance to the orbit guiding center ; there is an infinite - fold landau degeneracy in @xmath11 .",
    "each family of degenerate @xmath0 states starts with its parent @xmath12 state that has some specific value of @xmath10 that follows from the solution of the schrdinger equation .",
    "degenerate daughter states @xmath13 have values @xmath14 for the total angular momentum projection .",
    "selection rules for interband transitions are @xmath15 and @xmath16 and lead to the following results : photoluminescence ( pl ) of a free @xmath0 must leave an electron in a ll with the number @xmath17 equal to the angular momentum @xmath10 of the parent state , @xmath18 .",
    "therefore , ( i ) families of @xmath0 states that start with @xmath19 are dark in pl and ( ii ) shake - ups to multiple landau levels ( ll s ) are strictly prohibited @xcite .",
    "the presence of a donor ion @xmath4 breaks the translational symmetry , lifts the degeneracy in @xmath11 , and makes many of the previously prohibited transitions allowed .",
    "let us discuss spectroscopic consequences of the remaining axial symmetry for a donor - bound state @xmath6 with angular momentum @xmath10 and wavefunction @xmath20 .",
    "the dipole matrix element for interband transition to a final electron state @xmath21 with angular momentum projection @xmath22 is @xmath23 conservation of angular momentum @xmath24 can be satisfied for a number of final states @xmath21 belonging to different ll s .",
    "therefore , shake - up processes become allowed in pl .",
    "more than that , pl of @xmath6 states with @xmath25 must proceed via shake - ups to higher ll s @xcite .",
    "this is because electron states with angular momenta @xmath26 are only available in @xmath27 or higher ll s .",
    "note that the shake - up processes are due to the coulomb induced admixture of ll s and are suppressed in strong fields as @xmath28 .",
    "we obtain the energies and wavefunctions of the @xmath6 complexes and of free @xmath0 excitons by diagonalization of the interaction hamiltonian using a complete basis of states compatible with both axial and electron permutational symmetries .",
    "the basis states are constructed out of the in - plane wavefunctions in ll s and size quantization levels in a qw with proper symmetrization for triplet and singlet states .",
    "we consider up to @xmath29 basis states and , by applying an adaptive scheme , we choose out of these about @xmath30 states to be diagonalized in the hamiltonian matrix .",
    "a stability for the donor - bound charged exciton is determined with respect to its dissociation to a neutral donor and a free exciton , @xmath31 .",
    "accordingly , a binding energy of a stable @xmath6 complex is defined as the energy difference between the total coulomb energies @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 being in their ground states . binding energy ( [ dxb ] ) determines the energy difference between the positions of a neutral exciton and a donor - bound charged exciton pl emission lines , @xmath35 .",
    "the calculated binding energies of the various charged exciton states in a 100   gaas qw as functions of the distance @xmath1 to the donor ion @xmath4 are shown in fig .  1",
    ". we estimate the accuracy in binding energies to be of the order of @xmath36  mev .",
    "the limiting case @xmath37 corresponds to free charged excitons @xmath0 .",
    "there are three documented bound states in this limit : the bright singlet @xmath38 with @xmath39 , the dark triplet @xmath40 with @xmath41 , and the bright triplet @xmath42 with @xmath39 ( see and references therein ) .",
    "we found two new bound states : the second dark triplet state with @xmath41 , labeled @xmath43 in fig .  1 , and the second bright singlet state with @xmath39 , labeled @xmath44 .",
    "these states are very weakly bound and will be discussed in more detail elsewhere .",
    "our results show that the parent bright singlet state @xmath38 with @xmath39 remains always bound .",
    "its binding energy initially decreases with decreasing @xmath1 , reaches its minimum when the donor @xmath4 is very close to the heteroboundary , and then increases again .",
    "we interpret this as an indication toward a rearrangement of the type of binding in the singlet @xmath45 state : at very large distances @xmath1 , the donor ion binds @xmath2 as a whole , barely affecting its internal structure . in the opposite limit of an in - well donor ,",
    "the interaction of electrons with the @xmath4 is stronger than that with the hole .",
    "the donor - bound complex formed in this case is better described as an exciton bound to a neutral donor @xmath7 .",
    "notice a systematic change in the dipole transition matrix elements @xmath46 in fig .  1",
    ": as the binding energy of a complex decreases , its spatial extent increases leading to the increase in @xmath46 .",
    "this is consistent with the notion of `` giant oscillator strengths '' @xcite .",
    "we found just one state that only exists in the presence of the @xmath4 and does not have its free @xmath37 counterpart : the dark singlet state @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "it only becomes bound when the @xmath4 is located in a qw or very near to it .",
    "this is also the only donor - bound state that remains bound in the strictly 2d high - field limit in symmetric electron - hole systems @xcite . according to ( [ dipole ] )",
    ", the pl from this state goes mostly via shake - ups to @xmath49 electron ll . as a result ,",
    "the dipole transition matrix elements @xmath46 shown in fig .",
    "1 are very small .",
    "in contrast to singlet states , the dark @xmath40 and bright @xmath42 triplet states survive only for sufficiently large distances @xmath1 to the donor ion @xmath4 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this is because electrons in triplet states can not simultaneously occupy the @xmath50-state in the lowest ll and , therefore , it is difficult to find a configuration with optimized electron - donor interactions .",
    "notice the finite oscillator strengths for the pl from the donor - bound complex @xmath51 originating from the dark triplet state .",
    "we stress that each free @xmath0 state gives rise to a family of degenerate states ; only the evolution of the parent @xmath0 states is shown in fig .  1 . the degeneracy in the in - plane position of the guiding center ( quantum number @xmath11 ) is lifted in the presence of the donor ion @xmath4 .",
    "figure  2 demonstrates this for the family of singlet bright states @xmath38 .",
    "when the distance to the donor @xmath1 decreases , all but one state ( with @xmath39 ) become one by one unbound .",
    "this leads to a number of optically active states with large oscillator strengths .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have shown there is a multitude of donor - bound @xmath0 states that may exhibit relatively weak dependencies of binding energies and oscillator strengths on positions of remote donors .",
    "our results may be relevant for explanation of the pl from the dark triplet state @xmath52 , of the multiple pl peaks observed in different experiments , and of the @xmath0 shake - ups in pl ."
