    "the size distribution of the stellar bodies of galaxies , and its evolution with cosmic time , provides important clues about the assembly history of galaxies and the relationship with their dark matter halos .",
    "the two main classes of galaxies , early and late types , show very different dependencies between size and stellar mass @xcite .",
    "the weak dependence between size and mass for late - type galaxies implies that the high - mass late types , on average , have higher surface mass densities than low - mass late types .",
    "in contrast , early types show a more complex relationship between stellar mass and density , with the density peaking for systems with stellar masses around @xmath13 and decreasing toward both lower and higher masses , as reflected in the classical @xcite relation . this fundamental difference does not depend on whether classification of early and late types is based on star formation activity , bulge dominance ( srsic index ) , or visual inspection , and it implies that the two types have very different evolutionary and assembly histories .",
    "in this paper we present the evolution of the size - mass distribution up to @xmath11 on the basis of spectroscopy and multiwavelength photometry from the 3d - hst survey @xcite and _ hst_/wfc3 imaging from candels @xcite .",
    "angular galaxy sizes are measured from the candels imaging as described by @xcite and the _ hst_/wfc3 grism observations from 3d - hst provide spectroscopic confirmation and redshifts for a large fraction of the sample , considerably strengthening  with respect to previous studies  the fidelity of estimates for stellar masses and rest - frame photometric properties .",
    "so far , most of the previous studies have focused on the evolution of average galaxy sizes of the high - mass end of the distribution ( @xmath14 ) . enabled by both the improved data quality and a fivefold increase in sample size , we can now , for the first time , describe the size distribution of galaxies across redshift .      tracing the evolution of the size distribution with redshift allows us to test the most basic elements in our theory of galaxy formation .",
    "the zeroth - order expectation is that disk scale lengths evolve fast , approximately as the inverse of the hubble parameter @xcite , and early and recent work on the average sizes of lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) at high redshifts ( @xmath15 ) roughly agree with this expectation for a @xmath16cdm cosmology : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite all find rapid size evolution with redshift : @xmath17 .",
    "in contrast , the average size at a given stellar mass of the population of disk - dominated galaxies evolves slowly at late times ( @xmath18 ) and has been reported to evolve slowly as measured at fixed galaxy mass ( @xmath19 ) or not at all @xcite .",
    "the implication would be that the evolution of the disk galaxy population is decoupled from the evolution of the dark matter halo population .",
    "one fundamental difference between the results of lbgs and lower - redshift disk galaxies is the rest - frame wavelength at which the sizes are measured : the rest - frame uv light seen for lbgs originates from young stars that may be , and are generally expected to be , distributed differently than bulk of the baryonic and stellar mass , not to mention the consequences of extinction .",
    "the advent of ground - based near - infrared imaging surveys helped to bridge the @xmath20 and @xmath21 regimes by enabling size measurements in a consistent manner at a fixed rest - frame wavelength .",
    "early results suggested slow evolution for late - type galaxies up to @xmath22 @xcite , but the uncertainties at @xmath23 were such that evolution in that regime was not strongly constrained .",
    "later ground - based work pointed at faster evolution at a fixed galaxy mass : @xcite found @xmath24 and @xcite found @xmath25 , but precise constraints at @xmath26 remained elusive and the apparent tension between the @xmath18 work and the near - infrared at @xmath27 unaddressed .",
    "several _ hst_/nicmos - based studies of the morphology and structure of massive @xmath28 galaxies in the rest - frame optical eventually led to mostly converged results , with @xmath29 for massive ( @xmath9 ) , star - forming galaxies from @xmath30 to the present @xcite .",
    "so far it has remained unclear as to whether the difference with the significantly faster evolution for lbg galaxies ( @xmath31 ) is caused by morphological @xmath32 corrections , the difference in mass ( the typical lbg has @xmath33 ) , or physical changes with redshift . in addition , the difference with the previously mentioned studies at @xmath20 @xcite remains unexplained .",
    "improving the measurement of @xmath34 and its mass dependence is crucial in order take the next step toward understanding disk galaxy formation . in this paper",
    "we will address these issues and describe the full size - mass distribution of high - redshift galaxies over a broad range in galaxy mass and redshift .",
    "we will    * measure the evolution of the slope of the size - mass relation ; * present the size distribution as a function of stellar mass and redshift ; * provide a consistent comparison with uv - selected , high - redshift samples .      over the past five years ,",
    "more attention has been bestowed on the size evolution of early - type galaxies than on the size evolution of late - type , star - forming galaxies .",
    "interest in the topic was initiated by reports that @xmath27 early - type galaxies have remarkably small sizes in _ hst_-based rest - frame uv imaging @xcite and ground - based near - infrared imaging @xcite .",
    "nicmos imaging presented by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite provided space - based , rest - frame optical size measurements that strengthened the evidence for rapid size evolution ( @xmath35 or faster ) as measured at a fixed galaxy mass ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "this notion became firmly established through larger samples @xcite and the first spectroscopic samples @xcite .",
    "concerns regarding gross overestimates of the stellar mass content of the compact early - type galaxies were alleviated by dynamical mass estimates of such galaxies at @xmath37 @xcite , and the analysis by @xcite of ultra - deep imaging of a single compact galaxy has demonstrated the absence of low - surface brightness wings that could have been missed by shallower imaging .",
    "increases in sample size and dynamic range in stellar mass have constrained the average size evolution of early - type galaxies with stellar masses @xmath38 to @xmath39 up to @xmath40 , with no evidence for a change in the slope of the relation over this mass range @xcite .",
    "the steepness of the relation combined with the non - negligible scatter accommodates observations that early - type galaxies display a large range in size at @xmath23 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the observational results have largely converged , the interpretation is still debated .",
    "some authors have considered the average increase in size over time as being due to the addition of new , larger early - type galaxies . while some argue that this can not reproduce the observations @xcite",
    ", others argue that a population of compact early - type galaxies ( with sizes @xmath41kpc ) exists within present - day clusters , with a number density comparable to that of higher - redshift early - type galaxies @xcite ; tension with the absence of such galaxies in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) remains @xcite . the crucial observational test is to trace the evolution of the number density of early - type galaxies as a function of their size .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and @xcite show strong evolution in the number density of small galaxies at @xmath42 , while @xcite claim no evolution at @xmath43 .",
    "our use of 5 fields addresses the issue of field - to - field variations that may affect the aforementioned studies based on smaller samples , and it extends the dynamic redshift range of the carollo et al .  sample .",
    "the leading explanation for the size growth of individual galaxies is accretion and tidal disruption of satellite galaxies that gradually build up the outer parts . for this process",
    ", the change in size is large compared with the increase in mass : @xmath44 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this analytical prediction based on conservation of binding energy has been tested through numerical simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". the analytically predicted and simulated evolution in the increased surface mass density at large radii is , in fact , observed @xcite ; in addition , the central stellar density shows little evolution @xcite , which is also consistent with a minor merger scenario . in other words ,",
    "the observations show that there is no need , and little room , to physically expand a galaxy by displacing large numbers of stars to large radii through rapid changes in the central potential , as suggested by @xcite . a possible challenge to the minor merger scenario",
    "is posed by the lack of strong evolution in the slope of the mass density profile seen in lensing galaxies @xcite .    until recently",
    ", the size evolution of late- and early - type galaxies was usually discussed separately and treated as different topics .",
    "however , in order to understand the joint evolution of these classes , one has to take into account the continuous transition of late - type to early - type galaxies seen in particular in the stellar mass range of @xmath45 to @xmath46 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the evolutionary path of the transitioning galaxies has not been fully mapped out .    in this paper , regarding the evolution of early - type galaxies , we will    * present the distribution of sizes as a function of stellar mass and redshift , jointly with those of late - type galaxies ; and * show the evolution of the number density of early - type galaxies as a function of size .    after describing the data and sample selection in section [ sec : data ] we present and analyze size distributions as a function of redshift and galaxy mass in section [ sec : distr ] .",
    "we compare our results with previous studies in section [ sec : comparison ] and then discuss the implications of our findings in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we assume the cosmological parameters @xmath47 .",
    "finally , we use ab magnitudes and the @xcite stellar initial mass function .",
    "the procedures for source detection , multiwavelength photometry , redshift determinations , rest - frame color and stellar mass estimates are described elsewhere . here , we briefly summarize these steps .",
    "the 207,967 sources in all five candels/3d - hst fields @xcite are detected in and extracted from images that combine the available _",
    "hst_/wfc3 ir channel data ; that is , stacked mosaics consisting of f125w , f140w , and f160w imaging are constructed for this purpose .",
    "we refer to the photometry data release paper from the 3d - hst collaboration by @xcite for details .",
    "multiwavelength photometry from _ hst_/wfc3 and _ hst_/acs imaging is produced by creating point spread function ( psf)-matched images , using custom - made kernels and performing simple aperture photometry .",
    "multiwavelength photometry from ground - based optical - nir and _",
    "spitzer_/irac imaging is produced using the approach outlined by @xcite and further developed by @xcite , which addresses blending by nearby sources and takes the large differences in psf into account through the use of custom - made convolution kernels . like alternative methods such as tfit @xcite ,",
    "our approach uses high - resolution images as priors to model sources in lower - resolution images .",
    "photometric redshifts are determined on the basis of the multiwavelength photometry using the eazy  package @xcite . @xcite",
    "describe the procedure in full , but it essentially follows @xcite : briefly , linear combinations of a set of templates that span the range of observed galaxy properties are used to fit the photometry , producing a marginalized posterior probability distribution for the redshift , with @xmath48 as its peak .",
    "the photometric redshifts provide a baseline for 3d - hst wfc3 g141 grism spectroscopy to provide more precise redshift information .",
    "@xcite describe the extraction of spectra and redshift determination in detail .",
    "the method has been updated to use interlaced rather than drizzled _",
    "hst_/wfc3 mosaics , which are used to construct the photometric catalogs . for all sources brighter than @xmath49",
    ", the f140w image is traced along the dispersed wfc3/g141 grism image , such that a spectrum is extracted that accounts for the convolved spectral and spatial information of the low wavelength resolution ( @xmath50 ) grism data . for each extracted object",
    "the spectroscopic information is combined with the photometric redshift probability distribution , producing a new best - fitting redshift ( i.g .",
    "momcheva et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "finally , spectroscopic redshifts from the literature are used when available .",
    "the grism data significantly improve the redshift precision for thousands of galaxies and provide indispensable evidence for the good accuracy of the purely photometric redshift estimates .",
    "the current version of the 3d - hst redshift catalog contains grism redshift information for all objects brighter than @xmath51 and for which such data is available ( @xmath5275% of the candels area ) . for our mass - limited sample  defined below in section [ sec : sample ]  this amounts to @xmath5210,000 galaxies .",
    "this is @xmath5230% of the total sample and 50% for the sample of massive ( @xmath53 ) galaxies in the crucial redshift range @xmath54 . for these galaxies",
    "the @xcite pair test demonstrates a precision of @xmath55 , or 0.3% . for purely photometric redshifts",
    "this is @xmath56 , depending on the varying photometric data set available for each of the five fields , suggesting a factor of @xmath57 improvement in redshift precision from the grism data .",
    "there is no systematic offset between the two sets of redshifts .",
    "eazy  is used to compute the rest - frame @xmath58 and @xmath59 colors , and the package fast  @xcite is used to estimate stellar masses .",
    "a large number of @xcite templates with solar metallicity , a wide range in age ( @xmath60  yr to @xmath61  yr , but always younger than the universe ) , exponentially declining star - formation histories ( with time scales @xmath62  yr ) , and dust extinction ( @xmath63 ) are used and matched to the photometry .",
    "the final stellar mass is corrected for the difference between the total f160w flux from the photometric catalog and the total f160w as measured with galfit  ( see section [ sec : size ] ) .",
    "f125w is used in case f160w is not available .",
    "this correction ensures that our size and mass estimates are mutually consistent in that both are based on the same model for the light distribution",
    ".    the uncertainties in the stellar mass estimates can be large and are to some extent still unknown .",
    "however , the possible error in the mass - to - light ratio for low - mass blue galaxies with precisely known redshifts due to uncertainties in the star formation history and metallicity is not larger than a factor of a few .",
    "moreover , for high - mass galaxies the relation between dynamical and stellar mass estimates is the same to within a factor of @xmath64 over the whole redshift range @xmath65 , indicating that stellar mass estimates are reasonably consistent at different redshifts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the direct mass measurement of a @xmath27 strong gravitational lens is also in agreement with the photometrically estimated stellar mass @xcite . for these reasons we are confident that the analysis presented in this paper , which looks at galaxies that span several orders of magnitude in stellar mass , is not fundamentally dependent on the current uncertainties in the mass estimates .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , we utilize rest - frame colors to distinguish between the two basic classes of galaxies : star - forming and quiescent galaxies . in this paper",
    "we refer to the former as late - type galaxies and to the latter as early - type galaxies . in figure [ uvj ]",
    "we show the rest - frame @xmath58 and @xmath59 color distribution of galaxies with stellar mass in excess of @xmath45 for a range of redshifts .",
    "even beyond @xmath66 the early- and late - type galaxies are separated in this space , which allows us to effectively assign each object to one of the two classes .",
    "an indication of the high fidelity of this selection method is that less than 20% of the thus classified early - type galaxies with matches in the fireworks catalog from @xcite are detected at @xmath67 m , while more than @xmath68 of the late - type galaxies are detected  these numbers are for the mass range @xmath69 and the redshift range @xmath70 .",
    "we note that a simpler selection by just @xmath58 color would compromise the separation into types , as the subsample of galaxies that are red in @xmath58 consist of dusty and quiescent objects .",
    "in addition , 80% of the color - selected early - type ( late - type ) galaxies have srsic indices large ( smaller ) than @xmath71 .",
    "we adopt redshift- and color - dependent mass limits ( figure [ mmag ] ) that are set by the f160w magnitude limit down to which galaxy sizes  here described in section [ sec : size ]  can be determined with high fidelity .",
    "@xcite showed that galaxy sizes can be precisely and accurately determined down to a magnitude limit of @xmath72 ; at fainter magnitudes the random and systematic errors can exceed 20% for large galaxies with large srsic indices .",
    "since most @xmath23 galaxies in our sample have small sizes ( 0.3  in the median ) and low srsic indices ( 1.4 in the median ) this magnitude limit is conservative .    out to @xmath11 our magnitude - limited sample is complete in stellar mass down to @xmath73 ( see figure [ mmag ] ) .",
    "this limit is 1.9 magnitudes brighter than the @xmath74  detection limit , and simulations of artificial objects inserted in the images show that @xmath75  of all objects are detected @xcite .",
    "therefore , incompleteness will not be an issue for our sample , and biases against large ( or small ) galaxies will not play a significant role .",
    "our mass - selected sample , with a redshift - dependent mass limit as described above ( and a minimum of @xmath76 and @xmath77 at all redshifts ) , contains 32,722 galaxies .",
    "43 of these are excluded because of catastrophically failed surface brightness profile fits .",
    "we then manually verified the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , size measurements , mass and redshift estimates of all 7065 objects with flagged galfit  results ( @xmath78 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , small or large sizes ( @xmath79  kpc ; @xmath80  kpc ) , large stellar masses ( @xmath81 ) , or large differences between photometric and grism redshifts ( @xmath82 ) , as well as all early - type galaxies at redshifts @xmath83 .",
    "we removed 1721 ( 5.3% ) after this verification because of errors in the size , redshift , or mass measurements .",
    "hence , we have a final sample of 30,958 galaxies ; 21,828 ( 5189 ) are at @xmath23 ( @xmath21 ) .    in figure [ muv ]",
    "we show the rest - frame @xmath84-@xmath85 distribution and a clear bimodality is seen , equivalent to the bimodality seen in figure [ uvj ] . as is well - known , more massive galaxies are redder and more likely to be quiescent , at least up to @xmath30 .",
    "the most massive galaxies @xmath86 are essentially all red .",
    "they are a mix of quiescent and star - forming galaxies ; the quiescent galaxies dominate in number at @xmath20 and the star - forming galaxies dominate at @xmath21 .",
    "galaxy sizes are measured as described by @xcite , from mosaics created by the 3d - hst collaboration from public candels f125w and f160w and 3d - hst f140w raw imaging data . with galfit",
    "we fit single - component srsic profiles to the two - dimensional light profiles of all detected objects , making use of custom - made psf models ; the package galapagos  allows for simultaneous fitting of as many neighboring objects as needed , in order to avoid confusion . as the effective radius we use the semi - major axis of the ellipse that contains half of the total flux of the best - fitting srsic model . for a full description of the procedure",
    ", we refer to @xcite ; the size measurements published in their catalog and the size measurements here are fully consistent .",
    "color gradients and their evolution affect the size measurements to a degree that greatly exceeds the statistical uncertainties in our sample averages and the size distributions as a function of galaxy mass and redshift .",
    "the dynamic range in wavelength for our sample is rather small ( from @xmath87 m to @xmath88 m ) , which does not allow us to systematically probe the effect of color gradients over the large range in redshift . to extend the dynamic range , we analyze acs / f814w imaging in the cosmos field from candels parallel observations .",
    "galapagos is used to obtain galaxy sizes in precisely the same manner for the f814w data as for the wfc3 data .    using this extension in wavelength ,",
    "we show in figure [ mgrad ] the wavelength dependence of galaxy size for a sample of 777 late - type galaxies .",
    "the figure shows @xmath89 as a function of galaxy mass and redshift . for galaxies at @xmath20 , the difference between @xmath90 from the f814w and f125w size measurements",
    "was taken as @xmath91 ; for @xmath23 galaxies the difference between @xmath90 from the f125w and f160w measurements was taken .",
    "the pivot wavelengths of the respective filters are used to compute @xmath92 .",
    "the generally negative values of the quantity @xmath93 imply that late - type galaxies are typically smaller at longer wavelengths and thus have negative color gradients ( redder centers ) .",
    "the color gradients of @xmath23 galaxies have been extensively studied before ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and here we merely mention the trends that are relevant for our conversion of the measured @xmath94 to the @xmath94 at a rest - frame wavelength of 5000@xmath95 .",
    "color gradients are strongest for the most massive galaxies at all redshifts and stronger at later cosmic times for galaxies of all masses .",
    "the evolution is remarkably smooth , which allows us to parameterize the wavelength dependence of @xmath94 as a simple function of redshift and galaxy stellar mass :    @xmath96    @xcite derive a very similar wavelength dependence of @xmath94 , but a direct comparison can not be made as those authors do not distinguish between galaxies with different masses .",
    "then , @xmath94 at a rest - frame wavelength of 5000@xmath95 is estimated as    @xmath97    where f denotes either f125w ( for galaxies at @xmath98 ) or f160w ( for galaxies at @xmath26 ) , and @xmath99 is the ` pivot redshift ' for these respective filters ( 1.5 for f125w and 2.2 for f160w ) .",
    "positive color gradients as computed with equation ( 1 ) are set at zero .",
    "a similarly detailed correction for early - type galaxies is currently not feasible as that subsample is much smaller and has much redder colors . for the 122 early - type galaxies in the cosmos field at redshifts @xmath65 and with robust size measurements in all three filters",
    ", we find an average size gradient of @xmath100 , with no discernible trends with mass and redshift , which is in reasonable agreement with @xcite for low - redshift early - type galaxies and @xcite for high - redshift early - type galaxies .",
    "hence , we adopt this value for all early - type galaxies when computing their rest - frame @xmath101 sizes with equation 2 .",
    "this rather convoluted procedure has a small but significant effect on the size measurements , with implications for the rate of size evolution . in the redshift range @xmath70 , the size corrections are always smaller than 0.05 dex",
    "because the observed wavelength is always close to the desired rest - frame wavelength ; at @xmath20 the correction can increase up to 0.15 dex , but there the color gradient is well constrained ( see figure [ mgrad ] ) for all galaxy masses .",
    "the size - mass distributions for early- and late - type galaxies as a function of redshift are shown in figure [ mr ] .",
    "the first basic observation is that a well - defined size - mass relation exists at all redshifts @xmath1 for both populations . with increasing redshift , the two classes have increasingly different size - mass relations , mostly as a result of strongly decreasing @xmath94 for early types .",
    "in addition , at all redshifts the slope of the relation is steeper for early types than for late types . at all stellar masses",
    "@xmath103 early - type galaxies are , on average , smaller than late - type galaxies , but at very high stellar masses ( @xmath104 ) the two populations have similar sizes at all redshifts , as far as the small samples allow for such a comparison .    however , the relation for early - type galaxies flattens out below @xmath105 , at least up to @xmath106 , beyond which our sample is incomplete at these low masses .",
    "this implies that the peak in surface mass density at @xmath107 seen in the present - day universe also existed at larger look - back times , at least up to @xmath28 .",
    "in section [ sec : fitsize ] we will first provide an analytical description of the size - mass relation , which allows us to take cross - contamination between the two types and outliers into account .",
    "in the remainder of this section we will provide various direct measurements such as median sizes and percentile distributions as a function of mass and redshift and describe trends that are not captured by our analytical description , such as deviations from a single power law and skewness of the size distribution .",
    "the basic characteristics of the galaxy size distribution are given by the slope , intercept , and ( intrinsic ) scatter of size as a function of mass .",
    "we parameterize this following @xcite and assume a log - normal distribution @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the mean and @xmath110 is the dispersion .",
    "furthermore , @xmath111 is taken to be a function of galaxy mass :        the model distribution @xmath114 prescribes the probability distribution for observing @xmath94 for a galaxy with mass @xmath115 .",
    "if the measured @xmath94 has a gaussian , 1-@xmath116 uncertainty of @xmath117 , then the probability for this observation is the inner product of two gaussians : @xmath118 thus , we compute for each galaxy the probabilities @xmath119 and @xmath120 for the respective size - mass distribution models for the early - type and late - type populations .",
    "incompleteness terms should formally be included in these probabilities ( as described by , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but because of our conservative sample selection ( see section [ sec : sample ] ) we are not biased against faint , large objects .",
    "the uncertainty in size , @xmath117 , is computed as outlined by @xcite . a random uncertainty of 0.15 dex in @xmath115 is included in our analysis by treating it as an additional source of uncertainty in @xmath94 : for a size - mass relation with a given slope , an offset in @xmath115 translates into an offset in @xmath94 .",
    "hence , the calculation of @xmath121 stays one - dimensional .",
    "the fiducial slopes we use to convert @xmath117 into @xmath122 are @xmath123 for early - type galaxies and @xmath124 for late - type galaxies .",
    "we also take into account the misclassification of early- and late - type galaxies . despite the bimodal distribution in the color - color diagram ( section [ sec : sample ] ; figure [ uvj ] ) , there are galaxies in the region between the star - forming and quiescent sequences , making their classification rather arbitrary and causing cross - contamination of the two classes ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "motivated by this work , we take this misclassification probability to be 10% .",
    "we will comment on the effects of varying this parameter below , when we describe the fitting results .",
    "the misclassification probability precisely corresponds to the early- and late - type contamination fractions in a sample in cases where the two sub - samples have an equal number of galaxies .",
    "the actual contamination fraction scales with the early- , and late - type fractions , which depend on galaxy mass and redshift .",
    "the evolution of the stellar mass function for the two types is described by @xcite , which we use here to compute this ratio .",
    "we also allow for 1% of outliers : these are objects that are not part of the galaxy population , for example , catastrophic redshift estimates or misclassified stars .",
    "finally , in order to avoid being dominated by the large number of low - mass galaxies , we also assign a weight to each galaxy thatq is inversely proportional to the number density .",
    "this ensures that each mass range carries equal weight in the fit .",
    "the number density is taken from the @xcite mass functions .",
    "then , we compute the total likelihood for a set of six model parameters ( intercept @xmath125 , slope @xmath126 , and intrinsic scatter @xmath127 , each for both types of galaxies ) : @xmath128\\ ] ] for early - type galaxies , and @xmath129\\ ] ] for late - type galaxies , where @xmath130 is the weight and @xmath131 is the contamination fraction , both of which are a function of redshift and mass .",
