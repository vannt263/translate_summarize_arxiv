    "the charge - parity - time ( cpt ) reversal invariance is a fundamental symmetry in the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics , so a cpt - violating signal is a smoking gun of new physics beyond sm .",
    "a number of ground - based experiments have been built in order to test this symmetry to high precision .",
    "however , no statistically significant signals have been found from these lab - scale experiments so far .    on the other hand",
    ", the cpt symmetry needs to be reexamined on cosmic scales . in the universe",
    ", the cpt symmetry can break down in the model with an effective coupling @xmath2 between a non - conserved current @xmath3 of the sm particles and a scalar field @xmath4 , which may be identified as the dark energy or the ricci scalar @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is an arbitrary function of @xmath4 . as an external field , the dynamics of @xmath4 is fixed , therefore the lorentz and cpt symmetries of the sm particles break down spontaneously .",
    "this has been used to interpret the matter - antimatter asymmetry with the current @xmath3 being the baryon or lepton currents @xcite . in these models",
    "the cpt - violating signal is large at the early stage to generate enough baryon number asymmetry but too small to be detectable by the ground based experiments at present time .",
    "another interesting phenomenon of the cosmological cpt violation arises if the @xmath3 is the chern - simons current of the electromagnetic field . in this case",
    "the polarisation directions of photons rotate when propagating in the space @xcite .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath7 , which characterises the cpt - violating signal , depends on the difference of @xmath8 between the source and the receiver of photons .",
    "it could be large as photons travel across the astronomical and cosmological distances , even though the coupling itself is very small .    the cosmic cpt violation , if exists , could in principle be detected by the observation of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) angular power spectra . because the rotation of the polarisation vector of the cmb photons can covert part of the e - mode polarisation to b - mode polarisation",
    ", the non - zero tb and eb cross correlation , which vanishes in traditional cmb theory , can be induced @xcite .",
    "the rotation angle can be probed by observations of the tb and eb power spectra @xcite , and the first constraint on the rotation angle using cmb observations was obtained in @xcite .",
    "recent studies along this line have demonstrated that current cmb experiments have the sensitivity to probe the rotation angle at the level of @xmath9@xcite .",
    "as quite a few b - mode cmb experiments are ongoing or being planned , we expect to have high quality observations of the tb and eb spectra , in addition to the tt , ee and te spectra in the near future .",
    "therefore we need a fast and accurate method to measure the rotation angle using these spectra .",
    "traditional methods , , @xcite , which are based on the global fitting using the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method , are time consuming and computationally expensive .",
    "alternative methods , which are more efficient , exist , , @xcite , but are restricted to the special case where intrinsic bb vanishes . as the hint of a non - zero bb being discovered @xcite and investigated @xcite , an efficient , and more general method including the intrinsic bb spectra are naturally needed . in this paper , we develop such a new method to probe the rotational angle based on a linear regression algorithm .",
    "we first validate the method using the simulated cmb data , before applying to recent cmb observations .",
    "the paper is outlined as follows . in section",
    "ii , we shall present the methodology , including the tests using mock data .",
    "section iii shows the result of the measurement , followed by a discussion and conclusion section .",
    "in this section , we shall develop the methodology by first presenting the formulism , and then applying it to the simulated cmb data for a validation test .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath10 is anisotropic in general and can be decomposed into an isotropic part and an anisotropic one @xcite , namely , ( ) = |+ ( )  . the cpt symmetry is violated by the background @xmath11 , and the fluctuation @xmath12 will bring distortions to the cmb spectra , similar to the lensing effect .",
    "the technique based on the quadratic estimator to detect the anisotropies of @xmath10 has been developed in refs .",
    "if the rotation angle itself has a spectrum , the rotated spectra of cmb can be calculated analytically @xcite .    the general relation between the unrotated and rotated angular power spectra @xmath13 is @xcite , [ eq : clrot ] c_^tt , rot&=&c_^tt + c_^te , rot&=&a  c_^te  cos(2| ) + c_^tb , rot&= & a  c_^te  sin(2| ) + 2c_^eb , rot&= & a^2  f ( )  sin(4| ) + c_^ee , rot - c_^bb , rot&= & a^2  f ( )  cos(4| ) here f()_(c_^ee - c_^bb)_-1 ^ 1d_-22^ ( ) d_-22^()exp[-4c^()]dcos ( ) where @xmath14 is the wigner small-@xmath15 function and the two - point correlation function @xmath16 is defined as , c^()_c^_p_(cos ) and @xmath17 is the angular power spectrum of the rotation angle , say , ( ) = _ m a_m y_m ( ) ,  a_m",
    "a^_m c^___m m the overall constant @xmath18 is related to @xmath19 via @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "note that in the limit that the anisotropic part vanishes , , @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 and we get the familiar relation for a constant rotation angle @xcite ,    [ eq : clrotconst ] c_^tt , rot&=&c_^tt + c_^te , rot&=&c_^te  cos(2| ) + c_^tb , rot&= & c_^te  sin(2| ) + 2c_^eb , rot&= & ( c_^ee - c_^bb )  sin(4| ) + c_^ee , rot - c_^bb , rot&= & ( c_^ee - c_^bb )  cos(4| )    from eq ( [ eq : clrot ] ) , it is straightforward to eliminate the unrotated @xmath13 s and obtain the following two linear relations between the rotated @xmath13 s ,    [ eq : est_theo ] c_^tb , rot- tan(2| )  c_^te , rot&=&0 + 2c_^eb , rot- tan(4| )  ( c_^ee , rot - c_^bb , rot)&=&0note that these relations generally hold , even if the anisotropy part of the rotation angle exists ( since it drops out ) , and they are cosmology - independent simply because the theoretical , unrotated @xmath13 s do not show up here .",
    "this , in principle , allows the estimation of @xmath11 directly from data . in",
    "what follows , we shall develop a new method based on the linear regression to estimate @xmath11 , validate it using simulated data and apply it to the real cmb observations .",
    "the observed angular power spectra , @xmath23 , are the rotated ones with measurement uncertainties .",
    "therefore , the left hand side of eq ( [ eq : est_theo ] ) do not strictly vanish when @xmath24 is replaced by @xmath23 , but with residues @xmath25 and @xmath26 , namely , _ & & c_^tb , obs- tan(2| )  c_^te , obs + _ & & 2c_^eb , obs- tan(4| )  ( c_^ee , obs - c_^bb , obs )    it is a typical linear regression problem to find @xmath11 from the above relation , and similar problems have been studied extensively in other fields of astronomy @xcite . here",
    "we briefly review these methods .    for a linear regression problem , namely , y_i = x_i , where the @xmath27 pair denotes the @xmath28th measurement with errors and the slope @xmath29 is the free parameter to be determined .",
    "the developed linear regression methods include @xmath30 ( ordinary least squares ) , @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 @xcite , @xmath33 ( maximum likelihood estimates ) @xcite and the sophisticated full bayesian gaussian mixing method @xcite .",
    "@xcite extensively compared the behaviour of all these methods based on the simulated data obeying various distributions , and concluded that the @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and the bayesian methods work equally well .",
    "here we adopt the @xmath32 model due to its robustness and simplicity .",
    "the fitexy method was originally proposed in @xcite and modified by @xcite .",
    "this method determines @xmath29 by minimising the following @xmath34 ( we ignore the correlations among data points for the moment ) , [ eq : chi2 ] ^2=_i=1^n here @xmath35 accounts for the intrinsic scatter in the measurement of @xmath36 , and its value is to be determined by iteration such that the reduced @xmath34 for the best fit model equals one , , @xmath37 .",
    "this is to guarantee that the dataset is never under - fitted in order to avoid the bias . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath30 method ( , when the intrinsic scatter is not included ) can lead to severely biased result .    in general cases where the measurements are correlated , , ( x_i , x_j)0 ;   cov(y_i , y_j)0 ;  cov(x_i , y_j)0 , we generalise eq ( [ eq : chi2 ] ) to , ^2= (  ) (    cc*f _ * & * f _ * + * f _ * & * f _ *    ) (    c +    ) .where =(    cc*c _ * & * c _ * + * c _ * & * c _ *    ) and [ eq : c ] ( * c_*)_ & & cov ( _ , _  ) , + ( * c_*)_ & & cov ( _ , _  ) , + ( * c_*)_ & & cov ( _ , _  ) , + ( * c_*)_ & & cov(_,_ ) .",
    "note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 are not symmetric simply because @xmath40 but @xmath41 is symmetric .",
    "these covariance matrices can be directly calculated given the full data covariance matrices , namely ,    ( _ ,  _",

    ", we generate mock cmb data following @xcite and assume a planck sensitivity summarised in table 1 therein .",

    "one can easily identify the slope in this plot visually , which is useful for a quick consistency check .",
    "for example , if the slope in the tb - te data has the opposite sign in the ee - bb - eb plot , it might suggest an inconsistency in the dataset itself .",
    "we then apply the fitexy method to measure the slope between tb and te , and between 2eb and ( ee - bb ) ( we further drop the symbol of @xmath13 for brevity ) . the measurements ( best - fit value and 68% cl uncertainty )",
    "are over - plotted with data points in fig [ fig : mock ] . given the measurement of the slope",

    "constraining the rotation angle of the polarisation vector of the cmb photons is an effective way to test the cpt symmetry on cosmological scales . given that the cmb polarisation measurements are getting more and more accurate , and that several b - mode experiments are ongoing or being planned , it is timely to develop accurate , and efficient methods to probe the rotation angle .    in this paper , we have developed a new method for this purpose based on the linear regression algorithm .",
    "compared to previously established methods , our new method is computationally efficient ( it takes several minutes on a laptop ) , accurate , intuitively transparent , and more generally applicable .",
    "this new method has successfully passed the validation tests using mock cmb data before applied to cmb observations , including actpol , b03 , bicep1 , quad , as well as bicep2 and bk .",
    "we find that the b03 and bicep1 samples prefer a nonzero rotation angle even when the systematics are included , and a combination of these two surveys gives @xmath1 , which is a @xmath0 signal . however , actpol and quad support a zero rotation angle .",
    "bicep2 and bk provide the most stringent constraint on the rotation angle , namely , the uncertainty reaches @xmath53 level , but unfortunately they can not be used to probe for the rotation angle since the datasets have been self - calibrated .    with the high - quality polarisation data available in the near future , we would be able to constrain the anisotropic rotation angle @xmath54 , as attempted by @xcite . since @xmath54 is degenerate with @xmath11 using traditional methods , our method is efficient to break the degeneracy since @xmath11 is not degenerate with any other cosmological parameters , including @xmath54 , in our prescription .",
    "an extension of this work is to develop a new algorithm to probe the anisotropic rotation angle using the regression method and a principle component analysis , which is left for a future study .",
