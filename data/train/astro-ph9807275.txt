    "it has long been realized that there are differences between populations of galaxies inside and outside of clusters ( e.g. hubble & humason 1931 ) .",
    "quantitative analyses ( oemler 1974 ; dressler 1980 ) have shown that the fractions of elliptical and s0 galaxies rise in the cores of clusters compared to their peripheries , and several studies have demonstrated that this environmental dependence extends to less dense environments ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .    these classical investigations of the dependence of morphology on environment have some weaknesses .",
    "firstly , these studies have often been based on small samples ( on the order of 10@xmath1 galaxies ) . with samples of this size ,",
    "it is difficult to make a statistically sound comparison , particularly after binning galaxies by different environments .",
    "moreover , these samples are often composed of multiple data sets with heterogeneous characteristics , such as different hubble classifications by different observers , varying image quality , and even different selection criteria of sample objects , all of which can cause spurious results if much care is not taken for their inhomogeneities",
    ". however , the most serious consequence of small samples is their inability to discriminate between effects dependent on the very local environment , as characterized , for example , by local galaxy density , from the effects of larger - scale environments , such as membership in a cluster .",
    "the significance of the distinction between local and broader environments has been a matter of much contention in cluster studies ( see , for example , dressler 1980 vs. whitmore & gilmore 1991 ) .",
    "moreover , almost all previous studies of the morphology - environment relation have used hubble type as a measure of galaxy properties .",
    "this was both natural- hubble type is easy to determine- and effective .",
    "however hubble type is a compound of two galaxy characteristics : star formation rate and bulge - to - disk ratio ( b / d ) .",
    "although the success of the hubble system demonstrates that these two parameters are well - correlated along the hubble sequence , it can not be taken for granted that the unknown processes by which environment effects morphology would act equally on these two very different characteristics .",
    "that star formation is not perfectly correlated with b / d was pointed out some time ago by van den bergh ( 1976 ) , who introduced the term `` anemic '' to refer to galaxies whose star formation rate is lower than typical for galaxies of their hubble types . in recent years",
    "many studies have sought , and some have found , evidence that star formation rates in galaxies of a given hubble type differ in different environments ( e.g. gisler 1978 ; kennicutt 1983 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "1984 ; gavazzi & jaffe 1985 ; moss & whittle 1993 ) . in a previous paper ( hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter paper i ) , we examined this question using a sample of 15749 galaxies drawn from the las campanas redshift survey ( shectman et al .",
    "1996 ) , and found that the star formation rate in galaxies of a given bulge - to - disk ratio varies significantly with environment , in a complex manner .",
    "clearly , then , the morphology - environment relation is a compound effect , the product of a variation with environment of the dependence of star formation rate on b / d , and a ( possible ) variation with environment in the mix of galactic bulge - to - disk ratios .",
    "having established the former in paper i , we turn in this paper to the latter effect . in this paper",
    ", we report the results of the evaluation of the `` concentration  density '' relation for galaxies in the local universe , derived from the very large and homogeneous data set in the las campanas redshift survey .",
    "automatically measured concentration index ( okamura , kodaira , & watanabe 1984 ) , which is more closely related to the b / d than hubble type , was used to quantify the light distribution of galaxies .",
    "the concentration index not only suits our need for relatively `` star formation free '' measure of galactic structure , it is also more robust against image degradation , and easier to measure automatically .",
    "it is , thus , ideal for a large galaxy survey such as the lcrs , where the sample size is @xmath2 10@xmath3 and most of the galaxies consist of on the order of 10@xmath4 resolution elements .",
    "the las campanas redshift survey consists of galaxies inhabiting the entire range of galactic environments , from the sparsest field to the densest clusters , thus allowing us to study environmental variations without combing multiple data sets with inhomogeneous characteristics .",
    "furthermore , we can also extend our research to a `` general '' environmental investigation by , for the first time , decoupling the local galaxy density from the membership in associations .",
    "here we briefly describe our survey parameters ; the reader is referred to shectman et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for further details .",
    "the lcrs consists of 26418 galaxies , with a mean redshift @xmath5 , and a depth of about @xmath6 .",
    "the survey galaxies were selected , using isophotal and central magnitude criteria , from a ccd - based catalog obtained in a `` hybrid '' kron - cousin @xmath7 band .",
    "the survey covers over 700 square degrees in six @xmath8 `` slices '' .",
    "the first 20% of the redshifts were obtained using a 50-object fiber - optic spectrograph .",
    "the nominal isophotal magnitude limits were @xmath9 , and an additional central magnitude limit excluded the lowest 20% of galaxies by central surface brightness .",
    "the rest of the redshifts were obtained with a 112-object fiber system , with isophotal limits of @xmath1017.7 , and exclusion of the lowest 5 - 10% of galaxies by central surface brightness .",
    "ccd images were taken at the 1 m swope telescope at las campanas using the drift scan technique through a thuan - gunn @xmath11 filter .",
    "the exposure time depends on the size of the ccd chip and the cosine of the declination , but is typically near 1 minute .",
    "three ccds were used over the course of this survey .",
    "the first was a thinned 800 @xmath12 800 ti chip , which was used with a focal reducer to obtain 105 pixels .",
    "this was replaced in march 1990 with a thick 2k @xmath12 2k loral chip , without a focal reducer and binned 2 @xmath12 2 to produce 0865 pixels .",
    "the third ccd , introduced in 1992 , is a thick 2k @xmath12 2k tektronix chip used unbinned without a reimaging optics to provide 0692 pixels .",
    "morgan ( 1958 ) first proposed a classification of galaxies based on the central light concentration , while bothun ( 1982 ) recommended the use of visual bulge - to - disk ratio as a more fundamental basis of galaxy comparison .",
    "these `` visual '' quantities have recently been superseded by the automatically determined concentration index @xmath0 ( okamura et al .",
    "1984 ; doi , fukugita , & okamura 1993 ; abraham et al .",
    "concentration retains a very close connection with estimates of bulge - to - disk ratios , thus it is a purer measure of one of the two physical parameters determining hubble type .",
    "it is also quite robust against image degradation and much easier to measure automatically than the bulge - to - disk ratio itself , thus ideal for morphological classification of a large galaxy survey , such as the lcrs , where the sample size is @xmath2 10@xmath3 and most of the galaxies consist of @xmath2 10@xmath4 resolution elements .",
    "the concentration index measures the intensity weighted second moment of the galaxies and compares the flux between the inner ( @xmath11 @xmath13  0.3 ) and outer ( @xmath11 @xmath13  1 ) isophote to indicate the degree of light concentration in the galaxy images . here",
    "@xmath11 is a normalized radius which is constant on an elliptical isophote and it is normalized in such a way that @xmath11 is unity when the area within the ellipse is equal to the detection area of a galaxy .",
    "( for further details of the definition , please see hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 . )",
    "another subsidiary parameter @xmath14 ( asymmetry index ) is also measured for lcrs galaxies for the purpose of excluding morphologically peculiar galaxies which are expected to introduced some scatter in the relationship between @xmath0 and b / d .",
    "@xmath14 is measured by first rotating a galaxy image by 180 degrees around the image center , then subtracting the rotated image from the original unrotated one .",
    "the residual signals above zero are summed and then normalized by flux above the sky to calculate @xmath14 .",
    "note that merged objects are deblended by the detection algorithm sextractor ( bertin 1994 , hereafter sxr ) and @xmath14 is measured for the signal inside the the outer isophote of the deblended central component . for highly blended objects where sxr can not deblend the merging components , @xmath14 is measured for the whole blended component .",
    "we characterize the environment of lcrs galaxies by calculating the local galaxy density @xmath15 around each 26418 galaxy using a nearest neighbor technique .",
    "namely , given a particular galaxy , we take the local galaxy density to be @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the three - dimensional redshift - space distance from the given galaxy to its third nearest neighbor . to account for the effect of the variation of the survey selection function at different redshifts , we replace the galaxy count by @xmath19 , so that the local galaxy density @xmath15 around a galaxy @xmath20 becomes @xmath21 where @xmath22 represents the rank of the nearest neighbors from galaxy @xmath20 . here , @xmath23 is a weight @xmath24}_{max[m_{min}(z_{i}),m_{1}]}\\phi(m)dm   \\right .",
    "\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath25 are the absolute magnitude limits in which we are interested , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the absolute magnitude limits , at the redshift of galaxy @xmath20 , corresponding to the apparent magnitude limits for the field containing galaxy @xmath20 .",
    "we describe the differential luminosity function @xmath28 by a schechter function ( schechter 1976 ) with parameters @xmath29  mpc@xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( lin et al .",
    "1996 ) , which we assume to be invariant with redshift .",
    "in addition , another weight @xmath33 is calculated for each galaxy @xmath20 to take account of the field - to - field spectroscopic sampling variations .",
    "the spectroscopic completeness of a field decreases as the projected density of galaxies in the field increases , since each spectroscopic field is observed only once , using a maximum of 50 or 112 fibers .",
    "this effect is corrected by setting @xmath34 to be the inverse of the fraction of spectroscopically observed galaxies in the field containing galaxy @xmath20 .    as the second environmental parameter , cluster or rich - group membership",
    "is determined for each galaxy in the lcrs , using the three - dimensional `` friends - of - friends '' group identification algorithm ( huchra & geller 1982 ) . the algorithm finds all pairs within a projected separation @xmath35 , and within a line of sight velocity difference @xmath36 .",
    "pairs with a member in common are linked into a single group .",
    "this linking makes the membership more sensitive to the environment on larger scales than the scale of the local density parameter .",
    "the selection parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 are scaled to account for the magnitude limit of the lcrs survey , and defined as @xmath37  and @xmath38 . here the linking scale s@xmath39 is calculated by @xmath40^{1/3}$ ] , where @xmath41 is the galaxy number density , at the mean comoving distance @xmath42 of the galaxy pair in question , for a homogeneous sample that has the same selection function as the lcrs .",
    "the distance @xmath43 is the fiducial comoving distance at redshift z@xmath44 ( we chose z@xmath44=0.1 ) at which we define @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the density enhancement contour surrounding each group is related to @xmath45 by @xmath47 - 1.$ ] the values of @xmath45 ( or @xmath48 ) and @xmath46 used are taken from the lcrs group catalog ( c.f .",
    "tucker 1994 ) , and are @xmath45= 0.72 @xmath49 mpc ( or @xmath48 = 80 ) and @xmath46 = 500 km / s , which are determined by several semi - quantitative constraints similar to those used in huchra & geller ( 1982 ) . to avoid biasing the velocity dispersions of groups .",
    "the environmental parameters are further discussed in hashimoto et .",
    "al ( 1998 ) .",
    "hubble type classification , completely independent from @xmath0 measurements , was performed visually by one of authors ( a. o. ) for @xmath2 200 lcrs galaxies .",
    "these galaxies are selected semi - randomly from three typical lcrs @xmath8 slices , so that the sample covers a wide variety of morphology and galaxy environments . for galaxies with disturbed morphologies ,",
    "a flag is assigned , as well as best estimated hubble types .",
    "an additional flag is assigned by a. o. for galaxies with uncertain or indeterminate morphologies , which are mostly galaxies with extremely small angular size ( @xmath50 55 pixels ) .",
    "1 shows the relationship between the concentration index @xmath0 and a. o. classification .",
    "galaxies with angular size less than equal to 55 pixels are excluded , as are galaxies with disturbed or uncertain morphologies .",
    "1 confirms an overall correlation between @xmath0 and hubble type , where early hubble type galaxies show higher @xmath0 values compared to late hubble type galaxies .",
    "in addition , fig .",
    "1 shows that earlier type galaxies are well separated from later type galaxies , while subtle distinctions , such as distinguishing ellipticals from s0 , are not effectively made . also note that a clearer separation can be made between sa & sc , rather than the conventional early / late type separation at a borderline between s0 & sa .",
    "2 shows the distribution of @xmath0 for cluster and field galaxies .",
    "the `` cluster '' sample consists of `` cluster or rich group '' galaxies defined in  4 .",
    "meanwhile , galaxies outside of clusters , hereafter `` field galaxies '' , are identified by removing cluster galaxies from the entire sample , except that this time , a lower @xmath48=40 ( instead of @xmath48=80 ) contour is used to ensure that galaxies in the outskirts of clusters are excluded from the field sample .",
    "the solid line represents cluster galaxies , while the dotted - dashed line represents galaxies in the field .",
    "galaxies with extremely small angular size ( @xmath50 55 pixels ) , as well as apparent disturbed galaxies ( @xmath510.09 ) are excluded . the @xmath0 distribution of the cluster galaxies is skewed toward higher b / d ( bigger @xmath0 ) .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with the morphology - density relation using the standard hubble type , however , the `` concentration - density relationship '' in fig .",
    "2 is relatively free from the systematic and random hubble type error caused by the image degradation and the star formation activities of galaxies .",
    "we can also examine the distribution of c as a function of the richness of the clusters .",
    "table 1 lists the percentiles of the various c classes in various cluster subdivisions .",
    "cluster and field definitions are the same as fig .",
    "additionally , rich and poor cluster subsets are introduced , as defined by their total luminosities @xmath52 ( tucker 1994 ) .",
    "rich clusters are defined as clusters with @xmath53 , while poor clusters are clusters with @xmath54 .",
    "three c classes are defined as , @xmath550.35 - 0.50 , 0.25 - 0.35 , and 0.10 - 0.25 .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are the total number of galaxies in each environmental class .",
    "table 1 reproduces the general trend that cluster galaxies have higher @xmath0 compared to the field galaxies .",
    "when you compare the rich and poor cluster galaxies , there is a similar but more distinctive trend that galaxies in rich clusters have higher @xmath0 with respect to galaxies in poor clusters . these two ( cluster - field and rich - poor ) comparisons seem to be consistent with each other in that galaxies in rich environments tend to have larger bulge - to - disk ratios ( higher @xmath0 ) . however , remarkable are the percentiles in the poor clusters .",
    "poor cluster galaxies seem to show _ lower _ @xmath0 with respect to the field galaxies .",
    "this might suggest that galaxies in denser regimes have smaller b / ds , which seems to contradict the implication from the previous two comparisons .",
    "note , however , that the trend is not statistically conclusive ; a @xmath56  test shows that the two proportions are significantly different at significance level @xmath57  = 7@xmath58 , 4@xmath58 , and 2@xmath58 , for @xmath55 0.35 - 0.50 , 0.25 - 0.35 , and 0.10 - 0.20 , respectively . further investigations with even larger galaxy samples are encouraged to test this possibility .",
    "2 shows the dependence of the galactic concentration on the membership in associations .",
    "we can also examine the dependence of c on the local density .",
    "3 shows the population ratio of late to early type , as a function of the local 3-space density for lcrs galaxies .",
    "bars are root n error . early and late type are determined using @xmath0 ; early type ( @xmath590.27 ) and late type ( @xmath60 0.27 ) .",
    "again , galaxies with extremely small angular size ( @xmath61 55 pixels ) , as well as apparent disturbed galaxies ( @xmath510.09 ) are excluded .",
    "3 shows that the population ratio of late to early type galaxies correlates with local galaxy density , in such a way that late type galaxies tend to be more abundant in less dense environments .",
    "fig . 2 and 3 together show that the concentration of galaxies is correlated with both the local density and membership in associations . reviewing fig . 2 & 3 ,",
    "one might be tempted to conclude that the cluster / field difference ( fig .",
    "2 ) is simply a manifestation of the variation with the local density .",
    "conversely , fig .",
    "3 might merely represent a superposition of different membership dependencies . to understand the mechanism of the environmental influence on the concentration of galaxies , it is important to further investigate the behavior of the correlation in fig . 3 inside and outside of clusters separately .",
    "4a shows the same relation as fig . 3 for the cluster sample , alone .",
    "overall , fig .",
    "4a shows a qualitatively similar correlation as fig .",
    "3 ; the late type galaxies tend to be more abundant in less dense regions .",
    "the fact that the ratio correlates with the local density inside clusters suggests that the galaxy concentration might be influenced by the environment of a relatively localized volume surrounding a galaxy , rather than the volume comparable to the size of a entire cluster . however , it is still possible that the correlation in fig .",
    "4a might be due to the local environments _ specific _ to cluster environments ( namely the local density here is not of universal nature and we do not see this local density dependence in the field ) , or the local density is universal but the cluster environments might have independent influence on the concentration of galaxies . to find out this , it is necessary to to further investigate the behavior of the correlation outside of clusters .",
    "4b shows the identical population ratio to fig .",
    "4a , but now for the _ field",
    "_  sample alone .",
    "overall , fig .",
    "4b shows qualitatively the same relation as fig .",
    "4a , namely , the concentration of galaxies is correlated with the local density even outside of the clusters .",
    "this implies that the dependence on the local density is universal and the concentration of the galaxies is perhaps predominantly influenced by the local density .",
    "the superposition of fig . 4a and 4b further reveals that the two relationships connect rather smoothly ( the inset ) , confirming that the cluster / field difference ( fig .",
    "2 ) is perhaps only a manifestation of the variation with the local density , thus we conclude that the morphology of galaxies is predominantly influenced by the local density and not by the broader environments characterized by the cluster / field memberships .",
    "the results of this study can be summarized as follows :    \\(1 ) the cluster /",
    "field subdivision shows that distributions of the concentration index of cluster galaxies is skewed toward higher bulge - to - disk ratios ( bigger @xmath0 ) .",
    "this result is qualitatively consistent with the morphology - density relation with the standard hubble type .",
    "\\(2 ) the central concentration of galaxies is also found to be correlated with the 3-space local density , in such a way that late type galaxies tend to be more abundant in the low local density environments .",
    "\\(3 ) further investigation of the behavior of the local density correlations inside and outside of clusters shows that the cluster relation and field relation connect rather smoothly at the intermediate densities , implying that the apparent cluster / field difference is perhaps only a manifestation of the variation with the local density .",
    "it thus appears that the bulge - to - disk ratios of galaxies are predominantly influenced by the local density and not by the broader environments characterized by cluster / field memberships .",
    "this result is in striking contrast to the environmental dependence of star formation rates explored in hashimoto et al .",
    "1998 ( paper i ) , which exhibit as great a sensitivity to cluster / group membership as they do to local density . in paper",
    "i , we concluded that at least _ two _ processes were at work by which environment influences star formation rates : one which suppresses star formation in rich clusters , and another which precipitates starbursts in intermediate richness environments .",
    "the differing sensitivity of @xmath0 to environment strongly suggests that structure is determined by yet a _",
    "third _ process .",
    "unfortunately , the observed dependence of concentration on environment provides little guidance about the nature of that process . presumably , galactic structure , unlike galactic star formation rates",
    ", is the product of processes operating over the entire life of the galaxy , and is not subject to short - term fluctuations .",
    "this is not inconsistent with a dependence on local density , because the local densities are correlated over very long timescales , except in the well - mixed cores of rich clusters .",
    "thus , any process sensitive to local conditions , and operating over extended periods , could produce correlations like those seen in fig .",
    "3 . local environment at the time of formation might produce fig . 3 , but so might the integrated merger rate over the life of the galaxy",
    "3 can not be used to distinguish between these alternatives , but the evolution with redshift of this relation can , and such an observation provides the best hope of elucidating the mechanisms responsible for determining galactic structure .",
