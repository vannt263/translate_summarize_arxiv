    "those experiments have brought us closer to clarification of an elusive asymptotic regime of strong interactions at fixed , low values of the momentum transferred and increasing energy of collision .",
    "this regime belongs to the soft interaction region where perturbative qcd does not work .",
    "nonperturbative qcd is still not able to provide calculations of these global observables despite that lattice qcd has successfully predicted various static characteristics of hadrons .",

    "a long time properties of analyticity and unitarity of the scattering matrix could lead to assumption that strong interactions are `` as strong as possible '' @xcite and therefore the froissart - martin bound @xcite for the total cross - sections should be saturated at asymptotical energies .",
    "then , the explicit functional energy behavior of the total cross - sections is often taken to follow @xmath0-dependence but the value of the factor in front of @xmath0 is still a remaining problem .",
    "the magnitude of this factor is an important issue since it is correlated with a particular choice for the upper limit for the elastic partial amplitude .",
    "namely , this limit ( it is @xmath1 in the case of the pure imaginary elastic scattering amplitude ) may correspond to the maximum of the inelastic channel contribution to the elastic unitarity and leads to the ratio @xmath2 or it can correspond to a maximal value of the partial amplitude allowed by unitarity ( i.e. unity ) resulting in the asymptotical limit @xmath3 in the above equations @xmath4 denotes integral cross ",

    "( [ bd ] ) corresponds to the limiting case of the so called bel picture .",
    "the acronym bel has the meaning that the interaction region of protons becomes blacker , edgier and larger with increasing energy .",
    "this kind of energy evolution was proposed and discussed in @xcite .",
    "such behaviour corresponds to the presupposed absorptive nature of the scattering when the elastic scattering partial amplitude would never exceed the black disc limit of @xmath1 . with this assumption of the absorptive scattering domination",
    "the original froissart - martin bound for the total cross - sections has been improved by factor of @xmath1 .",
    "an origin for appearance of this factor is an upper bound for the total inelastic cross - section reduced by factor of 4 ( cf .",
    "thus , the related ratio of the cross ",
    "sections @xmath11 is an important function of energy , e.g. it stands in front of @xmath0 in the asymptotical bound on the total cross - section @xcite : @xmath12 ^ 2 \\left[1+\\left(\\frac{\\mbox{re } f(s , t=0)}{\\mbox{im } f(s , t=0)}\\right)^2\\right]^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the amplitude of the elastic scattering process @xmath14 . the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath13 is related to the amplitude in the impact parameter representation @xmath15 through the fourier - bessel transformation .",
    "since our consideration is a qualitative one , we will adopt for simplicity that the scale of @xmath16 in the above bound is determined by the energy - independent value @xmath17 gev@xmath18 ( i.e. @xmath19 is replaced by @xmath16 and the latter is considered to be dimensionless , despite that this scale is an energy - dependent one and is determined by @xmath20 ) in the above bound for the total cross  section . in eq .",

    "in this note , an upper bound for the cross  section of inelastic diffraction is discussed .",
    "we point out a problem with an existing upper bound for the cross  section of inelastic diffraction .",
    "in fact , the existing , pumplin bound @xcite , has been derived under assumption of the absorptive nature of diffraction at all the energies . a generalized bound which is free from such restriction and valid in the whole range of the elastic scattering amplitude variation allowed by unitarity",
    "is obtained .",
    "we also discuss its implications on the model ground .",
    "a distinctive feature of the impact parameter representation is a diagonal form of the unitarity equation for the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath25 eq .",
    "( [ unit ] ) is valid at high energies with @xmath26 precision @xcite .",
    "the @xmath27 is the elastic channel contribution , while the inelastic overlap function @xmath28 includes all contributions from the intermediate inelastic channels into unitarity relation .",
    "the elastic scattering @xmath29-matrix element in the impact parameter representation is related to the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath15 by the equation @xmath30 and it can be represented in the form @xmath31\\ ] ] which includes the two real functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the function @xmath34 ( it varies in the region @xmath35 ) is called an absorption factor : its value @xmath36 corresponds to a complete absorption of the initial state .",
    "as it was already mentioned , we assume the pure imaginary scattering amplitude in the region where the both limits are saturated @xcite .",
    "the recent data @xcite on the precise measurements of the ratio of the real to the imaginary part of the forward amplitude are consistent with decreasing energy dependence of this ratio . ] and perform the replacement @xmath37 at high energies .",
    "we should also mention that the pumplin bound discussed below has been derived with the approximation of pure imaginary amplitudes of the elastic and diffractive scattering .",
    "the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath15 is related then to the elastic scattering matrix element by the relation @xmath38 , i.e. the function @xmath39 is real , but it should not have a definite sign in the whole range of the amplitude variation allowed by unitarity . on the base of the existing experimental trends a monotonic , without oscillations over @xmath16 , increase of the elastic scattering amplitude @xmath15 with the energy is assumed .",
    "in fact , the choice of the particular elastic scattering mode , namely , absorptive or reflective one @xcite , depends on the sign of the function @xmath39 , in another words , on the value of the phase @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the widely used picture is based on the limit @xmath40 at fixed impact parameter @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "this is known as a black - disc limit .",
    "the elastic scattering is a completely absorptive one in this mode and the function @xmath39 is always non - negative and the limitation @xmath43 is implied .",
    "there is another mode ( reflective scattering ) when the function @xmath29 becomes negative with energy growth .",
    "it has the limiting behavior @xmath44 at fixed @xmath41 and @xmath42 , i.e. @xmath45 and @xmath46 and the amplitude varies in the range @xmath47 since the function @xmath29 is negative . the non - zero phase @xmath46 can be interpreted as the geometric phase and its appearance is related to the presence of a dynamical singularity @xcite .",
    "which mode will be realized at the asymptotical energies is unclear now .",
    "the claims on the equipartition of the elastic and inelastic collision probabilities at @xmath42 are the model - dependent ones .",
    "moreover , conclusions on such equipartition are ambiguous without impact parameter analysis performed .",
    "the respective conclusions @xcite are based on the forward scattering data only and are not trustworthy therefore .",
    "the base for such statement is grounded on the fact that the forward scattering observables are represented by definite integrals over impact parameter .",
    "it is obvious , that an integration does not allow one to reconstruct an integrand since different functions can lead to the same results after integration ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite where the equipartition @xmath48 at @xmath49 has been obtained just for a gaussian exponential dependence of the profile function saturating unitarity limit .",
    "such function has nothing to do with the black disc model ) .",
    "it is known that soft hadron interaction dynamics is determined by the nonperturbative qcd .",
    "since it does not provide calculation recipe at the moment , the essential role under discussion of soft processes belongs to general principles of the theory such as unitarity and analyticity , as it was mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we start with discussion of an upper bound in the impact parameter representation .",
    "the assumption on absorptive scattering domination at all the energies including asymptotics was an essential point under derivation of the pumplin bound @xcite for the inelastic diffraction : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the total cross  section of all the inelastic diffractive processes in the impact parameter representation and @xmath52 the bound eq .",
    "( [ pump ] ) was obtained in the framework of the good  walker formalism for the inelastic diffraction @xcite and is based on the eikonal form of the diffractive amplitudes .",
    "this form can be considered as one of the realizations of the absorptive scattering mode .",
    "( [ pump ] ) is valid for each value of the impact parameter of the collision @xmath41 , i.e. it is diagonal in @xmath41-space and integration over impact parameter provides : @xmath53 it should be emphasized again that eqs .",
    "( [ bd ] ) and ( [ pumpint ] ) are to be fulfilled if the hadron scattering picture corresponding to the black - disc limit is valid at asymptotical energies , i.e. @xmath54 while @xmath55 and @xmath56 at @xmath49 .",
    "it is difficult to reconcile those limits .",
    "indeed , @xmath57 is , by definition , a leading part of the inelastic cross  section @xmath6 and the lhc experimental data demonstrate approximate energy  independence of ratio @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "in contrast to its definition and the available data , one should conclude then , that the inelastic diffraction corresponds , in fact , to a sub - leading mechanism in the inelastic cross - section and the leading role in the growth of @xmath6 belongs to the nondiffractive inelastic processes .",
    "such a statement is not easy to reconcile with the definition of the diffractive processes and their energy dependence , i.e. the eq .",
    "( [ bdindi ] ) is not in favor of the black - disc limit saturation by the partial scattering amplitude at @xmath59 .",
    "we also note that eq .",
    "( [ pump ] ) can be rewritten in terms of @xmath39 in the form @xmath60 and this inequality indicates that the pumplin bound on @xmath61 can not be applied in the region where @xmath39 becomes negative .",
    "apparently , there is no embarrassment in the approach which allows saturation of the unitarity limit . the limiting dependence eq .",
    "( [ rd ] ) assumes an alternative option which corresponds to saturation of the unitarity limit for the elastic partial amplitude and can be interpreted as a reflective scattering @xcite .",
    "saturation of unitarity can be associated with the strong coherent parton interactions in qcd relevant to confinement dynamics .",
    "the inelastic overlap function at the asymptotical energies will acquire a peripheral form in the impact parameter representation @xcite .",
    "this peripherality was treated as a manifestation of an emerging transparency in the central hadron collisions ( or in vicinity of the impact parameter @xmath62 of the colliding particles ) at very high energies .",
    "later on , this interpretation has been generalized and specified in papers @xcite where such a phenomenon was related to antishadowing or reflection in the hadron interactions .",
    "it should be noted that the concept of the on - shell optical potential also lead up to conclusion on the central grayness in the inelastic overlap function @xcite .",
    "the peripheral form of the inelastic overlap function appears at high energies due to acquiring negative values by @xmath39 with the collision energy increase : @xmath63 thus , the central profile of @xmath15 transforms with the energy growth into a peripheral profile of the function @xmath28 due to negative values of @xmath39 .",
    "the appearing of peripheral form of the inelastic overlap function is an energy - dependent effect .",

    "it should be noted that the available experimental data are consistent with decreasing dependence of the ratio @xmath72 with energy .",
    "the possibility that the elastic amplitude exceeds the value of @xmath1 ( which corresponds to the black - disc limit ) was discussed earlier in the framework of the rational unitarization on the base of the cdf data obtained at tevatron @xcite .",

    "the exceeding of the black - disc limit of @xmath1 turns the pumplin bound to be groundless @xcite .",
    "but , this conclusion deserves to be more specified .",
    "in fact , the pumplin bound is not valid only in the particular region of the small and moderate values of the impact parameter where the absorptive approach becomes not applicable .",
    "such region of impact parameter values appears at very high energy .",

    "the above generalization has a practical meaning since there is a definite indication that the black - disc limit has been exceeded in the central hadron collisions at the lhc energy @xmath67 tev @xcite .",
    "despite that the asymptotic regime is not reached at the lhc energies , there are certain indications on the turn - on of the transitional regime at these energies where elastic scattering starts to dominate at small impact parameters .",

    "the various dynamical models can be used for the function @xmath110 . to get the qualitative estimates we are using the simplified form of this function which conforms to rising total cross - section and analytical properties over the transferred momentum , i.e. @xmath111 where @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 are some constants .",
    "( [ umf ] ) resembles form used by heisenberg in his model for the total cross  sections of the inelastic processes @xcite .",
