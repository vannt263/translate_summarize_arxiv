    "in this paper we analyze the practical consequences of the bilateral counterparty risk adjustment .",
    "we point out that past literature assumes that , at the moment of default , a risk - free closeout amount will be used .",
    "the closeout amount is the net present value of the residual deal which is computed when one party defaults , and that is used for default settlement .",
    "a risk - free closeout amount is a net present value that assumes that the surviving counterparty is default - free .",
    "we argue here that the legal ( isda ) documentation on the settlement of a default does not confirm this assumption .",
    "documentation suggests in many points that a ` substitution closeout ' should be used , namely a net present value of the residual deal as computed from a third market player that is eager to become the counterparty of the survived party for the residual deal , replacing the defaulted one .",
    "such a substitution closeout can be different from a risk - free one .",
    "as a first difference , it would take into account the risk of default of the survived party , since a real market counterparty would never neglect it .",
    "the counterparty risk adjustments changes strongly when a substitution closeout amount is considered , and we show how to compute it .",
    "also the effects at the moment of default of a company are very different under the two closeout conventions , with some dramatic consequences on default contagion .",
    "we show this in the following . in the current uncertainty about",
    "which closeout will be used in future defaults , our results should be considered carefully by the financial community , lest there are unpleasant surprises at the moment of default of a counterparty .",
    "we analyze the practical consequences of the two different ways of computing the closeout amount .",
    "we show on a simple derivative that the standard formula for bilateral counterparty risk adjustment , assuming risk - free closeout , is not consistent with the market practice on simple uncollateralized defaultable claims such as bonds or loans or options .",
    "in fact it causes the initial price of a deal to depend crucially on the risk of default of one party that has no future obligations in the deal . in case of a simple ` bond ' or ` option ' deal ,",
    "it would make the price to depend on the risk of default of the ` lender ' , namely the party which has not future payments to make in the deal , such as the bond buyer or the option buyer .",
    "this feature is not consistent with current market practices and is counterintuitive .",
    "we show that this feature can be avoided by using the formula with substitution closeout that we introduce in this paper . in this sense ,",
    "the substitution closeout formula that we introduce appears as the right choice to achieve consistency with market practice for uncollateralized deals .",
    "however , the substitution closeout formula is not immune to problems .",
    "the main one regards the consistency with collateral computations for collateralized deals .",
    "the collateral is calculated computing a risk - free net present value .",
    "if the closeout is not risk - free how could the collateral amount and the closeout amount match at default in such a way that no losses are suffered by any party , as one would expect for collateralized deals ? in the following we propose an explanation of how this can be the case even for a substitution closeout , but the issue would appear to be trivially solved under a risk - free closeout .",
    "we also observe that , if we consider the above simple uncollateralized bond deals under scenarios of perfect default dependency between the two counterparties , the risk - free closeout cva is either the same as the substitution closeout cva ( this happens when the lender has lower credit spreads , so that he never defaults first and we are in practice in a unilateral cva ) or it has a behaviour that could be considered not to be illogic , contrary to the substitution closeout .",
    "this second case happens when the lender has higher credit spreads ; in this case the risk - free closeout says that any bond should be treated as risk - free ; this could be justified by the fact that the lender always defaults first so he will never be impacted by the default of the borrower .",
    "the situation changes when we consider counterparties with independent default risk , as we detail below .",
    "another important point in comparing the two closeout formulations is understanding what happens upon default of one counterparty .",
    "in particular we focus on the case that shows the most striking differences with the unilateral case : the default of the counterparty with no future payments in the deal , the ` lender ' in a synthetic loan transaction .",
    "let us start with a quite relevant problem of the risk free closeout , having possibly destabilizing consequences .",
    "when one of our counterparties defaults , we not only have losses if we are creditors of the defaulted company , we may have potentially large losses even if we are debtors , and these losses will be higher the higher our credit spreads .",
    "this fact is so central that it is worth repeating it : if we are debtors of a counterparty and this counterparty defaults , the accounting of bilateral counterparty risk given in previous literature prescribes that the default event of our creditor suddenly increases the amount of money that we have to pay .",
    "we illustrate this by sketching a practical example where we consider a bank that funded itself through a derivative .",
    "the bank finds out that default of the lender makes its liabilities grow from 579 million to 927 million just as an effect of the closeout assumption .",
    "this is a loss of 348 million on a funding deal of 1 billion notional .",
    "as we show in the following under the assumption of independence between lender and borrower , a substitution closeout would avoid this sudden loss and lead to a continuous counterparty risk mark - to - market for the borrower if the lender defaults .",
    "again , however , if we assume perfect dependence , there are additional considerations to make .",
    "we present a case where the default of the lender causes the liabilities of the borrower to decrease from 856bn to 0 if we consider the substitution closeout .",
    "this is a stylized representation of a not - impossible real world scenario where the default of one entity causes the spread of its counterparties to jump extremely high .",
    "this deflates their liabilities towards the defaulted company if we take into account their default probability in computing the closeout amount .",
    "this shows what is the main criticism that can be made to the substitution closeout : at the moment of default it protects the borrowers of the defaulted company , but in doing this it reduces the amount received by the creditors of the defaulted company ( it reduces the recovery ) .",
    "thus , the risk - free closeout increases the number of operators subject to contagion from a default , including parties that currently seem not to think they are exposed , and this is certainly a negative fact . on the other hand ,",
    "it spreads the default losses on higher number of parties and reduces the classic contagion channel affecting creditors . for the creditors , this is certainly a positive fact .",
    "it seems to us that this issue had never been studied thoroughly before , as confirmed by the fact that an absolute standard for the computation of the closeout amount seems not to exist among practitioners .",
    "our mathematical and numerical results suggest that the issue should be considered carefully , both by practitioners and by regulators , since it has strong economic relevance , and in particular it can affect the contagion effect of a default event .",
    "in section 2 we present the formulas introduced by previous literature for counterparty risk adjustments . in section 3",
    "we analyze these formulas to clarify what they assume about the computation of the closeout amount , and we propose a closeout amount different from the risk - free one , namely the substitution closeout .",
    "then in sections 4 and 5 we analyze isda documentation . in section 6",
    "we perform the quantitative analysis of the problem .",
    "we first apply the alternative formulas to a very simple payoff , revealing that only the substitution closeout appears consistent with market practice for bonds and loans , while the risk - free closeout introduces even at initial time @xmath0 a dependence on the risk of default of the party with no future obligation .",
    "the pattern of this unusual dependence is detailed numerically .",
    "then we quantify the losses or the benefit , respectively , that a borrower would suffer in case of default of the lender when the substitution or risk - free closeouts are applied in the respective cases of independence and total default dependence .",
    "we have decided to consider only these limit cases - perfect dependence and independence - because they allow us to make claims which are as model - independent as possible , avoiding the use of black - box copula models and associated concepts such as default correlation.    in section 7 we show that when the substitution closeout is used the combination of a defaultable deal and a collateral agreement may lead naturally to a default - free deal , as it should be .",
    "finally in the appendix we show a number of mathematical properties , such as symmetry , of the formula with substitution closeout that we introduce in this work .",
    "we consider two parties in a derivative transaction : @xmath1 ( investor ) and @xmath2 ( counterparty ) .",
    "we call @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively , the default time , the recovery and the loss given default of party @xmath6 , with @xmath7 .",
    "the risk - free discount factor is @xmath8where @xmath9 is the risk - free short - rate .",
    "we define @xmath10 to be the discounted cashflows of the derivative from @xmath11 to @xmath12 seen from the point of view of @xmath1 , with @xmath13 .",
    "the net present value of the derivative at @xmath11 is@xmath14 , \\]]where @xmath15 indicates the risk - neutral expectation based on market information up to time @xmath11 . notice that this , in general , includes default monitoring ,",
    "i.e. the filtration at time @xmath11 includes @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the risk neutral probability measure conditional on the same information at time @xmath11 .",
    "the subscript @xmath1 indicates that this value is seen from the point of view of @xmath1 , the superscript @xmath0 indicates that we are considering both parties as default - free . obviously , @xmath18 .",
    "the early literature on counterparty risk adjustment , see for example brigo and masetti ( 2005 ) , introduced ` unilateral risk of default ' . here only the default of counterparty @xmath2 is considered , while the investor @xmath1 is treated as default free . under this assumption ,",

    "\\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]now we introduce the main theme of this paper .",
    "all formulas for counterparty risk adjustment are based on precise assumptions on what happens when there is a default event .",
    "let us start from the unilateral case ( formula_unilateral_forall ) .",
    "when the default of the counterparty happens before maturity ( look at the part of the formula following the indicator of event @xmath33 ) , the total payout is made of two parts : the cashflows received before default , @xmath34 , and the present value of the payout at default time @xmath35 . at @xmath35",
    "the residual deal is marked - to - market .",
    "the mark - to - market of the residual deal at an early termination time is called _ closeout amount _ in the jargon of isda documentation .",
    "here it is given by@xmath36where the left - hand side is seen from the perspective of the investor and the right - hand side from the one of the counterparty . if the closeout amount is positive to @xmath2 , which is the defaulting party , and negative to @xmath1 , which has not defaulted , @xmath1 will pay this amount entirely to the liquidators of the counterparty",
    ". if the closeout amount is instead positive to @xmath1 and negative to @xmath2 , the liquidators of the latter will pay to @xmath1 only a recovery fraction of the closeout amount .",
    "these provisions lead to the payout at default of ( [ formula_unilateral_forall ] ) , given by@xmath37notice that , as indicated by the superscript @xmath0 , here the closeout amount @xmath38 is computed treating the residual deal as a _ default - free _ deal .",
    "the reason for that is obvious .",
    "there are two parties @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and party @xmath1 is supposed default - free so it will never default , while party @xmath2 has already defaulted and this is taken into account by the fact that , in case @xmath39 , @xmath2 will pay only a recovery fraction of the default - free closeout amount .",
    "this default - free closeout is also a substitution closeout , in the sense that , if @xmath1 wanted to substitute the defaulted deal with another one where the counterparty is default - free , the counterparty would ask @xmath1 to pay @xmath38 , a risk - free closeout since both parties are risk - free .",
    "now let us look at the pricing formula ( formula_biilateral_counterparty_+- ) for bilateral risk of default .",
    "the payout at default is now given by@xmath40\\]]here both @xmath1 and @xmath2 can default , and what matters is who defaults first . if the counterparty @xmath2 defaults first , then @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and we have the same payout as in the unilateral case of ( [ formula_unilateral_defaultpayoff ] ) .",
    "if the investor @xmath1 defaults first , the payout is reversed : when the closeout amount is positive to the defaulted investor , this amount is received fully , while if it is negative only a recovery fraction will be paid to the counterparty , leading to@xmath44 .\\]]notice that , like in the unilateral case , also with bilateral risk of default the closeout amount _ is computed treating the residual deal as default - free _",
    "@xmath45we are again excluding the possibility of default of either party .",
    "is this assumption as obviously justified here as it was in the unilateral case ?",
    "not quite . only the assumption of ignoring the risk of default of @xmath24 is justified obviously .",
    "in fact @xmath24 has defaulted , and this is accounted for correctly by computing a closeout amount where there is no possibility of another default of @xmath24 , and then , in case this amount is negative to @xmath24 , assuming that @xmath24 will pay only a recovery fraction of it .",
    "but the other party @xmath25 has not defaulted , and now it is not true that it will never default in the future .",
    "there is a non - negligible probability that it defaults before the maturity @xmath12 of the residual deal .",
    "thus it is unclear why the mark - to - market of a residual deal where one of the two parties has not yet defaulted and can default in the future should be treated as default free . here",
    "risk - free closeout amount _ ( formula_bilateralriskfreecloseout ) is not a substitution closeout .",
    "in fact if the survived party @xmath25 wanted to substitute the defaulted deal with another one where the market counterparty is default free , the counterparty would ask @xmath25 to pay not the opposite of ( formula_bilateralriskfreecloseout ) but@xmath46because the market counterparty can not ignore the default risk of party @xmath25 from @xmath29 to the maturity @xmath12 of the residual deal . thus the amount ( [ formula_bilateralsubstitutioncloseout ] )",
    "will be called in the following _ substitution closeout amount_. it is given by ( formula_unilateral_counterparty ) when @xmath47 and by ( formula_unilateral_counterparty2 ) when @xmath48 .",

    "\\notag\\end{aligned}\\]]in the rest of the paper we analyze this formula under two points of view .",
    "first , we want to understand if it is more appropriate than formula ( formula_biilateral_counterparty_long ) used in the previous literature . for this analysis",
    "we consider    \\1 ) the isda documentation on derivatives , to understand the legal prescriptions and the financial rationale that should be followed in computing the closeout amount    \\2 ) which one between the substitution closeout amount assumed by ( formula_bilateral righr ) and the risk - free one assumed by ( formula_biilateral_counterparty_long ) is simpler to be applied in case of a real default .",
    "\\3 ) the financial effects of using ( [ formula_bilateral righr ] ) rather than ( [ formula_biilateral_counterparty_long ] ) , to see which one minimizes the default contagion in case of default , which one is more consistent with market standards on consolidated financial products and which one fits better with market practices to minimize default risk such as csa collateral agreements .",
    "one observation is in order about this plan of analysis .",
    "the reader may think that the first step to take is to ask experienced practitioners which approach is applied in practice for the computation of closeout . we have done this ( and we thank for that in particular the participants to global derivatives 2010 in paris ) and surprisingly enough we have found different opinions .",
    "this variety of opinions can be related to the fact that the isda documentation had given a ( relatively ) open definition of closeout amount , and more importantly to the fact that full awareness of the importance of cva and dva has arisen just _",
    "lehman s default , the last important default that may work as a benchmark . at that time",
    "libor discounting  was mainly used for closeout , and this is somehow in - between a risk - free discounting and a discounting taking full consideration of the risk of default of the remaining party .",
    "then , in the appendix , we analyze the new formula ( [ formula_bilateral righr ] ) under a mathematical point of view .",

    "the document that should set a standard for the computation of the close - out amount in case of a default event is the isda ( 2009 ) close - out amount protocol .",
    "nowhere in this document one finds a precise formula for the computation of the close - out amount , however one can find there practical principles that can shed some light on the issue we are considering .",
    "we read at page 13 that `` if the early termination date results from an event of default '' , this early termination will be settled by the transfer of `` the close - out amount or close - out amounts ( whether positive or negative ) determined by the non - defaulting party '' .",
    "the non - defaulting party that determines the closeout amount is party @xmath25 in our notation .",
    "then at page 15 we have the following prescription : `` in determining a close - out amount , the determining party may consider any relevant information , including , without limitation , one or more of the following types of information : ( i ) quotations ( either firm or indicative ) for replacement transactions supplied by one or more third parties that may take into account the creditworthiness of the determining party at the time the quotation is provided '' .",
    "this is in contrast with the default - free closeout amount @xmath54 prescribed by the classic formula , and seems instead consistent with the substitution - cost closeout amount @xmath55 prescribed by the formula given in this paper , that includes the risk of default of the survived party @xmath25 .",
    "the isda documentation is not so strict to make this a binding prescription - the document speaks of a determining party that _ may _ take into account its own creditworthiness . thus the risk - free closeout amount is not excluded .",
    "various other points in the documentation confirm that a substitution closeout is more likely .",
    "one of the clearest is in the market review of otc derivative bilateral collateralization practices , published by isda on march 1 , 2010 , that says : \" upon default close - out , valuations will in many circumstances reflect the replacement cost of transactions calculated at the terminating party s bid or offer side of the market , _ and will often take into account the credit - worthiness of the terminating party_.    the same document , however , points out that this substitution closeout risks being a problem for collateralized derivatives , since it seems at odds with the computation of collateral amount : however , it should be noted that exposure is calculated at mid - market levels so as not to penalize one party or the other . as a result of this , the amount of collateral held to secure exposure may be more or less than the termination payment determined upon a close - out \" .",
    "we analyze this issue in detail in section [ section_collateral ] .",
    "the above analysis shows a financial rationale in the isda documents in favor of a substitution closeout , but it also shows that the same documents leave room for other solutions .",
    "there is one point in strong favor of a risk - free closeout : the simplicity of computation , since it does not require an assessment of the risk of default of the survived party . in the settlement of a default ,",
    "if a risk - free closeout is used , then all contracts with the same payoff would have the same closeout value , irrespectively of the counterparty , which is an important simplification .",
    "this risk - free amount would not be difficult to compute in the market because it would correspond to the mark - to - market of a deal equal to the residual deal but for the fact of being collateralized .",
    "of course some parties could find it unfair . in the end",
    "the defaulted deal was not collateralized , and at inception it had different prices for different parties because of the different default risks of the parties .",
    "some may not accept now a unique collateralized closeout amount . in spite of this , the homogeneity of the risk - free closeout amount is a strong point in favor of this solution , maybe just as a simpler approximation to the substitution closeout , if the error turns out to be not too big .",
    "the above considerations do not appear sufficient to clarify our minds and settle the matter without a more quantitative analysis .",
    "we perform such analysis in the following .",
    "since we are dealing with a matter that would affect even the simplest derivative in case of default , we find an analysis with very simple - albeit not unrealistic - models and transactions to be much more instructive than the application of some elaborate model to a complex derivative , that would just risk increasing the confusion .",
    "once we have sorted out the basic case , we can think of addressing more complex payouts in future work .",
    "we perform a  mathematical and numerical analysis of the consequences of the two approaches .",
    "we consider a contract where party @xmath2 enters at time @xmath0 into the commitment to pay  a unit of money at time @xmath12 to party @xmath1 .",
    "this claim has exactly the same payoff as the prototypical zero - coupon bond or loan of the textbooks on finance .",
    "party @xmath2 is the borrower or bond issuer , and @xmath1 is the lender or bond holder .",
    "this payoff is convenient for our purposes because there is a consolidated standard on how to price it .",
    "we will see which one between risk - free and substitution liquidation is consistent with the practice developed in the loan and bond markets .",
    "the comparison with the bond market is particularly interesting for a further reason .",
    "when bilateral counterparty risk was first introduced , there was some discussion in the market about one consequence of it : when a bank includes its own risk of default in the pricing of a deal , it can actually book a profit when there is an increase of its credit spreads .",
    "this is a rather bizarre fact .",
    "however supporters of this approach pointed out that this already happens for banks with reference to bond issuances .",
    "banks have the so - called _ fair value option _ , namely the possibility to account for issued bonds in their balance - sheets at mark - to - market .",
    "when this is done , the bond liabilities decrease in value when credit spreads increase , and the bank can mark a profit .",
    "this consistency with the treatment of bonds has contributed to make the dva more accepted in the market . below we will show some practical effects of bilateral counterparty risk adjustments under risk - free closeout or substitution closeout . by observing these effects on a bond - like payoff , we are using the payoff that has already been the main reference for understanding the appropriateness of counterparty risk adjustments .      in the following we take deterministic interest rates .",
    "first we evaluate this derivative bond deal using unilateral formulas , namely considering only the default of the borrower counterparty @xmath2 ( here the default of @xmath1 is neglected from the payout irrespectively of the fact that it may default or not ) .",

    "we can compute easily also @xmath58 , the value when only the default of the lender @xmath1 is taken into account .",
    "we have@xmath59we have obtained the price of a risk - free bond , thus the formula says that in a loan or bond what matters is the risk of default of the borrower .",

    "however we do not use this example because we think it is realistic , but to point out some extreme consequences of the choice about the closeout .    in the above setup",

    "he has a sudden loss of @xmath148due to default of the lender .",
    "this way of regulating bilateral counterparty risk leads to a default contagion that extends not only to the creditors , but also , and in a more sudden way , to the debtors of the defaulted company .",
    "this is a worrying effect that regulators can hardly consider desirable .",
    "additionally , formulas ( [ formula_biilateral_counterparty_long ] ) and ( formula_biilateral_counterparty_for bond ) show clearly that the loss is higher the higher the credit spreads , and this is what makes this kind of contagion particularly dangerous .",
    "finally , notice that this book loss of @xmath149mln will soon become a material , realized loss because the borrower has to pay it to the liquidators of the defaulted lender , well before the original maturity of the deal .",
    "furthermore , this behaviour is not consistent with financial practice in the bond and loan market , where there are no big losses to the borrower or bond issuer due to the default of a lender or a bond - holder .",
    "this makes the behaviour particularly undesirable .",
    "we mentioned at the beginning of this section that with bilateral counterparty risk banks can book a profit when their own risk of default increases , and that this somewhat disturbing fact has been accepted also because it is consistent with the fair value option in the booking of bonds .",
    "here we have found another disturbing effect when a risk - free closeout is considered : a sudden and big gain for the lender s liquidators when the lender himself defaults , and a symmetric big loss for the borrower .",
    "this is even more disturbing , and it is not even consistent with market practice on bonds .",
    "the bond practice is instead consistent with the substitution closeout . in this case , applying ( [ formula_bilateral righr ] ) we have@xmath150there is no discontinuity and no loss for the borrower in case of default of the lender .",
    "we point out that the above example could be extended easily to those more complex derivative payoffs where there are , like in the derivative bond , a clear lender and a clear borrower that do not change through the life of the deal .",
    "a party @xmath6 is a lender when @xmath151 , @xmath152 , while he is a borrower if @xmath153 , @xmath152 .",
    "payoffs that generate this situation are very common .",

    "such party becomes a net borrower and in case of default of the other party would suffer , following a risk - free closeout , losses similar to those outlined above .",
    "we now take an example where the two default times have constant intensities and are co - monotonic , and we will see , conversely , that this time the substitution closeout has a dramatic effect for the creditors and liquidators of the defaulted company .",
    "we assume @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath123 , @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "this setting means that @xmath159 always defaults first , since following formula ( [ formula_comonotonicdefaults])@xmath160 we still assume a notional of 1bn .",
    "the initial value to the borrower of the bond under bilateral counterparty risk for the risk free closeout is@xmath161namely the risk - free value , consistently with the example we showed in section [ section_comonotonicdefaults ] .",
    "the value of the bond under substitution closeout is@xmath162now let us see what happens when the lender a defaults at 2.5y .",
    "we need to remember that we are in a situation where a defaults always before b , and where we know exactly that , if a defaults at 2.5y , b defaults in 2.77y .",
    "this is clearly a purely toy case , but it approximates a possibly realistic one : the case of a company b that , as an effect of the default of a , sees its own risk of default increase dramatically , going to the verge of default .    in such a case",
    "the risk free closeout gives us the same value both immediately before and after default , namely , to the lender a:@xmath163with no discontinuity , whereas the substitution closeout implies a jump from@xmath164to @xmath165due to the fact that the model implies that the borrower will default at 2.77y , which is before the maturity , the substitution closeout , that takes into account the default risk of the counterparty , sees a null value for the bond .",
    "in other terms , at the default of the lender , the creditors and liquidators of the lender see all their claims towards the borrower lose their value .",
    "this confirms that the substitution closeout reduces the claims of the creditors towards the debtors of the defaulted entity , and this effect is stronger the stronger is the default dependence between the defaulted entity and its borrowers",

    "provides the net lender with an amount of liquidity equal to the risk - free net present value of @xmath6 .",

    "if instead the borrower defaults earlier , the collateral must be used to offset the default loss .",
    "we analyze in detail what happens at default considering a very simple payoff where @xmath166 and must be paid at @xmath12 , namely the simple derivative bond considered above .",
    "the borrower must give at time @xmath0 to the lender an amount of liquidity equal to the risk - free net present value of the future payoff , @xmath167then the borrower must update regularly this quantity , in such a way that the collateral remains equal at any time @xmath11 to the net present value of the future payoff , @xmath168the collateral is updated daily .",
    "we approximate this daily settlement with a continuous settlement . in this case , in order to keep the collateral @xmath169 at @xmath170 , the borrower must pay to the lender continuously an amount@xmath171 in fact it is trivial to show that if@xmath172then@xmath173as desired .",
    "on the other hand , the lender that keeps the collateral @xmath174 must give back to the borrower the interest generated continuously by @xmath169 .",
    "this transforms into a continuous payment@xmath175made by the lender to the borrower .",
    "we immediately notice that the settlement payment ( [ formula_settlement payment ] ) made by the borrower cancels out with the interest payment ( formula_interespt payment ) made by the lender .",

    "the collateral remains with the lender and earns interest in time at rate @xmath9 , this interest @xmath177 is not returned to the borrower but added to the value of the collateral , that in this way is always @xmath168      if we consider the risk - free closeout , the requirement of a match between the closeout and the value of the collateral at the first default @xmath35 among those of the two counterparties appears trivially obtained .",
    "the risk - free closeout amount is always @xmath178 the value of the collateral at @xmath35 is always@xmath179if we just say that the collateral is an amount of money to be used to offset the default closeout , it turns out that the lender always has the right amount of money to offset the default closeout .      however , if we take a less naive view we remember that collateral is not just an amount of money but a contract with specific features .",
    "this contract has a value at default and it is this value , not the amount of money held by the lender , that needs to match the closeout amount . if this happens , there will be no transfer on money at default of a collateralized party and no losses for any party , exactly as we expect for a collateralized deal .",
    "we show in the following that this can be obtained rather easily with a substitution closeout .",
    "if we think of the practical working of collateral , we can treat collateral as an amount of money given to the lender from the borrower coupled with a claim of the borrower towards the lender to have this collateral back . if there is no default of the borrower before maturity , the borrower has a claim to have the collateral back at termination of the deal , namely a payoff @xmath180 at maturity @xmath12 upon no default:@xmath181if instead the default of the borrower happens before maturity , the borrower has a claim to receive the collateral back at its own default time @xmath182 @xmath183 in this simple setting we can easily check what happens when there is a default , either of the borrower or of the lender . in case",
    "the borrower defaults first , the closeout amount that the borrower should give to the lender is @xmath184at the same time the borrower has the right to receive back the collateral , which has a value@xmath184there is a perfect netting and a perfect match of collateral value and closeout amount of the deal at default . no money is transferred and no loss is suffered , as it should be for collateralized deals .",
    "this holds no matter whether we consider risk - free or substitution closeout , since we are considering the default of the borrower . at default of the borrower",
    "the residual net present value is risk free under either closeout .",
    "more interesting is the case of the default of the lender at @xmath185 , @xmath102 .",
    "the borrower has a claim to receive back the collateral at maturity if the borrower itself does not default .",
    "the discounted expected value of such a claim is@xmath186 .",
    "\\label{formula_discounted_collateral}\\]]the claim of the lender depends on the choice about the closeout amount . in case of substitution closeout ,",
    "the value of the lender s claim is the discounted expected payoff of the deal taking into account the possibility that @xmath102 defaults in the future,@xmath186 .\\]]again there is a perfect netting and a perfect match of collateral value and closeout amount of the deal at default .",
    "no money is transferred and no loss is suffered , as it should be for collateralized deals . when no default happens before maturity , the lender gives the collateral back to the borrower , again consistently with the practical working of collateral .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the effect of the assumptions about the computation of the closeout amount on the counterparty risk adjustments of derivatives .",
    "we have compared the risk - free closeout assumed in the earlier literature with the substitution closeout we introduce here , which is inspired by the financial rationale contained in the recent isda documentation on the subject .",
    "we have provided a formula for bilateral counterparty risk when a substitution closeout is used at default .",
    "we have reckoned that the substitution closeout is consistent with counterparty risk adjustments for standard and consolidated financial products such as bonds and loans . on the contrary",
    "the risk - free closeout introduces at time @xmath0 a dependence on the risk of default of the party with no future obligations .",
    "we have also shown that in case of risk - free closeout a party that is a net debtor of a company will have a sudden loss at the default of the latter , and this loss is higher the higher the debtor s credit spreads .",
    "this does not happen when a substitution closeout is considered .",
    "thus , the risk - free closeout increases the number of operators subject to contagion from a default , including parties that currently seem not to think they are exposed , and this is certainly a negative fact . on the other hand",
    ", it spreads the default losses on higher number of parties and reduces the classic contagion channel affecting creditors .",
    "for the creditors , this is a positive fact because it brings more money to the liquidators of the defaulted company .",
    "additionally , a risk - free closeout is easier to implement at default time , since it corresponds to the net present value of a collateralized version of the deal .",
    "thanks to this , one can also find it easier to understand why the provision of collateral makes a defaultable deal to become default - free . in the end , however , we have shown why if we take into account the contractual features of a collateral agreement , the provision of collateral makes a deal default free also when substitution closeout applies .",
    "we think that the closeout issue should be considered carefully by market operators and regulators .",
    "for example , if the risk - free closeout introduced in the previous literature had to be recognized as a standard , banks should understand the consequences of this .",
    "in fact banks usually perform stress tests and set aside reserves for the risk of default of their net borrowers , but do not consider any risk related to the default of net lenders .",
    "the above computations , and the numerical examples , show that , should a risk - free closeout prevail , banks had better set aside important reserves against this risk . on the other hand , under substitution closeout",
    ", banks can expect the recovery to be lowered when their net borrowers default , compared to the case when a risk free closeout applies . in case of a substitution closeout , in fact , the money collected by liquidators from the counterparties will be lower , since deflated by the default probability of the counterparties themselves , and this will be even more evident if they are strongly correlated to the defaulted entity .",
