    "large - scale , internet - connected distributed systems are notoriously difficult to manage . in a resource - sharing environment such as a peer - to - peer system that connects hundreds of thousands of computers in an ad - hoc network , intermittent resource participation , large and variable scale , and high failure rates are challenges that often impose performance tradeoffs .",
    "thus , existing p2p file - location mechanisms favor specific requirements : in gnutella , the emphasis is on accommodating highly volatile peers and on fast file retrieval , with no guarantees that files will always be located . in freenet @xcite , the emphasis is on ensuring anonymity . in contrast , distributed hash tables such as can @xcite , chord @xcite , pastry @xcite , and tapestry @xcite guarantee that files will always be located , but do not support wildcard searches .",
    "one way to optimize these tradeoffs is to understand user behavior . in this paper",
    "we analyze user behavior in three file - sharing communities in an attempt to get inspiration for designing efficient mechanisms for large - scale , dynamic , self - organizing resource - sharing communities .",
    "we look at these communities in a novel way : we study the relationships that form among users based on the data in which they are interested .",
    "we capture and quantify these relationships by modeling the community as a _ data - sharing graph_. to this end , we propose a new structure that captures common user interests in data ( section [ sec : dsg ] ) and justify its utility with studies on three data - distribution systems ( section [ sec:3communities ] ) : a high - energy physics collaboration , the web , and the kazaa peer - to - peer network .",
    "we find small - world patterns in the data - sharing graphs of all three communities ( section[sec : swdsg ] ) .",
    "we discuss the causes of these emergent small - world patterns in section [ sec : hnzl ] .",
    "the significance of these newly uncovered patterns is twofold ( section [ sec : dsg - uses ] ) : first , it explains previous results @xcite and confirms ( with formal support ) the intuition behind them .",
    "second , it suggests ways to design mechanisms that exploit these naturally emerging patterns .",
    "it is not news that understanding the system properties can help guide efficient solution design .",
    "a well known example is the relationship between file popularity in the web and cache size .",
    "the popularity of web pages has been shown to follow a zipf distribution @xcite : few pages are highly popular and many pages are requested few times . as a result , the efficiency of increasing cache size is not linear : caching is useful for the popular items , but there is little gain from increasing the cache to provision for unpopular items .    as a second example , many real networks are power law .",
    "that is , their node degrees are distributed according to a power law , such that a small number of nodes have large degrees , while most nodes have small degrees .",
    "adamic et al .",
    "@xcite propose a mechanism for probabilistic search in power - law networks that exploits exactly this characteristic : the search is guided first to nodes with high degree and their many neighbors . this way , a large percentage of the network is covered fast .",
    "this type of observations inspired us to look for patterns in user resources requests .",
    "but what patterns ?",
    "it is believed that the study of networks started with euler s solution of the knigsberg bridge problem in 1735 .",
    "the field has since extended from theoretical results to the analysis of patterns in real networks .",
    "social sciences have apparently the longest history in the study of real networks @xcite , with significant quantitative results dating from the 1920s @xcite",
    ".    the development of the internet added significant momentum to the study of networks : by both facilitating access to collections of data and by introducing new networks to study , such as the web graph , whose nodes are web pages and edges are hyperlinks @xcite , the internet at the router and the as level @xcite and the email graph @xcite .",
    "the study of large real networks led to fascinating results : recurring patterns emerge in real networks ( see @xcite for good surveys ) .",
    "for example , a frequent pattern is the power - law distribution of node degree , that is , a small number of nodes act as hubs ( having a large degree ) , while most nodes have a small degree .",
    "examples of power - law networks are numerous and from many domains : the phone - call network ( long distance phone calls made during a single day ) @xcite , the citation network @xcite , and the linguistics network @xcite ( pairs of words in english texts that appear at most one word apart ) . in computer science ,",
    "perhaps the first and most surprising result at its time was the proof that the random graph - based models of the internet ( with their poisson degree distribution ) were inaccurate : the internet topology had a power - law degree distribution @xcite .",
    "other results followed : the web graph @xcite and the gnutella overlay ( as of year 2000 ) @xcite are also power - law networks .",
    "another class of networks are the `` small worlds '' .",
    "two characteristics distinguish small - world networks : first , a small average path length , typical of random graphs ( here ` path ' means shortest node - to - node path ) ; second , a large clustering coefficient that is independent of network size . the clustering coefficient captures how many of a node s neighbors are connected to each other . this set of characteristics is identified in systems as diverse as social networks , in which nodes are people and edges are relationships ; the power grid system of western usa , in which nodes are generators , transformers , substations , etc . and edges are transmission lines ; and neural networks , in which nodes are neurons and edges are synapses or gap junctions @xcite .",
    "newman shows that scientific collaboration networks in different domains ( physics , biomedical research , neuroscience , and computer science ) have the characteristics of small worlds @xcite .",
    "collaboration networks connect scientists who have written articles together .",
    "moreover , girvan and newman @xcite show that well - defined groups ( such as a research group in a specific field ) can be identified in ( small - world ) scientific collaboration networks . in parallel , a theoretical model for small - world networks by watts and strogatz @xcite pictures a small world as a loosely connected set of highly connected subgraphs .    from here",
    ", the step is natural : since scientists tend to collaborate on publications , they most likely use the same resources ( _ share _ them ) during their collaboration : for example , they might use the same instruments to observe physics phenomena , or they might analyze the same data , using perhaps the same software tools or even a common set of computers .",
    "this means that if we connect scientists who use the same files , we might get a small world .",
    "even more , we might be able to identify groups that share the same resources . notice that the notion of `` collaboration '' transformed into `` resource sharing '' : the social relationships do not matter anymore , scientists who use the same resources within some time interval may never hear of each other .",
    "resource sharing in a ( predominantly ) scientific community is the driving force of computational grids .",
    "if we indeed see these naturally occurring sharing patterns and we find ways to exploit them ( e.g. , by identifying users grouped around common sets of resources ) , then we can build mechanisms that can tame the challenges typical of large - scale , dynamic , heterogeneous , latency - affected distributed systems .",
    "the research question now become clear :    * _ are there any patterns in the way scientists share resources that could be exploited for designing mechanisms ? _    but resource sharing also exists outside scientific communities : peer - to - peer systems or even the web facilitate the sharing of data .",
    "another question arises :    * _ are these characteristics typical of scientific communities or are they more general ? _    this article answers these two questions : it shows that small - world patterns exist in diverse file - sharing communities .",
    "to answer question _ q1 _ , we define a new graph that captures the virtual relationship between users who request the same data at about the same time .",
    "_ definition : the data - sharing graph is a graph in which nodes are users and an edge connects two users with similar interests in data . _    we consider one similarity criterion in this article : the number of shared requests within a specified time interval .    to answer question _ q2",
    "_ , we analyze the data - sharing graphs of three different file - sharing communities .",
    "section [ sec:3communities ] presents briefly these systems and the traces we used .",
    "we discover that in all cases , for different similarity criteria , these data - sharing graphs are small worlds .",
    "the next sections show that using the data - sharing graph for system characterization has potential both for basic science , because we can identify new structures emerging in real , dynamic networks ( section [ sec : swdsg ] ) ; and for system design , because we can exploit these structures when designing data location and delivery mechanisms ( section [ sec : dsg - uses ] ) .",
    "we study the characteristics of the data - sharing graph corresponding to three file - sharing communities : a high - energy physics collaboration ( section [ sec : d0 ] ) , the web as seen from the boeing traces ( section [ sec : www ] ) , and the kazaa peer - to - peer file - sharing system seen from a large isp in israel ( section [ sec : kazaa ] ) .",
    "this section gives a brief description of each community and its traces ( duration of each trace , number of users and files requested , etc . ) in addition , we present the file popularity and user activity distributions for each of these traces as these have a high impact on the characteristics of the data - sharing graph : intuitively , a user with high activity is likely to map onto a highly connected node in the data sharing graph .",
    "similarly , highly popular files are likely to produce dense clusters .",
    ".characteristics of traces analyzed . [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ table : newmans - model ]    table [ table : newmans - model ] leads to two observations .",
    "first , the actual clustering coefficient in the data - sharing graphs is always larger than predicted and the average degree is always smaller than predicted .",
    "an interesting new question emerges : what is the explanation for these ( sometimes significant ) differences ?",
    "one possible explanation is that user requests for files are not random : their preferences are limited to a set of files , which explains the actual average degree being smaller than predicted .",
    "a rigorous understanding of this problem is left for future work .",
    "a second observation is that we can perhaps compare the file sharing in the three communities by comparing their distance from the theoretical model .",
    "we see that the kazaa data - sharing graphs are the closest to the theoretical model and the d0 graphs are very different from their corresponding model .",
    "this is different from the comparison with the erds - rnyi random graphs ( table [ table : all ] ) .",
    "the cause of this difference and the significance of this observation remain to be studied in the future .",
    "event frequency has been shown to follow a zipf distribution in many systems , from word occurrences in english and in monkey - typing texts to city population .",
    "it is also present in two of the three cases we analyze : the web and kazaa .",
    "other patterns characteristic to data access systems include time locality , in which an item is more popular ( and possibly requested by multiple users ) during a limited interval and temporal user activity , meaning that users are not uniformly active during a period , but follow some patterns ( for example , downloading more music files during weekends or holidays @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we ask :    * _ are the patterns we identified in the data - sharing graph , especially the large clustering coefficient , an inherent consequence of these well - known behaviors ? _    to answer this question , we generate random traces that preserve the documented characteristics but break the user - request association . from these synthetic traces ,",
    "we build the resulting data - sharing graphs , and analyze and compare their properties with those resulting from the real traces .",
    "the core of our traces is a triplet of user i d , item requested and request time .",
    "figure [ fig : urt - relationship ] identifies the following correlations in traces , some of which we want to preserve in the synthetic traces :        1 .",
    "user  time : user s activity varies over time : for example , in the d0 traces , some users accessed data only in may .",
    "request  time : items may be more popular during some intervals : for example , news sites are more popular in the morning . 3 .   user  request",
    ": this is the key to user s preferences . by breaking this relationship and randomly recreating it",
    ", we can analyze the effect of user preferences on the properties of the data - sharing graph .",
    "4 .   user : the number of items requested per user over the entire interval studied may be relevant , as some users are more active than others ( see figures [ fig : web - reqs - per - user ] left for the web traces ) .",
    "time : the time of the day ( or in our case , of the periods studied ) is relevant , as the web traces show ( the peak in figure [ fig : web - reqs - per - user ] right ) .",
    "request : this is item popularity : number of requests for the same item .",
    "our aim is to break the relationship ( 3 ) , which implicitly requires the break of ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or both .",
    "we also want to preserve relationships ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) .",
    "one can picture the traces as a @xmath0 matrix , in which @xmath1 is the number of requests in that trace and the three columns correspond to users , files requested , and request times , respectively .",
    "now imagine the we shuffle the users column while the other two are kept unchanged : this breaks relations ( 3 ) and ( 1 ) . if the requests column is shuffled , relations ( 3 ) and ( 2 ) are broken .",
    "if both user and request columns are shuffled , then relations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) are broken . in all cases , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) , and ( 6 ) are maintained faithful to the real behavior : that is , users ask the same number of requests ( 4 ) ; the times when requests are sent are the same ( 5 ) ; and the same requests are asked and repeated the same number of times ( 6 ) .",
    "we generated synthetic traces in three ways , as presented above :    1 .",
    "no correlation related to time is maintained : break relations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 3 ) .",
    "2 .   maintain the request times as in the real traces : break relations ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "3 .   maintain the user s activity over time as in the real traces : break ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) .",
    "three characteristics of the synthetic data - sharing graphs are relevant to our study .",
    "first , the number of nodes in synthetic graphs is significantly different than in their corresponding real graphs ( `` corresponding '' in terms of similarity criterion and time ) .",
    "on the one hand , the synthetic data - sharing graphs for which user activity in time ( relation ( 1 ) ) is not preserved have a significantly larger number of nodes . even when the user activity in time is preserved ( as in the st3 case )",
    ", the number of nodes is larger : this is because in the real data - sharing graphs , we ignored the isolated nodes and in the synthetic graphs there are no isolated nodes . on the other hand , when the similarity criterion varies to a large number of common requests ( say , 100 in the d0 case , figure [ fig : d0-nnodes ] ) , the synthetic graphs are much smaller or even disappear .",
    "this behavior is explained by the distribution of weights in the synthetic graphs ( figure [ fig : synth - d0-wd ] ) : compared to the real graphs ( figure [ fig : d0-weightdistrib ] ) , there are many more edges with small weights .",
    "the median weight in the real d0 data - sharing graphs is 356 and the average is 657.9 , while for synthetic graphs the median is 137 ( 185 for st3 ) and the average is 13.8 ( 75.6 for st3 ) .",
    "second , the synthetic data - sharing graphs are always connected ( unlike real graphs , that always have multiple connected components , as shown in table [ table : all ] ) . even for similarity criteria with large number of common requests",
    "the synthetic graphs remain connected .",
    "this behavior is due to the uniform distribution of requests per user in the case of synthetic traces , which is obviously not true in the real case .",
    "third , the synthetic data - sharing graphs are `` less '' small worlds than their corresponding real graphs : the ratio between the clustering coefficients is smaller and the ratio between average path lengths is larger than in real data - sharing graph ( figure [ fig : synth - sw - d0 ] ) .",
    "however , these differences are not major : the synthetic data - sharing graphs would perhaps pass as small worlds .",
    "these results show that user preferences for files have significant influence on the data - sharing graphs : their properties are not induced ( solely ) by user - independent trace characteristics , but human nature has some impact .",
    "so perhaps the answer to this section title ( `` human nature or zipf s law ? '' ) is `` both '' .",
    "however , it seems that identifying small - world properties is not a sufficient metric to characterize the natural interest - based clustering of users : we might need a metric of how small world a small - world data - sharing graph is .",
    "this problem remains to be studied further in the future .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the structure we call the data - sharing graph can be applied at various levels and granularities in a computing system .",
    "we looked at relationships that form at the file access level , but intuitively similar patterns could be found at finer granularity , such as access to same memory locations or access to same items in a database .",
    "for example , a recent article @xcite investigates the correlation of program addresses that reference the same data and shows that these correlations can be used to eliminate load misses and partial hits .    at a higher level",
    ", the data - sharing graph can identify the structure of an organization  based on the applications its members use , for example  by identifying interest - based clusters of users and then use this information to optimize an organization s infrastructure , such as servers or network topology .",
    "in this section we focus on implications for mechanism design of the data - sharing graph from two perspective : its structure ( definition ) and its small - world properties .",
    "we stress that these are untested but promising ideas for future work .",
    "some recommender systems have a similar flavor to the data - sharing graph .",
    "referralweb @xcite attempts to uncover existing social networks to create a referral chain of named individuals .",
    "it does this by inferring social relationships from web pages , such as co - authorship , research groups and interests , co - participation in discussion panels , etc .",
    "this social network is then used to identify experts and to guide searches around them .",
    "sripanidkulchai et .",
    "al came close to the intuition of the data - sharing graph in their infocom 2003 article @xcite : they improve gnutella s flooding - based mechanism by inserting and exploiting interest - based shortcuts between peers .",
    "interest - based shortcuts connect a peer to peers who provided data in the past .",
    "this is slightly different from our case , where an edge in the data - sharing graph connects peers that requested the same data .",
    "however , the two graphs are likely to overlap significantly if peers store data of their own interest .",
    "our study distinguishes by its independence from any underlying infrastructure ( in this case , the distribution of data on peers and the location mechanism ) and gives a theoretical explanation of the performance improvements in @xcite .",
    "the data - sharing graph can be exploited for a variety of decentralized file management mechanisms in resource - sharing systems ( such as peer - to - peer or grids ) .    * in a writable file - sharing system , keeping track of which peers recently requested a file facilitates the efficient propagation of updates in a fully decentralized , self - organizing fashion ( a similar idea is explored in @xcite ) . * in large - scale , unreliable , dynamic peer - to - peer systems file replication may be used to insure data availability @xcite and transfer performance .",
    "the data - sharing graph may suggest where to place replicas closer to the nodes that access them .",
    "similarly , it may be useful for dynamic distributed storage : if files can not be stored entirely on a node , then they can be partitioned among the nodes that are interested in that file .",
    "* in a peer - to - peer computing scenario , the relationships between users who requested the same files can be exploited for job management . if nodes store and share recently downloaded files , they become good candidates for running jobs that take those files as input .",
    "this can be used for scheduling , migrating or replicating data - intensive jobs .",
    "the idea underlying the data - sharing graph was first presented in @xcite as a challenge to design a file - location mechanism that exploits the small - world characteristics of a file - sharing community .",
    "meanwhile we completed the design and evaluation of a mechanism that dynamically identifies interest - based clusters , disseminates location information in groups of interested users , and propagates requests among clusters @xcite .",
    "its strengths come from mirroring and adapting to changes in user s behavior .",
    "file insertion and deletion are low cost , which makes it a good candidate for scientific collaborations , where use of files leads to creation of new files .",
    "this article reveals a predominant pattern in diverse file - sharing communities , from scientific communities to the web and file - swapping peer - to - peer systems .",
    "this pattern is brought to light by a structure we propose and that we call `` data - sharing graph '' .",
    "this structure captures the relationships that form between users who are interested in the same files .",
    "we present properties of data - sharing graphs from three communities .",
    "these properties are relevant to and might inspire the design of a new style of mechanisms in peer - to - peer systems , mechanisms that take into account , adapt to , and exploit user s behavior .",
    "we also sketch some mechanisms that could benefit from the data - sharing graph and its small - world properties .",
