    "studies of their energy spectra and eigenfunctions , and their connections with quantum chaos have been very fruitful and exciting .",
    "one of the properties of the eigenfunctions of these billiards is the organisation of regions with positive and negative signs .",
    "these domains appear in rather complex forms @xcite ; their number displays a near - incomprehensible order if organised in increasing energy .",

    "the great interest in these systems emerges from the simplicity they seem to present , and their ubiquity in a large number of contexts .    the schrdinger equation for a particle inside a rectangular box satisfying dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions can be immediately solved .",
    "the eigenfunctions are the well - known product of two sine or cosine functions and the nodal domains make a checkerboard . for the right isosceles and the equilateral triangle billiards , which are non - separable , the solutions are respectively two and three terms , each a product of two sinusoidal functions . for the equilateral triangle",
    ", we discovered a difference equation satisfied by the number of nodal domains , @xmath5 @xcite , a discrete variable of the system . in this article , we show that @xmath5 for all the integrable billiards obey similar difference equations .",
    "this general result is amazing , in view of widely varied findings observed for these billiards about various statistical measures @xcite .",
    "interestingly , recent investigations of integrable lattice systems @xcite have also sought to probe the intricate connection between the theory of exactly integrable discrete systems and the formalism of difference equations .",

    "the subscript @xmath13 simply denotes the ordering of the spectrum such that @xmath14 .",
    "the importance of the nodal set arises from the fact that the sequence of the number of nodal domains of the eigenfunctions of the schrdinger equation not only bears significant geometric information about the system @xcite but also provides a new criterion for chaos in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "hence , it may be reasonable to conjecture that the difference equations also encode the geometry of the system itself .",

    "birkhoff conjectured that among all billiards inside smooth convex curves , ellipses are characterised by integrability of the billiard map @xcite .",
    "examples of systems that are both integrable and separable are presented by the rectangular , circular and elliptic billiards .",
    "separability arises from the observation that the corresponding schrdinger equations on @xmath11 are separable in certain coordinate systems @xcite .",

    "for neumann boundary conditions , the generalisation of the results presented herein is trivial for separable integrable systems , since the same difference equations and expressions for @xmath36 hold .",
