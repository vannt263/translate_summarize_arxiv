    "the requirement of higher integration scales in electronic circuits , the onset of nanosensory applications in biomedicine , but also the fascinating capabilities of modern experimental setup with its enormous potential in polymer and surface research recently led to an increasing interest at the hybrid interface of organic and inorganic matter  @xcite .",
    "this also includes numerous detailed studies , e.g. , of polymer film wetting phenomena  @xcite , pattern recognition  @xcite , protein  ligand binding and docking  @xcite , charged adsorbed polymers  @xcite as well as deposition and growth of polymers at surfaces  @xcite .    in most theoretical and computational studies",
    "the polymer is anchored at the substrate with one of its ends which reduces the entropic freedom of the polymer .",
    "these surface - grafted polymers  @xcite are , e.g. , of particular interest in studies of shape transformations  @xcite , e.g. , as reaction to external fields  @xcite . however , in many recent experiments of organic  inorganic interfaces the setup is different  @xcite and is more adequately described by a polymer moving in a cavity with one adsorbing surface  @xcite .",
    "the main difference of such nongrafted polymers considered in this work is of entropic kind : in the desorbed phase the polymer can move freely within the cavity , and the polymer can fold into conformations , where the ends have no contact with the surface .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ secmod ] we describe the details of a minimalistic model for the hybrid system .",
    "the main result , the solubility - temperature pseudo - phase diagram , is presented and discussed in sect .",
    "[ sechyb ] .",
    "the interpretation is consolidated by exemplified studies of fluctuations and correlations of relevant thermodynamic quantities such as numbers of contacts between monomers and monomer - substrate contacts as well as the gyration tensor , in the different phases .",
    "the contact numbers turn out to be adequate system parameters for the description of the macrostate of the system , and therefore the free energy in dependence of these contact numbers is subject of a detailed study in sect .",
    "[ secfree ] .",
    "this quantity is also useful for classifying the conformational transitions between the phases which are also discussed there .",
    "eventually , we conclude in sect .",
    "[ secsum ] with a summary of the main results .",
    "we employ a minimalistic simple - cubic ( sc ) lattice model  @xcite which allows a systematic analysis of the conformational phases experienced by a nongrafted polymer in a cavity with one adhesive surface .",
    "an example for the cavity model is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmod ] .",
    "the polymer can move between the two infinitely extended parallel planar walls , separated by a distance @xmath0 expressed in lattice units .",
    "the substrate is short - range attractive to the monomers of the polymer chain , while the influence of the other wall is purely steric .    denoting the number of nearest - neighbor , but nonadjacent monomer - monomer contacts by @xmath1 and the number of nearest - neighbor monomer - substrate contacts by @xmath2",
    ", the energy of the hybrid system can be expressed in the simplest model as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the respective contact energy scales , which are left open in the following . for simplicity , we perform a simple rescaling and set @xmath6 and @xmath7 . here",
    "we have introduced the overall energy scale @xmath8 and the dimensionless reciprocal solubility @xmath9 that controls the quality of the implicit solvent surrounding the polymer ( the larger the @xmath9 , the worse the solvent ) .",
    "since contacts with the substrate usually entail a reduction of monomer - monomer contacts , there are two competing forces ( rated against each other by the energy scales ) affecting the formation of intrinsic and surface contacts .",
    "in this paper we mainly focus on the conformational transitions the polymer experiences under different environmental conditions .",
    "concretely , we are interested in the dependence of energetic and structural quantities on temperature @xmath10 and reciprocal solubility @xmath9 in equilibrium .",
    "the probability ( per unit area ) for a conformation with @xmath2 surface and @xmath1 monomer - monomer contacts at temperature @xmath10 and reciprocal solubility @xmath9 is given by @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the contact density and @xmath13 the partition sum .",
    "in this decomposition , @xmath14 stands for the density of unbound conformations , whereas @xmath15 is the density of surface and intrinsic contacts of all conformations bound to the substrate . obviously , the number of the conformations without contact to the attractive substrate , @xmath14 , depends on the distance @xmath0 between the cavity walls . for a sufficiently large distance @xmath0 from the substrate",
    "the influence of the neutral surface on the unbound polymer is small . for @xmath16",
    ", however , @xmath14 formally diverges .",
    "therefore , the non - adhesive , impenetrable steric wall is necessary for regularization .",
    "we studied polymers with up to 200 monomers by applying the contact - density chain - growth algorithm which is an improved variant of the recently developed multicanonical chain - growth sampling method  @xcite .",
    "all these methods set up on a variant of the pruned - enriched variant  @xcite of rosenbluth sampling  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the improved method is that it directly samples the contact density @xmath17 , which is very useful for problems , where the model provides different energy scales .",
    "this generalizes the ordinary multicanonical version  @xcite which samples the density of states , i.e. , the number of states for given energy . here",
    "we can set the two independent energy scales @xmath5 and @xmath4 or their ratio @xmath9 , respectively , _",
    "after _ the simulation .",
    "this allows to introduce the reciprocal solubility @xmath9 as a second environmental parameter in addition to the temperature @xmath10 .",
    "the partition sum of the system as a function of these two parameters is simply @xmath18 and the statistical average of any function @xmath19 is given by the formula @xmath20 which is very convenient since it only requires to estimate the contact density @xmath17 in the simulation . denoting contact correlation matrix elements as @xmath21 with @xmath22",
    ", the specific heat can be written as @xmath23 all quantities depending only on the contact numbers @xmath1 and @xmath2 can therefore simply be calculated from the estimate of the contact density @xmath17 provided by our simulation method .",
    "although the two contact parameters are sufficient to describe the macrostate of the system and their fluctuations characterize the main pseudo - phase transition lines , it is often useful to introduce also nonenergetic quantities such as the end - to - end distance and the gyration tensor for gaining more detailed structural information of the polymer . for our specific problem at hand",
    "it is particularly useful to study the structural anisotropy of the adsorbed polymer in the different phases . to this end",
    ", we define the general gyration tensor for a polymer chain of @xmath24 beads with the components @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , is the @xmath28th cartesian coordinate of the @xmath29th monomer and @xmath30 is the center of mass with respect to the @xmath28th coordinate .",
    "anisotropy in the polymer fluctuations is connected with the system s geometry and therefore it will be sufficient to study the components of the gyration tensor parallel ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 components ) and perpendicular ( in @xmath33 direction ) to the planar walls , @xmath34\\ ] ] and @xmath35 the gyration radius is then simply the trace of the gyration tensor , @xmath36 .",
    "the calculation of statistical averages for quantities @xmath37 that are not necessarily functions of the contact numbers @xmath2 and @xmath1 can not be performed via eq .",
    "( [ eqav ] ) . in this case",
    "only the more general relation @xmath38 holds , where the sum runs over all polymer conformations @xmath39 . introducing the accumulated density @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the kronecker symbol , the expectation value can be expressed , however , in a form similar to eq .",
    "( [ eqav ] ) : @xmath42 the quantity @xmath43 can easily be measured in simulations with the contact density chain - growth algorithm . in the following we use natural units ,",
    "i.e. , we set @xmath44 .",
    "for our exemplified study of the hybrid system in equilibrium we chose a polymer with 179 monomers . since this is a prime number , the polymer is unable to form perfect cuboid conformations on the sc lattice , as it is , e.g. , the case for a 100-mer .",
    "@xcite there we found two low - temperature subphases dominated by the same @xmath45 cuboid . in one subphase it had 20 surface contacts , while in the other the cuboid was simply rotated , entailing 25 surface contacts",
    "this is a typical example , where the exact number of monomers in the linear chain is directly connected with the occurrence of such specific pseudo - phases which are not , of course , phases in the traditional view . nonetheless , the enormous progress in high - resolution experimental structure analyses and in the technological equipment for precise polymer deposition , as well as the natural finite length of classes of polymers ( e.g. , peptides and proteins ) , explain the growing interest in pseudo - phases and the conformational transitions between them . here",
    "we mainly focus on the expected thermodynamic phase transitions  @xcite and low - temperature higher - order layering pseudo - phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "the following results were obtained from contact - density chain - growth simulations of the 179-mer in a cavity with @xmath46 ( see fig .  [ figmod ] ) , choosing uniformly distributed starting points at random . in eight independent runs @xmath47 polymer conformations were generated in total .",
    "the resulting contact density @xmath17 and accumulated densities like @xmath43 are independent of external parameters such as temperature @xmath10 and reciprocal solubility @xmath9 .",
    "concrete values of statistical quantities for specific parameter settings are obtained by simple reweighting as in eqs .",
    "( [ eqprob ] ) and  ( [ eqavb ] ) .",
    "= 8.8 cm      discontinuities or divergences of energetic and nonenergetic fluctuations as functions of external parameters reveal typically dramatic cooperative transitions in the collective , macroscopic behavior of the system s microscopic degrees of freedom in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "these transitions separate then thermodynamically stable phases and the transitions can uniquely be identified by certain values of the external parameters , e.g. , the transition temperature . usually , all fluctuations collapse at the same parameter sets .",
    "but , this `` traditional view '' is only true in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "finite - size systems usually exhibit a zoo of crossover- or pseudo - transitions , most of which disappearing in the thermodynamic limit . in special cases , e.g. , proteins , where the specific amino acid sequence is of finite length , no phase transitions in the strict sense",
    "happen at all .",
    "still , peaks in curves of fluctuating quantities _ can be _",
    "signatures for `` cooperative activity '' , but this is not necessarily indicated by all fluctuations considered , and if , then typically at different parameter values .",
    "@xcite nonetheless , in protein science , pseudo - transitions such as conformational transitions are important in the understanding of secondary structure formation and the tertiary hydrophobic - core collapse . for polymers ,",
    "mainly the @xmath48 collapse transition , which is probably of second order , is of particular interest .",
    "@xcite this is a real thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "nonetheless , at least for finite systems , an additional first - order - like glassy or crystallization transition at lower temperatures is also conjectured for polymers .",
    "@xcite    all these peculiarities of finite polymer systems are also relevant for the adsorption problem we consider here . in fig .",
    "[ figpd ] we have plotted the projection of the specific heat profile onto the solubility - temperature plane as obtained from our simulation of the 179-mer in a cavity with @xmath46 .",
    "the color code reflects the value of the specific heat and the brighter the shading , the larger the value of @xmath49 .",
    "black and white lines emphasize the ridges of the profile .",
    "since we consider the specific heat as appropriate to identify pseudo - phases , these ridges mark the pseudo - phase boundaries .",
    "as expected , the pseudo - phase diagram is divided into two main parts , the phases of adsorption and desorption .",
    "the two desorbed pseudo - phases dc ( desorbed - compact conformations ) and de ( desorbed - expanded structures ) are separated by the collapse transition line which corresponds to the @xmath48 transition of the infinite - length polymer which is allowed to extend into the three spatial dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the region of the adsorbed pseudo - phases is much more complex , and little is known about its details , since it is relevant at lower temperatures , where conventional monte carlo methods with pivot - like updates usually tend to fail .",
    "the presence of general phases of adsorbed - expanded ( ae )  @xcite and adsorbed - compact ( ac1 , ac2 ) conformations was postulated in adsorption studies of grafted polymers and the existence of an additional phase of surface - attached globules ( ag )  @xcite was assumed  @xcite . in a recent study  @xcite , it was argued that the layering transition between ac1 and ac2 is a thermodynamic phase transition .",
    "although the polymer in our study is still relatively small , we can clearly identify pseudo - phases in fig .",
    "[ figpd ] which can be assigned these labels , too .",
    "those regions are separated by the black lines indicating the transitions between them .",
    "we expect that these are transitions in the thermodynamic meaning ; only the precise location of the transition lines will still change with increasing length of the polymer .",
    "thus , this picture confirms the previously assumed phases and it provides evidence that the ag phase is indeed there .",
    "furthermore , we have also highlighted by white lines transitions between pseudo - phases which will probably not survive in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this concerns , e.g. , the higher - order layering transitions among the compact pseudo - phases ac2a@xmath50-d . in the following sections we will analyse the properties of the pseudo - phases in more detail .",
    "the contact numbers @xmath2 and @xmath1 can be considered as system parameters appropriately describing the state of the system and are therefore useful to identify the pseudo - phases .",
    "peaks and dips in the external - parameter dependence of self - correlations @xmath51 , @xmath52 and cross - correlations @xmath53 indicate activity in the contact - number fluctuations and , analysing the expectation values @xmath54 and @xmath55 in these active regions of the external parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 , allow for an interpretation of the respective conformational transitions between the pseudo - phases .",
    "= 8.8 cm    in fig .",
    "[ figc179 ] , we have plotted for the 179-mer these quantities and , for comparison , the specific heat as functions of the temperature @xmath10 at a fixed solvent parameter @xmath56 .",
    "this example is quite illustrative as the system experiences several conformational transitions when increasing the temperature starting from @xmath57 ( see fig .",
    "[ figpd ] ) . at temperatures very close to @xmath57 ( pseudo - phase ac1 )",
    "all 179 monomers have contact to the substrate and 153 monomer - monomer contacts are formed .",
    "this is the most compact contact set being possible for _ topologically two - dimensional _ , film - like conformations .",
    "it should be noted , however , that approximately @xmath58 conformations ( self - avoiding walks ) belong to this contact set .",
    "@xcite this high degeneracy is an artefact of the minimalistic lattice polymer model used .",
    "it is remarkable that the conformations with the highest number of total contacts @xmath59 are film - like compact ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "all other conformations we found possess less contacts , even the most compact contact set that dominates the five - layer pseudo - phase ac2a@xmath61 ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 , i.e. , @xmath64 ) .",
    "the reason is that for low temperatures , those macrostates are formed which are energetically favored . entropy is not yet relevant  for the @xmath56 example @xmath54 drops to 149 only up to @xmath65 .",
    "increasing the temperature further , the situation dramatically changes , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figc179 ] . in a highly cooperative process , the average number of intrinsic contacts @xmath55 significantly increases ( to @xmath66 ) at the expense of surface contacts ( @xmath54 drops to approximately 104 ) .",
    "consequently , the strong fluctuations @xmath67 signalize a conformational transition , and the anticorrelation indicated by @xmath53 confirms that surface contacts turn into intrinsic contacts , which indirectly leads to the conclusion that the film - like structure is given up in favor of layered , spatially three - dimensional conformations .",
    "the system has entered subphase age which is the part of the phase ag , where two - layer conformations dominate .",
    "the subphase transition near @xmath68 from the two - layer ( age ) to the bulky regime of ag is due to the ongoing , rather unstructured expansion of the polymer into the @xmath33 direction by forming so - called surface - attached globules  @xcite .",
    "this is accompanied by a further reduction of surface contacts , while the number of intrinsic contacts changes weakly .",
    "approaching @xmath69 , the situation is just vice versa .",
    "intrinsic contacts dissolve and the system experiences a conformational phase transition from globular conformations in ag to random strands in ae . crossing this transition line , the system enters the good - solvent regime .",
    "eventually , close to @xmath70 , the polymer unbinds off the substrate .",
    "a clear signal is observed in the fluctuations of @xmath2 , i.e. , the number of average surface contacts rapidly decreases .",
    "the expanded polymer is `` free '' and the influence of _ both _ walls is effectively steric .",
    "this phase ( ae ) is closely related to the typical random - coil phase of entirely free and dissolved polymers in good solvent .",
    "this example shows that a study of the contact number fluctuations is indeed sufficient to qualitatively identify and describe the conformational transitions between the pseudo - phases of the hybrid system .",
    "for this reason , @xmath2 and @xmath1 are adequate system parameters playing a similar role as order parameters in thermodynamic phase transitions .",
    "one of the most interesting structural quantities in studies of polymer phase transitions is the gyration tensor  ( [ eqgyr ] ) . for our hybrid system",
    "we expect that the respective components parallel  ( [ eqgyrpara ] ) and perpendicular  ( [ eqgyrperp ] ) to the substrate will behave differently when the polymer passes pseudo - transition lines . in order to prove this anisotropy explicitly ,",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ figg179 ] the expectation values , @xmath71 , and the fluctuations of these two components , @xmath72 , again for the polymer in solvent with @xmath56 . for interpreting the peaks of the fluctuations",
    ", we have also included once more the specific heat curve for comparison .",
    "the immediate observation is that the temperatures , where one or both gyration tensor components exhibit peaks , almost perfectly coincide with those of the specific heat . this is a strong confirmation for the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ figpd ] which is based on the specific heat .",
    "obviously , even for the rather short polymer with 179 monomers , we encounter the onset of fluctuation collapse near the ( pseudo-)phase transitions .",
    "this is very promising for future quantitative finite - size scaling analyses .    at very low temperatures , i.e. , in pseudo - phase ac1",
    ", we have argued in the previous section that the polymer - conformation is the most compact single - layer film .",
    "this is confirmed by the behavior of @xmath73 and @xmath74 , the latter being zero in this phase .",
    "a simple argument that the structure is indeed maximally compact is as follows .",
    "it is well known that the most compact shape in the two - dimensional continuous space is the circle . for @xmath29 monomers residing in it , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the ( dimensionless ) radius of this circle .",
    "the usual squared gyration radius is @xmath77 and therefore @xmath78 for @xmath79 .",
    "indeed , this is close to the value @xmath80 of the ground - state conformation we identified in phase ac1 .",
    "note that the most compact shape in the simple lattice polymer model we used in our study is a square and not a discretized circle .",
    "@xcite    = 8.8 cm    near @xmath65 , the strong layering transition from ac1 to age is accompanied by an immediate decrease of @xmath73 , while @xmath74 rapidly increases from zero to about @xmath81 which is exactly the gyration radius ( perpendicular to the layers ) of a two - layer system , where both layers cover approximately the same area .",
    "note that the single layers are still compact , but not maximally . applying the same approximation as in eq .",
    "( [ eqcirc ] ) , the planar gyration radius for each of the two layers is now ( with @xmath82 ) @xmath83 , while we measured in this phase ( age ) @xmath84 .",
    "this separates the subphase age from the other two - layer pseudo - phase ac2d in fig .",
    "[ figpd ] , where the dominating conformation has perfect two - layer ( lattice ) structure with @xmath85 ( this is the same 2% difference between continuous and lattice calculation for perfect shapes as above ) .",
    "we will discuss the conformational peculiarities in the following in more detail . the subphase transition from age to ag near @xmath68",
    "is accompanied by a further decrease of @xmath73 whereas @xmath74 increases , i.e. , the height of the surface - adsorbed globule increases at the expense of the width .",
    "this tendency is stopped when approaching the transition ( @xmath69 ) from the globular regime ag to the phase of expanded , but still adsorbed conformations .",
    "while @xmath74 remains widely constant ( the fluctuation does not signalize any transition ) , the polymer strongly extends in the directions parallel to the substrate , as indicated by the peak of @xmath86 .",
    "after unbinding from the substrate , parallel and perpendicular gyration radii behave widely isotropically ( @xmath87 ) as the influence of the isotropy - disturbing walls is weak in this regime .",
    "it was shown in sect .",
    "[ ssecfl ] that the contact numbers @xmath2 and @xmath1 are unique system parameters for the pseudo - phase identification of the hybrid system .",
    "we define the restricted partition sum for a macrostate with @xmath2 surface contacts and @xmath1 monomer - monomer contacts by @xmath88 such that @xmath89 .",
    "assuming as usual that the dominating macrostate is given by the minimum of the free energy as a function of appropriate system parameters , it is useful to define the specific contact free energy as a function of the contact numbers @xmath2 and @xmath1 , @xmath90 identifying @xmath91 as a `` micro - contact '' entropy . for given external parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 , this relation can be used to determine the minimum of the contact free energy and therefore allows the identification of the dominant macrostate with respect to the contact numbers . in turn",
    ", this quantity allows for an alternative representation of the pseudo - phase diagram , complementary to the one shown in fig .  [ figpd ] in that it is related to the contact numbers @xmath2 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is done by determining for ( in principle ) all values of the external parameters @xmath10 and @xmath9 the minima of the contact free energy  ( [ eqrfreeb ] ) .",
    "then the pair of values @xmath2 and @xmath1 of the minimum contact free - energy state are marked in an @xmath2-@xmath1 phase diagram .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ figmap179 ] , where all free - energy minima of the 179-mer for the parameter set @xmath92 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] are included and , based on the arguments of the previous section , differently shaded according to the pseudo - phase they belong to .",
    "the nice thing of this representation is that it allows the differentiation of continuous and discontinuous pseudo - phase transitions .",
    "= 8.8 cm    the first important observation is that the diagram is divided into two separate regions , the pseudo - phases of desorbed conformations ( dc and de ) and the remaining different phases of adsorption .",
    "the `` space '' in between is blank , i.e. , none of these ( possible ) conformations was found to be a free - energy minimum conformation .",
    "this shows that transitions between the adsorbed and desorbed pseudo - phases are always first - order - like .",
    "it should be noted , that the regime of contact pairs @xmath94 lying _ above _ the shown compact phases is forbidden , i.e. , conformations with such contact numbers do not exist on the sc lattice .",
    "the second remarkable result is that the pseudo - phases dc , de , ae , and ag are `` bulky '' , while all ac subphases are highly localized in the plot of the free - energy minima . comparing with fig .",
    "[ figpd ] , the conclusion is that conformations in the ac phases are energetically favored ( more explicitly , for @xmath95 in ac1 and @xmath96 in the ac2 subphases ) , while the behavior in the other pseudo - phases is entropy - dominated : the number of conformations with similar contact numbers in the globular or expanded regime is higher than the rather exceptional conformations in the compact phases , i.e. , for sufficiently small @xmath97 ratios the entropic effect overcompensates the energetic contribution to the free energy .",

    "the discrete number and their separation leads to the conclusion that they have related structures . indeed , as can be seen in table  [ tabconf ] , where we have listed representative conformations for all pseudo - phases , the few conformations dominating these subphases exhibit compact layered structures . the most compact three - dimensional conformation with 263 monomer - monomer contacts and 36 surface contacts",
    "is favored in subphase ac2a@xmath61 and possesses five layers .",
    "starting from this subphase and increasing the temperature , two things may happen .",
    "a rather small change is accompanied with the transition to ac2a@xmath98 , where the number of intrinsic contacts is reduced but the global five - layer structure remains . on the other hand , passing the transition line towards ac2b , the monomers prefer to arrange in compact four - layer conformations . advancing towards ac2d ,",
    "the typical conformations reduce layer by layer in order to increase the number of surface contacts . in ac2d",

    "this is similar in subphase age , where also two - layer but less compact conformations dominate . in pseudo - phase ac1",
    "only the film - like surface layer remains .",
    "the reason for the differentiation of the phases ac1 and ac2 of layered conformations is that the transition from single- to double - layer conformations is expected to be a real phase transition , while the transitions between the higher - layer ac2 subphases are assumed to disappear in the thermodynamic limit .",

    "other noticeable phase transitions in the compact - globular adsorbed regime ( ac1-ac2d , ac1-age ) are the energetic layering transitions from film - like surface - layer to double - layer conformations which are also believed to survive the thermodynamic limit .",
    "@xcite in addition , further subphases of higher - order layers were found in low - temperature regions and bad solvent ( ac2a@xmath50 , ac2b , and ac2c ) .",
    "the most compact three - dimensional conformation found is cube - like and forms five layers ( in subphase ac2a@xmath61 ) .    the ( pseudo-)phase diagram is based on the specific - heat profile as a function of temperature and reciprocal solubility .",
    "although this profile allows for the identification of phases and their boundaries it does tell little about the conformational transitions between the phases . for this purpose we considered expectation values and fluctuations for the numbers of monomer - surface contacts , @xmath2 , and intrinsic monomer - monomer contacts , @xmath1 , separately .",
    "these contact numbers turned out to be sufficient to describe the macrostate of the system and therefore are useful to describe the conformations dominating the different phases .",
    "this view was completed by an exemplified study of the anisotropic behavior of the gyration tensor components of the polymer parallel and perpendicular to the substrate .",
    "another central aspect was the classification of the conformational transitions between the ( pseudo-)phases . based on the contact numbers @xmath2 and @xmath1 , we defined an appropriate free energy and studied the distribution of the minima in the @xmath2-@xmath1 space . from this kind of free - energy landscape",
    ", we found strong indications that the binding - unbinding transitions between the adsorbed and desorbed phases are first - order - like .",
    "this was also observed for the layering transitions . on the other hand ,",
    "the transitions across the line separating good and poor solvent , i.e. , between the compact ( or globular ) and the expanded conformations , are rather second - order - like .",
    "this is in coincidence with the known behavior of free polymers at the @xmath48 collapse transition in two and three dimensions .    since the experimental equipment and the technological capabilities",
    "have nowadays reached an enormous standard of high single - molecular resolution , we expect that it should be possible to verify experimentally not only the existence of the described thermodynamic phases , but also the pseudo - phases being only relevant for finite polymers and specific to their lengths .",
