    "the reconstruction of conductivity distributions in two or three dimensions from measurements of the current density - to - voltage map is known as electrical impedance tomography , or eit , and has applications in medical imaging , nondestructive testing , and geophysics . for the 3-d bounded domain considered here , medical applications include head imaging and the detection of breast tumors .",
    "see , for example , @xcite for a survey of clinical applications of eit . in this work",
    ", we consider a bounded domain in @xmath0 and present a direct reconstruction algorithm and its numerical implementation on the unit sphere .",
    "the theoretical foundation of the method dates back more than 20 years to a series of papers by sylvester - uhlmann @xcite , novikov @xcite , nachman - sylvester - uhlmann @xcite and nachman @xcite .",
    "the algorithm makes use of complex geometrical optics ( cgo ) solutions to the schrdinger equation and uses the inverse scattering method .",
    "this is described in detail in section 2 of this paper .",
    "the inverse conductivity problem was first formulated mathematically by caldern @xcite as follows .",
    "let @xmath1 be a simply connected , bounded domain with smooth boundary @xmath2 and let @xmath3 denote the conductivity distribution .",
    "assume there exists @xmath4 such that for @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the electric potential @xmath7 arising from the application of a known voltage to the boundary of @xmath8 is modeled by the generalized laplace equation with dirichlet boundary condition @xmath9 the dirichlet - to - neumann map @xmath10 is defined by @xmath11 thus @xmath10 represents static electrical boundary measurements : it maps an applied voltage distribution on the boundary to the resulting current flux through the boundary .",
    "caldern @xcite posed the question of whether the conductivity @xmath12 is uniquely determined by the dirichlet - to - neumann map , and if so , how to reconstruct the conductivity .",
    "he gave an affirmative answer to the uniqueness question for the linearized problem and gave a reconstruction algorithm for that case .",
    "his algorithm is described in section  [ sec : calderon ] of this paper .",
    "the uniqueness question for @xmath13 is still open in @xmath0 , but has been solved recently by astala and pivrinta @xcite for a bounded domain in @xmath14 , sharpening the previous results due to nachman @xcite in which @xmath15 , @xmath16 and brown and uhlmann @xcite in which @xmath17 , @xmath18 . in three dimensions",
    "the uniqueness problem was solved for smooth conductivities in @xcite . at the time of this publication , in @xmath0",
    "the uniqueness results with lowest regularity are @xcite with @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xcite with @xmath21 .",
    "most existing 3-d eit reconstruction algorithms are linear or iterative , minimizing a functional that describes the nearness of the predicted voltages to the measured data in a given norm with one or more regularization terms . in contrast , the algorithm presented here is direct and fully nonlinear .",
    "it is similar to the 2-d d - bar algorthims based on the works @xcite and @xcite , which were first implemented in @xcite . in these initial works the born approximation to the cgo solutions",
    "is used in the computation of the scattering transform .",
    "it was used successfully on experimental tank data in , for example , @xcite and human chest data in @xcite .",
    "this inspired the approach in section [ sec : texp ] of this paper in which the born approximation is used in the 3-d direct algorithm .",
    "for further reading on 2-d d - bar algorithms , the reader is referred to @xcite in which the application to discontinuous conductivity distributions is specifically addressed , and @xcite in which a rigorous regularization framework is established using the full scattering transform .",
    "caldern s method has also recently been used for the reconstruction from experimental data in both 2-d @xcite and 3-d @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we assume the conductivity @xmath22 we take @xmath8 to be the unit sphere in @xmath23 and assume @xmath24 near @xmath25 the smoothness assumption on @xmath12 is necessary , but the other assumptions are made mainly for simplicity in the numerical computations .",
    "we stress in particular that the theory is valid in more complex geometries .",
    "the study of the effects of noise in the data is not in the scope of this paper , but rather is left for future work .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section 2.2",
    "we describe a direct reconstruction algorithm with a linearizing assumption tantamount to a born approximation .",
    "that approach is referred to as the @xmath26 approach , consistent with the notation used in the 2-d d - bar algorithms .",
    "an explicit connection to the linearized method of caldern is established in section [ sec : calderon ] .",
    "the reconstruction of the conductivity in the 2-d d - bar method described in the works above is achieved by taking a small frequency limit in a d - bar equation for the cgo solutions to directly obtain @xmath27 .",
    "in contrast , here we have to take a high complex frequency limit .",
    "a d - bar equation for the 3-d problem is utilized in @xcite , resulting in a promising , but more complicated approach than the one studied here .",
    "the numerical implementation of that approach is left for future work . in section [ sec : spherical ] we consider the case of spherically symmetric conductivities and show symmetry properties in the scattering transform .",
    "we also show how the dirichlet - to - neumann map can be represented and approximated in that case .",
    "details on the numerical implementation are found in section [ sec : numerics ] .",

    "the reader is referred to @xcite for rigorous proofs .",
    "the equations closely parallel those of the 2-d problem ( note that @xcite precedes that work ) , and so readers familiar with that case will recognize the notation and functions involved .    the initial step is to transform the conductivity equation into a schrdinger equation .",

    "also @xmath310 is a fairly good reconstruction .",
    "a positive aspect in both reconstructions is that we get @xmath311 close to the boundary .",
    "moreover , the overall shape is also fairly well reconstructed .      when we reconstructed @xmath99 and @xmath100 we truncated the scattering data @xmath26 due to numerical instabilities .",
    "in this section we investigate the influence on the reconstructions of the truncation of the true scattering data @xmath312    figure [ fig : difftrunc ] shows @xmath85 and the reconstructions @xmath160 and @xmath313 for different truncations of @xmath85 , namely at @xmath314 for @xmath315 we have chosen @xmath316 with @xmath296 the actual potential and conductivity are almost identical to the curves corresponding to @xmath317 it is evident that the amount of truncation of the scattering transform influences the reconstruction , and that a very poorly reconstructed @xmath73 can still result in a good approximation of @xmath12 .",
    "this suggests that for the reconstruction of @xmath12 the values of the scattering data for small @xmath293 are very important .",
    "this is analogous to observations made in the 2-d case @xcite .",
    "so far we have used fixed values for @xmath319 and @xmath279 , which determine the support and the magnitude of @xmath318 .",
    "figure [ fig : gamexpdiffddiffa ] displays the reconstructions @xmath100 and @xmath310 of @xmath27 from @xmath300 for different choices of support @xmath319 and magnitude @xmath320 each row corresponds to a certain @xmath319-value and each column to a specific @xmath279-value . for small support and small magnitude",
    "we get good reconstructions , but the quality changes dramatically with larger amplitude and larger support .",
    "especially @xmath100 does not recover the actual conductivity very well for the large amplitude @xmath321",
    "in this work a direct method based on @xcite for reconstructing a 3-d conductivity distribution from the dirichlet - to - neumann map was implemented and tested on noise - free data .",
    "a linearizing approximation to the scattering transform , denoted @xmath26 was studied and compared to caldern s reconstruction algorithm .",
    "reconstructions of spherically symmetric conductivities in the unit sphere were computed using the @xmath26 approximation , caldern s method , and a scattering transform computed from the definition requiring knowledge of the actual schrdinger potential .",
    "the latter case served as a benchmark to study the quality of reconstructions for which the actual scattering transform is known .",
    "it was shown that very accurate reconstructions can be obtained from accurate knowledge of the scattering transform .",
    "it was found that in contrast to the 2-d case , the @xmath26 approximation is inaccurate near the origin , and this results in poor approximations to the magnitude of the conductivity .",
    "however , the support of @xmath322 and the boundary value @xmath94 was well approximated by all three methods .",
    "truncating the computed scattering transform in the computations was found to have a profound effect on the reconstructed schrdinger potential @xmath73 , but the affect on the reconstructed conductivity @xmath12 was less dramatic . in summary , it appears that the use of the full scattering transform in this method is a promising approach for 3-d reconstructions , while linearizations lead to significant inaccuracies in the reconstructed amplitudes .",
