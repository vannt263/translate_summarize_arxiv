    "recent experiments with ultracold atomic gases  @xcite have made it possible to study the time evolution of a tunable quantum many - body system that is kept in excellent isolation from the environment .",
    "for example , such a quantum system can be forced out of equilibrium by suddenly changing a parameter in the hamiltonian",
    ". then the system may or may not relax to a new steady state , which is not necessarily the thermal state predicted by statistical mechanics .",
    "after such a `` quantum quench '' the system evolves according to schrdinger s equation @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the prepared initial state and @xmath3 is the new hamiltonian for times @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "this situation has recently been studied by a variety of numerical and analytical techniques  @xcite .",
    "due to the unitary time evolution the wave function @xmath7 of an isolated system remains pure for all times and does not converge for @xmath4 @xmath8 @xmath9 . only the state of a finite subsystem , for which the rest of the system effectively acts as a reservoir , can become stationary  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , also for the entire system we expect _ relaxation _ of the expectation value @xmath10 of an observable @xmath11 to a stationary value for large times .",
    "however , this global relaxation can happen only for ( i )  sufficiently large systems , ( ii )  sufficiently simple observables , and ( iii ) sufficiently complicated hamiltonians , for the following reasons .",
    "first of all , ( i )  many degrees of freedom are needed , so that the thermodynamic limit may be taken , otherwise one expects finite recurrence times  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent example ) .",
    "furthermore , ( ii ) the expectation value of a complicated observable need not relax ; for example , the expectation value of @xmath11 @xmath12 @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 , involving the projectors onto two eigenstates of @xmath3 with different energies , oscillates for all times .",
    "usually such projectors are highly nonlocal and their expectation values correspond to correlation functions of very high order . on the other hand , local and few - particle observables are usually simple enough to relax to new stationary values .",
    "finally , ( iii ) the hamiltonian @xmath3 that governs the dynamics must also be sufficiently complicated .",
    "for example , the magnetization of an ising chain in a transverse magnetic field relaxes for long - range interactions , but keeps oscillating when only next neighbors are coupled  @xcite .",
    "similar `` collapse - and - revival '' oscillations of a many - body system were recently observed in experiments with ultracold atoms by greiner _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite . in their experiments ,",
    "a bose condensate was prepared in the potential of an optical lattice which was suddenly steepened  @xcite , then the bosons are essentially only subject to the hubbard interaction @xmath3 @xmath12 @xmath16 but no hopping between lattice sites occurs . since in this case @xmath17 has only integer eigenvalues , the wave function will oscillate for all times with period @xmath18 .    for small hopping between lattice sites it follows from perturbation theory that expectation values keep oscillating for short times .",
    "but it is not clear what will happen for long observation times .",
    "is relaxation possible for a bosonic or fermionic hubbard model if the spectrum has a mott gap , or if the initial state is a mott insulator ? or is it prevented by the mott gap in the energy spectrum ?",
    "the answer is no , not necessarily : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hubbardmodel ] we provide an example , the @xmath0 fermionic hubbard model  @xcite , which shows that relaxation in the presence of a mott gap is indeed possible . note that the formation of a fermionic mott insulator was recently observed with ultracold atoms  @xcite .",
    "another central question is whether the steady state of a quenched isolated system can be described by an effective density matrix  @xmath19 , such that @xmath20 $ ] yields the correct expectation value for any observable @xmath11 which relaxes .",
    "statistical mechanics can be used to make an approximate but usually accurate prediction @xmath21 for this steady - state density matrix .",
    "for example , the microcanonical prediction is that @xmath21 @xmath12 @xmath22 for states with energy close to @xmath23 , and zero otherwise .",
    "if @xmath24 $ ] indeed agrees with the long - time limit of @xmath10 , we say that the system _",
    "thermalizes_. clearly , thermalization can be expected only for sufficiently coarse - grained observables ; it is always possible to construct a complicated correlation function that depends on the details of the initial conditions and is not described by @xmath21 .",
    "as for classical gases , thermalization is generally expected for isolated interacting quantum systems .",
    "indeed , for one - dimensional atomic bose gases , the dynamics leading to the thermal state were recently observed by hofferberth _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "thermalization of an isolated system is impossible in certain cases , usually because the system is integrable in the sense that there are infinitely many constants of motion .",
    "simple theoretical examples are one - dimensional integrable models , such as the @xmath25 spin chain , for which the magnetization does not thermalize after a quench of the longitudinal magnetic field  @xcite , or the ising chain in a transverse field , whose correlation functions do not thermalize after a field quench  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the lack of thermalization was recently observed by kinoshita _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for bosonic atoms confined to one dimension , whose nonthermal stationary momentum distributions were attributed to integrability .",
    "the fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics is that the equilibrium state is characterized only by a few thermodynamic variables such as internal energy and particle number .",
    "however if the system is integrable , its infinitely many constants of motion lead to a rather detailed memory of the initial state , because much fewer states are accessible to the dynamics . nevertheless , even in the absence of thermalization",
    ", a statistical prediction for the steady state can be made with a _",
    "generalized gibbs ensemble  ( gge ) _ , as discussed in the recent work of rigol _ et al .",

    "the gge prediction for the steady - state expectation value of an observable @xmath11 is then @xmath35 @xmath12 @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "gges successfully predict some properties of the nonthermal steady states occurring after quenches in integrable or highly constrained systems .",
    "for example , they yield the correct nonthermal momentum distribution of one - dimensional hard - core bosons  @xcite ( experimentally realized in ref .  ) , for the one - dimensional tomonaga - luttinger model  @xcite , and for the falicov - kimball model in infinite dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the gge also yields the correct double occupation for the @xmath0 fermionic hubbard model , as shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : hubbardmodel ] below .",
    "however , in some cases , the stationary values of some observables differ from the statistical predictions of the gge .",
    "for one - dimensional hard - core bosons the unit - cell averaged one - particle correlation function is not described by the gge  @xcite .",
    "furthermore gangardt and pustilnik  @xcite pointed out that the gge  ( [ eq : gge ] ) may not capture correlations between the conserved quantities @xmath27 .",
    "as a consequence the merit of generalized gibbs ensembles is currently somewhat controversial . in this situation",
    "rather general criteria for the validity of gges should be useful , which we derive in sec .",
    "[ sec : gibbsensembles ] .",
    "our approach is complementary to the work of barthel and schollwck  @xcite , who recently showed that for finite subsystems the reduced density matrix converges to the gge under certain mathematical conditions on the initial state and hamiltonian .",
    "it should be noted that an important ambiguity lingers in the construction of the gge for the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : effh ] ) . while all the @xmath27 are conserved ,",
    "so are all their combinations , i.e. , all products of the form @xmath37 , @xmath38 ,   , leading to the question of whether all such products should also be included in the exponent of the density matrix  ( [ eq : gge ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : gibbsensembles ] we show that for observables and initial states which involve little or no correlation , it suffices to fix the constraints @xmath27 , as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gge ] ) , but not their products .",
    "we also provide an example for which different choices of the gge lead to different predictions .",
    "finally , we note that thermalization might also be prevented in nonintegrable systems due to many - body effects , e.g. , the presence of a mott gap .",
    "nonthermal steady states in nonintegrable systems were observed and argued for in recent numerical studies for finite one - dimensional soft - core bosons  @xcite and spinless fermions  @xcite .",
    "by contrast , thermalization was observed for hard - core bosons on a two - dimensional lattice  @xcite .",
    "fast relaxation to a nonthermal quasisteady state , so - called prethermalization  @xcite , was recently observed for the fermionic hubbard model in high dimensions  @xcite .",
    "further studies of relaxation in nonintegrable many - body systems are therefore desirable , but will not be the subject of this paper .",
    "our goals in the present paper are thus two - fold .",
    "( i ) on the one hand , we provide an explicit example of relaxation in a fermionic mott insulator : in sec .",
    "[ sec : hubbardmodel ] we obtain the exact time evolution of the one - dimensional fermionic hubbard model with @xmath0 hopping and repulsive interaction @xmath39  @xcite , starting from the metallic ground state at @xmath39 @xmath12 @xmath6 or the insulating ground state at @xmath39 @xmath12 @xmath9 .",
    "we find that the expectation value of the double occupation @xmath40 relaxes with algebraically damped oscillations to a new stationary value for all @xmath39 , i.e. , relaxation is not inhibited by the presence of a mott gap .",
    "the long - time limit @xmath41 @xmath12 @xmath42 differs from the thermal value , as expected for an integrable system , but is described by an appropriate gge .",

    "this assumption will be examined in detail at the end of this section . from eq .",

    "it is straightforward to obtain the long - time average  ( [ eq : obsaverage_diag ] ) and gge average  ( [ eq : gge ] ) of the observables @xmath189 and @xmath190 by using the occupation number basis @xmath176 and the fixed gge averages @xmath32 @xmath12 @xmath33 . in case  ( a ) we find    @xmath191    [ eq : aaverages ]    where we used the identity @xmath192 in the second line . in case",

    "furthermore we defined the permutation - averaged matrix elements @xmath197 @xmath12 @xmath198 @xmath199 @xmath200 and @xmath201 @xmath12 @xmath198 @xmath202 .    from these results",
    "we obtain rather general sufficient conditions for the validity of the gge predictions , namely the _ factorization of initial - state expectation values _ of  ( a ) products or  ( b ) polynomials of the constants of motion  @xmath27 as follows :      [ eq : factorizations ]    the @xmath187 and @xmath204 in ( [ eq : factorizationa ] ) and ( [ eq : factorizationb ] ) are those for which @xmath197 and @xmath205 , respectively , are nonzero .",
    "the criteria ( [ eq : factorizations ] ) are the central result of this section , and we now discuss their implications in detail .",
    "first we note that for simple observables , which involve at most one factor @xmath27 , the factorizations ( [ eq : factorizations ] ) occur trivially .",
    "this is the case , e.g. , for the double occupancy in the @xmath0 hubbard model , explaining why the gge  ( [ eq : grm_gge ] ) works in this case .",
    "typical observables of an _ interacting _ integrable system , however , are often rather complicated when expressed in terms of the constants of motion @xmath206 .",
    "thus all correlations between the constants of motion must vanish in the initial state in order for ( [ eq : factorizations ] ) to be fulfilled .",
    "this seemingly restrictive condition can nevertheless be met , because often the initial state is not strongly correlated in terms of the @xmath27 .",
    "moreover , some correlations among the @xmath27 are allowed provided that their contribution to the sum ( [ eq : aaverages ] ) or ( [ eq : baverages ] ) is negligible , e.g. , if it vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "for example , one - dimensional hard - core bosons are represented by a free - fermion hamiltonian . for an alternating potential ( as studied in refs .  )",
    "the initial state contains correlations only between the fermionic momentum number operators @xmath207 and @xmath208 .",
    "one can then show from ( [ eq : aaverages ] ) that the gge  ( [ eq : gge ] ) makes correct predictions , up to finite - size corrections , for observables that are restricted to a finite region of real space .",
    "another example is the fermionic luttinger model , which maps to a free - boson hamiltonian . for an interaction quench ( studied in ref .  )",
    "the initial state is a product state with correlations only between the bosonic momentum occupation @xmath209 and @xmath210 .    on the other hand ,",
    "correlations between constants of motion in the initial state , which remain for all times , can not be described by the gge  ( [ eq : gge ] ) , as noted in ref .  .",
    "however , in interacting integrable systems , such observables usually correspond to complicated many - particle operators in terms of the original microscopic degrees of freedom , and thus are not measurable in practice .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the microcanonical gibbs ensemble faces the same problem : one can always construct fine - grained observables that do not thermalize .",
    "can a gge be improved if it does not yield the correct long - time average ?",
    "the minimal necessary extension of the ensemble depends on the observable in question , but as one sees from eq .",
    "( [ eq : factorizations ] ) , it always suffices to fix not only the expectation values of the constants of motion @xmath27 but also the expectation values of _ all of their products _ ,",
    "i.e. , by using @xmath211 where the lagrange multipliers are chosen to fix _ all _ products , @xmath212 $ ] @xmath12 @xmath213 $ ]",
    ". then it follows immediately that @xmath214 $ ] @xmath12 @xmath215 and @xmath216 $ ] @xmath12 @xmath217 for the observables considered above .",
    "thus _ any steady state can be described by a sufficiently extended gge _ ,",
    "i.e. , by fixing sufficiently many products of constants of motion .    while fixing all products as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhotilde ] ) yields the exact long - time average , this extension of the gge can hardly be regarded as a statistical description of the steady state ( as noted in the previous subsection for the diagonal ensemble ) , because it uses almost the full information about the initial state .",
    "in fact , any nondegenerate hamiltonian @xmath3 acting on a hilbert space of dimension @xmath218 has @xmath219 pairwise commuting and linearly independent constants of motion  @xcite ; fixing all of them in a gge recovers the diagonal ensemble  @xcite .",
    "for a nonintegrable system one can choose , e.g. , the projectors onto the eigenstates of @xmath3  @xcite , or linearly independent integer powers of @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "in practice , however , these extensions of the gge are as hard to calculate as the long - time average .      in the previous subsection we assumed that the degeneracy of energy levels is irrelevant [ as defined above eq .",
    "( [ eq : obsaverage_diag ] ) ] , which allowed us to move from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : obsaverage]-[eq : rho_diag_def ] ) to  ( [ eq : obsaverage_diag ] ) .",
    "below we provide an example for which this assumption does not hold . in that case the expression  ( [ eq : obsaverage_diag ] ) for the long - time average can not be used , and thus neither  ( [ eq : atimeaverage ] ) nor  ( [ eq : btimeaverage ] ) are available .",
    "we consider a quench to @xmath39 @xmath12 @xmath6 in a general fermionic hubbard model .",
    "fermions ( with spin @xmath220 @xmath12 @xmath221 ) on a bravais lattice ( with @xmath56 lattice sites ) are prepared in a correlated unpolarized initial state @xmath146 with fixed densities @xmath222 @xmath12 @xmath223 @xmath12 @xmath224 the time evolution is governed by the free hamiltonian @xmath225 where @xmath226 labels the crystal momentum ( we suppress the vector notation ) ; periodic boundary conditions are assumed for simplicity .",
    "this hamiltonian of the form  ( [ eq : effh ] ) , with the number operators @xmath227 @xmath12 @xmath228 playing the role of the constants of motion @xmath27 .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state expectation value of the double occupation @xmath229 .    assuming again that the degeneracy of energy levels is irrelevant",
    ", we obtain for the long - time average  ( [ eq : obsaverage_diag ] ) , using the basis @xmath176",
    "@xmath12 @xmath230 , @xmath231      =      n_{\\uparrow}n_{\\downarrow }      =      \\frac{n^2}{4 }      \\,.\\label{eq : zeroquench_timeaverage }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the same value is obtained from the canonical and grand - canonical ensemble , and also from the generalized gibbs ensemble which uses the number operators @xmath227 as constants of motion : @xmath232 thus we conclude that _ the double occupation thermalizes to the value @xmath108 after a quench to @xmath39 @xmath12 @xmath6 in any hubbard model _ , provided that the degeneracy of energy levels is indeed irrelevant .",
    "interestingly , this statement disagrees with our exact results for the @xmath0 hubbard chain from sec .",
    "[ sec : hubbardmodel ] : when quenching from @xmath39 @xmath12 @xmath9 to @xmath6 we obtained the long - time limit as @xmath41 @xmath12 @xmath233  [ eq .  ( [ eq : dinfty_results ] ) ] .",
    "this differs from the long - time average  ( [ eq : zeroquench_timeaverage ] ) because the degeneracy of energy levels is in fact relevant for this quench : the initial - state density matrix does not factorize in the free - fermion basis and the linear dispersion @xmath234 @xmath12 @xmath235 leads to a massive degeneracy for the free - fermion energy eigenstates @xmath176 .",
    "therefore the long - time limit is not given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : obsaverage_diag ] ) and does not equal @xmath108 .",
    "furthermore this example shows that gges based on different representations of the constants of motion can yield different results .",
    "the free - fermion gge  ( [ eq : zeroquench_gge ] ) predicts the wrong value @xmath108 , whereas the gge  ( [ eq : grm_gge ] ) which uses the effective bosonic representation gives the correct value @xmath233 .",
    "in fact the choice of constants of motion for the construction of a gge  ( [ eq : gge ] ) is always ambiguous , as discussed in the introduction .",
    "nevertheless it is possible to determine the correct gge _ a priori _ ,",
    "i.e. , without knowing the real - time dynamics , by verifying that the degeneracy of energy levels is irrelevant and that the conditions  ( [ eq : factorizations ] ) are fulfilled .",
    "the exact real - time dynamics of the double occupation in the fermionic @xmath0 hubbard chain shows that the presence of a mott gap does not inhibit the relaxation after an interaction quench .",
    "its steady - state properties are correctly predicted by generalized gibbs ensembles .",
    "furthermore we showed for a general class of integrable quantum systems that the gge prediction equals the long - time average , provided that the observables or initial states are sufficiently uncorrelated in terms of the constants of motion .",
