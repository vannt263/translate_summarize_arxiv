    "a peculiar transport memory effect has been observed in many hopping insulators  @xcite : shifting the system either from the equilibrium or from its steady transport state produced by , e.g. , a sudden change of the gate voltage , @xmath0 , increases the conductance @xmath1 of the system , the effect not depending on the sign of the change .",
    "the @xmath2 dependence shows a characteristic memory cusp ( see ref .   for experimental details and a review ) which may persist for a long time .",
    "explanations of this appealing observation can be grouped into two major classes which are often referred to as _",
    "intrinsic _ and _ extrinsic _ mechanisms .",
    "the former one attributes memory effects to slow dynamics of strongly correlated electrons subject to quenched disorder and thus forming a _ coulomb glass _  @xcite .",
    "the connection between the features of a glassy phase and the formation of a coulomb gap was revealed in ref .  , suggesting that within the locator approximation the correlated electronic system maps to the sherrington - kirkpatrick spin glass .",
    "a direct relation between the long range electron correlations and the formation of the exponential distribution of deep electron states which is characteristic to glassy systems was also demonstrated in ref . .",
    "in a coulomb glass , memory effects reflect delayed formation of the coulomb gap in the efros - shklovskii ( es ) regime of the variable range hopping ( vrh).@xcite recently we have demonstrated how `` slow '' many - electron fluctuators can be formed in a coulomb system and analyzed their influence on the @xmath3 noise.@xcite such fluctuators can also lead to slow relaxation and memory effects .",
    "an extrinsic scenario assumes that electronic memory effects are caused by slowly relaxing _ atomic _ configurations influencing conducting channels and was first proposed in ref .",
    "to explain the @xmath4-cusp in granular au films .",
    "a possibility that polaron effects may be responsible for slow relaxation in hopping conductors was also discussed in refs . .",
    "the coulomb glass is formed well below the temperature @xmath5 entering the es law for the vrh as @xmath6 experiment  @xcite has shown that in this regime the @xmath3 noise intensity is strongly correlated with @xmath7 proving electronic nature of the low - frequency noise .",
    "however , the conductance memory cusps and their relaxation ( ageing ) where observed in the systems which do not exhibit es behavior , but are apparently subject to structural disorder  @xcite .",
    "various memory effects were observed in metallic granular structures  @xcite , which also possess a high degree of structural disorder .",
    "this calls for careful examining , whether the memory effects and the  two - cusps \" @xmath4-dependence  @xcite can be explained as a result of slow relaxation in the structurally disordered atomic matrix .    in this letter",
    "we present a model that may serve as a step toward a quantitative description of memory cusps based on an extrinsic mechanism .",
    "we show that due to slow relaxation of atomic structure , polaron clouds , which form near the hopping sites , suppress the bare electron density of states ( dos ) .",
    "changing gate voltage shifts chemical potential , removes the polaron screening , and , thus , increases the hopping conductivity .",
    "as the atomic structure adjusts itself with time to the new position of chemical potential , the conductivity relaxes to its quasi - stationary magnitude .",
    "atomic structural relaxation is described by two level systems ( tls).@xcite the tls model successfully describes thermodynamics and kinetics of amorphous solids at low temperature .",
    "it suggests that there exist atoms or groups of atoms undergoing tunneling motion and characterized by the broad universal distribution of their parameters . since all materials where",
    "the memory effects in conductivity were observed are strongly disordered one would expect that two level systems ( tls ) should exist there similarly to other glasses and disordered materials.@xcite these two - level systems interact with conducting electrons because they possess the dipole moment . in this manuscript",
    "we examine the effect of electron - tls interaction on the non - equilibrium conductivity .",
    "we show that this interaction results in the non - equilibrium behavior of conductivity which is qualitatively equivalent to the experimental observations , i. e. increase in conductivity after gate voltage application with its subsequent logarithmic relaxation to the equilibrium value .",
    "this theory uses the previous work,@xcite where the similar non - equilibrium behavior of the dielectric constant in amorphous solids@xcite has been explained using the tls interaction . since tls parameters are quite universal from material to material@xcite we can use these parameters for quantitative estimates which show that our theoretical predictions are consistent with existing experimental data .",
    "the paper is organized as following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : elelint ] we accurately define the conditions where our consideration is applicable , i. e. electron - electron interaction can be neglected , while electron - tls interaction is significant . in sec .",
    "[ sec : noneqdos ] the non - equilibrium behavior of electron density of states caused by their interaction with tls is derived . in sec .",
    "[ sec : noneqcond ] the non - equilibrium behavior of conductivity is described and compared with the experimental data .",
    "the results of the manuscript are summarized in conclusive sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "in this manuscript we ignore the effect of electron - electron interaction on the non - equilibrium behavior of conductivity .",
    "this is possible only under specific conditions when the electronic interaction is weak compared to their characteristic energies and there is no slow relaxation within the electronic subsystem . according to various considerations @xcite the slow relaxation in electronic subsystem",
    "can take place only below some critical temperature @xmath8 which is defined as the electronic glass transition temperature in ref . .",
    "this transition temperature is defined by the coulomb gap energy @xmath9 below we set @xmath10 .",
    "the coulomb gap depends on the electronic density of states @xmath11 , dielectric constant @xmath12 , system dimension @xmath13and electron localization radius @xmath14 .",
    "we believe that the dimensionless parameter @xmath15 is small , i. e. @xmath16 where the characteristic temperature @xmath5 in the efros - shlovskii hopping conductivity eq .",
    "( [ eq : es ] ) is given by @xmath17 then the coulomb gap is defined as @xmath18 if temperature exceeds the coulomb gap energy then electronic relaxation is fast .",
    "it is also useful to notice that for the electronic excitations with typical energy @xmath19 their characteristic interaction @xmath20 is smaller than the energy @xmath19 until @xmath21 and the condition @xmath22 serves as the definition of the coulomb gap .",
    "so when @xmath23 the interaction of representative excitations with energy @xmath24 is less than their energy so it can be treated as weak .",
    "if the system is near metal dielectric transition@xcite and the electron localization radius is large , then one can possibly have the opposite limit @xmath25 , this is the case which takes place in silicon mosfets investigated in ref . . under those conditions",
    "the only efros - shklovskii variable range hopping law eq .",
    "( [ eq : es ] ) is observed .",
    "we believe this is not the case for the systems of interest,@xcite where the different conductivity behavior is observed more close to the mott s variable - range hopping law , which suggests @xmath26.@xcite    therefore it is not possible to interpret the memory effects in conductivity at @xmath27 without the involvement of electronic interaction with the extrinsic slowly relaxing defects like tls . our theoretical study is restricted to this `` high temperature '' situation . since the temperature @xmath5 can change within the range of @xmath28k @xcite our assumption that the experimental temperature @xmath29k exceeds the coulomb gap energy eq .",
    "( [ eq : coulgap ] ) does not conflict with the common sense .",
    "we believe that at least some of experiments @xcite are performed in this temperature range .",
    "unfortunately , existing experimental data do not permit us to answer the question whether experimental temperature is above or below the coulomb gap .",
    "although the absence of the efros - shklovskii conductivity temperature dependence eq .",
    "( [ eq : es ] ) @xcite agrees with our assumption that the electronic interaction is not important this does not prove the absence of coulomb gap and electronic glassy state.@xcite .",
    "we therefore suggest additional experiments which can help to investigate the coulomb gap in the system which is the necessary prerequisite of the coulomb glass state .",
    "such experiment can be made for instance using scanning tunneling microscopy.@xcite if the coulomb gap in the density of electronic states will not be observed at experimental temperatures then one should expect that the extrinsic mechanism is in charge for the memory behavior in conductivity .",
    "our consideration is based on the concept of ` two level systems ' ( tls )  @xcite taking as its central hypothesis the assumption that in a system with quenched disorder a certain number of atoms ( or groups of atoms ) can occupy one of ( at least ) two equilibrium positions .",
    "these atoms therefore move in a double - well potential created by their environment and characterized by the asymmetry energy ( difference in energy minima ) and by the height and the width of separating barrier .",
    "the atoms comprising the tls change their configuration either by tunneling through- or by thermally activated hopping over the barrier .",
    "randomness in the heights and widths of the tls barriers gives rise to exponentially broad distribution of structural relaxation times .    .",
    "[ fig : polaron ] , width=302 ]    a localized electric charge polarizes the neighboring tlss , which thus acquire the electric dipole moment , @xmath30 , and screen the original bare charge , see fig .",
    "[ fig : polaron]a .",
    "the interaction energy of tls with the localized charge is estimated as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the vector connecting the center of this tls with the position of localized electron state , @xmath14 is the localization length , and @xmath12 is the material dielectric constant .",
    "polarized tlss form a polaron cloud around the localized electron and create a polaron gap for electronic excitations , implying that the states with the single - electron energy @xmath33 can not be excited any more .    in what follows",
    "we will find the correction to the electronic dos , @xmath34 , due to electron - tls interactions in the lowest approximation in the tlss density . to this end",
    "we first determine the change in dos due to a single neighboring tls characterized by the given energy splitting , @xmath19 , and the relaxation time , @xmath35 .",
    "the target correction to the electron dos is then obtained by averaging of the single tls contribution with respect to all possible neighboring tls positions and @xmath19 and @xmath35 .",
    "consider the correction to the density of electronic states with some energy @xmath36 caused by electron - tls interaction .",
    "since the concentration of tls is small we can assume that only one most closely located two - level system is important , while the probability that two tls are significant is much smaller than unity .",
    "then we consider electron interacting with the single tls using the standard hamiltonian @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the electron population operator , the spin @xmath39 @xmath40-projection operator @xmath41 describes two states of the tls , @xmath42 is the electronic energy in some localized state , @xmath43 is the energy of the two level system and @xmath44 is the charge - dipole interaction of the electron with the tls . in the thermal equilibrium",
    "the electron excitation energy @xmath45 can take values @xmath46 with the probabilities defined by the equilibrium boltzmann factors    @xmath47    respectively .",
    "the time - dependent correction to the density of states taken at the certain time @xmath48 can be associated only with those two level systems which have the relaxation time @xmath35 longer than the time of the experiment @xmath48 .",
    "that time must also have upper restriction by some maximum tls relaxation time @xmath49 which serves as the upper cutoff in the tls logarithmically uniform distribution over their relaxation times @xmath50 . within",
    "the logarithmic accuracy one can account for the above constraints introducing integrated time dependent tls density as @xmath51 this expression clearly demonstrates the nature of logarithmic time dependence of tls contribution to the electronic of states similarly to previous work @xcite .    the correction to the density of states of the particular electron with energy @xmath36 caused by its interaction with neighboring tlss can be expressed as    @xmath52    where the sum is taken over all pairs made of an electron @xmath53 and a tls @xmath54 characterized by energies @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively , @xmath57 is their interaction and @xmath58 is the system volume .",
    "probabilities @xmath59 are defined using eq .",
    "( [ eq : probplmin ] ) with the substitution @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dostls_correction ] ) can be replaced with the integration over electron and tls energies and the distance @xmath63 between electron and tls .",
    "this yields    @xmath64    where @xmath11 is the electronic density of states at energy @xmath36 taken in the absence of interaction with tls and @xmath13 is the system dimension .",
    "remember that @xmath65 is the dipole charge interaction between electron and tls possessing the dipole moment @xmath66 and averaging is performed with respect to random directions of a tls dipole moment .",
    "after integration over electronic energy @xmath42 and tls energy @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dostls_correction_simpl ] ) we obtained @xmath67 the most important electrons are those contributing to the hopping conductivity .",
    "these electrons have energy @xmath36 of order of the hopping energy @xmath68 which always exceeds the thermal energy . therefore assuming @xmath69 one can approximate the logarithm under the integral in leading order in @xmath70 as @xmath71 .",
    "the final expression for the correction is similar to the one used in earlier works @xcite for the coulomb gap and the dipole gap in the density of tls states .",
    "however our derivation of the correction is more general because our expression eq .",
    "( [ eq : dostls_correction_step2 ] ) can be used at arbitrarily temperature while the earlier derivation is valid only in the low temperature limit .",
    "finally the correction to electronic density of states can be expressed as @xmath72\\ , \\theta[u({\\mathbf{r}})-\\varepsilon]\\nonumber\\\\ & \\approx &    - \\frac{8\\pi}{3 } \\left(\\frac{e\\bar\\mu}{\\kappa}\\right)^{3/2 } \\frac{g_0p_0}{\\sqrt\\varepsilon } \\ln\\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{{\\text{m}}}}\\right)\\ , , \\label{eq : ans3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the typical dipole moment of a tls and @xmath74 is some characteristic minimum time associated with the gate voltage application .",
    "only the electrons with the energy @xmath75 influence the hopping conductance .",
    "we believe that at @xmath76k eq .",
    "( [ eq : ans3 ] ) is still applicable .",
    "equation ( [ eq : ans3 ] ) can be used to interpret the experimental data only if all relevant tlss were initially out of equilibrium . in other words ,",
    "all electrons contributing to hopping must be surrounded by non - equilibrium tlss .",
    "the equilibrium can be broken due to the application of the gate voltage .",
    "this can be realized when all electrons contributing to hopping are `` newcomers '' , i.e. , they are brought to the vicinity of the fermi level by application of the gate voltage , @xmath77 . for",
    "that the shift of the fermi energy by the gate voltage must exceed the hopping energy @xmath68 .",
    "then those electrons break the equilibrium in their neighboring tls randomly changing their energies by the scale of their interaction with those tls .",
    "all relevant tls with the energy of order of @xmath78 coupled to entering electrons ( or holes ) by the interaction having the same order of magnitude experience the jump in their energy induced by entering electrons .",
    "this moves them all out of equilibrium .",
    "their relaxation leads to the polaron shift of electron energy out of the fermi energy thus reducing the conductivity .",
    "thus the condition @xmath79 defines the width of the cusp in the non - equilibrium conductivity as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "one can show using ref .   that at those conditions the shift of tls energy induced `` directly '' by the gate voltage",
    "is still smaller than @xmath78 because of the small tls dipole moment @xmath80 erg@xmath81@xmath82 @xcite .",
    "we can compare this estimate with the experiment extracting @xmath78 from the expression for the conductivity , @xmath83 .",
    "let us put @xmath84 equal to the minimal metallic conductivity ( @xmath85 ohm@xmath86 ) and use available experimental results of ref .",
    "for the representative sample with resistance of @xmath87 mohm at @xmath88 k. the assumption about @xmath89 is justified by the experimental observations ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "then the hopping energy is @xmath90 ev .",
    "this value agrees qualitatively with the shift of the fermi energy @xmath91 mev associated with the value of the gate voltage @xmath77 at which the memory cusp is affected as was estimated earlier in ref .  .",
    "thus the suggested mechanism agrees with the experimental observations .",
    "the correction to the conductivity can be estimated as @xmath92_{\\varepsilon=\\varepsilon_h}$ ] . in this way",
    "we get @xmath93^{1/2 }    \\ln \\left(\\frac{t}{\\tau_{{\\text{m}}}}\\right )    \\ln\\frac{\\sigma_0}{\\sigma(t)}.\\ ] ] the time - dependent factor @xmath94 contains the measurement time as @xmath48 and the inverse sweep rate , @xmath95 , and affects only the amplitude of the peak , but not its shape . here",
    "@xmath96 is the characteristic time of the variable range hopping and the preexponential factor @xmath97 is of order of @xmath98ps at experimental temperatures .",
    "this can explain the experimentally observed independence of the dip shape on the sweep rate  @xcite .",
    "similar considerations apply to the es vrh with the proper renormalization of the hopping parameters . now",
    "the typical energy scale optimizing the hopping rate is @xmath99 , where @xmath100 , @xmath101 , and @xmath102 is a numerical factor  @xcite .",
    "let us now discuss the available experimental data in light of the above theory . according to our previous estimates , @xmath103 ev . the typical dipole moment",
    "can be estimated as @xmath104 erg@xmath81@xmath82 , which is close to typical dipole moments of tlss in glasses @xcite .",
    "we are not aware of independent measurements of the tls density , @xmath105 , in the materials under consideration . in principle",
    ", this quantity can be determined , e.g. , by measurement of the low frequency dielectric constant at @xmath106  k , where it should depend on the temperature logarithmically , the slope of the logarithmic dependence being @xmath107 .",
    "this dimensionless quantity turns out to be almost the same , @xmath108 , in many materials with strong quenched disorder , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "apparent universality of this quantity in such materials was attributed to the interaction between tlss  @xcite . assuming that the material studied in @xcite belongs to the same  universality class \" as the materials with strong quenched disorder we estimate @xmath105 as @xmath109 erg@xmath86@xmath110 , as in the most oxide glasses  @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath111 following ref .  .",
    "now we can check our assumptions regarding 3d arrangement of tlss forming the polarons and regarding lowest approximation in the tls density . estimating the polaron radius , @xmath112 , as as the length at which the electron - tls interaction , @xmath113 is comparable with the typical electron energy @xmath68 we get @xmath114 nm that is much less than the sample thickness @xmath115 .",
    "the average number of the tls forming polarons , i.e. , located within the polaron radius and having @xmath116 , @xmath117 turns out to be @xmath118 , i.e. , much less than @xmath98 .",
    "thus the lowest approximation in the tls density is valid .    using the above estimates and eq .",
    "( [ g ] ) we get @xmath119 .",
    "thus we predict the logarithmic relaxation rate of conductivity @xmath120 . according to the experimental data",
    "@xcite at @xmath88k and for the sample thickness equal to @xmath121 nm the conductivity changes by about @xmath122 during two decades in time so we can estimate it as @xmath123 .",
    "thus our theory agrees with experimental data reasonably well .",
    "we have presented a simple model of slow dynamics of hopping conductance in structurally disordered hopping insulators .",
    "it takes into account rearrangements of the dynamic structural defects , tlss , leading to formation of polarons close to the electron hopping states .",
    "the model qualitatively explains both the logarithmic relaxation and memory effects , and provides quantitatively reasonable estimates of the time - dependent non - equilibrium change in conductivity , @xmath124 ( see , e.g. , @xcite , fig .",
    "the dependencies of this quantity on different parameters  electron concentration , controlled by the gate voltage ; magnetic field ,  @xcite , and various protocols of breaking down the system equilibrium  are encoded in the logarithmic factors @xmath125 and @xmath126 while the temperature dependence enters as a power law through the energy @xmath127 : @xmath128 .",
    "that leads to the main temperature dependence @xmath129 and @xmath130 for the mott and es vrh , respectively .",
    "thus our theory explains the fast increase of the non - equilibrium raise of conductivity with decreasing the temperature .",
    "the following note is in order .",
    "we demonstrated that  slow \" excitations induced by structural disorder can indeed be responsible for the double - dip memory effect in hopping semiconductors in analogy to those in glasses  @xcite .",
    "the effect we considered is due to polarons formed by the structural excitations .",
    "yet , one should bear in mind that a similar polaron effect appears in pure electronic models .",
    "in particular , the polarons formed from pair excitations were considered in @xcite . in its turn ,  electronic polarons \" can be formed from slow relaxing electronic `` aggregates '' discussed in ref . .",
    "the presence of structural tls in ino films is indirectly supported by the fact that the low - frequency noise in these materials does not increase significantly under the disorder - driven metal - to - insulator transition.@xcite    further experimental verification is necessary to decide whether the non - equilibrium behavior is associated with the extrinsic or intrinsic model . a regular approach to attain this goal",
    "should be based on techniques affecting differently the structural and electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "one of the possibilities is measurement of the ac linear response such as simultaneous measurements of the attenuation and velocity of the acoustic waves in transverse magnetic field .",
    "the expected effect is caused by transitions in structural two - well configurations , while the electronic transitions are strongly suppressed by the magnetic field @xcite .",
