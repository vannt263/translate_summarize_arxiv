    "a sharp disagreement and refutation has been published recently grassberger1 on the contention , based on many studies @xcite - @xcite , that the generalized statistical - mechanical scheme known as nonextensive statistical mechanics @xcite is pertinent to the dynamical properties at the so - called onset of chaos in dissipative low - dimensional iterated maps .",
    "the ` dialogue ' between advocates and opponents of the appropriateness of this new formalism , here referred to as @xmath1-statistics , to this old problem has been hampered by the lack of both : i ) an all - inclusive explanation of how and why the new formalism relates to the aforementioned dynamics , and ii ) an objective appraisal of the published results on the subject as they have developed in time and in depth . whereas a definite rationalization may be hastened by the ongoing accumulation of information from current research , unbalanced judgments are sustained by the prevalent belief that , after the historic and extensive work on the transitions to chaos carried out a few decades ago , there are no major unknown features left to be revealed , nor intrinsic value in new approaches . here",
    "we attempt to break this impasse by explaining as plainly as possible the manner in which @xmath0-statistics manifests at the transitions to chaos , and by indicating how it relates to previous approaches , such as the ` thermodynamic formalism ' for nonlinear dynamics as adapted by mori and colleagues @xcite to the study of this kind of attractor .",
    "when the control parameter of a nonlinear one - dimensional map is set at the threshold between periodic and chaotic motion  an unusual and complicated dynamics arises , whose features have been explored long ago grassberger2-@xcite and described recently in greater detail robledo0 - @xcite .",
    "for both the period doubling and the quasiperiodic routes to chaos the transition from periodic to chaotic behavior is mediated by the appearance of a multifractal ` critical ' attractor with geometrical properties already known for a couple of decades @xcite-@xcite .",
    "critical attractors have a vanishing lyapunov coefficient @xmath2 and a sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath3 that does not converge to any single - valued function but instead displays a fluctuating pattern that grows as a power law in time @xmath4 mori1 . trajectories _ within _",
    "such a critical attractor show self - similar temporal structures , they preserve memory of their previous locations and do not have the mixing property of truly chaotic trajectories @xcite . a special version of the thermodynamic formalism for deterministic chaos @xcite ,",
    "@xcite-@xcite was adapted long ago @xcite to study the dynamics at critical attractors and quantitative results were obtained that provided a first understanding , particularly about the envelope of the fluctuating @xmath5 and the occurrence of a so - called ` @xmath0-phase ' dynamical phase transition @xcite .",
    "below we describe the scaling properties of the fluctuating sensitivity @xmath6 _ at _ a multifractal critical attractor as well as those of its associated spectra of _ generalized _ lyapunov coefficients @xmath7 ( where @xmath8 stands for the initial position of trajectories ) .",
    "we illustrate these properties and their connection to the @xmath0-statistical expressions by considering mainly the specific case of the period doubling onset of chaos , i.e. the so - called feigenbaum attractor .",
    "we explain that the dynamics at the attractor consists of families of dynamical @xmath0-phase transitions and discuss the ensuing relationship between the thermodynamic and the @xmath0-statistical formalisms .",

    "@xcite suffer shortcomings that seem to stem from overconfidence and poor reading of the studies cited there , particularly @xcite - @xcite .",
    "another reason for adopting an extended ` comment ' layout is that the customary channels for response have been discouraged or barred by the editors of the journal and magazine where the criticisms have been published , preventing an informed , in - depth and balanced debate on this issue .",
    "we would wish that this propagation of swiftly - taken and disingenuous judgements be counterbalanced by standard objective reasoning .",
    "in section 2 we sum up the features of @xmath0-statistics in relation to the dynamics we discuss . in section 3",
    "we explain the structure of @xmath5 for the fluctuating dynamics at the feigenbaum attractor .",
    "we point out there that this dynamical structure is distinguished by a built - in ` aging ' or ` waiting time ' scaling law . in section 4",
    "we describe the relationship between the thermodynamic approach and @xmath0-statistics as applied to critical attractors .",
    "we indicate that the fixed values for the tsallis @xmath0 index correspond to the values that mori s field variable @xmath9 takes at the dynamical phase transitions , i.e. @xmath10 . in section 5",
    "we demonstrate the condition for the linear growth of the @xmath0-entropy @xmath11 , i.e. the occurrence of @xmath0-phase transitions .",
    "we also prove the identity between the rates of @xmath0-entropy growth and the @xmath0-generalized lyapunov coefficients .",
    "for clarity of presentation  the previous sections focus on the properties that link only the two dominant scaling regions of the multifractal attractor , its most crowded and most sparse . in section 6",
    "all the scaling regions of the multifractal are considered , it is shown how @xmath12 is obtained in terms of the discontinuities of feigenbaum s trajectory scaling function @xmath13 , and it is observed that the entire dynamics is made of a hierarchical family of pairs of @xmath0-phase transitions . in section 7",
    "we refer to the parallelisms in the expression of @xmath0-statistics in the other two routes to chaos displayed by low - dimensional maps , via quasiperiodicity and via intermittency . in section 8",
    "we summarize the main results .",
    "first of all it is indispensable to stipulate what ( according to the author ) is intended by the manifestation of @xmath0-statistics in the dynamics at a critical attractor .",
    "this can be summarized in two related properties .",
    "the first concerns the ( finite time ) sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath5 , defined as @xmath14where @xmath15 is the initial separation of two trajectories and @xmath16 that at time @xmath4 .",

    "the second property relates to ` temporal extensivity ' of entropy production @xcite at critical attractors @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , robledo7 .",
    "that is , linear growth with time @xmath4 of the entropy associated to an ensemble of trajectories .",
    "the fitting expression for the rate of entropy production @xmath20 to be used is thought to be given by @xmath21where @xmath22is the tsallis entropy @xcite and where @xmath23 is the distribution of the trajectories in the ensemble at time @xmath4 given that they were distributed initially within a small interval around @xmath8 .",
    "recall that @xmath24 is the inverse of @xmath25 and notice the explicit dependence of all quantities on the initial position @xmath8 .",
    "several comments are in order :    \\i ) it is anticipated that the index @xmath0 in eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity1 ] ) takes a well defined value determined by the basic attractor properties such as its universal constants . for a multifractal critical attractor",
    "there may be a distinct discrete family of such values for @xmath0 .",
    "\\ii ) because of the memory retention of the trajectories the dependence on @xmath26 in eq . ( [ sensitivity1 ] ) ( or eq .",
    "( [ q - entropyrate1 ] ) ) does not disappear for sufficiently large @xmath4 .",
    "notice that the usual large @xmath4 limiting condition is not present in the definition of @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity1 ] ) nor in eq .",
    "( [ q - entropyrate1 ] ) .",
    "\\iii ) since  @xmath5 fluctuates according to a deterministic pattern ( given by the specific route to chaos studied ) the variable @xmath4 in eq .",
    "( sensitivity1 ) can not run through all positive integers sequentially but only through specific infinite subsets .",
    "however , and as seen below , all times @xmath4 appear in eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity1 ] ) when @xmath8 is varied .",
    "\\iv ) the standard exponential form for @xmath5 with the ordinary @xmath27 is obtained from eq .",

    "( sensitivity1 ) is obtained from an exact transformation of a pure power law @xcite , @xcite , but a faster than exponential @xmath0-sensitivity is rigorously obtained for the critical attractor at a tangent bifurcation @xcite .",

    "1 in a way that makes evident the structure of the time sequences and the power law property that their positions share .",
    "it can be observed there that the positions @xmath52 of the sequences with times @xmath53 , each obtained by running through @xmath54 for a fixed value of @xmath55 fall along straight diagonal lines .",

    "the sequence for @xmath60 belongs to the envelope of @xmath5 while those for other values of @xmath61 are shifted replicas that describe interior values of @xmath5 .",
    "this feature offers an enormous simplification to the study of the dynamics on the attractor .",

    "( [ sensitivity2 ] ) , and its equivalent forms eqs .",
    "( [ sensitivity3 ] ) or ( [ sensitivity4 ] ) , in fact correspond to a more complex form of a scaling law , one that fits the fluctuating dynamics at the attractor , and referred here as a two - time scaling law . below we make clear that the positions of these sequences for large @xmath76 belong to one scaling region within the multifractal , its most sparse region .    a persuasive reason for considering a @xmath0-exponential as a further way to write a power law is the presence of a time scale factor : the generalized lyapunov coefficient @xmath77 that appears multiplying @xmath4 in @xmath3 .",
    "this useful quantity ( hidden in the power law ) can be immediately ` read ' from the anomalous @xmath5 just as the ordinary lyapunov coefficient @xmath2 is read from the exponential @xmath5 of chaotic dynamics .",
    "it is important to stress that it _ is _ in the scaling limit ( large @xmath57 or @xmath76 ) that @xmath5 becomes @xmath78 , and it is _ this _ which transforms ( exactly ) into the @xmath0-exponential @xmath12 .",
    "evidently , reference and use of this property involves more than a mere choice between a power law and a @xmath0-exponential representation of the sensitivity .",
    "the beauty of a scale - free power law is there to enjoy .",

    "the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity2 ] ) for @xmath80 is given in @xcite so there is no need to reproduce it in grassberger1 .",
    "so , what is the advantage in studying the nonmixing trajectories at the feigenbaum attractor in terms of the above - explained power - law network structure for @xmath5 instead of the time and position averages described in @xcite ? clearly , the dynamical organization within the attractor is hard to resolve from a simple time evolution : starting from an arbitrary position @xmath8 _ on _ the attractor and recorded at every @xmath81 .",
    "what is observed are strong fluctuations with a scrambled structure that persist in time .",
    "conversely , unsystematic averages over @xmath8 and/or @xmath4 would rub out details of the multiscale properties .",
    "however , if specific initial positions with known location within the multifractal are chosen , and subsequent positions are observed _ only _ at pre - selected times , e.g. @xmath47 , when the trajectories visit another region of choice , a well - defined @xmath0-exponential sensitivity @xmath5 appears , with @xmath0 and the lyapunov spectrum @xmath82 fixed by the attractor universal constants .",
    "we now address the connection between the thermodynamic approach as employed by mori and colleagues @xcite to study dynamical phase transitions at critical attractors and the @xmath0-statistical properties of the feigenbaum attractor . in particular :",

    "it differs however from eq .",
    "( 4 ) in @xcite in that no time average is taken . as a function of consecutive values of @xmath4 , @xmath85",
    "does not converge to any constant but does undergo recurrence .",
    "this recurrence suggests inspection of @xmath85 for values of @xmath4 along the time sequences described in the previous section .",
    "a straightforward calculation shows that @xmath86 as defined in eq .",

    "as before , the special values for @xmath0 in @xmath5 are equal to those of the field variable q in mori s formalism at which the transitions occur @xcite . since the amplitudes of the discontinuities of @xmath13 diminish rapidly , there is a hierarchical structure and consideration only of the dominant discontinuity provides a sound description of the dynamics .",
    "when all discontinuities are considered it becomes apparent that the dynamics on the critical attractor is constituted in its entirety by the infinite but discrete set of @xmath0-phase transitions .",
    "we reproduce below some basic expressions @xcite .",
    "the trajectory scaling function @xmath13 is obtained as the @xmath183 limit of @xmath184where the numbers @xmath185 are the so - called diameters that measure the bifurcation forks that form the period - doubling cascade sequence schuster1 .",
    "the diameters are determined from the positions of the superstable periodic orbits of lengths @xmath186 , i.e. the @xmath186-cycles that contain the point @xmath187 at @xmath188 schuster1 .",
    "this function has finite ( jump ) discontinuities at all rationals of the form @xmath189 , and we denote the values of @xmath190 before and after them ( omitting the subindex @xmath76 ) as @xmath191 and @xmath192 , respectively .",
    "the numbers @xmath193 are universal constants . for the largest discontinuity @xmath194 one",
    "has @xmath195 and @xmath196 .",
    "the strategy employed @xcite in determining @xmath5 from @xmath190 is to chose the initial and the final separation of the trajectories to be the diameters @xmath197 and @xmath198 , @xmath199 , respectively .",
    "so , @xmath200 , @xmath201 , is obtained as @xmath202notice that in the @xmath181 limit @xmath203 , @xmath102 _ and _ the @xmath186-supercycle becomes the onset of chaos ( the @xmath204-supercycle ) .",
    "then , for each discontinuity of @xmath13 at @xmath205 , @xmath200 can be written as @xcite @xmath206for the inverse process , starting at @xmath207 and ending at @xmath208 , with @xmath209 one obtains @xcite @xmath210therefore    @xmath211    and , similarly to eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity2 ] ) , the sensitivities in eq .",
    "( sensitivity9 ) can be re - expressed as @xmath0-exponentials with @xmath0-indexes@xmath212respectively .",
    "all other consequences described in the previous sections follow in a straightforward manner .",
    "it is interesting to note that discrete infinite families of values for the index @xmath0 arise in different contexts , such as in the proposed @xmath0-generalization of the ordinary and lvy - gnedenko central limit theorems @xcite .    as a check on the leading role of the most crowded and sparse regions of the attractor in determining its dynamics we consider a two - scale cantor set approximation of the multifractal attractor of fractal dimension @xmath213 . following a standard procedure @xcite for a trajectory @xmath214large , on the attractor",
    "we cover it with a set of intervals of lengths @xmath215 , @xmath216 .",
    "the smallest length scale @xmath217 is observed in the neighborhood of @xmath218 while the largest @xmath219 occurs near @xmath187 .",
    "trajectories starting in the vicinity of @xmath218 in the multifractal visit the vicinity of @xmath187 at times of the form @xmath47 . in the two - scale set the equivalent trajectories of duration @xmath47 starting at positions assigned to the scale @xmath220 visit positions that correspond to the scale @xmath221 a number of times equal to @xmath222 .",
    "for these times @xmath223 @xmath224 otherwise @xmath225 .",
    "use of this in the time - averaged expansion rate @xcite@xmath226leads to@xmath227or @xmath228as @xmath229 @xcite we obtain @xmath230 which falls ( given the number of digits considered in the value of @xmath213 ) within @xmath231 of the numerical value reported for @xmath232 in grassberger1 .",
    "( [ beta ] ) is indeed a very simple relation linking the expansion rate constant @xmath232 and the universal constant @xmath178 .",
    "with reference to the generality of our results for the feigenbaum attractor , and besides all unimodal maps of arbitrary nonlinearity @xmath80 , there is a very similar picture obtained for another important multifractal critical attractor .",
    "this corresponds to the quasiperiodic route to chaos , recently studied @xcite in the framework of the familiar golden - mean ( gm ) onset of chaos in the critical circle map @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the dynamics on the attractor ( a fat fractal @xcite ) is more involved than that for the feigenbaum case but there is a strong parallelism that can be glimpsed through the following equivalences when only the most crowded and most sparse attractor regions are considered robledo7 :    \\i ) the time sequences along which the sensitivity to initial conditions exhibits the power law scaling @xmath233 are @xmath234 , where @xmath235 is the fibonacci number of order @xmath76 , each sequence is obtained by running through @xmath236 for fixed values of @xmath237 and @xmath238 .",
    "notice that the sequences now depend on one additional index . as before there is a time shift @xmath239 , here with @xmath240 , linking the two scales @xmath4 and @xmath57 and with the property that rescaling of the form @xmath62 makes all power law sequences collapse into a single one .",
    "the number @xmath178 is now the absolute value of the universal constant @xmath241 obtained as the scaling factor that satisfies the fixed - point map equation @xmath242 .",
    "\\ii ) the role of the period doubling time scale factor @xmath186 is now taken ( asymptotically ) by @xmath243 where @xmath244 is the golden mean .",
    "\\iii ) the sensitivity is given by @xmath0-exponentials as in eqs .",
    "( sensitivity3 ) and ( [ sensitivity5 ] ) with @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath133 and @xmath247 .",
    "\\iv ) a pair of @xmath0-phase transitions take place at @xmath119 and at @xmath248 @xmath133 , that correspond to switching starting and finishing orbital positions . and ,",
    "as before , linear growth ( or reduction ) of the tsallis entropy @xmath249 occurs when @xmath119 ( or @xmath250 ) with rates @xmath251 ( or @xmath252 ) .",
    "more generally , use of the trajectory scaling function @xmath13 for the golden mean quasiperiodic attractor reveals an infinite family of pairs of @xmath253-phase transitions , with a hierarchical structure , each member with properties like in i - iv above @xcite . as before the dominant behavior arises from the most crowded and most sparse regions of the multifractal .",
    "furthermore , it is significant to call attention to the fact that the fixed - point map solution of @xmath37 for the tangent bifurcations of unimodal maps of general nonlinearity @xmath80 , the third route to chaos , is rigorously given by a @xmath0-exponential map .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this feature leads immediately to a @xmath0-exponential @xmath12 with @xmath254 for all @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "the tangent bifurcations display weak insensitivity to initial conditions , i.e. power - law convergence of orbits when at the left - hand side ( @xmath255 ) of the point of tangency @xmath256 .",
    "however at the right - hand side ( @xmath257 ) of the bifurcation there is a ` super - strong ' sensitivity to initial conditions , i.e. a sensitivity that grows faster than exponential @xcite .",
    "the two different behaviors can be couched as a @xmath0-phase transition with indexes @xmath0 and @xmath182 for the two sides of the tangency point . also a two time or aging scaling property like that in eq .",
    "( [ sensitivity4 ] ) holds for this critical attractor @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity @xmath5 is dependent on the initial position @xmath8 or , equivalently , on its waiting time @xmath64 ; the closer @xmath8 is to the point of tangency the longer @xmath64 but the sensitivity of all trajectories fall on the same @xmath0-exponential curve when plotted against @xmath62 .",
    "it is worthwhile to underscore that in this case the @xmath0-exponential is _ not _ an alternative way to express a power law but the exact function that describes the faster than exponential increase of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , we have explained in detail the dynamics at the feigenbaum and other critical attractors . in all cases",
    "the fluctuating sensitivity to initial conditions has the form of infinitely many interlaced @xmath0-exponentials that fold into a single one with use of the two - time scaling @xmath62 property .",
    "more precisely , there is a hierarchy of such families of interlaced @xmath0-exponentials ; an intricate ( and previously unknown ) state of affairs that befits the rich scaling features of a multifractal attractor .",
    "therefore , the comment in the abstract of ref .",
    "@xcite that `` the ... behavior at the feigenbaum point based on non - extensive thermodynamics ... can be easily deduced from well - known properties of the feigenbaum attractor '' is somewhat an overstatement .",
    "summing up , the incidence of @xmath0-statistics in the temporal scaling at the feigenbaum attractor is verified ; the @xmath0-exponential sensitivity is explained ; the origin of the index @xmath0 is made clear ; and the equality between @xmath0-generalized lyapunov coefficients and @xmath0-entropy growth rates is demonstrated .",
    "a similar corroboration applies to the other two known routes to chaos , those via quasiperiodicity and via intermittency .",
