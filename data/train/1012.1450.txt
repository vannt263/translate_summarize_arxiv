    "in the orthodox way of unification , such as the standard model and the grand unified theories , fundamental fermions belonging individually to the irreducible representations of the external lorentz group are organized into definite multiplets of the internal symmetry group . here",
    ", we propose an unorthodox scheme of unification where a family of fundamental fermions is described by a master spinor field obeying to a generalized dirac equation with coefficients belonging to an algebra , called a _ triplet algebra _ , which consists of all the triple - direct - products of the dirac matrices . in accordance with the coleman - mandula theorem  @xcite insisting that spacetime and internal symmetries can not be combined in any but a trivial way , we decompose the triplet algebra into mutually - commutative subalgebras .",
    "the subalgebra related with internal property of fundamental fermions , _ quarks and leptons _ , is made up of two subalgebras which can be related , respectively , to repetitional family structure and color symmetry .",
    "the master spinor field , named a _ triplet field _ , is proved to include threefold ( fourfold ) repetitional modes of spin @xmath1 component fields with su(3 ) ( su(4 ) ) color symmetry .",
    "we construct explicitly the triplet algebra and its subalgebra for the external spacetime symmetry in  2 and define the triplet field forming a multiple representation of the lorentz group in  3 .",
    "characteristic of the subalgebra for internal properties of fundamental fermions is closely examined in  4 and  5 .",
    "first , chirality operators acting on the triplet field are decomposed further into the sums of the projection operators which can be interpreted to discriminate repetitional degrees of freedom for family structure .",
    "second , we find the algebra for color symmetry in the set of the elements which are commutative both with the chirality operators and all elements of the algebra for external symmetry . in the present scheme ,",
    "the triplet field has no degrees of freedom for the symmetry of electroweak interaction . in  6 , we reformulate the standard model by introducing the set of chiral triplet fields for the left - handed doublet and the right - handed singlets of the weinberg - salam symmetry .",
    "it turns out possible to qualify the yukawa interaction and make a new interpretation on the yukawa coupling constants naturally in an intrinsic mechanism of the triplet field formalism . as an explicit illustration ,",
    "the dirac mass matrices with quasi - democratic structure are derived .",

    "the projection operators to the quark and lepton sectors are constructed , respectively , by @xmath110 and @xmath111 which are subject to the relations @xmath112 for @xmath113 .",

    "for the eight operators @xmath100  @xmath126 , we obtain the commutation relations in ( [ comsu4 ] ) with the structure constants @xmath105 of the su(3 ) group and anticommutation relations @xmath127 note that the projection operator @xmath115 appears in the right hand side of this relation . without it ,",
    "this relation runs into contradiction , when applied to the operator @xmath128 from the right",
    ". the identities @xmath129 which hold for @xmath130 and @xmath131 imply that @xmath132 are simultaneous eigenvectors of @xmath115 and @xmath128 with respective eigenvalues 1 and 0 , and that the operators @xmath132 annihilate the leptonic mode .",
    "these results prove that the 9 dimensional submanifold of the extended color algebra @xmath133 defined by @xmath134 generates the color su@xmath109(3 ) group .",

    "the quark and lepton fields are projected out by @xmath136 respectively , for @xmath137 , and four color modes of su@xmath109(4 ) symmetry are given by @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",

    "therefore , to describe the actual system of quarks and leptons in this algebraic scheme , it is required to prepare a set of triplet fields to make up for the deficit degrees of freedom for electroweak interaction .    here",
    "we incorporate the weinberg - salam symmetry into our formalism by introducing the set of chiral triplet fields so that the left - handed triplets constitute the doublet @xmath154 and the right - handed triplets form the singlets @xmath155 of the electroweak isospin , where @xmath156 and @xmath157 signify the up and down states .",
    "the quark and lepton parts of the electroweak doublet @xmath158 have the component modes expressed schematically as @xmath159 and @xmath160 similarly , the electroweak singlets @xmath161 and @xmath162 possess the quark and lepton parts with contents of the component modes as follows : @xmath163 @xmath164 @xmath165 and @xmath166    the chiral triplets in ( [ chiraldoublet ] ) and ( [ chiralsinglets ] ) enable us to express the lagrangian density of the kinetic part including the gauge interactions of quarks and leptons in the generic form @xmath167 with the covariant derivatives @xmath168 .",
    "in the low energy regime where the standard model can be applied , the covariant derivatives act on the triplet fields as follows : @xmath169 @xmath170 and @xmath171 where @xmath172 and @xmath173 are the gauge fields which interact , respectively , to the electroweak isospin @xmath174 of su@xmath175 and the hypercharge of u@xmath153(1 ) , and @xmath176 is the gauge field of color symmetry .",
    "this density @xmath177 is readily proved to reproduce the gauge interactions of the standard model with right - handed neutrino species .    in the present scheme ,",
    "the chiral triplet fields include the repetitional degrees of freedom for family structure .",

    ", the operator must be composed of triple - direct - products of the dirac matrices @xmath181 and @xmath11 . to frame its generic construction",
    ", we impose the conditions that it is self - adjoint and it brings forth the quasi - democratic mass matrices in the low energy regime . as a natural candidate for @xmath182 , we adopt @xmath183 with real parameters @xmath184 and @xmath185 .    the quark part of the lagrangian density in ( [ yukawaint ] ) is readily decomposed into the yukawa interactions among component quark fields as @xmath186\\phi    \\psi_{jr}^{(a)}.\\ ] ] this result and the similar decomposition of the lepton part lead us to the interpretation that the quantities @xmath187 are the yukawa coupling constants of the @xmath188 sector @xmath189 .    in the low energy regime where the higgs field takes the vacuum expectation value @xmath190 and , consequently , the weinberg - salam symmetry is broken , the yukawa interaction with the kernel in ( [ kernel ] ) results in the dirac mass matrices @xmath191 where @xmath192 , @xmath193 and @xmath194 ( cyclic ) .",
    "this type of the hermitian quasi - democratic matrices are recognized to explain the hierarchical structures of mass spectra and the weak mixing matrix for the quark sector  @xcite .",
    "in this way , we have formulated an algebraic theory for unified description of external and internal symmetries of quarks and leptons .",
    "the basic ingredients of the theory are the _ triplet algebra _ consisting of all the triple - direct - products of the dirac matrices and the _ triplet field _ forming the multiple spinor representation of the lorentz group .",
    "the triplet field has the @xmath59 component fields which afford the freedom for the repetitional family structure as well as the external spacetime symmetry and the internal color symmetry .    by postulating the triplet fields of the electroweak doublet and singlets to exist , the standard model with three generations",
    "is successfully reproduced so that the yukawa interactions are formulated , without bringing in many unknown coupling constants from outside , and the dirac mass matrices with quasi - democratic structure are naturally derived .",
    "the present formalism is flexible enough to be applicable to various field theories suitable for descriptions for different energy scales .",
    "removing of the constraint in ( [ constraint ] ) enables us formulate the four generation theory of quarks and leptons and introduction of the right - handed electroweak doublet in place of the singlets in ( [ chiralsinglets ] ) allows us to obtain the gauge theory of left - right symmetry .",
    "further , we can bring in the gauge symmetry for repetitional family modes .",
    "note that the three dirac matrices @xmath195 , @xmath196 and @xmath197 generate the pauli algebra . taking the triple - direct - products of these elements just as in ( [ gencolorsym ] ) , we can construct the 16 dimensional submanifold which generates the su(4 ) group for family symmetry .",
    "therefore , it is possible to formulate the gauge field theory with the symmetry su@xmath198su@xmath152su@xmath199su@xmath200(4 ) in the triplet field formalism .      9",
