    "the electrical transport properties of nanocomposites are potentially enhanced by conducting fillers with high aspect - ratios , as for particles having rod - like or disk - like geometries . for examples ,",
    "polymeric composites containing carbon nanotubes or conducting nanofibers display relatively large conductivities even at particle loadings below one percent in volume fraction @xcite . at such small loadings",
    "the physical properties of the insulating medium are preserved , leading for example to electrically conducting composites which are also lightweight and mechanically flexible .    in dispersions of conducting nanofillers ,",
    "the electrical connectivity is established by quantum tunneling or hopping of electrons through the insulating regions separating the fillers .",
    "the enhanced conductivity at small loading of high - aspect - ratio fillers is basically explained by the large excluded volume associated to the fillers , which has the net effect of reducing the filler separation needed to establish tunneling connectivity @xcite .",
    "excluded volume arguments predicts also that anisotropy in the orientation of the fillers decreases the system conductivity @xcite , as mutual alignment of rod - like fillers reduces the excluded volume at a given loading .",
    "theories and computer simulations , either using the percolation approach to describe the electrical connectedness @xcite or considering explicitly its tunneling / hopping nature @xcite , confirm the general trend predicted by the excluded volume argument .",
    "further theoretical studies have investigated the role of filler waviness @xcite , attractive forces between the fillers @xcite , and filler size polydispersity @xcite on the electrical connectedness in systems of high - aspect ratio particles , extending thus our understanding of this class of nanocomposizes @xcite .    however , the current state of research is based on the assumption that the electrical connectivity between any two high - aspect - ratio fillers depends only on their relative distance , and ignores possible contributions arising from the relative orientation of the fillers .",
    "one expects instead that the probability of electron tunneling between two perpendicular rods is smaller than that occurring between two perfectly aligned rods at the same distance .",
    "this is so because the overlap between the wave functions centered on two parallel rods extends over the whole length of the rods , while for perpendicular rods the overlap is limited to the region of closest approach .",
    "an interesting question is thus whether the orientation dependence of tunneling has any relevant effect on the conductivity of composites with rod - like fillers .",
    "in particular , clarifying how enhanced tunneling between aligned rods competes with the reduction of connectivity of anisotropic rod orientations may be of special relevance for those nanotube and nanofiber composites with high degrees of rod alignment @xcite .",
    "even more compelling is the issue concerning the role of tunneling anisotropy on the conductivity of rods experiencing van der waals forces or depletion interactions @xcite , as these induce a strongly anisotropic attraction that favors alignment of neighboring rods @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we derive the dependence of the tunneling matrix element on the relative orientation of two slender conducting rods .",
    "we show that the resulting tunneling conductance strongly increases as the angle between the two rod axes decreases , and that it decays exponentially with the shortest distance between the two rod cores . by using the full functional dependence of tunneling on the spatial configuration of the rods ,",
    "we calculate the composite conductivity within an effective medium approximation for dispersions of rods with high aspect - ratio .",
    "we show that for isotropically distributed rod orientations , the angular dependence of tunneling has only a marginal effect for all volume fractions , confirming that tunneling transport in this case is dominated solely by the relative distances between the rods . on the contrary , for dispersions with high - degrees of rod alignments",
    ", we find that anisotropic tunneling may enhance significantly the effective medium conductivity with respect to the case in which the angular dependence of tunneling is ignored .",
    "we also consider suspensions of rods with short - range attractive interactions , as to simulate the effective attraction that rods experience when small depletant particles are added to the system . we show that the tunneling matrix element and the attraction potential between the rods have a similar angular dependence and that they combine together to increase the contribution of aligned rods to the composite conductivity .",
    "we find that in the presence of anisotropic tunneling even moderate attractions can enhance the effective conductivity by several orders of magnitude .",
    "to describe tunneling of electrons between rod - like nanoparticles , we model the particle geometry by a cylinder of length @xmath4 and diameter @xmath0 , and consider each cylinder as a quantum well in which electrons are confined by a square - well potential @xmath5 . in the following",

    "the energy levels @xmath16 can be found by imposing boundary conditions on the cylinder surface .",
    "we note however that for @xmath33 the much stronger confinement in the radial direction as compared to the @xmath7 direction allows us to assume that only the lowest electronic sub - band in the radial direction is occupied . we thus take @xmath34 in eq .   and define the wave function outside the cylindrical well as : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the tunneling decay length and @xmath37 is the radial wave function on the cylindrical surface . noting that @xmath38 for @xmath39 , we see that in the strong localization regime @xmath40 the wave function falls off exponentially with the distance @xmath41 from the cylinder surface , that is : @xmath42 $ ] for @xmath43 .",
