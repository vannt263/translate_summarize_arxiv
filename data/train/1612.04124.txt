    "inflation has become the most acceptable paradigm that describes the physics of the very early universe . besides of solving most of the shortcomings of the hot big - bang scenario , like the horizon , the flatness , and the monopole problems @xcite",
    ", inflation also generates a causal mechanism to explain the large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe @xcite and the origin of the anisotropies observed in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation @xcite , since primordial density perturbations may be sourced from quantum fluctuations of the inflaton scalar field during the inflationary expansion .",
    "several representative inflationary models have been studied within the framework of the so - called slow - roll approximation @xcite , where the kinetic term of the inflaton field is much smaller than the potential energy , i.e. @xmath6 , together with the approximation @xmath7 . moreover , in this approach the full shape of the inflaton potential is considered in order to identify the value of the scalar field at the end of inflation and hence the value of the scalar field when the largest scales observable today cross the hubble radius . upon comparison to the current cosmological and astronomical observations , specially those related with the cmb temperature anisotropies , it is possible to constrain several inflation models .",
    "particularly , the constraints in the @xmath3 plane give us the predictions of a number of representative inflationary potentials .",
    "recently , the planck collaboration has published new data of enhanced precision of the cmb anisotropies @xcite . here",
    ", the planck full mission data has improved the upper bound on the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath8(@xmath9 cl ) which is similar to obtained from @xcite , in which @xmath10 ( @xmath9 cl ) . from the particle physics point of view , it is natural to begin by specifying the functional form of the potential .",
    "however , even for simple choices , such as exponential @xcite , constant @xcite or power - law potentials @xcite , it is not possible to go further analytically .",
    "an alternative way is to specify the time - dependence of the scale factor @xmath11 .",
    "following refs.@xcite .",
    "exact solutions can also be found in the scenario of intermediate inflation . in this inflationary model",
    "the scale factor evolves as @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are two constant parameters such that @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the expansion rate of this scale factor is slower than de sitter inflation @xcite , for which @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the hubble rate , which is a contant , but faster than power - law inflation , @xmath19 @xcite , where @xmath20 .",
    "alternative to the slow - roll approximation , there is another method for studying inflation known as the hamilton - jacobi approach @xcite .",
    "this formulation is a powerful way of rewriting the equations of motion for single - field inflation .",
    "it can be derived by considering the scalar field itself to be the time variable , which is possible during any epoch in which the scalar field evolves monotonically with time .",
    "it allows us to consider the hubble rate or hubble function @xmath1 ( from now on , not confuse with with the hamiltonian function @xmath18 ) , rather than the inflaton scalar potential @xmath2 , as the fundamental quantity to be specified . because @xmath1 , unlike @xmath2 , is a geometric quantity",
    ", inflation is described more naturally in that language .",
    "the advantage of such an approach is that the form of the potential is readily deduced .",
    "as it was suggested in refs.@xcite , @xmath1 should be viewed as the solution generating function when analysing inflationary cosmologies .",
    "for instance , @xmath21 gives the power - law inflation model @xcite .",
    "furthermore , this formalism has been considered by planck collaboration in order to reconstruct the inflaton potential beyond slow - roll approximation @xcite . for a representative list of recent inflation models studied under hamilton - jacobi formalism where several expressions for @xmath1 have been considered ,",

    "it is interesting to mention that this model presents an improvement in comparison to power - law inflation model @xcite , because the first one addresses the graceful - exit problem of inflation and the value predicted for the tensor - to - scalar ratio was compatible with seven - year wmap @xcite , being supported by the current data available at that time .",
    "the main goal of the present work is to study the realization of inflation by reconsidering the expression for the hubble rate given by eq.([hexp ] ) , in the light of the recent planck results .",
    "we stress that our work is different to previous work @xcite in three ways .",
    "firstly , in this work we restrict ourselves only to the inflationary predictions of this models . secondly , in the previous paper the authors did not used the contour plots in the @xmath3 and @xmath26 planes to constrain the parameters of the model they studied .",
    "finally , in our work here we make use the latest data from planck , not available at that time , to put bounds on the parameters of the model .",
    "we will show that our results are modified compared to @xcite using the planck results . by comparing the theoretical predictions of the model together with the allowed contour plots in the @xmath3 plane ,",
    "the model predicts a value for the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 detectable by planck , and we conclude that the model is viable .",
    "we organize our work as follows : after this introduction , in the next section we summarize the dynamics of inflation in the hamilton - jacobi formalism . in the third section",
    "we analyze the inflation dynamics of the hubble rate given by eq.([hexp ] ) in the hamilton - jacobi framework , obtaining expressions for the scalar power spectrum , scalar spectral index , and tensor - to - scalar ratio in terms of the free parameters characterizing the model which are constrained by considering the planck 2015 results , through the allowed contour plots in the @xmath27 plane and the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum . in section [ wi ]",
    "we discuss a little further how in the warm inflation scenario the radiation - dominated phase is achieved without introducing the reheating phase for this quasi - exponential hubble function . in the last section we finish with our conclusions .",
    "we choose units so that @xmath28 .",
    "in the simplest model of inflation in einstein s general relativity is a classical homogeneous scalar field @xmath29 , named the inflaton field , which is introduced into the action .",
    "the properties of the scalar potential determine how inflation evolves .",
    "for a flat friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , the friedmann and acceleration equations become @xmath30 and @xmath31    respectively , where @xmath32 corresponds to the planck mass .",
    "besides the einstein equations , the field satisfies the klein - gordon equation in this flrw universe @xmath33 where prime indicates derivative with respect to @xmath34 , and dot a derivative with respect to cosmic time .",
    "the friedmann and klein - gordon equations are the basis to construct the hamilton - jacobi formulation . by combining eqs.([h2 ] ) and ( [ kg ] ) , we obtain the following expression @xmath35    which gives the relation between @xmath34 and cosmic time @xmath36 .",

    "the number of @xmath50-folds between the hubble - radius crossing and the end of inflation yields @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the values of the scalar field when the cosmological scales cross the hubble - radius and at the end of inflation , respectively .",
    "the last value is found by @xmath54 .",
    "the hamilton - jacobi approach is usefull to show that all possible inflationary trajectories will rapidly converge to a common attractor solution , if they are sufficiently close to each other initially .",

    "replacing @xmath58 in eq.([hj ] ) and linearizing , we have that @xmath59 integrating last expression we get @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the initial value of the perturbation at @xmath62 . knowing @xmath1 , it is possible to study the behaviour of perturbation @xmath56 .    in the next section",
    "we will give a review of cosmological perturbations and use hubble hierarchy parameters for describing scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "we consider the gauge invariant quantity @xmath63 . here , @xmath64 is defined on slices of uniform density and reduces to the curvature perturbation @xmath65 at super - horizon scales .",
    "a fundamental feature of @xmath64 is that it is nearly constant on super - horizon scales @xcite , and in fact this property does not depend on the gravitational field equations @xcite .",

    ", the energy density related to the scalar field predominates over the energy density of the radiation field , i.e. , @xmath159@xcite , but even if small when compared to the inflaton energy density it can be larger than the expansion rate with @xmath160 .",
    "assuming thermalization , this translates roughly into @xmath146 , which is the condition for warm inflation to occur .",
    "when @xmath18 , @xmath34 , and @xmath145 are slowly varying , which is a good approximation during inflation , the production of radiation becomes quasi - stable , i.e. , @xmath161 and @xmath162 , see refs.@xcite .",
    "then , the energy density of the radiation field becomes @xmath163 if we consider thermalization , then the energy density of the radiation field could be written as @xmath164 , where the constant @xmath165 .",
    "here , @xmath166 represents the number of relativistic degrees of freedom . by combining eqs.([freq ] ) and ( [ key_01 ] ) , the time derivative of the hubble function is given by @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the dissipative ratio , defined as @xmath169 .",
    "in warm inflation , we can distinguish between two possible scenarios , namely the weak and strong dissipative regimes , defined as @xmath170 and @xmath171 , respectively . in the weak dissipative regime ,",
    "the hubble damping is still the dominant term , however , in the strong dissipative regime , the dissipative coefficient @xmath145 controls the damped evolution of the inflaton field .    by expressing the time derivative of the hubble function in terms of inflaton field derivative ,",
    "the time derivative of inflaton field becomes @xmath172 which is the same expression found in @xcite , where warm inflation under the hamilton - jacobi formalism has been studied recently .",
    "introducing the dimensionless hubble hierarchy parameter @xmath41 , we write @xmath173    it is possible to find a relation between the energy densities @xmath150 and @xmath152 by combining eqs.([key_02n ] ) , ( [ fdot ] ) , and ( [ ehw ] ) , so that @xmath174    warm inflation takes place when the parameter @xmath41 satisfies @xmath49 .",
    "this condition given above implies that during inflation the energy density of the inflaton field satisfies @xmath175 .",
    "then , at the end of inflation , when @xmath176 , we have that @xmath177 .",
    "the universe stops inflating and heats up to become radiation dominated at the time when @xmath178 .",
    "this is one of the most attractive features of warm inflation , since provides a smooth transition to the radiation - dominated epoch without introducing a reheating epoch .",
    "given that for the quasi - exponential hubble function the inflaton potential does not present a minimum , the dynamics for this model in warm inflation scenario provides a solution for the problem of reheating .",
    "the perturbation dynamics of warm inflation with the quasi - exponential hubble function deserves a more further analysis which goes beyond the scope of this work .",
    "to summarize , in this article we have studied an inflationary model the hubble rate has an quasi - exponential dependence in the inflaton field .",
    "we have studied the inflation dynamics in the hamilton - jacobi formalism , in which the scalar field itself to be the time variable , which is possible during any epoch in which the scalar field evolves monotonically with time .",
    "it allows us to consider the hubble function @xmath1 , rather than the inflaton potential @xmath2 , as the fundamental quantity to be specified . because @xmath1 , unlike @xmath2 , is a geometric quantity ,",
    "inflation is described more naturally in that language .",
    "this model is characterized by the dimensionless parameter @xmath23 and @xmath25 . in order to constraints our model ,",
    "we have considered the amplitude of the primordial scalar perturbations , as well as the allowed contour plots in @xmath3 and @xmath179 planes from planck 2015 data .",
    "first , in the @xmath3 plane we show the theoretical predictions of the model for three different values of @xmath50-folds @xmath123 , 60 , and 65 . by finding the points where each @xmath122 curve enters the joint @xmath9 cl region , the allowed range for the @xmath23 parameter",
    "may be determined .",
    "after that , using the constraint for the amplitude of scalar perturbations we determined the allowed range for @xmath25 .",
    "in addition , in the @xmath180 plane we show that all the three @xmath136 curves for @xmath123 , 60 , and 65 lie inside the @xmath117 as well as @xmath9 cl regions from planck .",
    "this model predicts values for the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath4 and for the running of the scalar spectral index consistent with the current bounds imposed by planck 2015 , and we conclude that the model is viable . as we mention before , this quasi - exponential form of the hubble rate",
    "presents a graceful - exit of inflation , however , the inflaton potential does not present a minimum , which raises the issue of how to address the problem of reheating . in order to address last problem and as a first approach to further research , in section [ wi ] we discussed how in the warm inflation scenario the radiation - dominated phase",
    "is achieved without introducing the reheating phase for this quasi - exponential hubble function .",
    "we hope to return to this point in the near future ."
