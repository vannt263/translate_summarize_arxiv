    "entanglement is of very importance in most quantum communication protocols . the typical quantum communication protocols such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) @xcite and other important quantum communication protocols all require entanglement to set up quantum channel . in a standard quantum communication protocol",
    ", one of the communication parties should create the entanglement locally and distribute it to another to share entanglement .",
    "unfortunately , during the entanglement distribution , the entanglement will suffer from the noise .",
    "the noise will make the photon loss and decoherence .",
    "if the photon is lost , the task of communication is a failure . on the other hand ,",
    "if the entanglement is decoherence , it will induce error , which will decrease the communication efficiency .",
    "more seriously , it will make the communication insecure .",
    "quantum repeaters @xcite and quantum state amplification @xcite are two powerful approaches to overcome the obstacle of photon loss .",
    "quantum repeaters can connect the short distance entanglement to long distance entanglement .",
    "there are some important works of quantum repeaters in various physical systems , such as nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond @xcite , atomic ensembles @xcite , and optical microcavities @xcite .",
    "quantum state amplification is used to increase the probability of the single photon after transmission .",
    "there are also some important theory and experiment works in quantum state amplification @xcite , such as the single qubit amplification @xcite , the single qubit amplification encoded in polarization @xcite and time - bin degrees of freedom @xcite , single - photon entanglement amplification @xcite , and so on . on the other hand , entanglement concentration and entanglement purification are two important approaches to recover the degraded entangled states to maximally entangled states and high quality entangled states , respectively @xcite .",
    "compared with entanglement concentration , entanglement purification which will be detailed is a more general model , which focuses on the mixed states @xcite . in 1996 , bennett _ et al . _ proposed the concept of entanglement purification @xcite . in 2001 , pan _",
    "described a feasible entanglement purification protocol ( epp ) in linear optics @xcite .",
    "based on the cross - kerr nonlinearity , sheng _",
    "et al . _ presented an epp with practical parametric down - conversion sources @xcite .",
    "their protocol can be repeated to obtain a higher fidelity of mixed states . in 2010 ,",
    "the deterministic epp were proposed with the success probability of 100% in principle @xcite . in 2012 , ren _",
    "_ described the first epp model for hyperentanglement @xcite .",
    "recent work shows that the epp can be used to benefit the secure double - server blind quantum computation in a noise environment @xcite .",
    "there are also some other important epps for solid quantum systems , such as atoms @xcite , spins @xcite , and so on .",
    "logic - qubit entanglement encodes many physical qubits in a logic qubits , which has been investigated recently @xcite . in 2011 ,",
    "frwis and dr first discussed a new type of logic - qubit entanglement , called the concatenated greenberger - horne - zeiglinger ( c - ghz ) state @xcite .",
    "the c - ghz state can be described as @xmath0 is the number of logic qubit and @xmath1 is the number of physical qubit in each logic qubit , respectively .",
    "states @xmath2 are the standard @xmath1-photon polarized ghz states as @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the horizonal polarized photon and the vertical polarized photon , respectively . in 2014 , lu _",
    "_ reported the first experiment realization of c - ghz state @xcite .",
    "recently , the logic - qubit entanglement generation @xcite , analysis @xcite and entanglement concentration protocols @xcite were proposed .",
    "previous works of both theory and experiment show that it has the potential application in future quantum communication .    in this paper",
    ", we will investigate the entanglement distillation for logic - qubit entanglement . for point to point quantum communication , we focus on the protocol for the two - logic - qubit entanglement .",
    "previous epps can not deal with logic - qubit entanglement , for they can only purify the errors in physical qubit , while logic - qubit entanglement not only contains the physical - qubit error , but also contains logic - qubit error .",
    "we mainly describe the distillation of three kinds of errors .",
    "the first is the logic bit - flip error .",
    "the second is the logic phase - flip error and the third is the physical bit - flip error .",
    "the physical phase - flip error equals to logic bit - flip error .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we first explain the distillation of the logic bit - flip error . in sec .",

    "vi , we describe the correction of physical bit - flip error . in sec .",
    "v , we extend this protocol to the case that the logic qubit is the arbitrary @xmath1-photon ghz state . in sec .",
    "vi , we present a discussion and a conclusion .",
    "now we start to explain the distillation protocol .",
    "the four two - logic - qubit entanglement can be described as @xmath5 ) essentially is the logic bell states .",
    "such states can be regarded as the c - ghz states with @xmath6 .",
    "suppose two distant parties alice and bob want to share the maximally entangled state @xmath7 .",
    "unfortunately , the noise will make the entanglement degrade .",
    "generally , there are two kinds of error modes .",
    "the first error mode is the logic error .",
    "it contains two errors .",
    "the first is the logic bit - flip error .",
    "it will make one of the logic qubit @xmath8 become @xmath9 , and @xmath9 become @xmath8 , respectively . if a logic qubit - flip error occurs with a probability of @xmath10 , they will obtain a mixed state @xmath11 the second is the logic phase - flip error .",
