    "ultra - narrow linewidth lasers play important roles in high precision metrology , such as high - resolution spectroscopy , optical frequency standards , and fundamental tests of physics @xcite .",
    "to achieve such a frequency stabilized local oscillator , the laser is typically servo locked to a vibration isolated , high - finesse cavity by using the pound - drever - hall ( pdh ) technique @xcite . since the laser frequency follows the modal frequency of the reference cavity , the stability of the reference cavity itself becomes essential to achieve ultra - high frequency stability @xcite .",
    "environmental disturbance is often one of the dominant noise sources .",
    "seismic vibrations can be transmitted to the cavity spacer via its structural support .",
    "such vibration leads to forces which deform the cavity and change its length .",
    "length fluctuation then acts as a broadband noise source that modulates the laser frequency , resulting in linewidth broadening .",
    "some interesting works have already shown that the sensitivity of the cavity to the environmental mechanical disturbance can be minimized by optimizing cavity geometry and mounting method @xcite .",
    "to verify the achieved laser stability , a standard method is to heterodyne beat the stabilized laser with another similar laser , and take @xmath17 of the combined beat frequency stability as the individual laser stability @xcite .",
    "however , this method is invalid if the two lasers have dissimilar performance levels . to solve this problem ,",
    "we have carried out an experiment to directly characterize the absolute frequency stability of three different reference cavities by simultaneously cross - beating three laser beams that are frequency stabilized to these three reference cavities , following the idea of the `` three - cornered - hat '' method @xcite . in the reported work , only one nd :",
    "yag laser was used to generate three different laser beams that were independently locked to three reference cavities . as a consequence ,",
    "there might still exist an ambiguity in separating common mode noise from individual cavity noise .    in this paper",
    ", we report a much improved experiment that resolves these ambiguities .",
    "the improvement is two - fold : the use of two primary light sources removes common phase noise ; and a vibration insensitive cavity design is implemented that does not even require vibration isolation under normal laboratory seismic conditions . to improve vibration insensitivity of a horizontally placed cavity , special mounting points ( airy points )",
    "are found and a vertical acceleration sensitivity of less than @xmath18 s@xmath19 is achieved . to characterize the frequency stability of this cavity , we use two other different design ultrastable cavities ( cavity @xmath5 and cavity @xmath20 ) , together with the newly designed cavity ( cavity @xmath21 ) , to perform a three - cornered - hat measurement .",
    "all three cavities are coated for a wavelength of @xmath22 nm , whose fourth harmonic at @xmath23 nm is used for ultrahigh resolution spectroscopy of the @xmath11 @xmath12s@xmath13 ",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15p@xmath13 transition of a trapped @xmath10in@xmath7 ion .",
    "cavity 1 and cavity 2 are put on top of two independent active vibration isolation ( avi ) stages , while cavity 3 is only placed on a regular breadboard . in this work , instead of using only one laser source , we use two independent laser sources to suppress the effect of common noise .",
    "two light beams derived from an nd : yag laser are locked to cavity @xmath5 and cavity @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "a diode laser source , placed in another laboratory , is pre - stabilized to a reference cavity , transferred through a fiber link , and then locked to cavity @xmath21 . by cross beating",
    "the three stabilized laser beams simultaneously , the absolute frequency stabilities of the individual cavities are measured .",
    "an absolute frequency stability of @xmath24 at @xmath25 s is observed for cavity @xmath21 , even without vibration control . in classical three - cornered - hat method",
    "the three cavities are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "this hypothesis might not be correct , and can cause the appearance of negative frequency stability in certain cases . in this work , we solve this problem by calculating the covariance matrix of the three beat frequencies .",
    "the results show that correlations do exist between cavities at the time scale from @xmath26 s to @xmath3 s , mainly due to the same experimental surroundings of the three cavities .",
    "since the vibration - insensitive cavity design is central to this paper , a detailed discussion of the cavity design is presented in section @xmath20 .",
    "in addition to the information about the three cavities , this section also describes the frequency locking schemes , and the fiber noise compensation setup .",
    "section @xmath21 presents the experimental results of the three - cornered - hat measurements , including the short term linewidth measurements , and the allan deviations of the cross - beating among the three reference cavities , from which we can deduce the absolute allan deviations of the individual cavities .",
    "we also investigate the correlations of the three cavities , and present the results of absolute , correlation - removed allan deviations of the individual cavities .",
    "the results are summarized in section @xmath27 .",
    "an optical reference cavity serves as the most essential element of an ultra - narrow linewidth laser system . as a consequence , it needs to be isolated from environmental disturbance , such as acoustic noise and mechanical ( seismic ) vibration .",
    "this can be done either by putting the cavity on a vibration isolation stage , or by designing a vibration insensitive cavity , or both . in the present case ,",
    "cavity 1 and cavity 2 are cylindrical design .",
    "they are more sensitive to vibration perturbations , and have to be put on top of vibration isolation stages .",

    "the spacer has a length of approximately @xmath26 cm and an outside diameter of approximately @xmath26 cm .",

    "this result confirms the fact that beat signals are composed of a multitude of independent additive contributions , which as a result of the central limit theorem leads to gaussian statistics .",
    "in conclusion , we have measured the absolute frequency stabilities of three laser beams independently locked to three ultrastable reference cavities , by using both a classical three - cornered - hat method and a modified three - cornered - hat method , where two primary light sources are used to avoid common phase noise .",
    "one of the reference cavities is designed to be vibration insensitive that does not even require vibration isolation under normal laboratory seismic conditions .",
    "our measurements clearly demonstrate that this cavity has the best frequency stability over the entire measurement time from @xmath1 @xmath2s to @xmath3 s. a frequency stability of @xmath24 at @xmath25 s is observed for this cavity , even without vibration isolation .",
    "we further investigate correlations between the reference cavities at different time scales , and observe that correlations between cavities start to appear from @xmath26 s to @xmath3 s according to calculated covariance matrix .",
    "the correlations are mainly caused by the same laboratory surroundings of the three cavities .",
    "an absolute , correlation - removed allan deviation of @xmath4 at @xmath5 s of the newly designed cavity is obtained .",
    "this gives a frequency uncertainty of only @xmath6 hz .",
    "we thank j. stuhler , g. schuricht , and f. lison of toptica photonics for helpful discussions , and r. lalezari of advance thin films for technical suggestions .",
