    "there can be no doubt that the most important development in string theory in recent years is the discovery of d - branes . in flat spacetime a d - brane is regarded as a subspace on which open strings may end . since",
    "string theory modifies classical notions of geometry at short distances , it is natural to assume that such a simple picture of a d - brane as a subspace is too nave for more general backgrounds . a more abstract notion of a d - brane",
    "is required , one which coincides with the notion of a subspace when viewed in the context of only large distances .",
    "the aim of these lectures is to study how this can happen .",
    "it is probably of profound importance in string theory to know a robust definition of d - branes in the most general space - time background , but this problem is far too difficult with our present understanding of string theory . instead we look for the simplest context in which one might observe nontrivial d - brane behaviour .",
    "we render our model as simple as possible by the following steps :    1 .",
    "get rid of the enormous complications introduced by time by using a compactification model .",
    "we will assume our string theory has a target space @xmath1 for some compact space @xmath2 .",
    "we focus our attention on @xmath2 .",
    "2 .   send the string coupling @xmath3 to zero and consider only quantum corrections arising from nonzero @xmath4 effects .",
    "use just as much supersymmetry as we can while keeping the problem nontrivial .",
    "this amounts to an @xmath5 supersymmetric theory on the worldsheet with @xmath2 a  threefold .",
    "4 .   consider only the `` topological sector '' of the worldsheet theory .",
    "this results in a finite - dimensional hilbert space of open strings and we remove all oscillator modes .",
    "as we will see , after such dramatic simplifications , a very rich model remains which requires sophisticated mathematical tools to analyze .",
    "one can only wonder at how abstruse a more realistic d - brane , with the above assumptions removed , must be !",
    "much has already been written about d - branes .",
    "we refer to @xcite , for example , for a review of many aspects of d - branes . in this paper",
    "we chart a slightly different course to usual to achieve our aims .",
    "firstly we try wherever possible to avoid the d - brane world - volume approach since this assumes that the d - brane really is a subspace of the target spacetime .",
    "our ideas are then planted on the worldsheet which forces us to take the string coupling to zero .",
    "having put ourselves in the worldsheet , we will avoid much of the boundary - state formalism that one often employs here . whether this is",
    "a judicious choice is up to the reader to decide , but it does not seem to be of great importance in the context of our discussions .    by restricting attention to the topological sector of @xmath5 worldsheet theories we are in the land of mirror symmetry . in order to keep these lecture notes a manageable length we will have to assume at least some familiarity with mirror symmetry for closed strings .",
    "we refer to the tasi 1996 lectures , and in particular @xcite , for a review .",
    "the more mathematical reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "we will assume a rudimentary knowledge of the geometry of  manifolds .",
    "the reviews @xcite should suffice .    these lectures are primarily intended to review the ideas of the derived category and @xmath0-stability for b - branes .",
    "these subjects have been reviewed by douglas in @xcite from a somewhat different direction than we employ here .",
    "douglas also has a shorter , more mathematically - oriented review in the icm proceedings @xcite . in order to motivate and better understand our constructions",
    ", a good deal of our discussion will also involve mirror symmetry for open strings .",
    "this latter topic has been extensively studied and reviewed in many places .",
    "in particular , the reader can consult @xcite and references therein for a very detailed review of most of the aspects of the subject .",
    "in section [ s : wsc ] we review the basic ideas one needs from topological field theory in the context of closed strings .",
    "this leads into mirror symmetry which will be a central tool in our analysis .",
    "section [ s : bound ] is then a guide to adding boundaries to the string worldsheet . by the end of this section",
    "we will realize that there are some difficulties in maintaining mirror symmetry without broadening our concept of d - branes .",
    "further analysis requires a degree of mathematical sophistication .",
    "we review the algebraic geometry that we require for further progress in section [ s : maths ] .",
    "we would like to claim that only the necessary mathematics has been included here , with no complications introduced for their own sake .",
    "the fact remains however that pretty esoteric notions in cohomology due to grothendieck do seem to be directly applicable to d - brane physics , and so we need to delve fairly deeply into this abstract world .    in section [ s : bcat ]",
    "it is then a straight - forward process to apply the machinery of section [ s : maths ] to the case of b - branes .",
    "we derive the fact that b - branes are described by the derived category of coherent sheaves .",
    "the notion of @xmath0-stability , which is essential in relating the derived category to `` physical '' d - branes , is reviewed in section [ s : stab ] .",
    "much of the motivation for this comes from a - branes and mirror symmetry which we also discuss at length .",
    "finally in section [ s : app ] we give a few examples of the derived category and @xmath0-stability .",
    "let @xmath6 be the string worldsheet .",
    "we consider a field theory based on all possible maps @xmath7 , where @xmath2 is the target manifold .",
    "this  has an action @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a complex coordinate on @xmath6 and @xmath10 are local coordinates for the map @xmath11 .",
    "the letters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are associated with _ real _ coordinates here .",
    "the object @xmath14 may be viewed as a metric on @xmath2 but it does not need to be symmetric for the  to be well - defined . the antisymmetric part of @xmath14 is usually called the `` b - field '' .",
    "this 2-dimensional field theory only defines string theory to an extent .",
    "we know that nonperturbative effects in the string coupling are invisible from this point of view .",
    "since the entire content of these lectures is based on this worldsheet definition of string theory , one must realize that our results are only completely valid in the zero string coupling limit .",
    "assuming @xmath2 is a khler manifold , we may construct the @xmath5 supersymmetric version of the  by adding worldsheet fermions .",
    "we now switch to complex coordinates denoted by @xmath15 and its complex conjugate @xmath16 .",
    "the action is theories .",
    "we are following witten s notation in @xcite where @xmath17 refers to left and right - moving  _ not _ the sign of the @xmath18 charge ! ] @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the khler metric and @xmath21 is a real ( 1,1)-form encoding the b - field degree of freedom .",
    "the fermions are defined as sections of bundles on @xmath6 as follows : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the canonical bundle on @xmath6 , i.e. , the holomorphic cotangent bundle is khler , @xmath24 . ] , @xmath25 is the holomorphic tangent bundle on @xmath2 and bar denotes the corresponding antiholomorphic bundle .",
    "@xmath26 represents the covariant derivative @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the holomorphic part of the de rham differential as usual .",
    "let @xmath29 and assume @xmath30 . in section [ ss",
    ": a ] it will become clear that the ( continuous ) @xmath31-field degree of freedom lies in @xmath32 .",
    "the supersymmetries are given by the following transformations : @xmath33 with fermionic parameters @xmath34 and @xmath35 as sections of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and @xmath38 as sections of @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a  manifold then it is well - known ( see , for example , chapters 3 and 17 of @xcite ) that there will be a metric ( close to the ricci - flat metric if @xmath2 is large ) such that this supersymmetry is extended to an @xmath5 superconformal symmetry .",
    "we restrict to this case from now on .",
    "let us quickly review some basic facts about @xmath5 superconformal field theories for  threefolds in order to fix notation .",
    "we urge the reader to consult other sources ( such as @xcite and chapter 19 of @xcite ) for a fuller account of this important subject if they are not familiar with it .",
    "a closed string state forms a representation of the superconformal algebra .",
    "this is often encoded in the from of an operator product relationship between the generators of the algebra and the vertex operators associated to the closed strings .",
    "the generators of the left - moving algebra are then given by @xmath40 with similar expressions for the right - moving @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "two elements of the superconformal algebra are of interest to us .",
    "the first concerns the generator of dilatations of the worldsheet associated to @xmath45 .",
    "the eigenvalue of this operation is the _ conformal weight _",
    "@xmath46 of a given state .",
    "the second is the charge @xmath47 associated with the @xmath48 r - symmetry of the superconformal algebra associated to @xmath49 . since we have both a left - moving and a right - moving @xmath50 algebra , we have left - moving weight and charge which we denote @xmath46 and @xmath47 , and a right - moving weight and charge which we denote @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the r - symmetry part of the superconformal algebra can essentially be `` factored out '' in the following sense .",
    "the @xmath18 currents can be bosonized using bosons @xmath53 and @xmath54 : @xmath55 if we have a vertex operator in the left - moving sector with charge @xmath47 , then we can essentially write it as @xmath56 where the operator @xmath57 will have charge 0 .",
    "periodic or anti - periodic boundary conditions on the fermions lead to the ramond and neveu - schwarz sectors respectively as usual .",
    "the ns sector has @xmath58 whilst the r sector has @xmath59 .",
    "naturally there are an infinite number of string states in this theory but there is a very interesting finite subset which is of central importance .",
    "unitarity forces certain constraints on the allowed weights and charges . in the ns sector",
    "we have a set of states lying on the boundary of this set of unitary representations which satisfy @xmath60 the operators producing these states from the vacuum are called `` chiral primary '' operators for @xmath61 and `` antichiral primary '' operators for @xmath62 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details . for simplicity of notation",
    "we will usually refer to both the chiral and antichiral operators as chiral .",
    "the key feature of the chiral operators is that they close nicely under the operator product to form the `` chiral algebra '' ( or , less precisely , the `` chiral ring '' ) .",
    "this finite - dimensional subalgebra of the full infinite - dimensional algebra of closed string vertex operators seems to encompass a good deal of information about the full superconformal field theory .",
    "it is best analyzed using methods of topological field theory as we will see in the following sections .",
    "one may also use methods of `` gauged linear sigma models '' as pioneered in @xcite .",
    "indeed , linear sigma models may be used to analyze open strings and d - branes as in @xcite .",
    "we will not pursue the linear sigma model in these lectures .",
    "an operator in the ramond sector of particular interest is the `` spectral flow operator '' with @xmath63 : @xmath64 this has an operator product expansion with itself as @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the chiral primary operator with @xmath67 and @xmath68 is the ( 3,0)-form on @xmath2 which is unique up to normalization .",
    "the spectral flow operator is responsible for _ spacetime _ supersymmetry .",
    "again we refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "note that we have two spectral flow operators , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which give us @xmath50 supersymmetry in the uncompactified spacetime directions .",
    "the chiral algebra is best studied by passing to a topological field theory associated to the @xmath5 superconformal field theory described in section [ ss : nlsm ] .",
    "there are two topological field theories that naturally occur this way  the `` a model '' and the `` b model '' discovered by witten @xcite which we now review .",
    "we will generally denote the target space for the a - model by @xmath71 , and use @xmath2 as the target space of the b - model .",
    "we `` twist '' the superconformal field theory by modifying the bundles in which the fermions take values .",
    "we set @xmath72 note that the action ( [ eq : scft ] ) still makes sense ( i.e. , it is invariant under rotations of the worldsheet ) with this assignment .",
    "the `` supersymmetry '' ( [ eq : n2susy ] ) still holds but notice that the four @xmath73 parameters are no longer worldsheet spinors .",
    "we consider a restricted version of this symmetry by setting @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "that is , we have a symmetry depending on a single scalar parameter @xmath73 .",
    "let us also denote the operator which generates this symmetry @xmath76 . to be precise , @xmath77 for any operator @xmath78 .",
    "it follows that ( up to equations of motion ) @xmath79 in other words , @xmath76 generates a `` brst symmetry '' .",
    "furthermore , we may write the action in a simplified form ( where @xmath4 has been chosen suitably ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 is the complexified khler form .",
    "the next step is to restrict attention only to operators @xmath78 , which are @xmath76-closed , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "the effect of the twisting ( [ eq : atwist ] ) is to mix the notion of weight @xmath46 and @xmath18-charge @xmath47 from the original untwisted superconformal field theory .",
    "it follows that by restricting to @xmath76-closed states we are effectively restricting attention to the case @xmath84 .",
    "that is , to a particular chiral algebra .    now , suppose we have an operator @xmath78 which is @xmath76-exact in the sense that @xmath85 for some @xmath86 . by standard methods one can show that any correlation function involving this operator and other @xmath76-closed operators will vanish .",
    "in other words , a @xmath76-exact operator is equivalent to zero in the chiral algebra .",
    "the reason we have put this statement in a pretentious little box is that it is the most important mathematical statement in these lectures .",
    "the fact that cohomology is essential will lead to a proliferation of homological algebra in the later lectures .",
    "note that the triviality of @xmath76-exactness extends to the action too .",
    "that is , under the shift @xmath87 , correlation functions are invariant .",
    "one can show that a change in the worldsheet metric leads to a @xmath76-exact shift in the action ( [ eq : aact ] ) .",
    "this means that the location of the vertex operators on the worldsheet are not important ( assuming the locations are distinct of course ) when computing the correlation functions .",
    "the action ( [ eq : aact ] ) manifestly depends on the complexified khler form but any change in complex structure merely changes @xmath88 and is thus trivial .",
    "so the correlation functions in this topological a - model depend only on the complexified khler form @xmath89 .",
    "furthermore it is manifest from the action that it is only the cohomology class of @xmath89 that is of importance , and that a shift in @xmath31 by an element of integral cohomology will not affect the correlation functions .",
    "operators will be general functions of the fields @xmath11 and @xmath90 .",
    "we first consider `` local operators '' in @xmath6 , i.e. , scalars .",
    "this means we can not use @xmath91 or @xmath92 as they are 1-forms on @xmath6 .",
    "a basis for the vector space of local operators is therefore given by operators of the form @xmath93 where @xmath94 is a @xmath95-form on @xmath71 .",
    "the @xmath96 s represent real indices  in other words they may be holomorphic or antiholomorphic .",
    "one can then compute @xmath97 that is , for the a - model , * @xmath76-cohomology is de rham cohomology * and the space of operators is given by @xmath98 .",
    "let us now address the question of how we might compute a correlation function between such operators : @xmath99 the fact that the action ( [ eq : aact ] ) splits naturally into two pieces makes life particularly easy when analyzing the space of all maps @xmath100 .",
    "let us assume @xmath6 is a sphere .",
    "the space of all maps then breaks up into connected components corresponding to elements of @xmath101 . on a given component",
    "the second term in the action ( [ eq : aact ] ) is constant and can be pulled out of the path integral .",
    "the term in the action that remains is @xmath76-exact and is therefore trivial .",
    "although one s first temptation might be to replace something that is trivial by zero , we do the opposite and rescale it by a factor that tends to infinity !",
    "then the fact that this integrand is positive semi - definite means that we effectively restrict the path integral to maps @xmath11 where this part of the action is zero . these are `` worldsheet instantons '' . in other words ,",
    "the saddle - point approximation of instantons is exact for topological field theories .",
    "the worldsheet instantons are given by @xmath102 in ( [ eq : av ] ) .",
    "these are _ holomorphic maps _ @xmath103 .",
    "the infinite - dimensional space of all maps @xmath100 is therefore replaced by the finite - dimensional space of holomorphic maps when we perform the path integral .",
    "supersymmetry then cancels the pfaffians associated with the fermionic path integral and the remaining determinants from the @xmath11 integrals .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on this cancellation process .",
    "we focus on the @xmath95-forms for @xmath95 even since the odd forms do not directly correspond to operators in the untwisted superconformal field theory .",
    "the 0-form clearly represents the identity operator .",
    "the simplest case is therefore to consider correlation functions between operators associated to 2-forms .",
    "one can show that @xmath104 where @xmath12 is the set of instantons and @xmath105 are integers given by the intersection theory on the moduli space of rational curves ( i.e. , holomorphic embeddings of @xmath6 ) in @xmath71 , including the possibility of multiple covers @xcite .",
    "the knowledge of these correlation functions between 2-forms is sufficient to define an algebra ( i.e. , multiplicative ) structure on @xmath106 .",
    "this is equivalent to the operator algebra . in the large radius limit , where @xmath107 , this coincides with the cohomology ring given by the wedge product . at finite volume",
    "the deformed ring is called the `` quantum cohomology ring '' of @xmath71 .",
    "we have impinged on a vast subject here which we do not have space to explore more fully .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for a more detailed account of this important subject together with more recent developments .",
    "the operator algebra is graded by the degree of the forms .",
    "viewing @xmath76 as a generator of a brst symmetry we can also refer to the grading as a `` ghost number '' .",
    "that is , if @xmath108 is a @xmath95-form then the operator @xmath109 has ghost number @xmath95 .",
    "the ghost number maps naturally back to the @xmath18 charges in the untwisted theory . in this case",
    "@xmath109 would map to an operator with @xmath110 .",
    "note also that the correlation function of a product of operators is only nonzero if the total ghost number is 6 .",
    "this means that the grading of the operator algebra is preserved under multiplication mod 6 .",
    "an important aspect of the a - model for our purposes concerns deformations of the theory .",
    "an operator within the theory may be used to deform the lagrangian density if it makes sense to integrate such an operator over @xmath6 to deform the action . to find such operators we need to look beyond the local operators considered so far .",
    "suppose @xmath109 is a local operator with ghost number @xmath95 .",
    "the operator @xmath111 ( where `` @xmath112 '' is the _ worldsheet _ de rham operator ) will have trivial correlation functions with other operators since the location of the vertex operator insertions is unimportant .",
    "it follows that it must be @xmath76-exact , i.e. , @xmath113 for some operator @xmath114 with ghost number @xmath115 .",
    "we may repeat this process again by setting @xmath116 for some operator @xmath117 with ghost number @xmath118 .",
    "but @xmath117 is a 2-form and so we can naturally integrate it over @xmath6 . we may therefore consider a deformation of the theory given by @xmath119 for some infinitesimal @xmath120 . in order to preserve the grading of the operator algebra given by the ghost number , the deformation of the action should have ghost number zero , i.e. , @xmath121 .",
    "it is not hard to see that this deformation of the field theory corresponds to deforming @xmath89 by a 2-form proportional to @xmath122 . since the only dependence of the a - model was on @xmath89",
    ", we see that we have described all the deformations of the a - model .",
    "( other deformations that violate ghost number conservation were considered in @xcite . )",
    "it is important to realize that the topological a - model is a different quantum field theory to the original @xmath5 superconformal field theory . even though the vector space of primary chiral operators is naturally a subspace of the infinite - dimensional space of operators in the untwisted theory",
    ", the operator products may be quite different .",
    "there is an exception however .",
    "if the worldsheet is flat then the twisting has no affect .",
    "if the @xmath5 were used to compactify a heterotic string ( rather than the type ii strings we consider in these lectures ) then the products which determine the effective superpotential of the resulting @xmath123 theory in four dimensions are unchanged in the topological field theory .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "we emphasize again that the structure of the operator algebra depends only upon @xmath89 and not the complex structure of @xmath71 .",
    "in fact , as explored in @xcite , we do nt need any complex structure on @xmath71 , nor do we require the  condition .",
    "@xmath71 can be any symplectic manifold with a compatible almost complex structure .",
    "instantons then correspond to pseudo - holomorphic curves .",
    "since the topological a - model knows about only a small subset of the data of the untwisted theory , it should not come as a surprise that it can be applied to a wider class of target spaces .    in this section we considered a _",
    "fixed _ worldsheet of genus zero mapping into @xmath71 .",
    "if higher genera are considered , the a - model becomes fairly trivial because of ghost number conservation constraints .",
    "a variant of the a - model that is commonly considered consists of coupling the worldsheet theory to gravity .",
    "in other words one includes all metrics on @xmath6 in the path integral .",
    "such a theory now contains nontrivial information about higher genus worldsheets as discovered in @xcite .",
    "this `` topological gravity '' is also important in the `` large n '' duality of @xcite .    if we were going to do a full treatment of mirror symmetry for open strings we would certainly have to wade into many of the technicalities of the a - model coupled to gravity .",
    "however , in these lectures , which focus on the issues of stability , we can get away with largely ignoring this topic",
    ".      we may relabel the fermions in the superconformal field theory in a different way to obtain the `` b - model '' which was also introduced by witten @xcite .",
    "let @xmath124 be sections of @xmath125 , while @xmath126 is a section of @xmath127 and @xmath128 is a section of @xmath129 .",
    "define scalars @xmath130 and define a 1-form @xmath131 with @xmath132-form part given by @xmath133 and @xmath134-form part given by @xmath135 .    now consider a variation corresponding to the original supersymmetric variation with @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "as in the a - model , this produces a brst - like variation @xmath76 satisfying @xmath138 ( up to equations of motion ) .",
    "now , for a suitable choice of @xmath4 , we may rewrite the action in the form @xmath139 where @xmath140    an additional complication arises in the b - model because the fermions are twisted in a more asymmetric fashion than in the a - model . for a general target",
    "space @xmath2 one has a chiral anomaly associated with a problem properly defining the phase of the pfaffian associated to the fermionic path integrals .",
    "this anomaly is zero if we require @xmath141 , i.e. , if @xmath2 is a  manifold .",
    "it is not immediately obvious from ( [ eq : sb ] ) but @xmath142 depends only upon the complex structure of @xmath2 .",
    "it is independent of both the metric on @xmath6 and the complexified khler form on @xmath2 , @xmath89 .",
    "thus the correlation functions have a similar independence .",
    "local observables are now written @xmath143 where @xmath144 is a @xmath145-form on @xmath2 valued in @xmath146 .",
    "one might call @xmath147 a `` @xmath148-form '' . note that we can use contraction with the holomorphic 3-form @xmath149 to give an isomorphism between the spaces of @xmath148-forms and @xmath150-forms .",
    "this isomorphism is often used implicitly and explicitly in discussions of mirror symmetry as we will see in section [ ss : mir ] .",
    "now , @xmath151 and so , for the b - model , * @xmath76-cohomology is dolbeault cohomology * on forms valued in exterior powers of the holomorphic tangent bundle .",
    "the instantons in the b - model are trivial .",
    "setting @xmath102 in ( [ eq : sb ] ) requires @xmath152 , i.e. , @xmath11 is a constant map mapping @xmath6 to a point in @xmath2 .",
    "thus the correlation functions do not consist of some infinite sum .",
    "the generators of the operator algebra of interest in the b - model are given by @xmath153-forms .",
    "the three - point functions can be shown to be @xmath154 where @xmath155 etc .",
    "the object @xmath156 can be obtained from the antiholomorphic 3-form @xmath157 using the khler metric to raise indices .",
    "a @xmath158-form in the b - model has ghost number @xmath159 and maps to an operator with @xmath160 in the untwisted model .",
    "just as in the a - model we may consider deforming the theory by adding operators to the lagrangian density .",
    "this time such operators correspond to @xmath153-forms , i.e. , elements of @xmath161 .",
    "that this cohomology group corresponds to deformations of complex structure of @xmath2 is well - known ( see chapter 15 of @xcite for a nice account of this ) .",
    "note that the b - model does require that @xmath2 has a complex structure and that it be .",
    "however , it does not require any mention of @xmath89 .",
    "this means that the b - model requires only `` algebraic '' knowledge of @xmath2 in the following sense .",
    "suppose that @xmath2 is an `` algebraic variety '' i.e. , a subspace of @xmath162 defined by the intersection of various ( homogeneous ) equations @xmath163 in the homogeneous coordinates .",
    "then the b - model is defined completely by the equations @xmath164    the fact that the b - model has no instanton corrections together with the above algebraic nature means that one should think of the b - model as being the `` easy '' topological field theory and the a - model as the `` difficult '' theory .",
    "when we discuss open strings in section [ s : bcat ] the reader may decide that the b - model is not so `` easy '' after all but no one can deny that it is a good deal easier than the a - model !",
    "there are several definitions of mirror symmetry varying in strength .",
    "we require only a fairly weak definition which asserts that two  threefolds @xmath2 and @xmath71 are mirror if the operator algebra of the a - model with target space @xmath71 is isomorphic to the operator algebra of the b - model with target space @xmath2 .",
    "the original definition is stronger and is a statement concerning conformal field theories .",
    "the strongest definition would be that the type iia string compactified on @xmath71 yields `` isomorphic '' physics in four dimensions to the type iib string compactified on @xmath2 .",
    "a simple analysis of the dimensions of the vector spaces of the operator algebra yields the simple statement that @xmath165 and thus @xmath166 .",
    "the operator algebra for the a - model on @xmath71 depends on a choice of @xmath89 on @xmath71 and the operator algebra for the b - model on @xmath2 depends on a choice of complex structure for @xmath2 .",
    "thus a precise statement of mirror symmetry must map the moduli space of @xmath89 of @xmath71 to the moduli space of complex structures of @xmath2 .",
    "this mapping is called the `` mirror map '' and we now discuss it in some detail for a simple key example .",
    "let us introduce the most - studied example of a mirror pair of threefolds following @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 is the ",
    "quintic threefold , i.e. , defined as a hypersurface in @xmath167 given by the vanishing of an equation of degree 5 in the homogeneous coordinates . since @xmath168 , the moduli space of complexified khler classes is only one - dimensional .",
    "let @xmath169 denote the positive .",
    "] generator of @xmath170 .",
    "then , by an abuse of the notation , we will refer to the cohomology class of the complexified khler form as @xmath171 , i.e. , @xmath31 and @xmath13 are real numbers in the context of the quintic .",
    "basically we can think of the size of @xmath71 ( i.e. , @xmath13 ) being determined purely by the size of the ambient @xmath167 .",
    "@xmath71 has @xmath172 and thus 101 deformations of complex structure but this is of no interest to us here .",
    "the mirror @xmath2 of the quintic is constructed by dividing @xmath71 by a @xmath173 orbifold action .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a review of why this orbifold yields the mirror .",
    "@xmath71 has orbifold singularities which should be resolved yielding many degrees of freedom for @xmath89 . however , all we care about is the complex structure of @xmath2 which may be defined by specifying the exact quintic polynomial used .",
    "the most general quintic compatible with the @xmath173 orbifold action is given by @xmath174 thus the complex structure is determined by the single complex parameter @xmath90 .",
    "the mirror map we desire will be a mapping between @xmath89 on the a - model side and @xmath90 on the b - model side .",
    "this map turns out to be quite complicated and is actually a many - to - many mapping .    because the mirror map is not globally well - defined one generally starts with a basepoint , which is usually the large radius limit on the a - model side , and finds the mirror map in some neighbourhood of this basepoint .",
    "one can then try to analytically continue the mirror map to a larger region .",
    "one may analyze the moduli space intrinsically without any reference to a specific compactification by studying the general features of scalar fields in @xmath50 theories of supergravity in four dimensions .",
    "the result is that the moduli space is a so - called `` special khler manifold '' @xcite .",
    "for a nice mathematical treatment of this subject see @xcite .",
    "the special khler structure of the moduli space leads to the existence of favoured ( but no uniquely defined ) coordinates , the `` special coordinates '' which obey certain flatness constraints . on the a - model side , the components of @xmath89 form such special coordinates . on the b - model side ,",
    "the natural complex parameters such as @xmath90 in ( [ eq : qm ] ) do _ not _ form special coordinates . instead",
    ", the special coordinates are formed from _ periods _ as follows .",
    "let @xmath175 for @xmath176 form a symplectic basis of @xmath177 in the sense that we have the following intersection numbers @xmath178 a `` period '' of the holomorphic 3-form @xmath179 is not intrinsically defined as we may rescale @xmath149 by a constant .",
    "however , _ ratios _ of periods , @xmath180 for @xmath181 are well - defined .",
    "these ratios do form special coordinates and these are naturally mapped to components of @xmath89 by the mirror map .",
    "to find exactly which periods are mapped to which components of @xmath89 one looks at the monodromy of these coordinates around the large radius limit induced by the symmetry @xmath182 .",
    "a systematic method for doing this was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "the criteria we have described so far almost determines the mirror map uniquely . to nail down the last constants one really needs to explicitly count some rational curves on @xmath71 and",
    "map the correlation functions of the a - model to that of the b - model directly .",
    "having said that , there is a conjectured form of the mirror map ( which was implicitly used in @xcite ) which appears to work in all known cases .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "let s see how all this works for the case of the quintic .",
    "we first need to find the relationship between the periods of @xmath2 and the parameter @xmath90 .",
    "this relationship is encoded in a differential equation called the `` picard  fuchs '' equation .",
    "this is a differential equation whose solutions are the periods ( [ eq : per ] ) .",
    "there are various ways of deriving this equation .",
    "a fairly tortuous method was originally pursued in @xcite with a more direct way discussed in @xcite .",
    "the nicest method was given in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) in terms of toric geometry .",
    "first introduce a coordinate @xmath183 on the b - model moduli space .",
    "the method of @xcite yields a differential equation @xmath184 expanding around @xmath185 we obtain a basis of solutions in the following form : @xmath186 the monodromy of this set of solutions around @xmath185 is precisely the right form to be associated with the large radius limit @xmath187 on the a - model side @xcite .",
    "the mirror map is then given by @xmath188    ( 100,100 ) , ( 50,-1)*b , ( 2,50)*j ( 70,40)**+!cl@(l , r ) , ( 51.9,37 ) * ( 85,74)**+=``y''!cl=``x''@(l , r ) , ( 66.8,60.7 ) * `` x''@(l , r)(36.7,60.7 ) * `` y''!cd@-@(d , r)(80,30)=``y '' `` y''@(l , r)(62.5,24.2 )",
    "* `` y''@(l , u)(51.7,20 ) * `` y''@(l , u)(41.1,24.2 ) *    there are three points of particular interest in the moduli space where the picard - fuchs equation becomes singular .",
    "as we have just stated , the point @xmath185 corresponds to the large radius limit .",
    "the point @xmath189 ( or @xmath190 ) corresponds to the `` gepner model '' @xcite .",
    "it may also be interpreted as a @xmath191-orbifold of the  theory @xcite .",
    "the solutions to the picard ",
    "fuchs equation have a branch point of order 5 at this point .",
    "finally there is a singularity at @xmath192 ( or @xmath193 ) usually referred to as the `` conifold '' point .    a nice way to visualize",
    "the mirror map is to plot fundamental regions of the moduli space in the @xmath194-plane . to do this",
    "we put branch cuts along @xmath195 for real @xmath196 and @xmath197 . in figure",
    "[ f : scorp ] we show the `` scorpion '' diagram from @xcite which shows five fundamental regions .",
    "these consist of the one containing the large radius limit in the region @xmath198 together with 4 other fundamental regions obtained by analytically continuing around the gepner point .",
    "it is very important to note that the fundamental regions do not tesselate in general .",
    "monodromy around the large radius limit induces a shift @xmath182 and it is clear from figure [ f : scorp ] that such shifts cause overlaps between fundamental regions .",
    "if we stick to the region containing the large radius limit we see that the gepner point represents the `` smallest '' possible quintic threefold . for further discussion of minimal sizes in this context see @xcite",
    ".    a more typical example of a mirror pair will require analysis of moduli spaces of more than one complex dimension .",
    "this makes the problem a good deal more complicated than the quintic but we do not require any more basic concepts to solve this problem .",
    "the picard ",
    "fuchs equations are now a set of simultaneous linear partial differential equations .",
    "we refer to @xcite , for example , for an efficient way of dealing with this situation .",
    "in this section we consider a worldsheet @xmath6 with boundaries . a careful analysis of this gets quite technical quite quickly , taking us beyond where we need to be for these talks .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite ( and also @xcite for the most thorough treatment .",
    "one should also consult @xcite which is based on the analysis of @xcite . in the following",
    "we will make rough and ready assumptions which are quite adequate for our purposes .      as stated earlier",
    "one of the main purposes of these lectures is to demonstrate the existence of d - branes which do not correspond simply to subspaces . despite this",
    ", we will initially assume that d - branes _ are _ subspaces .",
    "thus we assume that we have a collection of subspaces @xmath199 and that our maps @xmath100 obey the condition @xmath200 i.e. , the open strings end on the d - branes @xmath201 .",
    "we have not yet constrained the dimensions of the d - branes and one might be free to consider the case that one of the @xmath201 s fills @xmath71 in which case we have imposed no condition at all .",
    "a d - brane that can appear in the a - model will have to satisfy certain constraints which we now discuss .",
    "such a d - brane is called an `` a - brane '' .",
    "the first step is to apply the variational principle to the problem . applying a variation of the fields and",
    "then integrating by parts divides the variation of the action into two parts  the bulk and the boundary . setting the variation of the bulk to zero yields the euler ",
    "lagrange equations in the usual way . demanding that the variation of the boundary is zero",
    "imposes further conditions .    in flat space the vanishing of the variation of the boundary imposes either dirichlet or neumann conditions for the fields @xmath10 ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "more generally @xcite we set @xmath202 where @xmath203 is a matrix orthogonal with respect to the metric @xmath14 .",
    "eigenvectors of @xmath203 with eigenvalue @xmath204 give dirichlet conditions and are thus associated with directions normal to @xmath205 .",
    "to be completely general , one need not assume that directions tangent to the d - branes are associated to eigenvectors with eigenvalue @xmath206 @xcite , but for our purposes we may make this assumption .",
    "it is impossible to preserve all the @xmath5 supersymmetry of section [ ss : nlsm ] once @xmath6 has a boundary .",
    "this is because we must have a reflection condition at the boundary which mixes the left - moving and right - moving fermions .",
    "the best we can do is use the same reflection matrix as above : @xmath207 now , referring to the a - model twist of ( [ eq : atwist ] ) , such a reflection only really makes sense in the a - model if @xmath208 when we use holomorphic coordinates .",
    "that is , only the off - diagonal terms @xmath209 and @xmath210 are nonzero .",
    "now choose a vector @xmath211 which has eigenvalue @xmath206 with respect to @xmath203 , i.e. , a tangent vector in the d - brane .",
    "let us introduce the almost complex structure @xmath13 , which in holomorphic coordinates is of the form @xmath212 with off - diagonal entries equal to zero .",
    "it is then easy to see that the vector @xmath213 has eigenvector @xmath204 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath214 , so a further application of @xmath13 restores us to the tangent direction .",
    "thus @xmath13 exchanges the directions tangent and normal to the d - brane @xmath205",
    ". clearly then @xmath205 must be of middle dimension , i.e. , real dimension 3 .",
    "note that if @xmath211 and @xmath215 are two tangent vectors in @xmath205 with eigenvalue @xmath206 under @xmath203 , then @xmath215 is orthogonal to @xmath213 with respect to the metric @xmath14 .",
    "since , by definition , the khler form on @xmath71 is @xmath216 , we see that the khler form restricted to @xmath205 is zero",
    ".    a middle - dimensional manifold on which the khler form restricts to zero is called a _",
    "lagrangian submanifold_. thus we have argued that the simplest d - branes compatible with the a - model twist appear to consist of lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "there are further constraints which we discuss shortly .",
    "a more careful analysis @xcite shows that a @xmath217-fold may have `` coisotropic '' submanifolds of real dimension @xmath218 for non - negative integer @xmath95 .",
    "such submanifolds will be of no interest to us in the case of  threefolds since @xmath219 so long as the holonomy is not a proper subgroup of @xmath220 .",
    "thus far we have taken care of the analysis of the theory that pertains to the metric .",
    "we should also consider the effect of the boundary on the @xmath31-field .    when @xmath6 had no boundary , it was apparent from the a - model action ( [ eq : aact ] ) that only the cohomology class of @xmath31 affected any correlation functions .",
    "this is no longer true when @xmath6 has a boundary and so there are more degrees of freedom associated to the @xmath31-field than would arise from @xmath221 .",
    "naturally these degrees of freedom must be associated to the boundary and so should show up in the d - brane .",
    "this extra freedom may be written in the guise of 1-form @xmath147 on @xmath71 and an addition of a term @xmath222 to the action . in order to maintain supersymmetry and/or brst invariance",
    "it is also necessary to add some terms involving fermions to this boundary contribution .",
    "a shift of the @xmath31-field by an exact 2-form @xmath223 is then an invariance of the theory if it is accompanied by a shift @xmath224 .",
    "thus , with this symmetry understood , the @xmath31-field is restored to living in @xmath221 and we have a new parameter @xmath147 . setting @xmath225 , we note that @xmath226 is invariant under the @xmath227-symmetry and thus , unlike @xmath31 or @xmath228 alone , can be a physically meaningful parameter .",
    "it is also important to realize that the theory is no longer invariant under a lone shift of the @xmath31-field by an integral 2-form .",
    "an invariance is obtained by accompanying such a shift by a similar shift in @xmath228 .",
    "we will see this effect clearly in section [ sss : qmon ] .",
    "typically one thinks of @xmath147 as the connection on a @xmath18-bundle associated to the boundary of @xmath6 in the form of `` chan  paton '' factors .    like the @xmath31-field , the only contribution from @xmath147 to the correlation functions will arise from worldsheet instantons .",
    "as in section [ ss : a ] , worldsheet instantons correspond to holomorphic maps of @xmath6 into @xmath71 .",
    "the action of such an instanton will receive a contribution from ( [ eq : sa ] ) in the form of a line integral of @xmath147 around the boundary of @xmath6 in the d - brane @xmath205 . as this integral contains only directions tangent to @xmath205 , it is only the projection of @xmath147 into the cotangent bundle of @xmath205 that matters .",
    "thus the @xmath18-bundle may be considered as living purely on the d - brane even though we defined @xmath147 as living in the cotangent bundle of @xmath71 .    to derive this notion that @xmath147 is a connection one should really follow the `` gerbe '' description of the @xmath31-field @xcite .",
    "we will not attempt to do this here . as we will do later ,",
    "one is free to associate larger gauge groups than @xmath18 to the d - branes .",
    "one should always be aware , however , that there is a natural diagonal @xmath18 in this gauge group which is associated to the @xmath31-field by the @xmath227 symmetry .",
    "the condition that the brst symmetry ( or supersymmetry of the untwisted theory ) is preserved puts a condition on the connection @xmath147 . in the case that @xmath229 one can show @xcite that @xmath230 , i.e. , the connection must be flat .",
    "we will generally restrict to this case .",
    "the statement that an a - brane consists of a lagrangian submanifold with a flat bundle is a purely classical statement .",
    "quantum considerations impose two further constraints .",
    "the first arises due to an anomaly .",
    "we would like to preserve the ghost number grading of the operator product algebra once we include a - branes .",
    "it turns out that an arbitrary lagrangian submanifold can break this symmetry which , in physics language , is due to an anomaly .    this anomaly is carefully analyzed in chapter 40 of @xcite and is tied to the problem of grading floer cohomology @xcite . since this subject is rather technical we will simply state the result here .",
    "let us fix a particular choice of a holomorphic 3-form @xmath149 on @xmath71 .",
    "at any point @xmath95 on a lagrangian submanifold @xmath205 the volume form of @xmath205 may be written as a restriction @xmath231 where @xmath203 is a positive real number .",
    "@xmath232 gives a map from @xmath205 to a circle @xmath233 .",
    "this in turn induces a map on the fundamental group @xmath234 known as the `` maslov class '' of @xmath205 .",
    "the anomaly is absent precisely when the maslov class of @xmath205 is zero .",
    "clearly this is always the case when @xmath235 . for a nontrivial example we can picture , consider the case where @xmath71 is a one - complex - dimensional torus .",
    "any line of @xmath71 is trivially lagrangian .",
    "as shown in figure  [ f : tmaz ] , a contractible loop has a nontrivial maslov class and so is ruled out as an a - brane .    the second condition on a - branes which arises from quantum effects concerns destabilizing from open string tadpoles .",
    "this requires knowledge about the open string states to which we now turn .",
    "the hilbert space of closed string states in the a - model is unaffected by the presence of a - branes and is still given by the de rham cohomology of @xmath71 .",
    "in addition we need to consider open strings stretching between two d - branes .",
    "clearly there are two possibilities :    1 .",
    "the ends of the open string may lie on the same d - brane .",
    "2 .   the string stretches between two distinct d - branes .",
    "these two cases are best analyzed differently .",
    "the first case was analyzed by witten in @xcite .",
    "suppose we have a lagrangian cycle @xmath205 with a @xmath236 vector bundle @xmath237 .",
    "by the usual methods of chan ",
    "paton factors @xcite , the open strings will lie in the set @xmath238 , i.e. , endomorphisms of @xmath239 . in the case of a line bundle",
    "we simply have @xmath240 .",
    "@xmath76-invariance allows us to take a scaling limit @xcite effectively taking the string tension to infinity , which implies that the open string states are only associated with constant maps @xmath11 and the fermions take values in the tangent bundle of @xmath205 .",
    "thus , local operators corresponding to the insertion of open string states on the boundary of @xmath6 which maps to @xmath205 are given by objects of the form @xmath241 where @xmath242 , @xmath243 , and @xmath244 lies in the tangent bundle of @xmath205 .",
    "the brst operator @xmath76 acts similarly to section [ ss : a ] and so the hilbert space of open string states is given by the total de rham cohomology group @xmath245 where the ghost number is given by @xmath217 .",
    "the discussion of deformations of the theory induced by operators in section [ ss : a ] applies similarly to boundary states .",
    "one difference is that the deforming operator will naturally be integrated along the one - dimensional @xmath246 rather than the two - dimensional @xmath6 .",
    "thus we look for ghost number _",
    "one _ boundary operators to give the deformation .",
    "these correspond to elements of @xmath247 .",
    "it is interesting to explicitly match these deformations coming from open string vertex operators to the parameters that define the a - model .",
    "first we note that the number of deformations of the connection on a flat vector bundle are given by @xmath248 as shown in chapter 15 of @xcite for example .",
    "note that to count degrees of freedom correctly we restrict to a _ real form _ of the gauge group . since our open string operators are complex - valued , these deformations of the connection @xmath147 account for exactly half of the degrees of freedom present in @xmath247 .",
    "so what do the other half of the deformations correspond to ?",
    "clearly deformations of @xmath205 itself should correspond to deformations of the a - model . we will now show that such deformations indeed account for the remaining degrees of freedom .",
    "let us assume initially the minimal case , i.e. , that @xmath239 is a line bundle .",
    "a deformation of @xmath205 corresponds to a section of the normal bundle of @xmath205 .",
    "we saw in section [ sss : aopen1 ] that the khler form provides a perfect pairing between vectors normal to @xmath205 and vectors tangent to @xmath205 .",
    "we may thus use the khler form to provide a one - to - one mapping between sections of the normal bundle of @xmath205 and sections of the cotangent bundle of @xmath205 .",
    "thus a deformation is given by a 1-form on @xmath205 .",
    "of course , we would like the deformed submanifold to still be lagrangian .",
    "a simple calculation reveals that this condition dictates that the 1-form on @xmath205 be closed .",
    "the result is that lagrangian deformations of @xmath205 are in one - to - one correspondence with closed 1-forms on @xmath205 .",
    "in contrast , the degrees of freedom coming from the a - model consist of _ cohomology classes _ of 1-forms on @xmath205 .",
    "thus , if a deformation of @xmath205 corresponds to a 1-form which is exact , then it does not affect the a - model .",
    "such a deformation is called a `` hamiltonian '' deformation of @xmath205 .",
    "thus we see that a - branes are really only defined up to hamiltonian deformation .",
    "if the rank of @xmath239 is greater than one then some of the deformations of @xmath205 corresponding to @xmath247 are associated to breaking @xmath205 up into a collection of branes with bundles of lower rank .",
    "this all ties together with the picture of enhanced gauge symmetry for coincident d - branes as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we should therefore think of the generic a - brane as comprising of a line bundle @xmath237 with higher rank bundles obtained by allowing such basic a - branes to coalesce .",
    "there is one more piece of information about the properties of a - branes that the open strings in @xmath247 can tell us .",
    "if an a - brane background defines a truly stable vacuum for the topological a - model then the one - point function @xmath249 will be zero for any vertex operator associated with @xmath247 . a nonzero value ,",
    "called a `` tadpole '' , would force the operator to acquire an expectation value which would move the d - brane to another location .",
    "we therefore need to know how to compute @xmath249 exactly .",
    "fortunately witten @xcite discovered a beautiful way of computing all the correlation functions between open string operators associated to @xmath247 .    without instanton corrections ,",
    "witten showed that the correlation functions could be determined by a chern ",
    "simons field theory on the lagrangian @xmath205 .",
    "the effect of instantons is to add an additional term into the action . at tree level",
    "an instanton will consist of a holomorphic map of a disk into @xmath71 with the boundary of the disk mapped to @xmath205 .",
    "it is this instanton contribution to the effective action that has the potential to generate tadpoles @xmath249 . restricting to the case of a line bundle",
    ", the condition that such tadpoles vanish is that @xmath250=0    \\quad\\hbox{in $ h_1(l)$ , }    \\label{eq : tadpole}\\ ] ] where the sum is over all holomorphic disks @xmath251 with @xmath252 ( including multiple covers ) .",
    "the notation @xmath253 $ ] refers to the cohomology class of @xmath254 .",
    "it is an interesting exercise to show that ( [ eq : tadpole ] ) is invariant under hamiltonian deformations of @xmath205 .",
    "any lagrangian violating ( [ eq : tadpole ] ) should not be considered to be an a - brane .",
    "this condition on a - branes has been explored in some cases ( in @xcite for example ) but a general geometric understanding appears to be missing .",
    "for example , it is not known if the 3-torus fibrations of syz @xcite satisfy this condition .",
    "note that the condition ( [ eq : tadpole ] ) depends on @xmath89 and the value of the connection @xmath147 .",
    "thus there can be a - branes which are good for a specific value of these parameters but will , in general , be killed by tadpoles .",
    "note also that an @xmath255 , which is simply - connected , always trivially satisfies the vanishing tadpole condition .",
    "it is worth summarizing the definition of an a - brane that we have finally settled on :    although we will be doing our best to evade the issue , we really should mention the @xmath256-algebra structure associated to the a - branes .",
    "the correlation functions for the open string vertex operators which arise from witten s chern  simons theory are not consistent with an associative algebra in the usual way .",
    "instead one defines a series of products @xmath257 for which @xmath258 would be the usual product .",
    "these higher products are related in a specific way .",
    "we refer to @xcite , for example , for more details .",
    "the recent paper @xcite explains carefully how the @xmath256 structure appears directly in the topological field theory .",
    "suppose we have a set of a - branes @xmath201 .",
    "for simplicity of exposition , let us initially assume that we just have line bundles over each brane .",
    "given a pair of a - branes @xmath201 and @xmath259 we will have a hilbert space of open strings beginning on @xmath201 and ending on @xmath259 .",
    "this hilbert space has a grading , which , up to an additive shift is the ghost number .",
    "this additive shift will turn out to be very important and we will discuss it extensively soon .",
    "we use the following notation for this graded hilbert space : @xmath260 we will also denote @xmath261 simply by @xmath262 .",
    "the reason for this notation is that the concept of open strings between branes fits naturally into the mathematical structure of a _",
    "category_. a category is defined as follows ( as copied from @xcite )    a _ category _ @xmath263 consists of the following : a class @xmath264 of _ objects _ , a set @xmath265 of _ morphisms _ for every ordered pair @xmath266 of objects , an _ identity morphism _",

    "@xmath268 for every ordered triple @xmath269 of objects . if @xmath270 and @xmath271 , the composition is denoted @xmath272 .",
    "the above data is subject to two axioms :    1 .",

    "objects are _ rings _ ( or modules , etc . ) , morphisms are _ ring homomorphisms _ ( modules homomorphisms , etc . ) 4 .   objects are _ topological spaces _ , morphisms are _ continuous maps_.    note that in each case above an object is a set , or some glorified notion of a set , and so consists of elements .",
    "one of the key ideas in category theory is to phrase things so that you never make any mention of these elements .",
    "there are also categories whose objects are not composed of elements .",
    "the d - brane categories which will be of particular interest to us are examples of such `` elementless '' categories !    a morphism @xmath276 is often written @xmath277 for obvious reasons . as one might guess , we say that two objects , @xmath147 and @xmath31 , in a category are _ isomorphic _ if there are morphisms @xmath277 and @xmath278 such that @xmath279 and @xmath280",
    ". that is , there exists an invertible morphism between @xmath147 and @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath281    clearly we would like to form a category where the a - branes are the objects and the open strings of the a - model form the morphisms . while one is free to define the set of morphisms of the total hilbert space as in ( [ eq : htot ] )",
    ", we will ultimately see that there is little difference between this and restricting just to the case of @xmath282 .",
    "the composition function corresponds precisely to the notion of two open strings joining together as shown in open string diagram of figure  [ f : comp ] .",
    "the edges of this figure have labels showing to which d - brane the ends of the open string are attached .",
    "this data is encoded in the correlation functions of the topological field theory .",
    "we see from the previous section that the identity operator @xmath283 for a given d - brane @xmath205 is given by the identity operator in @xmath284 .    just as in the case of a single d - brane ,",
    "the correlation functions of the topological a - model coupled to gravity encode a more complicated product rule than the simple composition ( [ eq : comp ] ) .",
    "thus the notion of an @xmath256-algebra is generalized to the notion of an @xmath256-category .",
    "this structure is very interesting and important but we do not really need to concern ourselves with it in these lectures .",

    "the information content of the topological a - model with open strings is precisely the data associated to the category of a - branes .",
    "we already know exactly what the objects are .",
    "we now want to compute the dimensions of the hilbert spaces of open strings and the correlation functions between such states .    to compute the hilbert space of open strings stretched between two different d - branes @xmath285 and @xmath286 , it is easiest to assume that @xmath285 and @xmath286 intersect transversely . as in section [ sss : aopen1 ]",
    ", the @xmath76-invariance of the topological field theory can be used to argue that open strings can only arise from constant maps @xmath100 .",
    "this means that an open string state is associated to a point of intersection @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "the previous section suggests that locally the hilbert space should be given by the de rham cohomology of this intersection , i.e. , the cohomology of a point .",
    "we therefore first guess that there is a one - dimensional hilbert space associated with each point of intersection .",
    "thus the dimension of @xmath287 would be given by the number of points of intersection between @xmath285 and @xmath286 .",
    "this can not be right .",
    "we know the a - model is invariant under hamiltonian deformation of @xmath285 or @xmath286 but the number of points of intersection is not such an invariant . of course ,",
    "the _ oriented _ intersection number @xmath288 is such an invariant as it depends only on homology classes but this turns out to be too crude for our purposes .",
    "let us introduce some notation .",
    "let there be @xmath289 points of intersection between @xmath285 and @xmath286 and let the points be labeled @xmath290 , @xmath291 .",
    "thus we have open string vertex operators @xmath292 that create an open string at the point @xmath290 . our putative hilbert space will be denoted @xmath293 .",
    "each vertex operator @xmath292 has a ghost number that we denote @xmath294 .",
    "this leads to a grading of @xmath88 by ghost number @xmath295    the way to determine the true hilbert space lies in witten s work on morse theory @xcite as generalized in the work of floer @xcite and , in particular , by fukaya @xcite .",
    "we also refer to chapters 10.5 and 40.4 of @xcite for a nice review of this .",
    "because these references are quite thorough , we will only outline the general picture in the following discussion .",
    "the basic idea is that an instanton can `` tunnel '' from an open string state at one point of intersection to an open string at another point of intersection .",
    "the worldsheet of an instanton of such a tunneling process is shown in figure  [ f : tun ] . as we saw earlier , at tree - level",
    "these worldsheet instantons are holomorphic disks in @xmath71 .",
    "these instantons produce a correction to the brst operator resulting in : @xmath296 for some coefficients @xmath297 to be determined .",
    "thus the true hilbert space will be determined as the @xmath76-cohomology of some complex based on the vector space @xmath88 .",
    "since @xmath76 has ghost number one , the complex looks like @xmath298^q&v_{-1}\\ar[r]^q&v_0\\ar[r]^q&v_1\\ar[r]^q&\\ldots }   \\label{eq : flcx}\\ ] ] we define @xmath299 as the cohomology of this complex at position @xmath300 .    to compute @xmath297",
    "we must perform an integral of the moduli space of instantons .",
    "this integral must be performed over the fermionic parameters as well as the obvious bosonic maps @xmath11 . by the usual rules of fermionic integration",
    "such an integral vanishes unless the fermionic parameters cancel in some way , i.e. , we have no net fermionic zero modes . to be more precise , we require that the index of the dirac operator for the instanton is equal to the ghost number of @xmath76 , i.e. , one @xcite .",
    "the index of the dirac operator also measures the generic ( or , to be precise , virtual ) dimension of the moduli space of holomorphic maps .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a nice account of what happens in the non - generic situation . in the generic case ,",
    "we thus compute @xmath297 simply by counting the number of points in the zero - dimensional instanton moduli space .    for an instanton connecting @xmath290 to @xmath301 , the index of the dirac operator",
    "is given by the difference in ghost numbers @xmath302 .",
    "thus we expect that the generic dimension of the moduli space of instantons is given by @xmath303 we refer the reader to @xcite for further information on this point .",
    "the astute reader should have noticed that we have nowhere specified a way that one can actually compute @xmath294 .",
    "given the dimensions of moduli spaces of instantons , the relation ( [ eq : fdm ] ) only gives enough information to compute the _ relative _ ghost number of two points of intersection of @xmath201 and @xmath259 .",
    "indeed , we have the following very important fact :    just how much ambiguity in the ghost number do we actually have ? given a pair of d - branes @xmath285 and @xmath286 we are free to shift the ghost numbers of the open strings from @xmath285 to @xmath286 by some fixed integer .",
    "we also saw in section [ sss : aopen1 ] that if @xmath304 then the ghost number was given by the degree of de rham cohomology which is perfectly well - defined .",
    "furthermore , we would like to preserve ghost number in the operator product @xmath305 the ambiguity in the ghost number can then be accounted for by assigning a ghost number @xmath306 to each d - brane itself .",
    "one then _ defines _ the ghost number of an element of @xmath299 as @xmath307 it is easy to see that this definition has all the properties we desire .",
    "we may restate the above as follows .",
    "the topological a - model has a symmetry which allows us to shift the ghost numbers of the open string states by assigning arbitrary ghost numbers to the a - branes and defining the ghost number as in ( [ eq : gshift ] ) .",
    "note that this idea of assigning integers to lagrangian submanifolds to fix this ambiguity was studied carefully in @xcite .",
    "we will not give details on how to compute the correlation functions .",
    "it should be clear however that there will be instanton corrections involved .",
    "for example , if we compute the three - point function associated to figure [ f : comp ] , at tree - level we will consider holomorphic disks in @xmath71 with boundary conditions shown in figure [ f : din ] .",
    "the cancellation of fermion zero modes will enforce ghost number conservation as usual .    in this section",
    "we have outlined the definition of the category of a - branes in the case that the objects @xmath201 and @xmath259 intersect transversely .",
    "actually one may always use hamiltonian deformations to deform _ any _ pair of lagrangian into this case .",
    "thus we actually have a complete definition of the category of a - branes .",
    "this category is named after fukaya who introduced it .",
    "the reader should note that our discussion of the fukaya category in this section has omitted a vast number of technical details that have made this subject the object of a good deal of attention for the past ten years .",
    "we refer to @xcite , for example , for more of the gory details .",
    "we also refer to @xcite where the fukaya category ( complete with its @xmath256 structure ) is determined explicitly for the 2-torus .",
    "recently , in a remarkable paper @xcite , seidel has described the fukaya category for the quartic k3 surface .",
    "no other examples are known .",
    "the generalization of the fukaya category to the case of higher rank bundles over each a - brane should be fairly obvious . rather than associating @xmath308 with each point of intersection",
    ", we have a matrix representing a linear map from the fibre of one bundle to the fibre of the other over the point of intersection .",
    "we emphasize that nothing in a - model depends on the complex structure of @xmath71 . indeed , the fukaya category is usually defined purely in terms of the symplectic geometry of @xmath71 thus explicitly removing any possible dependence on the complex structure .",
    "the fukaya category depends on @xmath89 for both its objects and its composition of morphisms .",
    "the tadpole condition ( [ eq : tadpole ] ) has a @xmath89 dependence and so certain objects might only exist for particular values of this parameter .",
    "the correlation functions depend on @xmath89 through instanton corrections and so the composition of morphisms are similarly dependent .    finally we should point out that worldsheet instantons are generally expected to adversely affect notions based on the concept of a spacetime metric",
    ". thus it would be reasonable to expect that the concept of a lagrangian submanifold is only really valid at large radius limit .",
    "the composition rules in the fukaya category are based on power series associated to instanton effects . beyond the radius of convergence of these power series it is reasonable to think that the lagrangian submanifold description of a - branes has broken down .",
    "it should be with relief that we turn attention to the b - model on @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately we will see that there is a subtlety concerning the set of all possible b - branes that will occupy us for most of the remaining lectures .",
    "we may repeat the analysis of the beginning of section [ sss : ab ] .",
    "the difference for the case of b - branes is that the b - model twist implies that we should impose @xmath309 for the reflection matrix in ( [ eq : rb ] ) and ( [ eq : rf ] ) .",
    "that is , only the diagonal terms @xmath310 and @xmath311 are nonzero .",
    "this means that the almost complex structure now _ preserves _ the tangent and normal directions to the d - brane , rather than exchanging them .",
    "it follows that the d - brane is a holomorphically embedded submanifold of @xmath2 .",
    "clearly this forces the dimension of the d - brane to be even , i.e. , 0 , 2 , 4 or 6 .",
    "although 0 , 2 and 4-dimensional b - branes exist , we will at first restrict attention only to the 6-dimensional case , where the d - brane fills @xmath2 .",
    "that is we put purely neumann conditions on the open string .",
    "the complexities of b - branes will allow us to deduce the properties of all the b - branes purely from a knowledge of 6-branes .- brane is a brane with @xmath95-dimensions _ in the  directions _ and any number of dimensions in the uncompactified part of spacetime . ]    as in the a - brane , consideration of the @xmath31-field forces us to consider the possibility of a bundle over the b - brane , i.e. , a bundle @xmath312 . setting the @xmath31-field equal to zero we may consider the constraint on this bundle from the requirement that the variation of the action from the boundary term is zero . in this case",
    ", we find that the curvature , @xmath228 , of the bundle is a 2-form purely of type ( 1,1 ) @xcite .",
    "in other words , @xmath312 , is a _",
    "holomorphic bundle_.    we refer again to chapter 15 of @xcite for a very readable account of holomorphic vector bundles .",
    "the basic idea is that the transition functions for the bundle may be written as holomorphic functions of the coordinates of @xmath2 .",
    "thus the bundles may be described very naturally in the language of algebraic geometry . in section [ s : maths",
    "] this will allow us to move from the language of bundles to the language of sheaves which , although alien to most physicists , is definitely the right language for b - branes .",
    "since we have chosen purely neumann boundary conditions on the open string , we have effectively set the matrix @xmath203 equal to the identity in ( [ eq : rf ] ) .",
    "thus , from ( [ eq : btw ] ) we have , on the boundary @xmath313 and so a local operator will depend only on @xmath11 and @xmath314 .",
    "it follows that local operators look like @xmath145-forms .",
    "suppose we have two b - branes in the form of two bundles @xmath315 and @xmath316 .",
    "paton degrees of freedom are associated with maps from @xmath317 to @xmath318 .",
    "we denote the space of such maps as @xmath319 .",
    "we saw in section [ ss : b ] that the brst operator @xmath76 looks like the dolbeault operator in the b - model . adding all these ingredients together",
    ", we see that an open string vertex operator for a string stretching from @xmath317 to @xmath318 is given by the cohomology groups @xmath320    in contrast to the a - brane case , we can choose to declare the ghost number of an operator in ( [ eq : bbh ] ) to be @xmath47 without ambiguity .",
    "as always , the b - model has no instanton corrections .",
    "if @xmath321 then we may compute the 3-point function exactly from @xmath322 and deduce an operator product algebra .",

    "if the b - model is coupled to gravity one may analyze higher @xmath217-point functions . in",

    "this @xmath256 structure was analyzed more abstractly by merkulov @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for more discussion of the @xmath256 structure in topological field theories .      given the dreadful complexities one is forced to endure to define the fukaya category ( most of which we omitted ) the reader is probably shocked at how easy the b - branes were to analyze .",
    "it would be remarkable if one could now invoke mirror symmetry and say that the category of a - branes on @xmath71 is equivalent to the category of b - branes on @xmath2 at this point .",
    "unfortunately this equivalence would be wrong with our current definition of b - branes .",
    "the problem is that we simply do not have enough b - branes .",
    "clearly our assumption that b - branes are 6-branes is too strong .",
    "the lower - dimensional branes certainly exist and one might hope that such branes account for the missing b - branes .",
    "sadly we still fall far short of the number of objects in the fukaya category .",
    "there is a lack of symmetry between the a - branes and b - branes which is key in the failure of mirror symmetry . in section [ sss : aopen2 ]",
    "we had a real problem when we tried to assign an intrinsic ghost number to an open string which we solved by labeling the a - branes with a ghost number .",
    "the b - branes did not have this problem .",
    "we will essentially restore mirror symmetry by inflicting the ghost number ambiguity on the b - branes !",
    "as kontsevich proposed as far back as 1994 @xcite , the answer involves going to the `` derived category '' as we will explain in section [ s : bcat ] .",
    "before continuing with the story of b - branes we need some more mathematical weapons . as these ideas are not familiar to a typical physicist we will try to be fairly thorough . most of the ideas in this section are taken from @xcite .    as defined in section [ ss : bb ] , a b - brane is associated to a vector bundle over @xmath2 . in section [ ss : b ] we noted that the b - model for a closed string can be described in purely algebraic terms . in order to do the same for closed strings we need to replace vector bundles by something purely algebraic , namely sheaves .",
    "this mathematical construction appears to be unavoidable if one wants to fully understand b - branes .",
    "anyone who ignores the language of sheaves would be forced to reinvent it !    in order to discuss sheaves",
    "properly we use quite a bit of categorical language .",

    "note that grothendieck s theorem is not valid for @xmath407 .      given a morphism between two objects in a category we would like to define the notion of kernel and cokernel of this map .",

    "the first thing we need to define is the notion of the identity in some categorical way .",
    "this is done as follows    a _ zero object _ in a category is an object @xmath411 such that for any object @xmath31 there is precisely one morphism in @xmath412 and precisely one morphism in @xmath413 .",
    "if the zero object exists , then for any pair of objects , @xmath31 and @xmath410 , we define the _ zero morphism _ ( also denoted as @xmath411 ) in @xmath414 as the composition @xmath415 .",

    "it represents the absence of a d - brane !    secondly , we are going to restrict attention to _ additive categories_. this is a category with a zero object and an abelian group structure ( written as addition ) on the set of morphisms @xmath414 such that the distributive law @xmath416 and @xmath417 is true for compositions . for every pair @xmath31 and @xmath410 , but this is nt very important in this discussion . ]",
    "it is easy to see that the zero morphism is the identity in the group @xmath414 .",

    ", a monomorphism is the same thing as an injective map .",
    "if the kernel object exists , it is unique up to isomorphism .",
    "while we re at it , we can reverse all the arrows in the above to define the cokernel :    the _ cokernel _ of a morphism @xmath408 is a morphism @xmath426 such that @xmath427 and which satisfies the following `` universal '' property : for any morphism @xmath428 such that @xmath429 , there is a unique morphism @xmath430 such that @xmath431 .",

    "the answer is that the category of sheaves does not quite behave as one might expect when this categorical machinery is applied to it .",
    "one might be forgiven for thinking that given a map between sheaves , @xmath358 , one could apply the old ideas of kernel and cokernel to the group maps @xmath435 to get a definition of kernel and cokernel of @xmath11 .",

    "the cohomology of this complex at position @xmath217 is then defined as the cokernel object of the map @xmath453 .",
    "we generally denote the cohomology @xmath454 in the case that it is an abelian group , or @xmath455 if it is a sheaf .",
    "there is a remarkable theorem due to freyd @xcite that says that , if the objects in an abelian category can be described as a set , the category may be embedded in the category of @xmath203-modules for some ring @xmath203 .",
    "this effectively means that the objects in such a category can be thought of as consisting of elements .",
    "we will see eventually that the categories we build for a - branes and b - branes are not abelian  hence the necessity for the abstractions of category theory .",

    "we begin with an _ abelian _ category @xmath263 .",
    "the derived category of @xmath263 , denoted @xmath678 has objects consisting of _ complexes _ of objects of @xmath263 .",
    "we will denote these chain complexes @xmath649 , etc .",
    ", as in the last section .",
    "if we were being careful , we would distinguish the case where these complexes had finite length and call it the `` bounded derived category ''",
    ". as it is , we will be sloppy and implicitly assume this finiteness condition most of the time .",
    "we will build up the set of morphisms in two stages . as we saw in section [ ss : bop ] , a chain map is defined as a map between complexes such that all squares commute . given two chain maps @xmath679 we define a _ chain homotopy _ from @xmath403 to @xmath329 as a set of maps @xmath680 such that we have a diagram @xmath681^{d^{\\ce}_{n-2 } } &      \\ce^{n-1}\\ar[r]^{d^{\\ce}_{n-1}}\\ar[d]^(0.3){f_{n-1},g_{n-1 } }                 \\ar[dl]^{h_{n-1 } } &      \\ce^{n}\\ar[r]^{d^{\\ce}_{n}}\\ar[d]^(0.3){f_n , g_n}\\ar[dl]^{h_{n } } &      \\ce^{n+1}\\ar[r]^{d^{\\ce}_{n+1}}\\ar[d]^(0.3){f_{n+1},g_{n+1 } }                 \\ar[dl]^{h_{n+1 } }            & \\ldots\\ar[dl]^{h_{n+2}}\\\\    \\ldots\\ar[r]^{d^{\\cf}_{n-2 } } &      \\cf^{n-1}\\ar[r]^{d^{\\cf}_{n-1 } } &      \\cf^{n}\\ar[r]^{d^{\\cf}_{n } } &      \\cf^{n+1}\\ar[r]^{d^{\\cf}_{n+1}}&\\ldots , } \\ ] ] with @xmath682 for all @xmath217 .",
    "the first set of morphisms that we include in the derived category consists of the set of chain maps modulo chain homotopies .    comparing to section [ ss : bop ] ,",
    "the reader might like to check that , given a general map between two chains @xmath649 and @xmath659 , a map that is a chain map will be @xmath76-closed , and that two chain maps differing by a chain homotopy differ by something @xmath76-exact .",
    "thus these morphisms do give _",
    "part _ of the set of morphisms in the category of b - branes .    given a chain map @xmath683",
    ", we induce a map @xmath684 between the _ cohomologies _ of the complexes",
    ". we should emphasize that we do _ not _ mean sheaf cohomology , but rather the cohomology in the sense of abelian categories in section [ sss : abc ] .",
    "thus , for the category of @xmath355-modules , the objects @xmath685 are sheaves  hence the notation .",
    "a chain map is called a _ quasi - isomorphism _ if the induced morphisms @xmath686 are isomorphisms in the category @xmath263 for all @xmath217 .",
    "if the morphism @xmath403 is a quasi - isomorphism , we add another morphism @xmath687 to the derived category which composes with @xmath403 to give the identity .",
    "adding in all these inverse morphisms finally constructs the derived category @xmath678 .",
    "thus the derived category looks somewhat like @xmath688^{f\\approx}&&b\\ar@/^/[ll]^{f^{-1}}\\ar[dr]^g & &         c\\ar@/^/[dl]^{k^{-1}}\\\\ & d\\ar[ur]_h&&e\\ar@/^/[ur]^{k\\approx } } \\ ] ] where @xmath689 are chain complexes ; @xmath690 are equivalence classes of chain maps modulo homotopy ; and @xmath691 denotes a quasi - isomorphism .    adding in these inverses makes a lot of objects in @xmath678 isomorphic . to be precise , any two objects are isomorphic if the complexes are related by a sequence of quasi - isomorphisms @xmath692 , where the arrows may point in either direction .",
    "note that any complex @xmath649 obviously has the same cohomology as the sequence given by the cohomology itself , i.e. , the following complex with zero morphisms : @xmath298 ^ -0&\\ch^0(\\ce^\\bullet)\\ar[r]^0&\\ch^1(\\ce^\\bullet)\\ar[r]^0      & \\ch^2(\\ce^\\bullet)\\ar[r]^-0&\\ldots , }   \\label{eq : ccom}\\ ] ] however , it is not necessarily true that there is a chain map in either direction between @xmath649 and ( [ eq : ccom ] ) .",
    "thus , in general , a complex need not be quasi - isomorphic to its cohomology .",
    "this very important fact leads to the complicated structure of the derived category .",
    "suppose @xmath263 is the abelian category with objects corresponding to complex linear vector spaces and morphisms corresponding to linear maps . in this case , there _ is _ always a quasi - isomorphism between a complex and its cohomology and thus the derived category takes on a simple form .",
    "every isomorphism class of objects is determined by its cohomology .",
    "we emphasize again though that this simplification does not happen in a more general case , such as sheaves .",
    "let s see what these quasi - isomorphisms do in the b - brane category .",
    "the first thing we should note is that the category of locally - free sheaves is not abelian . in order to compute the cohomology of a complex",
    "we need a larger abelian category in which the category of locally - free sheaves is embedded .",
    "we may take this to be @xmath355-modules for example .",
    "consider the double complex @xmath693 that we constructed in ( [ eq : irm ] ) for the complex @xmath659 . applying the spectral sequence construction we obtain @xmath694 and @xmath695 for @xmath61 .",
    "it follows that @xmath696 and thus the total cohomology of this complex is given by @xmath697 . of course",
    ", the total cohomology of this double complex is , by construction , the cohomology of the single combined complex given in ( [ eq : ising ] ) . the means that the injective resolution in ( [ eq : irm ] ) is equivalent to the statement that @xmath698&\\cf^{n}\\ar[r]\\ar[d]&\\cf^{n+1}\\ar[r]\\ar[d ]            & \\cf^{n+2}\\ar[r]\\ar[d]&\\ldots\\\\    \\ldots\\ar[r]&\\ci^{n}\\ar[r]&\\ci^{n+1}\\ar[r]&\\ci^{n+2}\\ar[r]&\\ldots } \\ ] ] is a quasi - isomorphism .",
    "we also say that this quasi - isomorphism represents an injective resolution of the _ complex _ @xmath659 .",
    "now , if we have a quasi - isomorphism @xmath699 , we may compose this chain map with the quasi - isomorphism ( injective resolution ) @xmath700 to obtain another quasi - isomorphism @xmath701  but this is clearly an injective resolution again .",
    "thus @xmath702 represents an injective resolution of both @xmath649 and @xmath659 !    referring back to all the computations in section [ ss : bop ] ,",
    "where we used these injective resolutions , it should now be fairly clear that any two complexes related by a quasi - isomorphism are isomorphic objects in the category of b - branes . if @xmath649 and @xmath659 are quasi - isomorphic , the construction of @xmath677 is identical to the construction of @xmath703 and thus contains a natural `` identity '' element , as does @xmath704 and these elements are naturally inverses to each other .",
    "thus the quasi - isomorphisms are invertible  just like the derived category .",
    "given two objects @xmath649 and @xmath659 in the derived category , how might we go about computing the set of morphisms @xmath705 ?",
    "we can chase the inverted quasi - isomorphisms as follows .",
    "suppose we have a third object @xmath706 with the following chain maps @xmath707^f\\ar[d]^{\\approx}&\\cf^\\bullet\\\\    \\ce^\\bullet } \\ ] ] where @xmath691 denotes a quasi - isomorphism .",
    "these maps do not imply the existence of a chain map @xmath699 , but in the derived category the map @xmath403 _ will _ contribute to @xmath705 since it may be composed with the inverse of the quasi - isomorphism .",
    "thus to compute @xmath705 we need to look at chain maps between all objects quasi - isomorphic to @xmath649 and @xmath659 . to actually carry this process out",
    "is hopelessly impractical .",
    "thankfully there is a often a better way .",
    "suppose the abelian category @xmath263 is such that all objects have an injective resolution .",
    "thus , for any complex @xmath659 , we have a quasi - isomorphism @xmath700 , where @xmath702 is a complex of injective objects . with a bit of effort , one may then show ( see sections 3.10 and 3.11 of @xcite or chapter 10 of @xcite ) that @xmath705 is equal to the set of chain maps from @xmath649 to @xmath702 modulo chain homotopies .    but wait !",
    "this is _ exactly _ how we were computing the hilbert space of open strings @xmath705 in section [ ss : bop ] .",
    "thus , to be almost precise , * the category of b - branes is the derived category of locally - free sheaves .",
    "*      so what s wrong with the last statement in the previous section ?",
    "the objects in the category of b - branes are indeed complexes of locally - free sheaves and the morphisms are computed exactly in the manner of the derived category .",
    "the only problem is that the way we defined the derived category , we had to begin with an _ abelian _ category .",
    "this was necessary so that we could take the cohomology of the complex and thus define the notion of a quasi - isomorphism .",
    "locally - free sheaves do not form an abelian category since they do not contain their own cokernels . the way we defined",
    "quasi - isomorphisms was to embed the category of locally - free sheaves into the category of @xmath355-modules where the cohomology was defined .",
    "this is only really a cosmetic problem . to be pedantic we should replace the category of locally - free sheaves by the minimal abelian full subcategory of @xmath355-modules containing locally - free sheaves . in section [ sss : coh ]",
    "we saw that this is the category of _ coherent sheaves_. we have thus proven that    this was first conjectured by kontsevich @xcite .",
    "this proof is an improved version of an argument in @xcite which , in turn , was based on ideas by douglas @xcite .",
    "we should emphasize that we have added nothing by going from locally - free sheaves to coherent sheaves . on a smooth space ,",
    "any coherent sheaf @xmath708 has a locally - free resolution , i.e. , an exact sequence @xcite , and thus we know we need go no further than @xmath709 . ]",
    "@xmath484&\\cf^{-3}\\ar[r]&\\cf^{-2}\\ar[r]&\\cf^{-1}\\ar[r]&\\cf^0\\ar[r]&\\ca\\ar[r]&0 , } \\ ] ] where each @xmath710 is locally free .",
    "this is nothing but a quasi - isomorphism , @xmath711 , between a complex of locally - free sheaves and a coherent sheaf .",
    "similarly , any complex of coherent sheaves is quasi - isomorphic to a complex of locally - free sheaves .",
    "we saw in section [ sss : coh ] that an example of a coherent sheaf looked a lot like a 0-brane .",
    "since we have now shown that all coherent sheaves are b - branes , we will assert that it really is the 0-brane .",
    "suppose we have an embedding @xmath712 , and we are given a sheaf @xmath372 on @xmath713 . in section [ sss : cech ]",
    "we defined a sheaf @xmath505 on @xmath2 .",
    "this naturally embeds the set of sheaves on @xmath713 into the sheaves on @xmath2 .",
    "one might be forgiven for thinking that , if @xmath372 is a locally - free sheaf associated to a vector bundle @xmath239 , then @xmath505 would represent a b - brane wrapping the cycle @xmath713 with vector bundle @xmath714 .",
    "it turns out that this is not true .",
    "this may be traced to the freed ",
    "witten anomaly @xcite . to get the correct answer requires an explicit analysis of the vertex operators in the topological field theory for the 2-cycles and 4-cycles as was done by katz and sharpe @xcite .",
    "the sheaf @xmath505 corresponds to a `` bundle '' @xmath715 , where @xmath716 is the canonical line bundle of @xmath713 . note that if @xmath713 does not admit a spin structure , then @xmath715 is a `` twisted bundle '' in the sense that its first chern class is not integral",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite .    to recap",
    ", we only needed to consider 6-branes in order to find the correct category for all b - branes .",
    "that said , the precise identification of which sheaves correspond to 2-branes and 4-branes requires the further analysis of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that there are many many more coherent sheaves on @xmath2 than these wrapped branes @xmath505 .",
    "indeed , the derived category @xmath717 itself is a vast thing encompassing a good deal more than one would expect for b - branes .",
    "this is because we have yet to analyze the _ stability _ of the b - branes  something the b - model knows nothing about .",
    "a physical d - brane in the untwisted theory will only correspond to stable objects in some sense and this condition will rule out the vast majority of objects in @xmath717 .    in this proof of b - branes being described by the derived category @xmath717 we should note we assumed that b - branes really are described by a category .",
    "in particular , we assumed that two b - branes which are isomorphic in the category are the `` same '' b - brane .",
    "it is probably a deep philosophical question as to when two abstractly - defined d - branes are the `` same '' in a strict sense .",
    "all we can say is that , within the language of the data of topological field theory , two b - branes which are isomorphic in @xmath717 are indistinguishable .",
    "if someone wishes to add extra data beyond the topological field theory , then it could be that two quasi - isomorphic complexes represent different d - branes .",
    "in section [ ss : bdef ] we only considered deformations arising from @xmath718 .",
    "the obvious question to ask is whether there are any more deformations which can take us outside the derived category .",
    "for example , we could turn on some open strings corresponding to @xmath719 to produce a more complicated `` complex '' : @xmath298^{d_{n-1 } }    & \\ce^n\\ar[r]^{d_n } &    \\ce^{n+1}\\ar[r]^{d_{n+1}}\\ar@/^7mm/[ll]_{g_{n+1 } } &     \\ce^{n+2}\\ar[r]^{d_{n+2}}\\ar@/_7mm/[ll]_{g_{n+2 } } &     \\ldots\\ar@/^7mm/[ll]_{g_{n+3 } } } \\label{eq : ecx2}\\ ] ] this actually produces nothing new . to see this first replace the complex @xmath649 by a quasi - isomorphic complex @xmath702 of injective sheaves . now use the definition of @xmath614 in section [ sss : shco ] and we see that the strings @xmath720 are converted into maps @xmath721 returning us to the case considered in section [ ss : bdef ] .    about the most general deformation we may consider is as follows .",
    "suppose we have two d - branes given by complexes @xmath649 and @xmath659 .",
    "assuming the ghost numbers of the components were not affected by turning on the differentials , an open string corresponding to @xmath722,\\cf^\\bullet)$ ] will have ghost number one .",
    "thus we may consider a deformation given by @xmath403 .",
    "it is easy to see that this produces a new combined complex : @xmath723&{\\begin{matrix}\\ce^{-1}\\\\ \\oplus\\\\\\cf^{-1}\\end{matrix } } \\ar[r]^{\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}d^\\ce&0\\\\f&d^\\cf\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ) } & { \\begin{matrix}\\ce^0\\\\ \\oplus\\\\\\cf^0\\end{matrix } } \\ar[r]^{\\left(\\begin{smallmatrix}d^\\ce&0\\\\f&d^\\cf\\end{smallmatrix}\\right ) } & { \\begin{matrix}\\ce^1\\\\ \\oplus\\\\\\cf^1\\end{matrix}}\\ar[r ] & \\ldots } \\label{eq : cone}\\ ] ] this construction is well - known in the context of the derived category and is known as the _ mapping cone _ of @xmath403 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a nice account of why it has this name .",
    "we denote the new complex in ( [ eq : cone ] ) as @xmath724\\to\\cf^\\bullet)$ ] or just @xmath725 .",
    "the cone construction encompasses almost all the deformations we can consider .",
    "for example , a complex itself can be considered an iterated cone : @xmath726 where we think of a sheaf as a complex with a single entry .    the only exception to",
    "this rule is the case of deformations given by @xmath727 .",
    "adding such a vertex operator to the action simply deforms @xmath631 itself .",
    "this is not quite the same thing as forming @xmath728)$ ] in the derived category although the concepts are very closely related . in the latter case we are turning on a string between @xmath649 and a second copy of this d - brane whereas in the former case",
    "there was an open string beginning and ending on the same d - brane .",
    "what @xmath728)$ ] actually represents is a family of infinitesimal deformations of @xmath649 rather than the deformed @xmath649 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for more details on the theory of deformations .",
    "there is an interesting feature of the deformations we are considering which is worth discussing .",
    "suppose we turn on a nonzero map @xmath729 .",
    "clearly we can rescale this map by a nonzero number @xmath730 .",
    "there is now a quasi - isomorphism @xmath731&0\\ar[r]&\\ce^0\\ar[r]^f\\ar[d]^1 &     \\ce^1\\ar[r]\\ar[d]^c&0\\ar[r]&\\ldots\\\\ \\ldots\\ar[r]&0\\ar[r]&\\ce^0\\ar[r]^{cf}&\\ce^1\\ar[r]&0\\ar[r]&\\ldots , } \\ ] ] and so the deformations @xmath403 and @xmath732 represent the same b - brane .. ] we may use this feature to justify our assumption that the maps @xmath112 in section [ ss : bdef ] were infinitesimal since their scale does nt matter at all !",
    "thus , as the deformation @xmath403 is turned on from zero , we suddenly obtain the new d - brane and any increase in @xmath403 makes no difference .",
    "such discontinuous behaviour is common in algebraic geometry and therefore it should come as no surprise that b - brane exhibit such behaviour . in the untwisted theory one might expect more continuous behaviour and in section [ sss : pi ]",
    "we will see that this is so .",
    "one of the key steps in arriving at the derived category picture was associating a ghost number with each b - brane in section [ ss : bdef ] .",
    "how physical is this ?",
    "that is , is there much of a difference between a b - brane associated to the complex @xmath649 and a b - brane associated to the shifted complex @xmath733 $ ] for some @xmath217 ?",
    "relative shifts certainly matter .",
    "we have @xmath734),\\ ] ] for generic @xmath735 and nonzero @xmath217 .",
    "if we shift all the complexes by the same @xmath217 then there is no change in the physics .",
    "that is , @xmath736,\\cf^\\bullet[n]),\\ ] ] and there is no change in any of the operator products .",
    "thus , it looks like there is a gauge symmetry of the theory associated to a global shift of the complexes by any integer .    while this is essentially correct",
    ", there is a subtlety used in the language of d - branes that makes it preferable to state the gauge symmetry in a different way .",
    "consider a complex as follows : @xmath298&0\\ar[r]&\\ce\\ar[r]^c&\\ce\\ar[r]&0\\ar[r]&\\ldots , } \\label{eq : cancel}\\ ] ] where the nontrivial map is given by multiplication by @xmath730 . if @xmath737 , the complex ( [ eq : cancel ] ) is quasi - isomorphic to zero .",
    "that is , the two @xmath372 s in ( [ eq : cancel ] ) cancel out .",
    "in other words , the @xmath372 on the left is the `` anti - brane '' of the @xmath372 on the right .",
    "turning on @xmath738 must represent a `` tachyon condensate '' in the sense of sen @xcite which performs the cancellation .",
    "we will have much more to say about such tachyons in section [ sss : tachy ] and [ sss : pi ] .",
    "the generalization of this cancellation is that the mapping cone of the identity map @xmath739 is quasi - isomorphic to zero for any complex @xmath649 . from section [ ss : mdefs ]",
    "it follows that @xmath740 $ ] represents the anti - brane to @xmath649 .",
    "the gauge symmetry is therefore stated as follows @xcite    we should warn that this anti - brane language is a little crude and can lead to misleading statements . for example @xmath740",
    "$ ] is the anti - brane to @xmath649 , and @xmath741 $ ] is the anti - brane to @xmath740 $ ] in the above sense .",
    "it does _ not _ follow that @xmath649 and @xmath741 $ ] are the same d - brane , however , since @xmath705 is not generically equal to @xmath742,\\cf^\\bullet)$ ] .",
    "this gauge symmetry means that any intrinsic physical property associated to a d - brane @xmath649 is also given to @xmath733 $ ] for any @xmath217 .",
    "this would include mass , stability ( to be discussed later ) , etc .",
    "thus , if a particular d - brane @xmath649 becomes massless at a given point in moduli space , all the d - branes @xmath733 $ ] become massless .",
    "however , it does not mean that an infinite number of d - branes has become massless in a physically meaningful way , since all these d - branes are gauge equivalent . for counting purposes the collection @xmath743:n\\in\\z\\}$ ]",
    "is one d - brane !",
    "the fact that d - brane / anti - d - brane annihilation is built into the derived category descriptions means that we can map the derived category to witten s k - theory language for d - branes @xcite . to do this",
    "we basically disregard all the information contained in the morphisms .",
    "we saw above that we could deform two d - branes @xmath744 $ ] and @xmath659 into a single d - brane represented by the cone of a morphism @xmath745\\to\\cf^\\bullet$ ] .",
    "thus the b - brane @xmath725 is composed of @xmath744 $ ] and @xmath659 , where @xmath744 $ ] is an anti-@xmath649 .",
    "we may therefore assert that @xmath746 & = [ \\cf^\\bullet ] + [ \\ce^\\bullet[-1 ] ] \\\\       & = [ \\cf^\\bullet ] - [ \\ce^\\bullet ] , \\end{split } \\label{eq : cong}\\ ] ] where @xmath747 $ ] represents some kind of `` class '' of a d - brane .",
    "we may define an abelian group @xmath748 which is generated by all the objects in @xmath717 and we divide out by all relationships of the form ( [ eq : cong ] ) for all possible mapping cones .",
    "this group @xmath748 is called the `` grothendieck group '' of @xmath2 ( see page 77 of @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the grothendieck group was also discussed in @xcite in the context of d - branes .",
    "we may naturally map the derived category to k - theory as follows .",
    "using locally - free resolutions we may replace any complex by a quasi - isomorphic complex @xmath649 of locally - free sheaves .",
    "we may then construct the k - theory object @xmath749 where @xmath750 is the holomorphic vector bundle associated to @xmath751 .",
    "one can show that this leads to a well - defined map @xmath752 .",
    "note that this map need not be surjective .",
    "@xmath753 is generated by all vector bundles whereas we have restricted attention to holomorphic vector bundles .",
    "this is because we have focused only on b - branes , which are essentially bps .",
    "the full k - theory might require some non - bps branes in order to generate all possible classes .",
    "anyway , we should emphasize that k - theory contains much less information than the derived category .",
    "for example , all 0-branes on @xmath2 would be represented by the same k - theory element .",
    "in contrast , two 0-branes corresponding to distinct points in @xmath2 are associated to non - isomorphic objects in @xmath717 .",
    "we like to think of k - theory as a `` poor man s derived category '' that knows only about d - brane charge .    a more precise notion of d - brane charge",
    "may be defined from the world - volume of the d - brane .",
    "this may be computed by anomaly inflow arguments following @xcite .",
    "this subject is covered by harvey s lectures at this tasi meeting and so we may refer to @xcite and be brief here . a d - brane corresponding to a vector bundle @xmath239",
    "is given a charge @xmath754 where @xmath755 is the chern character of @xmath239 and @xmath756 is the todd class of the tangent bundle of @xmath2 .",
    "note that @xmath757 is an element of @xmath758 .",
    "it follows from above that this extends to the derived category by @xmath759 where @xmath760    in section [ ss : cohb ] we argued that a d - brane wrapped on @xmath713 was given by a coherent sheaf @xmath505 .",
    "the charge of such a d - brane can be computed using the _ grothendieck  riemann  roch theorem_. in the special case that we have an embedding @xmath761 , this asserts that @xmath762 where @xmath763 is defined on cohomology as @xmath764 , where @xmath765 is poincar duality and @xmath766 in this latter context is the natural map induced by @xmath300 on homology .",
    "it follows that , for any @xmath767 , we have the following formula @xmath768 where @xmath769 is the normal bundle of @xmath713 in @xmath2 .",
    "that said , in section [ ss : cohb ] we also saw that @xmath505 corresponds to a b - brane given by a ( twisted ) bundle @xmath770 over @xmath713 , where @xmath239 is the bundle associated to @xmath372 . using the relation @xmath771 and the fact that @xmath772 , we may therefore rewrite ( [ eq : sub0 ] ) as @xmath773 which is the formula one would arrive at via anomaly consideration @xcite .",
    "if the a - model on @xmath71 is `` the same '' as the b - model on @xmath2 , then it would appear that we have motivated the proposal that the fukaya category on @xmath71 is equivalent to @xmath717 , the derived category on @xmath2 .",
    "that was kontsevich s original proposal .",
    "it turns out that there is still a small fly in the ointment , as we discuss in section [ sss : mirn ] , but this proposal seems to be very close to the truth . in this section",
    "we note a few miscellaneous features of how well this mirror symmetry works .",
    "the d - brane charge of an a - brane is simply given by its homology class in @xmath774\\in h_3 $ ] multiplied by the rank of the bundle over the lagrangian .",

    "this author is not aware of a complete argument in the literature for how to compute this , but we may proceed a little less than rigorously as follows .",
    "the first step is to note that @xmath813 is given in the mirror by a period @xmath814 for some 3-cycle @xmath205 .",

    "since @xmath824 , the chern character by itself it not gauge invariant and must always appear in the combination @xmath825 in any physical quantity .",

    "if we know exactly just how asymptotic this formula is , we have enough information to determine exactly which combination of periods give @xmath813 exactly .",
    "the periods are associated to the prepotential in special geometry and so one expects them to receive corrections in the same way .",
    "such corrections were discussed in @xcite and appear in two ways :    1 .",
    "the perturbative corrections will be due to the 4-loop correction in the  as analyzed in @xcite .",

    "we will see in section [ sss : qmon ] very explicitly that there is nontrivial monodromy in @xmath717 which changes the set of stable objects as we go around loops in the moduli space .",

    "this separated terms in the complexes far enough to avoid everything collapsing back to a single term complex .",
    "that such @xmath614 s can ever be physically relevant is traced back to fact that the grading @xmath232 was defined to live in @xmath977 rather than on a circle .",

    "we should add that there has also been recent progress in more advanced methods of analyzing the gepner model @xcite which appear to fill in the missing states of the boundary conformal field theory method .",
    "one of the easiest ways of seeing that b - branes as subspaces is an inadequate picture is to think about monodromy in d - branes as we move around loops in the moduli space .    in the case of a - branes , such monodromy is purely classical .",
    "the periods of the holomorphic 3-form over integral 3-cycles undergo non - trivial monodromy as we go around non - contractible loops in the moduli space of complex structure .",
    "such monodromy may be interpreted as an automorphism of @xmath978 which preserves the intersection form between 3-cycles .",
    "thus the homology classes of a - branes undergo monodromy and thus the a - branes themselves undergo monodromy .",
    "how is monodromy seen in the b - branes ? in this case , the d - brane charge is an element of @xmath979 . in the case of the quintic we know exactly how to map between @xmath978 and @xmath979 thanks to the analysis of section [ sss : qper ] .",
    "thus we can copy the monodromy action from the a - model into the b - model . if one begins with a particular sheaf @xmath331 , one",
    "can then compute the monodromy action on @xmath980 to get some idea of what this b - brane becomes under monodromy . in this way",
    ", it looks as if 2-cycles may becomes mixtures of 2-cycles and 0-cycles etc .",
    ", which is certainly not classical !",
    "furthermore , it is not hard to find examples where the resulting element of @xmath979 can not correspond to the chern character of any sheaf ( for example , the rank of the bundle might be negative ) . fortunately going to the derived category solves these problems .    upon going around a loop in the moduli space",
    "the physics must be unchanged of course .",
