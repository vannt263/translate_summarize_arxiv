    "<S> because of its underlying nature and possible applications in the field of all - optical processing , the optical bistability ( ob ) was a subject of an intense experimental and theoretical research.@xcite in the early studies the use of a saturable absorber to induce ob was suggested.@xcite the phenomenon was demonstrated experimentally for a cell of sodium vapor enclosed in a fabry perot interferometer and excited by a cw dyelaser.@xcite later it was conjectured that the local - field corrections alone could give rise to the mirrorless ob .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this type of bistability was extensively studied@xcite and observed experimentally.@xcite    the practical interest in all - optical devices faded to some extent as their solid state counterparts proved to perform better in terms of the switching speed and device density . </S>",
    "<S> however , the ob and optical hysteresis remain of considerable interest from the fundamental standpoint as a clear manifestation of a nonlinear light - matter interaction </S>",
    "<S> . some new types of bistability mechanisms were discussed recently.@xcite besides , the question of the ob and hysteresis has received a renewed attention in connection with novel hybrid 0d nanoscopic systems , _ </S>",
    "<S> e. g. _ , an artificial molecules comprising a semiconductor quantum dot ( sqd ) and metal nanoparticles ( see refs .   and references therein ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we address only the mirrorless ob induced by the local - field effects on a two - level system ( tls ) interacting with the electromagnetic field in the dipole approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the local - filed correction leads to a self - action of the system , which results in a nonlinear relation between the applied field and the one acting upon the system .  </S>",
    "<S> this type of the ob mechanism can be relevant for a large variety of systems : dense 3d assemblies of two - level atoms  @xcite , optically dense thin films of tls  @xcite or films of linear molecular aggregates ,  @xcite hybrid metal - semiconductor systems ,  @xcite or a more general case of a tls in an environment involving dielectric and conducting surfaces , such as , a stratified media , a microcavity or a nanostructure .    </S>",
    "<S> ob can occur within a range of internal system parameters and external field intensities ; identifying these ranges is therefore an important problems and its analytical solution is desirable . to the best of the author s knowledge , so far , it has been solved exactly only for two particular cases . </S>",
    "<S> thus , friedberg _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ obtained analytically the bistability condition for the limiting case in which the active mechanism of the feedback is the nonlinear lorentz shift of the resonance in a 3d gas of two - level atoms , which resulted from the near - field corrections .  @xcite ignoring these corrections , zakharov and manykin derived the exact bistability criterion in the other limit in which the self - action is due to the radiated secondary field in a thin 2d film of tls .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the case when both these fields contribute into the self - action has been studied only numerically so far .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    we consider the simplest optical tls coupled to an environment . </S>",
    "<S> the self - action of the tls due to the environment can be described by the surface part of the green s dyadic evaluated at the position of the tls . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in this case the nonlinearity is characterized by a complex number which should satisfy some condition for the ob to occur . </S>",
    "<S> below , we derive such condition analytically .    </S>",
    "<S> following refs .   </S>",
    "<S> we address the ob condition by considering the relationship between the population difference and the excitation field within the framework of the bloch equations for the @xmath0 density matrix @xmath1 of a tls . in the rotating wave approximation </S>",
    "<S> these equations read :    @xmath2\\ , \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> the dipole moment of the system is @xmath14 , where @xmath4 is its complex amplitude .    to calculate the total field @xmath15 the maxwell s equations are to be solved for a particular geometry </S>",
    "<S> however , for a single dipole in an environment the total field @xmath15 can be represented in the following general form : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the renormalized incident field and @xmath18 is the secondary dipole field . </S>",
    "<S> the latter field is due to the feedback of the environment and is related to the corresponding response function@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is determined by the surface part of the green s dyadic evaluated at the position of the dipole . </S>",
    "<S> the near - zone component of the secondary dipole field , governed by @xmath19 , can originate from the near - field corrections ,  @xcite while the far - zone contribution , governed by @xmath20 , can be due to the radiation .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in hybrid nano - systems comprising a sqd , the feedback is provided by the secondary reflected field of the optical transition dipole moment . </S>",
    "<S> thus , independently of its physical mechanism , the self - action is determined by the single complex valued parameter @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the total field @xmath15 acting upon the tls depends therefore on its state . together with the nonlinearity of the tls that can give rise to a variety of effects , such as the ob .    ) for @xmath22 , @xmath23 ( solid line ) , @xmath24 , @xmath23 ( dashed line ) and @xmath25 , @xmath26 ( dotted line ) ]    under the steady - state conditions eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> the above equation highlights a known result of cavity quantum electrodynamics : the real part of the green s dyadic shift the frequency while the imaginary part renormalizes the decay rate.@xcite both effects can be active mechanisms of the ob .    </S>",
    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z ] ) is of the third order in @xmath30 and can therefore have three real roots for some values of @xmath31 , @xmath7 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ( @xmath7 is used as a unit rate from now on ) . </S>",
    "<S> these three solutions are different when the right hand side ( rhs ) of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> the solutions of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ z ] ) are : @xmath35 using the above root @xmath36 and the condition @xmath37 one obtains an important constraint for the detuning @xmath31 : @xmath38 the formal condition of the existence of the double root ( [ roots ] ) is determined by the following equation on @xmath31 : @xmath39 which is cubic in @xmath31 and can also have three real solutions . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that only two of them , say @xmath40 , satisfy the constraint ( [ constr ] ) and yield the upper and lower threshold values of the population difference @xmath30 and the external field @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , eq .  ( [ rhs ] ) has three different real roots within a window of detunings @xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> only two of the solutions of the biquadratic equation  ( [ gr ] ) satisfy the constraint ( [ constr ] ) . analyzing the roots of eq .  </S>",

    "<S> ( [ z ] ) exist within the white area , two of them being stable . </S>",
    "<S> the line dividing the two phases represents the analytical condition eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ crit ] ) which gives also the bistability threshold . </S>",
    "<S> the general criterion eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ crit ] ) recovers both reported exact results : @xmath49 for @xmath50  @xcite and @xmath51 for @xmath52  @xcite ( the corresponding threshold values of @xmath21 are marked by full circles in fig </S>",

    "<S> ( [ crit ] ) is the bistability condition , which constitute the main result of the paper .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we note that novel hybrid plasmonic nano systems , such as a sqd and a metal nanoparticle complex ( see ref .   and references therein ) or a sqd embedded in a stratified medium are excellent model systems with adjustable nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> the self - action field in these complexes is the secondary reflected field of the sqd optical transition dipole moment acting back upon the sqd . in the most general case such environment feedback results in a complex self - action parameter @xmath21 which can be engineered by an appropriate choice of materials , geometry and/or external control parameters . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if the sqd transition frequency is far from the plasmon resonance of the system then , typically , @xmath53 and the dominant mechanism of the bistability is the nonlinear lorentz shift  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the excitation frequency is near the surface plasmon resonance then the feedback can be almost purely imaginary : @xmath54 with @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> algebraically , this case is equivalent to the one of the radiation induced self - action  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a very interesting case is @xmath56 which can hardly be realized in the traditional extended 3d or 2d systems of two - level atoms . </S>",
    "<S> nanoscopic hybrids are much more promising from this point of view due to their greater diversity . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> various instabilities such as auto - oscillations can be expected under steady - state excitation . </S>",
    "<S> however , the detailed study of these instabilities goes beyond the scope of the present contribution and will be analyzed elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> summarizing , we addressed the mirrorless resonant optical bistability of a two - level system in an environment by considering the relationship between the population difference and the intensity of the excitation field . </S>",
    "<S> the feedback of the environment was introduced in a general from via the surface part of the green s dyadic . </S>",
    "<S> we derived the analytical bistability condition and obtained the exact steady state solution of the maxwell - bloch equations at the absolute bistability threshold . </S>",
    "<S> our findings open the possibility to easily analyze diverse physical systems , determine experimental conditions ( such as , the appropriate detuning from the bare resonance and the intensity of the external field ) necessary to observe the bistability and other nonlinear optical effects , as well as design and engineer new systems with desirable nonlinear optical properties . </S>"
