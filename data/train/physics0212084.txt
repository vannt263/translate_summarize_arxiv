    "this paper deals with orbital magnetism in metal clusters . because of a possibly large number of atoms",
    ", the valence electrons may accede single - particle orbitals with very high angular momenta .",
    "the occupation of these orbitals has a large impact in cluster static magnetism @xcite or in collective magnetic modes of orbital nature @xcite .",
    "two remarkable examples are the scissors @xcite and twist @xcite modes .",
    "the scissors mode is strictly correlated with cluster deformation .",
    "it can be viewed as a small - amplitude rotational oscillation of a spheroid of valence electrons against a spheroid of the ionic background ( hence the name sm ) .",
    "the sm is a general dynamical phenomenon already found or predicted in different quantum finite systems .",
    "it was first proposed @xcite and observed @xcite in atomic nuclei where it still remains a hot topic for both experimental and theoretical studies ( for a review see @xcite ) .",
    "it was later predicted in a variety of different systems , like metal clusters @xcite , quantum dots @xcite and ultra - cold superfluid gas of fermionic atoms @xcite .",
    "more remarkably , it was predicted @xcite and observed @xcite in a bose - einstein condensate .",
    "all these different systems have two features in common : the broken spherical symmetry and the two - component nature ( neutrons and protons in nuclei , valence electrons and ions in atomic clusters , electrons and surrounding media in quantum dots , atoms and the trap in dilute fermi gas and bose condensate ) .",
    "the sm strongly affects orbital magnetism in alkali metal clusters .",
    "it can be described in terms of larmor diamagnetism and temperature - independent van vleck paramagnetism @xcite .",
    "they are both weak and , therefore , need to be studied in systems , like alkali metal clusters , where strong forms of magnetism , like ferromagnetism , are absent .",
    "being a low - energy mode , the sm determines the van vleck paramagnetism and causes a strong anisotropy in the magnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "moreover , some particular light clusters can exhibit dia - para anisotropy , being diamagnetic along the z symmetry axis and paramagnetic in x- , y - directions @xcite .",
    "the sm has already been studied in schematic @xcite and microscopic @xcite approaches .",
    "the microscopic calculations , though accounting for quantum shells effects , were not fully self - consistent . a deformed woods - saxon @xcite , rather than a self - consistent kohn - sham , one - body potential was adopted .",
    "the quadrupole deformation was deduced from other models or experimental estimates .",
    "certainly , we need to perform fully self - consistent calculations based on density - functional theory in order to settle the subtle issues , like the fragile dia - para anisotropy , the role of the ionic structure , triaxiality , shape isomers , etc ..    self - consistent calculations , accounting for the ionic structure , were performed for spin - saturated ground and spin - polarized isomeric states of light sodium clusters @xmath0 and @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it was found that the scissors response remains determined basically by the global deformation , in spite of the fact that triaxiality and ionic structure induce a strong fragmentation in the strength .",
    "it was also shown that the detailed ionic structure destroys locally spherical symmetry thereby causing a finite , though very weak , m1 response ( transverse optical mode ) even in clusters with zero global deformation .",
    "calculations of the same level of completeness become prohibitive as one moves to heavier clusters .",
    "for this reason , we are forced to use in the present paper the kohn - sham approach with a soft jellium model for the ionic background @xcite .",
    "this simplifies greatly the calculations and allows to proceed to heavier clusters .",
    "at the same time , the jellium approach is accurate enough for the principle problems considered here .",
    "the treatment of the electrons is fully self - consistent .",
    "we adopt a deformed kohn - sham mean field using the energy functional of @xcite . the cluster shape ( in terms of axial quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations )",
    "is determined by varying the jellium deformation and minimizing the total energy of the system .",
    "the optical response in the linear regime is calculated within the separable random - phase - approximation ( srpa ) method @xcite self - consistently derived from the kohn - sham functional .",
    "the srpa has been already successfully employed for the description of the dipole plasmon in spherical @xcite and deformed @xcite alkali metal clusters .    in the present paper",
    ", we will consider both the optical m1 response and static magnetic orbital effects . in section 2 ,",
    "macroscopic and microscopic treatments of the sm are briefly outlined . in section 3",
    "the calculation scheme is presented .",
    "the optical response is discussed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "it will be shown that , in analogy with the electric dipole plasmon in deformed clusters @xcite , the m1 response in light clusters has a distinctive profile determined by the deformation .",
    "instead , due to a strong landau damping and contributions of shape isomers , the response in medium clusters becomes vague and the sm can be viewed as a statistical mix of contributions from different cluster shapes . besides , we discuss structure of the residual interaction and explain a small collective shift in sm excitations .",
    "the coupling between the high - energy sm branch and the electric quadrupole plasmon is demonstrated . in section 6 ,",
    "the dia - para anisotropy is discussed . in section 7",
    ", we estimate perspectives to observe the sm in photo - absorption , raman scattering and inelastic electron scattering .",
    "the conclusions are given in section 8 .",
    "the macroscopic and microscopic treatment of the sm in clusters is discussed in detail in refs .",
    "thus , we give here only a brief outline for a better understanding of the results presented in the next sections .    in the geometrical model of @xcite ,",
    "the sm arises from a rotational oscillations of valence electrons versus the ions , both assumed to form distinct spheroids ( see left part of fig .",
    "1 ) . following the alternative view of @xcite ( right part of fig .",
    "1 , the displacement field of the mode is a sum of the rigid rotation and a quadrupole term ( the latter provides vanishing velocity of electrons at the surface ) : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the quadrupole deformation parameter ( to be defined in the next section ) . in",
    "axially symmetric systems , the sm is generated by the orbital momentum fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 perpendicular to the symmetry axis @xmath6 , and it is characterized by the quantum numbers @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the eigenvalue of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is the space parity .",
    "energy and magnetic strength of the mode can be estimated macroscopically @xcite : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the number of valence electrons and @xmath14 the wigner - seitz radius .",
    "we use here natural units @xmath15 . the value @xmath16 stands for summed strength of the degenerated x- and y - branches .",
    "the z - branch vanishes for symmetry reasons .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath16 does not depend on @xmath14 and so is the same for different metals .",
    "the microscopic treatment of the sm yields the shell structure of an axially deformed mean field .",
    "one can characterize the emerging single - electron states in terms of the quantum numbers of the axially deformed harmonic oscillator ( clemenger - nilsson basis ) .",
    "these are the triplets @xmath17 $ ] where @xmath18 labels the number of nodes in @xmath6-direction ( = symmetry axis ) and @xmath19 is the principle shell number @xmath20 ( from which one can derive the number @xmath21 of radial nodes ) .",
    "the angular momenta orthogonal to the symmetry axis , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , promote low - energy @xmath24 transitions inside the valence shell and high - energy @xmath25 transitions across two shells .",

    "( [ eq : me ] ) shows that the scissors mode is generated by @xmath31 transitions between the components of one and the same spherical @xmath32-level . in spherical systems , @xmath33-states belonging to the level @xmath32",
    "are degenerate while in deformed systems they exhibit the deformation splitting and so may be connected by m1 transitions with non - zero excitation energies .",
    "this is the origin of the scissors mode .",
    "the energy scale of the scissors mode is determined by the deformation energy splitting and so is rather small .",
    "this explains the predominantly low - energy ( @xmath34=0 ) character of the scissors mode .",
    "just the low - energy branch carries most of the scissors @xmath16 strength ( see also discussion in section [ sec : scissresp ] ) .",
    "the high - energy ( @xmath34=2 ) branch of the mode is much weaker since the particle states involved into ( @xmath34=2 ) transitions include only small @xmath32-components from the valence shell .",
    "our approach @xcite employs the kohn - sham equations for the electronic mean field using actually the energy - density functional of @xcite .",

[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table ii collects summed scissors strengths in wide- ( 0 - 6 ev ) and low - energy ( 0 - 1 ev ) regions , calculated within the srpa .",
    "it is seen that the @xmath24 low - energy scissors mode , being mainly concentrated below 1 ev , contributes strongly to @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this justifies using @xmath45 and @xmath46 for a rough estimation of the energy of the mode as @xmath47 ( or @xmath48 ) .",
    "besides , since @xmath45 is proportional to the paramagnetic susceptibility , this means that just the low - energy sm determines the van vleck paramagnetism ( see discussion in section [ sec : mag_an ] ) .",
    "the high - energy part of the scissors strength ( associated with @xmath25 transitions ) contributes appreciably to the @xmath49 sum rule , i.e. to the total photo - absorption cross section .",
    "table ii also shows that the increase of the @xmath50 with cluster size is not monotonous .",
    "the fluctuations are caused by the predominantly 1ph character of the low - energy sm and by the difference in cluster deformations .",
    "@xmath51 demonstrates especially strong m1 strength , while in oblate clusters @xmath52 and @xmath53 the strength is relatively weak .",
    "4 illustrates the coupling of the high - energy scissors branch to the quadrupole plasmon in @xmath42 . the correlation between m1 and e2 peaks at @xmath54 ev",
    "is clearly seen .",
    "the coupling of electric and magnetic modes with the same quantum numbers @xmath55 is a general feature of deformed finite quantum systems .",
    "it is well known , for example , in atomic nuclei ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the coupling of the sm with dipole and spin - dipole oscillations in clusters was discussed in detail in ref .",
    "in particular , it was shown that breaking the symmetry by the ionic lattice results in a weak coupling between these oscillations of opposite space parity .",
    "this feature may change for clusters deposited on a surface since symmetry breaking is much stronger there .",
    "the calculations @xcite show that light axially deformed clusters ( @xmath56 ) have at the deformation - energy surface one distinct minimum corresponding to the ground - state deformation .",
    "the heavier clusters ( @xmath57 ) have usually two minima with opposite quadrupole deformations ( prolate and oblate ) and very close energies .",
    "the energy difference between the ground and the shape isomeric states is often less than 0.02 ev = 200 k. the number of shape isomers with a tiny energy deficit increases with cluster size .",
    "these isomers may have a variety of very different shapes . and",
    "significant amounts of isomers can be found in a thermal ensemblse and thus contribute to the sm , e.g. , at room temperature .",
    "5 compares the scissors modes built on the ground and isomeric states in @xmath58 .",
    "both of them show a rich spectrum of low lying m1 states .",
    "but the spectra and typical strengths of the two states differ substantially .",
    "indeed , the m1 spectra are generated by several @xmath59 m1 transitions between the levels lying in the vicinity of the fermi surface .",
    "prolate and oblate shapes yield different sequences of the single - particle levels just at the fermi surface . as a result ,",
    "some of the @xmath59 m1 transitions which are significant in the prolate case are transformed to @xmath60 or @xmath61 transitions in the oblate case , thus strongly decreasing the strength .",
    "5 compares also the srpa results obtained with soft jellium model ( [ eq : densi ] ) and detailed ionic structure @xcite . in the case of the ionic structure ,",
    "the global cluster deformations slightly deviate from those in the jellium case .",
    "it is seen that calculations with the ionic structure give somewhat different positions of the sm peaks with respect to the jellium case .",
    "such a redistribution of the peaks is due to different energies of the single - particle levels in the ionic calculations .",
    "the photo - absorption response in the ionic case is stronger , which is also explained by the redistribution of the levels in the mean field .",
    "the level sequence in this case favors a few more @xmath59 transitions of m1 type .    altogether ,",
    "the calculations demonstrate some important points concerning the sm in medium clusters : + i ) the mode is distributed over several @xmath59 transitions .",
    "+ ii ) the single particle spectrum near the fermi level is rather dense and so even small changes in the calculation scheme can redistribute visibly the spectrum and open ( or close ) some relevant @xmath59 transitions .",
    "+ iii ) as was mentioned above , the ground and first isomeric states in medium clusters can be very close in energy .",
    "so , the scissors mode in free medium clusters should be considered as a statistical mixture of contributions from different shapes ( predominantly of the ground state and first isomer ) .",
    "such kind of the analysis ( involving the deformation splitting , landau fragmentation and contributions of shape isomers ) was recently applied to explain experimental e1 optical response in deformed sodium clusters with @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "+ less ambiguous deformations will be provided by the sm in metal clusters deposited on insulating substrates @xcite .",
    "these clusters are oblate and their mean size and magnitude of the deformation can be well controlled .",
    "such clusters seem to be the most promising systems for experimental search of the sm .",
    "rpa calculations show that the sm energies and b(m1 ) strengths scale with the deformation @xmath38 and the electron number @xmath63 basically according to the trends ( [ eq : om ] ) and ( [ eq : b(m1 ) ] ) . strong fluctuations , however , take place in small clusters @xcite .",
    "they reflect the @xmath59 nature of the transitions and may affect the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "the total orbital magnetic susceptibility in clusters is the sum of langevin diamagnetic and van vleck paramagnetic terms @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66 having denoted by @xmath67 the moment of inertia and by @xmath68 its rigid - body value .",
    "the sum in ( [ eq : chi_para ] ) and ( [ eq : mom_in ] ) runs over excited states .",
    "further , @xmath69 is the coordinate index . in axial systems , one has @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "note that for @xmath72 the operator entering in the matrix element in ( [ eq : chi_para ] ) is exactly the scissors generator .",
    "this makes evident that just the low - energy sm mainly contributes to @xmath73 .",
    "indeed table ii shows that contribution of the low - energy scissors mode to the value @xmath74 achieves @xmath75 .",
    "so , just the sm determines the van vleck paramagnetism .    in the schematic model @xcite ,",
    "the moment of inertia comes out as the rigid - body value , so that @xmath76 and , therefore , @xmath77 , i.e. a complete compensation of dia- and para - magnetic terms in @xmath78 takes place . due to axial symmetry",
    ", one also has @xmath79 .",
    "the total susceptibility becomes , therefore , strictly anisotropic @xcite @xmath80 going from zero to diamagnetic values .",
    "on the other hand , strong shell effects in some peculiar light clusters may alter appreciably the above result .",
    "this is illustrated for @xmath81 in fig .",
    "6 . because of very low excitation energy of the sm in this cluster ( see an exceptionally large value of @xmath45 for @xmath81 in fig . 2 and , also , in table ii ,",
    "the paramagnetic susceptibility is enhanced considerably and is no longer balanced by the diamagnetic term .",
    "so , @xmath81 should be paramagnetic in x , y - directions and diamagnetic in z - direction .",
    "the cluster @xmath82 also hints this property .",
    "the magnetic moments in @xmath81 are sufficiently large to allow for a measurement of the dia - para anisotropy .",
    "the observation of this effect would provide a strong ( though indirect ) evidence of the sm in clusters .",
    "as was mentioned in the introduction , the sm is not yet observed experimentally in metal clusters .",
    "the search of the sm is hindered by several factors :    \\1 ) the mode has very low photo - absorption cross section .",
    "following our results , in sodium clusters with @xmath83 , @xmath84 as compared to @xmath85 for the dipole plasmon .",
    "such a weak m1 signal is at the edge of the sensitivity of modern detectors .",
    "( [ eq : m1_cs])-([eq : esr ] ) allow to estimate the ratios for maximal optical responses as @xmath86 and ( for @xmath87 ev @xcite ) @xmath88 this gives for deformed ( @xmath89 ) sodium ( @xmath90 ) clusters @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( the latter for @xmath93 ) .",
    "so , the sm suffers from the competition with e1 and e2 strengths . besides , the competition with e2 increases with cluster size .",
    "the above estimates compare the sm optical response with the maximal responses of e1 and e2 plasmons .",
    "as is shown in the next subsection , the competition is much weaker in the low - energy region where the sm has its stronghold , but one has still to be aware of large amounts of e1 strength .",
    "\\3 ) the low - energy scissors mode lies in the infrared region where commonly used detectors for a visible light are not efficient enough .",
    "\\4 ) the sm energy decreases with cluster size and reaches the region of phonon excitations , @xmath94 , in very big clusters .    in spite of these hindrances , clusters offer enough opportunities to look for the optimal conditions for observing the sm : one may change cluster size and ( or ) deformation , use different metals , choose between free and supported clusters , etc .. the macroscopic estimates ( [ eq : om])-([eq : b(m1 ) ] ) and the present jellium rpa calculations may serve as a guide .",
    "such analysis is briefly given below .",
    "to this purpose , we consider , as a typical case , sodium clusters with a moderate deformation @xmath89 .",
    "larger clusters help because the m1 photo - absorption cross section grows linearly with the size . already in deformed clusters with @xmath95",
    "the scissors signal should be detectable .",
    "unfortunately , the corresponding energy @xmath96 ev approaches or even covers the region of phonon excitations . thus the best compromise for free sodium clusters is achieved at @xmath97 . besides that , these clusters are large enough to ensure the dominance of the orbital scissors mode over spin m1 excitations",
    ".    we may also look for clusters of larger density and deformation to increase the energy and the strength of the mode .",
    "for example , li clusters ( @xmath98  ) allow to increase both the energy and optical response by a factor of @xmath99 with respect to na ( @xmath100  ) .",
    "further improvement may be achieved with ag ( @xmath101  ) , mg ( @xmath102  ) , or al ( @xmath103  ) . in any case",
    ", highly deformed clusters are welcome because @xmath104 and @xmath105 .    in general ,",
    "free clusters seem not suitable for observing the sm .",
    "they are well mass - separated only up to sizes of hundred atoms . however , these systems have a weak m1 signal . as for heavier clusters ,",
    "they suffer from a poor mass separation and are expected to be weakly deformed @xcite .",
    "moreover , as was discussed in section [ sec : isomers ] , their m1 signal is a statistical mix of contributions of different shapes given by the ground state and isomers .",
    "deposited clusters look more promising .",
    "one can adopt techniques that allow to get oblate clusters ( na and ag ) on dielectric surfaces @xcite and , more remarkably , to monitor their size and deformation .",
    "clusters with @xmath106 atoms can be used for this aim . in this way , one can obtain supported clusters of a desired size and shape .",
    "high density of clusters on the surface gives good statistics in the measurements .",
    "last but not least , monitoring the shape of clusters gives the chance to use the trends @xmath107 and @xmath108 to distinguish the sm from the e1 and e2 signals . to this end , one has to irradiate clusters of the same size but of different deformations .",
    "then the low - energy e1 and e2 cross sections are also affected but , hopefully , in an irregular fashion ( thus averaging out ) or , at least , in a way different from the trends mentioned above .",
    "the cross sections measured at different deformations can be mutually subtracted to extract a small useful signal . for the analysis of such experiments ,",
    "we need accurate theoretical estimates accounting for all the main factors and , in particular , the influence of the surface on the electric and scissors plasmons . such work is in progress .",
    "the competition with e1 and e2 modes may be bypassed partly by resorting to specific reactions and techniques capable of hindering if not suppressing the e1 and e2 channels .",
    "we will discuss this issue for three relevant reactions : photo - absorption , resonance raman scattering , and inelastic electron scattering .",
    "the sm lies much lower than the dipole and quadrupole plasmon modes ( 0.2 - 1.0 ev against 2.5 - 3.0 ev for the dipole and 2 - 4 ev for the quadrupole @xcite ) . in principle",
    ", one could exploit this energy separation to focus on the sm . however , its m1 photo - absorption cross section is still very small as compared to the e1 strength and can be masked by the tail of close e1 modes .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 7 which compares e1 , e2 and m1 photo - absorption strengths calculated within srpa approach@xcite in axially deformed @xmath43 ( ground state ) .",
    "the e1 strength , though extremely small compared to the dipole plasmon peak , is still strong enough to mask the sm .",
    "the competition with the quadrupole e2 strength in @xmath43 is negligible ( though it can be stronger in heavier clusters ) .",
    "the competition with the e1 channel can be decreased by using deformed ( oblate ) clusters with @xmath109 atoms , supported on dielectric surfaces , and adopting infrared techniques with polarized light .",
    "for the sm , the magnetic field of the incoming light should be parallel to the surface .",
    "this can be done with both s- and p - polarizations ( with the electrical field to be perpendicular and parallel to the incident plane , respectively ) .",
    "the s - polarized light under an angle @xmath110 with the surface normal suppresses the @xmath111 e1 branch without weakening the sm .",
    "the p - polarized light at angle @xmath112 suppresses the @xmath113 e1 branch , again without weakening the sm .",
    "the second variant seems to be preferable since the @xmath113 branch is generally stronger ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "7 .      in resonance raman scattering ( inelastic scattering of polarized photons )",
    ", the sm may be populated through the de - excitation of the dipole plasmon excited by the incoming photon .",
    "the difference between energies of incoming and outgoing photons gives the energy of the mode .",
    "one must look at e1 decays , which represent the leading channel and may populate in deformed systems m1 as well as e2 states .",
    "with respect to photo - absorption , resonance raman scattering has the advantage of excluding the competition with the strong e1 mode and to work in the visible light region .",
    "an experiment of this kind was carried out in supported ag clusters @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the data suggested , however , that the e2 rather than the sm was populated through the e1 decay . on the other hand , it is not simple to separate clearly the e2 from the m1 modes which are mixed in deformed systems .",
    "inelastic electron scattering is also a promising technique . at backward scattering angles",
    ", the m1 signal should prevail over the electric ones .",
    "this property enabled the discovery of the scissors mode in deformed atomic nuclei @xcite .",
    "polarization of the electrons provides additional possibilities to extract the magnetic response . in nuclear physics , electrons with very high energies ( tens and hundreds mev )",
    "are used , which favors creation of well collimated , intense and monochromatic electron beams .",
    "moreover , at so high energies , it is easier to enhance the relative contribution of the transverse form factor .    the low - energy , intense and monochromatic electron beams , suitable for our purpose , as well as the angular resolved techniques are now available @xcite . to our knowledge , however , inelastic electron scattering was used so far only to observe the dipole plasmon .",
    "theoretical estimates @xcite show that at certain scattering angles the dipole contribution can be well suppressed in favor of the quadrupole plasmon , which , therefore , can be observed . from the latter analysis , we may infer that also the sm may be extracted .",
    "indeed , in the low - energy region the sm can be stronger excited in the photo - absorption than the e2 mode .",
    "the analogy with atomic nuclei suggests that it should be favored even more in electron scattering at backward angles .",
    "the scissors mode ( sm ) in axially deformed sodium clusters has been studied within a self - consistent rpa approach based on the soft jellium model for the ionic background and density - functional theory for the electrons .",
    "the calculations show that the distribution of the low - energy scissors strength is dominated by @xmath59 states with only small shifts by the residual interaction .",
    "the sm thus reflects almost directly the density of @xmath59 m1 transitions near the fermi surface and exhibits an extreme sensitivity to the actual deformation .",
    "the sm is rather unambiguous in light clusters ( @xmath114 ) while it should be a statistical mix of contributions from different shapes in heavier clusters .",
    "furthermore , the high - energy branch of the sm in deformed systems is coupled with the quadrupole plasmon .",
    "the calculations show that the sm determines the van vleck paramagnetism and results in a strong anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility . moreover , due to quantum shell effects , some clusters ( @xmath81 ) demonstrate dia - para anisotropy when the axial cluster is diamagnetic along the symmetry axis and paramagnetic along other two axes .",
    "the magnetic moments are large enough to be measured . the experimental observation of the dia - para anisotropy , being interesting itself , could also serve as an indirect evidence of the sm in clusters .",
    "a general analysis of possible routes for experimental observation of the scissors mode was done . the photo - absorption with a polarized light ,",
    "inelastic electron scattering and raman scattering were considered .",
    "the former two reactions seem to be more promising . moreover , deposited clusters favor the detection of the sm .",
    "its features need yet to be worked out in detail .",
    "work along that direction is in progress",

    "<S> low - energy orbital magnetic dipole excitations , known as scissors mode ( sm ) , are studied in alkali metal clusters . </S>",
    "<S> subsequent dynamic and static effects are explored . </S>",
    "<S> the treatment is based on a self - consistent microscopic approach using the jellium approximation for the ionic background and the kohn - sham mean field for the electrons . </S>",
    "<S> the microscopic origin of sm and its main features ( structure of the mode in light and medium clusters , separation into low- and high - energy plasmons , coupling high - energy m1 scissors and e2 quadrupole plasmons , contributions of shape isomers , etc ) are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the scissors m1 strength acquires large values with increasing cluster size . </S>",
    "<S> the mode is responsible for the van vleck paramagnetism of spin - saturated clusters . </S>",
    "<S> quantum shell effects induce a fragile interplay between langevin diamagnetism and van vleck paramagnetism and lead to a remarkable dia - para anisotropy in magnetic susceptibility of particular light clusters . </S>",
    "<S> finally , several routes for observing the sm experimentally are discussed . </S>"
