    "tight correlations have been measured between the masses of central supermassive black holes in early - type galaxies and their bulge mass ( magorrian et al .  1998 ; hring & rix 2004 ) , luminosity ( kormendy & richstone 1995 ) , central velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",

    "2002 ) , and central light concentration ( graham et al .",
    "it is unclear if these correlations extend to less massive galaxies and to galaxies of later morphological type .",
    "if so , do the scaling properties still hold ? that is , do disk - dominated late - type spirals with small bulges host intermediate - mass black holes or is there a minimum galaxy mass below which black holes fail to form and/or to grow ?",
    "high - resolution _ hubble",
    "_  images ( carollo et al .",
    "1998 ; bker et al .  2002 , 2004 ) show that the majority , @xmath075% , of late - type spirals have distinct compact stellar nuclei or nuclear star clusters ( nscs ) .",
    "these are not , however , a smooth extension from the massive bulges of early - type galaxies .",
    "they are much more dense and more compact ( walcher et al .",
    "2005 ) ; hence , while typical nsc masses can be comparable to those of dwarf spheroid galaxies , they are 4 orders of magnitude denser . in this sense , nscs are more like milky way globular clusters with scaled - up masses and densities .",
    "in addition , they are much more luminous than the old globular clusters ( bker et al .  2004 ) due in large part to the comparatively young age , 100  myr , of their most luminous stellar component ( rossa et al .",
    "still , their dynamical masses suggest a hidden older population is present as well ( walcher et al .  2005 ; rossa et al .",
    "2006 ) so that they may grow through occasional bursts of star formation and may be forming stars in the current epoch at low levels .    while the nscs are , by definition , at or very near the dynamical centers of their host galaxies ( e.g. bker et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is not certain if they originated there nor whether or not they are presently accreting gas and forming stars .",
    "it has been suggested that some of the most massive globular clusters may be relic de nuclei tidally stripped and absorbed into larger galaxies ( e.g. freeman 1993 ; layden & sarajendini 2000 ) .",
    "if they commonly host ( intermediate - mass ) black holes , then they may be potential candidates for ultraluminous x - ray sources ( king & dehnen 2005 ) and , if they migrate to the cores of the larger host galaxies , may be the seed ( intermediate - mass ) black holes that evolve into supermassive black holes .",

    "calibrated _ hubble _  images acquired with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) operated in wfc mode were obtained from the multimission archive at stsci .",

    "the best - fitting model in all cases is the diskbb model ( makishima et al .",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , some 75% of late - type spirals host nscs . in this section we briefly compare ngc  2403  to two well - studied objects with very different interpretations for their x - ray emission mechanisms : ngc  598 ( m33 ) , another scd galaxy with a nsc and a bright point - like nuclear x - ray source , is thought to contain a luminous x - ray binary ; and ngc  4395 , the optically least - luminous broad - line agn known , is thought to contain a `` proper '' nuclear black hole at the low end of their mass distribution ( @xmath53  @xmath7 ) .",

    "the current consensus is that x-8 is a luminous x - ray binary in the nsc of ngc  598 rather than a weak agn ( e.g. , la  parola et al .",
    "the mass of the compact object must be @xmath010  @xmath7  or more unless it is radiating above the eddington limit in the x - ray band .",

    "one such fundamental correlation seems to hold between the bulge mass and the cmo mass ( ferrarese et al .",

    "the cmo mass is @xmath01/500 of the spheroidal mass ( bulge mass in spirals ) .",
    "qualitatively , this suggests that the initial galaxy assembly processes led to the rapid collapse of a nuclear gas component into a bh in the more massive galaxies , while a star cluster was formed in galaxies with a shallower gravitational potential , where the central accumulation of gas occurred more slowly",
    ".    however , many questions remain open .",
    "some relatively massive ellipticals do have nscs ( rossa et al .",
    "2006 ; although they have not been found in galaxies brighter than @xmath71  mag ; ferrarese et al .",
    "the range in which nscs and smbhs overlap may span several orders of magnitude : a smbh with @xmath72  @xmath7is the cmo in the center of the milky way , and a smbh with a mass @xmath73  @xmath7  is present in ngc  4395 , but nscs as massive as a few @xmath74  @xmath7  have been found in some elliptical galaxies ( rossa et al .",
    "it is not known whether the same galaxy can harbor both an smbh and a nsc , or if they are mutually exclusive .",
    "it is also not yet clear which of the two classes of objects defines the more fundamental correlation with the galactic bulge ; it was suggested ( rossa et al .",
    "2006 ) that nscs in large galaxies may be a factor of 3 more massive than smbhs , for a given bulge mass .",
    "furthermore , it is not known whether a linear relation between bulge and cmo masses may extend all the way down to bulgeless scd galaxies ( implying the existence of cmos with masses as low as @xmath75  @xmath7 ) , or if the relation breaks down for cmo masses @xmath76  @xmath7 .    from its optical brightness and colors",
    ", we estimate a stellar mass of @xmath02@xmath410@xmath77  @xmath7  for the nsc in ngc  2403 , comparable to the mass of the smbh in the milky way , even though ngc  2403  is bulgeless .",
    "although our x - ray study suggests that the nuclear x - ray source is not from a smbh , this does not rule out the presence of a smbh inside the nsc : it may simply be quiescent . in that case",

    ", we shall use an x - ray survey of galactic nuclei to determine whether galaxies with nscs may also have signs of agn activity .    even if we accept that a late - type galaxy such as ngc  2403formed a nsc but no smbh ,",
    "there is a strong possibility that the nsc contains stellar - mass bhs formed via ordinary stellar processes , or perhaps an intermediate - mass bh ( imbh ) formed via runaway core collapse and stellar coalescence ( if the nsc was sufficiently compact ) .",
    "then , those bhs could have grown over a hubble time , via accretion during large - scale gas inflows towards the galactic center , via coalescence of stellar mass bhs inside the nsc , or via orbital decay and coalescence of accreted satellite galaxies or primordial halo remnants .",
    "processes involving bh mergers may lead to the displacement or escape of the merged bh due to gravitational radiation recoil , and to the formation of a lower - density stellar core ( merritt et al .",
    "it is possible that some late - type galaxies have a three - tier hierarchical relation between a bulge , a nsc , and an imbh inside the nsc .",
    "theoretical arguments have suggested that if an imbh forms via core collapse in the core of a massive star cluster , its mass should be @xmath00.2% of the host cluster mass , coincidentally similar to the mass ratio between the bulge and its cmo . in principle , the effective radius of a nsc may provide clues on its dynamical processes . in ngc  2403 , the nsc is older and less compact ( @xmath80  pc ) than most other nscs in late - type spirals ( typical @xmath81  pc ) .",
    "if the cluster was formed with such a large @xmath82 , it would not have been compact enough to form an imbh via core collapse ( portegies  zwart et al .",
    "alternatively , one may speculate that the nsc was originally more compact and has evolved to such a large radius because of the presence of one or more bhs in its core ( ebisuzaki et al .",
    "1991 ; milosavljevi et al .",
    "2002 ; graham 2004 ) .",
    "other physical processes not related to bh coalescence may also cause a star cluster to expand .",
    "for example , studies of clusters in the lmc show clusters are born compact and evolve to a range of @xmath82  as they age ( elson et al .",
    "1989 ; mackey & gilmore 2003 ) . but studies also show this evolution is not due to differences in imf ( degrijs et al .",
    "2002 ) , time - varying external tidal fields , nor differences in the number of hard primordial binaries present ( wilkinson et al .  2003 ) .",
    "if no massive bh formed , the cluster could still evolve to large @xmath82 .",
    "for the lmc clusters ( none of which are thought to host a massive bh ! ) , @xmath82  evolution is likely due to differences in star formation efficiencies with lower efficiencies tending to expel gas before a dense stellar core ( with a population of massive stars ) can form and leading eventually to cluster expansion ( goodwin 1997 ; vine & bonnell 2003 ) .",
    "if evolution is through this mechanism , then we would expect a smooth distribution of cluster @xmath82  values that included the value @xmath83  pc found here for ngc  2403 .",
    "this does not appear to be the case ( cf .",
    "fig .  4 of bker",
    "et al .  2004 ) although the bker et al .",
    "sample is not large .",
    "another difference between nscs with or without a relatively massive bh is the role of feedback .",
    "more powerful feedback is expected from a nuclear imbh or smbh , leading to gas expulsions , perhaps large - scale outflows , and cyclic episodes of star formations . in this sense",
    ", the distribution of stellar populations in a nsc provides a fossil record of past galactic activity , and may be used to reconstruct episodes of galactic mergers or phases of nuclear activity .",
    "however , in the case of a relatively low - mass nsc such as the one in ngc  2403 , we find that normal stellar winds and sne can provide enough energy to expel cool interstellar gas from the cluster and quench star formation , without the need of agn feedback .",
    "interestingly , ngc  2403  is one of those rare galaxies with gas column densities below the critical value needed to sustain activity but has a normal star formation rate ( martin & kennicutt 2001 ) .",
    "perhaps a strong outflow from the central region has helped trigger star formation at larger radii .",
    "outflow may also account for some of the anomalous hi  discovered in the halo of ngc  2403  ( fraternalli et al .",
    "( 2002 , 2004 ) .",
    "these points will be addressed in a future paper ( yukita et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the time interval since the last star formation episode is longer for the nsc in ngc  2403  than is typical for clusters in late - type spirals .",
    "davidge & courteau ( 2002 ) also noted the lack of star formation activity more recent than @xmath0100  myr in the inner disk of ngc  2403  and suggested it may be due to expulsion of potential star - forming material from the central regions .",
    "indeed , active star formation is ongoing in several giant hii  regions ( drissen et al .",
    "1999 ; yukita et al . , in preparation ) surrounding the nucleus of ngc  2403 but the nsc itself contains perhaps the oldest collection of stars in the region .",
