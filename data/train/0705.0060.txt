    "the weyl curvature tensor of a riemannian metric on a manifold is invariant under changes of the metric by multiplying a function . when the manifold is more than three - dimensional , it measures how the metric is distant from a conformally flat metric .",
    "if the manifold is four - dimensional and oriented , the weyl curvature tensor decomposes into two components , called self - dual and anti - self - dual part .",
    "a metric on an oriented four - manifold is called if the anti - self - dual part of the weyl curvature vanishes identically .",
    "a significant property of self - dual metrics is that , by so called a penrose correspondence , there naturally associates a very special kind of a complex threefold , called the _",
    "twistor space_. as a differential manifold , it is a sphere bundle over the four - manifold . although its fibers are complex submanifolds of the twistor space , their normal bundles are non - trivial but the same as that of line in @xmath6 .",
    "nowadays thanks to a theorem of c.taubes @xcite , it is known that there exist a plenty of compact manifolds which admit a self - dual metric .",
    "more precisely , any oriented compact 4-manifold admits a self - dual metric , after gluing sufficiently many complex projective planes .",
    "accordingly , there exist a huge number of compact twistor spaces .",
    "n.hitchin @xcite showed that compact twistor spaces do not admit a khler metric , except two well - known examples .",
    "this result looks made it difficult to investigate compact twistor spaces by usual methods in complex algebraic geometry .",
    "but y.s.poon @xcite and c.lebrun @xcite changed the scene dramatically by constructing explicit examples of moishezon twistor spaces .",
    "( a compact complex manifold is called moishezon if it is bimeromorphic to a projective manifold . )",
    "later , f.campana and b.kreuler @xcite found a new series of moishezon twistor spaces and described their structure in a quite detailed form .",
    "the base 4-manifolds of all these twistor spaces are @xmath0 , the connected sums of @xmath7 copies of complex projective planes .",
    "this is partly because by a theorem of campana @xcite , if a compact four - manifold admits a self - dual metric whose twistor space is moishezon ( or of fujiki s class @xmath8 , more strongly ) , then the four - manifold is ( homeomorphic to ) the four - sphere or @xmath0 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the author explicitly constructed a family of moishezon twistor spaces with @xmath9-action on @xmath0 for arbitrary @xmath10 , which seem to be new in the case @xmath5 .",
    "the main tool for the construction was the anticanonical system of the twistor spaces .",
    "in fact , the image of its associated meromorphic map is a ( singular ) rational surface whose structure is independent of the number @xmath7 of connected sum .",
    "further , the meromorphic map can be regarded as a quotient map by the @xmath9-action .",
    "namely the image surface was so called a minitwistor space . by analyzing the structure of the meromorphic quotient map",
    ", we constructed the twistor spaces on @xmath0 as explicit bimeromorphic modifications of ( again explicitly constructed ) conic bundles over ( the minimal resolution of ) the minitwistor spaces .    in this paper",
    "we provide yet another family of moishezon twistor spaces on @xmath0 for arbitrary @xmath1 . as those in @xcite explained above",
    ", these twistors have a @xmath9-action induced by the @xmath11-symmetries of the corresponding self - dual metrics .",
    "further , when @xmath12 , they coincide with those in @xcite .",
    "( namely they coincide with non - lebrun twistor spaces on @xmath2 with @xmath9-action studied in @xcite . ) but when @xmath5 , they are new twistor spaces , to the best of the author s knowledge . among other properties ,",
    "the most characteristic feature of the present twistor spaces is that _ their projective models have a natural structure of double covering over some @xmath3-bundle over @xmath4 , as a natural generalization of the double covering structure of the twistor spaces on @xmath2 studied in @xcite . _",
    "( on the other hand , the twistor spaces we constructed in @xcite were also generalization of non - lebrun twistor spaces on @xmath2 with @xmath9-action .",
    "but they are different generalization respecting the structure of minitwistor spaces . )",
    "we outline how these results are obtained , by explaining contents of each sections . in  [ ss - s ] we precisely explain what kind of twistor spaces we shall consider , by specifying the structure of a divisor @xmath13 which is a member of the half - anticanonical system of the twistor space . in ",
    "[ ss - multans ] we state properties of some pluri - anticanonical systems of the surface @xmath13 .",
    "they will be a basis for the following investigation . in ",
    "[ ss - lst ] we consider pluri - half - anticanonical systems on the twistor spaces and provide basic commutative diagrams of meromorphic maps which are indispensable for analyzing the structure of the present twistor spaces .",
    "we also prove the first key result ( lemma [ lemma - nt1 ] ) that the sum of some degree - one divisors belongs to a system @xmath14 , the subsystem of @xmath15 consisting of divisors defined by @xmath9-invariant sections of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 denotes the canonical half - anticanonical bundle of the twistor spaces .",
    "[ ss - mt ] we determine the image of the meromorphic map associated to this system in explicit form ( theorem [ thm - mt1 ] ) .",
    "in particular , we show that it is a normal rational surface in @xmath18 whose degree is @xmath19 . the meromorphic map can be regarded as a ( meromorphic ) quotient map of the @xmath9-action : thus the image surface is a minitwistor space .",
    "we also determine its singularities and give their minimal resolutions ( prop.[prop - mt2 ] ) .",
    "in contrast to the situation we obtained in @xcite , the structure of these minitwistor spaces depend on @xmath7 , and they form @xmath20-dimensional moduli . when @xmath12 , they coincides with the minitwistor space studied in @xcite and @xcite . when @xmath5 , they are new minitwistor spaces , as far as the author knows .    in section 3 by analyzing the meromorphic quotient map in the previous section",
    "we realize projective models of the twistor spaces as conic bundles over ( the minimal resolution of ) the minitwistor spaces . in  [ ss - pr ] we concretely give a partial elimination of the indeterminacy locus of the meromorphic map .",
    "then in  [ ss - dl ] and  [ ss - nt ] we explicitly construct a @xmath3-bundle over the resolution of the minitwistor space and realize a projective model of the twistor space as a conic subbundle of this @xmath3-bundle , by explicitly giving its defining equation .",
    "the idea used here is similar to those in @xcite , section 3 .",
    "an interesting observation is that , as in @xcite , a discriminant curve of the conic bundle is a hyperplane section of the minitwistor spaces with respect to its natural realization in a projective space ( lemma [ lemma - hps1 ] ) .",
    "we show that the inverse image of this discriminant curve splits into two irreducible components and correspondingly we obtain a pair of ( mutually conjugate ) @xmath9-invariant divisors @xmath21 and @xmath22 in the twistor space ( prop.[prop - y1 ] ) .",
    "we next determine the cohomology classes of @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( in @xmath23 ) by showing that adding some divisor to @xmath21 ( and @xmath22 ) gives members of the system @xmath24 ( prop.[prop - nt4 ] ) .",
    "existence of these members is a key in obtaining the following presentations of the twistor spaces .    in section 4",
    "we investigate a complete linear system @xmath15 .",
    "based on the results of the previous section , especially the existence of the above divisors in the system @xmath24 , we concretely give generators of @xmath15 . then using them we explicitly determine the image of the meromorphic map associated to @xmath15 ( theorem [ thm - bim ] ) .",
    "we also show that the map is bimeromorphic onto the image .",
    "in particular , we obtain the second projective models of the twistor spaces .",
    "they are birational to codimension two subvarieties in certain @xmath25-bundle over @xmath4 , whose restriction to each fibers are quartic surfaces .    in the final section ,",
    "combining results obtained so far , we investigate the meromorphic map associated to the system @xmath24 .",
    "we show that the map is generically 2 to 1 over its image , and the image is a rational scroll of planes in @xmath26 , whose degree is @xmath27 . by blowing - up its vertices which form a line",
    ", we obtain a @xmath3-bundle @xmath28 over @xmath4 .",
    "then we explicitly give a meromorphic map from the projective model in section 4 to this @xmath3-bundle , and show that the map is generically 2 to 1 .",
    "we further determine the defining equation of the branch locus of this map in an explicit form .",
    "these results are summarized as theorem [ thm - dc2 ] . when @xmath12 , the equation of the branch divisor coincides with the one we obtained in @xcite for a non - lebrun twistor space on @xmath2 with @xmath9-action .",
    "thus it becomes apparent that _ the present twistor spaces are natural generalization of the twistor spaces on @xmath2 studied in @xcite , respecting the structure of double covering .",
    "_ we also show that the branch divisor of the double covering is irreducible , non - normal surface , and birational to ruled surface of genus @xmath29 $ ] ( prop.[prop - b ] ) .",
    "we further obtain some constraint on the defining equation of the branch divisor ( prop.[prop - dr ] ) , which is a generalization of the constraint appeared in the case of @xmath12 in @xcite .",
    "consequently the moduli space of the present twistor spaces can be computed to be @xmath7-dimensional .",
    "finally we remark that the present twistor spaces can be obtained as a small deformation of lebrun metrics with torus action which preserves a particular @xmath11-action , and compare with the results we obtained in @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we investigate the twistor spaces by using three linear systems : ( a ) the non - complete system @xmath14 from which we derive a conic bundle description over the minitwistor spaces ( these are studied in sections 2 and 3 ) , ( b ) the complete linear system @xmath15 which gives projective models that are birational to the total space of a fiber space over @xmath4 whose fibers are quartic surfaces ( these are studied in section 4 ) , ( c ) the complete linear system @xmath24 which gives a generically 2 to 1 covering over a rational scroll of planes in @xmath26 ( these are studied in section 5 ) .",
    "of course , the last presentation is most simple because the double covering is uniquely determined by only specifying the branch divisor which is expressed by a _",
    "single _ polynomial .",
    "it seems difficult for the author to obtain the last presentation without studying both ( a ) and ( b ) in detail ( as we did in this paper ) .",

    "as in @xcite , we start our investigation by specifying structure of a real irreducible member of the fundamental system on the twistor spaces .",
