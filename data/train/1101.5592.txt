    "in its different incarnations , quantum gravity must face a diverse set of fascinating problems and difficulties , a set of issues best seen as both challenges and opportunities .",
    "one of the main problems in canonical approaches , for instance , is the issue of anomalies in the gauge algebra underlying space - time covariance .",
    "classically , the gauge generators , given by constraints , have weakly vanishing poisson brackets with one another : they vanish when the constraints are satisfied .",
    "after quantization , the same behavior must be realized for commutators of quantum constraints ( or for poisson brackets of effective constraints ) , or else the theory becomes inconsistent due to gauge anomalies .",
    "if and how canonical quantum gravity can be obtained in an anomaly - free way is an important question , not yet convincingly addressed in full generality .",
    "posing one of the main obstacles to a complete formulation of quantum gravity , this issue is hindering progress toward a detailed evaluation of quantum gravitational dynamics .",
    "a reliable phenomenological analysis must , after all , start with a consistent set of sufficiently general dynamical equations .",
    "but the strong and tough requirement of anomaly - freedom is also an opportunity , for it allows an analysis of quantum space - time and the changes in its structure possibly implied by quantum gravity .",
    "addressing the anomaly problem is , moreover , crucial for an understanding of the dynamics of quantum gravity , both in the sense of _ constructing _ consistent dynamical equations at the quantum level and in the sense of _ evaluating _ equations and their solutions to bring out physical effects .",
    "although the anomaly problem has not been addressed in full generality , several model systems have by now been analyzed in loop quantum cosmology , as reviewed by @xcite , with this question in mind .",
    "loop quantum cosmology is a rather wide area within loop quantum gravity , analyzing several classes of model systems and perturbations around them .",
    "loop quantum gravity , detailed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , is a canonical quantization of general relativity based on holonomies ( the eponymous loops ) as elementary variables .",
    "the use of holonomies allows a background - independent formulation free of auxiliary metrics , and it implies several specific properties of the resulting dynamics .    in all the systems used in loop quantum cosmology , quantization techniques close to those of a general loop quantization are used ; they can thus be seen as capturing at least some of the crucial properties of full loop quantum gravity . to different degrees ,",
    "most of these models make additional use of symmetry reduction as introduced by @xcite , simplifying much of the quantum geometry and thereby providing rather direct access to the much less understood quantum dynamics . thanks to these steps , implications of the quantum dynamics of loop quantum gravity , as generally defined based on @xcite and @xcite , have been evaluated quite explicitly for the first time .    in general terms as well as for particular questions arising in loop quantum cosmology and loop quantum gravity , three key issues regarding quantum space - time arise , not unlike what one would expect for any fundamental gauge theory with microscopic degrees of freedom :    effective dynamics : : :    in quantum gravity , geometry is described unsharply by whole states    with all their fluctuations and correlations , in addition to the    expectation values for an average geometry .",
    "equations of motion for    expectation values receive quantum corrections in their effective    dynamics , as it may describe a quantum geometry . along with this    consequence of quantizing gravity",
    "come not only new mathematical    space - time structures but also a vast enlargement of the number of    degrees of freedom by quantum variables .",
    "+    the strongest control of such a high - dimensional dynamical quantum    system is usually obtained for dynamical coherent states , defined as    states saturating uncertainty relations at all times .",
    "if such states    exist , they provide insights into the minimal deviations from    classical behavior expected for a quantum system .",
    "the form and    behavior of dynamical coherent states in loop quantum cosmology can be    highlighted in several models , bringing out the role of space - time    fluctuations and correlations as degrees of freedom beyond the    classical ones .",
    "exact dynamical coherent states exist only in special    models and for specific initial values . nevertheless , they allow    interesting views on the generic quantum dynamics as it arises in    quantum gravity .",
    "+    before all corrections are derived for a large class of models , a    clear analysis provided by dynamical coherent states , when they exist ,    unambiguously shows the first deviations from classical behavior .",
    "more    generally , when exact dynamical coherent states do not exist ,    additional quantum corrections will result .",
    "they can often be computed    perturbatively , analogously to loop corrections in interacting quantum    field theories .",
    "discrete dynamics : : :    in addition to those generic effects due to non - classical state    parameters , underlying space - time structures typically change even for    the expectation values of a quantum - gravity state . most importantly ,    discrete geometry , at least in purely spatial terms which is by now",
    "well understood in loop quantum gravity following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ;    * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , shows several detailed properties of importance for the    dynamics and thus for space - time geometry .",
    "+    a spatial slice in space - time is equipped with a discrete quantum    geometry , roughly seen as making space built from atomic patches of    certain discrete sizes .",
    "one of the main problems of quantum dynamics    is to show how these spatial atoms along slices fit together to form a    quantum space - time  or , more dynamically , how the spatial atoms    change , merge , subdivide and interact as time is let loose .",
    "for an    expanding universe , one would expect the discrete spatial structure to    be refined as the volume increases ; otherwise discrete sizes would be    enlarged by huge factors , especially during inflation , making them    macroscopic .",
    "the full dynamics of loop quantum gravity has indeed    provided several hints that the number of discrete building blocks    must change from slice to slice , once the dynamics is implemented    consistently .",
    "this lattice refinement can be modelled even in the    simplest , most highly symmetric situations of loop quantum cosmology ,    laid out by @xcite . and",
    "it has shown several specific    implications by which its precise form can already be constrained .",
    "consistent dynamics : : :    dynamics unfolds in time , but time is relative . making sure that    descriptions using different notions of time , corresponding to    measurements by different observers , can agree about their physical    insights",
    "requires the consistency conditions of general covariance .    since general covariance in gravity",
    "is implemented by gauge    transformations , any quantization or even just a modification of the    theory must , for consistency , respect this principle and be anomaly    free .",
    "+    while the previous two points manifest themselves already in    homogeneous models , where they can most easily be studied , the anomaly    problem arises only in inhomogeneous situations . within homogeneity ,",
    "all but one of the gauge transformations underlying covariance are    fixed .",
    "anomalies can only arise if there are at least two independent    gauge transformations ; after quantization , they would be anomalous if    their composition is no longer a gauge transformation .",
    "one could , of    course , make it a gauge transformation by definition , by declaring the    whole group generated by the independent gauge transformations as the    gauge group .",
    "but if this group is too large , it would identify    variables which are to be considered physically distinct , removing    observables and degrees of freedom and in many cases leaving no    non - trivial solutions . changing the gauge transformations of a    classical theory by quantum effects requires much care ; only so - called    consistent deformations of the classical gauge generators can provide    well - defined quantizations .",
    "addressing these questions is crucial , not only for a complete formulation of quantum gravity but also for reliable cosmological applications based on the resulting set of equations ( such as singularity removal or structure formation ) . in what follows",
    ", we will describe the current status based on the models of loop quantum cosmology .",
    "in a general sense , effective equations of a quantum system describe the behavior of expectation values in a state .",
    "deriving such equations for the expectation values of basic operators , such as @xmath0 and @xmath1 in quantum mechanics , shows how quantum effects change the classical equations of motion .",
    "if the equations can be solved or analyzed , the manifestation of quantum behavior will be seen .",
    "such effects play an important role in any interacting quantum theory , so also in quantum gravity and especially in quantum cosmology which devotes itself to the analysis of extremely long evolution times . during those times ,",
    "quantum states may change drastically , and quantum corrections grow to be significant .",
    "effective equations are state dependent since they are equations for expectation values in a state with many more independent parameters . in general , quantum fluctuations will influence the behavior of expectation values , and must then be included in effective equations in some form . more generally , and following @xcite , we can parameterize a state by all its moments @xmath2 defined for @xmath3 , in addition to the expectation values @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "we will use the two notations indicated on the left interchangeably , at least for small @xmath6 . ) for instance , @xmath7 is the square of position fluctuations , and @xmath8 the covariance .",
    "the values of moments are not completely arbitrary , most importantly being restricted by uncertainty relations such as @xmath9 for pure states , the set of moments as defined here is overcomplete ; the framework more generally allows for mixed states , too .",

    "the moments are all coupled to one another and to the equations for expectation values .",
    "one can see this by expanding @xmath16 ( where we assumed the hamiltonian operator @xmath17 to be weyl - ordered in @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) and noticing the coupling terms of expectation values and moments for any non - quadratic potential .",
    "the hamiltonian flow ( [ dodt ] ) or ( [ gdot ] ) then couples expectation values @xmath4 and @xmath5 to all the moments .    at this stage",
    ", we have an exact but usually horribly complicated hamiltonian description of quantum evolution .",
    "the partial differential equation for a state in schrdinger s formulation is replaced by infinitely many ordinary differential equations for the moments .",
    "most of the labor that goes into deriving tractable effective equations consists in extracting the required information about expectation values without having to solve for a full state , or all its moments , and to specify the regimes where this is reliable . in a semiclassical approximation based on near - gaussian states , for instance ,",
    "a moment of order @xmath6 is typically of the order @xmath18 , giving rise to a natural expansion in powers of @xmath19 . to any given order , only finitely",
    "many moments need be considered .      in special systems , equations of motion for the moments decouple automatically to finite sets .",
    "the best known case is the harmonic oscillator , whose quantum hamiltonian is @xmath20 second - order moments appear , but they do not couple to the expectation values .",
    "they rather provide the zero - point energy due to quantum fluctuations .",
    "hamiltonian equations of motion are only finitely coupled , @xmath21 for the expectation values we have exactly the classical equations without quantum corrections , as is well - known for the harmonic oscillator . here",
    ", effective equations for @xmath4 and @xmath5 are identical to the classical ones .",
    "the remaining equations then show how the state evolves once initial values for moments have been chosen . for stationary states , for instance",
    ", a vanishing covariance @xmath22 ensures that fluctuations are time - independent .",
    "the covariance is constant in time if @xmath23 , or @xmath24 . with this , the non - classical contribution to the energy @xmath25 in ( [ hqharm ] ) is @xmath26 , where @xmath27 from ( [ uncert ] ) .",
    "a minimal two - point energy @xmath28 results for the ground state , derived purely by effective means ( even though the ground state is not at all semiclassical ) .",
    "decoupled equations of this form are very useful because they can directly show important aspects of quantum dynamics .",
    "expectation - value equations decouple from the rest whenever the algebra of basic operators together with the hamiltonian is linear : in this case , the time derivative of the expectation value of any one of the basic operators is an expectation value of a basic operator .",
    "such systems are solvable in a strong sense ; there is no quantum back - reaction from the moments on the dynamics of expectation values .",
    "and the dynamics of moments of a given order depends only on moments of the same order . in terms of quantum field theory",
    ", solvable models correspond to free theories .      with interactions , or for anharmonic terms ,",
    "quantum back - reaction results .",
    "moments couple non - trivially to expectation values and become important for their dynamics . in this way ,",
    "the state dependence of effective equations ensues .",
    "the system of equations necessarily becomes of higher dimension than classically , with new dynamical quantum degrees of freedom given by the moments .    for a quantum mechanical system with an anharmonic potential , for instance",
    ", we have the classical hamiltonian @xmath29 with anharmonicity @xmath30 . in terms of dimensionless quantum variables @xmath31 the quantum hamiltonian is @xmath32 and generates equations of motion @xmath33    the leading quantum correction appears in the equation for @xmath5 at order @xmath19 ( @xmath34 ) , for which we have to know the position fluctuation @xmath35 . in general",
    ", this is an independent variable subject to its own equation of motion .",

    "higher moments dropped , this system shows the leading quantum corrections in a finitely - coupled system .    for anharmonic oscillators ,",
    "a further treatment is possible which makes use of an adiabatic approximation : we assume that time derivatives of the moments are small compared to the other terms . in this case ,",
    "equations of motion for moments become algebraic relationships between them . for the leading adiabatic order @xmath40 , combined with the previous @xmath19-expansion",
    ", we must solve @xmath41 which is of the stationary harmonic form , but with position - dependent coefficients .",
    "although @xmath42 , this is consistent with the adiabatic assumption .",
    "the general solution is @xmath43 for even @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and @xmath46 whenever @xmath44 or @xmath45 are odd .",
    "the values of @xmath47 for @xmath48 even remain free , but must satisfy a condition following from the next adiabatic order @xmath49 .    for the first adiabatic order , we now consider @xmath40 weakly time - dependent via @xmath4 , but assume @xmath50 time independent",
    ". solutions to the resulting equations @xmath51 provide the first adiabatic order - th adiabatic order @xmath52 is assumed to satisfy @xmath53 and thus solves @xmath54 .",
    "iterating over @xmath48 , this provides algebraic equations for all orders . ] @xmath49 , whose time dependence is given by derivatives of the zeroth ( adiabatic ) order moments : @xmath55 this equation implies @xmath56 and requires @xmath57 .",
    "the remaining constant @xmath58 can be fixed by requiring the moments to be of harmonic - oscillator form for @xmath59 : @xmath60 .",
    "in particular , @xmath61 , and the quantum correction to the effective force is @xmath62 as it arises from an effective potential @xmath63 from @xmath64 in ( [ hqexpand ] ) .",
    "this function agrees with path - integral calculations of the low - energy effective action as derived by @xcite . here ,",
    "only the zeroth adiabatic order combined with first order in @xmath19 has been used . to second order computed by @xcite ,",
    "there is also a correction for the mass term , still in agreement with @xcite .",
    "the adiabatic approximation is an example for situations in which the coupled quantum evolution of moments can be further reduced to result in explicit effective forces .",
    "while the forces come from coupling terms between expectation values and quantum variables such as fluctuations , the latter do not appear explicitly .",
    "quantum effects then manifest themselves indirectly in the form of effective terms depending on the expectation values , their quantum origin being indicated only by the presence of @xmath19 but not by explicit quantum degrees of freedom .",
    "such effective terms can not always be derived since some regimes , where effective descriptions may well apply , do require the larger freedom of higher - dimensional effective systems coupling quantum degrees of freedom explicitly . for low - energy effective potentials , the adiabatic approximation is responsible for the reduction to a system of classical form as far as degrees of freedom are concerned .    from the derivation we can also see how the state dependence is a crucial part of effective equations , even though the final expression ( [ veff ] ) for the potential seems state independent . to fix all free constants in effective equations for anharmonic systems , in particular @xmath65",
    ", we had to refer to the harmonic - oscillator ground state .",
    "we are thus expanding around the vacuum of the free , solvable theory whose moments are known .",
    "quantum corrections from the interacting vacuum have been derived in passing , by obtaining the leading adiabatic orders of @xmath66 .",
    "for the low - energy effective potential , this result was re - inserted in the equations of motion , somewhat hiding the state dependence .    with the higher - dimensional viewpoint of effective systems , keeping some of the moments as independent parameters , we obtain extra information about the interacting theory not seen in a simple effective potential .",
    "for instance , from our intermediate calculations we directly have @xmath67 , while @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "to zeroth adiabatic order , the interacting ground state keeps saturating the uncertainty relation , but fluctuations are no longer exactly constant .      in relativistic systems , there is no absolute time with evolution generated by a hamiltonian .",
    "rather , relativistic systems are subject to a hamiltonian constraint @xmath70 .",
    "it generates arbitrary changes of the time coordinate as gauge transformations @xmath71 for phase - space functions @xmath72 . from observable quantities",
    "@xmath73 left unchanged by gauge transformations , that is @xmath74 , dynamical properties follow .",

    "we can write gauge transformations as @xmath85 even for phase - space functions @xmath86 . more details of poisson geometry in the context of constrained systems are described by @xcite . ]",
    "constrained formulations can be introduced also for non - relativistic systems by parameterization , adding a time degree of freedom @xmath87 with momentum @xmath88 and replacing the hamiltonian @xmath89 by the hamiltonian constraint @xmath90 . for time - independent hamiltonians ,",

    "@xmath92 imposes hamilton s equations of motion .    for relativistic quantum systems ,",
    "the effective techniques described so far can not directly be applied .",

    "however , for effective equations one can show that the absolute value can be dropped , providing a linear quantum system .",

    "a crucial difference , according to the analysis by @xcite , is that no adiabatic regime has so far been found for quantum cosmology , blocking the complete expression of quantum variables in terms of an effective potential . on the other hand ,",
    "higher - dimensional effective systems , where quantum variables are taken as independent variables subject to their own evolution , can be analyzed and show how states back - react on the expectation - value trajectories .",
    "if we include a mass term or a potential for the scalar , the system becomes `` time - dependent '' in @xmath93 .",
    "extra care is required , but perturbation theory still applies for small and flat potentials .",
    "the justification for this procedure in the time - dependent case comes from an extension of the effective - equation procedure to constrained systems introduced by @xcite without requiring deparameterization .",
    "quantum constraint operators then imply the existence of infinitely many constraints @xmath109 on the quantum phase space , in general all independent for different polynomials @xmath110 in the basic operators .",
    "this large number of constraints restricts not only expectation values ( as the classical analog ) but also the corresponding quantum variables . a complete reduction to the physical state space results , without requiring a deparameterization to exist . with these general techniques , effective equations for relativistic systems",

    ". one might wonder whether it is enough to look for quantum corrections in the hamiltonian or the constraints without correcting the symplectic structure . with symplectic - structure corrections ,",
    "an effective action might take a different form than suggested by an analysis only of hamiltonians and constraints",
    ".    there might indeed be corrections to the symplectic structure , but they would follow from the same algebraic notions used for canonical effective equations .",
    "poisson brackets of quantum variables are given by expectation values of commutators as used before ; see ( [ ab ] ) .",
    "any potential corrections to the symplectic structure have thus been taken care of by applying that formula consistently .",
    "if there are no changes in poisson - bracket relations for effective equations , it is only because they do not change for expectation values of basic operators : they have commutator relations mimicking the classical poisson algebra , which is linear for the basic objects .",
    "taking expectation values of these linear structures does not lead to corrections .",
    "for canonical basic operators @xmath0 and @xmath1 , for instance , we have @xmath114\\rangle / i\\hbar=1 $ ] .",
    "the poisson structure changes only because the dimension of the phase space increases by the quantum variables @xmath115 .",
    "these variables satisfy poisson relationships following from the quantum theory , but this does not affect the poisson brackets of expectation values of basic operators . in an action , the symplectic term for classical variables remains unchanged .",
    "but if a higher - dimensional effective system with independent quantum variables is used , their symplectic terms add to the action .",
    "the symplectic structure is only extended to include new degrees of freedom ; it is not quantum corrected .",
    "sometimes , one can make assumptions about the dependence of quantum variables on expectation values , or even derive those by an adiabatic approximation .",

    "expectation values of hamiltonians or constraints are then the key source for quantum corrections .    for quantum gravity , we expect higher - curvature terms in an effective action , and thus higher - derivative terms . by the preceding discussion , this can only come from independent moments @xmath115 . but quantum gravity has additional implications , such as the emergence of discrete spatial structures expected in particular from loop quantum gravity .",
    "they , too , must affect the effective dynamics .",
    "our main interest from now on will be to apply effective equation techniques to canonical quantum gravity .",
    "a strict derivation requires detailed knowledge of the mathematical properties of operators involved , as well as information about the representation of states .",
    "effective equations and effective constraints are , after all , obtained via expectation values of hamilonians or hamiltonian constraint operators .",
    "these operators are first constructed within the full quantum theory of gravity or one of its models , and the resulting constructs will be sensitive to properties of the basic operators , analogous to @xmath0 and @xmath1 in quantum mechanics . some of these properties will descend to the effective level once expectation values of hamiltonians are computed , and then affect also the effective dynamics . at this stage , general effective techniques naturally tie in with specific constructions of a concrete quantum theory at hand .",
    "classically , the canonical structure of general relativity is given by the spatial part @xmath121 of the space - time metric @xmath122 , as well as momenta related to its change in time , or the extrinsic curvature @xmath123 of the spatial slices @xmath124 .",
    "these specific quantities are meaningful only when a choice for time , a time function @xmath87 such that @xmath125 , has been made , and so this formalism is often seen as breaking covariance . but space - time covariance is broken only superficially and is restored when all the dynamical constraints have been solved  in addition to a local hamiltonian constraint , three components of the diffeomorphism constraint to generate all four independent space - time coordinate changes .",
    "the theory is , after all , equivalent to general relativity in its lagrangian form ; just formulating it in different variables can not destroy underlying symmetries .",
    "in fact , the hamiltonian formulation still shows the full generators of all gauge transformations in explicit form , by the constraints it implies for the fields . by the general theory of constraint analysis ,",
    "a discussion of gauge at the hamiltonian level is then even more powerful than at the lagrangian one .      before addressing quantum constraints",

    "the physical hilbert space leads over to evaluating the dynamics , for physical states would provide predictions from expectation values of observables . but this stage has been brought to completion only in a few simple ( and very special ) models ; in general the outlook toward a full implementation is rather pessimistic .    here , effective constraint techniques become useful because they allow one to address physical properties , corresponding to observables in the physical hilbert space without having to deal explicitly with states .",
    "conditions from the physical inner product are rather implemented by reality conditions for expectation values and quantum variables such as fluctuations , which can be done more simply and more generally than for entire states .",
    "effective constraints thus provide a good handle on generic properties of physical observables , at least in semiclassical regimes where not all the moments need be considered . especially in cosmological situations they provide an ideal framework . in inhomogeneous contexts , they allow a detailed discussion of the anomaly issue , and show whether the different effects expected from the basic operators of quantum gravity can lead to a consistent form of the dynamics .    consistency conditions in the presence of ambiguities are useful , for they constrain the choices .",
    "but the question remains whether loop quantum gravity can be fully consistent at all  implementing covariance at the quantum level might , after all , not leave any consistent physical states .",
    "if the consistency conditions are weak , on the other hand , ambiguities would remain even at the physical level . in between , at a razor - thin balance between ambiguity and constraints , lies the case of a unique consistent theory , a possibility which exists in loop quantum gravity but for which at present no evidence has been found .    in model systems it has at least been shown that consistency in the form of covariance can be achieved even in the presence of quantum corrections resulting from the discreteness .",
    "this statement may come as a surprise , for discrete spatial or space - time structures are naively expected to break local lorentz or even rotational symmetries .",
    "nevertheless , at the level of effective equations one can see that covariance can be respected  but it can not leave the classical algebra of local symmetries invariant . while quantum - gravity corrections provide a consistent deformation of general relativity  preserving the number of independent gauge generators  the algebra is truly deformed .",

    "not all components of einstein s equation are thus independent , and some can be derived from the others . for consistency",
    ", effective equations of quantum gravity must show the same form of dependencies , or allow the same number of local conservation laws , or else degrees of freedom would be too much constrained to have a chance of providing the correct classical limit .",
    "consistency is automatically satisfied if one has space - time covariant higher - order corrections in lagrangian form . at the hamiltonian level , however , covariance is more difficult to check due to the lack of a direct action of space - time diffeomorphisms .",
    "there is rather a splitting into spatial diffeomorphisms acting as usual , and an independent generator deforming spatial constant - time slices within space - time . as in relativistic systems , all generators are constraints , taking center stage in a canonical analysis : the conservation law implies that the components @xmath309 of einstein s equation are only of first order in time derivatives since @xmath310 must equal terms of at most second order in time .",
    "the same equation shows that these constraints are automatically preserved in time , given that @xmath310 depends only on the einstein equations at fixed time and their spatial derivatives .",
    "if einstein s equation holds at one time , time derivatives of the components @xmath309 vanish ; the constraints can consistently be imposed at all times . also this condition must be preserved for effective equations .",
    "otherwise , the system is overdetermined with more equations than unknowns and not enough consistent solutions would result .    from this perspective",

    "the system of constraints must remain first class after including quantum corrections , but the specific algebra may change .",
    "canonically , the realm of consistent theories is larger than at the lagrangian level : while corrections to the action may be of higher - curvature form , they all give rise to exactly the same constraint algebra . the hamiltonian level",

    "thereby , changes to the quantum space - time structure can be captured .",

    "we will illustrate the results of several models in loop quantum cosmology in the following section .",
    "the general issues of constrained systems in gravity can easily be seen already for linear cosmological perturbations . for scalar modes , perturbing the lapse function as @xmath318 and the scale factor as @xmath319 , and with a scalar matter source , the linearized components of einstein s equation , in conformal time and longitudinal gauge , read @xmath320 with the conformal hubble parameter @xmath321 .",

    "canonically , this follows from the fact that all equations result from a set of first - class constraints .    in these equations ,",
    "perturbations @xmath93 , @xmath324 and @xmath325 are directly used for the metric and the scalar .",
    "these quantities are subject to gauge transformations under changes of space - time coordinates , which also change the gauge .",
    "so far , the equations as written are in longitudinal gauge where the space - time metric remains diagonal under perturbations . more generally ,",

    "two new scalar perturbations @xmath328 and @xmath329 are introduced in addition to @xmath93 and @xmath324 , and all four transform into each other under coordinate changes . for linear coordinate changes , however , the combinations @xmath330 and @xmath331 and a similar one for the matter perturbation remain unchanged as specified by @xcite ; they form gauge - invariant observables of the linear theory . from a canonical perspective",

    "the ungauged evolution equations , containing @xmath328 and @xmath329 in addition to @xmath93 and @xmath324 , can be expressed completely in terms of the gauge - invariant variables , as required on physical grounds . here",

    ", the first - class nature serves as a complete requirement for covariance .",
    "a first - class algebra of constraints ensures that physical evolution can be formulated fully in gauge - invariant terms . by the same property of the constrained system ,",
    "also frame - independence is guaranteed : the gauge algebra corresponds to deformations of the spatial hypersurfaces given by a time function @xmath332 .",
    "gauge invariant variables are insensitive to these deformations , and thus to the choice of time . but",
    "a time function ( without specifying which spatial coordinates are to be held fixed ) does not uniquely tell us how to take time derivatives for the equations of motion ; this is only accomplished when we also specify a time - evolution vector field @xmath333 ( such that @xmath334 ) . for a given time function , there are many choices for @xmath333 , and the time - evolution vector field may be changed independently of the foliation .",
    "a fixed foliation of space - time into spatial slizes with unit normals @xmath335 allows us to express the freedom in choosing time - evolution vector fields by the lapse function @xmath336 and the shift vector @xmath337 ( with @xmath338 ) such that @xmath339 .",

    "since @xmath336 and @xmath337 appear as multipliers of first - class constraints , they can be chosen arbitrarily ( except that we would like @xmath341 for evolution toward the future ) . for a consistent set of first - class constraints",
    ", we can thus choose the frame freely , and different frame choices are guaranteed to produce consistent results .",
    "( in a space - time treatment , observables which are gauge as well as frame - independent can be derived following @xcite . in a reduced phase - space treatment , where one uses observables solving the classical constraints , one is working at a gauge - invariant , but not automatically frame - independent level . )    in classical relativity , cosmological perturbation equations can often be derived in much simper ways when a space - time gauge is chosen , such as the longitudinal gauge above or the uniform one where only matter fields are perturbed . since gauge transformations are known to correspond to space - time coordinate transformations",
    ", one can directly verify that such gauges are possible .",
    "moreover , choosing a gauge before deriving equations of motion from an action or hamiltonian is equivalent to choosing a gauge in the general equations of motion .",
    "the situation is thus completely unambiguous .    when quantum effects are included , either in a full quantum theory or in an effective manner , the constraints change by quantum correction terms .",
    "equations of motion change , as expected , and so do the form of gauge - invariant expressions since it is the constraints which generate gauge transformations . in such a situation , gauge transformations and suitable gauge fixings can be analyzed only after the quantization has been performed and the corrected constraints are known .",
    "if gauge fixings are employed before quantization or before determining effective constraints , the choice of gauge fixing may not be compatible with the resulting corrected gauge transformations .",
    "moreover , choosing different gauge fixings before doing the same kind of quantization would in general lead to different final results , making the procedure ambiguous even beyond unavoidable quantization ambiguities .",
    "similarly , a reduced phase space quantization is based on frame - fixing , although no gauge need be fixed .    for the different approaches used in relation to loop quantum gravity ,",
    "several examples exist .",

    "@xcite construct discretized theories in three dimensions , respecting the space - time gauge , but argue in @xcite that this may not be possible in four space - time dimensions .",
    "@xcite and @xcite quantize 2-dimensional parameterized models of field theories by the dirac procedure and represent observables on the resulting physical hilbert space . in this treatment ,",
    "the discretization does not lead to inconsistencies but possibly to deformations of classical algebras of observables . finally , reduced phase space methods fixing the frame by referring to an extra dust field are developed by @xcite for cosmological perturbations , and by @xcite in spherical symmetry . other treatments for cosmological perturbations",
    "are used , e.g. , by @xcite and @xcite in gauge - fixed versions and by @xcite in a frame - fixed ( reduced phase - space ) way .",
    "@xcite provide a proposal by which cosmological perturbations , taking into account space - time discreteness , might be implementable by a consistent first - class algebra of constraints .",
    "so far , this has been realized for coupling two independent homogeneous patches .",
    "the only valid treatment of a complicated gauge theory is by working without restrictions of the gauge throughout the quantization procedure , until the final gauge algebra resulting from the corrected constraints has been confirmed to be consistent . here ,",
    "the anomaly problem , confirming that a consistent deformation is realized , must be faced head - on and can not be evaded . in the final equations one may choose one of the allowed gauges for further analysis , but",
    "gauges can not be used to simplify the quantization . in the rest of this exposition",
    ", we follow these lines to illustrate the consistency of several effective sets of constraints incorporating some of the discreteness effects of loop quantum gravity .",
    "if loop quantum gravity has a chance of being a viable quantum theory of gravity , the form of discrete quantum geometry it implies must give rise to effective dynamical equations satisfying the consistency conditions of a covariant theory .",
    "at the hamiltonian level , this requires a first - class algebra of constraints . after the preparation in the preceding sections",
    ", we can now see what specific models indicate .",
    "consistent deformations implementing the effects of loop quantum gravity have been found in several different cases .",
    "most of them use inverse - triad corrections , which have been incorporated successfully in spherically symmetric models by @xcite as well as linear perturbations around spatially flat friedmann  robertson  walker models by @xcite .",
    "the situation for holonomy corrections is more restrictive ; here , certain versions have been realized in spherically symmetric models by @xcite as well as for linear tensor and vector modes around friedmann ",
    "walker models in @xcite .",
    "however , so far no inhomogeneous model has been found where holonomy corrections in a complete form would be consistent . here",
    ", the requirement of anomaly - freedom appears very restrictive .",
    "inverse - triad corrections have been implemented consistently in several settings , and so are not ruled out by consistency considerations . in particular ,",
    "corrections from the discreteness of quantum geometry are allowed and do not necessarily spoil covariance .",
    "the specific form of their implementation then tells us if and how space - time structures have to change due to quantum effects .",
    "based on formulas such as ( [ invtriad ] ) , inverse - triad corrections arise for any term in the hamiltonian constraint bearing components of the inverse densitized triad , such as @xmath342 .",
    "@xcite have consistently implemented these corrections for linear inhomogeneities , where the corrected constraint algebra is of the form ( [ constralg ] ) but with @xmath343 while @xmath344 retains its classical form .",
    "in addition to the contribution @xmath345 , which is expected classically for a linearization around friedmann  robertson ",
    "walker models with @xmath346 , there is the function @xmath347 ( depending on the background scale factor @xmath44 ) arising from inverse - triad corrections .",
    "an algebra of the same form arises for spherically symmetric models , with different matter couplings as discussed by @xcite .",
    "the constraint algebra is anomaly - free : the system of constraints remains first class .",
    "but it is not exactly the classical algebra , and thus deformed .",
    "inverse - triad corrections from loop quantum gravity can not amount to higher - curvature corrections to the action since this would leave the constraint algebra unchanged .",
    "rather , these corrections can only be understood as deforming local space - time symmetries while keeping covariance realized .",
    "consistent versions for quantum - corrected constraints allow one to analyze their implications for the dynamics .",
    "when constraints are corrected , not just evolution equations change but also the gauge transformations generated by the constraints .",
    "thus , expressions for gauge - invariant observables depend differently on perturbations of the fields , which by itself may give rise to new effects .",
    "other implications then follow from studying the dynamical evolution of gauge - invariant observables .",
    "( some quantum - gravity corrections have been implemented in gauge - fixed versions .",
    "they are formally consistent , but quite arbitrary in their implementation .",
    "for instance , it remains unclear how different gauge - fixings , all done before quantization , might affect the results .",
    "moreover , some physical effects due to corrections to gauge - invariant observables can easily be overlooked . )    for linear perturbation equations around friedmann  robertson  walker models , cosmological perturbation equations are the main application of consistent deformations . with a consistent deformation ,",
    "perturbation equations form a closed set and can be written fully in terms of gauge - invariant variables .",
    "for inverse - triad corrections , as derived by @xcite , they take the form @xmath348 as the corrected time - space part of einstein s equation , @xmath349 as the corrected time - time part , and @xmath350 as the diagonal space - space part .",
    "all corrections @xmath72 , @xmath351 , @xmath352 and @xmath353 below are determined from the basic inverse - triad corrections @xmath347 ( for the gravitational part of the constraint ) and @xmath354 ( for the kinetic term of the matter part ) .",
    "since these are background corrections , their form can easily be computed in isotropic models , suitably parameterized for all ambiguities and lattice refinement .",
    "the off - diagonal space - space part also implies a non - trivial equation , with an unexpected consequence : while the classical analog would simply identify @xmath355 , the corrected equation implies @xmath356 with a quantum correction by @xmath357 .",
    "this may be interpreted as an effective anisotropic stress contribution , but it results from a correction to quantum gravity , not to matter .    as a second implication",
    ", we may have non - conservation of power on large scales as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "this may be important for inflationary structure formation , where the long evolution times while modes are outside the hubble radius would make even a weakly changing size of the overall power significant .",
    "both of these effects are difficult to see in gauge - fixed treatments , such as the longitudinal or uniform gauge , or in frame - fixed versions based on reduced phase space quantizations .",
    "since scalar cosmological perturbations have been consistently formulated only for inverse - triad corrections , no version is yet able to evolve perturbations through a bounce for which holonomy corrections are required . ( implementing holonomy corrections only for the background leads to inconsistent evolution equations for inhomogeneities . )",
    "in addition to inverse - triad corrections , holonomies and quantum back - reaction must be implemented to obtain a full picture from loop quantum gravity .",
    "while consistent deformations are not yet known for the latter two corrections , @xcite have formulated quantum back - reaction in a cosmological setting . in general , in quantum gravity this requires the inclusion of moments between all degrees of freedom of gravity and matter , including quantum correlations between them . by setting the quantum variables of gravity as well as its quantum correlations to zero , one obtains the effective equations of quantum field theory on a curved space - time as a limit .",
    "including leading order corrections from the gravitational quantum variables provides quantum field theory on a quantum space - time .",
    "while such limiting cases can be realized explicitly at the effective level , much still remains to be done for a detailed analysis of specific properties .",
    "several examples illustrate the importance of a consistent constraint algebra , rather than just any deformation as allowed in gauge - fixed or frame - fixed treatments .",
    "we have already seen that some effects in cosmological perturbation equations can be obtained only when neither gauge nor frame are fixed before the theory is quantized or effective constraints are derived .",
    "another example is the realization of causality , as @xcite studied it by comparing the propagation of gravitational waves to that of light .    with quantum - gravity corrections , the gravitational as well as the maxwell hamiltonian change compared to the classical expressions , affecting evolution equations and their plane - wave solutions .",

    ", we derive the dispersion relation @xmath362 for gravitational waves .",
    "since @xmath363 for perturbative corrections , there is a danger of gravitational waves being super - luminal .    with these corrections ,",
    "gravitational waves are faster than light on a classical background . for a meaningful comparison , however",
    ", we should use the speed of gravitational waves in relation to the physical speed of light on the same background , which should receive quantum corrections , too . here",
    ", the hamiltonian is @xmath364 with two correction functions @xmath365 and @xmath366 kinematically independent of the gravitational correction @xmath293 . from the wave equation",
    "@xmath367 we obtain the dispersion relation @xmath368 , which also is `` super - luminal '' compared to the classical speed of light .",
    "working out the requirements for anomaly - freedom with these two contributions to the hamiltonian constraint , as done by @xcite , we find @xmath369 and the dispersion relations are equal . physically , for comparisons of speeds on the same background , there is no super - luminal propagation . in a gauge - fixed or frame - fixed treatment , by comparison",
    ", one could have chosen the correction functions independently of another since tensor modes of the gravitational field and the electric field make up independent physical observables .",
    "a gauge- or frame - fixed treatment could easily produce corrected equations violating causality , but this is ruled out by a complete treatment .",
    "to probe a quantum theory of gravity or even arrive at predictions one must evaluate its dynamics in detail . for low - energy effects , leading corrections to classical equations must be derived .",
    "the best tool for systematic investigations in such cases is that of effective descriptions , providing the evolution of expectation values of observables in a physical state . at the same time , they can tell us much of the entire behavior of physical states .",
    "hamiltonian effective descriptions can be applied directly to canonical quantum gravity and cosmological models .",
    "in particular , typical implications such as the discreteness of spatial or space - time structures can then be probed , or first ensured to be consistent at all .",
    "several examples in loop quantum cosmology have demonstrated that discreteness corrections can indeed be implemented consistently , leaving the theory covariant but deforming its local space - time symmetries .",
    "future work must ensure that this is indeed possible for the full theory of loop quantum gravity and its effective constraints .    while isotropic solvable models of loop quantum cosmology suggest a role of bouncing cosmologies for potential scenarios , no consistent set of equations to evolve inhomogeneities through a bounce has been found .",
    "the only available options so far make use of gauge ( or frame ) fixings before quantization , and thus miss crucial aspects of space - time structures .",
    "any mismatch of growing modes in the collapse and expansion phases can easily be enhanced by cosmic evolution , providing opportunities for potential observations but also requiring extreme care in finding fully consistent equations .",
    "inhomogeneous cosmological scenarios remain uncertain , and with it follow - up issues such as the entropy problem .",
    "what models investigated so far suggest , in many different versions , is that the classical algebra of space - time diffeomorphisms is deformed but not violated .",
    "it is then clear that quantum corrections can not merely amount to higher - curvature terms in an effective action , although such terms may appear , too .",
    "instead , quantum structures of space - time must change by quantum effects .",
    "while space - time covariance is no longer realized in the standard sense , from the hamiltonian perspective the effective theories remain completely consistent and covariant with an underlying first - class algebra of gauge generators . as indicated by the initial quote from @xcite , this sense of covariance , from a general perspective ,",
    "is the appropriate one .",
