    "@xcite analysed duration times for over 40000 flares observed by _",
    "goes _ satellites for years 1976 - 2006 .",
    "the authors found that the histogram of durations can be easily described with the use of lognormal distribution .",
    "with such a distribution it is possible to divide flares into three groups : impulsive - shortest duration , typical - located close to the maximum of the histogram and long duration events ( lde ) - located to the right of the maximum .",
    "such a division is arbitrary .",
    "there is no difference in the physical mechanisms responsible for each group as these flares belong to one distribution with no significant fluctuations .",
    "as at the basis there is no difference between physics of solar flares from the three groups then the investigation of ldes gives better insight into the nature of the energy release process with present instrumentation .",
    "the decrease of brightness of ldes observed in soft x - rays ( sxr ) may last from several hours to more than a day .",
    "much insight into the nature of ldes was made by ultraviolet and x - ray observations , during the _ skylab _ , _ smm _ ( solar maximum mission ) and _ yohkoh _ space missions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one of the most important conclusions is that without the continuous energy input during the whole decay phase the ldes would decay much faster than it is observed .",
    "the whole x - ray emission of ldes is located in loop - top sources ( ltss ) which form before the flare maximum and last for many hours ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "ltss are very promising features for an analysis of the energy release during the decay phase as they should be close to the primary energy release site ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , the presence of ltss during the whole flare decay - phase requires continuous energy release and some restriction mechanism efficiently preventing outflow of mass and energy from them ( see * ? ? ?",
    "observations show that without such mechanism ltss would rapidly lose energy by radiative and conductive processes and should vanish within minutes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hard x - ray ltss were rarely observed for hours after flare maximum .",
    "@xcite observed hxr sources up to @xmath0 minutes after flare maximum .",
    "the sources were large ( @xmath1  arcmin in diameter ) .",
    "two other ldes were investigated by @xcite .",
    "the sources observed grew with time and had diameters @xmath2  arcsec . in one of these flares",
    "the hxr source was visible up to 3 hours after flare maximum .",
    "the analysis of three ldes with the use of _ yohkoh _ data was made recently by koomaski ( 2007a , b ) .",
    "the author reported that hxr sources ( @xmath3  kev ) were observed for about 50 minutes after flare maximum .",
    "the hxr source existing more than 1 hour after flare maximum was also reported by @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the hxr emission was observed close to and above the sxr emission source .",
    "first investigation of long persisting lts based on _ rhessi _ data was made by @xcite .",
    "the hxr emission was observed in the @xmath4  kev range some 4 hours after flare maximum and almost 11 hours in the @xmath5  kev range .",
    "the lts was large and its altitude increased at a speed that gradually declined from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "the higher energy emission ( @xmath4  kev ) was located above the lower energy emission ( @xmath5  kev and @xmath8  kev ) and the whole hxr emission was located above tops of the loops observed in the euv range ( _ trace _  195   ) .",
    "another long persisting lts has been reported recently @xcite .",
    "the authors observed an lts in the energy range @xmath5  kev even 12 hours after the flare maximum .",
    "the source observed was spatially correlated with the fexviii emission observed by ultra violet coronograph spectrometer ( uvcs ) onboard _",
    "soho_.    _ yohkoh_/hxt and _ rhessi _ data have provided useful information about ldes , but only in one channel significant emission was observed .",
    "poor energy resolution of _",
    "yohkoh_/hxt was caused by the instrument characteristics . despite the fact that _ rhessi _ has excellent energy resolution ,",
    "the whole previous analysis was restricted to wide energy intervals which still do not distinguish the actual nature of long persisting lts . here",
    "we present the investigation made with the use of _ rhessi _ images reconstructed in very narrow ( @xmath9  kev ) energy intervals .",
    "_ rhessi _ is very useful for analyzing weak sources even with 1  kev energy resolution due to its high sensitivity .",
    "thus , it gives an opportunity to determine the actual nature of emission of ltss ( thermal , non - thermal ) .",
    "using the images we estimate physical parameters of ltss through imaging spectroscopy .",

    "we investigated set of 9 ldes well observed by _",
    "rhessi_. in table  [ tab2 ] we summarized all obtained observational characteristics . for each parameter ( except characteristic decay time ) we show two values .",
    "the first was obtained shortly after flare maximum and the second was obtained for the last time interval .",
    "such intervals show ranges of values that were observed .",
    "the main conclusions of our work are as follow :    1 .",
    "the sensitivity of the _ rhessi _ detectors allows us to observe the decay phase in hxr emission up to several hours after flare maximum .",
    "2 .   observed loop - top sources are large structures and they usually grow with time .",
    "sometimes we observed decrease of radius after initial growth .",
    "hxr emission sources are located above loops observed in the euv range .",
    "we did not detect any footpoint emission .",
    "obtained values give strong constraints for models of solar flares since high temperatures demand continuous energy release .",
    "the observed non - thermal component is another proof for continuing energy release .",
    "however it must be stressed that observed power - law components have very steep spectra with indices close to the value of 10 .",
