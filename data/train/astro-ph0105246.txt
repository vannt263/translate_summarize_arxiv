    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been used to measure the age , mass density , and dark energy content of the universe ( riess et  al .",
    "1998 , perlmutter et  al .  1999 ) .",
    "this is possible because they make excellent calibrated candles  the shape of their light curves is correlated with their luminosity .",
    "sne ia that slowly decline in brightness ( and have a lower value of the @xmath1 parameter ) are more luminous than sne ia that are fast decliners ( phillips 1993 ) .",
    "there is near - universal agreement that type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are the result of the explosion of accreting co white dwarfs in binary systems ( hoyle & fowler , 1960 ) , though the nature of the accretion process and the type of the secondary star remain unknown . if the age of type ia sne can be identified , then it would limit the mass of the progenitor star and possible progenitor scenarios .",
    "sne ia show variations in properties with environment , as noted by e.g.  filippenko ( 1989 ) , branch & van den bergh ( 1993 ) fisher et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) , hamuy et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and riess et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "many previous authors have attempted to estimate the age of sne ia , including : oemler & tinsley ( 1979 ; @xmath2 yr ) , bartunov et  al .",
    "( 1994 ; @xmath3 ) , mcmillan & ciardullo ( 1996 ; @xmath4 yr ) , and yoshii , tsujimoto , & nomoto ( 1996 ; @xmath5 yr ) .",
    "the above studies assumed a single progenitor population for sne ia .",
    "the only way that the presence of sne ia in e galaxies can be reconciled with intermediate - age progenitors is if they stopped star formation relatively recently . alternatively ,",
    "as suggested by dallaporta ( 1973 ) and della valle & livio ( 1994 ) there may be two channels to sne ia  from both old and young stellar populations .",
    "hamuy et  al .",
    "( 1995 , 1996 ) noticed that the slowest declining sne only occur in spiral galaxies .",
    "however , they stopped short of claiming that the fast declining sne are associated with an older population , since these sne were seen in both e / s0 galaxies and spirals .",
    "hamuy et  al .",
    "2000 also examined the relationship of sn ia luminosity to environment , but came to no strong conclusions about subluminous sne . in this study",
    "we focus on the most subluminous , spectroscopically peculiar sne ia where any age effects should be strongest , then examine other classes of sne ia .",
    "we compiled a list of all peculiar sne ia known at the time of writing .",
    "these sne are listed in table  [ pec - table ] along with their host galaxies and types .",
    "the data were primarily taken from li et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) , branch , fisher , & nugent ( 1993 ) , phillips et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the iau circulars , and the asiago sn catalog ( barbon et  al .",
    "we define sne ia as subluminous if they show spectroscopic signatures of subluminous sne ia such as deep , broad ,  around 4200   combined with enhanced   5800   absorption .",
    "sn 1991bg and sn 1986 g showed both of these signatures , as well as a fast - declining light curve . in the absence of published spectroscopic information , one sn in this study , sn 1996bk ,",
    "was judged to be subluminous due to the fact that it has a light curve decline rate parameter , @xmath6 , greater than that of sn 1986 g ( 1.73 ) . unless otherwise stated , all @xmath1 information in this paper is from phillips et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) .",
    "overluminous sne are defined as sne that are spectroscopically similar to sn 1999aa or sn 1991 t ( see e.g.  li et  al .",
    "2001 ) , or those with a slowly declining light curve ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "these sne show , and is weak or absent .",
    "sn 1999aa shows , whereas sn 1991 t does not .",
    "we note that photometry has not yet been published for sn 1999aa and that it may not turn out to be overluminous .",
    "we still retain this label for these sne which are spectroscopically similar to sn 1991 t . for this study",
    ", most sne were classified based on spectroscopic peculiarity , not photometric light curves .",
    "from the collection of subluminous sne ia , it is apparent that they favor e and s0 galaxies .",
    "ten of the sixteen subluminous sne ia come from either e or s0 ( e / s0 ) host galaxies . to calculate the probability that this is a coincidence",
    ", first we must know the chance that a random sn s host galaxy will be an e or s0 galaxy .",
    "barbon et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) gives host galaxy statistics from the asiago sn catalog .",
    "out of 235 sne ia ( including peculiars ) , with known galaxy types 62 ( 26% ) were from e / s0 galaxies .",
    "we can estimate the probability that at least 10 of 16 randomly drawn sne ia would be from e / s0 galaxies using the binomial distribution ( bernoulli 1713 ) . if @xmath8 is the probability that the host galaxy for a given sn ia is an e or s0 galaxy , and we select @xmath9 random sne ia , then the probability that at least @xmath10 host galaxies will be of type e or s0 is @xmath11 for @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 . thus the probability that it is a coincidence that 10 of the 16 subluminous sne ia are from e or s0 galaxies is 0.2% .",
    "two sne ia can not be identified with certainty as subluminous due to a lack of data , but are suspicious : sn 1980i , and sn 1971i ( branch et  al .",
    "if we include these uncertain events as subluminous sne ia , then 11 of 18 are in e / s0 galaxies and @xmath16 is still 0.2% .",
    "these data indicate that the association of subluminous sne ia with early - type galaxies is real .",
    "furthermore , it is evidence that subluminous sne ia come from an older stellar population .",
    "this is a subtle point that deserves explanation . in the larger sample of sne",
    "ia as a whole , e and s0 galaxies make up only a small fraction ( 26% ) of the hosts .",
    "as long as these hosts are a minority , one may speculate that sne ia come from an intermediate - age population , and sne ia only happen in e or s0 galaxies with recent star formation activity .",
    "however for a subsample of sne ia that greatly favors e or s0 hosts , these sne ia can not be considered an oddity , but must be associated with some intrinsic feature of the host galaxy type . in other words , the property of e and s0 galaxies that makes them unique , an older average stellar population",
    ", must be the culprit ( metallicity is likely a second - order effect , see , e.g.   hflich  et  al .",

    "; ivanov et  al .",
    "2000 ) .    using line strength indicators , trager et  al .",
    "determine the age of ngc 4374 , the host galaxy of the strongly subluminous sn 1991bg , to be approximately @xmath17 gyr .",
    "this age relies on the assumption of a single burst of star formation , and is model dependent , but it seems a safe bet that star formation stopped in ngc 4374 at least 10 gyr ago , giving us a rough lower limit for the age of the progenitor of sn 1991bg .",
    "several previous authors have noted that overluminous sne ia , such as sn 1991 t , tend to favor star forming environments and may be associated with a younger stellar population ( e.g.  hamuy et  al .",
    "these suspicions are upheld in the data presented here .    from the asiago catalog , 42% of sne ia",
    "are from sbc or later host galaxies . in the sample presented here ,",
    "if we consider all events ( even those with uncertainties ) , then 17 of 23 overluminous sne ia are from this late set of hosts .",
    "the binomial distribution gives a 0.2% probability that this is a chance occurrence .",
    "if we throw out the sne ia with uncertainties in their classification or host galaxy type classification , and also remove sne ia in peculiar galaxies , then we are left with 14 overluminous sne ia . of these , 12 are in sbc or later galaxies .",
    "there is only a 0.1% probability that this happened by chance .",
    "while no overluminous sne ia have been discovered in e galaxies , a few have been discovered in s0 galaxies : sne 1998es , 1998ci , and 2000cx . of these galaxies",
    ", the host of sn 1998ci is listed as peculiar , and inspection of ccd images reveals that this galaxy may have a distorted disk . additionally , the host galaxy of sn 1998es , ngc 632 , has evidence for a nuclear starburst and its type is uncertain ( pogge & eskridge 1993 ) .",
    "sn 2000cx has a more normal s0 host , but it is not a typical sn 1991t - like event since it shows a peculiar spectral evolution ( weidong li , private communication ) .",
    "there is an additional piece of evidence that sn 1991t - like objects are found in a young stellar population  the presence of circumstellar material .",
    "five supernovae have been spectroscopically confirmed as true sn 1991t - like events ( not sn 1999aa - like ) : sn 1991 t , sn 1995ac , sn 1995bd , sn 1998ci , and sn 1999j . of these , _ all _ five show signs of reddening .",
    "the sne studied in this paper were culled from a diverse array of sources , so selection effects may not be negligible . to estimate the role of selection effects we also test sne from a more uniform sample .",
    "li et  al .",
    "( 2001b ) present a sample of local sne ia discovered by the beijing astronomical observatory supernova search ( baoss ) and the lick observatory supernova search ( loss ) .",
    "these ccd searches were done using similar techniques and attempt to avoid many of the pitfalls of magnitude limited searches .",
    "this sample of sne should be much less affected by selection effects than a random collection .",
    "it is apparent that subluminous sne ia are preferentially located in e or s0 galaxies in this sample as well .",
    "five of seven subluminous sne ia are in e / so galaxies , giving @xmath18 .",
    "selection effects do not seem to be the culprit in the tendency for subluminous sne ia to favor older stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ drp - fig ] shows sne ia with well - determined , reddening - corrected decline rates .",
    "host galaxy types were taken from the asiago sn catalog .    from this figure",
    ", it appears that the sample can be divided up into three regions , sne ia with @xmath19 ( overluminous ) , those with @xmath20 ( normal ) and those with @xmath21 ( loosely - subluminous ) .",
    "we note that the division at @xmath22 may not be exact .",
    "the line could be drawn at @xmath23 , for example .",
    "we designate sne ia with @xmath21 as loosely - subluminous to differentiate them from spectroscopically peculiar , very subluminous sne ia like sn 1991bg and what may be its weaker cousin sn 1986 g .",
    "we will now call these latter sne ia strictly - subluminous .",
    "we take the dividing line of strictly - subluminous sne ia at the value for sn 1986 g , @xmath24 .",
    "a striking feature about figure  [ drp - fig ] is that strictly - subluminous sne ia are not the only ones that show a preference for e / s0 galaxies .",
    "for sne with @xmath21 ( and spectroscopically confirmed subluminous sne ia ) 18 of 26 in this sample were in e / s0 host galaxies .",
    "the probability that this is a chance occurrence is @xmath25 .",
    "this is interesting because sne ia with @xmath26 are essentially spectroscopically normal .",
    "this indicates that a dramatically different mechanism may not be at work in the normal and loosely - subluminous sne ia .",
    "overluminous sne ia appear to come exclusively from a younger population , while subluminous sne ia come from an old population .",
    "this raises an obvious question : is the age of the progenitor star the parameter that controls the strength of the explosion ? despite the fact that old progenitors appear to be required to produce subluminous sne ia , they also produce fairly normal sne ia .",
    "figure  [ drp - fig ] shows that sne ia in e galaxies have @xmath1 values stretching from 1.13 to 1.93 .",
    "additionaly , the 10 gyr old population of ngc 4374 that was host to sn 1991bg was also the home of sn 1957b .",
    "this sn was subluminous by about 0.9 mag in @xmath27 relative to a typical sn ia ( della valle et  al .",
    "1998 ) , but brighter than sn 1991bg .",
    "it had a decline rate of 1.3 mag .",
    "earlier findings that overluminous sne ia come from a young progenitor population were confirmed , as 17 of 23 are from sbc or later host galaxy types . if we disregard sne with peculiar and uncertain host galaxy types and sne whose classifications are in doubt , then a remarkable 12 or 14 overluminous sne are from sbc or later galaxies .",
    "we also find that spectroscopically subluminous sne ia come from an old population , in the case of sn 1991bg , at least 10 gyr old .",
    "the simplest hypothesis is that all subluminous sne ia are from @xmath28 10 gyr old progenitors , but we can not rule out a spread of ages between @xmath28 5  12 gyr .",
    "more mildly subluminous sne ia ( @xmath29 ) also show a preference for early - type galaxies .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of ivanov et  al .",
    "if the progenitors of subluminous sne ia are @xmath28 10 gyr old , then they should not exist at high redshift . for @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32",
    "km s@xmath33 mpc@xmath33 , at @xmath34 , where the bulk of sne ia in current studies are clustered , the age of the universe is 9.1 gyr .",
    "indeed , no subluminous sne ia are seen at @xmath35 in the studies of riess et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) or perlmutter et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) . due to selection effects , however",
    ", we can not conclude that the lack of subluminous sne ia at high redshift is due to evolution .",
    "the finding that at least some subluminous sne ia must come from very old progenitors places tight constraints on their progenitor systems . only low mass ( @xmath36 1 @xmath37 ) nondegenerate stars will exist in a 10 gyr old stellar population .",
    "it unlikely that the following scenarios could produce sne ia in such an old population : hydrogen ( h ) main sequence ( ms ) stars that undergo roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) or helium ( he ) ms or red giant ( rg ) stars that undergo rlof ( see branch et  al .",
    "1995 and references therein , hereafter b95 ) .",
    "the remaining possible scenarios for subluminous sne are hydrogen rg stars with rlof , h stars that lose mass through a stellar wind ( symbiotic stars ) , sub - chandrasekhar mass explosions , and wd mergers .",
    "sub - chandrasekhar mass models are ruled out because they do not match observations ( hflich et al .",
    "1996 ; nugent et al .",
    "1997 ) . of the remaining scenarios ,",
    "each has problems .",
    "h rg rlof systems are not thought to exist in great numbers ( b95 ) .",
    "symbiotic stars may not exist in significant numbers in such old populations ( b95 ) , may not be accrete enough hydrogen , and should produce interaction with the circumstellar medium with has not been observed ( eck et  al .",
    "neither of the latter two cases should produce a significant number of sne in young populations , meaning that if slow accretion to near the chandrasekhar mass is the mechanism behind a sn ia , then separate channels are required to produce subluminous and overluminous sne ia .",
    "the finding that multiple channels are required to explain the age difference between sne ia is contrary to the suggestion of branch ( 2001 ) that multiple channels are unnecessary .",
    "if there is indeed only a single channel to sne ia , then it must be the double - degenerate ( merging wd ) scenario ( webbink 1984 , iben & tutukov 1984 ) . in this scenario two",
    "co white dwarfs merge to produce a chandrasekhar mass ( or greater ) sn .",
    "one of the most appealing aspects of this theory is that more luminous explosions are naturally expected in younger systems ( tutukov & yungelson 1994 , 1996 ) .",
    "this is because in younger systems more massive stars are evolving to more massive wds than in older systems . for @xmath38",
    "yr , the average total mass of the system is expected to be 2.1 @xmath37 .",
    "sne ia arising from older systems would be less massive .",
    "mergers would also be attractive for producing the asymmetries seen in sn 1999by ( howell et  al .",
    "2001 ) , but some doubts exist as to whether or not they produce sne ia ( e.g.  saio & nomoto 1985 ) .    the author thanks j. craig wheeler , peter hflich , lifan wang , peter nugent , and alex filippenko for helpful comments and discussion , as well as weidong li for providing information prior to publication .",
    "this work was done primarily at the university of texas in partial fulfillment of the requirements of a phd thesis ( howell 2000 ) , supported by grant 9818960 from the national science foundation .",
    "this work was also supported in part by the physics division , e. o. lawrence berkeley national laboratory of the u.s .",
