    "the data obtained through an airmass greater than 2.0 proved to be much noisier than the rest of the data , and ultimately were not used in our analysis . on both nights",
    "the seeing steadily worsened with increasing airmass , from a fwhm of 2.5  pixels to 4.5  pixels ( @xmath36 to @xmath37 ) .",
    "we used standard iraf procedures for overscan correction , trimming , bias subtraction , and flat - field division .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of tres-3 and several nearby stars .",
    "the sum of the fluxes of the comparison stars was taken to be the comparison signal .",
    "the flux timeseries for tres-3 was divided by the comparison signal , and then by a constant chosen to give a unit mean flux outside of the predicted occultation .",
    "we experimented with different choices for the aperture size , and different combinations of the comparison stars , aiming to minimize the standard deviation of the out - of - occultation portion of the tres-3 light curve .",
    "not surprisingly , the best results were obtained when the aperture diameter was about twice as large as the fwhm of the stellar images , and when as many comparison stars as possible were used with mean fluxes ranging from 50150% of the mean flux of tres-3 .",
    "for the flwo data , 10 - 13 stars were used , and for the wise data , 6 - 7 stars were used .",
    "the wise light curve had an abrupt jump at precisely the time when the guiding failed and the pointing changed ; to correct for this , we set the mean out - of - occultation flux to be unity for each of the two segments of data .",

    "this makes it especially important to understand the characteristics of the noise .",
    "the out - of - occultation flwo @xmath3 light curves from 2007  april  26 and 2008  march  12 have standard deviations of @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively",
    ". the expected level of photon - counting ( poisson ) noise is @xmath40 , and the expected level of scintillation noise is @xmath41 , according to eqn .  1 of young  ( 1967 ) .",
    "the quadrature sum of these terms is @xmath42 .",
    "the flwo @xmath4 light curves from 2007  july  14 and 2007  september  14 have standard deviations of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as compared to the expected level of about @xmath45 from poisson and scintillation noise .",
    "thus , most of the observed noise can be accounted for .",
    "the noise in the @xmath3-band light curves , in particular , is only 6 - 7% larger than the noise from these two expected sources .",
    "the out - of - occultation wise data from 2007  august  26 and 2007  october  3 have standard deviations of @xmath46 and @xmath47 . in both cases",
    "the expected level of photon - counting noise is about @xmath48 and the expected level of scintillation noise is about @xmath49 .",
    "thus , the noise in the wise data is about twice as large as one would expect from these two sources .",
    "because of the jump that was observed in each light curve at the time of a large pixel shift , we suspect that at least some ( and perhaps most ) of the excess noise is due to an imperfect flat field . on other nights",
    "when the telescope lost tracking more frequently the noise level was indeed even higher , although those other nights were also characterized by poorer sky conditions , making it impossible to isolate the source of excess noise .    next we tested for any correlations with time or other external variables , and for significant non - gaussianity .",
    "we found no significant correlation ( a correlation coefficient @xmath500.2 ) between the final relative flux data and the airmass , the pixel position , or the measured shape parameters ( fwhm , ellipticity , position angle ) of stellar images .",
    "of course , we had already decorrelated against the airmass , and for the wise data we had already removed the effects of the two pointing glitches , so the lack of correlations with those variables was expected .",
    "for each light curve , we also examined the histogram of flux values , the autocorrelation function , and the factor by which the noise level is reduced when the data are binned .",
    "because the histograms are approximately gaussian , the autocorrelations are generally as small as would be expected for uncorrelated noise , and the noise falls approximately as @xmath51 , in what follows we treat the noise as gaussian and uncorrelated .",
    "one might imagine measuring the planet - to - star flux ratio , @xmath15 , by finding the ratio of the mean flux during the occultation to the mean out - of - occultation flux .",
    "however , because the tres-3 planet is on a nearly - grazing trajectory , the durations of the ingress and egress can not be ignored .",
    "furthermore , the uncertainty in the orbital inclination @xmath3 introduces some uncertainty in the expected shape of the light curve , and the conversion from @xmath15 into the geometric albedo @xmath9 requires knowledge of the ratio @xmath52 and its uncertainty .    to take all of these factors into account , we simultaneously fitted a parameterized model to our @xmath5 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4-band occultation photometry and the high - precision @xmath53 and @xmath4-band transit photometry of odonovan et al .",
    "the model and the fitting method are similar to those we have employed in previous papers in this series ( see , e.g. , winn et al .  2007 ,",
    "holman et al .  2007 ) .",
    "the model posits a circular orbit of a planet with radius @xmath7 and a star with radius @xmath54 , with orbital inclination @xmath3 , orbital separation @xmath8 , and period @xmath55 .",
    "the flux ratio between the full disk of the star and fully - illuminated disk of the planet is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 refers to the bandpass . when the planet is projected in front of the star , or vice versa , we use the analytic formulae of mandel & agol ( 2002 ) to compute the appropriate flux decrement .",
    "we assumed that the flux received from the planet does not vary appreciably over the 5  hr span of our occultation data , i.e. , that the planet s phase function is constant within @xmath58 of opposition .",
    "for the star , we assumed the limb - darkening law to be quadratic , with coefficients ,  @xmath59 for the @xmath4-band data ; and @xmath60 ,  @xmath61 for the @xmath53-band data .",
    "these are based on interpolations for a star with @xmath62  k , @xmath63 , and solar metallicity .",
    "southworth  ( 2008 ) has found that the uncertainties in the transit parameters ( the scaled radii of the star and planet , and the orbital inclination ) are underestimated when the limb - darkening coefficients are fixed at theoretical values",
    ". however , our results for the geometric albedo are not susceptible to this problem , as we confirmed by repeating the fit with a linear limb - darkening law and allowing the coefficients to be free parameters . ] taken from claret  ( 2000 , 2004 ) .",
    "the model parameters were @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath52 , @xmath67 , @xmath3 , @xmath55 , and @xmath68 ( a particular time of midtransit ) , along with the airmass correction parameters for each light curve .",
    "for the transit light curves , we adopted the same flux uncertainties as odonovan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) . for the occultation light curves , based on the investigation of the photometric errors described in the previous section",
    ", we took the standard deviation of the out - of - occultation flux to be the uncertainty in each flux measurement . to determine the best - fitting values of the parameters and their uncertainties",
    ", we used a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) algorithm .",
    "this algorithm creates a random sequence of points in parameter space whose density is an approximation of the _ a posteriori _ probability distribution of the parameter values .",
    "the sequence is generated from an initial point by iterating a `` jump function , '' which in our case was the addition of a gaussian random number to a randomly - chosen parameter .",
    "if the new point has a lower @xmath69 than the previous point , the jump is executed ; if not , the jump is executed with probability @xmath70 .",
    "we used an isotropic prior for the orbital inclination ( uniform in @xmath71 ) , and a gaussian prior in the orbital period to enforce consistency with the value @xmath72  d , which was determined by odonovan et al .",
    "( 2007 ) using the yearlong baseline between the tres survey data and the high - precision light curves .",
    "we used uniform priors for all other parameters .",

    "the most stringent upper limit was obtained in the sloan @xmath3 band , where @xmath82 with 99% confidence . to put this result in perspective , we remind the reader that a perfectly - diffusing sphere has a geometric albedo of @xmath14 .",

    "theoretical reflection spectra for strongly irradiated giant planets such as tres-3 depend upon many factors and are especially sensitive to the presence or absence of clouds . without highly reflective clouds ,",
    "they are generally expected to have very low optical albedos .",
    "the underlying cause of the low albedo in cloud - free models is strong absorption in the pressure - broadened resonance doublet transitions of sodium and potassium ( see , e.g. , seager et al .",

    "condensates may form reflective clouds that can drastically raise the albedo .",
    "the particular condensates that are available will depend on the temperature and pressure profile of the atmosphere .    as a specific example , sudarsky et al .",
    "( 2000 , 2003 ) predicted that gas giants with effective temperatures between about 900  k and 1500  k ( `` class iv '' in their terminology ) have optical albedos @xmath86 in the bandpasses we employed , while for temperatures @xmath87  k ( `` class v '' ) , the albedo is as large as 0.6 .",
    "the difference is that the hotter planets have a high layer of opaque silicate and iron clouds in their upper atmospheres .",
    "the case of tres-3 is borderline , with an effective temperature of 1643  @xmath88  k ( odonovan et al .  2007 ) , where @xmath89 is the bond albedo ( the ratio of reflected to incident bolometric power ) and @xmath90 is a phenomenological factor accounting for atmospheric circulation ( with @xmath91 for isotropic reradiation and @xmath92 for radiation from the dayside only ) .",
    "for tres-3 it would be possible to obtain a self - consistent class  v solution with highly - reflective silicate and iron clouds , e.g. , @xmath91 and @xmath93 , giving @xmath94  k. our upper limit on @xmath95 rules this out , and hence may be regarded as evidence against the presence of highly reflective clouds in the planet s upper atmosphere .    for cloud - free atmospheres , the thermal radiation from the planet",
    "is expected to produce a larger signal than the reflected light ( see , e.g. , lpez - morales & seager 2007 , fortney et al .",
    ". one might wonder whether our limits on the planet - to - star flux ratio also constrain the thermal emission spectrum of the planet .",
    "the thermally emitted flux can be estimated from the effective temperature of the planet .",
    "for tres-3 , even for the hottest possible temperature of 2100  k ( for @xmath92 and @xmath96 ) we estimate that the maximum planet - to - star flux ratio due solely to thermal emission is @xmath97 at a wavelength of 0.9  @xmath29 m . this rough estimate agrees within a factor of 2 with a more detailed atmospheric model of tres-3 by fortney et al .",
    "those investigators classify tres-3 as a pm planet , for which they predict a very low albedo ( because conditions are too hot for any condensates ) and an `` anomalously hot '' brightness temperature ( because of a high - altitude temperature inversion ) . for our observing bandpass the calculated planet - to - star flux ratio is @xmath11@xmath98 . this is smaller than our most constraining upper limit of @xmath99 in the @xmath3-band , and",
    "hence we conclude that the expected level of thermal emission is beneath our detection limit by a factor of 23 .    in summary , through high - precision photometry of an especially favorable target",
    ", we have placed meaningful upper limits on the albedo of a transiting exoplanet .",
    "this is the first time this has been done with ground - based occultation photometry .",
    "our results seem to be limited by random noise , suggesting that the acquisition of more data will lead to increased sensitivity .",
    "for example , with 8 more light curves comparable in quality to the two @xmath3-band light curves presented here , the photon - limited @xmath100 error in the albedo would be approximately 0.03 . even if the albedo proves to be very small , as expected in cloud - free atmospheric models , such a data set would enable a @xmath114@xmath16 detection of the expected level of thermal emission .",
    "of course , it is possible that sources of systematic noise will become limiting factors , such as flat - fielding errors , or time - variable differential extinction beyond a gradual airmass dependence . nevertheless , our results give reason to hope for an unambiguous detection of reflected light or thermal emission from exoplanets based on ground - based photometry using meter - class telescopes .",
