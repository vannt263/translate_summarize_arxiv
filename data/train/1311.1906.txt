    "following the latest combination of mass and signal strengths of the higgs boson by the atlas and cms collaborations of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite , the particle spectrum of the standard model ( sm ) is complete and it reigns supreme as an effective theory for weak scale physics .",
    "however , in spite of its astonishing success , the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , namely @xmath4 , remains an enigma . when compared to the sm estimate @xcite , the latest experimental result @xcite stands as @xmath5 the deviation is above @xmath6 level ( see also  @xcite ) , and it can be resolved if we invoke new physics at a scale @xmath7 gev , which follows from @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a coupling relevant to the new physics . in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) ,",
    "a resolution of this deviation requires light superparticles , namely the smuons and chargino / neutralinos of @xmath10  gev , which propagate in the loop . with @xmath11 ,",
    "the size of @xmath12 can be as large as @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the observed higgs boson mass , @xmath14 gev , demands rather large radiative corrections , which are enhanced by heavy stops weighing @xmath15 tev or substantial left - right mixing @xcite .",
    "gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking ( gmsb ) models @xcite start with an advantage in this context that at the supersymmetry breaking scale itself the squarks / guino are heavier than sleptons / gauginos , i.e. the splitting is in the right direction .",
    "however , in minimal conventional gmsb , which employs a @xmath16 and a @xmath17 of @xmath18 as messengers , the heavy stop pulls up the slepton and weak gaugino soft masses to several hundred gev to a tev which are too high to explain the muon @xmath0 .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) , we proposed a gmsb model that naturally yielded light uncolored and heavy colored superpartners . to accomplish this",
    ", we employed weak su(2 ) triplet and color su(3 ) octet messenger multiplets instead of using the conventional su(5 ) 5-plets . even with these incomplete su(5 ) multiplets , gauge couplings still unify , though at the string scale @xmath19 gev which is somewhat higher than the grand unification theory ( gut ) scale @xmath20 gev .",
    "in addition to satisfying the 125 gev higgs boson mass , we could explain the muon @xmath0 at 2@xmath1 level , with the agreement getting better upon the addition of su(5 ) 5-plet messengers .",
    "in the most favorable region the stau would be the next to lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) being lighter than the bino .",
    "for satisfying the cosmological and accelerators constraints , mild @xmath21-parity violation ( rpv ) had to be invoked which facilitated prompt stau decay .",
    "recently , radiative corrections to the higgs mass have been computed at 3-loop level @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and it has been observed that @xmath14 gev is consistent with stop mass as light as @xmath22 tev even for minimal left - right scalar mixing @xcite .",
    "we show in the present paper that this reduction of the stop mass allows us to present an improved scenario which is more comfortable with experimental data . through the discussion that follows",
    ", we show that a gmsb model with weak su(2 ) triplet , color su(3 ) octet and su(5 ) 5-plet messengers not only satisfies @xmath23 gev , but also can explain the muon @xmath0 at 1@xmath1 level .",
    "gauge coupling unification is indeed nontrivially maintained .",
    "no less importantly , we can satisfy the ( cosmological ) gravitino problem and the lhc constraints without any need of introducing rpv operators ( for an alternative approach , where sparticles of 1st/2nd generation are light and of the 3rd generation are heavy , see @xcite ) .",
    "we employ three types of messenger fields : @xmath24(@xmath25 ) transforming as @xmath16(@xmath26 ) of @xmath27 , weak su(2 ) triplet @xmath28 , and color su(3 ) octet @xmath29 .",

    "@xcite ( for a rough guide , @xmath67 ) .",
    "in order to explain the muon @xmath55 , the bino has to be necessarily light as @xmath10 gev , and the smuon not much heavier .         in fig .",

    "the supersymmetric contributions to the muon @xmath55 has been evaluated by feynhiggs2.9.5 @xcite . to include the threshold corrections to slepton masses from the higgsino and heavy higgs boson @xcite , we have modified the suspect package appropriately .",
    "the contours of different chargino masses have been shown by red solid lines . in the orange ( yellow ) region , the muon @xmath55 is explained at 1@xmath1 ( 2@xmath1 ) level , at the same time keeping consistency with @xmath14 gev . in the region above the blue solid line ,",
    "the neutralino ( dominantly the bino , since @xmath62 is large ) is the nlsp , while in the region below the line , the stau is the nlsp .",
    "when the stau is the nlsp , even though it eventually decays to gravitino , it is stable inside the detector . in this case , the stau mass of less than 340 gev is excluded by the lhc data @xcite .",
    "but we need the stau to weigh in the ( 100 - 250 ) gev ballpark so that the smuon acquires an appropriate mass to explain the muon @xmath55 at ( 1 - 2)@xmath1 level .",
    "hence , viable regions are only above the blue solid line , where the lightest neutralino ( dominantly , the bino ) is the nlsp . because of the @xmath69 induced contributions in eq .",

    "[ table : mass ] , we have presented two sets of reference points , displaying the mass spectra and the prediction for @xmath0 , that pass all constraints . in this context , two types of constraints deserve special mention : + ( @xmath73 )   when the left - right stau mixing term proportional to ( @xmath74 ) is large , the charge breaking global minimum can appear .",
    "the life - time of the electroweak vacuum restricts the size of the @xmath75 , which depends of course on the stau soft mass parameters @xcite .",
    "however , this constraint is not very decisive in our case .",
    "in fact , the lep bound on the stau mass is stronger in the relevant region of the parameter space @xcite .",
    "( @xmath76 )   lhc constraints on electroweak gauginos / sleptons also restrict the relevant parameter space .",
    "searches for three leptons plus missing energy put a constraint on the wino mass  @xcite . in the region",
    "consistent with the muon @xmath55 at @xmath77 level , the left handed sleptons are some what heavier than the wino . in this case , the final state leptons are the taus rather electrons / muons , giving the constraint @xmath78 gev @xcite .",
    "note that in some regions of the parameter space , the wino and the left - handed sleptons are nearly degenerate in mass .",
    "these regions are difficult to be constrained .",
    "besides , separate ( but , not so tight ) constraints exist on the left - handed sleptons , namely , @xmath79 gev @xcite .",

    "reconciling the observed higgs boson mass and the measurement of the muon @xmath0 poses a big challenge to supersymmetric model building . in this paper",
    "we have presented a realistic gmsb model that can address both these issues satisfying all other constraints . from the model - building perspective , the situation has considerably improved since we constructed the scenario of ref .",
    "we summarize below the salient features behind this improvement .",
    "the recent 3-loop radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass imply that the stop squark is perhaps not as heavy as order @xmath81 tev .",
    "a stop mass of mere ( 3 - 5 ) tev can explain the observed 125 gev mass of the higgs boson even for small stop mixing . a lighter stop means a relatively smaller value of @xmath62 ( but still @xmath82 3 tev ) .",
    "this has two implications .",
    "first , the lightest neutralino weighing @xmath82 100 gev is bino dominated because @xmath62 is still quite large ( @xmath82 3 tev ) .",
    "second , the left - right mixing in the slepton sector , which is proportional to @xmath75 , is relatively smaller because the value of @xmath62 has come down from 6 tev to 3 tev thanks to the smaller stop masses . since a smaller left - right mixing implies a smaller splitting between the two slepton mass eigenvalues of the same flavor , for a wide region of the interesting parameter space the lightest neutralino can remain lighter than stau .",
    "note that we could have generated light uncolored and heavy colored superpartners just with @xmath34 and @xmath35 , still nontrivially satisfying gauge coupling unification .",
    "the key area where we really improved with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite , thanks to the presently known three - loop corrections to the higgs boson mass and our assumption of a somewhat _ late _ unification , is that we can now take bino light enough to explain the muon @xmath0 within 1@xmath1 , satisfying at the same time the bbn constraint and lhc data _ without _ introducing rpv operators .",
    "the interesting region of parameter space can be probed at the 14 tev lhc , and precision measurements of the lighter stau can be performed at the future international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
