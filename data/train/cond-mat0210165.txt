    "in confined nematic liquid crystals with a large surface  to  volume ratio the aligning effects of the confining surfaces are of great importance in determining the equilibrium director configuration  @xcite .",
    "there are two major contributions to these surface aligning effects , the first one originating from direct interactions between nematic molecules and the solid substrate ( external anchoring ) , while the second one is due to incomplete anisotropic nematic - nematic interactions in the vicinity of the sample surface ( intrinsic anchoring ) .",
    "an understanding of these confinement related aligning mechanisms is of great importance not only from the fundamental point of view , but also , e.g. , for the design and construction of liquid crystal  based optical devices . within phenomenological approaches anchoring effects",
    "are usually characterized by two parameters : the preferred molecular alignment direction at the sample surface ( the easy axis ) and the free energy coefficient @xmath1 penalizing any deviation from this direction ( the anchoring strength )  @xcite . here",
    "the @xmath1 coefficient depends on @xmath2 , the nematic order parameter .",
    "this dependence seems to be strongly related to the specific properties of a given interface : for example , for a system of hard rods confined between hard walls one finds @xmath3  @xcite , while in experiments measuring anchoring inside polycarbonate membranes even  @xmath4 can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "given , moreover , @xmath5  @xcite ( @xmath6 denoting the frank elastic constant ) , with decreasing @xmath2 the extrapolation length @xmath7  @xcite may either increase ( as seen experimentally in thermotropics  @xcite ) , or decrease ( as obtained from simulations with hard particles  @xcite ) . in the bulk",
    ", the value of @xmath2 is primarily determined by temperature , while close to an interface it may also be affected by incomplete bulk interactions , as well as by ( dis)ordering effects of the ( possibly rough ) confining substrate . in the latter case @xmath1",
    "is often assumed to be simply proportional to @xmath8 , where @xmath9 represents the surface coupling constant , @xmath10 the surface  imposed value of @xmath2 ( determined by substrate roughness ) , and @xmath11 its actual surface value  @xcite .",
    "while both the anchoring strength and the easy axis can be determined experimentally  @xcite , it is also possible to deduce them from simulations based on pairwise intermolecular interactions .",
    "for example , intrinsic anchoring has been analyzed in a pseudomolecular continuum approach with ellipsoidal molecules  @xcite , using a lattice approximation in the zero  temperature limit  @xcite , or analyzing different types of interfaces in gay  berne systems  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , surface anchoring strength has also been measured in a system of hard ellipsoids in contact with a hard wall  @xcite .",
    "the anchoring strength reported in most analyses shows that anchoring is rather strong and that the corresponding extrapolation length is of the order of a few molecular dimensions , while its experimental values are typically above 100  nm  @xcite . on the other hand , a recent analysis of external anchoring",
    " also based on a lattice model , but for nonzero temperature  was presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , showing that the extrapolation length can increase significantly when the nematic  to  isotropic ( ni ) transition is approached , as also seen experimentally  @xcite . moreover , a lattice gas approach has been adapted recently to study nematic interfaces  @xcite .    motivated by these developments ,",
    "in this paper we extend the analyses performed in refs .",
    "@xcite to nonzero temperatures ( employing monte carlo simulations ) and repeat the measurement of the extrapolation length both for external and intrinsic anchoring , the former in presence of rough solid substrates and the latter for a free nematic interface .",
    "the term `` rough '' here refers to flat but partially disordered substrates .",
    "we will first briefly recall the features of the lattice model used in ref .",
    "@xcite , then discuss the modifications needed to perform the present analysis , and finally , present and discuss the results .",
    "we model a liquid crystalline slab of thickness @xmath12 , using a modification of the well  known lebwohl  lasher ( ll ) model  @xcite . in the ll model elongated nematic molecules",
    "are represented by freely - rotating spin - like particles that are attached to lattice points of a cubic lattice .",
    "since the pairwise interaction energy used in the ll model is spatially isotropic and thus does not depend on the relative position of the particles , it can not produce any orienting effects at a free nematic surface and is therefore not suitable for studies of intrinsic anchoring .",
    "therefore , we choose a more general potential to model the interparticle interaction energy resulting from anisotropic van der waals forces .",
    "these forces can give rise to the nematic phase  @xcite even without hard rod repulsion .",
    "for two neighboring nematic particles @xmath13 and @xmath14 with orientations given by unit vectors @xmath15 and @xmath16 , separated by @xmath17 , we model the interaction potential as  @xcite : @xmath18 ^ 2   \\label{1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath19 , which for @xmath20 reduces to the standard ll potential , while for @xmath21 one has the induced dipole - induced dipole interaction .",
    "the spatial anisotropy parameter @xmath22 enables us to continuously vary the relative importance of the spatially anisotropic ( @xmath17-dependent ) contribution to the interaction law  ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "although the range of van der waals potential is proportional to @xmath23 , for computational efficiency we consider only interactions between nearest neighbors .",
    "thereby the intrinsic anchoring energy @xmath1 and the elastic constant @xmath6 are underestimated , but we expect the errors in the estimation of @xmath1 and of the extrapolation length @xmath24 not to exceed 20% and 30% , respectively .    in a nematic slab ,",
    "boundary conditions are typically fixed by the interaction with solid walls , or , alternatively , through orienting effects near free nematic interfaces . in the simulation ,",
    "each of the solid walls is represented by a layer of fixed particles @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) , either all perfectly aligned or somewhat disordered with some residual order .",
    "the nematic ",
    "wall interaction is modeled via @xmath27 ^ 2 ,   \\label{2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as promoted , e.g. , by short  range steric forces , where , again , @xmath25 and @xmath28 are nearest neighbors on the lattice .",
    "a dimensionless anchoring strength parameter can be defined as @xmath29 . in the case of a perfectly aligned surface one has @xmath30 ,",
    "i.e. , all particles are aligned along the easy axis @xmath31 , while for disordered surfaces @xmath31 represents the average orientation of @xmath25 . on the other hand",
    ", a free nematic interface is simply modeled through the missing ",
    "neighbor effect .     and ( b )  @xmath32 cross sections .",
    "the tilt angle @xmath33 is measured with respect to the @xmath34-axis , the sample normal .",
    "boundary conditions at @xmath35 and @xmath36 are homeotropic and planar , respectively.,width=325 ]    instead of the cubic lattice used in the ll model , in present simulations we use a simple hexagonal lattice to model the liquid crystal , which is necessary to avoid unphysical bulk easy axes  @xcite for @xmath37 .",
    "these axes arise as a direct consequence of using a lattice approximation for modeling an anisotropic liquid and are present for any spatially anisotropic potential in the cubic lattice .",
    "they are absent , however , in the hexagonal lattice , provided that the spins @xmath38 are assumed to be two  dimensional vectors confined to hexagonal planes .",
    "the geometry of our sample is shown in fig .",
    "the @xmath34 axis is normal to the confining interfaces and the hexagonal planes are parallel to the @xmath39 plane .",
    "we stress that our analysis must be restricted to low values of the anisotropy parameter @xmath22 in order to avoid solid - like periodic director profile solutions that are stable for @xmath40  @xcite .",
    "the strength of any anchoring can be measured by imposing an elastic distortion so that the average surface molecular orientation deviates from the easy axis defined by the anchoring .",
    "the magnitude of this deviation can then be used to estimate the anchoring strength and the corresponding extrapolation length  @xcite .",
    "the elastic distortion in a nematic slab can be imposed either by applying a magnetic field whose orientation must not coincide with the direction of the easy axis , or by antagonistic anchoring conditions at opposing surfaces . in the zero - temperature analysis of ref .  @xcite the magnetic field method was used . on the other hand , for nonzero temperatures a strong enough magnetic field",
    "can enhance the degree of nematic order and even shift the ni phase transition , which can present additional difficulties in interpreting the results .",
    "therefore , we decided not to use the magnetic field approach ; instead , we consider a hybrid cell - like sample with antagonistic boundary conditions .",
    "consider the @xmath20 case with pure external anchoring first .",
    "the left ( @xmath35 ) interface  where the anchoring will be measured  is chosen to be a solid wall , either perfectly ordered or somewhat disordered , promoting homeotropic alignment through weak external anchoring ( @xmath41 ) . at the same time",
    ", the right ( @xmath36 ) interface is also taken to be a solid wall , yet with perfect planar alignment and strong external anchoring ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "for the case @xmath37 , we replace the solid wall at @xmath35 with a free nematic interface , enabling us to study intrinsic anchoring alone .",
    "note that for @xmath43 the easy axis of the free interface is homeotropic  @xcite , thus providing the same confinement type as with external anchoring . as a result , in both cases a combined bend and",
    "splay elastic deformation is expected to appear in the sample .",
    "the deformation should be present as long as the sample thickness @xmath12 exceeds @xmath44 , where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the extrapolation lengths corresponding to the effective anchoring on the left and the right wall , respectively , while for @xmath47 a uniform director structure is observed  @xcite . in a hybrid cell close to ni transition",
    "a non - bent biaxial structure is also possible , consisting of two strata of uniform alignment , separated by a biaxially ordered layer  @xcite .",
    "recall that unlike in the original ll model in the present study spins @xmath38 are two  dimensional vectors and hence unable to reproduce biaxiality .    for hybrid boundary conditions in the one  constant approximation",
    "the frank elastic theory ( assuming a constant degree of nematic order throughout the slab ) predicts a perfectly linear director tilt angle profile @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is measured , e.g. , with respect to the slab normal @xmath34 . the torque balance condition at , e.g. , the left surface ( @xmath35 ) can be written as @xmath50 and enables us to deduce @xmath45 from the measured values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "note that for small @xmath52 ( i.e. , strong enough anchoring ) the above condition simplifies to @xmath53 and allows us to determine @xmath45 simply by extrapolating the profile @xmath48 graphically across the sample boundary to @xmath54 corresponding to the homeotropic easy axis .",
    "note also that if the degree of nematic order is subject to variations  which is usually the case near sample boundaries in a layer of thickness @xmath55 ( @xmath55 denoting the nematic correlation length )  the profile @xmath48 may deviate from the above predicted linear behavior . in this case",
    "the extrapolation of the profile towards the surface must be performed from far enough in the bulk where the order parameter profile is constant , that is from @xmath56 .",
    "note also that whenever @xmath45 approaches @xmath12 ( for weak anchoring or in a thin sample ) , @xmath51 and , consequently , @xmath45 are accompanied by a significant systematic error .",
    "( external anchoring at @xmath35 ) : director  ( a ) and order parameter  ( b ) profiles for @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 ( diamonds , squares , triangles , and circles , respectively ) ; the bulk ni transition temperature approaches @xmath61.,width=283 ]    our monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are now performed as follows .",
    "the size of the simulation box size was set to @xmath62 for a total of 105984 nematic particles , excluding the boundary particles @xmath25 in the layers at @xmath35 and @xmath36 . in case of disordered substrates particle orientations in the confining layers",
    "are generated following a probability distribution @xmath63 , which gives a homeotropic easy axis ( @xmath54 ) and a @xmath64-dependent degree of order @xmath10 .",
    "for example , @xmath65 corresponds to a distribution close to isotropic , while @xmath66 yields a perfectly aligned substrate .",
    "then , the hexagonal lattice is divided into three sublattices , as shown in fig .",
    "[ sl1 ] , ensuring that the bonds between neighboring particles on the lattice never connect two particles from the same sublattice . considering the simple hexagonal lattice as tripartite enables us to vectorize the simulation algorithm , which provides a significant speed - up in calculations .",
    "further , in the @xmath67 and @xmath68 directions periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "we start either from a random configuration in two dimensions ( recall that @xmath38 are restricted to lie in hexagonal planes ) , or from an equilibrated configuration at a temperature slightly higher than the simulated one , if this is available .",
    "then we apply the standard metropolis algorithm  @xcite . for our vectorized algorithm to work correctly , in each mc cycle we first attempt ( and accept / reject ) trial moves involving particles in the first sublattice and only then proceed to the second one , and after that to the third one . in",
    "generating a new trial configuration each time only a single particle is involved .",
    "we have typically performed @xmath69 mc cycles for equilibration , followed by @xmath69 production cycles to accumulate averages of interest .",
    "we measure the extrapolation length by analyzing the director profile @xmath48 .",
    "the @xmath48 dependence is calculated by accumulating the two independent components of the two  dimensional ordering matrix @xmath70 , where @xmath71 and @xmath72 can be either @xmath67 or @xmath34 , and @xmath73 represents the @xmath71 component of the unit vector @xmath38 .",
    "the average @xmath74 is performed both over all particles in the layer centered at @xmath34 and over the production mc cycles .",
    "then , the averaged ordering matrix is diagonalized and the positive eigenvalue is identified as the two  dimensional scalar order parameter @xmath75 .",
    "accordingly , the corresponding eigenvector is the director .",
    "note that in ref .  @xcite the extrapolation length in the ll model with three ",
    "dimensional spins was studied , using a different method to obtain the director profile . rather than computing the ordering matrix , the polar angle averaged over all particles in a layer and over production mc cycles was computed ;",
    "i.e. , no information was kept about the azimuthal orientation of the particles .",
    "this method overestimates the actual average director tilt angle for small values of this angle .",
    "the strong temperature dependence of the extrapolation length found in ref .",

    "such a model is now similar to the standard ll model , yet it is characterized by a different coordination number ( eight in the former model , six in the latter ) and the dimensionality of nematic spins ( two in the former model , three in the latter ) .",
    "these distinctions lead to a different balance between the decrease of internal energy and loss of orientational entropy upon going from the isotropic into the nematic phase , and thus shift the ni transition to a temperature higher than in the ll model .",

    "in particular , wherever @xmath75 exceeds its bulk value @xmath86 , the nematic becomes more difficult to deform , which results in a reduction in slope ( and vice versa ) .",

    "[ sl3 ] for @xmath79 , a smaller @xmath80 reflects in a reduced anchoring strength at @xmath35 and hence in a reduced slope @xmath85 , which , in turn , results in a larger @xmath0 : for @xmath82 we find @xmath105 , for @xmath83 , @xmath106 , and for @xmath84 , @xmath107 ( for a summary see table  [ tabela ] ) .",
    "note that in the latter case @xmath0 already approaches the sample thickness @xmath12 and is already close to violating the stability condition @xmath108 for the deformed director structure  @xcite .",

    "@xcite @xmath127 was found for @xmath102 at zero temperature .",

    "are typically of the order of 100  nm or greater  @xcite .",

    "@xcite . a small value of @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ 1 ] ) promotes parallel alignment , as is favored , e.g. , by steric repulsions in a system of hard rods . a decrease in @xmath22",

    "in this paper we have studied the anchoring of a nematic liquid crystal to a solid substrate and to a free interface , using numerical simulations of a simple hexagonal lattice model of two  dimensional spins interacting through a spatially anisotropic potential .",
    "we focused on the roles of substrate roughness and of the spatial anisotropy of the interparticle potential .",
    "an elastic deformation was imposed on the simulation cell , allowing us to extract the surface extrapolation length @xmath0 from the director profile .",
    "setting the anisotropy of the potential to zero allowed us to probe the strength of the external anchoring ( the anchoring arising from the direct interaction of the nematic with the surface ) . for temperatures not too close to the nematic ",
    "isotropic transition the extrapolation length was found to be largely temperature independent , and to grow with increasing surface roughness ( as characterized by the distribution of the local preferred axis on the surface ) .",
    "this increase is physically reasonable , reflecting the decrease in the overall anchoring of the nematic as the surface becomes more disordered .",
    "qualitatively similar behavior was found when we simulated the original lebwohl  lasher model where the spins are three  dimensional .    with the full anisotropic interaction potential present",
    ", intrinsic anchoring arises due to the incomplete spin  spin interactions at the sample surface . for a free nematic interface ( and external anchoring absent ) , we extracted the intrinsic surface extrapolation length .",
    "like the extrapolation length in the presence of only external anchoring , this length is temperature  independent .",
    "we found that the strength of the intrinsic anchoring grows together with the elastic softness of the nematic as the interaction potential anisotropy is increased , leading to smaller values of the extrapolation length .",
