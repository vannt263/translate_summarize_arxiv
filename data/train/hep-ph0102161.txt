    "effective field theory ( eft ) is a consistent framework for calculating greens functions below a certain scale @xmath0 when the fundamental theory is unsolvable .",
    "it is based on the principle that a physical amplitude can be calculated from the most general lagrangian formulated with the relevant degrees of freedom and consistent with the symmetries of the fundamental theory .",
    "eft then provides a systematic method of organizing an expansion in @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a generic kinematic variable much smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "this expansion requires a regularization scheme which preserves the power counting in the small kinematic variables .",
    "eft has been applied successfully to the calculation of greens functions that involve strongly interacting particles at low - energies @xcite .",
    "one example is chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) @xcite where only quasi - goldstone bosons of generic mass @xmath4 are present and _ all _ the kinematic variables are small relative to @xmath5gev .",
    "dimensional regularization can be thought of as a _ natural _ regularization scheme for @xmath3pt , because dimensionally regularized loop integrals can only yield terms that involve powers of the small kinematic variables such as @xmath6 .",
    "hence , dimensional regularization is a preferred regularization scheme because it allows the assignment of a chiral power to any feynman graph through a nave dimensional analysis while preserving the symmetries of the problem .    in the presence of heavy particles with generic masses denoted by @xmath7 ,",
    "nave dimensional analysis is no longer valid because the loop integrals also yield terms of the form @xmath8 which spoil power counting @xcite .    for a single heavy particle at low energies , the dependence on @xmath9",
    "can be removed from the propagators by expanding the eft lagrangian in inverse powers of the heavy mass as is done in heavy quark effective field theory and heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "the @xmath10 expansion yields loop integrals that satisfy low - energy power counting .",
    "however , the @xmath10 expansion does not always reproduce the correct low - energy analytic structure .",
    "an example of this is the scalar form - factor of the nucleon where the @xmath10 expansion fails to reproduce the anomalous threshold @xcite .",
    "therefore , the @xmath10 expansion near the anomalous threshold will fail to converge and an infinite number of terms must be re - summed .",
    "this re - summation restores manifest lorentz - invariance .",
    "the retention of manifest lorentz - invariance from the beginning avoids these problems .    a manifestly lorentz - invariant regularization scheme which preserves the low - energy analytic structure without spoiling power counting is desirable . in the presence of a single heavy particle ,",
    "such a regularization scheme called infrared regularization was devised for one - loop feynman graphs by becher and leutwyler  @xcite building on work by ellis and tang  @xcite .",
    "the underlying idea of infrared regularization is the separation of power - counting violating terms from the dimensionally regularized loop integrals , and their absorption into the low - energy constants ( lecs ) of the eft . the power - counting violating terms are proportional to fractional powers of @xmath9 which involve non - integer values of the dimension @xmath11 .",
    "for example , for the nucleon self - energy graph of fig .",
    "[ fig : selfenergyintro ] , the infrared regularization separates out terms of the form @xmath12 .",
    "this separation is achieved by extending the integration domain of the feynman parameters appearing in greens functions .",
    "inspired by this work , a regularization of one - loop graphs with two propagating heavy particles was recently developed in ref .",
    "@xcite and referred to there as eft dimensional regularization ( eftdr ) .    in this paper , a consistent , lorentz - invariant ,",
    "natural regularization scheme is presented which generalizes eftdr to an arbitrary number of heavy and light particles and to higher loops .",
    "this regularization systematically separates out all terms involving fractional powers of @xmath9 implementing a low - energy power counting scheme . to one - loop order",
    ", it is proven that the low - energy analytic structure of the greens functions is left _ intact _ by this procedure such that the regularization is valid throughout the low - energy region .",
    "it is demonstrated in the appendix that this general formalism reproduces the one and two heavy particle sectors as first derived in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in sect .",
    "[ analytic ] , the analytic properties of feynman graphs are reviewed employing the landau equations .",
    "it is shown that the singularities of feynman integrals can be classified according to subgraphs of the original graph . in sect .",
    "[ eftdr ] , the regularization scheme is introduced .",
    "it is shown that the fractional powers of @xmath9 can be associated with subgraphs of the original graph and can be systematically separated out .",
    "to one - loop , simple diagrammatic rules are given to achieve this separation .",
    "the application of the formalism to multi - loop graphs is discussed .",
    "the results are summarized in sect .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "consider a feynman graph @xmath13 with @xmath14 scalar internal lines and @xmath15 loops in @xmath11 space - time dimensions , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the renormalization scale of dimensional regularization .",
    "the momentum @xmath18 of each internal line @xmath19 is a linear combination of the loop momenta @xmath20 and the external momenta @xmath21 .",
    "the feynman graph thus depends on the particle masses @xmath22 and a minimal set of scalar combinations @xmath23 of the external momenta . in a general eft ,",
    "fermion propagators and derivative couplings give rise to a momentum - dependent numerator in eq .  .",
    "since the analytic properties of a feynman graph only depend on the structure of the denominator as will be shown below , momentum dependent numerators can be neglected for the purpose of this paper .",
    "this simplification is not a limitation of the formalism as feynman graphs involving momentum dependent numerators can always be decomposed into a combination of integrals of the form given by eq .  .",
    "the propagators of eq .   can be combined with feynman integrals to yield @xmath24    \\int\\prod\\limits_{\\ell=1}^{l}\\frac{{\\text{d}}^d k_\\ell}{(2\\pi)^d }    \\frac{\\delta(1-\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{i } \\alpha_j ) }    { \\left[\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{i}\\alpha_{i}^{}(q_{i}^{2}-m_{i}^{2 } ) + { \\text{i}}\\epsilon\\right]^i}\\:,\\ ] ] where the @xmath25-functions have been introduced for later convenience . in general , singularities of @xmath26 will arise when the contour of integration gets pinched between two or more poles of the integrand ( pinch singularities ) or between poles of the integrand and endpoints of the integration contour ( endpoint singularities ) . in either case , the integration contour can not be distorted away from the pole of the integrand resulting in a singularity of the integral itself .    a useful tool for investigating analytic properties of feynman graphs is given by the set of landau equations .",
    "they constitute a necessary but not sufficient condition for the occurrence of singularities in @xmath26 and their solution determines the locations of the singularities in the space of masses and external momenta as well as their locations in the space of integration variables @xmath27 . in the representation of the feynman graph ,",
    "the landau equations for @xmath26 are given by @xmath28 where the @xmath27 s must be normalized to satisfy the @xmath29-function constraint , @xmath30 an immediate consequence of eq .",
    "is the vanishing of the denominator in eq .  , @xmath31 eq .",
    "means that an internal particle @xmath19 of the feynman graph @xmath13 is either on - shell or the feynman parameter @xmath32 of line @xmath19 is zero . if @xmath33 , line @xmath19 does not contribute to the remaining landau equations . in this case",
    ", the set of landau equations for @xmath13 is identical to the landau equations for the subgraph @xmath34 of @xmath13 that is obtained by contracting line @xmath19 to a point .",
    "a solution to the landau equations where all the @xmath35 s are non - zero , _",
    "i.e. _ , all internal lines are on - shell , is called the _ leading singularity _ of @xmath13 ; singularities with @xmath36 internal lines off - shell are called _ (",
    "sub)@xmath37-leading singularities_. it follows that every ( sub)@xmath37-leading singularity of a feynman graph @xmath13 can be represented by the leading singularity of a subgraph @xmath34 where the corresponding @xmath36 internal lines of the original graph have been contracted .",
    "the complete set of singularities of a feynman graph @xmath13 is then given by the leading singularities of each of its subgraphs .",
    "for one - loop graphs , a more practical formulation of the landau equations can be derived .",
    "routing all internal momenta @xmath18 to flow around the loop , eq",
    ".   takes on the form @xmath38 where only uncontracted lines @xmath39 contribute . multiplying this equation by @xmath40 for each uncontracted line @xmath19 yields a set of linear equations @xmath41 using the on - shell condition ,",
    "the matrix @xmath42 can be re - written as @xmath43 which is now independent of the loop momentum @xmath44 .",
    "the location of the singularity in the space of masses and external momenta is determined from the condition @xmath45 while the corresponding location in feynman parameter space is obtained by solving the zero - eigenvalue problem and normalizing the @xmath27 s according to eq .  .",
    "a singularity does not arise on the physical sheet when the solution in parameter space lies outside the domain of integration of the feynman graph .       for a feynman graph with two heavy particle lines running through it , figs .",
