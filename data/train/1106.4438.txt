    "a single magnetic impurity embedded into the sea of conduction electrons shows kondo effect .",
    "although this problem has been almost continuously studied during the last 40 years , dynamic and magnetic properties of the kondo and related models still attract great interest in condensed matter physics . much less attention is paid to anomalous _ decrease _ of resistivity with lowering temperature since such decrease can be caused by many different mechanisms . the first attention to this problem",
    "is traced back to the 60 s , when resistivity of dilute fe and cu alloys in rh matrix revealed a new type of anomaly at low temperatures @xcite .",
    "namely , it was observed that resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature in these compounds .",
    "obviously a ferromagnetic exchange interaction of a localized spin and conduction electrons is the first candidate .",
    "in fact , later study on dilute gd and nd impurities in some la alloys such as laal@xmath3 @xcite , and lasn@xmath4 @xcite explained the resistivity anomaly in terms of the ferromagnetic exchange model @xcite , and was referred to as the  reverse kondo effect \" .    in dilute rh alloys",
    ", however , the measured susceptibility indicates antiferromagnetic exchange interaction in these materials in contrast with the behavior of the resistivity . as alternative interpretation",
    ", fischer found that a strong potential scattering can change sign of the kondo logarithmic term in the resistivity @xcite .",
    "the treatment has been much extended and deepened by kondo @xcite , who uses the scattering phase shift @xmath5 of conduction electrons at the fermi surface .",
    "the strength @xmath6 of the potential scattering is related to the phase shift by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the density of states at the fermi surface .",
    "the leading logarithmic term in the electric resistivity changes sign when @xmath9 exceeds @xmath10 , defining a critical value for the potential scattering as @xmath11 .",
    "the range @xmath12 is called reverse kondo range . in this range",
    "the resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature as a consequence of the strong potential scattering .",
    "regarding thermodynamic properties , kondo showed that the effect of ordinary scattering is entirely absorbed into an effective exchange interaction @xmath13 .",
    "correspondingly , the low - temperature energy scale is characterized by temperature @xmath14 associated with the effective exchange interaction @xmath15 .    since ordinary scattering events",
    "are always present in real systems , the kondo problem with strong potential scattering might have relevance also in other compounds that show kondo effect .",
    "for example , the question of relevance of ordinary scattering in uru@xmath16si@xmath16 arises , because : ( i ) recent stm experiments have found that the density of electronic states shows fano lineshape , i.e. antiresonance , in the normal phase,@xcite and ( ii ) in the dilute system u@xmath17th@xmath18ru@xmath16si@xmath16 the resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature.@xcite    in this paper we study the effect of strong potential scattering on physical properties of the kondo impurity . in order to deal with the kondo effect beyond the weak coupling regime , the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) method",

    "the optical theorem is less restrictive than the fsr since the former does not require the fermi liquid ground state .",
    "optical theorem is related to the unitarity of the @xmath133 matrix,@xcite and it follows when the scattering of the conduction electrons from the impurity is totally elastic at the fermi level .",
    "optical theorem was originally formulated for problems of scattering of a single - particle .",
    "when the scattering event happens without energy loss , i.e. it is totally elastic , there is a relation between the square and the imaginary part of the @xmath1-matrix . to express this relation ,",

    "the problem is formulated so far for single - particle scattering , but it is more general and can be applied for many - particle problems as well such as the single - channel kondo model . it is the most easily understood in the limit of @xmath226 , when the magnetic impurity is completely decoupled from the conduction electrons . in this case",
    "the conduction electrons scatter without energy loss , and the optical theorem is held .",
    "although the @xmath1-matrix is complicated and contains many scattering events at low temperatures , strictly in the limit of @xmath227 the optical theorem holds again .",
    "if we express the @xmath1-matrix as @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the phase of the @xmath1-matrix @xmath1 .",
    "equation ( [ eqs6 ] ) gives @xmath230 for the kondo model with energy not only @xmath231 but also @xmath226 .",

    "figure  [ gf - sineal ] shows the obtained inelastic scattering cross section @xmath208 as a function of potential scattering .",
    "note that @xmath208 shows non - monotonous behavior as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "namely , @xmath208 is almost zero for small values of the potential scattering , but becomes non - zero as @xmath93 is increased . with further increase of @xmath93 ,",
    "however , @xmath208 approaches to zero again . since @xmath0 decreases as the potential scattering increases , in the large-@xmath6 range the condition @xmath137 is satisfied at @xmath234 used in the simulation .",

    ", non - trivial physics appears even in the impurity problem .",
    "namely , the resistivity shows anomalous increase with increasing temperature in contrast to the ordinary kondo effect .",
    "this unusual behavior is caused by an antiresonance developing around the fermi energy in the quasi - particle density of states as the value of the potential scattering is increased .",
    "this antiresonance does not influence the universal behavior of the magnetic susceptibility .",
    "however , the sign of the kondo logarithmic term changes in the resistivity when the potential scattering exceeds a critical value , i.e. in the reverse kondo range , which causes the resistivity decrease with decreasing temperature .",
    "we have studied the effect of strong potential scattering on thermal and transport properties of the kondo impurity , and obtained that + ( i ) the magnetic susceptibility follows the universal temperature dependence even with strong potential scattering ; + ( ii ) the resistivity also follows the universal temperature dependence for small values of the potential scattering ; + ( iii ) when the potential scattering exceeds a critical value , the resistivity still shows universal behavior in the fermi - liquid range , but starts to deviate from the universal curve around the kondo temperature , and increases as the temperature is further increased ; ( iv ) the obtained temperature dependence of the resistivity for @xmath150 in the reverse kondo range agrees quantitatively with kondo s theoretical result ; + ( v ) the thermal conductivity also shows universal behavior in the fermi - liquid range , but highly deviates from the universal curve for @xmath150 in the reverse kondo range ; + ( vi ) the asymmetry of the @xmath1-matrix developing with increasing value of the potential scattering is most reflected in the temperature dependence of the thermopower ; + ( vii ) the sign of the thermopower depends on the sign of the potential scattering .",
    "in addition to the study of thermal and transport properties , we have discussed the friedel sum rule and optical theorem as well .",
    "we have shown that the @xmath1-matrix of the kondo model in the presence of potential scattering is not the relevant quantity for the friedel sum rule . instead , the friedel sum rule is satisfied with a proper limit of the @xmath2-electron green s function .",
    "we have demonstrated that optical theorem is less restrictive than the friedel sum rule , because the former holds not only in the fermi - liquid range , but for large energies as well .",
    "finally we mention an interesting question whether the behavior found for strong potential scattering has relevance in real systems .",
    "note that recent stm experiments on uru@xmath3si@xmath3 have found that the density of states shows fano lineshape in the normal phase , and in the dilute system u@xmath17th@xmath18ru@xmath16si@xmath16 the resistivity decreases with decreasing temperature .",
    "since some important aspect of the u ion with non - kramers configuration @xmath238 may not be described by a localized spin with @xmath239 , account of the strong potential scattering in more realistic models is desirable .",
    "we hope that our results in this paper will stimulate further study concerning the fano lineshape and other aspects , which reflect interplay of the kondo effect and potential scattering .",
