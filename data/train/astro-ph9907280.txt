    "mrk 273 ( iras 13428 + 5608 ) is one of the nearest members ( at @xmath3=0.0378 ) of a special class of galaxies  the ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs )  identified by iras ( sanders _ et al . _",
    "1988a , b ) .",
    "it shows a long tidal tail and a disturbed morphology , thus indicating its presumed galaxy - galaxy collision+merger origin .",
    "the merger and its accompanying starburst and/or agn activity leads to the high ir luminosity ( @xmath4 ) through dust absorption and re - emission of the intense but obscured radiation field .",
    "mrk  273 has a sy  2 nuclear spectrum ( lutz , veilleux , & genzel 1999 ) and consequently is a soft x - ray source ( turner _ et al . _  1993",
    "rosat pspc x - ray observations of the field surrounding this galaxy and several other sy  2 galaxies revealed the presence of serendipitous companion x - ray sources around each primary source ( turner _ et al . _  1993 ; see also laurikainen & salo 1995 , radecke 1997 , arp 1997 ) .",
    "the x - ray companion to mrk  273 ( hereafter , mrk  273x ) is 1.3@xmath5 to the northeast ( projected separation @xmath6 57  kpc , at the redshift of mrk  273 ) , with a soft x - ray count rate @xmath750% that of mrk  273 .",
    "( for this paper , we assume @xmath8 = 70 km s@xmath9 mpc@xmath9 and @xmath10 . )    recent spectroscopic observations of mrk  273x have revealed that it is a sy  2 galaxy itself , though at a much higher redshift ( @xmath3=0.458 ) and with some very unusual properties ( xia _ et al . _  1998a , b , 1999 ) .",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) report a soft x - ray luminosity ( @xmath11 erg s@xmath9 ) that is extraordinarily high compared to most sy  2 galaxies even though the photon power law index has a typical sy  2 value ( -1.98 ) .",
    "the radio luminosity ( @xmath12 erg s@xmath9 ) is also quite high for a sy  2 ( yun & hibbard 1999 ) .",
    "furthermore , the derived column density of neutral hydrogen ( from the x - ray spectrum ) is very low for a sy  2 : @xmath13 .",
    "many sy  2 galaxies have @xmath14 ( turner _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) , though values similar to mrk  273x are not uncommon ( turner _ et al . _",
    "high x - ray and radio power along with low @xmath15 are more indicative of an unobscured view of the agn ( i.e. , as in a sy  1 ) , and thus these observations challenge the conventional inclined dusty torus models for agn .",
    "_  ( 1999 ) thereby contrast the possibilities that mrk  273x may be either a sy  2 or a narrow - line sy  1 ( nls1 ) galaxy .",
    "they conclude that various optical emission line ratios and the x - ray spectral index weigh strongly against the nls1 hypothesis and in favor of the sy  2 interpretation .",
    "et al . _  ( 1999 ) additionally discuss the evidence for x - ray variability in mrk  273x , which is still not certain but nevertheless possible .",
    "given the unusual properties of this faint galaxy , we were pleased to find it within the field - of - fiew of our hst image of mrk  273  part of our large hst survey of ulirgs ( borne _ et al . _  1997a , b , 1999a , b , c ) .",
    "we report here on our analysis of the mrk  273x image and of its surrounding field ( which includes many comparably faint galaxies ) .",
    "we describe the hst observations in  2 and the results of our image analysis in  3 .",
    "the latter includes photometric and luminosity function derivations .",
    "we also summarize and discuss in  3 the properties of this galaxy in relation to the properties of analogous active galaxies .",
    "we obtained two sets of hst imaging observations of the primary ulirg target , mrk  273 , as part of our large ulirg snapshot survey program . in each set of observations",
    ", we used the wfpc2 camera to obtain two 400-sec images in the i - band ( f814w filter ) .",
    "pairs of images were used to remove the effects of cosmic - ray radiation events in the ccds ( assuming the events are uncorrelated and have no persistence from one image to the next ) . in one set of observations ,",
    "mrk  273 was centered in the wf3 ccd ( with 0.10@xmath16 per pixel ) , and in a second set , mrk  273 was centered in the pc ccd ( 0.046@xmath16 per pixel ) . in the latter observations",
    ", we found the x - ray companion mrk  273x in the wf4 ccd frame ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gals ] ) .",
    "the standard calibrated data products were re - derived using the best calibration files and then were combined into a single cosmic - ray cleaned 800-sec image .",
    "our analysis was carried out using this final cleaned image .",
    "from their rosat pspc x - ray images , turner _ et al . _  ( 1993 ) give a boresight - corrected j2000 position for mrk  273x at 13@xmath1744@xmath1847.9@xmath19 , + 55@xmath2054@xmath511@xmath16 . using this information and the images in xia _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1998a , 1999 ) , we have identified the optical counterpart in our wfpc2 image .",
    "we find the j2000 position ( within the standard uncertainty of @xmath21 for hst positions ) for mrk  273x to be : 13@xmath1744@xmath1847.46@xmath19 , + 55@xmath2054@xmath511.1@xmath16 .",
    "this is almost exactly the position given by turner _",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 ) .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : gals ] the @xmath22 usable area of the wf4 ccd frame containing mrk  273x .",
    "about 40 fainter galaxies are also seen in this frame .",
    "the darker grey shading of the background light distribution in the lower right quadrant ( southwest ) is real  this is the extended spray of emission from the tidal debris around mrk  273 , as indicated by xia",
    "_ et al . _  ( 1998a , 1999 ) .",
    "mrk  273 is located in the pc frame just below the lower right quadrant of the wf4 frame shown here .",
    "mrk  273x is well resolved , with measurable light out to a radius of @xmath750 pixels ( 5.0@xmath23 25 kpc ) .",
    "it is an essentially featureless galaxy , probably an elliptical or s0 , with a small degree of flattening .",
    "it has a bright nucleus , typical of an elliptical galaxy .",
    "we used various photometric tasks within iraf and stsdas to analyze mrk  273x and its surrounding galaxies .",
    "the ellipse task was used to analyze the surface brightness profile and shape of mrk  273x .",
    "we find that the half - light radius for mrk  273x is 0.40@xmath16 = 2.0 kpc and the radially averaged ellipticity of the galaxy corresponds approximately to an e2 shape , at an average position angle of @xmath7115@xmath24 .",
    "the derived intensity profile is shown in figure  [ fig : devauc ] .",
    "we find that the light follows the expected @xmath25 profile for an elliptical galaxy very well  over a range of 8 magnitudes in surface brightness .",
    "to determine how well the data are matched by the derived ellipse model , we constructed a model galaxy using the derived parameters and subtracted that model from the data to produce a residual map . the different steps in this process",
    "are illustrated in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] , including the original data ( _ upper left _ ) , a 3@xmath263-pixel boxcar - smoothed version of the data ( _ upper right _ ) , the constructed model ( _ lower left _ ) , and the residual ( data minus model ) image ( _ lower right _ ) . from the near - zero residuals , we see that our `` elliptical galaxy '' model matches the data quite well .",
    "according to graham & colless ( 1997 ) , @xmath27 for a wide range of luminosity profile shapes and galaxy models . assuming that this applies to mrk  273x , we find @xmath28 = 1.5 kpc , which is small compared to most ellipticals ( scodeggio , giovanelli , & haynes 1998 ) .    a very small companion galaxy is seen in the optical halo of the galaxy , approximately 16 pixels ( 1.6@xmath23 8  kpc ) east of mrk  273x s center ( see upper panels in fig .  [",
    "fig : mosaic ] ) .",
    "in addition , three brighter companions are seen within 10@xmath16 ( @xmath6 50  kpc ) of mrk  273x , and possibly two additional fainter companions are also seen within that distance ( south - southwest ) of mrk  273x ) , as shown in figure  [ fig : mosaic ] .",
    "note that the brightest of the companion galaxies have asymmetric and disk - like morphologies that are clearly evident at this spatial resolution ( 0.2@xmath16 = 1  kpc ) and low @xmath29 .",
    "such features are not seen at all in mrk  273x , which therefore clearly possesses an ellipsoidal early - type galaxy morphology .",
    "the ellipse model does show significant isophote twisting ( @xmath30pa @xmath31 ) within the central 2@xmath16 ( @xmath710  kpc ) .",
    "this may be induced in mrk  273x through interactions with the close companions .",
    "if the companions have that degree of influence on mrk  273x , then their interaction may also be responsible for tidally triggering the agn activity .",
    "we used the iraf apphot task to measure the i - band magnitude of mrk  273x and of the surrounding galaxies ( see  [ lumfun ] ) .",
    "the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) gives a magnitude of 19.6 ( no passband specified , but probably r - band ) for mrk  273x .",
    "we find @xmath32 ( cousins i ) for the total light . for @xmath33",
    ": @xmath34 and therefore @xmath35 , which corresponds to the rest - wavelength @xmath36-band .",
    "xia _ et al .",
    "_  ( 1998a , 1999 ) report b=20.8 and r=19.6",
    ". therefore , the colors of mrk  273x are : @xmath37=1.2 and @xmath38=1.7 .",
    "we compare these colors in table  [ tab : colors ] with those measured for the galaxies in the @xmath3=0.41 cluster cl  0939 + 472 studied by belloni & roser ( 1996 ) .",
    "the distance of that cluster is similar to that of mrk  273x and so the k - correction can be ignored in the comparison of colors .",
    "we find that the @xmath37 and @xmath38 colors of mrk  273x are consistent with the colors of the late - type i m and scd cluster galaxies , both in the mean value and in the observed ranges of these colors .",
    "based on the color information ( table  [ tab : colors ] ) , we conclude that mrk  273x is either a very late type galaxy ( i.e. , with recent star formation ) or else its colors are seriously affected by the agn ( sy  2 nucleus ) , or both .",
    "on - going star formation in mrk  273x would suggest the presence of gas , which would provide a source of fuel for the agn , and the nearby companions ( fig .  [",
    "fig : mosaic ] ) could provide a possible trigger for the activity .",
    "as we see in figure  [ fig : devauc ] , the surface brightness of the galaxy follows the standard elliptical galaxy radial variation , providing no photometric evidence for an agn point source contaminating the core brightness profile . however , the small measured value for the effective radius ( 1.5 kpc ) may be an effect of the agn contributing some fraction of the light in the core .",
    "mrk  273x has the optical spectral properties of a sy  2 galaxy , but the radio flux , soft x - ray flux , optical morphology , and cluster dominance (  [ lumfun ] ) of a powerful radio galaxy ( prg ) .",
    "we compare and contrast various of these properties with the properties of analogous galaxies in table  [ tab : agn ] .",
    "we see there that the properties of mrk  273x span the range of the different types of active galaxies and yet do not correspond to any one agn type .",
    "its properties are atypical for sy  2 galaxies in that mrk  273x has very high @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 , but very low @xmath15 ( see  [ introd ] ) .",
    "its properties are most similar to ic  5063  only @xmath41 differs significantly between the two sources . we know that ic  5063 has a very high column density ( @xmath43 ) and a high hard x - ray luminosity ( @xmath44 ) , as measured by koyama _",
    "et al . _  ( 1992 ) .",
    "thus the total ( soft@xmath45hard ) x - ray luminosity of the two sources is nearly the same ( as are the optical , radio , and h@xmath46 luminosities ) .",
    "mrk  273x is therefore a galaxy of the ic  5063-type , except that its low @xmath15 allows a high flux of soft x - rays to escape .",
    "et al . _  ( 1993 ) found that ic  5063 shows broad lines in polarized light and thus likely contains an obscured prg or sy  1 nucleus ( morganti _ et al . _",
    "based on these comparisons , we believe that mrk  273x is also a prg .",
    "the brightest of the other galaxies seen in the wf4 frame are fainter than mrk  273x , but they are all comparably bright . we have examined the full wfpc2 image ( including the wf2 and wf3 frames ) and we note that there are a couple of other small groupings of galaxies of similar brightness , number count , and spatial extent . however , those other groupings are relatively far from the wf4 frame ( e.g. , at the far edge of the adjacent wf3 frame and on the far half of the diagonally opposite wf2 frame )  at distances of 75@xmath16 , 110@xmath16 , and 130@xmath16 ( where 100@xmath16 = 490  kpc ) .",
    "even though they are not spatially close to the galaxies seen in wf4 , these other groups could be associated with mrk  273x nevertheless given that all of these galaxies have similar sizes and apparent magnitudes ( i.e. , at a similar redshift ) . to first order ,",
    "given the observed spatial segregation of these groupings , we believe that the galaxies seen in wf4 comprise a small isolated group , of which mrk  273x is the brightest member ( at least , it is the brightest member that we have available within our wf4 image ) .",
    "its rest - wavelength @xmath36 absolute magnitude (  [ photprops ] ) is consistent with this being a bcg ( brightest cluster galaxy ; postman & lauer 1995 ) .",
    "the bcg status is further supported by the @xmath47 magnitude (= 19.6 ) , which makes mrk  273x comparable in brightness to the brightest galaxies ( ellipticals ) in the @xmath3=0.41 cluster cl  0939 + 4713 that was studied with hst by dressler _",
    "_  ( 1994a , b ) .",
    "we used the iraf apphot task to measure a metric @xmath0-band magnitude for the 34 circled galaxies in figure  [ fig : gals ] .",
    "we measured the flux within a radius of 8 pixels ( 0.8@xmath16 = 4 kpc ) and included only those galaxies with @xmath0-band metric magnitude brighter than 24.0 .",
    "( fainter galaxies could not be measured reliably in this short - exposure image . ) within our fixed metric aperture , mrk  273x has @xmath0=19.5 ( compared with @xmath0=19.1 for its total light ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of the marked galaxies in figure  [ fig : gals ] shows that mrk  273x is far ( @xmath7200 kpc ) from the center of the group .",
    "in fact , a bright dumbbell pair of galaxies is seen near the center , but the pair s combined _ total light _ has @xmath0=19.5 .",
    "we show in figure  [ fig : histograms ] the luminosity function for the 34 galaxies in our wf4 frame along with the @xmath0-band luminosity function for two clusters of galaxies at nearly the same redshift : cluster cl  0939 + 472 ( z=0.41 ) from belloni & roser ( 1996 ) , and cluster cl  2158 + 0351 ( z=0.45 ) from molinari _ et al . _  ( 1990 ) .",
    "a comparison of the histograms in figure  [ fig : histograms ] reveals that the luminosity distribution of galaxies in the field surrounding mrk  273x is similar to the bright end of a typical cluster luminosity function at that redshift .",
    "this further supports the notion that mrk  273x is the brightest member of a poor cluster of galaxies at @xmath3=0.458 .",
    "given this galaxy s non - central location within the group , this is probably a dynamically young still - evolving cluster , perhaps still collapsing .",
    "in fact , this group may be on the verge of merging with the other small groups of galaxies seen in our wider wfpc2 field - of - view ( see above ) .",
    "we note that there was no evidence in the x - ray images for an extended cluster - like hot icm within this group .",
    "we have analyzed hst images of mrk  273x , the serendipitously discovered x - ray companion to mrk  273 .",
    "mrk  273x is at a much higher redshift and therefore not physically associated with mrk  273 ( xia _ et al . _  1999 ) .",
    "mrk  273x is a featureless early type galaxy and appears to be the brightest member of a small cluster of galaxies .",
    "the optical morphology of mrk  273x ( including its radial surface brightness profile ) and its role as the dominant member of a cluster resemble the properties of a prg : an elliptical or other early type galaxy . however , its colors and sy  2 spectrum are typical of much later galaxy types .",
    "this suggests that the galaxy s colors are strongly contaminated by the agn ( through both its blue continuum and its emission lines ) .",
    "we believe that mrk  273x is an active galaxy of the ic  5063 type , except that the soft x - ray source in mrk  273x is not obscured as it is in ic  5063 .",
    "mrk  273x therefore appears to be a selectively obscured prg in that the radio core and x - ray emitting region are exposed ( as in a typical prg or sy  1 ) , but the broad line - emitting region is obscured ( as in a typical sy  2 ) .",
    "this may indicate that the obscuring torus has an intermediate line - of - sight inclination .",
    "followup observations ( particularly , redshift determinations ) of the galaxies surrounding mrk  273x would validate the cluster hypothesis and thus shed some light on the dynamical state of this system and possibly lead to an identification of the trigger ( tidal companion ) for the agn activity .",
