    "the explosion mechanism of core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) is still unresolved despite persistent efforts by many researchers over several decades .",

    "meanwhile , effects of magnetic field on the explosion dynamics has been studied well for the decade .",

    "the magnetic fields assumed in these simulations are so strong that the conservation of magnetic flux during collapse results in the field strength of @xmath3  g for the proto - neutron star surface .",
    "this is comparable to inferred surface magnetic fields of magnetar candidates ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for review of magnetars ) .",
    "at present , however , the strength of the magnetic field at the pre - collapse stage and the origin of strong magnetic field of magnetar are very uncertain .",
    "stellar evolution simulations by @xcite , which implement tayler  spruit dynamo model , show that the pre - collapse strength of the poloidal magnetic field in 15  @xmath4 star is only @xmath5  g. meanwhile , recent observations report that some ob stars in the main sequence stage possess an @xmath6  kg surface magnetic field ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which corresponds to magnetar - class magnetic flux .",
    "@xcite carried out a population synthesis calculation from main sequence stars to neutron stars , assuming the magnetic flux is conserved in the post - main - sequence evolution ( fossil field hypothesis ) .",
    "their result implies that @xmath7% of ob stars have magnetar - class magnetic flux , while the majority have @xmath812 orders of magnitude weaker one .",
    "even when the pre - collapse magnetic flux is weak , corresponding to the magnetic field of @xmath9  g for the proto - neutron star surface , mhd instabilities may amplify it to magnetar - class strength .",
    "so far , there have been a small number of works focusing on this issue .",
    "@xcite argued that convective dynamo in proto - neutron stars generates a magnetar - class magnetic field .",
    "simulations performed by @xcite shows that standing accretion shock instability amplifies the magnetic field around the proto - neutron star surface from @xmath10  g to @xmath11  g. for rapidly rotating progenitors , magnetorotational instability ( mri , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) may greatly amplify the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "local box simulations characterizing a post - bounce core show that an initially weak magnetic field , @xmath10@xmath2  g inside the proto - neutron star , exponentially grows due to mri @xcite .",
    "km , compared to the iron core , the global gradients of physical quantities are taken into account , by which they refer these simulations semi - global . ]    in simulations of mri from a sub - magnetar - class seed magnetic field , @xmath9  g , a quite fine grid size compared to the scale of the iron core , e.g. , @xmath12  km , is required : the wavelength of maximum growing mode around the surface of the proto - neutron star is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is alfvn velocity . in order to attain such a high resolution , local simulations are adopted in previous works @xcite .",
    "however , in local simulations , it is problematic to prepare a suitable background state : although an initially stationary background is usually used in local simulations , post - bounce cores are dynamical",
    ". additionally , local simulations are incapable of studying the global dynamics . to relieve these problems , global simulations are desirable .    in this letter , we report the first global simulations of mri in ccsne from a seed magnetic field of sub - magnetar - class flux . to ease high computational cost",
    "demanded in global simulations , we carried out computations in axisymmetry and in limited radial range , 50500  km .",
    "particular attention is paid to , ( i ) whether mri amplify the magnetic field to magnetar - class strength even in the dynamical background of ccsne , and ( ii ) whether the amplified magnetic field is strong enough to affect the dynamics .",
    "in the simulations , we solve the following ideal mhd equations , employing a time - explicit eulerian mhd code , _ yamazakura _ @xcite : @xmath15 = -\\rho(\\nabla\\phi)\\cdot\\mbox{\\boldmath$v$}\\label{eq.mhd.eng } , \\\\ & & \\frac{\\partial\\mbox{\\boldmath $ b$}}{\\partial t}= \\nabla\\times\\left(\\mbox{\\boldmath$v$}\\times\\mbox{\\boldmath$b$}\\right ) \\label{eq.mhd.far},\\end{aligned}\\]]in which notations of the physical variables follow custom . here , @xmath16 is newtonian mono - pole gravitational potential .",
    "computations are done with polar coordinates in two dimension , assuming axisymmetry and equatorial symmetry .",
    "we adopt a tabulated nuclear equation of state produced by @xcite .",
    "neutrinos are not dealt with in our simulations .",
    "the electron fraction , which is required to obtain the pressure of a fluid element from the eos table , is given by a prescription suggested by @xcite .",
    "we should note that the liebendrfer s prescription is only valid until bounce .",
    "@xcite discussed that adopting this prescription in the post - bounce phase may lead to underestimation of pressure by upto 20% .    before simulating mri",
    ", we first follow the collapse of a 15  @xmath4 progenitor star ( s. e. woosley 1995 , private communication ) for the central region of 4000  km radius , until @xmath17  ms after bounce ( basic run ) .",
    "after the central density reaches @xmath1  g  @xmath18 , the core is covered with @xmath19 numerical grids , where the spatial resolution is 0.423  km .",
    "the core is assumed to be rapidly rotating with the initial angular velocity profile of @xmath20 where @xmath21  km and @xmath22  rad s@xmath23 , corresponding to a millisecond proto - neutron star after collapse .",
    "the same dipole - like magnetic field configuration as one employed by @xcite is initially assumed with the typical field strength of @xmath24  g around the pole inside a radius of 1000  km , with which the strength of @xmath25  g is obtained for the proto - neutron star surface",
    ". the initial rotational energy and magnetic energy divided by the gravitational binding energy are @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .    to conduct high resolution global simulations to capture the growth of mri in the core , we restrict the numerical domain to a radial range of @xmath28km@xmath29 ( mri run ) .",
    "the initial condition of mri run is set by mapping the data of basic run onto the above domain , at 5  ms after bounce . at that time , the density at the inner - most grids is @xmath30@xmath31 g  @xmath18 .",
    "the inner and outer radial boundary conditions for mri run are given by the data of basic run , except for @xmath32 .",
    "the boundary values of @xmath32 are given so that the divergence free condition of the magnetic field is satisfied .",
    "the grid spacing is such that the radial and angular grid sizes are same , viz .",
    "@xmath33 , at the inner and outer most cells .",
    "we perform mri runs with four different grid resolutions , where the grid sizes of the inner most cells , @xmath34 , ( and the numbers of grids , @xmath35 , ) are 12.5  m ( @xmath36 ) , 25  m ( @xmath37 ) , 50  m ( @xmath38 ) , and 100  m ( @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that with above parameters , typical mri growth wavelength around the inner boundary is several 100  m at the beginning of mri runs .",
    "we stop each mri run , before the shock surface reaches the outer boundary .",
    "in each mri run , we found a clear exponential growth of the poloidal magnetic energy during @xmath4018  ms , where @xmath41  ms corresponds to the beginning of mri run ( see left panel of figure  [ t - b ] ) . the growth timescale is larger for higher grid resolution , but almost converges to @xmath42",
    "ms at mri run with @xmath43  m. afterward , the poloidal magnetic energy gradually increases , and roughly saturates around @xmath44  ms , in which the saturation energy is larger for higher grid resolution",
    ". the evolution of toroidal magnetic energy does not show clear exponential growth in each mri run .",
    "although the growth rate is initially larger compared with that of the poloidal magnetic energy , it becomes smaller after the exponential growth of the poloidal magnetic energy sets in . at saturation , in mri run with @xmath45  m ,",
    "the poloidal magnetic energy is twice as large as the toroidal magnetic energy .",
    "we also follow the variation of the poloidal magnetic field structure , for mri run with @xmath45  m. around @xmath40  ms , when the exponential growth begins , magnetic field lines around the pole in the vicinity of the inner boundary start to bend . during the exponential growth phase ,",
    "the magnetic field lines in this region are further stretched , and filaments of strong magnetic field , @xmath11  g , appear ( see panel ( a ) of figure  [ multi2d ] for @xmath46  ms ) .",
    "after the exponential growth ceases , the topology of magnetic field lines becomes rather tangled , which implies that the flow becomes turbulent ( see panel ( b ) for @xmath47  ms ) .",
    "subsequently , filaments of strong magnetic field and the turbulent flow pattern , which first appear around the pole , also emerge in other regions .",
    "this phase corresponds to the duration of the gradual increase of the poloidal magnetic energy , @xmath4850  ms , observed in figure  [ t - b ] .",
    "after the poloidal magnetic energy saturates ( @xmath44  ms ) , a considerable fraction inside a radius of 150  km is dominated by turbulent flow , where the strength of the magnetic field reaches @xmath11@xmath49  g in filamentous flux tubes ( see panel ( c ) for @xmath50  ms ) .    the bent magnetic field lines , the exponential growth of the poloidal magnetic field , the fact the growth rate is larger for higher gird resolution , and the turbulence after the exponential growth , all invoke the occurrence of mri in our simulations .",
    "as seen in panel ( e ) of figure  [ multi2d ] , the number of grids covering the maximum growing wavelength in mri run with @xmath45  m is more than 20 in most areas , although it is less than five in some limited locations in the vicinity of the pole and equator .",
    "thus , our highest - resolution mri run seems almost capable to fairly capture the linear growth of mri . according to @xcite , the growth timescale obtained by the linear theory is @xmath51 where @xmath52 in panel ( f ) of figure  [ multi2d ] , the distribution of @xmath53 for mri run with @xmath54  m at 4  ms is depicted .",
    "it is found that , except for the very vicinity of the pole , where the grid resolution is not enough , the growth timescale is shortest , @xmath5510  ms , around the pole in the vicinity of the inner boundary .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that magnetic field amplification first occurs there .",
    "additionally , the numerically estimated growth timescale , @xmath42  ms ( figure  [ t - b ] ) , approximately coincides with the above theoretical value .",
    "we also estimated @xmath53 without the effect of the gradient of entropy and the lepton fraction , by setting @xmath56 in equation  ( [ tmri ] ) , but found insignificant difference from the original one , which indicates that convection does not much contribute to amplify the magnetic field .",
    "with all the above facts , we conclude that amplification of poloidal magnetic field found in our simulations is mainly due to mri .",
    "since axisymmetry is assumed in our simulations , the toroidal component of the magnetic field is not directly amplified by mri .",
    "the growth of the toroidal magnetic energy , which is slower than that of the poloidal magnetic energy , seems due to winding of magnetic field lines by differential rotation .    in local simulations performed by @xcite ,",
    "the pattern of coherent channel flows appears during the exponential growth phase . in our simulations , on the other hand , such a pattern is never observed .",
    "although chanel - like configurations are locally observed in the exponential growth phase ( see panel ( d ) of figure  [ multi2d ] ) , they are incoherent , and soon disrupted in timescale of milliseconds .",
    "such immediate disruption of channel flows seems to be caused by dynamical flow motions in the background , which is difficult to be taken into account in local simulations .    in left panel of figure  [ spect ] ,",
    "the energy spectra of the poloidal magnetic energy are plotted for mri run with @xmath45  m at different evolutionary phases .",
    "each spectrum is derived for radial wave numbers , @xmath57 , and for a region @xmath58 and @xmath59 . at @xmath60",
    "ms , the spectrum shows the dominance of a large scale , @xmath61  km , just reflecting the structure of the background magnetic field . during the linear growth phase , @xmath4018  ms , smaller scale structures , @xmath62  km , grow fast compared with the larger ones .",
    "consistently , we found that the maximum growing wavelength of mri around the pole is generally @xmath6310  km during this phase . at the end of the simulation ( saturation phase ) , the spectrum shows almost flat distribution for @xmath64  km , and steep decay for @xmath651  km . in the range between them ,",
    "a slope close to @xmath66 is observed , which seems to correspond to the inertial region of kologomorov s theory .",
    "such spectrum affirms that the flow is turbulent .",
    "also , it indicates that large scale components of the magnetic field , comparable to the size of the proto - neutron star , are produced in our simulations .",
    "since the maximum growing wavelength of mri is generally smaller than this scale , as mentioned above , the large scale components are likely to be a result of inverse cascade .",
    "we also compare the average spectra of the poloidal magnetic energy for @xmath6770  ms among mri runs ( right panel of fig  [ spect ] ) .",
    "it is found that in a lower resolution run , the spectrum tends to turn the steep decay at larger scale , which seems to be due to a larger numerical diffusion .",
    "it is likely that this causes smaller spectral energy for a low resolution run over whole scales , and smaller saturation level observed in figure  [ t - b ] .",
    "figure  [ ibeta ] shows that magnetic pressure reaches @xmath68% of matter pressure in some locations , which implies that the magnetic field mildly affects the dynamics .",
    "note , however , that we did not obtain the convergence of the saturation magnetic field , and a larger saturation level is attained for a higher resolution run ( figure  [ t - b ] ) .",
    "this suggest that the simulation with a high - enough resolution might result in a larger impact of the magnetic field on the dynamics .",
    "we have carried out the first global simulations of mri in ccsne from a sub - magnetar - class seed magnetic field , @xmath25  g around the surface of the proto - neutron star , and rapid rotation , in which two - dimensional ideal mhd equations are solved with assumptions of axisymmetry and equatorial symmetry . as a result of computations , we found that mri greatly amplifies the magnetic field to magnetar - class strength , @xmath69@xmath49  g , and that the magnetic field at saturation phase is dominated by large scale structure .",
    "although , the impact of the magnetic field on the dynamics found to be mild , we do not obtain the convergence of the saturation magnetic field strength , which is larger for a higher resolution run .",
    "a simulation with a higher resolution is necessary to assess the actual impact .",
    "we also found that the evolution of flow pattern in our global simulations are quite different from those appear in local simulations by @xcite .    since mri and turbulence are intrinsically non - axisymmetric phenomena , three - dimensional simulations are , in fact , necessary to lead to conclusive results .",
    "note , however , that even the world s best computers may only capable to simulate global mri from a magnetar - class seed magnetic field in three dimension .",
    "@xcite found that the main difference between two - dimensional and three dimensional simulations is that the former results in a larger saturation magnetic field compared with the latter .",
    "they argued that the smaller saturation level in three dimension is caused by the disruption of coherent chanel flows before they grow well due to non - axisymmetric parasitic instabilities .",
    "such difference might not appear in global simulations , since our simulations show that coherent chanel flows do not develop even in two dimension .",
    "while the present simulations set the position of the inner boundary at @xmath70  km , we found in basic run that most rotational energy is reserved inside a radius of 50  km .",
    "it is expected that a simulation with the inner boundary located at a smaller radius would result in a larger saturation magnetic field .",
    "what we obtained in this study may be a lower limit .",
    "although , in our simulations , a sub - magnetar - class magnetic field is amplified to magnetar - class strength due to mri , we should be cautious in concluding that mri can be the origin of magnetar fields . before that , further investigations may be required on the sustainability of a large scale , strong magnetic field until , e.g. , the formation of the neutron star .",
    "additionally , it is worth investigating whether magnetar - class strength is also attained by mri from a weaker seed magnetic field , e.g. , @xmath71  g around the proto - neutron star surface .",
    "note that previous local simulations of mri , including ones in the context of accretion disks , show that a weaker seed magnetic field results in a lower saturation level ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dependence of the saturation magnetic field on the rotational velocity , which also has been discussed in many local simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is another issue to be studied in future works .",
