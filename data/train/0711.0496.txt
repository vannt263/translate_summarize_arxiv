    "the properties of quark matter at extreme conditions have been an active research area both theoretically and experimentally . at high temperature , the quark - gluon plasma(qgp )",
    "has long been searched by colliding two nuclei at sufficiently high energy . on the other side",
    ", we expect that quark matter becomes color superconducting through a phase transition at high baryon density but low temperature@xcite , which is the typical condition inside compact stars .    in a typical metallic superconductor , the electrons pair with equal chemical potential near the fermi surface .",
    "the situation with a quark matter , however , is much more complicated . while the quark - quark interaction favors pairing between quarks of different flavors , the mass difference among @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 together with the charge neutrality requirement induces a substantial mismatch among their fermi momenta at the baryon density inside a compact star and thereby reduces the available phase space for cooper pairing .",
    "a number of exotic color superconductivity phases in the presence of mismatch have been proposed in the literature@xcite , but a consensus point of view of the true ground state has not been reached .",
    "the single flavor pairing@xcite , which is free from the fermi momentum mismatch , is an interesting alternative in this circumstance and will be considered here .",
    "since the quark - quark interaction is attractive in the color anti - triplet channel , the color wave function of the pair is anti - symmetric . for the equal helicity pairing to be considered in this article",
    ", the parity of the orbital wave function has to be odd as required by the pauli principle . except for the color - spin - lock phase examined in @xcite ,",
    "the energy gap will not be spherical .",
    "the odd parity prevents the diquark wave function from realizing the full pairing potential .",
    "the energy scale of the color superconductivity is therefore reduced",
    ".    at ultra - high baryon densities , asymptotic freedom of qcd ensures the validity of the weak coupling expansion , which has been carried out for csc by a number of authors@xcite .",
    "the dominant pairing interaction is mediated by one - gluon exchange and can be decomposed into partial waves , as is shown in eq.([33 ] ) below .",
    "quantitative results of the transition temperature in the equal helicity channel with an arbitrary angular momentum has been obtained from the first principle @xcite , and read @xmath4 \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the number of flavor , @xmath6 is the number of colors , @xmath7 is the chemical potential , @xmath8 is the running coupling constant of qcd and @xmath9 is the euler constant .",
    "the @xmath10-dependent constant @xmath11 the equal helicity pairing of odd parity picks up @xmath12 as the transition temperature .",
    "we have @xmath13 .",
    "natural analogy is drawn with the superfluidity of @xmath14 .",
    "but important difference between the pairing potential in quark matter and that in @xmath14 has to be considered before ascertaining the angular dependence of the energy gap .",
    "the forward singularity of the one - gluon exchange renders the pairing strength _",
    "equal _ for _ all _ partial waves ( the same leading order term inside the bracket of ( [ 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the paring potential in @xmath14 , however , is entirely in the channel of @xmath15 .",
    "the transition temperature was determined from the pairing instability of the diquark scattering amplitude in the normal phase . in a perturbative treatment ,",
    "the dyson - schwinger equation for the scattering amplitude is linear and the partial wave decomposition in eq.([1 ] ) is legitimate .",
    "this is not the case with the gap equation below @xmath16 , which is nonlinear . a non - spherical solution of the gap equation , in general , will be a mixture of different partial waves unless the the pairing is dominated in one angular momentum channel .",
    "the adjective `` non - spherical '' refers to the magnitude of the energy gap of the quasi - particle .",
    "so the @xmath3-wave and the csl gaps are spherical and are therefore free from the angular momentum mixing .",
    "the gap equations in these cases are linear with respect to the angular dependence .",
    "a nonspherical gap function , @xmath17 , for the equal helicity pairing at @xmath18 contains all spherical harmonics of odd parity with the same azimuthal quantum number @xmath19 .",
    "we have @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gap function of 2sc in the absence of the mismatch , @xmath22 the direction of the relative momentum of the two quarks in a cooper pair and the angular dependent factor @xmath23 with @xmath10 the _ total _ angular momentum of the cooper pair .",
    "carrying the formulation of @xmath14 over to qcd amounts to drop all higher multipoles except that of @xmath15 , which will not satisfy the gap equation of qcd .",
    "it was argued in the literature that @xmath24 but @xmath25 for @xmath26 , this , as will be shown below , is not the case .",
    "instead , we find that the function @xmath27 satisfies a nontrivial integral equation and thus @xmath28 for all odd @xmath10 s",
    ". therefore the angular momentum mixing does occurs in the subleading order of the gap function .",
    "the angular momentum mixing will modify all non - spherical `` spin-1 '' csc examined in the literature , we shall focus our attention in this paper to the equal helicity pairing with zero azimuthal quantum number , i.e. the analog of the polar phase of @xmath14 .",
    "the subscript @xmath19 of @xmath17 and @xmath29 will be suppressed below . even though this phase is unstable , it is the simplest one to illustrate the mixing mechanism .",
    "the current work is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we shall clarify the concept of the angular momentum mixing with a toy model of non - relativistic and spinless fermions . in the sect .",
    "iii the gap equation for the single flavor csc will be derived by minimizing the cjt free energy of qcd .",
    "this gap equation will be reduced to an nonlinear integral equation for the function @xmath30 in the subsequent section and the numerical solution will be presented in the sect , v. we conclude the paper in the sect .",
    "some technical details are deferred to the appendices .",
    "our units are @xmath31 and 4-vectors are denoted by capital letters , @xmath32 with @xmath33 the matsubara energy , which becomes continuous at @xmath34 . throughout the article , we shall follow the definition of the leading order and the subleading order in @xcite . upon taking the logarithm of the transition temperature or the magnitude of the gap function",

    "since the gap function contains only the partial wave of @xmath15 , there is no angular momentum mixing .",

    "@xmath83 the condensation energy density in this case reads @xmath84 we refer to this case as the case with the angular momentum mixing because the gap function ( [ toymixing ] ) contains all partial waves .",
    "carrying the solution of the case i to the case ii amounts to drop all partial waves other than that of @xmath15 and would lead to a lower magnitude of the condensation energy ( [ condi ] ) .",
    "the case with qcd is similar to the case ii above since the forward singularity of the diquark scattering renders the pairing strength of all partial waves equal to the leading order .",
    "the running coupling constant @xmath8 of qcd corresponds to @xmath85 here and the angular momentum mixing shows up in the @xmath36 term of @xmath86 .",
    "therefore we expect angular momentum mixing to the subleading order of the angular dependence of the gap function .",
    "besides being an ultra relativistic system , the csc of qcd differs from the toy model considered above in two aspects .",
    "the forward singularity of qcd also brings about the energy dependence of the gap , so the gap equation ( [ gapeq ] ) will be replaced by the eliashberg equation derived by minimizing the cjt effective action of qcd .",
    "secondly , the pairing strength of each partial wave does fall off with an increasing @xmath10 in the sub - leading order of the pairing potential .",

    "there are many other candidate pairing states between quarks of the same flavor @xcite . among them",

    "there may be phenomenological implications of the angular momentum mixing . a systematic survey of the angular momentum mixing effect in all `` spin-1 '' csc states covered in @xcite will be reported in another paper .",
    "another place where the angular momentum mixing shows up is the csc - loff state in the presence of fermi momentum mismatch .",
    "it has been speculated @xcite that the forward singularity will increase the upper limit of the mismatch value that supports a loff pairing .",
    "the new threshold was found in @xcite , motivated by the nearly equal pairing strength of all partial wave channels .",
