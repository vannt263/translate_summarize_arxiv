    "quantum coherence and its destruction by coupling to a dissipative environment play an important role in the transport phenomena of a particle moving in a potential @xcite .",
    "well known examples include electron transfer in molecular and biological systems @xcite , many chemical reactions @xcite , squid rings @xcite , quantum ratchets @xcite , nonlinear optical processes @xcite , and tunneling processes in device systems @xcite .",
    "such systems are commonly modeled as one - dimensional or two - dimensional potential systems coupled to heat bath degrees of freedom , which drive the systems toward the thermal equilibrium state .",
    "the heat bath degrees of freedom are then reduced using such methods as the projection operator method or the path integral method , for example .",
    "many equations of motion have been derived for the purpose of understanding the quantum aspects of dissipative dynamics @xcite .",
    "because a complete picture of quantum dissipative dynamics must treat phenomena that can only be described in real time , a great deal of effort has been dedicated to the problem of numerically integrating these equations of motion in real time @xcite .",
    "although these equations are analogous to the classical kinetic equations , which have proved to be useful for classical transport problems , such equations can not be derived in a quantum mechanical framework without significant approximations and/or assumptions .",
    "for example , the quantum boltzmann equation is based on the assumption that the effects of collisions between electrons can be described by the rates determined from fermi s golden rule , and hence it is regarded as a semi - classical equation @xcite .",
    "similarly , the quantum fokker - planck equation can be derived from the caldeira - leggett hamiltonian under a markovian approximation , but in order for this to be possible , the heat bath must be at a sufficiently high temperature , in which case most of the important quantum dynamical effects play a minor role @xcite .",
    "treatments of these kinds are therefore not sufficient to construct fully quantum mechanical descriptions of broad validity",
    ". to circumvent this problem , we present a quantum mechanical approach , which is valid for arbitrary temperatures .",
    "this treatment employs the reduced hierarchy equations of motion ( heom ) , and it can be used in application to systems for which fully quantum mechanical description is necessary @xcite . in particular , the reduced heom approach can be used to numerically treat non - markovian system - bath coupling in a non - perturbative manner @xcite . here , we apply this approach to study the dynamics of a resonant tunneling diode ( rtd ) described by the caldeira - leggett hamiltonian .    the rtd system that we consider is modeled by a double barrier structure with an electrostatic potential representing a region consisting of an undoped layer positioned between two doped layers .",

    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the double barrier structure constitutes a single quantum well with discretized energy states for electrons which are called resonant levels .",
    "the number of resonant levels depends on the height of the barriers .",
    "when a bias is applied to the rtd system , as long as the energy of electrons which flow in the rtd is lower than the energy of the resonant level , the most of electrons are reflected by the barrier because of the small transmission coefficient .",
    "when the energy of the electrons matches the resonant energy , electrons can go through the barriers efficiently due to resonant tunneling , and the current acquires the maximum value . on the other hand , the current decreases",
    "after the energy of the electrons exceeds the resonant energy . as a result , rtd systems exhibit characteristic negative differential resistance ( ndr ) in the current - voltage ( i - v ) relation @xcite . until now , rtds have been mostly used as high - frequency oscillators device using ndr characteristics because the tunneling is the fastest charge - transport mechanism in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "resonant tunneling diodes are presently the highest - frequency active semiconductor devices in existence @xcite and oscillation frequencies above 1 thz have recently been realized @xcite . from a fundamental physics point - of - view",

    "kluksdahl et al",
    ". incorporated dissipative and self - consistent effects , employing the poisson - boltzmann equation by adopting a relaxation time approximation , and succeeded in modeling the experimentally observed hysteresis behavior of the i - v curve @xcite .",
    "jensen and buot developed a numerical scheme to treat systems of the same kind and found evidence that the current oscillation and plateau - like behavior arise from intrinsic bistability @xcite .    when plateau - like behavior and hysteresis of the i - v curve in the ndr region , which were thought to arise from the feedback of the electrostatic field , were experimentally observed @xcite",
    ", sollner claimed that they result merely from resonance with the external circuit @xcite .",
    "although theoretical calculations have provided evidence of intrinsic bistability and self - excited current oscillations in the ndr region , such phenomena have not been justified by experimental means . in addition , because there exists no well - established methodology that can be applied rigorously to this type of model and includes the effect of dissipation , which is the origin of joule heat , previous theoretical results have not been well justified .",

    "when the emitter basin becomes sufficiently deeper , there appear resonant tunneling states between the emitter basin and the double - barrier well . in such a case , we find current oscillation and a plateau of the i - v curve in the ndr region . in the case of decreasing bias ,",
    "however , because there is no resonant tunneling state between the emitter basin and double - barrier well , the current is much smaller than in the case of the increasing bias .",
    "this difference causes the hysteresis behavior .    to elucidate this point more clearly ,",
    "we solve the steady - state schrdinger equation for the regions of emitter basin and the double - barrier well , to obtain approximate eigenstates and eigenenergies of an electron whose energy is lower than the continuous energy band on the emitter side . since bound states are not formed in the collector side of the potential , we exclude this region from the calculations . it should be noted that we employ the time - averaged potential for the purpose of the graph , but the effective potential and the corresponding eigenstates actually vary in time , because they depend on the electron distribution function , and it varies in time . thus , for example , the identifications of the first ( red ) and second ( green ) eigenstates and the third ( blue ) and fourth ( orange ) eigenstates change in time , often becoming degenerate and interchanging . in addition , we ignore the continuous band on the collector side and the influence of the heat bath when calculating the eigenstates and eigenenergies . for this reason ,",
    "the calculated eigenenergies are not precise , but we find that they are sufficient for determining the cause of the current oscillation , because each resonant frequency is rather isolated when estimating the oscillation frequency .",
    "we find that each oscillation peak in both the large and small oscillation cases can be attributed to transitions between eigenstates in the emitter basin , as depicted in the insets of figures 3(i - a)-3(iii-a ) .",
    "as shown in figures 3 ( i - b ) and 3 ( iii-b ) , the first and second eigenstates are the tunneling states in the large oscillation case , while the third eigenstate in figures 3 ( ii - b ) and ( iii - b ) is the tunneling state in the small oscillation case .",
    "when we compare the profiles of each eigenstate and the electron density distributions , we find that the tunneling state and the higher energy eigenstate close to the tunneling state are populated in both cases .",
    "thus , we conclude that the current oscillation results from transitions between these two states , with the frequency of the oscillation determined by the frequency of these transitions . since both the first and second eigenstates change in time , the amplitude of current becomes large in the large oscillation case . when the structure of the emitter basin becomes stable with respect to change of the bias voltage , a plateau forms . as the size of the contact regions increases ,",
    "the transition frequencies decrease , because the size of the emitter basin increases , while the depth of the basin does not change .",
    "this accounts for the peak shift seen in figures 3 ( i - a ) and 3 ( iii-a ) and figures 3 ( ii - a ) and 3 ( iii - a ) . for a small size of contact regions , the emitter basin becomes more stable with respect to change in the bias voltage and as the result the plateau becomes larger . both figures",
    "2 ( ii ) and ( iii ) exhibit double plateau - like features in the ndr region , but we find current oscillation only in the upper plateau in the case of figure 2 ( ii ) .",
    "this is because the dissipation in the large oscillation case of figure 2(ii ) is not sufficiently strong to create significant population of the tunneling states in the case of a small basin , for which the resonant frequencies between the tunneling states and adjacent states are large . in our previous study @xcite",
    ", we considered the same condition as in figure 2 ( iii ) , with a value of @xmath14 half as large ( @xmath134 thz ) .",
    "in that case , however , there was only upper plateau oscillation , while we observed the bistability and the double plateau - like feature .",
    "this is because the effective system - bath coupling strength in the previous case is weaker than in the present case @xcite .",
    "thus , in that case , the ground tunneling states are not populated from the conduction band through dissipation .",
    "note , however , that if the system - bath coupling is too strong , dissipation suppresses the current oscillation , as explained in appendix b.     current oscillation with a large amplitude observed in the lower part of the double - plateau structure at the times marked on the red curve in figure 2 ( iii - b ) depicted as snapshots of the wigner distribution .",

    "we have been able to characterize the patterns of the time evolution of the wigner distribution for two types of current oscillations , with large and small oscillation amplitude . here",
    ", we describe these two types in detail , using as one reference , the large oscillation case in figure 2 ( iii - a ) and the small oscillation case in figure 2 ( ii - a ) . in figure 4 , we display snapshots of the wigner distribution function for the case of large oscillation at the times marked on the red curve in figure 2 ( iii - b ) . as illustrated in figures 3 ( i - b ) and 3 ( iii-b )",
    ", the characteristic feature of this type of oscillation is the large electron density near the emitter side of the barrier , which is observed as a distinct peak separated from the conduction band ( at @xmath137 18 nm in figure 3 ( i - b ) and at @xmath137 43 nm in figure 3 ( iii-b ) ) . as a result of this feature ,",
    "the effective potential possesses a deep emitter basin next to the barrier .",
    "the profiles of the eigenstates depicted in figure 3 ( iii-b ) indicate that this peak consists of the first ( red ) to fourth ( orange ) eigenstates .",
    "we find that a small peak near the edge of the conduction state ( at @xmath137 35 nm in figure 3(iii-b ) ) , which arises from the third ( blue ) and fourth ( orange ) eigenstates in figure 3(iii-b ) , also plays an important role in the current oscillation . in the wigner distribution plotted in figure 4(a ) , these two peaks are denoted by a and b , respectively . in the situation depicted in figure 4 ( a ) , the current flows into the system from the emitter side of the boundary , and then it is scattered by the emitter side of the barrier almost elastically , because the kinetic energy of the current electron is much higher than that of the tunneling state .",
    "the scattered current is trapped by the emitter basin and rotates clockwise around the peaks a and b , but , due to dissipation , some of it flows into peak b while losing energy . in the eigenstate representation given in figure 3(iii-b ) , this behavior corresponds to population transfer from the fourth ( orange ) to the third ( blue ) eigenstate . in figure 4 ( b ) , when the third ( blue ) state decays further to the first ( red ) and second ( green ) tunneling states , the height of a increases . as a result ,",
    "peak a becomes higher , while peak b becomes lower . in figure 4(c ) , because peak a is related to the tunneling state , the outflow current becomes larger whenever peak a becomes higher . throughout this process ,",
    "the peaks a and b become higher and lower by turns , in a manner reminiscent of the piston in a two - piston engine . as a result of this motion , the current exhibits oscillation .",
    "this behavior is typical for this large oscillation case . because there is no current in the case of fig .",
    "4 ( a ) , the oscillation amplitude is large compared to that in the small oscillation case .",
    "if the dissipation is too strong , however , the piston - like motion is suppressed , and there is only steady current , as described in appendix b.     current oscillation with small amplitude observed in the upper part of the double - plateau structure at the times marked on the green curve in figure 2 ( ii ) depicted as snapshots of the wigner distribution .",

    "( b ) the scattered electron flows in a tornado - like manner to peak c in the emitter basin due to dissipation .",
    "( c ) the shaking motion of the effective potential periodically accelerates the component at c to the tunneling state , and the current is thus enhanced.,width=264 ]    in figure 5 , we display snapshots of the wigner distribution for the case of small oscillation at the times marked in figure 2 ( ii - b ) . in figure 5 ( a ) , while current flows into the system from the emitter side of the boundary , that part of it with energy larger than that of the tunneling state is scattered by the emitter side of the barrier .",
    "the remaining current , i.e. , that whose energy is closer to the energy of the tunneling state , flows to the collector side in the form of steady current , through tunneling . in figure 5 ( b ) , it is seen how the scattered electron moves back and forth in the emitter basin , while losing energy due to dissipation . as a result , the electron flows into peak c , exhibiting tornado - like motion .",
    "figure 5 ( c ) depicts shaking motion of the effective potential that periodically accelerates the electron distribution in peak c to the tunneling state .",
    "through this effect , current flows to the collector side through the barrier . due to synchronization with this shaking motion ,",
    "the current is enhanced periodically .",
    "this tornado - like motion is typical for the small oscillation case . because there is a large contribution from steady current , the oscillation amplitude here is smaller than in the large oscillation case .",
    "in summary , we investigated current oscillations in the plateau structures of the ndr region for three sizes of the contact regions with a model that includes damping , employing the caldeira - leggett hamiltonian .",
    "we found two distinct types of current oscillations .",
    "the first type is observed in the single plateau and in the lower part of the double - plateau structure .",
    "it is characterized by a large oscillation amplitude and a single fourier component .",
    "the other type is observed in the upper part of double - plateau structure .",
    "it is characterized by a small oscillation amplitude and two fourier components .",
    "an emitter basin that forms on the emitter side of the effective potential plays a key role in creating the current oscillation .",
    "eigenstate analysis indicates that the first type is caused by transitions between the ground tunneling state and the adjacent excited state in the emitter basin , while the second type is caused by transitions between the intermediate tunneling state and higher states .",
    "because the transition frequencies are large in the case of narrow emitter basin , there is high frequency oscillation in the case of small contact regions for a fixed basin depth . in wigner space ,",
    "these two types of oscillation are characterized by the two types of motion : two - piston engine - like motion and tornado - like motion .",
    "dissipation plays an important role in the realization of current oscillation . in order for the ground tunneling state to be populated in the case of large oscillation , there must be fairly strong dissipation , whose strength is determined by the system - bath coupling and the noise correlation time . if the dissipation is too strong , however , the current oscillation vanishes due to damping .",
    "the key to have non - trivial behaviors such as hysteresis , single / double plateaus and self - excited current oscillations is on the existence of the resonant tunneling states , the charge redistribution effects and the dissipation .",
    "the present results may be helpful to design nano - devices including a molecular junction system @xcite .",
    "although many efforts have been made to improve wigner transportation theory @xcite , the quantum boltzmann equation @xcite , and other formalisms @xcite to study quantum dissipative dynamics in nano - devices , there are still a number of limitations and many subtle problems on such formalisms , which deserve further attention .",
    "on the basis of the reduced hierarchy equations of motion ( heom ) approach , our investigation was carried out through highly accurate numerical calculations applied to a tunneling device system in a non - markovian environment at finite temperature .",
    "we have provided evidence of intrinsic bistability and self - excited current oscillations in the ndr region rigorously .",
    "while the current oscillation experimentally observed in the rtd induced by the resonance with external circuit@xcite , however , these effects are not accounted for in our approach like many other theories based on the boltzmann approach . to investigate the relation between the experimentally observed current oscillations and the existence of intrinsic current oscillation",

    "<S> the quantum dissipative dynamics of a tunneling process through double barrier structures is investigated on the basis of non - perturbative and non - markovian treatment . </S>",
    "<S> we employ a caldeira - leggett hamiltonian with an effective potential calculated self - consistently , accounting for the electron distribution . with this hamiltonian , </S>",
    "<S> we use the reduced hierarchy equations of motion in the wigner space representation to study non - markovian and non - perturbative thermal effects at finite temperature in a rigorous manner . </S>",
    "<S> we study current variation in time and the current - voltage ( i - v ) relation of the resonant tunneling diode for several widths of the contact region , which consists of doped gaas . hysteresis and both single and double plateau - like behavior are observed in the negative differential resistance ( ndr ) region . while all of the current oscillations decay in time in the ndr region in the case of a strong system - bath coupling , there exist self - excited high - frequency current oscillations in some parts of the plateau in the ndr region in the case of weak coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the effective potential in the oscillating case possesses a basin - like form on the emitter side ( emitter basin ) and that the current oscillation results from tunneling between the emitter basin and the quantum well in the barriers . </S>",
    "<S> we find two distinct types of current oscillations , with large and small oscillation amplitudes , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these two types of oscillation appear differently in the wigner space , with one exhibiting tornado - like motion and the other exhibiting a two piston engine - like motion . </S>"
