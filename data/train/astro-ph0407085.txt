    "up to feb . 1 , 2004 , 21 new sources were detected with integral according to reports in the literature , see table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "they are all within 7 degrees from the galactic plane and it is likely that most are located in the galaxy . some are obscured in the classical 2 - 10 kev band by thick absorption columns ( @xmath0  @xmath1 ) , others are quick transients with activity periods of less than a day .",
    "both kinds are interesting .",
    "if they are x - ray binaries , this suggests deviations from pure roche - lobe overflow which is the standard in low - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "the thick local absorption columns could be indicative of massive in or outflows outside the accretion disk plane ( if eclipses nor dips are present ) , while the short durations are reminiscent of the black hole transient v4641 sgr .",
    "a fraction of the new sources has been detected in earlier observations with instruments on asca , bepposax and rxte .",
    "we here discuss the earlier detections with the bepposax wide field cameras .",
    "thanks to its large field of view ( 40@xmath2 with 5@xmath3 angular resolution , similar to ibis ) and a bandpass that extends to the unobscured @xmath4  kev part , the contribution of the wfcs to the understanding of these transients may be relevant .",
    "for instance , an accurate flux history of these hard sources will provide strong constraints on the suggested transient nature of some sources .",
    "the wfcs were operational between june 1996 and april 2002 , in other words in the six years preceding the launch of integral .",
    "the wfc data archive has a substantial coverage over large parts of the sky . along the galactic plane ,",
    "the exposure time is always in excess of 1 million seconds .",
    "the peak of the coverage coincides with the galactic center where 6 million seconds of net exposure time was obtained .",
    "typical sensitivities are a few mcrab for months - long observation times . for a recent review of these observations , we refer to in t zand et al .",

    "the maximum flux observed with bepposax - wfc is 0.03 c  s@xmath6@xmath1 ( 2 - 28 kev ) , or 15 mcrab , on april 26 , 1997 , and the lowest flux 1.5 mcrab for the combined data of jul - dec 1996 ( 257 ks exposure ) .",
    "all upper limits are worse than the lowest detected flux .",
    "the 6-year average is @xmath7 mcrab . since it is located in the scutum arm of our galaxy where many hmxbs were detected in the past ( cf koyama et al .",
    "1990 ; see fig .",
    "[ ssum2 ] ) , it may also be a hmxb .",
    "igr j19140 + 098 was detected in ibis in march 2003 ( hannikainen et al . 2003 ) and may 2003 ( cabanac et al . 2004a ) .",
    "the peak flux was 0.1 crab ( 13 - 100 kev ) .",
    "a brief ( 3 ksec ) follow - up observation was performed by rxte in march 2003 when it peaked at about 10 mcrab in 2 - 10 kev ( swank & markwardt 2003 ) .",
    "the spectrum is variable with a transient fe - k emission line complex ( with equivalent width 550 ev during the rxte observation ) and a power law with photon index between 1.7 and 3 .",
    "the source shows significant variability on time scales longer than 100  s.    this source also has limited coverage by the bepposax wfcs .",
    "all 1-d wfc detections cluster around 10 mcrab ( similar to what was observed with rxte ) , and the 6-month averages vary between an upper limit of 1 mcrab ( 3@xmath8 ) and a detection of @xmath9 mcrab ( for jan - jun 1998 )",
    ". the position is @xmath10 ( error radius 2 ) .",
    "the 6-year average is @xmath11 mcrab ( exposure time 1.5 msec ; see fig .",
    "[ ssum2 ] ) .",
    "all wfc detections are insufficient to provide meaningful constraints on pulse signal amplitudes or spectra .",
    "based on coordinates extracted from the simbad database at cds strasbourg , we identified this source with a exo  1912 + 097 .",
    "this is a source which was identified in exosat data in the nineties through a new detection algorithm by lu et al .",
    ". however , investigation of the lu et al .",
    "paper , which is written in chinese , yielded that the error circle of exo 1912 + 097 is actually shifted by such an amount that the wfc and integral source positions are on the edge of the error circle .",
    "therefore , it is slightly questionable whether the exosat source is related to the wfc and integral sources . for details ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ k1914 ] .",
    "the source was often detected with wfc and integral , but at flux levels close to the detection limit .",
    "therefore , it is feasible that the source is strongly variable but persistent .",
    "a determination of its physical nature would benefit from high - spatial - resolution observations at x - ray and optical wavelengths , also to confirm the tentative identification with a radio counterpart ( schulz et al .",
    "2004 ; pandey et al .",
    "bepposax - wfc provided detections of 5 out of 21 of the new integral sources in the classical x - ray band .",
    "the flux levels of these detections are all except one below @xmath12  .",
    "the one exception is a clear transient which goes into outburst for a few hours at least once a year .",
    "one other source shows the hallmarks of a classical though faint transient : igr j17091 - 3624 .",
    "the other three sources exhibit detections in the combined 6-year wfc data which , for fluxes which were rarely measured to be above a factor of 10 of the 6-year averages , implies that they are most likely low - flux persistent sources .",
    "the two transients are very likely x - ray binaries in our galaxy .",
    "the nature of the three fainter but possibly persistent sources is less well constrained , but probably also x - ray binaries in the galaxy ."
