    "the rutherford centennial is celebrating rutherford s discovery of the atomic nucleus in 1911 by scattering alpha - particles on a gold foil . since then scattering experiments have come a long way , improving the resolution from about @xmath2 times the proton radius ( @xmath3  fm ) in 1911 to about @xmath4 as achieved by the hera experiments @xcite at the so far only @xmath5 collider . here , i want to describe the current achievements in the extraction of the parton density functions ( pdfs ) of the proton and of the strong qcd coupling from inclusive and jet measurements in dis at hera .",
    "inclusive neutral current ( nc ) and charged current ( cc ) measurements , in leading order ( lo ) represented by the quark - parton model , are sensitive to the valence and sea quarks of the proton . only at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and beyond",
    "do they become sensitive to the gluon density ( scaling violations ) and the strong coupling , which are however strongly correlated .",
    "inclusive jets in dis , when measured for example in the breit frame , are sensitive to the gluon density and the strong coupling already in lo , via the boson - gluon fusion process .",
    "this process dominates for the negative photon momentum transfer squared , or photon virtuality , @xmath6 , less than about @xmath7  gev@xmath8 . above that value",
    "the qcd - compton process becomes dominant , providing sensitivity to the strong coupling without being correlated to the gluon .",
    "therefore , one can expect that the addition of jet measurements to the hitherto mainly used inclusive measurements alone will allow a reduction of the correlation between the gluon density and the strong coupling , thereby making it possible to extract simultaneously both pdfs and the strong coupling from dis data .",
    "the idea behind the herapdfs is to use only hera nc and cc data in the fits .",
    "combined inclusive cross sections from the h1 and zeus experiments are used , which have increased precision due to statistics but also due to intercalibration effects made possible by the two complementary detectors .",
    "thus , precise combined data sets with total uncertainties between @xmath9 ( for nc ) over most of the phase space are used .",
    "the systematic correlated and uncorrelated errors are well controlled , such that the standard @xmath10 uncertainty criterion can be used .",
    "since hera data only include @xmath11 data , there are no uncertainties due to for example deuterium or heavy target corrections .",
    "two parametrizations have been studied : a @xmath12 parameter fit which was used for the published herapdf1.0 @xcite and for the preliminary herapdf1.5 @xcite , and a @xmath13 parameter fit , for the preliminary herapdf1.5f and herapdf1.6 @xcite .",
    "the latter parametrization provides more flexibility , in particular for the gluon density at low @xmath14 , which is preferred because of the additional jet data . at the @xmath15",
    "starting scale the pdfs are parametrized as follows : @xmath16 in the @xmath13 parameter fit @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are constrained by the momentum and quark sum rules .",
    "furthermore it is assumed that @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the strange sea fraction at @xmath15 .",
    "these choices define the central fit , as adding more parameters does not significantly reduce the @xmath24 .",
    "the parametrization uncertainty is estimated by adding one additional parameter at a time , changing the parametrizations and varying the starting scale @xmath15 around the default value of @xmath25  gev@xmath8 .",
    "a model uncertainty is determined by varying the heavy quark masses , @xmath23 and @xmath26 around their default values .",
    "@xmath26 specifies the minimal @xmath6 for a data point to be included in the fit .",
    "the fit of the pdfs is performed using the nlo dglap equations , employing the qcdnum @xcite evolution code .",
    "charm and beauty quarks are treated as massive in the thorne - roberts variable - flavor - number scheme @xcite .",
    "the jet production cross sections are calculated with the fastnlo code @xcite , which efficiently convolutes the matrix elements , calculated using the nlojet++ program @xcite , with the fitted pdfs . here",
    "is not the place to discuss this , but it should be mentioned that herapdf1.0 and herapdf1.5 fits have been also performed using evolution equations in next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . for the reader who wants to know more details and updates on the herapdfs",
    ", they can be found here @xcite .",
    "the data used in the extraction of the pdfs and the strong coupling @xmath0 are the combined nc and cc @xmath27 and @xmath28 inclusive cross sections from the hera - i @xcite and hera - ii running periods @xcite .",
    "in addition , the following jet measurements from the h1 and zeus collaborations were used : normalized inclusive jet cross sections for @xmath29  gev@xmath8 @xcite , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath30  pb@xmath31 , and inclusive jet cross sections for @xmath32  gev@xmath8 @xcite , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath33  pb@xmath31 , and inclusive jet cross sections from two running periods in hera - i for @xmath34  gev@xmath8 @xcite , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath35  pb@xmath31 , and for @xmath36  gev@xmath8 @xcite , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of @xmath37  pb@xmath31 .",
    "the pdfs as a function of @xmath14 at @xmath38  gev@xmath8 , when going from herapdf1.5 ( 10 parameters ) to herapdf1.5f ( 14 parameters ) with fixed @xmath39 , show an overall similar total uncertainty .",
    "the latter yields a softer sea density at high @xmath14 and a suppressed d - valence density at low @xmath14 . keeping @xmath0 fixed and including the jet measurements , which leads to the herapdf1.6 fit , one observes little difference in the pdfs and their uncertainties , only the high @xmath14 gluon uncertainty is somewhat reduced . the respective figures can be found in @xcite .",
    "more interesting results are obtained when the fits for herapdf1.5f ( no jets ) and herapdf1.6 ( with jets ) are performed with @xmath0 treated as a free fit parameter .",
    "the corresponding pdfs and their uncertainty bands are shown in fig.[fig1 ] .     for @xmath38  gev@xmath8 with @xmath0 as an additional free parameter in the fit , and ( c ) @xmath40 for both fits .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] ( -126.0,121.0)(a )   for @xmath38  gev@xmath8 with @xmath0 as an additional free parameter in the fit , and ( c ) @xmath40 for both fits .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] ( -126.0,121.0)(b ) ( -126.0,121.0)(c )    adding the jet data leads to a dramatic decrease of the low @xmath14 gluon uncertainty , not only of the experimental uncertainty , but also of the model and parametrization ones . in fig.[fig1]c",
    "the @xmath40 distributions are shown as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the herapdf1.5f fit shows a shallow minimum , while the herapdf1.6 fit provides a strong constraint on the value of @xmath0 .",
    "the addition of the jet data successfully reduces the correlation of the strong coupling and the gluon density , for reasons discussed in the introduction .",
    "the increase in the uncertainty of the gluon density due to @xmath0 being a free parameter is not large when jet data are included .",
    "the fit yields the following value for the strong coupling :    68 mm    * figure 2 . * @xmath0 values from herapdf1.6 ,    from jet production in dis , by the h1 and    zeus collaborations , and the world average .",
    "[ fig3 ]    @xmath41 the hadronization uncertainty is due to the corresponding corrections of the nlo jet cross sections .",
    "the uncertainty due to the scale is estimated by a variation of the renormalization and factorization scale by the conventional factor of @xmath42 and @xmath43 when calculating the jet cross sections .",
    "for the inclusive cross sections this uncertainty was assumed to be negligible .    in fig.2",
    "the results on @xmath0 are displayed from herapdf1.6 and as obtained from recent extractions by h1 and zeus using only jet production data in dis .",
    "the experimental and theoretical uncertainties are indicated separately .",
    "for herapdf1.6 the uncertainty due to the pdfs is part of the experimental uncertainty , while for the jets only results it is part of the theory uncertainty .",
    "the values obtained using different methods and experiments are experimentally very precise .",
    "they are consistent with each other and with the world average .",
    "a nlo qcd fit with simultaneous determinations of the proton pdfs and @xmath0 was performed using hera dis data only .",
    "combined h1 and zeus inclusive nc and cc cross sections together with inclusive jet cross sections from the h1 and zeus collaborations have been used . including jet data in the fit and treating @xmath0 as a free parameter , dramatically reduces the correlations between the gluon density and the strong coupling compared to the fit without jets .",
    "the precision of the gluon density is improved , and an accurate and unbiased determination of @xmath0 is achieved , yielding a value consistent with the world average .",
