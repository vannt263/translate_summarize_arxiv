    "this article has several goals .",
    "the primary goal is to provide the reader with a thorough survey of the current state of knowledge on efficient algorithms for computing topological invariants of semi - algebraic sets  and in particular their betti numbers . at the same time we want to provide graduate students who intend to pursue research in the area of algorithmic semi - algebraic geometry , a primer on the main technical tools used in the recent developments in this area , so that they can start to use these themselves in their own work .",
    "lastly , for experts in closely related areas who might want to use the results described in the paper , we want to present self - contained descriptions of these results in a usable form",
    ".    with this in mind we first give a short introduction to the main algorithmic problems in semi - algebraic geometry , their history , as well as brief descriptions of the main mathematical and algorithmic tools used in the design of efficient algorithms for solving these problems .",
    "we then provide a more detailed description of the more recent advances in the area of designing efficient algorithms for computing the betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets .",
    "since the design of these algorithms draw on several new ideas from diverse areas , we describe some of the most important ones in some detail for the reader s benefit .",
    "the goal is to provide the reader with a short but comprehensive introduction to the mathematical tools that have proved to be useful in the area .",
    "the reader who is interested in being up - to - date with the recent developments in this area , but not interested in pursuing research in the area , can safely skip the more technical sections . throughout the survey",
    "we omit most proofs referring the reader to the appropriate references where such proofs appear .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : background ] we discuss the background , significance , and history of algorithmic problems in semi - algebraic geometry and topology . in section [ sec : results ] we state some of the recent results in the field . in section",
    "[ sec : algoprelim ] we outline a few of the basic algorithmic tools used in the design of algorithms for dealing with semi - algebraic sets .",
    "these include the cylindrical algebraic decomposition , as well as the critical point method exemplified by the roadmap algorithm . in section [ sec : topbackground ]",
    "we provide the reader some relevant facts and definitions from algebraic topology which are used in the more modern algorithms , including definitions of cohomology of simplicial complexes as well as semi - algebraic sets , the nerve lemma and its generalizations for non - leray covers , the descent spectral sequence and the basic properties of homotopy colimits . in section [ sec : bettifew ]",
    "we describe recent progress in the design of algorithms for computing the higher betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets . in section [ sec : quadratic ] we restrict our attention to sets defined by quadratic inequalities , and describe recent progress in the design of efficient algorithms for computing the betti numbers of such sets . in section [ sec : arrangements ] we describe a simplified version of an older algorithm for efficiently computing the betti numbers of an arrangement  where the emphasis is on obtaining tight bounds on the combinatorial complexity only ( the algebraic part of the complexity being assumed to be bounded by a constant ) .",
    "we end by listing some open problems in section [ sec : open ] .    [ [ prerequisites ] ] _ prerequisites _ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    in this survey we are aiming at a wide audience .",
    "we expect that the reader has a basic background in algebra , has some familiarity with simplicial complexes and their homology , and the theory of np and # p - completeness . beyond these",
    "we make no additional assumption of any prior advanced knowledge of semi - algebraic geometry , algebraic topology , or the theory of computational complexity .",
    "we first fix some notation .",
    "let @xmath0 be a real closed field ( for example , the field @xmath1 of real numbers or @xmath2 of real algebraic numbers ) .",
    "a semi - algebraic subset of @xmath3 is a set defined by a finite system of polynomial equalities and inequalities , or more generally by a boolean formula whose atoms are polynomial equalities and inequalities .",
    "given a finite set @xmath4 of polynomials in @xmath5 $ ] , a subset @xmath6 of @xmath7 is @xmath4-semi - algebraic if @xmath6 is the realization of a boolean formula with atoms @xmath8 , @xmath9 or @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "it is clear that for every semi - algebraic subset @xmath6 of @xmath3 there exists a finite set @xmath4 of polynomials in @xmath5 $ ] such that @xmath6 is @xmath4-semi - algebraic .",
    "we call a semi - algebraic set a @xmath4-closed semi - algebraic set if it is defined by a boolean formula with no negations with atoms @xmath8 , @xmath12 , or @xmath13 with @xmath11 .    for an element",
    "@xmath14 we let @xmath15    a _ sign condition _ on @xmath4 is an element of @xmath16 . for any semi - algebraic set @xmath17",
    "the _ realization of the sign condition @xmath18 over @xmath19 _",
    ", @xmath20 , is the semi - algebraic set [ def : r(z ) ] @xmath21 and in case @xmath22 we will denote @xmath20 by just @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath4 is a finite subset of @xmath24 $ ] , we write the set of zeros of @xmath4 in @xmath3 as @xmath25    we will denote by @xmath26 the open ball with center 0 and radius @xmath27 in @xmath3 .",
    "we will also denote by @xmath28 the unit sphere in @xmath29 centered at the origin .",
    "notice that these sets are semi - algebraic .    for any semi - algebraic set @xmath30 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath31 the closure of @xmath30 , which is also a semi - algebraic set by the tarksi - seidenberg principle @xcite ( see @xcite for a modern treatment ) . the tarksi - seidenberg principle states that the class of semi - algebraic sets is closed under linear projections or equivalently that the first order theory of the reals admits quantifier elimination .",
    "it is an easy exercise to verify that the closure of a semi - algebraic set admits a description by a quantified first order formula .    for any semi - algebraic set @xmath6",
    ", we will denote by @xmath32 its @xmath33-th betti number , which is the dimension of the @xmath33-th cohomology group , @xmath34 , taken with rational coefficients , which in our setting is also isomorphic to the @xmath33-th homology group , @xmath35 ( see section [ subsec : sahomology ] below for precise definitions of these groups ) .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 is the number of semi - algebraically connected components of @xmath6 .",
    "we will sometimes refer to the sum @xmath37 as the _ topological complexity _ of a semi - algebraic set @xmath6 .",
    "[ rem : homologyvscohomology ] departing from usual practice , in the description of the algorithms occurring later in this paper we will mostly refer to the cohomology groups instead of the homology groups .",
    "even though the geometric interpretation of the cohomology groups is a bit more obscure than that for homology groups ( see section [ subsubsec : homologyvscohomology ] below ) , it turns out that from the point of view of designing algorithms for computing betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets ( at least for those discussed in this survey ) the usual geometric interpretation of homology as measuring the number of `` holes '' or `` tunnels '' etc .",
    "is of little use , and the main concepts behind these algorithms are better understood from the cohomological point of view .",
    "this is the reason why we emphasize cohomology over homology in what follows .",
    "algorithmic problems in semi - algebraic geometry typically consist of the following . we are given as input a finite family , @xmath38 $ ] , as well as a formula defining a @xmath4-semi - algebraic set @xmath6 .",
    "the task is to decide whether certain geometric and topological properties hold for @xmath6 , and in some cases also computing certain topological invariants of @xmath6 .",
    "some of the most basic problems include the following .    given a @xmath4-semi - algebraic set @xmath39 :    1 .",
    "decide whether it is empty or not , 2 .",
    "given two points @xmath40 decide if they are in the same connected component of @xmath6 and if so output a semi - algebraic path in @xmath6 joining them , 3 .",
    "compute semi - algebraic descriptions of the connected components of @xmath6 , 4 .",
    "compute semi - algebraic descriptions of the projection of @xmath6 onto some linear subspace of @xmath3 ( this problem is also known as the quantifier elimination problem for the first order theory of the reals and many other problems can be posed as special cases of this very general problem ) .    at a deeper level",
    "we have problems of more topological flavor , such as :    * compute the cohomology groups of @xmath6 , its betti numbers , its euler - poincar characteristic etc .",
    ", * compute a semi - algebraic triangulation of @xmath6 ( cf . definition [ def : triangulation ] below ) , as well as * compute a decomposition of @xmath6 into semi - algebraic smooth pieces of various dimensions which fit together nicely ( a whitney - regular stratification ) .    the complexity of an algorithm for solving any of the above problems is measured in terms of the following three parameters :    * the number of polynomials , @xmath41 , * the maximum degree , @xmath42 , and * the number of variables , @xmath43 .    a typical input to the algorithms considered in this survey will be a set of polynomials with coefficients in an ordered ring @xmath44 ( which can be taken to be the ring generated by the coeffcients of the input polynomials ) . by complexity of an algorithm",
    "we will mean the number of arithmetic operations ( including comparisons ) performed by the algorithm in the ring @xmath44 . in case the input polynomials have integer coefficients with bounded bit - size",
    ", then we will often give the bit - complexity , which is the number of bit operations performed by the algorithm .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite[chapter 8 ] for a full discussion about the various measures of complexity .    even though the goal is always to design algorithms with the best possible complexity in terms of all the parameters @xmath45 ,",
    "the relative importance of the parameters is very much application dependent .",
    "for instance , in applications in _ computational geometry _ it is the _ combinatorial _ complexity ( that is the dependence on @xmath46 ) that is of paramount importance , the _ algebraic _ part depending on @xmath47 , as well as the dimension @xmath43 , are assumed to be bounded by constants . on the other hand in algorithmic real algebraic geometry , and in applications in complexity theory , the algebraic part depending on @xmath47 is considered to be equally important .      even though there exist algorithms for solving all the above problems , the main research problem is to design _ efficient _ algorithms for solving them .",
    "the complexity of the first decision procedure given by tarski @xcite to solve problems 1 and 4 listed in section [ subsec : problems ] is not elementary recursive , which implies that the running time can not be bounded by a function of the size of the input which is a fixed tower of exponents .",
    "the first algorithm with a significantly better worst - case time bound was given by collins @xcite in 1976 .",
    "his algorithm had a worst case running time doubly exponential in the number of variables .",
    "collins method is to obtain a cylindrical algebraic decomposition of the given semi - algebraic set ( see section [ subsec : cad ] below for definition ) .",
    "once this decomposition is computed most topological questions about semi - algebraic sets such as those listed in section [ subsec : problems ] can be answered .",
    "however , this method involves cascading projections which involve squaring of the degrees at each step resulting in a complexity which is doubly exponential in the number of variables .",
    "most of the recent work in algorithmic semi - algebraic geometry has focused on obtaining _ single exponential time _",
    "algorithms  that is algorithms with complexity of the order of @xmath48 rather than @xmath49 .",
    "an important motivating reason behind the search for such algorithms , is the following theorem due to gabrielov and vorobjov @xcite ( see @xcite , as well as the survey article @xcite , for work leading up to this result ) .    @xcite",
    "[ the : gv ] for a @xmath4-semi - algebraic set @xmath39 , the sum of the betti numbers of @xmath6 ( refer to section [ sec : topbackground ] below for definition ) is bounded by @xmath50 , where @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "for the special case of @xmath4-closed semi - algebraic sets the following slightly better bound was known before @xcite ( and this bound is used in an essential way in the proof of theorem [ the : gv ] ) . using the same notation as in theorem [ the : gv ] above we have    @xcite [ the : b99 ] for a @xmath4-closed semi - algebraic set @xmath39 , the sum of the betti numbers of @xmath6 is bounded by @xmath51 .",
    "[ rem : lowerbound ] these bounds are asymptotically tight , as can be already seen from the example where each @xmath11 is a product of @xmath47 generic polynomials of degree one .",
    "the number of connected components of the @xmath4-semi - algebraic set defined as the subset of @xmath3 where all polynomials in @xmath4 are non - zero is clearly bounded from below by @xmath52 .",
    "notice also that the above bound has single exponential rather than double exponential dependence on @xmath43 .",
    "algorithms with single exponential complexity have now been given for several of the problems listed above and there have been a sequence of improvements in the complexities of such algorithms .",
    "we now have single exponential algorithms for deciding emptiness of semi - algebraic sets @xcite , quantifier elimination @xcite , deciding connectivity @xcite , computing descriptions of the connected components @xcite , computing the euler - poincar characteristic ( see section [ subsubsec : ep ] below for definition ) @xcite , as well as the first few ( that is , any constant number of ) betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets @xcite .",
    "these algorithms answer questions about the semi - algebraic set @xmath6 without obtaining a full cylindrical algebraic decomposition ( see section [ subsec : cad ] below for definition ) , which makes it possible to avoid having double exponential complexity .",
    "moreover , polynomial time algorithms are now known for computing some of these invariants for special classes of semi - algebraic sets @xcite .",
    "we describe some of these new results in greater detail in section [ sec : results ] .      since general semi - algebraic sets can have exponential topological complexity ( cf .",
    "remark [ rem : lowerbound ] ) , it is natural to consider certain restricted classes of semi - algebraic sets .",
    "one natural class consists of semi - algebraic sets defined by a conjunction of quadratic inequalities .",
    "since sets defined by linear inequalities have no interesting topology , sets defined by quadratic inequalities can be considered to be the simplest class of semi - algebraic sets which can have non - trivial topology .",
    "such sets are in fact quite general , since every semi - algebraic set can be defined by a ( quantified ) formula involving only quadratic polynomials ( at the cost of increasing the number of variables and the size of the formula ) . moreover , as in the case of general semi - algebraic sets , the betti numbers of such sets can be exponentially large .",
    "for example , the set @xmath39 defined by @xmath53 has @xmath54 .",
    "hence , it is somewhat surprising that for any constant @xmath55 , the betti numbers @xmath56 , of a basic closed semi - algebraic set @xmath39 defined by quadratic inequalities , are polynomially bounded .",
    "the following theorem which appears in @xcite is derived using a bound proved by barvinok @xcite on the betti numbers of sets defined by few quadratic equations .    @xcite",
    "[ the : quadratic ] let @xmath0 a real closed field and @xmath39 be defined by @xmath57 then , for any @xmath55 , @xmath58    notice that for fixed @xmath59 this gives a polynomial bound on the highest @xmath59 betti numbers of @xmath6 ( which could possibly be non - zero ) .",
    "observe also that similar bounds do not hold for sets defined by polynomials of degree greater than two .",
    "for instance , the set @xmath60 defined by the single quartic inequality , @xmath61 will have @xmath62 , for all small enough @xmath63 .    to see this",
    "observe that for all sufficiently small @xmath63 , @xmath64 is defined by @xmath65 and has @xmath66 connected components since it retracts onto the set @xmath67 .",
    "it now follows that @xmath68 where the first equality is a consequence of the well - known alexander duality theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "semi - algebraic sets defined by a system of quadratic inequalities have a special significance in the theory of computational complexity .",
    "even though such sets might seem to be the next simplest class of semi - algebraic sets after sets defined by linear inequalities , from the point of view of computational complexity they represent a quantum leap .",
    "whereas there exist ( weakly ) polynomial time algorithms for solving linear programming , solving quadratic feasibility problem is provably hard . for instance , it follows from an easy reduction from the problem of testing feasibility of a real quartic equation in many variables , that the problem of testing whether a system of quadratic inequalities is feasible is @xmath69-complete in the blum - shub - smale model of computation ( see @xcite ) . assuming the input polynomials to have integer coefficients",
    ", the same problem is np - hard in the classical turing machine model , since it is also not difficult to see that the boolean satisfiability problem can be posed as the problem of deciding whether a certain semi - algebraic set defined by quadratic inequalities is empty or not .",
    "counting the number of connected components of such sets is even harder .",
    "in fact , it is shown in @xcite that for @xmath70 , computing the @xmath59-th betti number of a basic semi - algebraic set defined by quadratic inequalities in @xmath3 is @xmath71p - hard .",
    "in contrast to these hardness results , the polynomial bound on the top betti numbers of sets defined by quadratic inequalities gives rise to the possibility that these might in fact be computable in polynomial time .",
    "a case of intermediate complexity between semi - algebraic sets defined by polynomials of higher degrees and sets defined by a fixed number of quadratic inequalities is obtained by considering linear projections of such sets .",
    "the operation of linear projection of semi - algebraic sets plays a very significant role in algorithmic semi - algebraic geometry .",
    "it is a consequence of the tarski - seidenberg principle ( see for instance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.80 ) ) that the image of a semi - algebraic set under a linear projection is semi - algebraic , and designing efficient algorithms for computing properties of projections of semi - algebraic sets ( such as its description by a quantifier - free formula ) is a central problem of the area and is a very well - studied topic ( see for example @xcite or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 14 ) ) .",
    "however , the complexities of the best algorithms for computing descriptions of projections of general semi - algebraic sets is single exponential in the dimension and do not significantly improve when restricted to the class of semi - algebraic sets defined by a constant number of quadratic inequalities .",
    "indeed , any semi - algebraic set can be realized as the projection of a set defined by quadratic inequalities , and it is not known whether quantifier elimination can be performed efficiently when the number of quadratic inequalities is kept constant . however , it is shown in @xcite that , with a fixed number of inequalities , the projections of such sets are topologically simpler than projections of general semi - algebraic sets .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath72 be a closed and bounded semi - algebraic set defined by @xmath73 with @xmath74 , \\deg(p_i ) \\leq 2 , \\ ; 1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell$ ] .",
    "( for technical reasons , which we do not delve into , it is necessary in this case to restrict ourselves to the case where @xmath75 . )",
    "let @xmath76 be the projection onto the last @xmath77 coordinates . in what follows",
    ", the number of inequalities , @xmath59 , used in the definition of @xmath6 will be considered as fixed . since",
    ", @xmath78 is not necessarily describable using only quadratic inequalities , the bound in theorem [ the : quadratic ] does not hold for @xmath78 and @xmath78 can in principle be quite complicated . using the best known complexity estimates for quantifier elimination algorithms over the reals",
    "( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 14 ) ) , one gets single exponential ( in @xmath43 and @xmath77 ) bounds on the degrees and the number of polynomials necessary to obtain a semi - algebraic description of @xmath78 . in fact , there is no known algorithm for computing a semi - algebraic description of @xmath78 in time polynomial in @xmath43 and @xmath77 . nevertheless , we know that for any constant @xmath79 , the sum of the first @xmath80 betti numbers of @xmath78 is bounded by a polynomial in @xmath43 and @xmath77",
    ".    @xcite [ the : projquad ] let @xmath81 be a closed and bounded semi - algebraic set defined by @xmath82 ,   \\deg(p_i ) \\leq 2 , \\ ; 1 \\leq i \\leq \\ell.\\ ] ] let @xmath76 be the projection onto the last @xmath77 coordinates",
    ". for any @xmath83 , @xmath84    this suggests , from the point of view of designing efficient ( polynomial time ) algorithms in semi - algebraic geometry , that images under linear projections of semi - algebraic sets defined by a constant number of quadratic inequalities , are simpler than general semi - algebraic sets .",
    "so they should be the next natural class of sets to consider , after sets defined by linear and quadratic inequalities .",
    "since in this survey we focus mainly on the algorithmic problem of computing the betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets , which are the dimensions of the various cohomology ( also homology ) groups of such sets , it is perhaps worthwhile to say a few words about our motivations behind computing them , and also their connections with other parts of mathematics , especially with computational complexity theory .",
    "the algorithmic problems of deciding whether a given semi - algebraic set is empty or if it is connected , have obvious applications in many different areas of science and engineering .",
    "( recall that the number of connected components of a semi - algebraic set @xmath6 is equal to its zero - th betti number , @xmath36 . ) for instance , in robotics , the configuration space of a robot can be modeled as a semi - algebraic set .",
    "similarly , in molecular chemistry the conformation space of a molecule with constraints on bond lengths and angles is a semi - algebraic set . in both these cases understanding connectivity information",
    "is important : for solving motion planning problem in robotics , or for determining possible molecular conformations in molecular chemistry .",
    "the higher cohomology groups of semi - algebraic sets , which measure higher dimensional connectivity , do not appear to have such obvious applications .",
    "nevertheless , there exist several reasons why the problem of computing the higher homology groups of semi - algebraic sets is an important problem and we mention a few of these below .",
    "firstly , the algorithmic problem of pinning down the exact topology of any given topological space , such as a semi - algebraic set in @xmath85 , is an exceedingly difficult problem .",
    "in fact , the general problem of determining if two given spaces are homeomorphic is undecidable @xcite . in order to get around this difficulty ,",
    "mathematicians since the time of poincar have devised more easily computable ( albeit weaker ) invariants of topological spaces .",
    "one reason that cohomology groups are so important , is that unlike other topological invariants , they are readily computable  they allow one to discard a large amount of information regarding the topology of a given space , while retaining just enough to derive important _ qualitative _ information about the space in question .",
    "for instance , in the case of semi - algebraic sets , the dimensions of the cohomology groups also known as the betti numbers , determine qualitative information about the set , such as connectivity ( in the usual sense ) , number of holes and/or tunnels ( i.e. higher dimensional connectivity ) , its euler - poincar characteristic ( a discrete valuation with properties analogous to those of volume ) etc .    secondly , the reach of cohomology theory is not restricted to the continuous domain ( such as the study of algebraic varieties in @xmath86 or semi - algebraic sets in @xmath87 ) . as a consequence of a series of astonishing theorems ( conjectured by andre weil @xcite and proved by deligne @xcite , dwork @xcite et al . ) , it turns out that the number of solutions of systems of polynomial equations over a finite field , @xmath88 , in algebraic extensions of @xmath88 , is governed by the dimensions of certain ( appropriately defined ) cohomology groups of the associated variety ( see below ) . in this way , cohomology theory plays analogous roles in the discrete and continuous settings .    finally",
    ", the algorithmic problem of computing the cohomology groups of semi - algebraic sets is important from the viewpoint of computational complexity theory because of the following .",
    "it is easily seen that the classical np - complete problem in discrete complexity theory , the boolean satisfiability problem , is polynomial time equivalent to the problem of deciding whether a given system of polynomial equations in many variables over a finite field ( say @xmath89 ) has a solution .",
    "the real ( as well as the complex ) analogue of this problem has been proved to be np - complete in the real ( resp .",
    "complex ) version of turing machines , namely the blum - shub - smale machine ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the algebraic variety defined by a system of polynomial equations clearly has further structure apart from being merely empty or non - empty as a set . in the discrete case",
    ", we might want to count the number of solutions  and this turns out to be a @xmath71p - complete problem .",
    "recently , a @xmath90-completeness theory has been proposed for the bss model as well @xcite  and the natural @xmath71p complete problem in this context is computing the euler - poincar characteristic of a given variety ( the euler - poincar characteristic being a discrete valuation is the `` right '' notion of cardinality for infinite sets in this context ) .",
    "if one is interested in more information about the variety , then in the discrete case one could ask to count the number of solutions of the given system of polynomials not just over the ground field @xmath88 , but in every algebraic extension , @xmath91 of the ground field .",
    "even though this appears to be an infinite sequence of numbers , its exponential generating function ( the so called zeta - function of the variety ) turns out to be a rational function ( conjectured by weil @xcite , and proved by dwork @xcite ) of the form , @xmath92 where each @xmath93 is a polynomial with coefficients in a field of characteristic @xmath94 , and the degrees of the polynomials @xmath95 are the dimensions of ( appropriately defined ) cohomology groups associated to the variety @xmath96 defined by the given system of equations . in the real and complex setting , the ordinary topological betti numbers are considered some of the most important computable invariants of varieties and carry important topological information . thus , the algorithmic problem of computing betti numbers of constructible sets or varieties , is a natural extension of some of the basic problems appearing in computational complexity theory ",
    "namely deciding whether a given system of polynomial equation is satisfiable , and counting the number of solutions .",
    "this is true in both the discrete and continuous settings . even though , in this survey we concentrate on the latter , some of the techniques developed in this context conceivably have applications in the discrete case as well .",
    "also note that , by considering a complex variety @xmath97 as a real semi - algebraic set in @xmath98 , all results discussed in this survey extend directly ( with the same asymptotic complexity bounds ) to the corresponding problems ( of computing the betti numbers ) for complex algebraic varieties , and more generally for constructible subsets of @xmath99 .",
    "in this section we list some of the recent progress on the algorithmic problem of determining the betti numbers of semi - algebraic sets .    * in @xcite , an algorithm with single exponential complexity",
    "is given for computing the first betti number of semi - algebraic sets ( see section [ sec : closedcase ] below ) .",
    "previously , only the zero - th betti number ( i.e. the number of connected components ) could be computed in single exponential time .",
    "another important result contained in this paper is the homotopy equivalence between an arbitrary semi - algebraic set , and a closed and bounded one ( which is defined using infinitesimal perturbations of the polynomials defining the original set ) obtained by a construction due to gabrielov and vorobjov @xcite .",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that these sets are homotopy equivalent .",
