    "the existence of a nonzero cosmological constant , @xmath8 , would have profound significance for our understanding of the universe and its physics ( @xcite ) .",
    "the expansion history and geometry of the universe , as described by the freedman - roberston - walker ( frw ) solution , are completely determined given the density parameter , @xmath9 , and the cosmological parameter , @xmath10 .",
    "knowledge of @xmath11 $ ] is also of practical concern to interpret the physical properties of objects at large redshifts .",
    "the geometrical effects of the cosmological parameters are the basis of a number of classical tests of the world model .",
    "these include the redshift dependence of galaxy numbers , sizes or luminosities ( @xcite ) .",
    "the success of any of these tests is in large part dependent on the degree to which the evolution of the intrinsic properties of galaxies is understood so that those effects can removed to leave the cosmological variation of interest ( @xcite ) .",
    "the number count magnitude relation has long been taken as a hint that the @xmath12 model might not be correct , but this remains locked in the controversies of galaxy formation (  @xcite ) .",
    "although both the observational and theoretical understanding of galaxy evolution is advancing rapidly the fundamental degeneracy between galaxy evolution measurements and the cosmological parameters means that to derive a reliable empirical model requires additional information .",
    "there are a number of alternate approaches designed to establish observational constraints on the value of @xmath1 .",
    "one geometrical test is to compare the redshift and angular extensions of some physically understood shape at a large redshift , such as the quasar - quasar correlation function ( @xcite ) .",
    "the optical depth for multiple gravitational images of distant quasars increases rapidly with positive values of @xmath1 .",
    "the relatively low frequency of split images argues that @xmath13 ( @xcite ) . the high precision of photometry coupled with the growing understanding of supernovae , particularly those of type ia ( @xcite ) , allows the classical magnitude - redshift test to be implemented . with sufficient data over a large redshift range ( @xcite ) both the @xmath4 values can be measured . of particular note",
    "is the `` first doppler peak '' in the angular fluctuation spectrum of the cosmic background radiation which is a measurement over the largest possible path length of the geometry of the universe (  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the cosmological parameters are of sufficient importance that they will be measured with a variety of independent methods to establish their values with confidence , understand the astrophysics of the objects , and , to some degree test the frw model itself .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to note a variant of the classical volume - redshift test which breaks the cosmology - galaxy evolution degeneracy of the volume - redshift relation .",
    "that is , the co - moving mass density , which is an invariant at low redshift in all conventional cosmologies , is equal to the product of the total mass - to - light ratio , @xmath5 , with the field luminosity density , @xmath14 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the virialized systems can range from rich clusters to small groups of galaxies .",
    "virialized systems have the considerable benefit that their mass profiles can be inferred from dynamical techniques , independent of the distribution of the galaxies .",
    "furthermore dynamical mass measurements are distance independent ( other than the cosmological factors of interest ) with no corrections required to compare masses at different redshifts .    the following section briefly reviews the volume - redshift relation in the frw models .",
    "the relations are expanded to first order to illustrate the parameter dependencies and their degeneracy in the luminosity function .",
    "the mass - density constraint is introduced and the redshift dependence of the apparent @xmath15 , which is a function of the true @xmath4 , is shown in section 3 . in section 4 the random errors and data requirements of practical measurements",
    "are evaluated , concluding that a high precision measurement is primarily a matter of assembling the appropriate datasets , which is likely to be done anyway for a variety of other purposes .",
    "the co - moving distance , @xmath16 , to an object at redshift @xmath17 in an frw metric is found by integrating radially outward along the null geodesic , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the expansion factor and @xmath20 ( which is positive in this metric for an open , negatively curved , universe ) .",
    "the integral is rewritten in terms of the observable redshift using the cosmological equation @xmath21 , where @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( following the notation of peebles 1993 ) .",
    "the resulting co - moving distance is , @xmath24 .",
    "\\label{eq : rco}\\ ] ] the function sinn@xmath25 is @xmath26 for @xmath27 , @xmath28 for @xmath29 , and @xmath30 for @xmath31 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the co - moving volume element per @xmath32 and per steradian is @xmath33 , which with the local hubble law , @xmath34 , becomes , @xmath35    it is useful to note the first order expansions ( relative to a euclidean background ) of the co - moving distance , @xmath36 \\label{eq : arco}\\ ] ] and the co - moving volume element , @xmath37 .",
    "\\label{eq : avol}\\ ] ] the low redshift deceleration parameter is @xmath38 and can be used to simplify these first order expansions .",
    "there are several noteworthy points to take from these expressions .",
    "first , the volume - redshift relation has a sensitivity to the @xmath4 parameters that is twice of the magnitude - redshift , @xmath39 , relation .",
    "second , the dependence on the cosmological parameters of the distance and the volume element is identical , meaning that luminosity evolution and geometry ( or density evolution ) are degenerate at this order ( which remains approximately true over a wide range of redshifts ) .",
    "furthermore the test requires a comparison of objects at different redshifts .",
    "this generally requires an absolute comparison of fully calibrated quantities , along with all their selection effects .",
    "here we propose a test which is completely differential in the observational quantities : galaxies are only compared to one another at the same redshift and only redshift independent quantities ( except for the cosmological parameters of interest ) are compared at different redshifts .",
    "the co - moving mass density of the universe is an invariant for conventional cosmologies .",
    "one estimator of the mass density is through oort s method , @xmath41 , where @xmath5 is the total mass - to - light ratio of the universe and @xmath42 is the average field luminosity per unit volume . in the interval",
    "@xmath43 $ ] and solid angle @xmath44 , @xmath45 where the @xmath46 are the observed fluxes of the field galaxies in this volume .",
    "the virial mass , or any other dynamical estimator of the gravitational mass ( including the mean lensing gravitational shear within an aperture , @xcite ) , is of the form @xmath47 .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 is the angular scale radius of the cluster , such as either the classical pointwise virial radius estimator or a ringwise estimator ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total cluster luminosity is @xmath49 , where the sum adds the fluxes of the galaxies in the redshift and angular range that define the cluster , and is limited at the same @xmath46 or absolute luminosity as the field galaxies .",
    "the apparent density parameter is then , @xmath50      { h_0\\over { c\\rho_c}}{e(z,{\\bf \\omega^i})\\over       r(z,{\\bf \\omega^i})},\\ ] ] where @xmath51 are some convenient , but not necessarily correct , values used to calculate the relation .",
    "note that all the observational information is contained between the square brackets .",
    "if we assume @xmath52 , @xmath53 , the resulting effective @xmath15 is then , to first order , @xmath54 .",
    "\\label{eq : ao}\\ ] ] the function @xmath15 has a zero point which gives @xmath0 and a redshift dependence @xmath55 , assuming that the initial value , @xmath56 , is close to the true @xmath0 .",
    "this redshift dependence is 25% less sensitive to @xmath1 than the volume - redshift test .",
    "the general behavior of @xmath15 is shown in figure  [ fig : lamm ] .",
    "the plotted lines assume that the we calculated the masses and luminosities using @xmath57 and @xmath53 . for this choice of @xmath58",
    "the @xmath15 are functions of the true @xmath4 as , @xmath59 it is clear from this plot that the expected variation of this quantity between redshift zero and unity if sufficient to extract both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , the flat , @xmath60 , models have a distinctly different behavior than open models , for low values of @xmath0 .",
    "a practical implementation depends on having sufficient data that the random errors in the result are reduced to the desired level .",
    "the data must also allow for checks for systematic errors , notably differential evolution between clustered and field galaxies and whether clustered systems have any segregation between their luminosity and their mass distributions .",
    "in the following analysis we will consider data which uniformly cover the zero to unity redshift range , which is nearly optimal for the application of this test .",
    "a smaller redshift range does not give much leverage for the redshift dependence of @xmath15 which is essential for @xmath1 measurement .",
    "on the other hand , pushing the redshift range beyond redshift unity is quite difficult , since many of the spectral features used to measure accurate velocities , in particular the h+k lines and the 4000  break move out of the region accessible to high efficiency optical spectrographs .",
    "the random errors in estimating the @xmath5 ratio of a single virialized cluster are straightforward to evaluate . for the dynamical estimator of the form given above",
    "we need to estimate @xmath61 , @xmath48 and @xmath62 .",
    "if the errors are uncorrelated then the fractional error of a single cluster will be approximately @xmath63 .",
    "this expectation is borne out quite accurately in available data ( @xcite ) in which @xmath64 varies from about 25 to nearly 200 .",
    "once @xmath64 becomes much larger than 100 the statistical error continues to decline in the expected manner but the total error is dominated by projection effects and the internal substructure of the cluster . furthermore at about a magnitude below @xmath65 in the cluster the field galaxies begin to overwhelm the cluster galaxies .",
    "when these limits are encountered , it is better to spread the observations over more clusters rather than continuing to observe the same cluster .",
    "this is doubly true since more velocities usually require observing more deeply into the luminosity function where the fraction of the galaxies observed that are in the cluster , as opposed to the field , is an ever declining fraction . in summary",
    ", it is readily feasible to obtain @xmath5 values of individual clusters accurate to 25% , which formally requires 96 cluster members distributed over the face of the cluster .",
    "this is only practical for very rich clusters of galaxies .",
    "the number of clusters required for a confident measurement of @xmath1 is easily evaluated with monte carlo simulations of the sample properties .",
    "figure  [ fig : chilf ] shows the results of 1000 simulations of a sample of 20 clusters that are randomly but uniformly distributed over the @xmath66 interval .",
    "the cosmology used to generate the distribution has @xmath67 $ ] whereas the @xmath15 are calculated assuming @xmath68 $ ] .",
    "the @xmath69 confidence range is @xmath70 , irrespective of @xmath0 .",
    "the 99% confidence interval is @xmath71 , and many of the extreme values result primarily from unusually poor random distributions in redshift , which could be readily avoided in real observations .    to increase the precision of the result requires a larger cluster sample .",
    "one hundred clusters , with the same redshift and error distribution as above , can reduce the error in @xmath1 to a 7% @xmath69 error .",
    "groups found in a field survey can also be used , however , in that case the errors in @xmath5 for a single group are quite large",
    ". an efficient use of the data will be to average the groups together to build up pseudo - clusters of about 500 - 1000 galaxies which decreases the substructure and projection effects to a level where the profiles of galaxy density and mass can be checked for variation with redshift as well as the changes in galaxy population with redshift .",
    "since between 1/10 and 1/3 of galaxies are in field groups this implies that a field survey of about 20,000 galaxies is in hand . in either case",
    ", these surveys are easily feasible with existing instrumentation and will become easier with new facilities .",
    "if there was no differential evolution between the galaxies used to estimate @xmath5 and the average over the universe , then luminosity and density evolution would have no impact on our measurement of @xmath15 .",
    "the virialized systems that will be used range from groups , which contain galaxies quite similar to field galaxies , to rich clusters , which feature far more e and s0 galaxies , having redder colors , than the field galaxy population . over the @xmath72 redshift range under discussion all low redshift galaxies ( of high surface brightness ) have a parent ( or possibly several ) at higher redshift hence the accounting the accounting for mass and luminosity evolution is not confused by completely new galaxies appearing in abundance . for both luminosity evolution and density evolution",
    "the most difficult parameter to determine is the characteristic luminosity , @xmath65 .",
    "color differences , which track luminosity evolution ( @xcite ) , can be measured to much higher precision .",
    "the pioneering work on faint galaxy evolution established that the brightest galaxies do not evolve much more than a minimal passive evolution of ( @xcite ) as expected for bright cluster galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "various observations continue to bear out the basic slow evolution situation ( @xcite ) in spite of the significant changes of both cluster and field populations at fainter absolute magnitudes ( @xcite ) .",
    "the complications of differential evolution can be greatly minimized by restricting the sample to galaxies more luminous than about @xmath73 mag .",
    "furthermore , by fully sampling the volume of the virialized cluster or group one obtains a sample of cluster galaxies that is closer to the field population , both in range of colors and morphologies , than the central e / s0 galaxy population .    for measurements involving the comparison of galaxies in rich clusters to the field there will be some differential evolution , which we parameterize as @xmath74 .",
    "as emphasized above , the @xmath75 are small compared to the evolution in the @xmath14 and @xmath62 themselves , for suitably chosen samples . the straightforward way to determine the @xmath75 is through fitting the luminosity functions , @xmath76 to cluster and field galaxies individually , then @xmath77 is the difference between @xmath78 in clusters and the field .",
    "it is important to note that the values of the @xmath78 will depend on the assumed @xmath4 , however the quantities are only used to find the difference in characteristic magnitudes at the same redshift .",
    "the @xmath75 have no @xmath4 dependence , being just flux ratios at a common redshift .",
    "the data gathered for the @xmath15 analysis will also be used to measure the luminosity function relative to the field galaxies .",
    "although one should strive to make this an absolute luminosity function with well defined sample criteria , its primary use is in comparing clustered galaxies to field galaxies so sample selection effects that are in common will make no difference to the difference between the two luminosity functions .",
    "the maximum likelihood technique of sandage , tammann & yahil ( 1972 ) .",
    "a dataset of 2000 absolute magnitudes is generated from a schechter luminosity function , @xmath79 . as a reasonable match to the available data @xmath80 mag , with @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "we assume that the data extend to @xmath84 mag , although the precise depth makes little difference providing it is 1 to 2 magnitudes below @xmath65 .",
    "the 68 , 90 and 99% error ellipses are shown for 3 parameter fits for @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 are shown in figure  [ fig : chilf ] . from this",
    "we conclude that the sample will allow a measurement of @xmath65 accurate to 0.1 mag and @xmath87 accurate to 0.2 mag per unit redshift .",
    "normally the field sample will be larger than the cluster sample , so the errors in measuring the same quantities in the field will be no larger .",
    "the error in estimating @xmath87 , will dominate the error in @xmath1 because it is more difficult to determine precisely and they are terms that are approximately linear in @xmath17 .",
    "however , for a 20 cluster , 100 galaxies per cluster survey ( plus the accompanying field galaxies ) we expect that the error in @xmath1 should be about @xmath88 of the error in @xmath87 .",
    "this is shown in fact to be borne out fairly accurately in the full nonlinear result , shown in figure  [ fig : lame ] .",
    "differential merging has no effect on the measurement of the cluster luminosity , @xmath62 , or the field luminosity density , @xmath14 , unless accompanied by star formation .",
    "measurements of the [ oii ] line in high luminosity cluster and field galaxies ( @xcite ) find that the star formation in the field adds little mass to these galaxies , that there is no increase in star formation upon cluster entry , and confirms the well known suppression of star formation in clusters . on the other hand",
    ", merging will increase the @xmath65 in a way that could be mistaken for luminosity evolution .",
    "the colors and morphological types of galaxies , both suitably adjusted for fading in a cluster , can test for luminosity evolution as opposed to merging .",
    "the current measurements of the radial change from cluster center to pure field of the mean luminosity and color suggest that relatively little merging of field galaxies relative to cluster galaxies occurs .",
    "the dominant effect is that galaxies largely cease forming stars and fade a few tenths of a magnitude when they enter the cluster ( @xcite ) .",
    "the accuracy to which differential luminosity evolution and differential merging can be determined in a multi - color survey is mainly the precision to which the characteristic @xmath65 can be measured , which we have taken as our error estimate .",
    "the differential luminosity evolution is already known to be no more than half of the expected variation of @xmath15 ( if the universe is flat ) .",
    "hence , the galaxy sample will be sufficient to increase the precision of the differential evolution measurement to allow confident @xmath1 estimation .",
    "the classical volume - redshift test , which depends upon an absolute comparison of galaxy numbers or luminosities at different redshifts , can be modified to create a much more reliable , completely differential , test .",
    "the extra ingredient is to combine quantities which together give the mean co - moving mass density of the universe , which is a conserved quantity .",
    "this benefit comes at the modest cost of a 25% reduction in @xmath1 sensitivity .",
    "monte carlo simulations show that a sample of 2000 cluster galaxies and a comparable field sample will be able to tightly constrain the differential evolution between cluster and field and will measure @xmath1 to a precision of about 25% .",
    "moreover , groups of galaxies found within a large field survey will serve the same purpose and provide a second avenue to address differential evolution between cluster and field .",
    "differential evolution between clustered and field galaxies will be addressed using multi - color photometry and imaging . in the longer term , a survey of 100 or so rich clusters will increase the precision of the geometry measurement to about 7% .",
    "such data can also give extremely precise measurements of the evolution of the sample galaxies , although these should not be taken as absolute evolutionary measurements unless care is taken to avoid redshift dependent selection effects .",
