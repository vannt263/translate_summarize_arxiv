    "the modification of the hadron properties and interactions in baryon environment is one of the important topics of contemporary strong interaction physics .",
    "such a modification has been predicted within various theoretical approaches such as qcd sum rules @xcite , chiral dynamics @xcite , relativistic mean - field @xcite and quark - meson coupling models @xcite .",
    "embedding a hadron in nuclear matter can cause a change of its mass and width .",
    "an evidence for a decrease of the @xmath2 meson in - medium mass in heavy - ion collisions was obtained by the ceres collaboration at cern @xcite and later indicated by the star experiment at rhic @xcite .",
    "very recently , the cbelsa / taps collaboration reported on the first observation of sizable lowering of the @xmath3 meson mass at normal nuclear matter density in the @xmath4 reaction @xcite .",
    "the interaction of a hadron in nuclear medium is expected to be also modified leading , in particular , to change of its absorption in nucleus .",
    "the results of recent experiment @xcite on the @xmath5 meson photo - production from different nuclei evidence for significant enhancement of the @xmath5 @xmath6 nucleon cross section in the nuclear environment .",
    "the study of the propagation of antiprotons in nuclear matter can provide the valuable information on the in - medium modification of the @xmath7 @xmath6 nucleon interaction .",
    "anomalous weak absorption of the antiprotons produced in proton - nucleus collisions had been first observed in @xcite and then was confirmed in @xcite .",
    "the inclusive and semi - inclusive @xmath7 production in @xmath8be , @xmath8cu and @xmath8au interactions was studied at ags energies of 12.3 and 17.5 gev @xcite .",
    "the analysis within the glauber - type multiple scattering model performed in @xcite shown that the @xmath7 absorption cross section is at least a factor of 5 smaller than the free @xmath9 annihilation cross section .",
    "several mechanisms for the decreased @xmath7 absorption have been proposed including finite antiproton formation time @xcite ,  shielding  of the absorption process @xcite , strong reduction of the phase space available for annihilation due to drop of in - medium @xmath7 and nucleon masses @xcite , the formation of @xmath10 bound state @xcite , which was apparently observed in @xcite .",
    "all of such arguments manifest themselves as a suppression of the antiproton annihilation with nuclear nucleons .",
    "proton - nucleus collisions provide a suitable tool for disentangling of the suggested theoretical schemes and elucidating the dynamics of in - medium antiproton production and absorption in nuclear environment . using the nuclei as an absorbers",
    "has an advantage to have a well defined , nearly static density profile . in this work we present the analysis of inclusive antiproton production in proton - nucleus collisions aimed at the evaluation of the effective antiproton - nucleon cross section in nuclear matter and the imaginary part of the @xmath7 - nuclear potential .",
    "recently , the differential cross sections for antiproton production on be , al , cu and ta targets were measured at 10 gev itep synchrotron @xcite .",
    "the data were taken at initial kinetic proton energies of 5.5 , 7.2 and 9.2 gev .",
    "secondary antiprotons in the momentum range @xmath11 gev / c were detected at @xmath12 ( lab ) .",
    "for the evaluation of the antiproton absorption in nuclear matter we use the subset of the experimental data which includes 20 values of the measured differential cross sections on cu and ta targets at projectile energies of @xmath13 and @xmath14 gev . the reasons for that are the following .",
    "first , evidently that the absorption effect is most important for middle and heavy nuclei .",
    "second , it is known that the hadron production in proton - induced reactions at near threshold energies can be described as a superposition of individual collisions of the projectile protons and secondary pions with target nucleons , participating in the fermi motion . in such a case",
    "the elementary hadron production can be described by the phase space calculations normalized by the corresponding total cross sections .",
    "the experimental information about the behavior of the total cross sections for antiproton production in the elementary @xmath15 and @xmath16 collisions is available at the excess of collision energy @xmath17  gev above the corresponding thresholds .",
    "the main contribution to the cross section for antiproton production on nuclei comes from the range of @xmath18 gev at initial proton energy of @xmath13 gev and from @xmath19 gev at @xmath14 gev which are close to the experimentally studied range of @xmath20 .",
    "that ensures the rather reliable using of the elementary @xmath7 production cross sections from @xcite in our calculations of antiproton creation on nuclei at beam energies of @xmath13 and @xmath14 gev .",
    "third , according to the study @xcite , the influence of the real part of the @xmath7-nuclear optical potential on the subthreshold antiproton production in @xmath21 collisions diminishes gradually with increasing bombarding energy and becomes insignificant already at threshold energy of 5.6 gev .",
    "finally , at above threshold energies the internal nucleon momentum distribution can be safely used instead of the nucleon spectral function which simplifies the calculations of @xmath7 production in pa - reactions .",
    "the obtained data were analyzed in the framework of the folding model [ see  @xcite for details ] accounting for the elementary processes which have the lowest free production thresholds .",
    "in addition to the direct antiproton creation via the first chance inelastic proton - nucleon collision , @xmath22 , it is also possible to produce @xmath7 in two - step cascade process @xmath23 followed by @xmath24 . although the threshold for the latter is lower , only high momentum pions contribute to the cross section .",
    "the invariant inclusive cross section for the production on nucleus with atomic mass a at small laboratory angles an antiproton with the total energy @xmath25 and momentum @xmath26 via the direct reaction channel can be represented as follows :    @xmath27    the expression in the first braces describes the distortion of the incident proton and the absorption of the outgoing antiproton in its way out of nucleus . here",
    "@xmath28 and @xmath29 stand for the impact parameter and the @xmath30component of the coordinate along the beam axis , respectively .",
    "we use @xmath31 = 30 mb for both considered projectile proton energies which is assumed to be the same for the pp- and pn - collisions . in eq .",
    "(  [ eq : a ] ) @xmath32 stands for the effective in - medium antiproton - nucleon cross section .",
    "any difference between the antiproton absorption on nuclear protons and neutrons is disregarded .    in the calculation of @xmath7 production on cu and ta targets we use for the density @xmath33 the two - parameter fermi distribution normalized to unity with parameters r=4.20 fm ( cu ) , r=6.16 fm ( ta ) , a=0.55 fm for both nuclei and a nuclear saturation density @xmath34=@xmath35  @xmath36 .",
    "the expression in the second braces connects the cross section for @xmath7 production in the collision of incident proton with off - shell struck target nucleon to the elementary on - shell cross section .",
    "the total energy @xmath37 of the struck nucleon is related to its momentum @xmath38 as follows : @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 stand for free nucleon mass and the mass of the recoiling target nucleus in its ground state , respectively .",
    "the nucleon binding energy @xmath42 is taken equal to 6 mev .",
    "the invariant collision energy squared is read : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are total energy and momentum of the projectile proton , respectively .",

    "the second term in the square brackets represents the high momentum component of the internal nucleon momentum distributions @xmath52 which plays a minor role at considered incident proton energies of 7.2 and 9.2 gev .",
    "as was above mentioned , in our approach the invariant inclusive cross section for antiproton production in the elementary @xmath53 reaction has been described by the four - body phase space calculations normalized to the corresponding total cross section : @xmath54 here @xmath55 and @xmath56 are three - body and four - body phase spaces of the reaction @xmath57 , while @xmath58 denotes the invariant energy squared of the not detectable three - nucleon system .",
