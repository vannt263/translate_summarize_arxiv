    "the study of the efficiency of thermal engines was one of the problems driving the development of thermodynamics @xcite .",

    "similarly , the whole system acts as a refrigerator if as a result of injecting some power @xmath6 in the system , some heat @xmath5 is extracted from the cold bath . in the case of engines ,",
    "a performance measure is given by the efficiency , defined as @xmath8 which is bounded by the carnot efficiency @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "the carnot efficiency is only reached in idealized models at vanishing rates , and from a practical point of view a more interesting problem is the efficiency of both classical @xcite and quantum @xcite engines at maximum power output .",
    "in particular , the efficiency at maximum power of an optimized thermal engine in the endoreversible limit ( where the only irreversible contribution is due to finite rate heat transfer effects ) is given by the curzon - ahlborn expression @xcite @xmath11 although @xmath12 is neither an upper or lower bound for the efficiency of a general system , it describes reasonably well the behavior of actual thermal engines working with bath temperatures corresponding to low @xmath9 .",
    "the reason of this success can be explained by considering the taylor expansion @xmath13 the first term has been shown to be an upper bound for the efficiency at maximum power output in the linear response of engines : low @xmath9 implies @xmath14 , the stationary state reached by the engine is close to thermal equilibrium , and hence the tools of linear thermodynamics can be successfully applied @xcite .",

    "we motivate our study using a simple quantum model , the three - level maser . in this model the larger normalized optimal performances , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , are reached in the regime of low carnot efficiency and low carnot cop respectively , together with small thermodynamic forces",

    "we extend this analysis to engines and discuss how the dependence of the thermodynamic flux on the forces determines the optimal performances as functions of the carnot efficiency and cop .",
