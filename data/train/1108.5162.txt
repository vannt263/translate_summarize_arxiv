    "in 2005 , the first author of this paper was contentedly continuing his investigations into the the contents of neutron - capture elements in very metal - poor stars ( , sneden  2003 ; lawler  2004 ) . at the same time , the second author was beginning graduate study , hoping to expand on her initial research into pulsating subdwarf b stars ( , for  2006 ) .",
    "neither one paid much attention to clear signals that the third author was re - kindling his interest in the research that had dominated his early career ( , preston 1959 ) : rr  lyr variable stars .",
    "but a special project a few years ago on the peculiar chemical composition of a single , accidentally - rediscovered very metal - poor rr  lyr has expanded into a large - scale general investigation on the chemistry of the galactic rr  lyr population . in this effort",
    ", the first two authors have been the happy recipients of the data acquisition , the spectrum analyses , the variable star insights , and the overall enthusiasm for this work by the third author .    in this contribution we first will review the unusual chemical composition of ty  gru , the star that started us down this research path . as part of the ty  gru discussion we will comment on our continued failure to detect orbital motion of ty  gru around an agb relic presumed to be the origin of its abundance anomalies .",
    "then we will describe the recently - completed detailed investigation into the atmospheric parameters and abundances of a sample of 10 intensively - observed rrab stars .",
    "finally , we will sketch new initiatives that we are pursuing in contrasting the spectra of rrc with rrab variables , and in utilizing a much larger sample of rrab spectra gathered for the galactic structure studies by juna kollmeier and her colleagues .",
    "a high - resolution spectroscopic survey ( preston  2006a ) of metal - poor red horizontal branch ( rhb ) stars discovered in the hk survey ( beers , preston , & shectman 1992 ) included the star cs  22881 - 071 .",
    "velocity shifts in the two initial observations of this star quickly led to recognition that it was the previously identified rrab variable star ty  gru .",
    "this star was severed from the general rhb survey , and its subsequent analysis was published in a separate study ( preston  2006b ) .    we became interested in ty  gru after noticing that several features of neutron - capture elements ( , z  @xmath0  30 ) were anomalously strong compared to rhb stars with similar atmospheric parameters . in figure  [ tygruf1 ] we show a small spectral region in the blue of ty  gru and some comparison stars .",
    "a practiced eye can see the main spectroscopic results without any detailed analysis : * [ 1 ] * all of the  features are enhanced compared to those of an ordinary warm rhb star like cs  22186 - 005 ; * [ 2 ] * the relative strengths of the and lines in ty  gru are larger than those of ; * [ 3 ] * the ty  gru  line strength pattern is consistent with that of cs  29497 - 030 , which exhibits products of slow  synthesis ( the ) but is incompatible with that of cs  22886 - 043 , which has a distinct abundance signature of rapid  synthesis ( the ) .",
    "our detailed abundance analysis , involving 10 elements representing all observable atomic   mass / number domains , demonstrated that the ty  gru pattern is a near - perfect match to the abundance patterns of other very metal - poor , -rich stars .",
    "we illustrate this agreement in figure  [ tygruf9 ] .",
    "while the overall amount of  abundance excess is less in ty  gru than in cs  29497 - 030 ( ivans  2005 ) and cs  31062 - 050 ( johnson & bolte 2004 ) , the agreement in abundance distribution would be near - perfect if the ty  gru numbers were to be renormalized to match , say , the ba or la abundances of one of the comparison stars . in this figure , note especially the large overabundances of all  elements ( @xmath10.3  @xmath2 [ element / fe ]  @xmath2 @xmath12.1 ) ; the decline in relative overabundances among the rare - earth elements as atomic number increases from z  = 56 to 70 ; and finally the enormous overabundance of pb , the penultimate stable element .",
    "preston  ( 2006b ) also derived large carbon overabundances in ty  gru .",
    "these are all unmistakable signatures of  synthesis in low - metallicity he - fusion zones of highly evolved ( agb ) stars ( , gallino  1998 ; goriely & mowlavi 2001 ) .",
    "the ty  gru investigation featured an observational / analytical advance in rr  lyr spectroscopy which has proven to be important in our recent work .",
    "much of the previous rr  lyr abundance work ( , clementini  1995 ; lambert  1996 ) was relatively photon - starved and consequently employed few spectra .",
    "these data were generally obtained at one mean phase position with substantial phase smearing .",
    "thanks to the availability of substantial amounts of time on large telescopes equipped with efficient echelle spectrographs , preston  ( 2006b ) were able to obtain 82 high - resolution spectra in maximum integration times of about 15 minutes , which correspond to a pulsational phase interval of @xmath3  = 0.02 .",
    "this procedure produced individual spectra of relatively low signal - to - noise ( s / n ) , but the repeatability of rr  lyr spectroscopic variations allowed us to improve s / n by addition several spectra obtained at similar phases , as we illustrate in figure  [ tygruf6a ] .",
    "the phase for the ty  gru abundance analysis , @xmath4  @xmath5 0.8 , was chosen to be near light minimum in the belief that this would be the optimal phase ( most stable photospheric conditions ) .",
    "although this had been a popular choice in past rr  lyr studies , our subsequent work has forced a re - evaluation ; see  [ biqingwork ] .",
    "ty  gru is the first rr  lyr star to be found with large carbon and  abundance enhancements .",
    "nearly all metal - poor stars with these abundance characteristics are proven or suspected members of binary star systems with unseen secondary companions ( , mcclure 1997 ; preston & sneden 2001 ; lucatello  2005 ) .",
    "this is the simplest explanation for the ty  gru abundances , but observational proof of the idea has been difficult to obtain .",
    "preston  ( 2006b ) were unable to detect any secular drift in the the ty  gru systemic radial velocities that might be indicative of wide - binary orbital motion . at that time however only two years of spectra contributed to the radial velocity information . in subsequent years",
    "more spectra have been gathered , and preston s ( 2011 ) figure  1 displays the expanded velocity set .",
    "even more recent ty  gru spectra leads to one more update which we show in figure  [ tygruvel ] .",
    "ty gru is a blazhko star which exhibits a modest variation of radial velocity amplitude in a period of about 68 days as illustrated in figures  10 and 11 of preston  ( 2006b ) .",
    "the blazhko phenomenon produces a change in velocity amplitude but not in the systemic velocity . in figure  [ tygruvel ]",
    "we see such amplitude variations , but the minimum and maximum radial velocities in each observing season lie within the dashed horizontal lines in the figure ; they do not appear to have shifted up or down during the past seven years .",
    "this lack of secular velocity drift for ty  gru can be used to place a constraint on the period of orbital motion .",
    "we adopt a mass for ty  gru of m  =  0.68m@xmath6 , a typical value for rr  lyr stars ( castellani , castellani , & cassisi 2005 ) , and assume a mass for a putative white - dwarf companion of m  @xmath7  0.6m@xmath6 . from the observed dispersions in upper and lower bounds of the radial velocities shown in figure  [ tygruvel ] we believe that we could detect a change in systemic velocity of 5  km  s@xmath8 during the past 2000 days ( half orbital period ) had it occurred .",
    "the circular velocities for our adopted masses and orbital periods of 4000 and 8000 days are 6.8  km  s@xmath8 and 5.4  km  s@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "these periods bracket the longest orbital periods ( 5324  d and 6489  d ) that have been found for marginally detectable ba / ch giants ( boffin & zacs 1994 ) . from the above considerations we argue that the orbital period of the putative ty gru binary must be substantially greater than 4000 d. there must be a longest period ( largest binary separation ) for which wind accretion from an agb companion will fail to produce the observable pollution of the ty gru envelope .",
    "thus , the search for orbital motion of ty gru has interesting astrophysical implications .",
    "we note , finally , that preston & sneden ( 2001 ) , and preston ( 2009b ) have reported similar difficulty in the detection of orbital motion in several main sequence carbon stars .",
    "a larger - scale investigation of rr  lyr was conceived in part to understand if possible binary mass transfer from a retired compact - star companion had created a unique evolutionary hb status for ty  gru ( preston 2011 ) .",
    "a sample of 10 rrab stars with photometric properties similar to ty  gru were intensively observed with the las campanas du  pont telescope and its echelle spectrograph ; extant spectra of ty  gru were added in .",
    "the resulting data set consists of over 2300 short - integration spectra , about 200 spectra / star , covering the spectral range 3500    @xmath9 @xmath10  @xmath9 9000   , with resolving power @xmath11  @xmath5 27,000 , and typical s / n of 20 in the blue .",
    "all phase intervals of all program stars have been sampled with multiple spectra .",
    "this rich database can be mined to address a variety of questions about rr  lyr atmospheric physics , and already preston ( 2009a ) has discovered unexpected helium emission lines at some phases in all of the stars .",
    "we also have used these spectra to refine their velocity information and pulsational ephemerides ( for , preston , & sneden 2011a ) .    here",
    "we outline just a few aspects of our derivation of @xmath12 parameters , , and , overall [ fe / h ] metallicities , and relative abundance ratios [ x / fe ] for our rrab sample .",
    "detailed results are described in for , sneden , & preston ( 2011b ) .",
    "* temperature , gravity , and microturbulence vary in similar and predictable ways throughout the pulsational cycles in all of our rrab sample .",
    "as one example , in figure  [ rvoct1 ] we show the variations in these quantities in program star rv  oct .",
    "the phase - dependent atmospheric parameters are for a particular rrab variable , but pulsational phases changes are qualitatively always the same in our program stars ( and most likely in all `` normal '' rrab stars as well ) . * the optimal phase for abundance studies , defined as that phase at which the metal absorption lines are sharpest and most symmetric , occurs at @xmath4  @xmath5 0.35 , not at the mimimum light phase of @xmath4  @xmath5 0.75 .",
    "future rr  lyr chemical composition studies should concentrate on @xmath4  @xmath5 0.35 if possible . * in spite of  changes of more than 1000  k and changes of more than 1  dex during each pulsational cycle , the [ fe / h ] metallicities displayed in figure  [ rvoct2 ] appear to be essentially invariant to within the uncertainties of an individual abundance determination , over the entire rv  oct pulsational cycle .",
    "this statement can be applied to our whole sample of rrab stars , suggesting that reliable metallicities can be determined at any rr  lyr phase , as long as good estimates of , , and  can also be extracted from the spectra . *",
    "just as importantly , nearly all derived relative abundance ratios are insensitive to pulsational phase , and are mostly in accord with expectations based on abundance ratios for other halo - star evolutionary groups . in figure  [ rvoct2 ]",
    "we show variations of eight light - element abundance ratios , and one can easily divide the confidence levels of claimed phase invariance into excellent ( , , ) , probable ( , ) , uneasy ( , ) and unproven ( ) .",
    "* the elements si and ca are official members of the light @xmath13-element group , whose major isotopes are multiples of helium nuclei .",
    "element ti has a courtesy membership in the @xmath13 group , because while its major isotope @xmath14ti is not an aggregate of @xmath13 particles , its abundance in most metal - poor stars mimics those of the true @xmath13 elements .",
    "we find the abundance ratios [ mg , si , ca , or ti / fe ]  @xmath5 + 0.5 , in qualitative agreement with the elevated @xmath13 abundances seen in other types of metal - poor stars ( , cayrel  2004 ) . * si abundances based on lines in the blue spectral region are known to be temperature - sensitive ( , preston  2006a , sneden & lawler 2008 ) . as one can see in figure  [ rvoct2 ] ,",
    "the addition of lines in rv  oct does little to alter the situation .",
    "happily however , on average both species support the notion of si overabundance in this and in the rest of our rrab sample .",
    "these comments only touch on the some of the for  ( 2011b ) results .",
    "please see that paper for extended comments on the above points , and for discussion of the relative abundances of heavier elements , the variation of microturbulent velocity with pulsational phase , the relationship between  and line full - width - half - maxima , and a new method to estimate rrab effective temperatures without extended analyses .",
    "most previous spectroscopic studies of horizontal - branch variables have focused on the rrab stars , the majority component of the rr  lyr population .",
    "much less attention has been paid to the rrc stars .",
    "the rrc stars present some observational challenges .",
    "they are relatively rare ( hence fainter on average ) , and they are hotter so their absorption lines are weaker at constant abundance .    we have begun a program to derive atmospheric parameters and elemental abundance ratios in a sample of field rrc variables .",
    "we employ the same du pont echelle configuration that was used to obtain the rrab spectra described above . in spite of the faintness of the targets we have obtained satisfactory data by co - adding individual spectra taken at similar phases . in figure  [ rrcspec2 ] we present a small spectral region in one of the rrc target stars .",
    "obviously the spectra of this star and a comparison rrab shown in this figure are not as good as that of an rhb star studied by preston  ( 2006a ) ; the smaller telescope and shorter spectroscopic exposure times result in lower s / n .",
    "however , one can clearly see all the major absorption features in the rrc spectra that are necessary to determine both overall metallicity and enough abundance ratios to be able to describe the chemical history of the rrc stars .",
    "note also from comparison of the top and middle spectra in figure  [ rrcspec2 ] that the fwhm ( macroturbulence ) of the rrc absorption lines is lower than that of the rrab star .",
    "analysis of the rrc spectra are underway .",
    "we have obtained preliminary estimates of the atmospheric parameters of one of the stars . to accomplish this",
    ", we began with the same fe input line list that was used by for  ( 2011b ) , then measured equivalent widths , and performed a standard atmospheric analysis . in figure  [ rrc ]",
    "we show the abundances of individual lines as functions of excitation energy , line strength , and wavelength .",
    "not shown in this figure are the abundances from lines .",
    "the derived model satisfied the usual spectroscopic criteria of no substantial trends of abundances with excitation potential , equivalent width , and wavelength , along with equality of the mean and abundances .",
    "the temperatures and gravities are consistent with general expectations for rrc variables .",
    "the derived metallicity , [ fe / h ]  @xmath15 log  @xmath16  @xmath17 log  @xmath18  = 5.7 @xmath17",
    "7.5 = @xmath171.8 , clearly indicates membership of this star in the galactic halo population .",
    "but most intriguingly , we derive  @xmath7 2.1  km  s@xmath8 , much smaller than typical values of rrab stars ( 3@xmath174  km  s@xmath8 ) .",
    "this points to absence of shock - wave disturbances in rrc atmospheres at the microscopic level .",
    "we also are participating in juna kollmeier s statistical parallax program .",
    "a major spectroscopic survey has been undertaken by kollmeier and her colleagues to derive radial velocities and abundances for more than 1000 rr  lyr stars .",
    "the principal goal of this project is to calibrate the fundamental distance scale using the rr  lyr as standard candles .",
    "the spectra being gathered for this project have relatively low s / n , of necessity .",
    "the spectra are more than adequate produce good radial velocities .",
    "abundance determinations pose more of a challenge .",
    "our part of the overall effort will be to derive metallicities and a limited set of abundance ratios .",
    "we are finding that that reliable metallicities can be obtained with spectra of very weak signal by using the `` multiplex '' advantage of the many fe - group element absorption features that are present in rr  lyr stars .",
    "we are employing techniques that are similar to those pioneered by carney  ( 1987 ) .",
    "we are initially concentrating on the 5000@xmath175400    spectral region ( as did carney ) which contains the b  lines and other strong spectral features . for detailed abundance ratios other spectral domains will need to be surveyed ( , the 4500    region which contains 4554   ) .",
    "observations for this program are underway .",
    "we are grateful for support from the u.s . national science foundation over many years , currently with grant ast  0908978 ."
