    "the processes of dust formation and mass loss in evolved giants and supergiants remains poorly understood despite its manifold and profound implications to the cycle of matter through stars and back into the ism .",
    "an extensive observational and phenomenological literature ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) bears witness to the barrage of astrophysical techniques applied to this problem , and progress has been considerable in many important areas .",
    "however , fundamental uncertainties remain over the mechanisms of elevation of material , chemical nucleation of the dust , and subsequent outflow and global properties of the wind . as an example of the gap in our understanding",
    ", there has been to date no self - consistent physical model of the atmosphere of an evolved o - rich giant which encompasses the upper regions including even the most important basic phenomena : non - grey radiative transfer , pulsation , shocks , convection , non - equilibrium dust formation and the molecular atmosphere .    from an observational perspective",
    ", progress has been hampered until now by the difficulties inherent in imaging material on size scales of a few au which encompass the photospheres themselves and the dust formation and acceleration regions .",
    "although modern long - baseline optical / ir interferometry is capable of accessing these scales , imaging is not straightforward as targets can be complex , deeply embedded and often asymmetric . in particular for many mira - type variables ,",
    "the relatively low surface - brightness material in the outflow can be very difficult to detect against the high luminosity stellar flux .",
    "the stellar photosphere and circumstellar dust shell are usually treated as completely separate regimes , as justified by the following simple argument . as a first approximation",
    ", one might consider that dust grains in an optically thin envelope are grey or nearly so , and exist in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field .",
    "furthermore , we can approximate the star as having a small angular extent , so that the mean intensity , @xmath0 at the dust condensation radius @xmath1 is equal to the luminosity of the central star @xmath2 divided by @xmath3 . in this case equation  [ eqndustgrey ] gives an estimate of the dust formation radius ( here @xmath4 the radius of the central star , @xmath5 the effective temperature of the star and @xmath6 the dust condensation temperature ) . given an effective temperature of 3000k and a dust condensation temperature of 1100k , the dust formation radius is 3.7 stellar radii , which means that the physics of the photosphere and the circumstellar environment could be considered well - separated . where dust is considered to be non - grey , but the dust formation radius still lies well - outside the photosphere , conservation of energy and radiative equilibrium gives equation  [ eqndustaway ] , where @xmath7 is the absorption coefficient of the dust and @xmath8 is the planck function in the form which gives power per unit area per steradian per unit wavelength",
    ". further discussion of these kinds of approximations can be found in @xcite .",
    "@xmath9    @xmath10    the absorption coefficients for dust around o - rich mira are often assumed to be those of `` dirty '' silicates @xcite .",
    "these silicates have optical constants very similar to amorphous olivine mg@xmath11fe@xmath12sio@xmath13 with @xmath14 @xcite , with the exception of the spectral range 2 - 8@xmath15 m , where inclusions such as solid fe are required to match observationally derived optical constants .",
    "olivine with @xmath14 can form only slightly closer to the star than grey dust . using",
    "the emitted flux from a 3000k effective temperature mira model from ireland et al .",
    "( 2004a ) ( the m09n model ) , the optical constants from @xcite and an assumed condensation temperature of 1100k , this olivine can form at a radius of 6.4 stellar radii : still a comfortable distance from the upper atmosphere of the star .    apart from the optical properties , the other factor governing grain survival at smaller radii is the sublimation temperature .",
    "the dust species often considered to be the first to form in higher effective temperature stars from semi - empirical considerations is corundum @xcite , al@xmath16o@xmath17 , which is stable at considerably higher temperatures than silicates @xcite .",
    "its formation radius for this same 3000k model star is 2.1 stellar radii , using the optical constants from @xcite and an assumed condensation temperature of 1400k .",
    "the multi - wavelength diameter measurements of six mira - like variables made by ireland et al .",
    "( 2004b ) show an increase in apparent diameter from 900 nm to 700 nm with a component which appears uncorrelated with the strength of tio bands .",
    "these observations are best explained by scattering from dust closer than a few stellar radii ( although molecular line blanketing makes quantitative interpretation difficult ) .",
    "the presence of extensive dust this close is , as discussed above , difficult to reconcile with the conventional wisdom on dust formation around agb stars .    despite the fact that the net polarisation arising from a spherically symmetric dust shell is zero ,",
    "it is possible to separate it from the unpolarised photosphere with a polarisation - sensitive high - resolution measurement . scattering from the dust shell",
    "will have a polarisation at any point with the e field in an azimuthal direction with respect to the stellar centre .",
    "this is due to the simple relationship that scattered light from small particles in the rayleigh limit is polarised orthogonal to the plane containing the source , scatterer and observer .",
    "if we now consider the response of a long - baseline interferometer which measures the fourier components ( called visibilities when total flux is normalised to unity ) of such an image , these will have different amplitudes and phases in different polarisations .",
    "for a partially - resolved circularly symmetric source , the linear polarisation with the e field parallel to the baseline of observation will have a lower amplitude and the same phase as the visibility measured using the polarisation perpendicular to the baseline .",
    "an attempt was made using this technique to detect scattering by free electrons around @xmath18 orionis using the long - baseline narrabri stellar intensity interferometer @xcite , but the instrument lacked the required sensitivity .",
    "here we report the first successful use of this technique on a long - baseline optical interferometer .",
    "the observational technique is described in the following section , while section  [ sectmodel ] gives the results and section  [ sectdiscuss ] a discussion and astrophysical interpretation .",
    "the sydney university stellar interferometer ( susi ) is a long baseline optical interferometer with presently operational baselines from 5 to 160 m ( further details can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "the observations presented here used 5 and 10 m baselines and a filter with central wavelength of 900 nm and full - width half - maximum 80 nm .",
    "this filter was chosen so as to minimise contamination from the strongest features caused by the tio molecule .",
    "it is in principle possible to measure visibilities at arbitrary polarisations through the use of quarter - wave plates and polarisers at arbitrary orientations . for a discussion of a general way to calibrate a long baseline interferometer for imaging in all stokes parameters ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "due to polarisation - dependent phase - shifts and mirror reflectivities over the many mirrors in the susi optical chain , arbitrary initial polarisation states are not well preserved .",
    "the measurements therefore are restricted to states with pure vertical and horizontal electric field orientation with respect to the optical path . while they will be attenuated",
    ", these states should not suffer mixing from any reflection with the exception of the initial reflection off the siderostat when observing away from the meridian .",
    "care was taken to only observe stellar targets when near the meridian .",
    "given susi s north - south baseline orientation , this observing strategy resulted in visibility measurements with the e field at all times being within 19 degrees of perpendicular ( @xmath19 ) or parallel ( @xmath20 ) to the baseline . for crucial observations where a direct comparison was made between the visibilities in these two polarisations ,",
    "data were restricted further to lie within 8 degrees of these orientations .    the beam combining system used for these observations consisted of a pupil - plane beam combiner feeding two avalanche photo - diode ( apd ) detectors . by repeatedly scanning the optical delay linearly through the white - light fringe position ,",
    "the light detected from each output of the combining beamsplitter is modulated at a frequency that depends on the scanning rate and the observing wavelength , with the fringe signals 180 degrees out of phase at the two outputs .",
    "a description of a similar system can be found in @xcite , and further details of the beam combining system used for these observations will be found in @xcite ( in preparation ) .",
    "although the two outputs are usually used differentially to reduce the effects of scintillation noise , it is possible to obtain an estimate for the fringe visibility from only one output , as in figure  [ figpowerspectra ] .",
    "the use of only one detector means that the bias in the power spectrum is not flat due to scintillation , and incorrect subtraction of this bias becomes an additional error source for low @xmath21 .",
    "the observational strategy employed consisted of two separate parts : the first aimed at measuring @xmath19 and @xmath20 separately , while the second measured the ratio @xmath22 .",
    "these are described in turn below .",
    "firstly , polarisers were co - aligned and placed in front of the two outputs of the beam combiner , enabling a high signal - to - noise measurement of the correlation in linear polarised light .",
    "as is usual with optical interferometry measurements , observations of targets were interleaved with un- or partially - resolved reference stars to calibrate the system correlation ( the @xmath21 response to a point source ) as a function of time . before use in adjusting the science measurements",
    ", this system response was also corrected for the known nonzero diameters of the reference stars given in table  [ tblcalstars ] . in this phase of the observational program , measurements were predominantly made of @xmath19 which had a much higher signal - to - noise than @xmath20 .",
    "this is mainly due to partially polarising beamsplitters used at susi to split off light to the tip / tilt adaptive optics camera , which had the effect of significantly lowering the system throughput for @xmath20 .",
    ".assumed diameters for the calibrator stars used for these observations [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     [ tblfitparams ]",
    "the dust free ( ud only ) fits in table  [ tblfitparams ] are clearly eliminated for both stars .",
    "the high @xmath23 values have their origin in the inability of this scattering - free model to generate any polarisation signal . of the two models with dust ,",
    "the thin shell model is a better fit than the outflow model for both stars .",
    "the best - fit condensation radii in the outflow models are also uncomfortably close to the continuum - forming photospheres for both stars .",
    "although there may be dust types that could plausibly exist in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field at these radii ( as discussed below ) , the gas temperatures in the model star of section  1 are 2000k at 1.1 stellar radii , much too high for grain nucleation ( e.g. see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "the only way dust could exist so close to the continuum - forming photosphere is if it had formed at near - minimum phases and then fallen in .",
    "however , this kind of motion is in conflict with the general assumptions of the outflow model .",
    "the two epochs of r  car do not show statistically significant differences , but the small differences at the level of about 1-@xmath24 are in the expected direction .",
    "the star appears to increase in apparent size from phase 0.08 to 0.15 , as predicted by the models , and the optical - depth in scattering appears to decrease , consistent with the dust being part of an infalling layer that is partially sublimating at these near - maximum phases . for rr  sco ,",
    "the discrepancy between the luminosity / model - predicted diameter and the best fit diameter is almost certainly due to contamination from the tio molecule . a moderate strength tio band at 850 nm is included in the wing of the susi filter profile which could account for the enlargement observed ,",
    "although predicting the effects of such molecular contamination is made difficult by its strongly cycle - dependent nature ( ireland et al .",
    "2004a ) .    from the discussion of dust formation radii in section  1 ,",
    "it is clear that `` dirty '' silicates can not form a major fraction of the optical depth in scattering due to dust around r  car . for survival within the hostile environment close to the photosphere",
    ", dust must have very low absorption between 1 and 4@xmath15 m where most of the radiation from the central star is emitted , and higher absorption coefficients at longer wavelengths promoting efficient radiative cooling .",
    "corundum is a clear possibility here , but another obvious dust type that satisfies these criteria is forsterite , the mg - rich olivine that is predicted to be the first significant silicate to form in chemical equilibrium calculations @xcite . the optical constants for this dust species as given in @xcite result in absorption coefficients 300 times higher at 10@xmath15 m than at 2@xmath15 m .",
    "this dust is stable at a radius of 1.2 stellar radii from the 3000k model star of section  1 . as a plausible and abundant dust candidate",
    ", we will assume that the dust around these stars is made of forsterite for the following analysis of the implications of the dust model parameters .",
    "low absorption at wavelengths where the bulk of the stellar radiation is emitted also results in lower radiation pressure on the dust .",
    "assuming full dynamical coupling between the gas and dust and full mg condensation , we can calculate the radiative acceleration as a fraction of the gravitational acceleration for an optically - thin model dust shell . for a shell made of forsterite around the 3000k model star of section  1 using mie theory to calculate absorption and scattering coefficients ,",
    "this fraction is 41% for spherical grains of radius 0.1@xmath15 m and 1.5% for grains of radius 0.02@xmath15 m .",
    "we therefore propose that this dust is formed in material primarily elevated by shocks , which in turn means that significant temporal variation in the dust shell optical depth and/or radius is expected .",
    "where the rayleigh limit of small particles with respect to the wavelength of scattered light applies , it is sufficient to approximate dust with a distribution of sizes as a homogeneous population with a single effective radius @xmath25 . for dust composed of forsterite , with a scattering optical depth of @xmath26 at 900 nm , typical of the observations presented here ,",
    "the optical depth in absorption at 10@xmath15 m is 1 for @xmath25 = 55 nm .",
    "results from a radiative transfer model of a geometrically thin shell of forsterite with a fixed temperature of 1100k and an optical - depth of 1 at two stellar radii from the centre of a spherical black - body 3000k star are displayed in figure  [ figmidirspect ] .",
    "it can be seen that there is no strong mid - infrared feature evident in either emission or absorption due to the dust shell .",
    "it would seem that the dust here represents an intermediate case between the compact geometries typically yielding absorption features , and spectra exhibiting emission which is usually associated with extended geometries . this result was found to be robust , and insensitive to the optical - depth of the shell .",
    "note , however , that a shell of forsterite with a 10 micron optical - depth much greater than 1 would heat up beyond its sublimation temperature at the inner edge of the thin dust shell . in order to meet this criteria while maintaining the observed 900 nm optical depth ,",
    "the effective particle size @xmath25 is constrained to be larger than about 50 nm . from the point of view of energetics , the failure of the dust to have a profound impact on the spectrum is simply a consequence of its optical properties : its inability to absorb in the near - infrared means that it can not redistribute the bulk of the stellar flux .",
    "the dust scattering measured by the technique in this paper is thus largely independent of the form of the infrared spectrum , and could therefore have remained hidden from investigations based on sed fitting . by this argument , the mid - infrared excess in the spectrum must come from a material that absorbs more strongly than forsterite in the near - infrared .",
    "dust that has evolved and been enriched with iron ( that condenses at lower temperatures ) in an outflow consisting of shells partially ejected in previous pulsation cycles could satisfy this property .",
    "more detailed mid - infrared spectral modeling is beyond the scope of this paper , but would need to include the emission from the extended molecular atmosphere as predicted by self - consistent modeling by @xcite and semi - empirical modeling of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "m optical - depth of 1 at 2 stellar radii , illuminated by a star with a 3000k black - body spectrum .",
    "flux is normalised to the 8@xmath15 m flux , and the 3000k black - body spectrum is overlaid for reference ( dotted line ) .",
    "iras _ low resolution spectrometer ( lrs ) spectra are overplotted for r  car ( crosses ) and rr  sco ( diamonds ) .",
    "the emission features in these spectra almost certainly come from a region geometrically more distant than that probed here ( see text ) . ]",
    "the dust uncovered here is not inconsistent with the mid - infrared measurements of @xcite .",
    "these authors fit an outflow model to r  leo ( which has slightly more pronounced mid - infrared emission than either r  car or rr  sco ) , with an optical depth at 11@xmath15 m of 0.1 . for forsterite dust with @xmath25 = 55 nm , this corresponds to a 900 nm optical depth of 0.025 .",
    "if a similar outflow were to exist around rr  sco or r  car in addition to the shell model , then its effect on the fit parameters in table  [ tblfitparams ] would be roughly within the quoted errors . in order to measure scattering from such an outflow , shorter baselines and higher precision would be required .    both r  car and rr  sco have relatively low mass - loss rates as constrained by co line observations .",
    "@xcite modeled the mass loss rate for rr  sco to be @xmath27 m@xmath28 per year and that of r  car to be less than @xmath29 m@xmath28 per year . if we assume full mg condensation at solar metallicity , then our best fit model with a shell at 2 stellar radii and an optical - depth 0.15 in scattering at 900 nm has a total mass of @xmath30 if we continue our assumptions of dust composed of forsterite with @xmath31 nm and full condensation .",
    "less than full condensation , or dust composed of the lower - abundance corundum would give an even higher mass shell .",
    "this means that the observed mass - loss rates are only consistent with the thin - shell model as long as the shell is considered nearly static , taking hundreds or thousands of pulsational cycles for material in the shell to be fully ejected .",
    "this is in turn consistent with the low radiative acceleration expected from dust that can exist so close to the stars .",
    "outflow models , on the other hand , were not so easy to fit within a self - consistent picture of stellar mass loss . using the measured co outflow velocity from @xcite of 3km / s for rr  sco we can calculate the mass - loss rate from a typical outflow model in table  [ tblfitparams ] . again assuming full mg condensation at solar metallicity for forsterite dust with @xmath25 = 55 nm , the mass loss rate for a model with our best fit optical - depth 0.25 in scattering at 900 nm and condensation radius of 1.1 stellar radii is @xmath32 m@xmath28 per year , much higher than the observed mass - loss rates .",
    "this demonstrates once again that the outflow model can be ruled out .",
    "using optical interferometric polarimetry , we have spatially separated the component of flux at 900 nm scattered by dust around the mira variables r  car and rr  sco from their photospheric emission .",
    "we found that the inner radius of dust formation around these stars to be less than three stellar radii , consistent with dust that is relatively transparent between 1 and 4@xmath15 m , such as iron - poor silicates or corundum .",
    "this dust exists in a shell - like structure around these stars that may have little influence on their mid - infrared spectra and is not part of an outflow .",
    "this result demonstrates the complexity of the circumstellar environment of mira variables where mass loss and dust formation are only made possible by pulsation .",
    "simple outflow models are grossly inadequate , and it is necessary to consider the changing optical properties of dust as it evolves from the condensation radius outwards .",
    "visual data for estimating the variability phases of targets at the times of the susi observations were obtained from the aavso website .",
