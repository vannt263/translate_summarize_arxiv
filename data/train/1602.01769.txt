    "occultation observations of the centaur 10199 chariklo on 2013 june 3 revealed two dense narrow rings , the first discovered around a minor planet @xcite .",
    "this surprising announcement immediately raised questions about the formation , lifetime , and ubiquity of rings around small bodies with active dynamical histories : centaurs are thought to be kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) scattered into the giant planet region by planetary encounters , and their typical dynamical lifetime is @xmath1few  myr @xcite .",
    "the discovery observation resolved the inner and more massive of the rings and , intriguingly , showed a significant difference between the ring widths measured during ingress ( @xmath4  km ) and egress ( @xmath5  km ) .",
    "further occultations in 2014 again indicated azimuthal variations in the width of the inner ring @xcite .",
    "if these variations are long - lived , they strongly suggest an apse - aligned ring with a finite eccentricity spread and , therefore , a finite overall eccentricity ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "this apse - alignment is surprising since chariklo s large oblateness ( @xmath6 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and implied @xmath7 moment should cause fast differential precession within the ring .",
    "this feature provides us with a convenient way to measure the ring mass .",
    "inspired by the work of @xcite on the narrow dense uranian rings , we describe here a simple model of chariklo s inner ring in which chariklo s oblateness and the ring s self - gravity together maintain the ring s apse alignment .",
    "we apply this model to derive a mass , typical particle size , and collisional spreading time for the ring (  [ sec : selfgravity ] ) .",
    "we discuss our results implications for existing dynamical / collisional ring formation models (  [ sec : formation ] ) , then propose and discuss a completely different model where the rings result from volatile outgassing (  [ sec : outgas ] ) .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings (  [ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "despite its small size ( equatorial radius @xmath8  km , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , chariklo appears quite oblate . assuming circular rings whose center and orbit normal coincide with chariklo s center and axis of symmetry",
    ", @xcite found an oblateness of @xmath9 . under the simplest assumption of uniform density , chariklo s lowest order gravitational moment",
    "would be @xmath10 .",
    "if chariklo has bulk density @xmath11  g  @xmath11 , the implied differential precession timescale for a ring with semimajor axis @xmath12  km and radial width @xmath13  km ( see table [ table : chariklo ] ) would be of order @xmath14 far shorter than any plausible system lifetime .    at the same time , multiple occultations in 2013 and 2014 indicate that the width of chariklo s inner , more massive ring varies with longitude from @xmath15.5  km to @xmath17.1  km @xcite . given the short orbit period ( @xmath116.4  hrs ) , this strongly suggests an eccentric apse - aligned ring whose eccentricity varies by at least @xmath15@xmath16 over the ring s total width.the mean eccentricity @xmath17 must be at least @xmath18  in a similar context , the rings of uranus have eccentricities 7 to 11 times larger than @xmath19 @xcite .    to maintain apse alignment in chariklo s rings , other forces must counter the dispersive effects chariklo s @xmath7 .",
    "one possibility is self - gravity within the ring , originally suggested by @xcite to explain the apse alignment of the uranian rings . to see this qualitatively",
    ", we think of the ring as a collection of non - crossing radially nested ringlets , a reasonable model for a cold system with frequent collisions ; self - gravity causes outer ringlets to feel an inwards radial force while inner ringlets feel an outwards radial force . in an eccentric ring that is narrower at periapse than at apoapse , the self - gravity forces at periapse",
    "dominate over those at other longitudes , so we can approximate these forces as impulses at periapse .",
    "such forces tend to enhance the forward precession of the outer ringlets and slow that of the inner ringlets , cancelling the differential precession due to chariklo s quadrupole .    given the observed system parameters , we can solve for the ring mass @xmath20 needed to maintain apse alignment .",
    "we give an order of magnitude estimate here ( ahead of an exact solution in  [ sec : exact ] ) by dividing a narrow ring into just two apse - aligned ringlets of masses @xmath21 , eccentricities @xmath17 and @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and semimajor axes @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 .",
    "we find the total gravitational force between the ringlets by estimating the force at each point and summing over longitude .",
    "for a point on , say , the inner ringlet at true anomaly @xmath27 , the force arises mostly from a segment of the outer ringlet at the same true anomaly at a distance @xmath28 away where @xmath29 non - crossing orbits in a ring narrower at periapse than apoapse require @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath31 we treat the segment on the outer ringlet as an infinite wire to find @xmath32 this acceleration is mostly radial ; the tangential component is smaller by a factor of order @xmath17 .",
    "equations @xcite then give an orbit averaged precession rate of @xmath33 setting this equal to the reciprocal of the right - hand side of equation  [ eq : j2_oom ] yields @xmath34 where we assume chariklo is an oblate spheroid with obliquity @xmath35 , constant bulk density @xmath36  g  @xmath11 and total mass @xmath37  g. note that finite @xmath17 and @xmath19 are crucial to the calculation of @xmath38 .      following the procedure of @xcite",

    "this gives @xmath85 in the above we have neglected precession due to collisions within the ring since we believe that particle - particle collisions contribute much less than self - gravity to differential precession for the ring profiles we consider , in contrast to the situation in uranus s @xmath86 ring @xcite .",
    "while both @xmath7 and @xmath84 are much larger in the chariklo system than in the uranus system , the @xmath87 and random velocity values are comparable . as a result ,",
    "precession from the central body s @xmath7 is much larger in the chariklo system than in the uranian case , while collisionally induced precession is much less important .",
    "however , if as in the work of @xcite on the uranian system ( a ) shepherd satellite(s ) increase(s ) the random velocity by more than an order of magnitude near the edge(s ) of chariklo s ring , collision - induced precession at the edge(s ) may significantly affect the derived ring mass : to balance the collisional and @xmath7 terms in the uranian rings , the total ring mass needs to increase by of order a factor of 10 @xcite .",
    "massive shepherd satellites could also significantly lengthen the spreading timescale . confirming the existence of such ( a ) satellite(s ) would require either an extremely high resolution ring profile or excellent luck in occultation timing .",
    "however , circumstantial evidence suggests that the satellite(s ) , if present , would be no larger than @xmath11  km in size . to be consistent with the width of the gap between chariklo s inner and outer rings ,",
    "a shepherd in the gap would need to be @xmath11  km in size .",
    "any shepherd interior to the rings must also be small .",
    "since the rings are slithgly gravitationally unstable , with toomre @xmath88 , they must lie within chariklo s roche radius in order to avoid fragmentation .",
    "further . ] an inner shepherd would likewise lie within the roche radius . since kbos larger than @xmath1300  km are expected to be rubble piles ( see , for example , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) , a large @xmath89  km inner shepherd would likely be subject to tidal disruption .",
    "as the total ring mass is comparable to that of a 1-km body , a 1-km shepherd would slow collisional diffusion only by a factor of order unity1  km outer shepherd paired with a small inner shepherd would not slow diffusion significantly , as the ring would preferentially spread inward ] , at most mildly lengthening our estimate for the spreading time .",
    "recent reinterpretation of occultation data of the second - largest centaur , 2060 chiron , as possible evidence of rings @xcite has further sharpened interest in ways to form rings around small bodies which have had close encounters with giant planets . dynamical formation mechanisms",
    "proposed thus far for centaur ring systems ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) fall into two broad categories which we discuss in light of our findings in  [ sec : selfgravity ] .      first",
    ", the rings may have formed while the centaur was still a member of the kuiper belt , probably via ejection of a small amount of material off the parent body s surface into an orbit within the roche radius .",
    "cratering collisions are one way to do this .",
    "simulations of such collisions at the @xmath11  km / s velocities typical of the kuiper belt ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) indicate that the ejected mass is of order the impactor mass and that the vast majority of ejected material departs at speeds of order the escape velocity .",
    "simulations of collisional satellite formation ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) likewise indicate that for velocities above the escape velocity , @xmath901% of ejected material remains in orbit long - term .",
    "so most likely only a small fraction of the ejecta in any given collision with chariklo ( escape velocity @xmath1100  m  s@xmath91 ) would remain in a close orbit . as the total mass of chariklo s rings is of order that of a @xmath11  km body , a ring creation event would require a substantially larger impactor which we take here to be @xmath15  km .    from @xcite , the optical depth to collisions for a @xmath1150-km target is @xmath1@xmath92^{2.7}$ ] , suggesting that a body like chariklo would have collided with a @xmath15-km projectile a few times over its few - gyr residence time in the kuiper belt .",
    "it therefore seems plausible that most kbos of chariklo s size could acquire ring systems or at least small satellites in this way .",
    "however , the short @xmath1@xmath2-year ring spreading time we find in  [ sec : results ] suggests that such systems formed of order @xmath931 gyr ago would have dispersed to low optical depths by the present day .",
    "rotational disruption may also lift boulders from the surface into orbit ; it may explain how near - earth asteroids ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) and in at least one case a kbo @xcite shed material from their surfaces into orbit , creating small satellites .",
    "this mechanism seems less likely for chariklo because its @xmath17-hr spin period @xcite is not extremely close to breakup , and because rotational disruption is infrequent enough that occurrence in the last @xmath2 yrs is unlikely .",
    "second , the rings may have formed during the close encounter(s ) with a giant planet , most likely neptune , that brought the parent body from the kuiper belt to a centaur orbit .",
    "for example , this encounter may have perturbed a small moon inward the roche radius , forcing it to tidally disrupt into a ring .    such a moon may have been captured by dynamical friction in the early history of the kuiper belt @xcite .",
    "moons of this kind tend to have close orbits and be similar in mass to the central body .",
    "alternatively , as discussed above , a typical @xmath1150-km kbo today has collided with a @xmath15  km projectile , placing perhaps @xmath941% of the projectile mass into orbit .",
    "if these ejecta end up outside the roche radius , they may well coalesce into satellites as described by @xcite for the earth - moon system and hypothesized for the small moons observed around large kbos @xcite .",
    "the tidal force needed to perturb a satellite inside the kbo s roche radius during a neptune close encounter depends on the satellite s initial orbit .",
    "we consider the case where the semimajor axes of the initial satellite orbit and the final ring differ by a factor of order unity and justify below why this is the most probable scenario . if the satellite s initial semimajor axis is @xmath95 , the change in velocity produced by the tidal force during a single neptune encounter with closest approach distance @xmath96 is @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the typical random velocity of a neptune - crossing kbo . to change the semimajor axis by a factor of order unity ,",
    "this velocity change must be of order the ring orbit velocity @xmath99 , implying @xmath100 where we use @xmath101  km / s .",
    "for this encounter , the impact parameter at infinity is @xmath102  cm .",
    "the same encounter changes the kbo s solar orbital velocity by of order @xmath103  km / s , which is just enough to move the kbo onto a centaur orbit .",
    "the centaur creation event may thus also serve as a ring creation event .",
    "note that this scenario works only for kbos that attain centaur orbits via a single close neptune encounter rather than multiple weak encounters .",
    "the much longer encounter duration in a weak scattering means the satellite can complete many orbits during a single encounter , severely diluting the effect of the tidal force . as a result , the kbo will likely become a centaur before the moon s orbit changes significantly . at the same time , a single very close neptune encounter that changes the moon s orbit velocity by more than an order unity factor will most likely unbind the moon from the kbo .",
    "ring formation via satellite disruption thus requires a single neptune encounter and a close match between the satellite orbit and the neptune encounter strength .",
    "this condition allows us to estimate the frequency of such satellite disruptions . since the number of centaurs created scales logarithmically with the distance of the closest encounter , and there are about @xmath104 natural logarithmic intervals between @xmath105 and neptune s hill radius , we expect that about one in six centaurs formed via a single neptune encounter",
    ". the typical centaur dynamical lifetime of @xmath1few million years @xcite and the @xmath1@xmath2-year ring spreading time suggests that only a small fraction of these , @xmath106 , would remain visible today . in the best scenario",
    " i.e.  if every large kbo has a close - in satellite , and assuming the single encounter with neptune is just strong enough for the kbo to attain a centaur - class orbit  the chance of observing a centaur with rings is @xmath1few percent .",
    "a further difficulty is the rapid rate of collisional destruction of small moons . at an impact velocity of @xmath11  km / s , the typical random velocity in the kuiper belt ,",
    "a @xmath120  m impactor can destroy a @xmath11  km moon . assuming a size distribution consistent with @xcite , the rate at which a given 1  km target encounters 20  m impactors in the current kuiper belt is about once every @xmath2 years , far faster than the creation rate of 1  km moons by impacts as described in ",
    "[ sec : ejection ] above .",
    "rotational fission is likewise unlikely to create moons fast enough to beat collisional destruction .",
    "the fast collisional destruction rate also makes significant collisional perturbation of a moon s orbit difficult .",
    "while a projectile of size at least @xmath1few hundred meters is needed to change the momentum of a 1  km moon by a factor of order unity , such a collision is likely to occur only once every @xmath1gyr . even assuming the moon s orbit is just a factor of @xmath12 larger than the roche radius",
    ", the moon will be destroyed before it can be collisionally moved close enough to the centaur .    for satellite disruption to be viable for ring formation at all",
    ", the satellites must therefore be more massive than the observed ring .",
    "since the catastrophic collision timescale for a 10- to 20-km kbo is about a gyr , a moon of that size could plausibly survive until centaur orbit insertion .",
    "the fraction of @xmath1100-km kbos with moons of this size is unknown : these moons are too large to form efficiently via cratering impacts and too small to be captured efficiently via dynamical friction , though rotational fission may provide an effective pathway .",
    "nevertheless , moons of similar size have been found around a few of the largest kbos @xcite .",
    "tidal disruption of such a large moon inside the roche radius would lead initially to a much more massive disk / ring , but because the initial diffusive spreading time would be correspondingly shorter , the ring lifetime would not be significantly longer than our estimate in  [ sec : results ] above .",
    "we conclude that among dynamical channels , compatibility between the ring spreading timescale and the expected time since formation weakly favors formation during a neptune close encounter , not during the few - gyr residence time in the kuiper belt .",
    "however , this scenario requires that most @xmath1100-km kbos have moons of size tens of kilometers or more , and it predicts a centaur ring occurrence rate of at most a few percent .",
    "in view of the uncertainties in the dynamical formation channels discussed in  [ sec : formation ] , we develop a contrasting mechanism for ring formation , dusty outgassing , briefly alluded to by @xcite .",
    "specifically , we discuss a simple model in which a dusty outflow entrained by co sublimating within chariklo deposits particles in close orbits . in  [ subsec : confront ] , we collect the available centaur observations and discuss them in the context of our theoretical predictions .",
    "we first estimate the rate and velocity of co outgassing from chariklo , taking into account its dynamical history .",
    "we focus on co here because of its high abundance and physical - chemical properties , but most of the discussion below applies if another volatile gas e.g. n@xmath3 , co@xmath3 , cn , is substituted .",
    "in particular , n@xmath3 has properties very similar to co in both triple point temperature and saturation vapor pressure and may be more abundant .",
    "we do not consider the alternative outgassing model where volatile gases are released by the exothermic process of water ice crystallization .",
    "while this process would increase the mass - loss rate above our estimates , we believe the correction would be order unity or less : scaling the crystallization model for chiron @xcite to the distance of chariklo gives an outgassing rate comparable to or smaller than ours .      as previous works have noted ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sublimation of surface co is fast even for bodies in the kuiper belt .",
    "an estimate of the maximum sublimation rate follows from equating the rates of insolation and latent heat absorption : @xmath107 where the latent heat of co sublimation is @xmath108 , the albedo is taken to be @xmath109 @xcite , and @xmath24 is chariklo s semimajor axis in its orbit around the sun .",
    "including surface cooling introduces only a small correction @xcite . at this rate , assuming a co mass fraction @xmath110 ( in line with previous comet measurements in e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , chariklo would have outgassed all of its co in @xmath2 yrs in the kuiper belt ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , well before being scattered inward .",
    "however , as numerous works have also argued ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this rate applies only to co that is exposed on the surface and can escape freely .",
    "if co is instead interspersed with ice and dust grains throughout the body , then once the surface co departs , the co vapor must first diffuse upward through the ice / dust matrix in order to escape measured from tidal splitting of comets and lab simulations of cometary ice @xcite , the co vapor pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) is too low to form vents at any significant depth .",
    "] and the loss rate slows significantly .    to estimate this slower loss rate , we consider the upward diffusion of a co molecule through convoluted tunnels formed by loosely packed icy / dusty grains .",
    "let the average size and number density of grains be @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "the porosity of the medium is then @xmath113 and the mean free path for gas - grain collisions is @xmath114 .",
    "assume solid co remains only below a depth @xmath115 .",
    "the co vapor pressure is the saturated value @xmath116 at this depth and decreases upward .",
    "the diffusive mass flux driven by the vapor density gradient over a single tunnel is @xmath117 where we have assumed the typical tunnel cross section is @xmath118 , the entire body has temperature @xmath119 , @xmath120 is the ideal gas sound speed at @xmath121 and @xmath119 , the vapor mass density is @xmath122 , and the diffusion coefficient is @xcite @xmath123 where @xmath124 , the so - called tortuosity , covers our ignorance on factors such as the extended length of a tunnel due to topology , the width distribution among tunnels , and the scattering property of gas molecules off the tunnel wall . over a unit surface area containing @xmath1@xmath125 tunnels ,",
    "the total mass - loss rate is @xmath126    to determine the appropriate depletion depth @xmath127 , also called the sublimation front , we assume that chariklo has been outgassing at temperature @xmath119 for most of its lifetime @xmath128 , @xmath129 we take the saturation vapor pressure to be @xcite @xmath130\\ , ,   \\label{eq : pvapor}\\ ] ] where the temperature is the local blackbody value at distance @xmath24 , that is , @xmath131 where @xmath132 this assumes that the heat needed for sublimation is negligible compared to re - radiation ( as we easily verified ) .",
    "the co loss rates from this simple model , shown as red dots in fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] , are orders of magnitude below the free escape loss rates ( solid lines ) . in particular , in the @xmath1few  gyr that chariklo presumably spent at 40  au , the co sublimation front would reach a depth 1  km ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .. ] if chariklo had instead spent that time at 20  au , all its co would have been depleted .",
    "interestingly , we reach nearly identical conclusions if we substitute n@xmath3 for co in the above discussion .",

    "chariklo s arrival in its current orbit ( @xmath134  au ) @xmath1few myrs ago @xcite should have strongly increased its temperature and co loss rate , as we discuss below ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "while the surface temperature would have jumped immediately from @xmath141  k to 68  k once chariklo reached 15.8  au , the co vapor pressure would have remained low until the co - rich matrix at depth @xmath135  km also warmed . to estimate the heat diffusion time through @xmath136",

    "after 10  myr , the thermal diffusion front lies @xmath147 below the surface , and the total co lost is @xmath148 this is a few orders of magnitude higher than the ring mass we inferred , so the total co outgassed is potentially enough to lift a ring s worth of solids off the surface .    ) . in this model ,",
    "most of the solar insolation is channelled into latent heat and the body maintains a temperature lower than the local blackbody value ( black dotted curves marked @xmath149 ) .",
    "the red dots show conditions when surface co is absent and co loss occurs only through upward diffusion through an ice / dust matrix ( eq .  [ eq : diffusion ] ) . in this model",
    ", chariklo stays close to the local blackbody temperature . for the computations we use",

    "the blue arrows indicate the increases in pressure and co mass loss when chariklo abruptly moved from 40  au to 16  au on becoming a centaur .",
    "seasonal freeze - thaw cycles can cause local outbursts whose outgassing rates greatly exceed the mass - loss rate at the tip of the blue arrow . ]",
    "since neither of the pole solutions published by @xcite coincide with chariklo s orbit normal , we expect strong seasonal variations in solar insolation .",
    "we now estimate the corresponding variations in co outgassing for later reference in  [ subsec : dustring]-[subsec : confront ] . in chariklo",
    "s polar regions the insolation variations cause large temperature fluctuations to a depth of order @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is chariklo s orbit period .",
    "the co diffusing through this layer experiences freeze - thaw cycles that drastically modulate the surface outgassing rate .    because co spends @xmath157 passing through this layer , its volume density there is @xmath158 , equivalent to a vapor pressure of @xmath159",
    "this is the saturation vapor pressure at @xmath160 ( eq . [ eq : pvapor ] ) , so if the winter hemisphere cools below this point , co will recondense .",
    "we can estimate the winter temperature by assuming that all heat content stored in layer @xmath161 is radiated as blackbody radiation during the winter is negligible . ] : @xmath162 within the winter polar circle , co therefore re - freezes on its way up from the deeper warm layer instead of escaping ; in one winter @xmath163 accumulates , mostly in the coldest layers near the surface .",
    "when spring arrives , the sublimation and escape of this trapped co proceeds nearly as for exposed co ( solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) , limited only by the insolation energy budget ( eq .  [ eq : mdot ] ) . as this maximum rate , @xmath164 , is one or two orders of magnitude higher than the annual rate , the trapped surface co is exhausted within a small fraction of an orbit . by assuming that the average annual co loss is outgassed at the maximum rate , we estimate the minimum duration of such an outburst is @xmath150 days .",
    "the true duration is likely longer .",
    "such short outgassing outbursts , occurring twice an orbit after equinoxes but not necessarily near periapse , may have been seen in the 2-d simulations of @xcite .",
    "although the total co lost is large compared to our ring mass of @xmath1@xmath0  g , that does not guarantee that the momentum and energy of the co outflow are enough to entrain dust particles and lift them into orbit .",
    "the minimum flow rate needed to lift a grain of size @xmath165 off the surface of chariklo is @xmath166 where we have adopted a dust grain density of @xmath167 . while this assumes the gas - dust coupling is in the stokes regime , the large mean free path we expect in the tenuous co flow would reduce the drag by of order unity and increase the minimum required co outflow rate by a similar factor .",
    "the average gas outflow rate of @xmath168 that we estimate in   [ subsubsec : minting ] for a newly migrated chariklo is thus unlikely to produce a dusty coma .",
    "this is consistent with chariklo s observed inactivity @xcite .",
    "however , our discussion of the seasonal co freeze / thaw suggests that in its current location , chariklo could show short bursts of activity with regional mass outflows exceeding the constraint in eq .  .",
    "at these times , we expect the co vapor to approximately share its momentum with any entrained grains , accelerating them to a final speed @xmath169 where @xmath27 is the solid to gas mass ratio in the outflow .",
    "if the dust and co mass fractions are comparable , most dust grains will not attain the escape velocity of @xmath1100  m / s  they remain bound to chariklo .",
    "indeed , @xcite reached a similar conclusion for chiron , a slightly smaller centaur , arguing that predominantly bound grains may explain why chiron s coma has a steep surface - brightness profile more consistent with an atmosphere than an unbound halo .",
    "initially the outflow puts grains on roughly radial trajectories that re - intersect chariklo s surface within less than an orbit .",
    "though chariklo s rotation ( 7-hr period ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) imparts to the grains a tangential velocity of @xmath1one - third the surface escape speed ( for a bulk density of @xmath170 ) , this is only a fraction @xmath171 of the orbital angular momentum at distance @xmath172 .",
    "grains will therefore quickly re - accrete onto chariklo unless they collide with other grains before re - intercepting the surface .",
    "we can estimate the collision probability as follows .",
    "the mean - free path of grains in the outflow is @xmath173 , where grain number density @xmath174 . after a free - fall time ( @xmath175 )",
    ", the collision probability is @xmath176 each grain should suffer multiple collisions given our estimated flow rate .",
    "we expect collisions to tend to redistribute angular momentum among grains , allowing a fraction @xmath177 of the grains to remain in orbit .",
    "@xmath177 is hard to estimate as it depends on the detailed collision geometry and collision probability .",
    "however , these surviving grains final orbits are most likely close to the surface , where collisions are more frequent and the required angular momentum is lower . finally , grains that remain in orbit collide with one another , damping their relative velocities . since the grains inherit chariklo s rotational velocity",
    "when they leave the surface , their total angular momentum is parallel to chariklo s .",
    "the grains mutual collisions cause them to settle into chariklo s equatorial plane in a ring configuration .",
    "this mechanism thus favors the formation of a ring that lies inward of the roche radius , though close - in moons slightly further away are also possible .",
    "how these orbiting grains might attain the narrow dense ring geometry currently observed around chariklo is not clear , however .",
    "we can estimate the dust mass remaining in orbit as @xmath178 here @xmath179 is the fraction of the co loss that occurs in short outbursts  roughly , the fractional area of polar regions on chariklo multipled by the fractional length of winter . when the obliquity is @xmath180 , @xmath181 ; the pole solutions of @xcite and the orbit given for chariklo in the jpl small body database indicate the polar regions cover about one - half the total surface , so we adopt @xmath182 . while @xmath177 is highly uncertain , unless @xmath183 the dust mass placed in orbit via",
    "co outgassing is comparable to our calculations in  [ sec : selfgravity ] , which is encouraging .",
    "the particle size of @xmath1few  meters we estimate for the current ring is likely unrelated to the original grain size .",
    "frequent collisions may cause the grains to stick together mechanically , increasing the typical particle size .",
    "we leave a detailed description of ring particle growth , and of the particles settling into a narrow ring geometry , to future work .",
    "we now collect available observations on centaurs to test two important aspects of our model : 1 ) that co should be preserved in the deep interior and may sublimate and diffusively migrate to the surface once the centaurs are heated in their new location ; and 2 ) that co outgassing may lift dust grains off their surfaces either continuously for hotter centaurs or upon the start of spring in colder centaurs .",
    "highly relevant for the first of these are observations of comet outgassing , which suggest that co ( and possibly co@xmath3 ) is relatively abundant ( @xmath110% relative to h@xmath3o , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while o@xmath3 occurs at a surprisingly high @xmath13% @xcite and n@xmath3 occurs at a surprisingly low @xmath10.1% @xcite .",
    "this motivates us to focus on co. we argue in  [ sec : tworates ] that while exposed co on kbo surfaces would have sublimated long ago , co should retain its primordial abundance in layers deeper than @xmath11  km and could diffuse upward rapidly upon displacement of the kbos to warmer regions of the solar system .",
    "this may explain the detection of co outgassing in comet 29p / sw1 ( @xmath184  au , @xmath185 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , comet hale - bopp ( at @xmath186  au , @xmath187  km , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and possibly centaur 2060 chiron ( @xmath188  au , @xmath189 , @xcite , though this has been challenged by @xcite ) . for these objects",
    "our simple model predicts co loss rates between @xmath190 and @xmath191 , depending on their current orbits , consistent with observations .",
    "but our explanation is not unique ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and a number of surveys @xcite have failed to detect co around other centaurs and kbos . some of these upper limits contradict our predictions ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colimit ] ) : for the few largest centaurs like chariklo , chiron , pholus and asbolus , we predict outgassing rates some 1 - 2 orders of magnitude above the observed upper limits .",
    "this could be partly due to a residence time in the centaur region of @xmath93few  myr , since co outgassing slows as the sublimation front retreats further below the surface .",
    ", assuming a temperature that is appropriate for a blackbody receiving the orbit - averaged illumination , an albedo of @xmath192 , a porosity @xmath152 , a tortuosity @xmath153 , and a co depletion depth of @xmath193 .",
    "the theoretical predictions are inconsistent with the observed upper limits for a few large centaurs , marked by their respective names .",
    "this could reflect a longer ( @xmath93few  myr ) residence time in the centaur region .",
    "the symbol sizes indicate body sizes . ]",
    "moreover , the dust production rate roughly scales with the predicted co rate .",
    "likewise , most inactive objects have co outgas rates below @xmath1@xmath194 ; however , a few centaurs with large predicted co outgas rates remain inactive . ]    for information on dust grain lifting we turn to observations of cometary activity in centaurs @xcite .",
    "the origin of these cold objects activity remains a puzzle .",
    "@xcite has argued that co outgassing can not be the correct explanation based on the simple @xmath195 law expected for surface co sublimation rate .",
    "however , as our calculation in fig .",
    "[ fig : activity ] shows , our predicted co outgas rates largely explains the observed dust production rates in active centaurs .",
    "the outgas rate depends almost exponentially ( not as @xmath195 ) on the illumination - weighted orbital separation , which in turn depends on the semimajor axis and the eccentricity . moreover , for all but one of the centaurs observed to be active we predict @xmath196 , the criterion for dust lifting in eq .  .",
    "similarly , most centaurs observed to be inactive have predicted co outgas rates below @xmath197 , though a handful of inactive objects with high predicted co outgas rates exist .    for chariklo",
    "we predict a low anuual co outgas rate , @xmath198 ; typically it should therefore be inactive , as is observed @xcite .",
    "however , we argue that it should exhibit short co outbursts , occurring twice an orbit after equinoxes and lasting of order a few months or longer .",
    "this would lift up the dust grains and be observed as a flaring in brightness or an excess in co emission .",
    "unfortunately , we know of no photometry of chariklo after the last equinox in 2008 @xcite , and the next one is not until 2039 . for chiron ,",
    "two outbursts were reported in 1989 @xcite and 2001 @xcite . while @xcite propose that chiron was most likely at equinox in 1983 and 1999 , chariklo s pole position is highly uncertain .",
    "available lightcurves of chiron are insufficient to allow a good pole solution @xcite .",
    "also , although the @xcite analysis is based on their interpretation of the @xcite occultation data as rings , @xcite themselves favor a jet / outburst interpretation . nonetheless ,",
    "if the @xcite equinox times are established firmly , they would indeed cast doubt on our model for ring formation at least for chiron s case and demand a new explanation for chiron s outbursts .",
    "assuming the width variations seen in chariklo s inner ring are long - lived , they indicate that the ring is apse - aligned , that its eccentricity changes by at least several parts in a thousand between its inner and outer edges , and , by analogy to the uranian rings , that its overall eccentricity may be a few percent or more . if the apse alignment is maintained by a balance between self - gravity within the ring and chariklo s large @xmath7 moment , we find the total ring mass is of order a few@xmath199  g. if the ring particles form a monolayer , they have typical size of order a few meters and velocity dispersion of order a few mm / s .",
    "these figures are a few times smaller than those observed in saturn s main rings @xcite and are within the observational bounds for those of the @xmath86 ring of uranus @xcite .",
    "our estimates of the ring particle size and velocity dispersion indicate that the ring s collisional spreading time is of order @xmath2 years , somewhat shorter than the typical centaur dynamical lifetime of a few myr @xcite .",
    "this short spreading time favors ring formation scenarios that occur during or after chariklo s move from the kuiper belt to its current location among the giant planets .",
    "thus , while impacts from @xmath110  km bodies during chariklo s few - gyr sojourn in the kuiper belt could easily have thrown enough ejecta into orbit to form rings , it is unlikely that rings so formed would have lasted long enough to be the ring system we see today .",
    "perhaps more likely is ring formation from an initially close - in satellite pushed inside the roche radius during the close encounter with neptune that turned chariklo into a centaur .",
    "however , this requires a close match between the satellite s initial orbit energy and the strength of the neptune encounter .",
    "that 2060 chiron likely also hosts rings @xcite suggests that centaurs with rings may occur more often than this formation scenario can easily accommodate .",
    "we also consider ring formation via a very different process : dust particles lifted from chariklo into close orbit by an outflow of sublimated co. when chariklo shifted from a more distant orbit to one with its current @xmath116  au periapse distance , the corresponding increase in the equilibrium temperature and therefore partial pressure of co @xmath200  km below the surface could have forced dust particles off the surface and , after mutual collisions , into ring orbits . if rings are indeed associated with outgassing , we predict that they should be ubiquitous among large centaurs but absent among small comets and very large kbos ( e.g. , pluto ) .",
    "in addition , our model predicts that the co sublimation rate should surge within a few months of an equinox crossing .",
    "further observations to refine the pole positions of chariklo , chiron , and possibly other centaurs , and to monitor their brightness during the several months following equinoxes , would provide a very clear test for ring formation via outgassing .",
    "additional high - cadence and/or multi - chord occultation observations that further constrain the ring surface density profile , the ring widths , and chariklo s shape and orientation within the rings will help us better assess these and other formation mechanisms for the chariklo system .",
    "moreover , some of the proposed ring formation scenarios suggest that many more centaurs should have rings or small moons .",
    "we hope that future occultation observations of different centaurs can test this prediction .",
