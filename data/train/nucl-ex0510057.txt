    ", @xmath5 is an important observable due to its sensitivity to the eos , and through it to a possible phase transition to the qgp .",
    "the @xmath13 is important because @xmath0 is a baryon and in comparison to other particle species could be used to check the mass ordering effect and to compare it with hydrodynamical predictions which depend on eos used . testing the differential flow measurements of different particle species against different scaling scenarios may yield additional information about the origin of flow .",
    "the ceres experiment consists of two radial silicon drift detectors ( sdd ) , two ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) detectors and a radial drift time projection chamber ( tpc ) . due to its full azimuthal coverage close to mid - rapidity",
    "the ceres spectrometer is ideally suited for elliptic flow studies .",
