    "consider a two - dimensional strong markov process @xmath6 with state space @xmath7 , given on a family of probability spaces @xmath8 which satisfies the stochastic differential equation @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a standard brownian motion , and @xmath11 is a measurable function .",
    "processes of this type are common in mathematical finance , and in this context , @xmath4 would be the discounted price of an asset while @xmath5 is a process giving the so - called stochastic volatility",
    ".    we shall refer to this application in the examples , as it was our motivation in the beginning . however , the methods used are of a broader nature and can be applied in a wider context .",
    "this paper mainly deals with the regularity of the value function @xmath12,\\qquad ( x , y)\\in\\bfr\\times\\bfs,\\ ] ] with respect to the optimal stopping problem given by @xmath0 , a discount rate , a time horizon @xmath13 $ ] and a measurable gain function @xmath14 . but for financial applications ( see section  [ option pricing ] ) , a slightly modified value function of type    @xmath15 \\ ] ]    is also considered where @xmath16 stands for the instantaneous interest rate .",
    "the supremum in ( [ osp ] ) and ( [ eq1.2prime ] ) is taken over all _ finite _ stopping times with respect to the filtration generated by the pair of processes @xmath0 .    to ensure the well - posedness of this problem",
    ", we assume the integrability condition ( recall that @xmath17 may be infinite ) @xmath18 < \\infty \\qquad\\mbox{for all } ( x , y)\\in\\bfr\\times \\bfs,\\ ] ] which is a common assumption in the context of optimal stopping problems .    note that this condition is satisfied if @xmath19 is bounded . for more general functions , verifying this condition can be fairly difficult , and its validity may depend on the particular choice of the dynamics for @xmath0 .",
    "our main focus is on proving the monotonicity of @xmath20 with respect to @xmath21 , and we are able to verify this property in the case of the following two classes of strong markov processes under not too restrictive conditions ( see theorems  [ main one ] and [ main two ] ) :    * _ regime - switching _ : @xmath5 is a skip - free continuous - time markov chain ( see page  ) which is independent of the brownian motion @xmath22 driving equation ( [ eq : dynx ] ) . * _ diffusion _ : @xmath5 solves a stochastic differential equation of the type @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a standard brownian motion such that the quadratic covariation satisfies @xmath25 , for some real parameter @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 are measurable functions .",
    "note that , in the second class , the joint distribution of @xmath4 and @xmath5 is uniquely determined if the system of equations ( [ eq : dynx ] ) , ( [ vol_w ] ) admits a weakly unique solution , and the process @xmath5 does not have to be independent of the driving brownian motion @xmath22 , whereas , in the case of the first class , the process @xmath5 is not given by an equation , and the assumed independence of @xmath5 and @xmath22 is a natural way of linking @xmath4 and @xmath5 if there is too little information about the structure of the pair @xmath0 .",
    "our technique is based on time - change and coupling .",
    "equation ( [ eq : dynx ] ) goes back to a volatility model used by hobson in @xcite who also applies time - change and coupling but for comparing prices of european options .",
    "as far as we know , our paper is the first paper dealing with the extra difficulty of applying this technique in the context of optimal stopping .",
    "it should be mentioned that ekstrm @xcite , theorem  4.2 , can compare prices of american options if @xmath28 in equation ( [ eq : dynx ] ) and @xmath29 also depends on time .",
    "nevertheless , it seems to be that his method can not be applied in the case of nontrivial processes @xmath5 .",
    "we provide some examples to illustrate the results . in the case of regime - switching , we look at the pricing of perpetual american put options which , for @xmath30 , was studied by guo and zhang @xcite for a two - state markov chain and by jobert and rogers @xcite for a finite - state markov chain .",
    "while the former , since the situation is much easier , gave a closed - form expression for the price , the latter could only provide a numerical algorithm to approximate the value function which gives the price of the contract .",
    "it turns out that the algorithm in the case of a chain with many states can be very time - intensive if the unknown _ thresholds _ which characterize the optimal stopping rule are not known to be in a specific order when labeled by the different volatility states _ before _ the algorithm starts .",
    "however , based on our result that the value function @xmath20 is monotone in @xmath2 , we are now able to give conditions under which these _ thresholds _ must be in a monotone order .    ultimately , in the case where @xmath5 is a diffusion , we verify the continuity and monotonicity of the value function @xmath20 with respect to @xmath31 for two important volatility models , the heston @xcite and the hull and white @xcite model . note that , using entirely different methods , differentiability and monotonicity in the volatility parameter of european option prices under the hull and white model were studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite also showed a connection between the monotonicity in the volatility parameter and the ability of an option to complete the market .",
    "another motivation to study the monotonicity of the value function in the volatility parameter @xmath2 is that the numerical solution of the corresponding free - boundary problem becomes a lot easier if we know that the continuation region is monotonic in @xmath2 and if we know that the corresponding free - boundary is continuous .",
    "moreover , we will show , in a sequel , under the assumption of continuity , how to solve a game - theoretic version of the american put problem corresponding to model uncertainty for the stochastic volatility .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ regswi ] the monotonicity of the value function @xmath20 with respect to @xmath32",
    "is shown in the case of regime - switching , and the main method is established . in section  [ diffu ]",
    "the main method is adapted to the case of a system of stochastic differential equations ( [ eq : dynx ] ) , ( [ vol_w ] ) which is the diffusion case , while in section  [ conti ] we use monotonicity to show the continuity of the value function @xmath20 with respect to @xmath31 in the diffusion case . in section  [ option pricing ]",
    "we reformulate our results in the context of option pricing .",
    "then all our examples are discussed in detail in section  [ example section ] and , in the , we prove auxiliary results and some of the corollaries .    finally , it should be mentioned that all our results and proofs would not change in principle if the state space of @xmath0 is @xmath33 with @xmath34 instead of @xmath35 . the only change in this case",
    "[ see corollary [ version for negative](ii ) ] would be to _ order _ : _ increasing _ becomes _ decreasing_. however , as pointed out in the proof of corollary  [ version for negative](ii ) , our method can not be applied to show the monotonicity of @xmath20 in @xmath21 if @xmath36 contains a neighborhood of zero .",
    "we do not know either how to generalize our method to the nonmartingale case .",
    "suppose @xmath37 , @xmath38 is a strong markov process given on a family of probability spaces @xmath39 , @xmath40 which satisfies the following conditions :    [ a and b ]    the process @xmath0 is adapted with respect to a filtration @xmath41 , of sub-@xmath42-algebras of @xmath43 and , for every @xmath44 , there is an @xmath45 brownian motion @xmath46 on @xmath47 independent of @xmath48 such that @xmath49    the process @xmath5 is a continuous - time markov chain on the finite state space @xmath50 with @xmath51-matrix @xmath52)$ ] .",

    "[ a1 ] let @xmath514 be given on the filtered probability space @xmath515 as introduced in section  [ regswi ] .",

    "now , as the left - hand side of the estimate ( [ ineq ] ) is trivially bounded from below since @xmath19 is bounded from below , we obtain @xmath526 using fatou s lemma , lemma [ with feller ] and remark [ new g](ii ) .",
    "the remaining arguments below ( [ fatou ] ) used to show proposition [ left conti for inf ] also apply in the case where ( [ eq1.2prime ] ) holds proving the left - continuity claimed in part ( i ) . and",

    "in addition to ( [ eins ] ) , ( [ zwei ] ) , ( [ drei ] ) there will be an extra term like ( [ extra term ] ) .",
    "we only need to justify why lebesgue s dominated convergence theorem can be applied with respect to this extra term after substituting the sequence @xmath548 and here , but only in the case of @xmath300 , one needs @xmath19 to be bounded from below .",
