    "in recent years , the question of photometric identification of supernova candidates has emerged as one of the crucial issues to be resolved before the advent of large - space supernova cosmology experiments , both ground - based ( _ e.g. _ , the large synoptic survey telescope [ lsst ] , the dark energy survey [ des ] , the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system [ pan - starrs ] ) , and space - based ( _ e.g. _ , the _ joint dark energy mission [ jdem ] _ ) .",
    "there are a number of reasons for this .",
    "first , although there have been some interesting developments in the possible uses of supernova other than type ia for cosmology  @xcite , type ia supernovae ( snia ) remain the staple of experimental cosmology .",
    "second , sne ia are most reliably identified using spectroscopy due to the presence of a characteristic siii line at 6150  in the supernova rest frame . however , future large ground - based surveys are expected to collect thousands of supernova candidates , making a spectroscopic follow - up of each candidate all but unrealistic .",
    "the identification of supernova candidates ( with possible spectroscopic follow - up for a select sample ) based on broadband photometry remains the only feasible alternative .",
    "there have been a number of methods proposed to identify supernovae using broadband photometry that can be divided into three broad categories .",
    "one includes methods that rely on color - color or color - magnitude diagrams  @xcite .",
    "it is also possible to fit supernova data to models , and select the best fit ( using , for example , a @xmath0 ) , which can be used to represent the supernova type  @xcite . finally , the third category involves recently developed techniques based on a probabilistic ( bayesian ) approach to the problem  @xcite .",
    "the method proposed in this work , although closer in spirit to the second category , has a number of advantages over both .    the existing techniques , while adequate in many cases , have a number of serious shortcomings .",
    "for example , supernova identification schemes based on color - color and color - magnitude diagrams involve comparing the colors and/or magnitudes of a given supernova candidate with what is predicted by various supernova models .",
    "this is an intuitive approach , allowing one to visually judge the goodness of fit of the data to the models ; however , it is difficult to account for all statistical and systematic uncertainties in a single step .    a class of techniques that could be generally described as `` @xmath0-based '' simply find the best fit for a given supernova candidate s light curves to a supernova model .",
    "this is also an intuitive and often completely reasonable approach , which nevertheless suffers the following disadvantages :    1 .",
    "[ item:1 ] `` this object is not a supernova of any kind '' is not a well - defined hypothesis in this as in any other frequentist approach  @xcite .",
    "conversely , if the data happen to have large uncertainties , there is the possibility that a number of supernova models will be good fits to the data .",
    "there is no formalism to compute not only the probability that a given fit is good , but also that it is bad . in other words ,",
    "what one is interested in is the posterior probability , the probability that a given hypothesis is true given the data . calculating this probability",
    "requires that the probability that this hypothesis is false be also known .",
    "3 .   using a @xmath0-based technique only gives the information about the best fit for a given set of data to a model , while any information about worse fits is lost .",
    "the best fit will not necessarily reflect the true properties of the supernova .",
    "4 .   in cases where one would like to use a tail probability for accepting or rejecting given supernova candidates ( _ e.g.",
    "_ , as sne ia ) , the probability of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis ( the so called type i error rate ) can be shown to be severely underestimated ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "bayesian classification schemes address many of the problems of the above - mentioned methods .",
    "however , existing bayesian - based supernova typing methods have a serious drawback : they require the knowledge of the complete set of objects that a supernova candidate might conceivably be @xcite .",
    "that is , they assume that a supernova candidate can only be one of a finite set of supernova types .",
    "however , even with the current small high - redshift sn sample ( obtained almost exclusively with the hubble space telescope ) one occasionally finds supernova candidates with surprising new properties that do not seem to conform to any known models  @xcite .",
    "problems with assuming a finite set of supernova - like objects are further addressed in section  [ sec : danger ] .    in our work",
    ", we introduce a likelihood ratio ( a bayes factor ) that is capable of discriminating between sne ia and _ anything else _ based on broadband photometric measurements .",
    "the most important feature of this technique is that it is independent of the knowledge of the complete set of objects that a supernova candidate might conceivably be .",
    "another advantage is that , as with all bayesian - based techniques , this method allows one to include all possible statistical and systematic uncertainties in a single step .",
    "finally , the bayes factor is formulated in terms of color and thus does not require that one make any assumptions about the absolute magnitudes of the supernova candidates in the broadband filters used .",
    "of course it is often desirable to include magnitudes in the formalism ; however , not only does it require making assumptions about the distribution of magnitudes for various known supernova types , but also it places a hard upper limit on the intrinsic magnitudes of objects that have yet to be observed . but more importantly",
    ", `` anomalous '' ( non - supernova ) objects can be defined in a far more mathematically elegant and computationally manageable way using color alone .",
    "the bayes factor is defined as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the probability of obtaining the observed photometry ( colors ) from a sn ia , and @xmath3 is the probability of obtaining the data for any other object ( which could be a non - sn ia or any other object capable of mimicking an sn ia signal ) .",
    "both probabilities take into account the _ relative _ distribution of light among the broadband filters used for the measurements . in general , no specific set of models ( or templates ) for non - sne ia is required for the calculation of the denominator .    on a more technical note",
    ", it is worthwhile to point out that bayes factors are normally used for deciding on the best of two hypotheses .",
    "this allows one to easily set thresholds on the bayes factor in terms of the so - called type i and type ii error rates in the same way as thresholds are set on the likelihood ratio in  @xcite .",
    "also , although the main focus of this work is to describe a method that can identify sne ia , the bayes factor can be easily cast in terms of a posterior probability that a candidate is a type @xmath4 supernova , where @xmath4 could be ibc , ii - p , iin , _",
    "etc._. , a hypothesis @xmath5 , and its alternative @xmath6 .",
    "the bayes factor can be defined as @xmath7 the posterior probability that the alternative hypothesis is true for the data can then be written in terms of @xmath8 provided that one knows the priors for @xmath5 and @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively : @xmath11 see  @xcite for details .",
    "although there are historical reasons why the bayes factor is formulated in this way , it is also convenient when setting thresholds for the error rates because often the errors rates are at least somewhat determined by the information contained in the priors on @xmath5 and @xmath6 . ]",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ section :",
    "math ] we derive an expression for @xmath8 for a number of different cases .",
    "we describe the performance of the method in section  [ section : performance ] . section  [ section : disc ] presents a discussion of the results .",
    "the bayes factor , @xmath8 , introduced above , is defined as the probability of obtaining the photometric measurements assuming that the supernova candidate is a type ia over the probability that it is anything else . in practice ,",
    "the probability that a candidate is an sn ia is the probability that the colors are consistent with what is expected for an sn ia using some prior knowledge about the behavior of type ia s . in our first formulation of the bayes factor , if the candidate is not in fact an sn ia , then the distribution of light in the broadband filters used can be arbitrary .",
    "however , one could argue that much of the background for sne ia will be supernovae of other types whose behavior is relatively well - known",
    ". however , the unprecedented scale of the future supernova surveys makes it highly likely that many new types of transient objects will be discovered .",
    "also , little is known about the _ rates _ of non - type ia supernovae , especially at very high redshifts , making it difficult to predict the behavior of the background at those redshifts .",
    "we begin with a general overview of the calculation of @xmath8 . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that there are only two broadband filters , and that there is a single measurement of the supernova candidate s flux in each .",
    "suppose that the flux is measured in photon counts , and that @xmath12 counts are measured in the first filter , and @xmath13 , in the second .",
    "further suppose that there exists a model ( a template ) for the behavior of sne ia in these filters , and that the model predicts that some mean fraction of photons , @xmath14 , must end up in the first filter , and 1-@xmath14 , in the second .",
    "the numerator of @xmath8 , @xmath2 , is essentially the probability that the measurement is consistent with this model .",
    "assuming poisson statistics for the photon distributions , it can be easily shown that @xmath2 takes the form of a standard binomial distribution : @xmath15 for the calculation of the denominator of @xmath8 , @xmath3 , we do not make any _ a priori _ assumptions about the fraction of light that will end up in either filter .",
    "the bayesian framework of the calculation allows one to circumvent this difficulty by marginalizing , or integrating over , all possible fractions .",
    "mathematically , @xmath16    in reality , the calculation becomes rather more complicated . to begin with",
    ", the measured flux will most likely be better described using gaussian , rather than poisson , statistics .",
    "we must also allow for the possibility of multiple measurements and more than 2 filters .",
    "in the next section we will make the the calculation more explicit and account for all of these factors .",
    "before we plunge into the full derivation of @xmath8 for the case of gaussian statistics and multiple measurements and filters , we take a closer look at the simple case of a single measurement of a supernova candidate in just two filters , assuming that the photon count fluctuations in the filters are poisson . recall that we assume that @xmath12 counts are measured by the first filter and @xmath13 by the second ; and that we have a model that predicts a certain fraction of photons , @xmath14 , for the first filter , and @xmath17 , for the second .",
    "following a similar derivation in @xcite , let us now introduce two variables , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , such that the mean number of photons in the first filter is given by @xmath20 , and the mean number of photons in the second filter is given by @xmath21 .",
    "variable @xmath19 ranges from 0 to @xmath22 , and can be thought of as the mean number of photons that are counted in both filters for a given measurement .",
    "variable @xmath18 ranges from 0 to 1 , and can be thought of as the probability that the photons will end up in the first filter as opposed to the second .",
    "an analogy would be collecting balls into two receptor bins with different volumes : in this case , @xmath19 would be the mean number of balls that will enter both bins , and @xmath18 is the relative `` acceptance '' of one bin .",
    "the introduction of these variables allows us to expand the bayes factor , eqn.[eqn : general ] , in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 : @xmath23    here , the first term in the numerator , @xmath24 , is the likelihood of obtaining the measurement given that the mean number of photons was measured to be @xmath25 in the first filter , and @xmath26 in the second .",
    "likewise , the first term in the denominator , @xmath27 , is the likelihood of obtaining the measurement given that the mean number of photons was measured to be @xmath20 in the first filter , and @xmath21 in the second .",
    "note that the numerator is not a function of @xmath18 because @xmath18 is single valued in the numerator , @xmath28 .",
    "if the photon distribution is governed by poisson statistics , then : @xmath29 and @xmath30    the terms @xmath31 in the numerator and @xmath32 in the denominator of eqn.[eqn : general_expanded ] , are prior probabilities containing information regarding the expected distribution of light in the two filters for an sn ia and anything else , respectively . defining @xmath33 and @xmath34 as the minimum and maximum bounds for @xmath19 and assuming each value for @xmath19 in between these bounds is equally probable , we have : @xmath35 note that the range of @xmath19 will always be assumed to be @xmath36 $ ] , although the upper and lower bounds will initially be set to @xmath34 and @xmath33 , respectively .  _",
    "i.e. _ , to avoid priors whose probabilities approach 0 .",
    "] however , if the candidate is not an sn ia , we do not make any assumptions about what to expect , and so : @xmath37 as the upper ( @xmath38 ) and lower ( @xmath39 ) bounds of @xmath18 are 1 and 0 , respectively .",
    "note that @xmath31 and @xmath32 are _ improper priors _ ( in other words , they assume probability density functions that are flat and are integrated from zero to infinity ) .",
    "this is not a major issue for our calculation because the priors happen to cancel .",
    "however , in general the use of improper priors must be treated with caution  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to check that @xmath8 does indeed behave properly ; this will be addressed further in section[section : results ] .    with these priors , eqn .",
    "[ eqn : general_expanded ] becomes : @xmath40    in the calculation of eqn.[eqn : intermediate1 ] @xmath19 is effectively unconstrained , leaving the supernova candidate s magnitude free to take on any value .",
    "that is , as we are only concerned with the relative fraction of photons in each filter ( _ i.e. _ , color ) , we need not make any assumptions about the behavior of @xmath19 .",
    "we would now like to derive an equation analogous to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : intermediate1 ] , but for the case of gaussian statistics .",
    "let us suppose that instead of measuring @xmath12 photons in the first filter and @xmath13 in the second , we now measure a flux @xmath41 in the first filter with an error @xmath42 , and a flux @xmath43 in the second filter with an error @xmath44 .",
    "as before , we parametrize the mean ( or `` true '' ) fluxes in the two filters as @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and expand @xmath8 in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath19 , leading to eqn .",
    "[ eqn : general_expanded ] .",
    "we then simply replace the poisson distributions with gaussian ones using the usual notation for a gaussian distribution , @xmath45 .",
    "equation[eqn : general_expanded ] becomes @xmath46 the integration over @xmath19 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gaussian ] can be reduced further leading to the appearance of the gauss error function .",
    "however , the integration over @xmath18 in the denominator can only be done numerically .",
    "we now make eqn .",
    "[ eqn : gaussian ] even more realistic by considering multiple measurements ( say , @xmath47 ) and an arbitrary number of filters ( say , @xmath48 ) . using the formalism we have developed above",
    ", we will assume that for the @xmath49 measurement the fraction of light in the @xmath50 filter is @xmath51 , and the total light distributed between all the filters and all the measurements is given by @xmath19 .",
    "therefore , the hypothesized flux in the @xmath50 filter and @xmath49 measurement is given by @xmath52 . again , if the supernova is assumed to be a type ia , then we have a model that describes the fraction of light in each of the filters for each of the measurements must be .",
    "the model must take into account the many possible observational parameters that characterize an sn ia .",
    "for example , it is known that sne ia have a variety of possible `` stretch '' values , which parametrize the width of their light curves  @xcite .",
    "following the approach used in  @xcite , we represent the type ia supernova parameters by @xmath53 , defined as @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the stretch parameter ; @xmath56 and @xmath57 parametrize the effect of interstellar dust extinction using the cardelli - clayton - mathis ( ccm ) parametrization  @xcite ; @xmath58 accounts for the difference in the time of maximum of the model and the data ; and @xmath59 is the redshift . in other words , for type ia s @xmath51 will become @xmath60 .",
    "the exact assumptions about the distribution of these parameters will be discussed below when the prior probabilities for all of the @xmath53 parameters will be stated explicitly .    since , in general , the exact values of each of these parameters for a given candidate are unknown , they must be marginalized .",
    "if the @xmath61 measurement in filter @xmath62 of the flux is @xmath63 with error @xmath64 , the multi - measurement , multi - filter analog of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : general_expanded ] is : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , and @xmath67 indicates an integration over the multi - dimensional parameter space where @xmath68 .",
    "the denominator is not parametrized by @xmath69 as it is not known what parameters are relevant for what we define as `` anything other than sne ia '' .",
    "therefore , every possible distribution of light in the filters is given an equal chance .",
    "we now address each term in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : terms ] in turn .",
    "@xmath70 + and @xmath71 are the likelihoods of obtaining a set of fluxes , @xmath72 , with uncertainties @xmath73 , for a number of measurements and filters , given that the mean number of photons are measured to be @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "assuming each measurement and every filter are independent , @xmath76 and @xmath77 note that , in general , the measured flux ( @xmath63 ) and the hypothesized flux ( @xmath78 ) have different subscripts ( which indicate the measurement number ) .",
    "this is done to emphasize the fact that it is unknown where the time of maximum of our measured light curve is relative to that of the model .",
    "this uncertainty is taken into account in one of the @xmath53 parameters , @xmath58 .",
    "the terms @xmath79 and @xmath80 in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : terms ] are prior probabilities . in particular , @xmath79 contains the prior knowledge about the parameters @xmath53 that describe an sn ia . for @xmath80 ,",
    "@xmath81 is not constrained .",
    "likewise , parameter @xmath19 is not constrained in any way for either a type ia or a non - ia prior .",
    "it is therefore marginalized . integrating over @xmath19 means integrating over the total light in all the filters and all the measurements for a given candidate  _",
    "i.e. _ , integrating over the observed magnitude for this measurement .",
    "furthermore , in marginalizing @xmath19 , there is an implicit assumption about the prior distribution of @xmath19  namely , that it is flat .",
    "this assumption allows us to formulate the probabilities purely in terms of color .",
    "allowing the total light to vary measurement - by - measurement with a flat prior is arguably the lightest possible assumption one can make regarding the magnitude .",
    "explicitly , the priors @xmath82 and @xmath83 become : @xmath84 since the only constraint here is that all the light fractions in different filters add up to one ; and @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a the prior probability of @xmath53 .    the priors on @xmath53 are defined similarly to those in  @xcite and are briefly summarized below .",
    "the stretch parameter @xmath55 follows a gaussian distribution with a mean of @xmath87 and a width of @xmath88 ( these values are extracted from  @xcite ) .",
    "the ccm parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 can assume two sets of values with equal probabilities : @xmath89 ( no extinction ) and @xmath90 ( moderate extinction ) .",
    "the prior probability for each choice of @xmath56 and @xmath57 is therefore @xmath91 .",
    "the parameter accounting for the difference between the time of maximum of the data and the model , @xmath58 , has a flat prior .",
    "the measured light curve is shifted relative to a template in one day increments 1000 times and each shift is assigned an equal probability @xmath92 .",
    "means that a flat prior is assigned to @xmath58 .",
    "finally , the redshift parameter @xmath59 is assumed to be known from the supernova candidate s host galaxy , @xmath93 , with an associated uncertainty of @xmath94 .",
    "we consider the range of redshifts from 0 to 1.7 , and assume two representative possibilities for @xmath94 , 0.005 ( which might be obtained through a spectroscopic analysis of the host galaxy s spectrum ) and 0.1 ( obtained through a photometric analysis ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath95    putting everything together , we obtain the full bayes factor :    @xmath96    where @xmath97 represents the sums and integrations over the parameters in @xmath69 ( depending on whether they are discrete or continuous ) .",
    "now the calculation of eqn .",
    "[ eqn : exact_r ] requires performing @xmath98 integrations over @xmath99 in the denominator . for a large number of filters ( say ,",
    "@xmath100 8) and many measurements , it is nearly impossible to do this calculation in a reasonable amount of time with the required precision for @xmath99 without the use of techniques such as markov chain monte carlo integration methods . however , the number of integrations can be reduced to @xmath48 ( the number of filters ) if we allow for measurement - to - measurement variations in @xmath19 .",
    "that is , if we allow @xmath101 @xmath102 can be brought inside the product over measurements .",
    "this assumption is the equivalent of removing the knowledge that the colors between the measurements are known ( or in the poisson case , this is equivalent to having a separate multinomial for each measurement ) .",
    "this effectively releases the constraint on colors between measurements .",
    "technically , the effect of this assumption should be to sweep more candidates which look less like sne ia into the sn ia hypothesis , so if one s sample contains `` anomalous '' candidates that very closely mimic sne ia one might reconsider this conjecture .    with eqn .",
    "[ eqn : b ] , eqn.[eqn : r_final ] becomes    @xmath103",
    "in order to check the performance of the method proposed above , we simulate a dataset closely mimicking one that could be obtained by a possible jdem space - based mission .",

    "@xmath114    several interesting conclusions can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : iaandii - p ] .",
    "first , it is apparent that the method does discriminate between sne ia and the other types , although log@xmath8 tend to be larger than 0 ( so that @xmath115 ) because sne ia are far more similar to other supernovae than they are to anything else .",
    "it should be noted that the values of @xmath8 tends to be quite large .",
    "this is due to our use of a large number of measurements ( @xmath116 50 ) in a number of filters , which ensures that a candidate is either very much identified as an sn ia - like candidate or not .",
    "second , as expected , the discrimination between sn ia s and non - ia s increases with more information ( 4 filters vs. 2 filters ) and/or with better prior knowledge ( _ i.e. _ , smaller errors on the measured redshift ) .",
    "third , the discrimination is somewhat worse at high redshifts ( @xmath111 @xmath1161 ) , as we move into a domain of less precise data and less certain models ; but it is still good enough for @xmath8 to be used as a first - pass sn ia classifier .",
    "additionally , at least some plausible jdems `` sculpt ''",
    "their expected sne ia distribution so that it peaks at @xmath59 @xmath116 0.7  @xcite .",
    "one might ask how @xmath8 would be affected if the templates used had incorrect colors for the sn ia hypothesis . in order to answer this question , we generated sn ia candidates with @xmath117 but use only the no - extinction templates when calculating @xmath8 .",
    "figure[fig : wrongdust ] shows the distributions of @xmath8 for the cases where the extinction parameters in the data and templates are matched and mis - matched .",
    "as expected , @xmath8 decreases when the extinction in the templates does not match that in the data ; that is , the sne ia look more similar to non - sne ia .",
    "= 3.0 in    we further check the behavior of @xmath8 by varying the errors on the fluxes of the simulated sne ia to ensure that @xmath8 changes in the right direction .",
    "this check , always a good idea for a newly introduced statistic , is particularly important for this bayes factor , which makes use of improper priors that can lead to non - intuitive behavior (  @xcite ) .",

    "= 3.0 in      so far , we have assumed no prior knowledge of sne models that may contribute to the set of observed non - sne ia .",
    "we showed that the bayes factor described above is capable of discriminating between sne ia and non - sne ia as well as random unimodal light curves that mimic anomalous candidates .",
    "this discrimination , which does not require either the knowledge of a complete set of objects that can mimic an sn ia signal or the knowledge of the possible behavior of anomalous non - supernova objects that can contaminate an sn ia signal , is good . as fig.[fig : iaandii - p ] shows , we could simply define a polynomial cut on @xmath8 as a function of @xmath8 and have a very good discriminant .",
    "however , one might be interested in considering a bayes factor for which all _ known _ non - sn ia candidates would have @xmath113 .",
    "first , it is simply better to have a @xmath8 that behaves intuitively .",
    "second , it is obvious that including more prior knowledge ( _ i.e. _ , the knowledge of what can potentially mimic an sn ia signal ) , can only sharpen the discrimination between sne ia and non - sne ia .",
    "third , and more importantly , it is a good idea to have a discriminant such that @xmath8 @xmath118 1 when the candidate is more likely to be an sn ia than not , and @xmath8 @xmath111 1 otherwise .",
    "this allows one to use a formalism similar to that described in  @xcite in order to set thresholds on @xmath8 with meaningful , pre - determined type i and ii error rates .    explicitly including the knowledge about the behavior of non - sne ia into eqn .",
    "[ eqn : general ] , we define :    @xmath119    where the denominator now accounts for the probability that the observed photometry can come from a type ii - p supernova , @xmath120 ; a type ibc supernova , @xmath121 ; or from a type iin supernova , @xmath122 .",
    "@xmath123 is equivalent to the denominator in eqn.[eqn : r_final2 ] .",
    "note that the prior terms in eqn .",
    "[ eqn : general2 ] are such that @xmath124 in other words , there is an equal probability of measuring a type ia supernova , a type ibc supernova , a type ii - p supernova or some other object denoted as `` anything '' .",
    "it is of course trivial to introduce relative rates if they are known ; however , it is immaterial for our purpose , which is demonstrating the performance of the method .",
    "the non - type ia probabilities are calculated in exactly the same way as those for type ia s , using the available models for the corresponding types .",
    "the distribution of @xmath125 vs. redshift in shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iaandii - ppriorknowledge ] , for the case of 2 filters ( left column ) and 4 ( right column ) filters with 0.005 flux errors ( bottom row ) , and 0.1 errors ( top row ) on the redshift .",
    "randomly generated , uni - modal data all have large negative values @xmath126 s that dwarf the scales on these figures .",
    "the errors on the flux are those expected for a jdem mission described above . compared fig .",
    "[ fig : iaandii - ppriorknowledge ] to fig.[fig : iaandii - p ] , it is clear that not only has the discrimination between sne ia and everything else increased , but also the sne ia generally have @xmath127 and other candidates have @xmath128 .",
    "this is the desired behavior for @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath130    a number of features of fig .",
    "[ fig : iaandii - ppriorknowledge ] are similar to those apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : iaandii - p ] , such as the increase in the discrimination power when more and/or better information becomes available .      as we explained in section  [ section : intro ] , existing bayesian - based methods of supernova classification assume a finite set of possible objects that can mimic an sn ia signal . to demonstrate",
    "the danger of this limiting assumption , we use our unimodal fake light curves and calculate bayes factors defined as :    @xmath131    and    @xmath132    figure[fig : naive ] shows that the fake objects can be mis - identified as supernovae of types other than ia ( in particular , as type ii - p s ) , as well as sne ia : there are candidates with @xmath133 @xmath111 1 .",
    "this further demonstrates the need for a general a formalism that is capable of discriminating a certain type of supernovae ( most often type ia s ) from _ anything else_.    = 4.0 in + = 4.0 in",
    "we have introduced a new photometric supernova classification scheme that uses a bayes factor based on color .",
    "the proposed method is fundamentally different from previous supernova classification methods including our own  @xcite because it allows one to discriminate not only between supernovae of different types but also between supernovae and `` anomalous '' objects .",
    "it has a number of definite advantages over many existing techniques for selecting sne ia out of a pool of supernova candidates .",
    "the main one is that it does not pre - suppose any prior knowledge about the objects that could potentially mimic a type ia signal .",
    "it can thus be used as a very good first - pass type ia classifier . with the current poor knowledge of the behavior of non - type ia supernovae , especially at high redshifts , and the expected dramatic increase in the discoveries of new , as yet unknown classes of transient astronomical objects",
    ", this feature of the method will be invaluable for future supernova surveys .",
    "this is not , however , an excuse not to obtain as much information about non - type ia supernovae as one possibly can , as evidenced by the advantage of computing @xmath134 , which includes information about the light curves of type ia , ibc , iin , and ii - p supernovae ( obviously , more information means a better performance ) .",
    "another principal advantage of the proposed method is that if the bayes factor described in section  [ section : results ] is used as a discriminant , the only supernova models that are required are those for sne ia , which are the best studied and most complete of all the supernova types .",
    "one may argue that the same is true for a @xmath0-based method .",
    "however , @xmath0 methods suffer from a number of problems described in section[section : intro ] , the least of which is that for the case of data with large uncertainties a given supernova candidate will appear to agree with many possible supernova type hypotheses , with one necessarily giving the `` best '' @xmath0 ( however insignificant the difference between this best @xmath0 and the @xmath0 s from the other fits may be ) .",
    "the bayes factor , on the other hand , would be of order 1 , reflecting ambiguity between the hypothesis that the candidate is an sn ia and that it is anything else",
    ".    finally , as it is a bayesian approach , it accounts for all systematic and statistical uncertainties of the measurements in all their forms .",
    "we demonstrated the method on a simulated dataset expected from a possible future large - scale space - based jdem .",
    "it must be noted that most existing data sets include primarily sne ia ; at the present time large datasets with exotic supernovae that would allow us to perform a statistically meaningful study of the method s performance are not available ( although we are planning on exploring the application of this method to an existing dataset of non - standard supernovae in a future publication ) .",
    "nevertheless , a number of interesting conclusions can be drawn from the simulation studies described above :    * the method provides a 100% discrimination between sne ia and unimodal random data .",
    "this is encouraging , since many transient objects ( such as active galactic nuclei ) that are sometimes mistaken for supernovae tend to have a rather erratic behavior , deviating far more from an sn ia light curve than the simple random unimodal data .",
    "more fundamentally , the discrimination also shows that @xmath8 and @xmath134 behave as expected . *",
    "the discrimination between type ia s and other supernova types is near 100% at low redshifts when calculating log@xmath8 . at higher redshifts , fig .",
    "[ fig : iaandii - p ] shows that that a `` straight line '' cut on @xmath112 would render a reasonably high purity and efficiency for sne ia .",
    "alternatively , one could invent a more sophisticated cut ( _ e.g. _ , a polynomial ) .",
    "the discrimination is practically 100% at all redshifts if log@xmath134 is used ( _ i.e. _ , when information about the behavior of type ii - p , type ibc , and type iin supernovae is included in calculating @xmath3 ) . *",
    "the method performs better when more information about the data becomes available . for example , the discrimination between sne ia and non - sne ia increases dramatically when the number of filters goes from 2 to 4 .",
    "this shows that , despite the use of improper priors , the bayes factor behaves properly . *",
    "increasing the precision on the redshift of the supernova candidates also improves the discrimination between type ia s and non - sne ia . *",
    "it is important that the data and the models used have a good match in terms of expected colors .",
    "for example , if the extinction assumptions in the data are different from those in the data , real sne ia are more likely to be classified as anomalous objects .",
    "* figures[fig : iaandii - p ] and [ fig : iaandii - ppriorknowledge ] indicate that there is sufficient separation between various supernova candidates , so that this method could be used for classification in the strict sense of giving a type ( _ e.g. _ , a type ia , a type ibc , _ etc . _ ) to each candidate , along with some associated probability .",
    "the method does not make use of magnitudes .",
    "one might see this as an advantage if one does not entirely trust the distribution of intrinsic magnitudes .",
    "insertion of absolute magnitudes is possible , but the formulation of @xmath8 ( @xmath134 ) becomes inelegant and requires knowledge of an upper limit of intrinsic magnitudes of anomalous candidates that , by definition , have not been observed .",
    "it is indeed fortunate that color alone is sufficient to classify supernovae , allowing for a simple and elegant solution for @xmath8 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "there is another reason not to include magnitudes into the formalism , at least at the present time .",
    "the distributions of the intrinsic magnitudes for non - sne ia are at the moment rather poorly known  @xcite .",
    "in fact , very little is known about high - redshift non - sne ia ( for example ,  @xcite remains the only measurement of the non - sne ia rates to redshifts of @xmath116 1 ) .",
    "there exists a very real need to measure the properties of non - sne ia supernovae with more precision , a task that is ideally suited for existing and planned large - scale supernova surveys .",
    "it is also important to note the computational challenges in calculating @xmath8 ( @xmath134 ) .",
    "the number of filters used in the calculation depends on the precision needed for the integration of @xmath135 .",
    "it was found that for 4 filters about 150 integration points for @xmath136 were needed for a precise calculation of the denominator , @xmath3 .",
    "this was found by increasing the number of integration points until the value of the denominator became stable .    in order to complete the computations in a reasonable amount of time",
    ", it was necessary to perform the calculations of the bayes factor for many candidates in parallel .",
    "the computational feasibility also depended on approximating @xmath137 , as was discussed in section  [ section : details ] , so as to reduce the number of integrations from @xmath138 ( where @xmath47 is the number of flux measurements and @xmath48 is the number of filters ) to @xmath48 .",
    "this effectively required that we gave up information about the supernova colors measured in the various filters and allowed the colors to vary measurement - to - measurement .",
    "one might be concerned that this approximation would in fact allow for a greater diversity in what is considered an sn ia  that is , in general objects would have a greater chance of faking an sn ia . however , in our studies we found that , at least with the level of precision of the models and simulated data used , the calculated bayes factor provided desired discrimination between sne ia and other objects , leading us to believe that this is not a significant effect .",
    "we also point out that our proposed technique is general enough to be used for objects other than supernovae .",
    "for example ,  @xcite propose a bayesian classifier to differentiate quasars and stars , defined as : @xmath139 where @xmath140 is a candidate s position in a 4-dimensional color space .",
    "although the likelihoods , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are obtained using a training sample derived from real data , new data inevitably bring new objects which could be accounted for by inserting an `` anomaly '' term similar to @xmath143 in eqn.[eqn : general2 ] .",
    "this term would sweep up those objects that do not conform to the existing models for quasars or stars in the same way that @xmath143 accounts for anomalous supernova candidates ; its exact form would depend on the nature of the statistical fluctuations in the data .",
    "note that while our method relies only on photometric information about supernovae , some proposed future space - based dark energy missions do plan on obtaining the spectrum of every candidate .",
    "one possible scenario would be to obtain the spectrum of a candidate provided that a ) it is highly likely to be an sn ia , and b ) it is at its peak brightness . in this case",
    "it is necessary to have reliable means to be able to tell whether or not a given candidate is most likely an sn ia or not based on its pre - maximum photometric measurements alone . in other words , it is important to have a _ trigger _ mechanism that would photometrically select candidates for possible spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "our proposed bayes factor can be simply modified to allow for such a usage . assuming that one wants to trigger on supernovae before maximum brightness , the bayes factor becomes :    @xmath144    where @xmath145 would only include supernova models with points before maximum light , while @xmath146 would only include those with points after maximum light .",
    "after calculating this bayes factor , a cut would be made at , say , @xmath147 to choose those candidates that are likely to be sne ia and that have not yet reached maximum .",
    "better still , one could use a _ sequential analysis _",
    "technique  @xcite to minimize the data required to make this decision while simultaneously controlling identification errors .",
    "this is done by setting thresholds on @xmath148 based on pre - selected type i and type ii error rates",
    ". the demonstration of the performance of a sequential analysis - based approach will be the subject of a future publication .",
