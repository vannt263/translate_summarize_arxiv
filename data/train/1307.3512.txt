    "the discussed phase slips , however , exists for any arbitrary junction geometry .",

    ". therefore , we get that the superconducting phase must undergo a @xmath0 slip to minimize the josephson coupling energy whenever the integral @xmath79 changes sign as a function of the magnetic field .",
    "we shall conclude by discussing the pure _ antisymmetric _ junction case , i.e. , @xmath82 and @xmath105 . because of the zero current condition the only values that the phase @xmath52 can assume are @xmath106 or @xmath107 .",

    "we remark that the discussed phase slips differ from those present in low dimensional superconductors , caused by thermal @xcite and quantum @xcite fluctuations . in those cases ,",
    "the phase slips are generated when , because of fluctuations , the modulus of the complex order parameter goes to zero , the phase becomes unrestricted and jumps of @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "by contrast , the phase slips discussed above have an energetic origin and they occur when the system passes from one energetically stable configuration to another one @xcite .",
    "this transition takes place when the magnetic flux crosses one of the critical points and therefore can be experimentally induced by changing the magnetic flux .",
    "the different origin of the slips is exemplified by the fact that the fluctuation - induced phase slips are always of @xmath112 while in the present case we have slips of @xmath0 .",
    "the identification of this effect is possible only in the electrically - open junctions .",
