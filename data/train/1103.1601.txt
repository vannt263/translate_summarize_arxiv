    "recall the famous property r theorem , proven in a somewhat stronger form by david gabai @xcite :    [ thm : propr ] if @xmath2-framed surgery on a knot @xmath3 yields @xmath4 then @xmath5 is the unknot .",

    "although this generalized property  r conjecture can be traced back more than two decades , it seems that no progress has appeared in the literature until now .",
    "the present paper studies the conjecture , focusing on the case of 2-component links .",
    "we conclude that the conjecture is probably false , and analyze potential counterexamples .",
    "these examples have relevance to the slice - ribbon conjecture .",
    "we also propose a weaker version of the generalized property  r conjecture that seems much more likely , and is related to the 4-dimensional smooth poincar conjecture .",
    "we concentrate on links @xmath9 where @xmath10 is fibered .",
    "critical to the argument are developments in sutured manifold theory , developments that go beyond those used by gabai in his original proof of property r. in particular we use sutured manifold theory to show ( theorem  [ thm : main ] ) that any counterexample of this form to the generalized property  r conjecture generates another 2-component counterexample for which one component has smaller genus than @xmath10 . with this motivation , we assume @xmath10 has genus  2 .",
    "we then use heegaard theory to completely characterize such links @xmath7 satisfying the hypothesis of the generalized property  r conjecture ( corollary  [ cor : genustwo ] ) : after handle slides , @xmath11 is a special type of curve lying on the fiber of @xmath10 . for the simplest plausible @xmath10 , namely the square knot , this characterization becomes simple enough ( corollary  [ cor : enumerate ] ) to allow enumeration of all examples up to handle slides .",

    "we will see ( section  [ slice ] ) that this link and its generalizations @xmath20 ( figure  [ fig : lnk ] ) are necessarily slice , so we can generate slice knots just by band - summing the two components together . for @xmath19 there is no apparent reason for the resulting knots to be ribbon .",

    "( in an arbitrary @xmath23-manifold @xmath24 a knot may not have a naturally defined longitude . ) surgery on the link via the framing is standard dehn surgery , though restricted to integral coefficients : a regular neighborhood of each component is removed and then reattached so that the meridian is identified with the cross - section given by the framing .",

    "there is a straightforward @xmath22-dimensional proof , using the intersection pairing on the trace of the surgery .",
    "here is an equally elementary @xmath23-dimensional proof :    [ prop : frame ] suppose @xmath7 is a framed link of @xmath52 components in @xmath53 , and surgery on @xmath7 via the specified framing yields @xmath51 .",
    "then the components of @xmath7 are algebraically unlinked and the framing on each component is the @xmath2-framing .",
    "it follows immediately from alexander duality that @xmath56 in particular , filling in the solid tori via whatever framing we are given yields an epimorphism , hence an isomorphism @xmath57 . for each torus component @xmath58 of @xmath59 ,",
    "the filling will kill some generator of @xmath60 , so the homomorphism @xmath61 is not injective .",
    "it follows that the homomorphism @xmath62 can not be injective and , moreover , @xmath63 must contain the framing curve .",
    "but @xmath63 must be contained in the subgroup generated by the standard longitude , since this is the only subgroup that is trivial when the other components of @xmath64 are just left in place and not removed from @xmath53 .",
    "it follows that the framing at each component is that of the standard longitude , namely the @xmath2-framing .",
    "since the longitude of each @xmath58 is null - homologous in @xmath65 it follows that all linking numbers are trivial .",
    "there is also an immediate topological restriction on the link itself , which carries over to a restriction on the knots that can appear as individual components of such a link ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) ) :    [ prop : slice ] suppose @xmath7 is a framed link of @xmath52 components in @xmath53 , and surgery on @xmath7 via the specified framing yields @xmath51",
    ". then @xmath7 bounds a collection of @xmath6 smooth @xmath0-disks in a @xmath22-dimensional homotopy ball bounded by @xmath53 .",
    "it follows from freedman s proof of the @xmath22-dimensional topological poincar conjecture @xcite that @xmath7 ( and so each component of @xmath7 ) is topologically slice in @xmath66 .",
    "see also the earlier @xcite for the case @xmath54 .",

    "@xmath68 has one end diffeomorphic to @xmath53 and the other end , call it @xmath69 , diffeomorphic to @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath67 has the homotopy type of a once - punctured @xmath70 .",
    "attach @xmath71 to @xmath69 via the natural identification @xmath72 .",
    "the result is a homotopy @xmath22-ball , and the cores of the original @xmath6 @xmath0-handles that are attached to @xmath7 are the required @xmath6 @xmath0-disks .    somewhat playfully , we can turn the generalized property r conjecture , which is a conjecture about links , into a conjecture about knots , and also stratify it by the number of components , via the following definition and conjecture .",
    "a knot @xmath3 has * property nr * if it does not appear among the components of any @xmath6-component counterexamples to the generalized property r conjecture .",
    "that is , whenever @xmath5 is a component of an n - component link @xmath73 and some integral surgery on @xmath7 produces @xmath51 , then there is a sequence of handle slides on @xmath7 that converts @xmath7 into a @xmath2-framed unlink .",
    "all knots have property nr .",
    "thus the generalized property r conjecture is that the property nr conjecture is true for all @xmath52 .",
    "following proposition [ prop : slice ] any non - slice knot has property nr for all @xmath6 .",
    "the first thing that we will show ( theorem [ thm : main ] ) is that if there are any counterexamples to property  2r , a least genus such example can not be fibered .",
    "we already know that both of the genus one fibered knots ( the figure 8 knot and the trefoil ) can not be counterexamples , since they are not slice , and we show below ( proposition [ prop : unknot ] ) that the unknot can not be a counterexample .",
    "so these simplest of fibered knots do have property  2r .",
    "these considerations suggest that , if one is searching for a potential counterexample to property nr and hope to exploit a knot s geometric properties , the simplest candidate could be the square knot , viewed as a potential counterexample to property  2r .",
    "after all , the square knot is symmetric , slice , fibered , and both its genus and its crossing number are low .",
    "in fact it turns out that there is a relatively simple range of possibilities for what a @xmath0-component link containing the square knot and surgering to @xmath1 can look like .",
    "the background for this comes from the theory of heegaard splittings and is discussed in sections [ sect : heeg ] and [ sect : squareknot ] . in section [",
    "sect : nonstandard ] we present strong evidence that property  2r does indeed fail for the square knot .",
    "since the square knot is fibered , it would then follow from theorem [ thm : main ] that there is a counterexample to property  2r among genus one knots .",
    "on the other hand , the square knot may well satisfy a somewhat weaker property , which is still useful in the connection of property  r to such outstanding @xmath22-manifold questions as the smooth poincar conjecture and the smooth schoenflies conjecture .",
    "for this weaker property , copies of canceling hopf pairs may be added to the link before the handle slides and then removed after the handle slides . beyond our specific example",
    ", we discuss the mechanics of how addition and later removal of a hopf pair can be used to reduce the complexity of a surgery description .",
    "almost nothing is known about generalized property r , beyond the elementary facts noted in propositions [ prop : frame ] and [ prop : slice ] that the framing and linking of the components of the link are all trivial and the links themselves are slice in a possibly exotic ball . a bit more is known about property  2r .",
    "the first proposition was shown to us by alan reid :    suppose @xmath73 is a @xmath0-component link with tunnel number @xmath74 .",
    "if surgery on @xmath7 gives @xmath1 then @xmath7 is the unlink of two components .",
    "the assumption that @xmath7 has tunnel number @xmath74 means that there is a properly embedded arc @xmath75 so that @xmath76 is a genus @xmath0 handlebody @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 .",
    "there is an obvious epimorphism @xmath79 ( fill in a meridian disk of @xmath80 ) and an obvious epimorphism @xmath81 ( fill in solid tori via the given framing ) .",
    "but any epimorphism @xmath82 is an isomorphism , since free groups are hopfian , so in fact @xmath83 .",
    "it is then a classical result that @xmath7 must be the unlink of two components .",
    "this first step towards the property  2r conjecture is a bit disappointing , however , since handle - slides ( the new and necessary ingredient for generalized property r ) do not arise .",
    "in contrast , figure [ fig : squareknot ] shows that handle slides are needed in the proof of the following :    [ prop : unknot ] the unknot has property 2r .",
    "suppose @xmath7 is the union of two components , the unknot @xmath10 and another knot @xmath11 , and suppose some surgery on @xmath7 gives @xmath1 .",
    "following proposition [ prop : frame ] the surgery is via the @xmath2-framing on each and , since @xmath10 is the unknot , @xmath2-framed surgery on @xmath10 alone creates @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , the curve @xmath84 that is dual to @xmath10 is simply @xmath85 for some point @xmath86 .",
    "a first possibility is that @xmath11 is a satellite knot in @xmath4 , so @xmath11 lies in a solid torus @xmath5 in such a way that the torus @xmath87 is essential in @xmath88 .",
    "since there is no essential torus in @xmath1 , @xmath87 compresses after the surgery on @xmath11 . since @xmath1 contains no summand with finite non - trivial homology , it follows from the main theorem of @xcite that @xmath11 is a braid in @xmath5 and that surgery on @xmath11 has the same effect on @xmath4 as some surgery on @xmath5 .",
    "proposition [ prop : frame ] shows that the surgery on @xmath5 must be along a longitude of @xmath5 , but that would imply that @xmath11 has winding number @xmath74 in @xmath5 .",
    "the only braid in a solid torus with winding number @xmath74 is the core of the solid torus , so in fact @xmath11 is merely a core of @xmath5 and no satellite .",
    "so we conclude that @xmath89 can not be a satellite knot .",
    "consider the manifold @xmath88 .",
    "if it is irreducible , then it is a taut sutured manifold ( see , for example , @xcite ) and two different fillings ( trivial vs. @xmath2-framed ) along @xmath90 yield reducible , hence non - taut sutured manifolds .",
    "this contradicts @xcite .",
    "we conclude that @xmath88 is reducible .",
    "it follows that @xmath11 is isotopic to a knot @xmath91 lying in a @xmath23-ball in @xmath92 and that surgery on @xmath93 creates a summand of the form @xmath4 . by property r , we know that @xmath91 is the unknot in @xmath94 .",
    "hence @xmath95 is the unlink of two components .",
    "the proof , though , is not yet complete , because the isotopy of @xmath11 to @xmath91 in @xmath4 may pass through @xmath44 .",
    "but passing @xmath11 through @xmath84 can be viewed as band - summing @xmath11 to the boundary of a meridian disk of @xmath44 in @xmath4 .",
    "so the effect back in @xmath53 is to replace @xmath11 with the band sum of @xmath11 with a longitude of @xmath10 . in other words ,",
    "the knot @xmath91 , when viewed in @xmath53 , is obtained by from @xmath11 by a series of handle slides over @xmath10 , a move that is permitted under generalized property r.    in a similar spirit , the first goal of the present paper is to prove a modest generalization of proposition [ prop : unknot ] .",
    "a pleasant feature is that , since the square knot is fibered , figure [ fig : squareknot2b ] shows that the proof will require handle slides of _ both _ components of the link .",
    "[ thm : main ] no smallest genus counterexample to property 2r is fibered .",
    "echoing the notation of proposition [ prop : unknot ] , suppose there is a @xmath0-component counterexample to generalized property r consisting of a fibered knot @xmath10 and another knot @xmath11 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the @xmath23-manifold obtained by @xmath2-framed surgery on @xmath10 alone ; @xmath24 will play the role that @xmath4 played in the proof of proposition [ prop : unknot ] . since @xmath10 is a fibered knot , @xmath24 fibers over the circle with fiber @xmath96 , a closed orientable surface of the same genus as @xmath10 . the dual to @xmath10 in @xmath24 is a knot @xmath44 that passes through each fiber exactly once .",
    "the hypothesis is that @xmath2-framed surgery on @xmath97 creates @xmath1 . following ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corollary 4.2 ) , either the knot @xmath11 lies in a ball , or @xmath11 is cabled with the surgery slope that of the cabling annulus , or @xmath11 can be isotoped in @xmath24 to lie in a fiber , with surgery slope that of the fiber .",
    "if @xmath11 were cabled , then the surgery on @xmath5 would create a lens space summand , which is clearly impossible in @xmath51 .",
    "if @xmath11 can be isotoped into a ball or into a fiber , then , as argued in the proof of proposition [ prop : unknot ] , the isotopy in @xmath24 is realized in @xmath53 by handle - slides of @xmath11 over @xmath10 , so we may as well regard @xmath11 as lying either in a ball that is disjoint from @xmath44 or in a fiber @xmath98 . the former case , @xmath11 in a ball disjoint from @xmath44 would , as in proposition [ prop : unknot ] , imply that the link @xmath99 is the unlink .",
    "so we can assume that @xmath100 .",
    "the surgery on @xmath11 that changes @xmath24 to @xmath1 has this local effect near @xmath96 : @xmath24 is cut open along @xmath96 , creating two copies @xmath101 of @xmath96 , a @xmath0-handle is attached to the copy of @xmath11 in each @xmath102 , compressing the copies of the fiber to surfaces @xmath103 .",

    "the knot @xmath31 , still a counterexample to property  2r , has @xmath114 as required .",

    "much of this section in fact considers the more general question of when @xmath1 can be created by surgery on a knot in a @xmath23-manifold @xmath24 that fibers over a circle .",
    "the application to property  2r comes from the special case in which the manifold @xmath24 is obtained from @xmath2-framed surgery on a fibered knot in @xmath53 .",

    "this plane bisects both @xmath465 twist boxes and contains @xmath405 .",
    "we interpret this plane as a 2-sphere in the background @xmath53 .",
    "surgery on @xmath405 splits the sphere into a disjoint pair of spheres .",
    "neither of these lies in @xmath28 since each is punctured by both bracketed circles .",
    "however , we can remove the punctures by tubing the spheres together along both bracketed curves , obtaining an embedded torus in @xmath28 .",
    "the fibers @xmath429 of this torus include a meridian of each bracketed circle , and the torus induces the 0-framing on these relative to the background @xmath53 .",
    "to see these in @xmath24 , ignore the link @xmath444 and unwind the bracketed link .",
    "blowing down reveals the 0-framed meridian of the @xmath466$]-framed curve to be a @xmath296-framed unknot in @xmath24 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* figure 5.18 ) ) .",
    "thus , we can choose either meridian to be @xmath449 , with framing @xmath457 in @xmath24 , i.e. , @xmath296 in @xmath53 .",
    "( in either case , the framing in @xmath53 is preserved as we travel around the torus , so it becomes 0 in @xmath24 when we reach the other meridian , showing that we can not get off the ride in the middle . ) since @xmath440 intersects the torus at two points , at the @xmath465-twist boxes , it is easy to verify that the procedure turns @xmath458 into @xmath467 , with the sign depending both on the choice of @xmath449 and the direction of motion around the torus",
    ". it is instructive to view the procedure explicitly as a sequence of four handle slides in figure  [ fig : gompf6 ] .",
    "it is not completely obvious how to trivialize the link by handle slides when @xmath464 . in the @xmath366 case , figures [ fig : gompffig4 ] and [ fig : gompffig5 ] isotope the link to figure [ fig : squareknot ] , solving the problem with a single handle slide . for general @xmath347 ,",
    "it is helpful to begin from a somewhat simpler picture of @xmath20 , figure  [ fig : example ] , which is obtained from figure [ fig : gompf6 ] by an isotopy that rotates both @xmath468 twist boxes 180 degrees outward about vertical axes .",
    "now set @xmath469 and consider the two handle slides in figure  [ fig : example2 ] ( following the arrows , framed by the plane of the paper ) .",
    "the slides first complicate @xmath405 , but after an isotopy shrinking the strands shown in green , @xmath405 simplifies , so that a slide over the @xmath350$]-framed circle changes it to a meridian of the @xmath354$]-framed circle .",
    "the @xmath468-twist boxes then cancel , showing that the link is trivial .",
    "this construction was derived from the dual construction in @xcite , showing that the relevant homotopy balls are standard by introducing a canceling 2-handle/3-handle pair . while it was not easy to explicitly dualize the construction , in the end the two constructions appear rather similar .",
    "the construction in @xcite also involves introducing a new link component and moving it around a torus . in that case , the new component was a 0-framed unknot , the attaching circle of the new 2-handle .",
    "akbulut s recent proof @xcite that infinitely many cappell - shaneson homotopy 4-spheres are standard again relies on such a trick . in each case",
    ", the key seems to be an embedded torus with trivial normal bundle , to which a 2-handle is attached with framing @xmath296 , forming a _",
    "fishtail neighborhood_. this neighborhood has self - diffeomorphisms that can undo certain cut - and - paste operations on the 4-manifold , as we implicitly saw in the case of proposition  [ prop : ln ] with @xmath430 an embedding .",
    "while this procedure has been known in a different context for at least three decades , underlying the proof that simply connected elliptic surfaces with fixed @xmath470 are determined by their multiplicities , it still appears to be underused .",
    "in fact , one can obtain a simpler and more general proof that many cappell - shaneson 4-spheres are standard by going back to their original definition and directly locating fishtail neighborhoods @xcite ."
