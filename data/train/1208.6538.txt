    "gamow - teller ( gt ) electron capture ( @xmath2-decay ) transitions , caused by the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) operator , are some of the most important nuclear weak processes in astrophysics . for a review of spin - isospin transitions",
    "@xcite . the gt transitions in @xmath5-shell nuclei play important roles at the core collapse stages of supernovae ,",
    "specially in neutrino induced processes .",
    "one of the factors controlling the gravitational core - collapse of massive stars is the lepton fraction ; the lepton fraction in turn is governed by @xmath2-decay and electron capture rates among iron - regime nuclides .",
    "a primary and non - trivial contribution to the weak rates is the distribution of gt strength .",
    "gt strengths have important implications in other astrophysical scenarios as well , such as explosive nucleosynthesis in o - ne - mg white dwarfs ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "gt distributions have been extracted experimentally using different techniques . whereas the @xmath2-decay extraction is done in a model independent manner and",
    "are used to calibrate the b(gt ) , the charge - exchange reactions require further assumptions and the resulting extraction of gt distributions can not be truly done in a model - independent manner .",
    "consequently astrophysical calculations rely either upon crude estimates or upon more detailed microscopic calculations .",
    "the main difficulty with both experiment and theory is that the strength distribution connects to many states .",
    "further in astrophysical environments one needs finite temperature gt strength functions as the temperature is high enough for excited states in the parent to be thermally populated .",
    "the isovector response of nuclei may be studied using the nucleon charge - exchange reactions @xmath6 or @xmath7 ; by other reactions such as @xmath8he,@xmath9 ) , ( @xmath10he ) or through heavy ion reactions .",
    "the @xmath11 gt cross sections ( @xmath12 excitations ) are proportional to the analogous beta - decay strengths .",
    "charge - exchange reactions at small momentum transfer can therefore be used to study beta - decay strength distributions when beta - decay is not energetically possible .",
    "the @xmath6 , @xmath8he,@xmath13 reactions probe the gt@xmath14 strength ( corresponding to @xmath15-decay ) and the @xmath7 , @xmath16he ) reactions give the strength for @xmath17-decay / electron capture , i.e. gt@xmath18 strength .",
    "the study of @xmath6 reactions has the advantage over @xmath2-decay measurements in that the gt@xmath14 strength can be investigated over a large region of excitation energy in the residual nucleus . on the other hand the @xmath7 reactions populates only @xmath19 states in all nuclei heavier than @xmath20he .",
    "this means that other final states ( including the isobaric analog resonance ) are forbidden and gt@xmath18 transitions can be observed relatively free of background .",
    "the study of these reactions suggest that a reduction in the amount of gt strength is observed relative to theoretical calculations .",
    "the gt quenching is on the order of 30 - 40 @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "theory for gt transitions falls generally into three camps : simple independent - particle models ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; full - scale interacting shell - model calculations ; and , in between , the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) and quasi - particle random - phase approximation ( qrpa ) .",
    "independent - particle models underestimate the the total gt strength , because the fermi surface is insufficiently fragmented , while also placing the centroid of the gt strength too high for even - even parent nuclides and too low on odd - a and odd - odd parents @xcite .",
    "full interacting shell - model calculations are computationally demanding , although one can exploit the lanczos algorithm , commonly used in large shell - model diagonalization @xcite , to efficiently generate the strength distribution @xcite ; for medium - mass nuclei one still needs to choose from among a number of competing semi - realistic / semi - empirical interactions .",
    "rpa and qrpa can be thought of as approximations to a full shell - model calculation and are much less demanding computationally .    in this paper",
    "we compare gt strength distributions for a suite of iron - region nuclides relevant to astrophysics : @xmath22fe , and @xmath23ni . for each of these nuclides",
    "we compute the gt strengths in several rpa calculations .",
    "each rpa calculation is in occupation rather than configuration space , which is appropriate inasmuch as the gt operator only affects spin and isospin .",
    "( in fact each calculation properly speaking is proton - neutron rpa or qrpa , as the rpa / qrpa phonon operators change protons into neutrons or vice - versa . )",
    "the calculations , which will be described in greater detail in subsequent sections , are :    @xmath24 pn - rpa in a major harmonic oscillator shell , that is , the @xmath0-@xmath1 shell , with three different semi - realistic / semi - empirical interactions @xcite . for details see section 2 .",
    "@xmath24 pn - qrpa in a multi - shell single - particle space with a schematic interaction that has been previously applied to similar calculations @xcite . for further details",
    "we refer to section 3 .",
    "these particular calculations were chosen because of the availability of codes ; one could imagine a larger set of calculations ( e.g. , pn - qrpa with semi - realistic interactions ) but relevant codes either do not exist or are not available to us .    these calculations will help to understand systematic similarities and differences between ( a ) different @xmath0-@xmath1 shell - model interactions and ( b ) between @xmath25 shell - model calculations against multi - shell calculations with a separable interaction .",
    "for example , for some cases in the @xmath26-@xmath27 shell the separable interactions yield a larger total strength and a higher centroid @xcite than shell - model calculations .",
    "section  4 presents the results and discussions on use of various pn - rpa schemes .",
    "we finally present the summary and conclusions in section  5 .",
    "the configuration - interaction ( ci ) shell model solves the many - body problem in a large basis of slater determinants using the occupation representation .",
    "one advantage of the ci shell model is that it can use arbitrary two - body ( or even higher - order ) interactions and gives explicit wavefunctions for excited states as well as the ground state .",
    "in addition , because the gt operator is @xmath28 and does not affect coordinate space wavefunctions , the ci shell model is well suited for gt transitions .",
    "the drawback of the ci shell model is that even with including just a few , or even one , harmonic oscillator shell , the basis dimensions can be huge ( @xmath29 or greater ) , making such calculations computationally intensive .",
    "furthermore , limiting calculations to a few shells leads to the necessity for quenching ( in the case of gamow - teller transitions ) or enhancement ( for example , e2 transitions ) of coupling parameters .",
    "the hamiltonian for the shell - model is written in occupation space@xcite , i.e. , @xmath30 where the creation and annihilation operators @xmath31 represent single - particle states with good angular momentum , and where @xmath32 are the single particle energies and @xmath33 are the two - body matrix elements .",
    "it is possible to solve the rpa matrix equation in a shell - model representation , using the single - particle energies and two - body matrix elements above .",
    "a recent series of papers showed that rpa is a reasonable , if not perfect , approximation to the numerically exact results , comparing ground state correlation energies @xcite and charge - conserving @xcite and charge - changing @xcite transitions ; in the last case it was found that allowing the hartree - fock state to be deformed improved pn - rpa calculations of gt strength distributions .",
    "the first step is a hartree - fock calculation , which introduces a unitary transformation on the single - particle states , @xmath34 these states are divided into occupied ( hole ) states , labeled by @xmath35 , and unoccupied ( particle ) states labeled by @xmath36 , and the transformation matrix @xmath37 is chosen such that the energy of the slater determinant @xmath38 minimizes the energy @xmath39 .    with the hartree - fock solution in hand",
    ", one finds excited states ( and the correlation energy in the ground state , although that does not concern us here ) by treating the energy surface in the vicinity of the hartree - fock state as quadratic .",
    "this leads to the rpa matrix equations @xcite . for charge - changing interactions such as gamow - teller",
    ", the rpa matrix equations take the form : @xmath40 where the definitions for @xmath41 and @xmath42 matrices are similar to the regular proton - neutron conserving formalism , where one approximates @xmath43|",

    "let @xmath47 , @xmath48 be number of proton particle and hole states , respectively , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 the number of neutron particle and hole states .",
    "thus the vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 are of length @xmath53 while vectors @xmath54 , @xmath55 are of length @xmath56 ; the two lengths are unequal unless @xmath46 .",
    "similarly , @xmath57 is a square matrix of dimension @xmath53 while @xmath58 is a square matrix of dimension @xmath56 , while @xmath59 is a rectangular matrix of dimension @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",

    "consult @xcite .",
    "for this paper we use three different semi - realistic / semi - empirical shell model interactions .",
    "all three interactions started from realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions , from which an effective interaction ( e.g. , a g - matrix ) was derived .",
    "at this point the interaction is expressed numerically as two - body matrix elements @xmath65 .",
    "the interactions were all then further modified in order to fit experimental spectra ; as is well - known to the shell - model community , most of the modification were to the `` monopole '' parts of the interaction , which are related to properties of the mean - field .",
    "all three interactions are similar , but have different starting points and were fitted to different data sets , with the following semi - realistic / semi - empirical interactions : the modified kuo - brown interaction kb3 g @xcite and the brown - richter interaction interaction fpd6 g @xcite and the tokyo interaction gxpf1 @xcite ; the names do not signify much except that pf / fp refer to the @xmath5 shell .",
    "for an alternate approach , we used the quasi - particle proton - neutron random phase approximation ( @xmath66-qrpa ) with a separable interaction of the form    @xmath67    where @xmath68 is the single - particle hamiltonian , @xmath69 is the pairing force , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the particle - hole ( ph ) and particle - particle ( pp ) components , respectively , of the gt force @xmath72 .",
    "we diagonalized our hamiltonian in three consecutive steps as outlined below .",
    "single - particle energies and wave functions were calculated in the nilsson model which takes into account nuclear deformation @xcite . the transformation from the spherical basis to the axial - symmetric deformed basis can be written as @xcite @xmath73    where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are particle creation operators in the deformed and spherical basis , respectively ; the transformation matrices @xmath76 were determined by diagonalization of the nilsson hamiltonian , and @xmath77 represents additional quantum numbers , except @xmath35 , which specify the nilsson eigenstates .",
    "pairing was treated in the bcs approximation , where a constant pairing force with the force strength @xmath78 ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 for protons and neutrons , respectively ) was applied , @xmath81    where the sum over @xmath35 and @xmath82 was restricted to @xmath83 , and @xmath84 represents the orbital angular momentum .",
    "the bcs calculation gave the quasi - particle energies @xmath85 .",
    "a quasi - particle basis was introduced via @xmath86 @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the time - reversed state of @xmath35 , and @xmath89 are the quasi - particle creation ( annihilation ) operators which enter the rpa equation .",
    "the occupation amplitudes @xmath90 and @xmath91 satisfy the condition @xmath92 and were determined by the bcs equations ( see for example @xcite , page 230 ) .    in the pn - qrpa ,",
    "charge - changing transitions are expressed in terms of phonon creation , with the qrpa phonons defined by @xmath93    the sum in eq .",
    "( [ phonon ] ) runs over all proton - neutron pairs with @xmath94 -1 , 0 , 1 , where @xmath95 denotes the third component of the angular momentum .",
    "the ground state of the theory is defined as the vacuum with respect to the qrpa phonons , @xmath96 . the forward- and backward - going amplitudes @xmath97 and @xmath98 are eigenfunctions of the rpa matrix equation    @xmath99   \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } x \\\\ y \\end{array } \\right ] =   \\omega \\left [ \\begin{array}{c }",
    "x \\\\ y \\end{array } \\right ] , \\label{rpa}\\ ] ]    where @xmath100 are energy eigenvalues of the eigenstates and elements of the two submatrices are given by @xmath101 @xmath102    the backward - going amplitude @xmath98 accounts for the ground - state correlations .",
    "it is essential to note however , that the derivation of the qrpa matrix requires ground - state correlations to be only a small correction .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath103 does not imply that ground - state correlations are negligible , since for the calculation of @xmath2 transition matrix elements one always must consider products of the form @xmath104 and @xmath105 . especially in @xmath17 decay , @xmath106 can be larger than @xmath107 ; thus ground - state correlations can not be neglected .",
    "the rpa equation is constructed and solved for each value of the projection @xmath108 , i.e. , @xmath109 -1 , 0 and + 1 .",
    "the equation gives identical eigenvalue spectra for @xmath109 -1 and @xmath109 + 1 , and eigenvalues for @xmath109 0 are always two - fold degenerate , because of the axial symmetry of the nilsson potential .",
    "( hereafter , @xmath108 will be suppressed if not otherwise stated , since the following formulas hold for each @xmath108 ) .    in the pn - qrpa formalism",
    "proton - neutron residual interactions occur in two different forms , namely as particle - hole ( ph ) and particle - particle ( pp ) interaction .",
    "both the particle - hole and particle - particle interaction can be given a separable form .",
    "in the present work , in addition to the well known particle - hole force @xcite @xmath110 with @xmath111 the particle - particle interaction , approximated by the separable force @xcite @xmath112 with @xmath113    was taken into account .",
    "the interaction constants @xmath114 and @xmath115 in units of mev were both taken to be positive .",
    "the different signs of @xmath116 and @xmath117 reflect a well - known feature of the nucleon - nucleon interaction ; namely , that the ph force is repulsive while the pp force is attractive . instead of using a parametrization of chi and kappa values as a function of nucleon number , we chose to fix specific values of chi and kappa for each isotopic chain .",
    "example giving in previous pn - qrpa calculation homma and collaborators took @xmath118 mev and @xmath119 mev @xcite .",
    "these values were deduced from a fit to experimental half - lives and for every isotopic chain fixed values of chi and kappa allowed to deduce a locally best value of chi and kappa ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite which uses the same recipe ) .",
    "for further study of effect of interaction constants , @xmath114 and @xmath115 , on the pn - qrpa calculations , we refer to @xcite .",
    "it was later shown that fixing values of @xmath114 and @xmath115 for an isotopic chain led to better reproduction of experimental data @xcite .",
    "for the case of nickel and iron isotopes the values of interaction constants were taken accordingly from ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , respectively .",
    "the values of @xmath120 and @xmath121 , along with the value of deformation parameter , used in the current work , are shown in table  [ ta1 ] .",
    "using a separable interaction allows the pn - qrpa calculations to be solved in a much larger single - particle basis than with a general / semi - realistic interaction ; in this case we used up to 7 @xmath122 shells .",
    "such calculations have been used extensively in computing gt transitions for astrophysical applications for a wide variety of nuclide ( e.g. @xcite )    matrix elements of the forces which appear in rpa equation  ( [ rpa_a]),([rpa_b ] ) are separable , @xmath123 @xmath124 with @xmath125 which are single - particle gt transition amplitudes defined in the nilsson basis .",
    "for the case of separable forces , the matrix equation  ( [ rpa ] ) reduces to an algebraic equation of second order ( when @xmath115 = 0 ) and with a finite value of @xmath115 it transforms to a fourth order equation .",
    "methods of finding roots of these equations can be seen in ref .",
    "@xcite . for details on qrpa model parameters",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to compare general trends of these calculations with the @xmath126 calculations using a more general , realistic interaction described in the previous section .",
    "using the gamow - teller operator @xmath64 yields the ikeda sum rule @xcite for a parent nucleus with @xmath127 protons and @xmath128 neutrons : @xmath129 in our calculations . for use in astrophysical reaction rates , and to compare to experimental data , and to prior calculations , we multiply our results by a quenching factor of 0.6 @xcite typical for nuclei . note that we do not include the axial weak coupling constant @xmath130 as the published data and calculations we compare to also leave it out , see for example eq .  1 in @xcite , which uses a quenching factor of @xmath131 .",
    "the ultimate goal is to provide reliable weak rates for astrophysical environments , many of which can not be measured experimentally . even theoretically this is a complex and difficult issue .",
    "for example , @xmath2-decay and capture rates are exponentially sensitive to the location of gt@xmath18 resonance while the total gt strength affect the stellar rates in a more or less linear fashion @xcite . in",
    "sufficiently hot astrophysical environments one must include rates with an excited parent state .",
    "but rates off excited states are difficult to get : an @xmath7 experiment on a nucleus @xmath132 shows where in @xmath133 the gt@xmath18 centroid corresponding only to the ground state of @xmath132 resides .",
    "the calculations described in this paper are also limited only to ground state parents , although we hope to tackle excited parents in the future . for a discussion of calculation of excited state gt strength functions we refer to @xcite using the shell model and @xcite using the pn - qrpa model .    for this paper",
    "we focus on the variation in gamow - teller strengths from different rpa calculations , to give us an idea of the theoretical uncertainty .",
    "table  [ ta3 ] shows the mutual comparison of the various rpa models used in this project .",
    "this table shows the values of the centroids , widths and total strength values of the calculated and measured ( where available ) gt distributions , both in @xmath15 and electron capture directions , for various iron - regime nuclei .",
    "it is clear from table  [ ta3 ] that the gxpf1 interaction calculates the biggest value of the total gt strength . on the other",
    "end the pn - qrpa tends to calculate lower total strength values . regarding the calculation of centroids in various rpa models",
    ", we note that the pn - qrpa calculated centroid resides at lower energy in daughter , except for the case of @xmath134fe where the kb3 g interaction calculates the lowest centroids in the electron capture direction . on the other extreme",
    "the gxpf1 calculates the highest centroids except for the case of @xmath134fe where the pn - qrpa model tops the chart in the electron capture direction .",
    "one also notes that the pn - qrpa calculated gt strength distributions tend to have a larger width . for related discussion on the pn - qrpa built on a deformed self - consistent mean field basis obtained from two - body density - dependent skyrme forces for iron mass region",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the calculated gt strength distributions using different interactions will next be discussed below",
    ".    an obvious question would be how the various rpa calculations compare with the measured data as well as full shell - model diagonalization .",
    "thus we also show in table  [ ta3 ] how the values of calculated gt centroids and total gt strengths ( both in @xmath15 and electron capture directions ) , using various rpa models , compare with the available experimental data . for the sake of comparison",
    "we also include the shell model calculation using the gxpf1j hamiltonian @xcite taken from table  i of ref .",
    "@xcite ( the centroid value was not available ) .",
    "the authors claimed that the gxpf1j interaction leads to spreading of calculated strength and better reproduction of observed strength in fe and ni isotopes ( see also ref .",
    "overall , the differences between the shell - model diagonalization strengths and those from rpa calculations using shell - model interactions is similar to that previously reported @xcite .",
    "the experimental centroids and widths were calculated from the reported measured data and all measured data are given to one decimal place in table  [ ta3 ] .",
    "for the @xmath15 side the measured data for @xmath135fe were taken from refs .",
    "it is to be noted that the recent high - resolution ( @xmath20he , @xmath9 ) charge - exchange reaction on @xmath135fe performed by adachi and collaborators @xcite report a much lower value of @xmath136 = 4.00 @xmath137 0.37 up to 12 mev in @xmath135co .",
    "@xcite reported the total strength of @xmath136 = 7.8 @xmath137 1.9 and was not able to calculate b(gt ) values at discrete excitation energies beyond 4.5 mev in daughter .",

    "[ fig5 ] that the pn - qrpa calculated strength is still more fragmented over a range of energies with two distinct peaks at 5.7 mev and 10.6 mev in the daughter nucleus .",
    "the consequences of calculating a much more fragmented strength distribution for @xmath138ni , using the pn - qrpa model , may also have interesting scenario for heavy element nucleosynthesis and requires further attention in nuclear network calculations .",
    "the cumulative strength distributions for the case of @xmath139ni is shown finally in fig .",
    "the upper panel shows the data for the @xmath15 direction of @xmath139ni .",
    "measured data were taken from the charge - exchange ( @xmath20he , t ) reaction performed by fujita and collaborators @xcite with a total strength of @xmath142 = 3.5",
    ". a much higher total strength of @xmath136 = 7.5 @xmath137 1.8 was measured by rapaport and collaborators @xcite .",
    "however their measured data could not be presented in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for reasons already mentioned before .",
    "the upper panel also shows that the fpd6 , gxpf1 and kb3 g models calculate strength up to higher energies in @xmath139cu as compared to the pn - qrpa model .",
    "consequently the pn - qrpa models calculate the gt@xmath14 centroid at a much lower energy of around 5 mev in @xmath139cu which also compares well with the experimental value of 6.9 mev .",
    "the gxpf1 calculated centroid is thrice the value calculated by the pn - qrpa model and can bear strong astrophysical consequences .",
    "the lower panel depicts the data for the electron capture direction of @xmath139ni .",
    "here we also show the measured data by cole and collaborators @xcite who extracted a total strength of @xmath143 = 4.1 @xmath137 0.3 ( it is to be noted that the previous measured data by el - kateb and co - workers also measured a total strength of 4.0 @xcite ) once again the pn - qrpa model calculates the lowest whereas the gxpf1 model calculates the highest values for the gt@xmath18 centroid .",
    "the pn - qrpa calculated placement of centroid ( 3.6 mev ) compares well with the measured centroid of 4.4 mev .",
    "it is the case of @xmath139ni where one sees the largest difference in the placement of centroid using the qrpa and various rpa interactions .",
    "under astrophysical conditions , both the electron capture and beta decay of fp - shell nuclei depend heavily on the centroid placement and total strength of the calculated gamow - teller strength distributions . in this work we presented a comparative study of the gamow - teller strength distributions for a suite of astrophyiscally important fp - shell nuclide ( @xmath22fe , and @xmath23ni ) using a suite of interactions , including semi - realistic interactions in the @xmath0-@xmath1 space with the rpa and a separable multi - shell interaction in the quasi - particle rpa . where possible , we also presented comparison with measured data .",
    "we further compared and contrasted the statistics of calculated and measured gt strength functions using various pn - rpa schemes in this paper .",
    "our calculations satisfied the model independent ikeda sum rule .",
    "work is currently in progress for other important odd - a and odd - odd cases .",
    "the qrpa model places the centroid at much lower energies in daughter nuclei as compared to other rpa interactions .",
    "further the placement of gt centroids by the pn - qrpa model is , in general , in good agreement with the centroids of the measured data .",
    "this tendency of qrpa model can favor higher values of electron capture rates in stellar environment and can bear significance for astrophysical problems . on the other extreme , the gxpf1 interaction usually leads to placement of gt centroid at much higher energies in daughter compared to other pn - rpa interactions .",
    "the present study showed that the total strengths , using various rpa interactions , were in better agreement with the measured data when compared to the qrpa calculated strength .",
    "further the width of the strength functions calculated within the qrpa was much larger than those calculated with other rpa interactions .",
    "for the special @xmath141 nucleus @xmath138ni , the qrpa model calculated gamow - teller strength function was well fragmented as compared to other rpa interactions ( including the recently used gxpf1j interaction ) and may lead to interesting consequences for heavy element nucleosynthesis .    *",
