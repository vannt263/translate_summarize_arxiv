    "graphene , a two - dimensional crystal with hexagonal lattice formed by carbon atoms , has attracted a lot of attention in recent years both as a novel material with many unusual properties @xcite and as a unique laboratory which allows to study numerous quantum - field - theoretical phenomena in desktop - scale experiments ( see @xcite for a review and further references ) .",
    "electronic transport properties of graphene are of particular interest for industrial applications .",
    "theoretical considerations within the tight - binding model of crystal lattice show that in the absence of interactions and at low energies charge carriers in graphene behave as massless dirac fermions with an effective `` speed of light '' being equal to the fermi velocity @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the conductivity of these massless dirac fermions takes a universal value @xmath7 in the limit of zero temperature and in the absence of interactions @xcite .",
    "this value , however , should strongly depend on the measurement procedure and on the geometry of a sample @xcite .    due to the smallness of @xmath8 ,",
    "electromagnetic interactions between these dirac fermions are well described by the instantaneous coulomb potential . however , for the same reason the resulting effective field theory turns out to be strongly coupled with a coupling constant @xmath9 .",
    "thus one can expect that coulomb interactions between electrons can significantly modify the properties of graphene such as the quasiparticle spectrum and the conductivity .",
    "for graphene on a substrate with dielectric permittivity @xmath4 coulomb interaction is screened so that the coupling decreases by a factor @xmath10 .",
    "this provides a practical way to control the interaction strength .",
    "experimental studies of the conductivity of suspended graphene @xcite , for which the coupling constant is maximal , suggest the existence of a gap in the quasiparticle spectrum with the width of order of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "the opening of a gap due to strong coulomb interactions for @xmath12 is also supported by analytical calculations based on the solution of the gap equation @xcite and on the strong - coupling expansion in lattice gauge theory @xcite .",
    "the transition to the gapped phase is likely to be of the second order @xcite . within the effective theory of dirac quasiparticles the opening of a gap in the spectrum is accompanied by a formation of the fermion chiral condensate @xmath13 @xcite . in terms of the original tight - binding lattice model , such condensate corresponds to the difference of the charge carrier densities on the two simple sublattices of the hexagonal lattice @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "more recent measurements @xcite indicate the absence of a gap in the quasiparticle spectrum of suspended graphene as well as logarithmic divergence of the fermi velocity near the fermi points , in agreement with analytical calculations based on renormalization - group techniques @xcite , dynamical mean - field theory @xcite and expansion in the large number of fermion flavors @xcite .    in view of such uncertainties both in the experimental measurements and analytical calculations",
    ", it seems natural to turn to the first - principle numerical methods , such as monte - carlo simulations on the lattice .",
    "this line of research has been actively pursued recently . in @xcite",
    "the low - energy effective field theory of dirac quasiparticles in graphene was studied numerically by using @xmath14-dimensional staggered lattice fermions coupled to @xmath15-dimensional non - compact abelian lattice gauge field .",
    "a hint on the second - order semimetal - insulator phase transition at @xmath16 associated with the opening of a gap in the energy spectrum and spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of dirac fermions was found . in @xcite a similar model with staggered fermions and a contact interaction term instead of",
    "the coulomb potential was studied , and a phase transition with respect to the coupling constant separating the gapless conducting weak - coupling phase and the gapped insulating strong - coupling phase was also observed .",
    "a study of the finite - temperature phase transition in this model was reported in @xcite .",
    "a phase transition of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless type was found at @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the width of the gap in the spectrum .    a common strategy of the works @xcite was to use the value of the fermion condensate as an order parameter .",
    "recently , the results of the direct numerical measurements of the conductivity of graphene lattice effective field theory with staggered fermions were reported in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the dc conductivity obtained from the green - kubo relations indeed rapidly decreases when the fermion condensate is formed , in agreement with theoretical expectations .",
    "the effect of lattice artifacts of staggered fermions on the flavor symmetry breaking in graphene effective field theory was discussed in @xcite , with the conclusion that lattice simulations with staggered fermions might yield somewhat lower value of the critical coupling constant than in the continuum graphene effective field theory .",
    "thus the influence of such lattice artifacts could probably shift the critical coupling constant of the semimetal - insulator phase transition above the value of the coupling constant in suspended graphene .",
    "such a shift would then explain the fact that the insulating state of the suspended monolayer graphene was not observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "lattice regularization of the effective field theory of graphene used in @xcite involves two approximations : one first starts from the tight - binding lattice model of the electron transport in graphene @xcite and derives the low - energy effective theory of dirac fermions .",
    "this theory is then again discretized on the lattice by using suitable lattice fermions which reproduce the dirac spectrum at low energies .",
    "however , since the original model is already formulated on the hexagonal lattice , it is tempting to circumvent these two approximations and perform direct simulations of the tight - binding model with coulomb interactions included .",
    "this possibility has been recently discussed in @xcite .",
    "such simulations , while technically being even simpler than simulations with staggered fermions , have several crucial advantages .",
    "first , they allow to study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking which are specific for the hexagonal lattice , such as the kekule distortion .",
    "despite the fact that sublattice symmetry is not broken in this case , a gap in the spectrum might develop @xcite .",
    "second , since the lattice spacing is fixed in the tight - binding model , simulation results can be unambiguously compared with experimental data . finally , all the symmetries of the tight - binding model are explicitly preserved . as discussed in section [ sec : sublat_symm ] , the latter has a @xmath19 symmetry associated with the conservation of the total numbers of charge carriers with different spins as well as the discrete sublattice symmetry .",
    "sublattice symmetry can be explicitly broken by the staggered potential @xmath20 , which plays the role of the dirac mass at low energies .",
    "in contrast , massive staggered fermions have only single global @xmath21 symmetry associated with total charge conservation @xcite .",
    "thus simulations of the tight - binding model are free from lattice artifacts and can serve as a completely independent cross - check of simulations with staggered fermions .",
    "in particular , one can estimate the influence of lattice artifacts of staggered fermions on the simulation results .",
    "in this paper we report on the results of such direct lattice monte - carlo simulations of the tight - binding model of graphene on hexagonal lattice with coulomb interactions . to account for the latter ,",
    "we couple the tight - binding model to the @xmath15-dimensional non - compact abelian lattice gauge field , as in @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the approach of @xcite , where the interactions are treated by applying the hubbard - stratonovich transformation , the resulting action is local and gauge fields outside of graphene plane can be efficiently sampled by a heat - bath algorithm @xcite . as we demonstrate in subsection [ subsec : em_field_action ]",
    ", our discretization of electric field on the hexagonal lattice reproduces the continuum coulomb potential with a very good precision .",
    "an additional advantage of the use of @xmath15-dimensional gauge fields is the possibility to study electromagnetic interactions of multilayered graphene , for example , casimir forces .",
    "we focus on the study of spontaneous breaking of sublattice symmetry as well as on the direct measurements of electric conductivity of graphene . in agreement with the results of @xcite",
    ", we find that sublattice symmetry is spontaneously broken for coupling constants @xmath12 , which corresponds to the substrate dielectric permittivities @xmath0 , and for sufficiently small temperatures @xmath22 . at higher temperatures sublattice symmetry",
    "is not broken for the physical values of @xmath4 , @xmath23 .",
    "it should be stressed , however , that in this paper we only consider the tight - binding model at finite temperature with the purpose of finding the range of lattice parameters which describe the low - temperature phase of this model .",
    "for this reason we also do not take into account the thermal fluctuations of the hexagonal lattice itself , which should become irrelevant for sufficiently low temperatures . as we will demonstrate below ( see subsection [ subsec : latt_params ] ) , realistic lattice parameters correspond to quite high temperatures of the electron gas of order of @xmath24 .",
    "simulations at significantly lower temperatures are computationally very expensive , and it is important to give an upper bound for the temperatures which still describe the low - temperature phase in order to make an optimal choice of lattice parameters for practical simulations .",
    "as we will show in subsection [ subsec : sublat_symm_num_res ] , the critical temperature which separates the low- and the high - temperature phases of the tight - binding model can be estimated as @xmath25 .",
    "thus one can hope that for the smallest temperature which we use in our simulations , @xmath26 , the low - temperature properties of the tight - binding model are already reproduced with a sufficiently good precision . since at temperatures of order of @xmath27 a real graphene monolayer",
    "would be destroyed due to thermal fluctuations of the lattice @xcite , a detailed study of the finite - temperature phase transition within the tight - binding model ( without taking into account the phononic degrees of freedom ) seems to be of purely academic interest only .",
    "we extract the conductivity from the correlators of electric current densities with the help of the green - kubo relations . in order to estimate the conductivity in a model - independent way",
    ", we consider the low - frequency conductivity @xmath28 smeared over frequencies @xmath29 .",
    "we observe that in the strong - coupling regime the low - frequency conductivity quickly decreases with @xmath4 down to @xmath30 of its weak - coupling value at all temperatures which we have considered . on the other hand , in the weak - coupling regime ( @xmath3 ) the conductivity",
    "practically does not depend on @xmath4 .",
    "the outline of the paper is the following . in section",
    "[ sec : lattice_action ] we give a detailed description the geometry of hexagonal lattice and its extension to the @xmath31-dimensional space , and describe the lattice actions for the gauge field and for fermions which we use in our simulations .",
    "the details of our simulation algorithm and the choice of lattice parameters are also discussed in this section . in section [ sec : sublat_symm ] we discuss spontaneous breaking of sublattice symmetry .",
    "our numerical measurements of the conductivity are summarized in section [ sec : conductivity ] . in section [ sec : conclusions ] we give some concluding remarks on our results . some technical details and supplementary material ( such as the calculation of the current - current correlator for the non - interacting tight - binding model )",
    "are relegated to the appendices .",
    "with a good precision the electronic properties of graphene can be described by the tight - binding hamiltonian @xcite @xmath32 where summation goes over all neighboring sites @xmath33 , @xmath34 on the hexagonal lattice with hexagon side @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the hopping energy for carbon @xmath37 orbitals . @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the creation and annihilation operators for non - relativistic electrons with spin @xmath40 .",
    "this hamiltonian describes electron hopping between nearest neighbor atoms only .",
    "the hopping energy for hopping between next to nearest neighbor atoms is much smaller than @xmath41 @xcite and we neglect it here .",
    "since in the ground state graphene is electrically neutral , there should be on average one electron per lattice site .",
    "we assume that the ground state of the free tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ tb_hamiltonian ] ) is fixed by the conditions @xcite @xmath42 thus there is one electron with spin @xmath43 at each lattice site . for the ground state fixed by ( [ free_ground_state ] ) ,",
    "it is convenient to define the creation and annihilation operators for `` particles '' and `` holes '' as @xcite @xmath44 in the definition of @xmath45 , we take the plus sign for lattice sites which belong to one simple rhombic sublattice of the graphene hexagonal lattice and the minus sign for lattice sites on another simple sublattice @xcite . now the ground state satisfies the standard condition @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the charge operator reads @xmath48 in other words , we interpret the absence of electron at some lattice site as the positively charged hole , and valence electrons in graphene play the role of the dirac sea .",
    "obviously , the tight - binding hamiltonian in terms of the new operators has the same form as ( [ tb_hamiltonian ] ) with an additional shift of energy which does not affect physical results .",
    "it should be stressed that since in the partition function ( and hence also in lattice monte - carlo simulations ) we anyway sum over all possible states of the theory , the particular choice of the `` perturbative '' vacuum state ( [ free_ground_state ] ) is only a matter of convenience .",
    "coulomb interaction is described by the interaction hamiltonian @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the distance between lattice sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 , @xmath51 is the electron charge . throughout the paper",
    "we use the natural system of units with @xmath52 .",
    "a common way to simulate theories with four - fermion interaction of the form ( [ interaction_hamiltonian ] ) is to apply the hubbard - stratonovich transformation and to sample the fictitious hubbard - stratonovich field . for the long - ranged three - dimensional coulomb potential ( [ interaction_hamiltonian ] )",
    "the resulting action is nonlocal @xcite .",
    "here we adopt a different strategy and consider the tight - binding model ( [ tb_hamiltonian ] ) coupled to the real electromagnetic field .",
    "this coupling is introduced by using the standard peierls substitution within the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ tb_hamiltonian ] ) @xcite : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the operator of the integral of the electromagnetic vector potential @xmath55 along the lattice bond which joins the sites @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , we use the operators @xmath56 and the momenta canonically conjugate to them to approximate the hamiltonian of the electromagnetic field in continuous space @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the operator of the electric field strength , and to construct the corresponding lattice action .",
    "it turns out that such a discretization of the electromagnetic field reproduces the continuum coulomb potential with a very good precision ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : coulomb_test ] in subsection [ subsec : em_field_action ] ) . the hamiltonian ( [ em_field_hamiltonian_continuum ] ) should be also supplemented with the gauss law constraint @xmath60     for the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ tb_hamiltonian_peierls ] ) with the staggered potential of strength @xmath20 at different ratios @xmath61 .",
    "the points on the plot and the inset illustrate the filling of the graphene brillouin zone with discrete lattice momenta for @xmath62 lattice with periodic boundary conditions.,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ] +    let us also note that the spectrum of the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ tb_hamiltonian ] ) has two zero - energy states which correspond to the fermi points ( see appendix [ appsec : spectrum ] for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "these zero modes might result in certain singularities of the effective action of electromagnetic field , namely , in the appearance of zero modes of the fermionic hopping operator .",
    "these zero modes make standard numerical simulation methods such as hybrid monte - carlo inapplicable @xcite . in order to prohibit the existence of zero modes , it is convenient to introduce the staggered potential which is equal to @xmath63 for lattice sites which belong to one simple sublattice of the hexagonal lattice and @xmath64 for sites of the other sublattice . as we will see from what follows , for the purpose of numerical simulations",
    "it is convenient to take @xmath65 .",
    "the addition of such potential to the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ tb_hamiltonian ] ) opens a gap of width @xmath66 in its spectrum and prohibits the existence of zero modes ( see appendix [ appsec : spectrum ] ) , however , at the cost of explicit breaking of sublattice symmetry .",
    "as we show in appendix [ appsec : hopping ] , this gap can not be closed due to interactions , thus at nonzero @xmath20 monte - carlo simulations are possible for any value of the coupling constant @xmath67 in ( [ interaction_hamiltonian ] ) . at low energies the coefficient @xmath20 plays the role of the mass of dirac quasiparticles in graphene @xcite . in order to describe the physics of massless fermions",
    ", we should extrapolate simulation results to @xmath68 .",
    "this situation is very similar to lattice qcd simulations , which are only possible at nonzero quark masses and the chiral limit is reached only by extrapolation .",
    "dispersion relation @xmath69 for the tight - binding hamiltonian ( [ tb_hamiltonian ] ) with the staggered potential of strength @xmath20 is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] at different ratios @xmath61 .",
    "the points on the plot and the inset illustrate the filling of the graphene brillouin zone with discrete lattice momenta on the two - dimensional toric lattice made of @xmath62 hexagons ( see subsection [ subsec : lattice_geometry ] and appendix [ appsec : spectrum ] for more details ) .    finally , taking into account all the refinements of the tight - binding model discussed above and using the fermionic operators introduced in ( [ operator_redef ] ) , we arrive at the following hamiltonian : @xmath70 since particles and holes have opposite charges , in the first term in ( [ tb_hamiltonian_peierls ] ) one should take the plus sign before @xmath56 and @xmath71 for @xmath72 and the minus sign for @xmath43 . in the second term , summation over @xmath73 and @xmath74 denotes summation over the sites of two simple sublattices of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "a starting point for lattice monte - carlo simulations is the path integral representation of the partition function and operator expectation values for the tight - binding model interacting with electromagnetic field : @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 is the temperature , the trace is taken over the joint hilbert space of the fermions and the electromagnetic field , @xmath78 are some operators and @xmath79 . as usual , exactly zero temperature can not be reached in lattice monte - carlo simulations , but a reasonably small value can be achieved by using lattices with sufficiently large size in euclidean time direction .",
    "we construct the lattice approximation to the path integral representation of the partition function ( [ partition_function1 ] ) in subsections [ subsec : em_field_action ] and [ subsec : fermionic_action ] below . in subsection",
