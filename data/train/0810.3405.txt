    "wide field blank sky surveys at millimeter and sub - millimeter wavelengths have established a population of active star forming galaxies at high redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these sources or so - called submillimeter galaxies ( smgs ) dominate the ( sub-)millimeter background , and represent ( 50 - 75)% of the star formation at high redshift causing a significant revision to the optically derived star formation history of the universe @xcite .",
    "the bulk of this population lies at redshifts below z=3 , with far - infrared ( fir ) luminosities of @xmath11l@xmath12 , which ( if powered by star - formation ) imply star - formation rates in excess of 1000m@xmath12 yr@xmath13 .",
    "this is sufficient to build up the stellar mass of a giant elliptical galaxy in about 1 gyr @xcite . at redshifts z@xmath143",
    "about 100 smgs are now known , many of which have been studied in detail , including co observations that indicate that they are very massive systems @xcite .",
    "recent high resolution studies of the molecular gas in z@xmath82 - 3 smgs @xcite showed that the star forming regions are fairly compact and that the smgs resemble `` scaled - up and more gas - rich versions '' of the local ultra - luminous infra - red galaxies ( ulirgs ; e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . due to their derived central densities , which are close to those of ellipticals or massive bulges",
    ", they appear to form stars at the maximal rate over very short time scales (  maximum starburst  ) .",
    "thus the smgs phase appears to last for about 100myr @xcite .",
    "these massive starburst galaxies place tight constraints on galaxy formation models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". one major focus of current and future ( sub-)mm surveys is to identify these massive starbursts at z@xmath93 , a redshift range for which smgs could place tight constraints on hierarchical merger vs. monolithic collapse models in galaxy formation scenarios .",
    "the discovery of such an smg above a redshift of z=4 indicates that massive galaxy formation is already well under - way when the universe is only 1.5 gyr old .",
    "the recently discovered object originally selected as a v band drop - out with a weak radio counterpart @xcite and with a stellar mass of @xmath15 , a young starburst age of 2 - 8myr and a star formation rate of sfr @xmath16 is a candidate for such a z@xmath94 smg , as it was detected in its fir continuum @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a standard concordance cosmology ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the bolometer camera mambo-2 at the iram 30 m telescope was used in on - off mode in december 2007 and january 2008 to measure the 1.2 mm flux density of j1000 + 0234 .",
    "the weather conditions during the observations were good , the reduction was performed using mopsic ( written by r. zylka , iram ) .",
    "the achieved rms for a total on - sky integration of 70min is 0.67mjy . j1000",
    "+ 0234  was detected at a 5@xmath4 level with a total 1.2 mm continuum flux density of 3.4mjy .",
    "the @xmath0co(4 - 3 ) line tracing cold molecular gas in j1000 + 0234  was observed with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) between january and april 2008 in the special c and c configurations .",
    "both receivers were tuned to the redshifted line frequency of 83.3257ghz covering a total bandwidth of @xmath8 0.9ghz . for calibration and mapping",
    ", we used the standard iram gildas software packages clic and mapping @xcite .",
    "the quasar 1005 + 058 was used for atmospheric calibration while standard calibrators were used for flux calibration .",
    "the 12hr of total integration time result in a data cube of 2.3@xmath181.9  resolution ( using robust weighting ) with an rms of @xmath19 for 20mhz ( @xmath20 ) wide channels .",
    "we used the vla in d configuration to observe the @xmath0co(2 - 1 ) line in june and july 2008 for a total of 21hr .",
    "the two 50  mhz wide correlator units ( each corresponding to a velocity width of @xmath21 ) were tuned to 41.6352ghz ( on - line ) and 41.7351ghz ( off - line ) .",
    "the observations were done in the fast - switching mode using the nearby quasar 1018 + 055 , at a distance of 5.3@xmath22 from our source , for atmospheric amplitude and phase calibration .",
    "20 antennas were available during the observations and the phase stability was typically @xmath23 .",
    "the final images using natural weighting have a resolution of 1.9@xmath181.4  and an rms of 49@xmath24 .    all observed and derived properties of j1000 + 0234  are summarized in tab . [",
    "tab : prop ] .",
    "the co(4 - 3 ) line was detected at a 5.5@xmath4 level ( fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) in a 280mhz wide channel , which corresponds to a full line width at zero intensity ( fwzi ) of @xmath1 , i.e. with an integrated flux of 0.66jy@xmath25 .",
    "the peak position of the co(4 - 3 ) emission ( see fig . [",
    "fig : comp ] ) agrees very well within the positional uncertainties with the rest - frame near - ir and radio position derived by @xcite .",
    "the line emission of co(4 - 3 ) is centered at an observed frequency of 83.1857ghz , which corresponds to a redshift of z=4.5423 ( assuming a rest frequency of 461.040768ghz for @xmath0co(4 - 3 ) ) .",
    "given the large line width this is in agreement with the optically derived redshift of z=4.547@xmath260.002 @xcite .",
    "the co(4 - 3 ) emission coincides with the rest - frame optical counterpart ( as traced by the irac data ) of j1000 + 0234  ( fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] ) . averaging the remaining channels blue- and redwards of the detected line emission results in a line - free image of 620mhz width ( @xmath27 ) with a tentative 2.2@xmath4 detection of the continuum at the rest - frame optical / radio position of the source ( fig .",
    "[ fig : co ] ) .",
    "the vla observations with a channel width of @xmath21 are centered at the middle of the line detected in co(4 - 3 ) .",
    "co(2 - 1 ) line emission is detected at the 3.3@xmath4 level and coincides spatially with the co(4 - 3 ) emission within its positional uncertainties of fwhm@xmath28/(s / n)@xmath80.5  .",
    "only about a third of the total line width was covered during the vla observations , so the detected line flux of 0.057jy@xmath2 could be higher by a factor of @xmath83 , taking the missed blue- and redshifted emission into account by assuming a box - car line shape .",
    "the ratio of the co(4 - 3 ) line flux of 0.66jy@xmath2 to the thus corrected co(2 - 1 ) line flux of @xmath80.16jy@xmath2 is about 4 , implying that the molecular gas is still thermalized at the j=4 - 3 transition , as the flux still increases with @xmath29 at this transition .",
    "continuum emission from j1000 + 0234  was detected at 1.2 mm at ( 3.4@xmath260.67)mjy , while the off - line channels in the interferometric observations resulted in a 3@xmath4 upper limit of 150@xmath30jy at 41.7ghz ( vla ) and a tentative 2.2@xmath4 detection of ( 0.17@xmath260.08)mjy at 83.3ghz ( pdbi ) .",
    "all these values are consistent with the sed fits presented by @xcite ( p. capak , priv . comm . ) . ] and a dust temperature of 30 - 50 k , typically found in z@xmath82 smgs @xcite .",
    "as the molecular gas appears to be thermalized at least up to the co(4 - 3 ) transition as inferred above , its line flux can be used to estimate the co luminosity [ setting @xmath31 and hence the molecular gas mass present in j1000 + 0234 . to derive the co luminosity @xmath32 and molecular gas mass @xmath33 we use equations 3 and 4 from @xcite with a conversion factor for @xmath34 to @xmath33 of @xmath7=0.8@xmath35 derived for local ulirgs @xcite and used for high redshift objects @xcite .",
    "the observed line flux of @xmath36=0.66jy@xmath2 corresponds to a co luminosity of @xmath37 or a molecular gas mass of @xmath38 .",
    "we imaged the red and blue ( @xmath39 500@xmath2 wide ) halves of the line emission separately , resulting in a 4.7@xmath4 ( red ) and 3.8@xmath4 ( blue ) emission peak , respectively .",
    "the two peaks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velo ] ) show a spatial shift of @xmath8 1  roughly from northwest to southeast ( with a positional uncertainty of @xmath80.5  ) .",
    "this offset corresponds to @xmath8 6.6kpc at the redshift of j1000 + 0234 , suggesting that the co emission might be fairly extended . using this spatial offset between the red- and blue - shifted half of the line emission and the line width of @xmath81000@xmath2",
    ", we can estimate the dynamical mass of j1000 + 0234 .",
    "we use the relation between dynamical mass @xmath40 , velocity width @xmath41 and radial extent @xmath42 of the co emitting region : @xmath43 @xcite . as",
    "the system is likely merging ( as discussed below ) we include also a factor of 2 for a merging system assuming that the gas has already settled into the new potential @xcite . the estimated dynamical mass of j1000 + 0234  is about 1@xmath1810@xmath44 for values of @xmath45 and a radius @xmath42 of 3.3kpc .",
    "thus j1000 + 0234  has a gas fraction of @xmath46 , typical for smgs @xcite .",
    "we would like to caution that the derived offset of @xmath81  has significant uncertainties and thus the derived dynamical mass could be overestimated if the separation were smaller .",
    "the properties of j1000 + 0234  are very similar to the global properties derived for z@xmath82 smgs in terms of molecular gas mass ( @xmath47 ) , extent ( @xmath48 ) , co line width ( @xmath49 ) , dynamical mass ( @xmath50 ) and molecular gas mass fraction ( @xmath8 25% ) @xcite .",
    "its estimated current gas consumption time scale of @xmath51 assuming our gas mass and a sfr of @xmath52 @xcite is similar to the gas depletion rates of @xmath8 100myr found for the z@xmath82 smgs @xcite .",
    "taking together the stellar mass of @xmath53 produced in a recent burst @xmath8 7myr ago @xcite and the available gas reservoir and gas consumption time scale derived here , a significant fraction of the stellar mass of a massive elliptical could be produced on a relatively short time scale .",
    "assuming that these recently formed stars will be passively evolving since then , j1000 + 0234  could turn into a red - and - dead elliptical  like those that are found at z=2 when about 2gyr have passed since z=4.5 .",
    "the molecular gas emission arises from a region that is highly obscured at the observed optical wavelengths ( see fig . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "[ fig : comp ] and [ fig : velo ] ) .",
    "however , it is coincident with the position of the rest - frame optical and radio emission ( fig . [",
    "fig : comp ] ) .",
    "the hst acs image of j1000 + 0234  @xcite was adaptively smoothed @xcite to enhance the structure present in the blue continuum covered by the f814w filter ( fig .",
    "[ fig : velo ] ) .",
    "the molecular gas appears to lie next to bright blue continuum emission that is at its eastern side .",
    "ly@xmath7 emission has also been associated with this bright rim in blue continuum @xcite .",
    "the motion of the gas is roughly along a region of higher extinction ( compared to the blue western component ) running roughly from north to south and shows a larger spatial extent than the blue continuum emission . note the object west of the gas emission is a foreground galaxy at z=1.41 . as already mentioned by @xcite",
    "this geometry is very reminiscent of an ongoing merger .",
    "as the redshift of the molecular gas is very close to the redshift derived from the ly@xmath7 line ( z=4.542 vs. z=4.547 ) , it is very likely that both components belong to the same ( highly disturbed ) system .",
    "both the large fwzi of the co(4 - 3 ) line and the appearance of j1000 + 0234  in ly@xmath7 make an ongoing merger scenario very likely .",
    "we derive a conservative estimate of the merging time for j1000 + 0234  of significantly less than a billion years using the prescription of @xcite for close galaxy pairs with velocities of @xmath54 .",
    "this time scale is consistent with having a relaxed system at a redshift of z=2 .",
    "the expected number of z=4 - 5 smgs from the model of @xcite yields of the order of 10 - 20 such sources within the 2deg@xmath55 cosmos field . as j1000",
    "+ 0234  was originally identified as a lyman break galaxy via its v - band drop @xcite , this suggests that uv emission can be detectable from ongoing major mergers at these redshifts .",
    "we have identified 4 additional v - band dropout lbgs with 4@xmath4 radio detections @xcite that could also be smgs at this redshift .",
    "an inspection of their optical appearance in the hst acs data shows that two of them also have a disturbed geometry .",
    "this suggests that there could be more objects sharing properties of both the smg and lbg population at z@xmath94 and j1000 + 0234  might therefore provide an important link between the smg and lbg populations at high redshifts .    the case of j1000 + 0234  shows that ( at least some ) z@xmath94 smgs can have very similar properties to their well - studied low redshift ( z@xmath82 ) counterparts , that major mergers with very large sfrs are likely present at z=4.5 and that these systems might be the precursors of elliptical galaxies found at the red sequence at a redshift of z=2 .",
