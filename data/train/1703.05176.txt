    "when observed at relatively low frequency , pulsars scintillate , showing an interference pattern in frequency and time that arises from multi - path propagation through the interstellar medium .",
    "the interference patterns often have clear structure , showing a quadratic dependence of the delay of scattering points as a function of their fringe rate ( leading to parabolic arcs in the secondary spectra ) , which is most readily understood if the scattering is dominated by localized points on a strongly anisotropic screen @xcite .",
    "this picture was confirmed dramatically by @xcite , who used very long baseline interferometry to show that the scattering screen of appeared on the sky as a collection of points along a single , linear structure .",
    "the above not only provides surprising information about the nature of the interstellar medium , but also offers a remarkable opportunity to study pulsars : given sufficient understanding of the locations of the scattering points , one can use them as an interferometer , which , with baselines of tens of au , has sub - microarcsecond angular resolution , thus allowing precision astrometry .",
    "indeed , @xcite et al .  used the scintillation for to show that the location of the radio emission shifted by a few 10s of km as a function of spin phase .",
    "the scintillation properties of pulsars are typically inferred from their dynamic spectrum , i.e. , the intensity of a pulsar s folded emission as a function of frequency and time .",
    "this yields direct information on the amplitudes of the interstellar impulse response function , but to retrieve its phase one has to rely on holographic techniques @xcite .",
    "a promising alternative is to use cyclic spectra of pulsars @xcite , which retain part of the phase information .",
    "so far , however , both methods have been shown to work only in specific cases .    in principle",
    ", the interstellar response could be measured directly if an object emitted bursts of emission that lasted much shorter than the scattering time .",
    "some pulsars oblige by emitting suitable short `` giant pulses . ''",
    "one of these is the `` black widow '' pulsar @xcite . in this paper , we show that its giant pulses indeed allow one to measure the interstellar response directly .",
    "we recorded 9.5hr of p - band data of psr b1957 + 20 at the arecibo observatory , as part of a european vlbi network program ( gp  052 ) .",
    "the data were taken in four daily 2.4hr sessions on 2014 june 1316 , recording dual circular polarizations of four contiguous 16mhz wide bands spanning 311.25 to 375.25mhz ( in 2-bit mark  4 format ) .",
    "we exclude the fourth band from our analysis , as its signal was almost fully filtered out by the receiver , as well as the june 15 data , as these cover the eclipse of the pulsar by the wind of its companion @xcite , which hinders our analysis .",
    "we are thus left with 7.2hr of data covering 311.25359.25mhz .",
    "no flux calibrators were observed , so we convert to flux based on a nominal system temperature of 120k and gain of @xmath3 for the 327mhz receiver . with these values",
    ", the folded profile yields an average flux of @xmath4mjy , consistent with the @xmath5mjy found by @xcite .",
    "we searched for giant pulses in the de - dispersed time streams of both polarizations ( using a dispersion measure of @xmath6 , tweaked using the folded profile ) , by binning the power in the whole 48mhz band to @xmath7s resolution and flagging peaks above @xmath8 ( @xmath9jy ) .",
    "we found @xmath10 and @xmath11 pulses in left and right circular polarization , respectively , with @xmath12 of these in common .        in figure",
    "[ fig : phases ] , we show where the giant pulses arrive relative to the average profile .",
    "one sees three clusters , with the first , containing most pulses , coincident with the main pulse , the second coincident with the peak of the interpulse , and the third on the ( relatively weak ) tail of the interpulse .",
    "this distribution is different from what is seen in , where the giant pulses are predominantly found at the trailing edges of the pulse components @xcite .",

    "bottom : _ a segment of the power as a function of frequency for the brightest giant pulse compared with that for the regular emission ( determined using 30s around the pulse , and scaled to match its flux ) .",
    "the bins are 8khz wide , the highest resolution possible given the width of the main pulse in the folded profile.,title=\"fig : \" ] + s bins , with an exponential fit with a timescale of @xmath0s overlaid on its tail .",
    "_ bottom : _ a segment of the power as a function of frequency for the brightest giant pulse compared with that for the regular emission ( determined using 30s around the pulse , and scaled to match its flux ) .",
    "the bins are 8khz wide , the highest resolution possible given the width of the main pulse in the folded profile.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the profiles of the giant pulses show a sharp rise and a long tail , suggesting that the pulses are intrinsically short .",
    "the tails are well fit by an exponential , with a timescale of @xmath0s ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : brightest ] lower panel ) .",
    "the pulses are close to @xmath13 polarized , as expected for intrinsically short , single mode emission .",
    "the giant pulses show no preferred polarization direction , and can be strongly linearly or circularly polarized in either direction , in contrast to the folded profile , which is close to unpolarized @xcite .",
    "this allows us to measure a rotation measure for the source ; fitting a rotation measure to stokes q of the brightest pulse gives @xmath14 .",
    "if giant pulses and the regular pulsar emission are both affected in the same way by propagation through the interstellar medium , an immediate expectation is that their frequency power spectra should show similar structure , and that this structure should vary on the same timescale . comparing the power spectra for the brightest giant pulse with that of the regular emission near it",
    ", we indeed find that the spectra are very similar ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : brightest ] ) .",
    "a stronger expectation is that the impulse response is the same , i.e. , for giant pulses that happen close in time , not just the amplitudes of their spectra should match , but also their phases .",
    "we first verify this is the case for our closest pair , and then show it is possible to use a giant pulse as a direct measurement of the response function .",
    "ns , either because of small differences in the interstellar response , or , more likely , because of intrinsic differences in the two pulses . in either case",
    ", this spread sets an upper bound on the intrinsic duration of both pulses . ]",
    "we directly compare the voltage timestreams of the two closest giant pulses , which are separated by 1.922s .",
    "both are strongly right - hand polarized , with integrated signal - to - noise of 46 and 18 , respectively .",
    "we compute visibilities between the two pulses as a function of time lag in each of the three 16mhz , right - hand circular bands . in figure",
    "[ fig : vis ] , we show the visibility divided by the geometric mean of the auto - correlations , i.e. , a measure of the correlation strength of the voltage streams .",
    "we find strong correlation within a narrow envelope , which proves that the response of the interstellar medium is indeed close to identical for these two pulses , and that their intrinsic durations are very short , @xmath1ns .",
    "the observed data are the convolution of the intrinsic electric field @xmath15 with the impulse response function @xmath16 of the interstellar medium , i.e. , @xmath17 . to the extent that giant pulses approximate impulsive intrinsic emission",
    ", it is thus possible to use them to measure the response , with which it should then be possible to undo the effects of scattering and scintillation , at least within the decorrelation time @xmath18 on which the response changes .    to verify this",
    ", we attempt to measure how well we can `` descatter '' pairs of giant pulses with each other .",
    "we do our analysis in fourier space , where the pulses can be described as @xmath19 if the intrinsic emission is a delta function at @xmath20 , one would have a fourier spectrum with constant amplitude and zero phase , but because of the interstellar response , the signal gets mixed between frequency channels , causing amplitudes to change and phases to rotate ( but with total power conserved ) .    in principle",
    ", the above suggests we could descatter a giant pulse by dividing by a suitably normalised reference pulse . in practice , this is rather noisy , as low - amplitude and thus noisy channels get upweighted and high - amplitude and thus well - measured ones downweighted . instead , therefore , we first normalise the reference pulse at all frequencies , i.e. , @xmath21 . dividing the trial pulse by this",
    "gives , @xmath22 where we dropped the dependence on @xmath23 for brevity .",
    "if the pulses have the same response function and the reference pulse is truly impulsive , this reduces to @xmath24 , i.e. , one would recover the intrinsic spectrum of the trial pulse multiplied by the amplitudes of the response function .",
    "since the phases are corrected but the amplitudes are not , for an intrinsically short pulse , an inverse fourier transform should yield a timestream with a pulse which is similarly short but which has reduced amplitude ( as discussed quantitatively below ) . more generally ,",
    "since we do not have perfect arrival times , there will be an uncertainty in the time offset ( equivalent to a phase gradient in the spectrum ) , and , since the intrinsic pulses are not true delta functions , the power will only be concentrated within the intrinsic width of the emission .",
    "we apply our method first using our brightest giant pulse as a reference , and its five closest neighbours as trial pulses .",
    "our brightest pulse is strongest in right - circular polarization , with an integrated signal - to - noise of 132 . we make fourier transforms for @xmath25s segments for all pulses , covering the majority of the scattering tail (",
    "this corresponds to 1024 real - valued samples and thus 512 channels in each of the three 16mhz bands ) .",
    "we then descatter and inverse transform as above , and bin and sum the power of the descattered timestreams in 250ns bins to account for possible intrinsic widths ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : vis ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : descatter ] .",
    "for the closest pair , one sees that much of the power of the descattered pulse is contained within a single 250ns bin , and that the peak intensity of the descattered pulse is more than 10 times stronger than that of the observed , scatter - broadened one . for the next closest pulse",
    ", the procedure does not seem to work well , with the descattered pulse having multiple peaks .",
    "this is likely intrinsic , since for the further pulses , the descattering does work , though with decreasing efficiency , presumably because the response function becomes increasingly different .",
    "+   +   +   +   +      the above suggests it should be possible to use the extent to which giant pulses can descatter each other to determine the timescale on which the response function changes . for this purpose",
    ", we increase our sample , by selecting as reference pulses all those for which phases can be measured in the fourier spectrum , i.e. , with @xmath26 per voltage sample , corresponding to an integrated signal - to - noise of  @xmath27 in the power .",
    "this results in 6 and 3 pulses in the right and left circular time streams , respectively ( with 1 in common ) . for each of these , we descatter all pulses within 5 minutes to either side , matching the polarizations .",
    "we then sum the power of the descattered timestreams in @xmath28s bins ( which should account for any reasonable intrinsic widths ) , and measure the fraction of the total power which is descattered into a single peak to quantify how well the pulses descattered each other .    with our brightest pulse",
    ", we find that we can recover up to @xmath29 of the total flux in the descattered peak .",
    "for the other , fainter pulses , however , at most half of the power is descattered , as their more limited strength allows only an imperfect measure of the response function . to quantify the imperfection , we simulate giant pulses , using delta functions at a range of strengths convolved with a response simulated by drawing from a normal distribution with zero mean and variance varying as an exponential with the observed @xmath0s decay time ( and normalized to have unity integrated power ) .",
    "we then create pairs with the same response function but different amplitudes and independent noise , and run these through our analysis routines .",
    "as expected , the strength of the reference pulse determines the average power recovered , while the strength of the ( fainter ) trial pulse dominates the scatter between different realisations .",
    "for our set of reference pulses , we find the simulated recovered fraction ranges from 0.4 to  0.7 . from eq .",
    "[ eq : descatter ] , one sees that in the high signal - to - noise limit one should be dominated by the extent to which @xmath30 is less than one .",
    "since our simulations assume @xmath31 is distributed as a @xmath32 distribution with 2 degrees of freedom , one expects @xmath33 , consistent with our results . for lower signal - to - noise",
    ", we find that we can also reproduce our simulated fractions by integrating numerically over probability distributions for both @xmath34 and the noise ( unfortunately , we could not find a closed - form expression ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : timescale ] , we show the fraction of the power that is descattered against time separation for each pulse pair , corrected for the above loss of power ( and with error bars reflecting the expected @xmath35 scatter ) .",
    "one sees that at large separation , @xmath36s , the descattering never recovers much power , while at shorter separation it does , though unequally so .",
    "inspection of the low points around @xmath37s shows that in those cases the descattering does not lead to a single strong pulse ( as for the @xmath38s pulse in fig .",
    "[ fig : descatter ] ) .",
    "likely , this reflects intrinsic pulse structure , with it appearing likely from inspection that some of the reference pulses contain intrinsic structure .",
    "[ section : dynspec ]    we can compare our decorrelation timescale with that derived using the more traditional way , from the autocorrelation of the dynamic spectrum , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we apply this to a dynamic spectrum created for the 9 minutes of data surrounding our brightest giant pulse .",
    "we use bins of 4s , 8khz , and 1/32 in phase ( where the frequency and phase resolution are set to barely resolve the main pulse ; at 8khz , we also barely resolve the frequency structure due to scintillation ) .",
    "we define two off gates , with one subtracted from the folded profile to give a pulsed flux , and the other used as an independent measure of the noise in the dynamic spectrum .",
    "we then compute the auto - correlation of the dynamic spectrum , subtracting the auto - correlation of the noise , and averaging over the central 14mhz of each band ( to avoid the parts most affected by bandpass variations ) .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig : timescale ] .",
    "one sees that at short times the correlation is very good ( it approaches 0.98 rather than 1 , likely because we ignore the frequency dependence of the noise ) , and then it decreases smoothly .",
    "taking the decorrelation time as the lag where the correlation drops by @xmath42 , we find @xmath43s .    in section  [ section : scattering ] , we already showed that the spectrum of brightest pulse was similar to that of the regular emission . with the dynamic spectrum",
    ", we can verify this quantitatively , and also check the dependence on lag .",
    "for this purpose , we fourier transform our brightest giant pulse to the same channelization as the dynamic spectrum ( where 8khz corresponds to @xmath44s in time , i.e. , it covers the full width of the scattering tail ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : brightest ] ) .",
    "we then correlate it against the dynamic spectrum for a range of delays .    at low delay , we find that the giant pulse correlates very strongly with the dynamic spectrum , at @xmath45 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : timescale ] ) .",
    "this strong correlation independently suggests a short intrinsic duration of the giant pulse , as intrinsic structure on timescales comparable to the scattering time will lead to differences in the spectra ( as seen for the scintillation pattern of the crab s giant pulses , @xcite ) . at longer delays , the correlation drops , and we find @xmath43s , the same value obtained from the auto - correlation of the dynamic spectrum .    comparing with the points from descattering giant pulses with each other",
    ", one finds the curves derived using the power spectra form a rough upper envelope , suggesting the decorrelation time is the same .",
    "this is not a trivial comparison , since the auto - correlations take into account the amplitudes of the impulse response function only , while our descattering only uses the phase information .    ) .",
    "the second is a cross - correlation of the spectrum of the brightest giant pulse with the dynamic spectrum ( dashed red curve ; uncertainty estimated from scatter at large @xmath46 ) .",
    "the third uses the fraction of the power of a giant pulse that is descattered by using a bright neighbouring giant pulse as a reference measurements of the impulse response ( blue points with error bars , with size scaled to reflect the strength of the reference pulse ) . here",
    ", the power has been corrected for the expected loss given the signal - to - noise ratio of the reference pulse ( see sect .  [ section : descatter ] ) , and the error bars reflect the uncertainty due to noise in the pulse being descattered .",
    "points less than @xmath47 above the noise inferred from non - pulse parts of the descattered timestream are shown as upper limits .",
    "the square point corresponds to the multi - peaked giant pulse shown in figure 4 . ]",
    "we have shown that giant pulses in can be used as a direct probe of the impulse response function of the interstellar medium : they allow one to descatter other giant pulses .",
    "an immediate result is that we can constrain the typical intrinsic duration of giant pulses of to be very short , @xmath1ns .",
    "having a direct measure of the response also should allow one to verify ( and inform ) the response inferred from the dynamic spectrum ( using holographic techniques ; @xcite ) or from cyclic spectra @xcite , thus putting those techniques on firmer footing .",
    "longer term , one might hope to use all giant pulses  perhaps aided by the dynamic and cyclic spectra  to measure the evolution of the response as a function of time and frequency .",
    "if the scattering towards psr  b1957 + 20 is dominated by a single , highly anisotropic screen , as was found for @xcite , then this should allow one to determine amplitudes and phases of individual scattering points directly .",
    "those , in turn , might allow one to resolve the pulsar s orbit on the sky , as has been done for the pulse emission with spin phase for @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , only few other pulsars show giant pulses . among those , we are most excited to apply our technique to the , since for that source we expect that the main scattering screen , which is in the crab nebula , will resolve the light cylinder , thus opening up the possibility to determine empirically where the giant pulses originate .",
