    "ultrananocrystalline diamond ( uncd ) films have many potential applications in high - temperature electronics because of the highest n - type conductivity and carrier concentration demonstrated for phase - pure diamond thin films .",
    "@xcite experimentally , n - type conductivity of uncd can be tuned within several orders of magnitude by nitrogen addition to the feed gas during plasma - assisted growth . without the nitrogen addition to the plasma",
    ", the resulting films are quite resistive , but addition of more than about 8% of nitrogen leads to a metallic behavior .",
    "interestingly , the grain size increases from 4 nm to 16 nm , as well as the grain boundary width from about 0.5 nm to 2.2 nm with n concentration increase from 0% to 20% , but the overall fraction of diamond phase remains consistently very high .",
    "@xcite at the same time , nitrogen concentration in the films remains nearly the same , suggesting that change in the carrier concentration due to higher number of nitrogen donors can not be invoked to explain the increase of conductivity .",
    "it was shown by careful hall measurements  @xcite that the conductivity is n - type , and that carrier concentrations in the films increase much more than carrier mobilities with increase in feed gas nitrogen concentration .",
    "therefore , these studies suggested that there is a metal - insulator transition in uncd upon nitrogen addition , and that this transition is triggered by changes in uncd grain and grain boundary sizes .",
    "theoretical tight - binding studies  @xcite of uncd without nitrogen suggested a hopping transport mechanism , where the donor sites are located in the grain boundaries and the bulk of the grains is electrically inactive . here",
    "high - angle high - energy grain boundaries were considered to be a model of general grain boundaries of uncd .",
    "the donor states were calculated to be carbon @xmath0-states and dangling bond states in the grain boundaries .",
    "the hopping conductivity of uncd was estimated to be @xmath1 , 3 to 7 orders of magnitude higher than in cvd diamond .",
    "grain boundary and without ( left ) or with ( right ) nitrogen ( relative to the fermi level of undoped system ) .",
    "occupied states are shaded .",
    "sketch of electron levels in the presence of nitrogen is shown on the right .",
    "the data are taken from ref .  .",
    "]    self - consistent charge density functional based tight - binding studies  @xcite of nitrogen sites in the bulk and in the grain boundaries found energies , geometries and electronic structure of nitrogen in uncd at low and high nitrogen concentrations .",
    "first , it was found that nitrogen is energetically preferred in the grain boundary relative to the bulk diamond sites in the grains .",
    "second , nitrogen was found not to be a shallow donor , being preferentially in non - doping configurations .",
    "third , electrons from high - lying donor states formed upon nitrogen addition transfer down in energy to the fermi level , located in the @xmath0-state region .",
    "this causes an upward shift of the fermi level with increase in nitrogen concentration .",
    "calculated dos for diamond grain boundaries with and without nitrogen are shown in fig .",
    "[ figdos ] along with a scheme of electron levels in the latter case .",
    "in addition , the connectivity of the @xmath0-bonds in the grain boundaries improves upon nitrogen addition . this fermi level shift and improved connectivity were proposed to be responsible for increase in hopping conductivity .     and @xmath2 being the characteristic grain size and distance between the grains respectively . ]",
    "however , there is still no satisfactory mesoscopic description of uncd transport properties .",
    "no explanation was provided previously for the transition from hopping to semimetallic regime with increase in n concentration . in this paper",
    "we consider theoretically transport properties of uncd films in the temperature range @xmath3 and investigate uncd conductivity within approximations developed for an array of metallic and semiconducting grains  @xcite in both ohmic and non - ohmic regimes .",
    "for low concentrations of nitrogen ( @xmath4 in the feed gas ) , the resistance of uncd films per square is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the quantum resistance . in this case ,",
    "uncd films are insulators .",
    "the characteristic grain sizes , see fig .  [ fig.grains ] , of uncd films are in the range @xmath7 and characteristic width of the grain boundaries is @xmath8 the charging energies @xmath9 , with @xmath10 being the dielectric constant , corresponding to these grain boundary widths are @xmath11 assuming that the dielectric constant for uncd films is @xmath12 from eq .",
    "( [ charging ] ) follows that the temperature @xmath13 satisfies the inequality @xmath14 in this temperature range the activation conductivity , @xmath15 ( tunneling between the nearest neighbors ) , is suppressed and electron transport occurs through tunneling via several grains .",
    "below we assume that the concentration of donors in the grain boundaries , @xmath16 , satisfies the condition @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the localization length . using the fact that @xmath19 we obtain the following condition for concentration of donors @xmath20 we first consider phonon assisted ( ohmic ) transport in uncd films and later discuss the non - ohmic regime .      following the mott - efros - shklovskii theory  @xcite we write the hopping conductivity in the following form @xmath21 where @xmath18 is the localization length ( @xmath18 is of the order of a boundary width , @xmath2 ) .",
    "equation  ( [ f2 ] ) is valid for @xmath22 samples and thick films with the sample thickness @xmath23 larger than the optimal hopping length @xmath24 defined below .",
    "this is a typical case for uncd films , which are grown to thicknesses of @xmath25 ,  @xcite . minimizing eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) with respect to the hopping distance , @xmath26 , we obtain the optimal hopping length @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the characteristic energy scale . from eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) follows that the hopping length @xmath29 increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "using the fact that the hopping length @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of grains in one hop , we obtain @xmath32 for temperatures @xmath33 and @xmath34 one obtains @xmath35 with increase in temperature the number of grains @xmath36 in one hop will decrease , leading to the hopping distance @xmath29 of the order of the grain size .",
    "also , increase in nitrogen concentration is shown to lead to increase in the grain size .",
    "with increase in the grain size @xmath37 ( and proportional increase in the grain boundary width @xmath2 ) @xmath36 will decrease as @xmath38 .",
    "substituting eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) we finally obtain efros - shklovskii type  @xcite of conductivity behavior @xmath39 equation  ( [ result1 ] ) is valid for temperatures @xmath40 . at temperatures @xmath41",
    "the hopping distance @xmath29 becomes of the order of a grain size and eq .",
    "( [ f2 ] ) does not work anymore .",
    "in this temperature range the conductivity obeys the arrhenius law  ( [ activation ] ) .",
    "we would like to discuss the possibility of the observation of the mott law in uncd films . in semiconductors ,",
    "the efros - shklovskii law may turn to the mott behavior with the increase of temperature .",
    "this happens when the typical electron energy @xmath42 involved in a hopping process becomes larger than the width of the coulomb gap @xmath43 , i.e. when it falls into the flat region of the density of states where mott behavior is expected . to estimate",
    "the width of the coulomb gap @xmath43 - one compares the es expression for the density of states @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the dimensionality of a sample , with the bare density of states @xmath46 , i.e. the dos in the absences of the long - range part of the coulomb interactions . using the condition",
    "@xmath47 we obtain @xmath48 inserting the value for the bare dos , @xmath49 , into eq .",
    "( [ crossover ] ) we finally obtain @xmath50 equation  ( [ delta ] ) means that there is no flat region in the density of ground states and , thus , the mott regime is difficult to observe in uncd films . at first glance , this conclusion contradicts numerically obtained results using tight - binding methods  @xcite since non - zero densities of states at the fermi level was obtained as a result of these calculations .",
    "however , there are relatively few states in the numerical studies because of the number of atom limitations on the size of the unit cells , which leads to uncertainties in the peak positions larger than typical values of coulomb gap of several 10k . in addition",
    ", coulomb gap existence is based on excitonic effects , which are not explicitly taken into account in the tight - binding simulations .",
    "in other words , tight - binding simulations are not designed to accurately reproduce the functional form of dos in the immediate vicinity ( within several tens of kelvins ) of the fermi level .",
    "here we consider non - ohmic conductivity in the temperature range in which the ohmic conductivity is given by eq .",
    "( [ result1 ] ) . in the presence of electric field ,",
    "@xmath51 , the hopping conductivity is given by the following expression @xmath52.\\ ] ]      in a weak electric field , @xmath53 , the last term in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ eer ] ) is not important and the optimal hopping length is given by eq .",
    "( [ r1 ] ) . using eqs .",
    "( [ eer ] ) and ( [ r1 ] ) one obtains for the hopping conductivity in a weak electric field the following expression @xmath54.\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ weak ] ) follows that the coulomb term becomes of the order of the electric field term at fields @xmath55      for electric fields",

    "( [ e * ] ) , the first term in the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ eer ] ) is not important .",
    "the optimal hopping length in this regime is temperature independent and is given by the following expression @xmath58 where @xmath59 ( we note that @xmath60 ) . using eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) one obtains for the hopping conductivity in a strong electric field  @xcite @xmath61 we note that : i ) for very strong electric fields , @xmath62 , where the field @xmath63 is defined below eq .",
    "( [ e ] ) , the hopping picture does not work anymore since the hopping length becomes of the order of the localization length , @xmath64 ; ii ) the current density @xmath65 can be expressed in term of conductivity as follows @xmath66 , where the conductivity @xmath67 is given by eqs .",
    "( [ weak ] ) or ( [ strong ] ) depending on the strength of the electric field @xmath51 .",
    "the transition from the hopping regime to degenerate semiconductor regime in uncd is associated with a strong increase in the number of carriers , whereas the mobility of carriers is not strongly affected .",
    "this was demonstrated in hall measurements  @xcite .",
    "also , higher nitrogen concentration is related to increase in grain size and grain boundary width .",
    "for relatively large concentrations of nitrogen in the plasma , ( @xmath68 ) , the uncd film resistance becomes less than the quantum resistance , @xmath69 . as a result ,",
    "the electron states become delocalized and the transport properties of uncd films can be described using the boltzmann equation .",
    "there are several scattering mechanisms which contribute to the resistance , @xmath70 , of a sample  @xcite : 1 ) scattering of electrons on static impurities , @xmath71 , 2 ) electron - phonon scattering , @xmath72 , and 3 ) electron - electron scattering , @xmath73 . at high temperatures",
    "the interference between different mechanisms can be neglected and the total resistance consists of a sum of resistances @xmath74 where @xmath75 . here",
    "@xmath76 with @xmath77 being the effective mass of an electron and @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the characteristic scattering times due to scattering of electrons on static impurities , phonons and electrons respectively .",
    "we would like to comment on the validity of eq .",
    "( [ resistivity ] ) .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ resistivity ] ) we assume that different scattering mechanisms are independent .",
    "this is indeed the case at not very low temperatures when the scattering lengths @xmath81 , with @xmath82 being the phonon speed and @xmath83 are smaller than the elastic mean free path , @xmath84 . using the condition @xmath85 one can find the characteristic temperature @xmath86 .",
    "for temperatures @xmath87 the interference among different mechanisms is not important and eq .",
    "( [ resistivity ] ) is valid .",
    "below we discuss different contributions to the resistance of uncd films .    assuming that the mean free path of an electron is of the order of the grain boundary width @xmath2 for elastic scattering time one obtains @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is the fermi velocity .",
    "the electron - phonon scattering time @xmath79 is given by the following expression  @xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the debye temperature ( for uncd films @xmath92 ) .",
    "for the temperature range considered here , only the @xmath93 regime is relevant . for electron - electron scattering time @xmath80 one finds @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the chemical potential . using eqs .",

    "( [ rtotal ] ) are small therefore the resistance @xmath70 is almost temperature independent .",
    "in this section we discuss crossover from insulating ( hopping ) to semimetallic regime in uncd films . to find a critical concentration of carriers @xmath97",
    "at which the crossover from insulating to semimetallic regime occurs following the mott s",
    "approach  @xcite , we compare two characteristic lengths : the screening length @xmath98 and the localization length @xmath18 . in the metallic regime",
    "the screening length @xmath99 is small and the localization length @xmath18 is large while in the insulating regime the situation is the opposite .",
    "the crossover region between the two regimes can be defined as @xmath100 . using the above condition we obtain the following expression for",

    "in this section we compare our results for resistivity of uncd films with available experimental data from refs .   and .",
