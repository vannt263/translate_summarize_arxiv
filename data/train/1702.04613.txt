    "<S> , the coated sphere has represented the ideal framework for the investigation of emerging physical phenomena at the nanoscale . in particular , it has been used to exemplify many properties of metal nanostructures , including the frequency tunability of the plasmon resonance @xcite , the plasmon hybridization @xcite , and fano - like resonant lineshapes @xcite . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , coated spheres have inspired new devices such as scattering cancellation cloaks @xcite , spaser - based nanolaser @xcite , and have been also used for the plasmon - enhanced molecular fluorescence @xcite , and for the imaging and therapy of cancer @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> aden and kerker @xcite first obtained the analytical solution of the problem of electromagnetic scattering from a homogeneous sphere coated with a homogeneous layer of uniform thickness . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , li kai and massoli @xcite proposed an extension to multi - layers spherical particles . over the years </S>",
    "<S> , several algorithms have been also developed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the numerical solution @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the mie theory and its extensions such as the one proposed by aden and kerker are not based on spectral theories </S>",
    "<S> . specifically , vector spherical wave functions are not eigenmodes of any formulation of the maxwell s equations in the presence of a coated sphere . </S>",
    "<S> a spectral theory can be of great use in the analysis of resonances and of anomalous scattering phenomena , such as fano lineshapes @xcite , because it allows one to rigorously identify the principal modes contributing to overall scattered field .    moreover , in the mie - aden - kerker solution , the contributions of the material parameters and of the geometry are mathematically intertwined and can not be separated . specifically , the expansion coefficients of the scattered field in terms of vswfs are complicated functions of both the radius and the electric permittivity of the coating . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the design of the cloak to achieve assigned constraints on the scattered electromagnetic field is usually cumbersome . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , although the design of the permittivity of the coating can be carried out analytically in the quasi - electrostatic limit @xcite , and semi - analytically for particles of dimensions less than the incoming wavelength by using perturbation theory @xcite , researchers have to resort to numerical optimization in the general case .    in this manuscript </S>",
    "<S> , we derive an alternative formulation of the scattering problem from a homogeneous sphere with permittivity @xmath0 coated with a homogeneous layer of uniform thickness and permittivity @xmath1 , based on an auxiliary eigenvalue problem . the main feature of the proposed method is that the scattered electric field is represented through a series expansion , where the @xmath2-th addend has the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of an auxiliary eigenvalue problem defined in the following , which do not depend on the permittivity of the coating . </S>",

    "<S> this work represents the extension to the case of a coated sphere of the approach proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where it has been explicitly applied only to the case of a homogeneous sphere . </S>",
    "<S> our approach naturally leads to the one developed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a coated object in the quasi - electrostatic limit . </S>",
    "<S> analogous formulations have been introduced in the past @xcite and applied to the quasi - static limit @xcite , to the scalar mie scattering @xcite , and to describe the full - wave electromagnetic response of a flat - slab composite structure @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> , we also derive the main properties of its eigenvalues and eigenmodes , and we show how the scattered field can be represented in terms of eigenmodes which are independent of the material of the coating . </S>",
    "<S> then , we devote sec . [ sec : formulationsphere ] to particularize these results to the case of a coated sphere , providing the expression of the characteristic polynomial and of the eigenmodes . </S>",

    "<S> [ sec : analysis ] we show how the introduced approach represents the natural framework for the analysis of plasmonic and photonic resonances in core - shell nanoparticle </S>",
