    "a rich low - frequency wave phenomenology showing alfvnic characteristics has been observed in plasmas generated on the h-1 heliac.@xcite previous ideal mhd studies of these waves in cylindrical geometry has shown that cylindrical shear alfvn continuum turning points reproduce important features of measured magnetic frequencies@xcite , and cylindrical global alfvn eigenmode ( gae ) modelling produces plausible radial eigenmode profiles and magnetic attenuation predictions@xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that alfvn waves existing independently in a cylindrical plasma will couple in a toroid due to magnetic field strength modulations , and the same is true for coupling between acoustic waves and alfvn waves at low - frequencies.@xcite since these coupling effects are expected to feature prominently in low aspect - ratio , strongly - shaped plasmas like those created on h-1 , this paper aims to provide a geometrically accurate treatment of h-1 wave physics within the theoretical framework of ideal mhd .",
    "two significant drivers of alfvn wave activity studies in the magnetic confinement fusion context are the direct effects such wave activity may have on plasma confinement , through energetic particle interactions for example , and the diagnostic utility wave activity provides as proxy for determining underlying plasma parameters.@xcite in particular , low - frequency alfvn - acoustic waves have drawn increased attention in recent years as they are generally poorly understood.@xcite even under the simplifying assumptions of ideal mhd , the low - frequency domain is difficult to treat theoretically because , in the presence of geodesic curvature , coupling between alfvn and sound branches introduces considerable complexity to the linearised eigenfrequency spectrum .",
    "furthermore , ideal mhd provides a poor description of compressible motions@xcite , and it omits thermal ion interactions , such as ion landau damping , which become significant in this range of frequencies.@xcite however , ideal mhd has the important advantage that it is simple enough to allow for an accurate treatment of the geometry , providing a good first model for understanding the low - frequency domain.@xcite    in this work we present the three - dimensional , compressible ideal spectrum for h-1 , based on numerical simulations with the three - dimensional continuous spectrum code conti@xcite in combination with the three - dimensional ideal mhd linear eigenmode solver cas3d.@xcite significant coupling of eigenmode fourier harmonics in both toroidal and poloidal directions are induced by a substantial mirror term ( inherent in a helical axis , low aspect - ratio configuration ) in combination with a variety of strong field - strength modulations within a cross - section .",
    "we have found that the conditions for convergence of cas3d in fourier space are quite stringent for h-1 configurations , in the sense that shear alfvn frequencies dip sharply near the core unless the component of fluid motion along the field lines has a fourier basis including at least two toroidal side - bands , even for high - frequency modes with negligible acoustic interaction .",
    "an explanation for this finding is given .",
    "the first two helical alfvn eigenmode ( hae ) gaps and the toroidal alfvn eigenmode ( tae ) gap are identified .",
    "significant beta - induced gap structure is found , starting at around @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , h-1 fluctuations , which typically lie near or below @xmath2 , may be considered sub - gam modes.@xcite based on analytic estimates , it is proposed that h-1 fluctuations may include beta - induced alfvnic eigenmodes partially reproducing characteristic  whale - tail \" structures in configuration space due to hollow temperature profiles .",
    "low frequency discrete modes are presented .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 provides an overview low - frequency h-1 wave activity .",
    "section 3 discusses h-1 equilibrium and magnetic geometry .",
    "section 4 gives a summary of low - frequency stellarator alfvn wave physics as well as a discussion of cas3d convergence requirements for h-1 .",
    "section 5 presents the ideal spectrum and low - frequency discrete modes . in section 6",
    "we show that , in the presence of hollow temperature profiles , the highest beta - induced alfvn eigenmode ( bae ) gap frequency reproduces parts of the configuration - space whale - tails .",
    "we conclude in section 7 .",
    "in this section we discuss low - frequency wave activity on h-1 and give a brief overview of previous studies .",

    "the configurational dependence of fluctuation frequencies is our main focus as h-1 discharges are usually dominated by a single coherent steady - frequency fluctuation present in a time interval with limited variation in equilibrium magnetic field strength and plasma density.@xcite figure [ fig : freqvskappa_davethesis ] shows the frequencies measured by poloidal mirnov coils at different times within discharges for a selection of discharges.@xcite    : magnetic field fluctuation frequencies measured by poloidal mirnov array coils against @xmath7 . ]",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the  v \" structures ( which we term  whale - tails \" ) near @xmath9 and @xmath10 in figure [ fig : freqvskappa_davethesis ] _ qualitatively _ follow the turning points of the cylindrical shear alfvn frequency @xmath11 for @xmath12 and @xmath13 respectively ( compare with low - order rationals in figure [ fig : iota ] ) , where the turning points of @xmath14 depend on @xmath7 through @xmath6 and @xmath15 ( the mass density ) , with the average magnetic field strength @xmath16 held constant during a discharge .",

    "these are dominant mode - number assignments as multiple mode - numbers have not yet been resolved from the available data .",
    "assuming the best information available for mass density and using h-1 s average major radius @xmath19  m in the formula for @xmath20 , predicted frequencies were found to be a factor of @xmath21 times larger than measured frequencies .",
    "the discrepancy factor is reduced to @xmath22 if the helical extension of the arclength of the magnetic axis is accounted for by setting @xmath23  m. this discrepancy was not the same for each of the four branches of the two whale - tails and mode localisation assumptions were made for some configurations .",
    "consequently , the value @xmath22 should be taken as a coarse measure of the theory - measurement frequency discrepancy .",
    "the frequency scaling behaviour , which is qualitatively analogous to frequency sweeping of reversed - shear alfvn eigenmodes ( rsae ) as @xmath24 changes in tokamak discharges@xcite , suggests that the low - frequency modes are gaes and non - conventional gaes ( ngaes ) at local minima and maxima in @xmath14 respectively .",
    "the low toroidal currents of h-1 favour the existence of ngaes , whereas rsaes have only been observed in tokamaks during  alfvn cascades \" in which several waves with different mode numbers sweep through a broad frequency range during the course of a discharge , unlike the steady , solitary h-1 modes.@xcite however , no robust explanations have been found for the quantitative discrepancy . while significant impurities are likely to be present in h-1 plasmas , cylindrical frequencies are expected to depend weakly on this effect as @xmath20 is proportional to the inverse square root of the effective mass .",
    "collisions with neutrals are likewise not thought to be able to explain such a large discrepancy.@xcite    cylindrical ideal mhd modelling of gae eigenmodes under h-1 conditions has shown agreement with magnetic attenuation and optical emissions measurements.@xcite however , as that study assumed cylindrical geometry , no comparisons were made with modes other than gaes .",
    "furthermore , that study highlighted the multiply - peaked nature of the fourier spectrum of magnetic phase measurements , pointing to the importance of mode - number coupling in h-1 .",

    "we emphasise ; this temperature profile is not intended to represent the temperature for a single discharge , it represents local temperatures in @xmath181 space postulating a simple linear profile consistent with preliminary spatially resolved electron temperature reconstructions@xcite , assuming @xmath182 .",
    "these temperatures can be used in equation ( [ eq : gamfreqest ] ) to estimate how the @xmath183 branch of @xmath112 evolves with @xmath7 for the @xmath12 shear alfvn branch in the range @xmath174 , which is shown in figure [ fig : gamwhale ] .",
    "comparison of figure [ fig : gamwhale ] with figure [ fig : freqvskappa_davethesis ] shows that baes or baaes excited just below @xmath112 will show a very similar configurational frequency dependence with the left side of the low-@xmath167 whale - tail .     the @xmath183 branch of @xmath112 as a function of @xmath7 based on a postulated hollow total temperature profile . ]",
    "unfortunately the available electron temperature measurements do not extend to the outer flux surfaces ( @xmath184 ) which would be necessary for an explicit comparison of @xmath112 in the range @xmath185 with the left side of the high-@xmath167 whale - tail .",
    "it is clear though that a similar frequency dependence on @xmath7 will be observed provided that the temperature increases accordingly ; that it increases to some degree is fairly certain .",
    "the quasi - discrete modes found in section [ alf_acoustic ] will probably experience enhanced continuum interactions in the presence of the non - constant temperatures used in this section .",
    "whether these interactions will outweigh the relevant driving mechanisms is an important question that requires more detailed physics than ideal - mhd alone provides.@xcite",
    "the linearised ideal mhd spectrum is the starting point for analysis of suspected alfvn wave observations , as the gap structure of that spectrum identifies frequency ranges with reduced continuum damping .",
    "we have presented the three - dimensional , compressible ideal spectrum for h-1 plasmas .",
    "the presence of @xmath0-induced gaps and partial gaps , the existence of discrete modes in these gaps and the predicted configurational dependence of the highest bae gap frequency in the presence of h-1 s hollow temperature profiles can account for important features of wave frequency measurements , namely the left sides of the v - shaped  whale - tail \" frequency structures observed in configuration space .",
    "thus , a potentially complete explanation of the left sides of both whale - tails has been provided .",
    "this  bae hypothesis \" does not , however , provide an explanation for the right sides of the whale - tails as the relevant resonant surface will leave the plasma and the alfvn continuum will rapidly approach higher frequencies .",
    "for example , at @xmath44 the @xmath80 minimum frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : contispect_30_full]b ) is more than twice as large as measurements .",
    "furthermore , no discrete modes were found below the @xmath80 and @xmath81 shear alfvn continuum minima near @xmath186 and @xmath187 ( the right - hand sides of the whale - tails ) .",
    "nevertheless , as quasi - discrete alfvnic modes with dominant mode numbers @xmath80 and @xmath81 could not be found at low - frequencies for @xmath186 and @xmath187 respectively , there do not appear to be any ideal mhd candidates for the right sides of the whale - tails apart from gaes that have had their frequencies lowered by non - ideal effects , or by an effective mass @xmath188 around six times greater near the plasma core than our impurity - free assumption of @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the proton mass .",
    "the factor of six follows from the gae - measurement discrepancy factor which we showed was reduced to @xmath191 when 3-dimensional effects are included .",
    "gae and bae wave physics should be experimentally distinguishable by the fact that only baes are strongly affected by plasma temperature .",
    "this highlights the importance of reliable spatially - resolved temperature measurements which are the subject of future work .",
    "it is important that uncertainty in the effective mass and its radial dependence be reduced , as this parameter affects both shear alfvn and acoustic frequency predictions .",
    "it is hoped that measurements from the new helical mirnov array have the potential to provide multiple mode - number assignments as well as eventually allowing for comparison with eigenmode polarisation predictions .",
    "it may also be possible to obtain accurate spatially resolved measurements of the relative plasma density fluctuations which , when compared with mirnov signals would help in characterising shear alfvn versus acoustic components of the observed wave dynamics .",
    "ultimately , candidate modes should be compared with mirnov array signals and internal measurements for a conclusive identification .",
    "efforts are also underway to obtain energetic particle drive estimates for cas3d eigenfunctions and extend equilibrium and spectral calculations to incorporate a free boundary and vacuum field .",
    "ideal mhd must be interpreted with due caution at low frequencies due to the poor description it provides of compressible motions@xcite , and the omission of thermal ion interactions , such as ion landau damping . for these reasons it may prove fruitful to pursue kinetic models of sub - gam h-1 wave physics.@xcite",
    "we wish to thank carolin nhrenberg for providing cas3d and for many insightful discussions , and axel konies for making conti available to us and for informative email correspondence .",
    "we also thank shaun haskey for providing well - organised magnetic fluctuation data .",
