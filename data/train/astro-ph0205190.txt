    "classical t tauri stars ( cttss ) appear to be roughly solar mass pre - main sequence stars still surrounded by disks of material which actively accrete onto the central star .",
    "it is within such disks that solar systems form .",
    "understanding the processes through which young stars interact with and eventually disperse their disks is critical for understanding the rotational evolution of stars and the formation of planets .",
    "a key question is to understand how young stars can accrete large amounts of disk material with high specific angular momentum , yet maintain rotation rates that are observed to be relatively slow ( e.g. hartmann & stauffer 1989 , edwards et al .",
    "current models state that this process proceeds via magnetospheric accretion : stellar magnetic fields truncate the inner disk and channel accreting material onto the stellar surface , preferentially at high latitude . more generally in astrophysics ,",
    "magnetized accretion onto a central source is a common theme in various contexts including accretion onto white dwarfs ( e.g. am her stars  wickramasinghe & ferrario 2000 ) , pulsars ( pulsating x - ray sources  ghosh & lamb 1979 ) , and possibly black holes at the center of active galactic nuclei ( e.g. koide , shibata , & kudoh 1999 ) . detailed tests of magnetospheric accretion theory are necessary for understanding cttss as well as these other classes of objects .",
    "support for magnetospheric accretion in cttss is significant .",
    "current models can account for the relatively slow rotation of most cttss ( camenzind 1990 ; knigl 1991 ; shu et al .",
    "1994 ; paatz & camenzind 1996 ) .",
    "studies of the spectroscopic and photometric variability of cttss often suggest magnetically controlled accretion ( e.g. bertout , basri , & bouvier 1988 ; bertout et al .",
    "1996 ; herbst , bailer ",
    "jones , & mundt 2001 ; alencar , johns ",
    "krull , & basri 2001 ) with the magnetic axis inclined to the rotation axis in some cases ( e.g. kenyon et al .",
    "1994 , johns  krull & basri 1995 , bouvier et al .",
    "models of high resolution balmer line profiles , computed in the context of magnetospheric accretion , reproduce many aspects of observed line profiles ( muzerolle , calvet , & hartmann 1998 , muzerolle et al .",
    "t tauri stars are observed to be strong x - ray sources indicating the presence of strong magnetic fields on their surfaces ( see feigelson & montmerle 1999 for a review ) , and cttss are observed to have strong surface magnetic fields ( guenther et al .",
    "1999 ; johns  krull et al .",
    "1999b ; johns  krull et al . 2001 ) , and strong magnetic fields have been observed in the formation region of the emission line at 5876   ( johns  krull et al .",
    "1999a ; johns  krull & valenti 2000 ) , which is believed to be produced in a shock near the stellar surface as the disk material impacts the star .    despite these successes ,",
    "open issues remain .",
    "current theoretical models assume a dipole geometry for the stellar magnetic field ; however , johns  krull et al .",
    "( 1999a ) and johns  krull and valenti ( 2001 ) show that the surface fields on bp tau and tw hya are not dipolar . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected that the dipole component of the field should dominate at distance from the star where the interaction with the disk is taking place , so this may not contradict current theory . even in the case of the complex magnetic topology of the sun , the dipole component appears to become dominant at @xmath0 or closer ( e.g. luhmann et al .",
    "1998 ) . for expected disk truncation radii of 3  6 @xmath1 in cttss",
    ", this suggests the dipole component will govern the stellar interaction with the disk . on the other hand , stassun et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find no correlation between rotation period and ir signatures of circumstellar disks in a sample of 254 stars in orion , leading them to question the validity of magnetically mediated disk locking which is intrinsic to magnetosphereic accretion theory .",
    "bertout and mennessier ( 1996 ) review points in favor of both the magnetospheric accretion model and the original axisymmetric , equatorial boundary layer model ( based on the work of lynden  bell & pringle 1974 ) which came before . while the magnetospheric model remains the favorite in the current literature , bertout and mennessier ( 1996 ) conclude that the existing data does not favor either model .",
    "thus , the overall success of magnetospheric accretion as the best description of accretion onto cttss remains in some doubt .",
    "the current equilibrium theories of magnetospheric accretion predict specific relationships between the stellar mass ( @xmath2 ) , radius ( @xmath1 ) , rotation period ( @xmath3 ) , magnetic field ( @xmath4 ) , and mass accretion rate ( @xmath5 ) ( e.g. johns  krull et al .",
    "unfortunately , observation of all these quantities are only available for a handful of stars , with magnetic field measurements the most lacking",
    ". one could look for correlations among the other quantities to test the theories .",
    "ghosh ( 1995 ) investigated the rotation and accretion properties of a number of t tauri stars ( ttss ) by assuming a dynamo relation for tts magnetic fields in terms of rossby number ( convective turnover time divided by rotation period ) since there were almost no magnetic field measurements for ttss available at the time .",
    "ghosh ( 1995 ) found that ttss generally cluster below the limiting rotation rate as is to be expected ; however , no clear correlations were seen in the data .",
    "krull , valenti , and linsky ( 2001 ) have shown that tts rossby numbers generally place them in the region of saturated magnetic activity compared to main sequence and evolved stars , so it is not clear that parameterizing the stellar field in terms of the rossby number is appropriate for these stars .",
    "furthermore , ttss do not show a large range of magnetic field properties as described below . while we are unaware of any other systematic studies along this line , muzerolle , calvet , and hartmann ( 2001 ) note that current theory predicts a correlation between rotation period and mass accretion rate which has not been observed .",
    "muzerolle et al .",
    "( 2001 ) suggest that variations in the stellar magnetic field strength from star to star may account for the lack of correlation .",
    "johns  krull et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that the mean photospheric magnetic fields of 6 ttss range only between 2.1 and 2.7 kg , suggesting a surprising uniformity to the field strengths on these stars .",
    "the field on t tau obtained by guenther et al .",
    "( 1999 ) also falls in this range .",
    "these observations are of the magnetic field averaged over the entire stellar surface , while for the current discussion we are most interested in the field in the actual accretion zones . johns ",
    "krull et al .",
    "( 1999a ) discovered a magnetic field in the 5876  emission line on bp tau from observations of circular polarization , arguing that the narrow component of this line likely forms in the postshock region as material accretes onto the stellar surface ( see also hartmann , hewett , & calvet 1994 and lamzin 1995 ) .",
    "the field detected is 2.5 kg , which is a lower limit to the true field due to the unknown angle between the field lines and the line of sight .",
    "krull et al .",
    "( 2001 ) also present similar spectropolarimetric observations of 4 cttss over 6 nights , finding fields in the line formation region that vary smoothly with time , probably due to stellar rotation which suggests the fields participating in the accretion flow are stable at least on a rotational time scale ( see also valenti , johns ",
    "krull , & hatzes 2001 ) . in all cases ,",
    "the field determined from the polarization is equal to or lower than the mean photospheric field , as is expected if the fields are in fact the same but the measurement is reduced as a result of field line inclination to the line of sight .    as mentioned above , the theoretical relationships predicted by magnetospheric accretion theory involve many parameters , not just rotation period and mass accretion rate .",
    "since all the exisiting observational data suggests relative uniformity of surface magnetic field strengths on cttss ( at least in taurus where the most detailed studies have taken place ) , we have examined several sources of data from the literature to look for the expected correlations assuming the field strength is in fact constant from star to star .",
    "this constancy of the magnetic field may represent some limit to the dynamo operating in these young stars .",
    "certainly , the details of such a dynamo are far from well understood ; however , johns  krull et al .",
    "( 2001 ) show that within the context of other active stars , tts are expected to show saturated magnetic activity based on their rotation and convective parameters , perhaps giving further justification to assuming a constant magnetic field . in ",
    "2 we review the predicted relationships between the various stellar and accretion parameters . in ",
    "3 we examine literature compilations of the requisite parameters for testing the predicted correlations .",
    "section 4 presents the analysis of this data . in  5",
    "we discuss our results , and our conclusions are given in  6 .",
    "johns  krull et al .",
    "( 1999b ) examined three analytic theories ( knigl 1991 , cameron & campbell 1993 , shu et al .",
    "1994 ) of magnetospheric accretion , presenting equations for the stellar magnetic field strength as a function of @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and @xmath5 .",
    "these studies are outgrowths of the pioneering work done by ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ) on accreting neutron stars .",
    "the work of knigl ( 1991 ) and cameron and campbell ( 1993 ) are very closely related to that of ghosh and lamb ( 1979 ) in that these papers only consider accretion onto the star .",
    "the shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) work is different in that it is an integrated theory of accretion onto the central star plus a wind which is driven off the disk at the truncation point ( the x - region ) . while coefficients representing such things as the efficiency of magnetic coupling to the disk vary from one study to the other , the predictions from knigl ( 1991 ) and shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) depended in the same way on the above stellar and accretion parameters for an assumed dipolar magnetic field . holding the stellar magnetic field constant , knigl ( 1991 ) and shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) predict that @xmath6 in the case of cameron and campbell ( 1993 ) , the relationship is @xmath7 which is very similar in its dependencies to knigl ( 1991 ) and shu et al .",
    "in fact , scatter plots created using equation ( 2 ) are virtually identical to those created using equation ( 1 ) .",
    "therefore , we only show plots based on equation ( 1 ) ; however , the results for equation ( 2 ) are cited in the tables and discussed in the text .    in a more detailed analysis of",
    "the magnetospheric accretion flow itself , ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) identified the importance of the notion of trapped flux in the shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) theory . while still assuming a dipole stellar field , ostriker and shu noted that what their theory really predicted was the amount of magnetic flux trapped in the x - region . in their preferred model",
    ", this is 1.5 times the magnetic flux which would thread the disk exterior to the truncation point ( the co - rotation radius in their model ) in an undisturbed dipole field . for the system to remain in equilibrium , this is the flux that must be trapped in the x - region independent of the topology of the magnetic field on the stellar surface .",
    "armed with this information , we can derive a new relationship among the observable parameters which is unique to the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) treatment of the shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) theory .",
    "re - writing equation ( 4.1 ) of ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) for the radius of the x - point , @xmath8 , we have @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant evaluated by ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) to be 0.923 in their preferred model , @xmath11 is the dipole moment of the star , @xmath12 the gravitational constant , and @xmath13 is the mass accretion rate through the disk . the general form of this equation is well known from many studies of accretion onto compact objects ( see for example white & stella 1988 ) . in the shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) theory , the disk mass accretion rate is not equal to the accretion rate onto the star ( the quantity measured in the observations described below ) since the theory also incorporates a magnetocentrifugally driven wind from the x - region ; however , the two are related by a factor of order 2/3 .    for a purely dipolar field ,",
    "the magnetic flux threading the disk exterior to the point @xmath8 is @xmath14 in the preferred model of ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) the total flux trapped in the x - region is @xmath15 , of which a third participates in the accretion funnel flow of material onto the star ( another third is in the dead zone , and the final third is part of the wind ) .",
    "thus , the magnetic flux threading the x - region which directs disk material onto the star is @xmath16 independent of the exact topology of the field at the stellar surface , as long as the dipole dominates in the x - region . equating this magnetic flux to that on the star in the accretion zones",
    ", we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the area on the surface of the star on which the accreting disk material falls .    if we recall that @xmath8 in the shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) theory is the co - rotation radius , where the keplerian angular velocity in the disk is equal to the angular velocity of stellar rotation , we can solve equation ( 5 ) for @xmath11 , substitute the result into equation ( 3 ) and get @xmath19 after some manipulation . in this paper , we assume @xmath4 does not vary from star to star and @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the filling factor of accretion zones , so equation ( 6 ) implies @xmath22 as a unique prediction of the shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) theory as detailed by ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) and expanded here to incorporate a non - dipole field topology near the stellar surface . in equation",
    "( 7 ) , @xmath5 is the mass accretion rate onto the star and @xmath23 where @xmath24 since the wind carries away about one third of the _ disk _ accretion rate ( shu et al .",
    "hartigan , edwards , and ghandour ( 1995 ) attempted to observationally determine the ratio of mass loss to mass accretion rate , finding a value of 0.01 ; however , more recent estimates of this ratio are @xmath25 ( see review of knigl & pudritz 2000 ) so the shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) value seems quite reasonable given the current state of the observations .",
    "in equation ( 7 ) above , the filling factor , @xmath21 , is the filling factor of the accretion spots on the stellar surface , which is not the same as the filling factor of the magnetic field . in the theories which use a strict dipole field geometry in which the magnetic axis is aligned with the rotation axis ( the typical assumption ) ,",
    "the magnetic filling factor is 1.0 , but accretion onto the star occurs only in axisymmetric rings located at high latitude .",
    "thus the filling factor of accretion zones is expected to be significantly less than 1.0 , and its value is strongly influenced by the small scale topology of the magnetic field at the stellar surface .",
    "on the other hand , it is the bright accretion shock emission produced in these regions which is believed to give rise to the uv continuum excess and optical veiling emission seen in cttss ( e.g. calvet & gullbring 1998 ) . as a result",
    ", it is possible to observationally determine @xmath21 , and this has been done for reasonably large samples of stars by valenti , basri , and johns ( 1993 ) and calvet and gullbring ( 1998 ) . as discussed further below , accurate estimates of @xmath21 are required to test the correlations predicted by equation ( 7 ) , and these estimates can be difficult to make .",
    "in this paper we focus on the above mentioned theories since they are largely analytic and permit the derivation of relatively simple expressions which show the dependence of stellar and accretion parameters on one another in the equilibrium situation . these expressions can be tested in a rather straightforward way using existing observational data .",
    "this is not to suggest that the above studies are the only such studies of magnetospheric accretion in cttss .",
    "there are a number of others , some of which derive their results from numerical studies of the governing equations ( e.g. paatz & camenzind 1996 ) , while some focus on the instabilities that can result between the star , its magnetosphere , and the disk which may launch winds and jets ( e.g. hayashi , shibata , & matsumoto 1996 ; goodson , winglee , & bhm 1997 ; miller & stone 1997 ; goodson , bhm , & winglee 1999 ; ferreira , pelletier , & appl 2000 ) .",
    "these studies are not directly testable in the fashion explored in this paper ; however , important tests of many of these works may be possible with variability studies ( see goodson et al .",
    "finally , we note that cttss are variable as has been mentioned in  1 .",
    "this variability is not accounted for in the equilibrium theories examined in this paper , but is not necessarily evidence that these theories should be abandoned .",
    "the theories may be perfectly adequate to describe the average conditions of cttss . in this case",
    ", we expect to see the predicted correlations in the data , and the variability ( as well as measurement error ) should produce scatter about the mean relations .",
    "it is these correlations we are looking for here .",
    "the goal of this paper is test the proportionalities predicted in equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 7 ) by using data from the literature to look for the predicted correlations . for consistency within each of the studies we employ , we use the stellar and accretion parameters from each individual study when testing for the predicted correlations instead of trying to come up with a single best estimate for each of the relevant parameters .",
    "the rotation periods are all taken from photometric monitoring studies which do not depend on these stellar parameters , so we apply the detected periods to all the accretion data sets .",
    "mass accretion rates onto large samples of cttss have been estimated by valenti et al .",
    "( 1993  hereafter vbj ) ; hartigan , edwards , and ghandour ( 1995  hereafter heg ) ; gullbring et al .",
    "( 1998  hereafter ghbc ) ; calvet and gullbring ( 1998  hereafter cg98 ) ; and white and ghez ( 2001  hereafter wg01 ) . of these papers , only vbj and cg98 estimate the filling factor , @xmath21 , of accreting material on the stellar surface , which is required to test the relationship given in equation ( 7 ) .",
    "cg98 do not separately estimate , @xmath26 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 , instead using the values tabulated by ghbc which are reproduced in the tables here .",
    "for the 4 continuum stars ( cw tau , dg tau , dl tau , and dr tau ) from cg98 which are used in this study , cg98 _ assume _ @xmath27 and @xmath28 , which we use here .",
    "in addition , cg98 do not tabulate @xmath5 specifically , but the mass loss rate can be calculated from their equation ( 11 ) and the quantities tabulated in the paper .",
    "we note that in cg98 , they do not perform a detailed fit to the data presented in ghbc , instead adopting the values from their grid of models which gives the best fit to the data as estimated by eye .",
    "however , this should be adequate for our purpose of looking for general correlations among different parameters .",
    "rotation period data comes from the following papers in order of preference : bouvier et al .",
    "1995 , bouvier 1990 , bertout et al .",
    "1996 , and bouvier et al . 1993 .",
    "tables 1 through 5 give the final compilation of stars and their relevant parameters for the 5 studies examined here . in a few cases ( noted in the tables ) ,",
    "required quantities such as the stellar radius are not tabulated in the original studies , but can be estimated from the tabulated stellar luminosity and effective temperature .",
    "for those studies which only tabulate spectral type , the spectral type  effective temperature calibration of johnson ( 1966 ) is used in this paper to estimate @xmath26 .",
    "some of the stars used in this study are now known to be binary , while this was not known to be the case in earlier studies .",
    "in addition , pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks have been refined over time , which influences the derivation of stellar parameters .",
    "for many of the binaries , their separation is large enough ( dk tau , gk tau , rw aur ) that they do not fall in the slit used by heg , while wg01 explicitly take into account the binary nature of these stars . for the studies based on low to medium resolution spectroscopy ( vbj , ghbc , cg98 ) , the slits used were wide enough to encompass both members of the binary systems .",
    "however , it is generally the case ( df tau , dk tau , gg tau a , rw aur ) that the primary star dominates the optical and short wavelength light ( mathieu 1994 ; ghez , white , & simon 1997 ; duchene et al .",
    "1999 ; wg01 ) from which the accretion parameters are derived . as a result , the accretion rates and filling factors apply to the primary in the case of those stars with originally unknown companions .",
    "inclusion of the wg01 results in this study will also serve to see if accurate accounting for binarity significantly changes the results . the use of different pre - main sequence tracks and differences in the extinction corrections used ( as well as unknown binaries ) between the different studies results in small ( generally less than a factor of 2 ) changes in the stellar mass and radius from one study to the other , but these differences are small compared to the full range of parameters explored in the samples .",
    "we choose to use the samples as is since changes made in one parameter can also affect others ( such as the mass accretion rate ) , so here we hope to maintain consistent sets of parameters from one study to the next as we look for general correlations among the parameters .",
    "in addition to observational issues related to the influence of binaries , it is fair to consider the theoretical influence of binary interactions .",
    "this paper is concerned with the star - disk interaction , and the theories examined here have the disk accretion rate as a free parameter .",
    "therefore , if cttss in binaries have different disk accretion rates compared to single cttss , this difference should naturally be accounted for .",
    "theoretical effects studied in ctts binary systems inlclude disk truncation and circumbinary replenishment ( e.g. artymowicz & lubow 1994 , 1996 ) and changes to disk accretion rates ( e.g. ostriker , shu , & adams 1992 ) , but most authors consider the star - disk interaction to be the same as for single cttss ( e.g. armitage , clarke , & tout 1999 ) .",
    "observationally , wg01 find no difference in the accretion rate as a function of binary separation in the range 10 - 1000 au , and simon & prato ( 1995 ) find no difference in disk lifetime between binary and single cttss .",
    "thus , it is unlikely there is any real difference in the star - disk interaction for cttss in relatively wide binaries such as those considered here compared to single cttss . as a result",
    ", we include both single cttss and cttss in binaries in the current analysis , but we separate them by plot symbol for clarity .",
    "stars identified as binary in wg01 , mathieu ( 1994 ) , or ghez , neugebauer , and matthews ( 1993 ) are labelled as binary ; while stars indicated as single in wg01 are labelled so here .",
    "as mentioned above , vbj and cg98 are the only studies which determine the filling factor , a necessary quantity for testing equation ( 7 ) .",
    "generally speaking , the mass accretion rate is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the density of the infalling material and @xmath31 is the velocity at which it is coming in .",
    "therefore , @xmath32 heg , ghbc , and wg01 all give @xmath5 and either @xmath1 or the data necessary to derive it .",
    "one could either simply take single representative values for @xmath30 and @xmath31 or try to estimate them individually for each star . in either case",
    "though , the value of @xmath21 determined depends explicitly on the mass accretion rate .",
    "therefore , one would naturally expect a good correlation between the left and right side of equation ( 7 ) since @xmath5 appears on both sides .",
    "we have estimated @xmath21 from equation ( 9 ) and do indeed find good correlations for equation ( 7 ) , but this can not be viewed as support for our extended version of the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model , so we do not include these plots for the data of heg , ghbc , or wg01 .    in summary",
    "then , we use data from 5 observational studies to look for the correlations predicted in equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 7 ) . of these",
    ", 3 studies do not independently determine the filling factor of accretion spots , @xmath21 , and therefore are only suitable to test the relationships of the simple ( dipole ) accretion theories embodied in equation ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "these three studies are heg , ghbc , and wg01 .",
    "the investigations of vbj and cg98 do independently estimate @xmath21 and are therefore suitable for testing the prediction of our modified ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model , as well as the predictions of the simple models .",
    "thus , vbj and cg98 can be used to test equations ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , and ( 7 ) .",
    "figures 1a , 2 , 3 , 4a , and 5 show the results for the data from the 5 studies when looking for the correlation predicted by equation ( 1 ) , which results from assuming a dipole magnetic field geometry with a constant field strength from star to star following knigl ( 1991 ) , shu et al .",
    "( 1994  and the unmodified ostriker and shu 1995 theory ) . in each figure , the quantity on the right hand side of the equation ( 1 ) is plotted versus the quantity on the left hand side of the equation . for simplicity in the plot units",
    ", we have expressed the stellar mass and radius in solar units for each star , and the mass accretion rate in units of @xmath33 m@xmath34 yr@xmath35 . as mentioned above , the scatter plots which result from equation ( 2 ) following cameron and campbell ( 1993 ) look almost identical to those shown in these figures and are therefore not shown separately .",
    "filled circle plot symbols denote single cttss , and asterisks denote cttss in binary systems . in all the figures ,",
    "the expected correlation is shown with a dashed line . for those plots which do show a significant correlation ( see below ) ,",
    "the best fit line is shown in a solid line .",
    "in general , the expected relationship for equation ( 1 ) is only weakly present , with the data of heg showing the strongest correlation .",
    "we quantify these results by computing the linear correlation coefficient ( also known as pearson s @xmath36 ) and its associated false alarm probability , @xmath37 ( press et al . 1986 ) . for each investigation ,",
    "the associated correlation coefficient and false alarm probability are computed by using the logarithm of the quantities on each axis of the plots , thus giving the linear correlation of the scatter plots actually shown in these log - log plots .",
    "this is done to prevent the calculation of the correlation from being overly influenced by one or a few points with very large values on either axes .",
    "the resulting correlation coefficients and false alarm probabilities are given in table [ corr ] .",
    "it is readily apparent from this table that when testing the correlations predicted by equations ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) , only the heg data produces a false alarm probability @xmath38 , which is typically indicative of a real correlation .",
    "the data of heg give @xmath39 in the case of equation ( 2 ) , suggestive of a significant correlation . the best fit line ( solid line in the plot ) is determined from a standard least squares analysis , assuming each data point has the same uncertainty in the y - axis quantity . to estimate the uncertainty in the slope ( predicted to be 1 by the theory )",
    ", we then use the best fit line to estimate observed residuals for each point .",
    "the standard deviation of these residuals is then assumed to be the @xmath40 uncertainty of each point in the y - axis quantity , which in turn gives an uncertainty for the slope in the least squares fit .",
    "given the number of potential uncertainties that go into estimating the error bars for the points in each figure , we feel this means of estimating the final uncertainty of the slope from the scatter plots is the least biassed .",
    "the slope and its uncertainty are given in table [ corr ] for that equation [ ( 1 ) , ( 2 ) , or ( 7 ) discussed below ] which produces the best correlation for each data set . for the case of heg data and equation ( 2 ) , the slope is @xmath41 which is insignificantly different from the expected value of 1.0 .        figures 1b and 4b show the results for the data from vbj and cg98 respectively when looking for the correlation predicted by equation ( 7 ) , which results from using the trapped flux concept of ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) while abandoning a pure dipole magnetic field geometry and assuming a constant stellar magnetic field strength .",
    "the plot symbols have the same meaning as given above , as do the solid and dashed lines .",
    "both of these plots show much stronger correlations than present in the data when testing equations ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",
    "this is also apparent in the correlation coefficients and false alam probabilities given table [ corr ] .",
    "also given in the table is the best fit slope and uncertainty calculated in the same way as described above .",
    "the expected slope is 1.0 and the vbj data give this slope to within the uncertainties .",
    "the cg98 data give a slope substantially below this expected value .",
    "this low slope is largely driven by the two stars with the lowest values of @xmath42 ; however , excluding them still gives a slope which is too low at the @xmath43 level .",
    "this gives some concern , but as mentioned before ( and discussed further below ) , cg98 do not actually fit their models to the observations , indicating that their study may not be the best suited for strictly testing the predicted correlations . nevertheless , it is certainly true that equation ( 7 ) produces far better correlations in the data than either equations ( 1 ) or ( 2 ) .",
    "the data from both vbj and cg98 appears to support the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) theory as extended here to include non - dipole field topologies , while the data from all 5 observational studies at best only weakly supports the other magnetospheric accretion theories . as a result , it is important to look closely at vbj and cg98 to see just how well they agree with equation ( 7 ) .",
    "we also note from equation ( 8) that generally , @xmath5 depends on @xmath44 , so there should be some correlation between these quantities .",
    "the observations primarily determine the accretion luminosity , @xmath45 , which is then used to determine the mass accretion rate either directly by applying an equation of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 depends on whether accretion occurs through an equatorial boundary layer or through a magnetospeher ; or a model is used in the case of cg98 to fit the accretion luminosity and the resulting parameters give the mass accretion rate . at the same time , the filling factor , @xmath21 , is usually determined from the equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the emission per unit area from the accretion zones and is determined by fitting the observations to a model , either a hydrogen slab model in the case of vbj or a shock model for cg98 .",
    "thus , both the determination of @xmath5 and @xmath21 primarily depend on @xmath45 and the value of @xmath1 .",
    "therefore , it is important to see how well @xmath5 is correlated with @xmath1 ( or @xmath50 , but when looking at the log of the quantities , it does not matter which power is considered when evaluating the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath1 ) and @xmath21 separately , as well as with the product @xmath42 to see if the correlations seen in figures 1b and 4b are driven by these potential correlations .",
    "indeed , cg98 point out that @xmath21 appears to be well correlated with @xmath5 in their study , making this a real concern . on the other hand",
    ", we already know that @xmath5 is not too well correlated with @xmath1 since the top two panels in each figure do not show strong correlations .    in table [ closer ]",
    "we give the correlation coefficients and resulting false alarm probabilities when comparing log(@xmath51 ) to log(@xmath21 ) , log(@xmath50 ) and log(@xmath44 ) using the data from vbj and cg98 .",
    "these correlations are to be compared with the values in the last two columns of table [ corr ] which gives the correlation coefficient and false alarm probability when comparing all the parameters relevant to our extended ostriker an shu theory [ log(@xmath52 ) versus log(@xmath44 ) ] . in the case of vbj",
    ", there is no correlation between the mass accretion rate and the filling factor , some between @xmath5 and @xmath50 and a real correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath44 , but the full ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) comparison ( table [ corr ] ) produces the best correlation .",
    "thus , it appears that the inclusion of the rotation period and the mass do improve the results as predicted by the theory .",
    "the case is not quite the same for cg98 , with the @xmath5 showing the best correlation with @xmath44 , but the correlation based on equation ( 7 ) is nearly as high .",
    "it is certainly true that the cg98 shock model is the most physical of the two studies ; however , cg98 do not actually fit the observed data , but pick by the eye the closest model from their grid to match the observations .",
    "it is also apparent from their figure 6 that they do not generally match the observations ( particularly the slope of the paschen continuum ) as well as vbj , so it can not be assumed that their values for various accretion parameters are more accurate .",
    "we can look further at the results of vbj .",
    "we substitute equation ( 10 ) into equation ( 7 ) to eliminate @xmath5 and then use equation ( 11 ) to eliminate @xmath21 .",
    "dropping constants and re - arranging , we then find @xmath53 in the case of vbj , @xmath49 is determined by a model fit and its value is largely driven by the shape of the paschen continuum and the size of the balmer jump .",
    "equation ( 12 ) above involves parameters which are independently determined to the greatest extent possible within the context of the vbj study .",
    "the accretion luminosity is given by vbj and we reproduce these in table [ vbjt ] for each star . since we have access to the models used by vbj , we compute @xmath49 by integrating over wavelength the excess flux produced by the best fitting hydrogen slab model for each star and also give these values in table [ vbjt ] .",
    "we note that vbj do not estimate @xmath21 using equation ( 11 ) .",
    "use of this equation with values of @xmath49 from table [ vbjt ] to estimate @xmath21 produce values which are systematically larger that those given by vbj .",
    "the model of vbj used the observations to determine the filling factor of the visible hemisphere ( @xmath54 ) covered by the boundary layer ( accretion zones ) .",
    "the systematic difference between the two estimates of @xmath21 reflect the unknown forshortening of the emitting region if it is not located at disk center on the stellar surface .",
    "this depends on the exact topology of the accretion and the limb darkening that should be applied .",
    "the two estimates of @xmath21 are extremely well correlated with each other and using values estimated from equation ( 11 ) produces a correlation in figure [ vbjf]b very similar to that shown .",
    "however , there are still worries that @xmath21 and @xmath5 may show an aritifical correlation , so testing the relationship given in equation ( 12 ) is a better test of our modified version of the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) theory .",
    "figure [ best ] shows the two sides of equation ( 12 ) plotted against one another , showing an excellent correlation .",
    "the resulting correlation coefficient is @xmath55 with an associated false alarm probability of @xmath56 .",
    "a least squares analysis finds a best fit line ( shown in solid ) in the log - log plot with a slope of @xmath57 which is not significantly different from the predicted slope of 1.0 ( shown in the dashed line ) .",
    "we are unable to repeat this analysis for cg98 since we do not have access to their models .",
    "we can do a similar exercise for the data showing the highest correlation for the other magnetospheric accretion theories .",
    "examining table [ corr ] , the data from heg may show a possible correlation when used to test equation ( 2 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the heg data shows a correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath1 with @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "again , using equation ( 10 ) to eliminate @xmath60 from equation ( 2 ) gives ( after dropping constants ) @xmath61 heg tabulate @xmath45 for each star which we also give in table [ hegt ] . using the heg data to test equation ( 13 ) shows only a very weak correlation , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "the data are shown in figure [ bestheg ] and the slope is @xmath64 .    in summary",
    ", it appears both vbj and cg98 are consistent with our extended version of the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) theory , but the correlation given by cg98 may be the result of the generally expected correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath65 .",
    "the data from vbj actually show the best correlation when considering all the parameters required by the theory , and the data from this study shows an excellent correlation with the theory when one tries to remove the dependence of various parameters on each other .",
    "there is only weak support for the more general magnetospheric accretion theories of knigl ( 1991 ) , cameron and campbell ( 1993 ) , shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , and ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) without the extensions described above for considering non - dipole field geometeries .",
    "the above results suggest the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) formulation can be shown to be consistent with the data if the strict dipole field geometry is dropped and it is assumed that the stellar magnetic field is basically constant from one ctts to another .",
    "ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) state that one prediction of their work is that smaller cttss should have smaller filling factors of accretion spots on their surface .",
    "thus we might expect @xmath21 and @xmath1 to be directly related to one another . on the other hand",
    ", the relationship given in equation ( 7 ) above clearly predicts that @xmath21 and @xmath1 should be inversely related to one another .",
    "this apparent contradiction deserves some comment .",
    "this result can be understood in terms of our equation ( 6 ) , which was derived assuming a dipole field geometry in the vicinity of the truncation point of the disk , but which maps back to an arbitrarily complex field topology at the stellar surface .",
    "this equation certainly holds for a pure dipole as used by ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) . remembering that @xmath20 , we can re - write equation ( 6 ) as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a constant , @xmath68 .",
    "if we now assume the field is a pure dipole as ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) do in their default model , then @xmath69 where @xmath11 is the dipole moment of the star and @xmath70 is a small positive number ( @xmath71 ) which takes into account the fact that as the stellar radius decreases , the relevant field lines which thread the disk truncation region in the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model are closer to the pole where the field strength is stronger . putting this into equation ( 14 ) above yields : @xmath72 after some re - arrangement . holding other things constant , you expect a direct relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath1 as stated by ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) .",
    "however , in our extension of the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) theory to non - dipole field geometries at the stellar surface , equation ( 7 ) above clearly predicts an inverse relationship between @xmath21 and @xmath1 if the magnetic field strength at the stellar surface is held constant along with the stellar mass , rotation period , and the mass accretion rate . in a log - log plot of @xmath21 versus @xmath1 , equation ( 7 ) predicts a linear relationship with a slope of -2 .",
    "figure [ frstar ] shows the relationship between the accretion filling factor , @xmath21 , and the stellar radius , @xmath1 , for three data samples .",
    "the top panel uses the data given in table [ cg98 t ] from cg98 .",
    "this panel shows no correlation bewteen the two quantities .",
    "this may simply reflect the fact that the other relevant parameters ( @xmath2 , @xmath5 , @xmath3 ) must also be considered simultaneously ; however , as mentioned above , the cg98 analysis does not strictly fit the observations , and in some case does not match the continuum slopes well .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ frstar ] shows the vbj data from table [ vbjt ] . in this case",
    "an inverse correlation is observed : the correlation coefficient is @xmath73 with an associated false alarm probability of @xmath74 . in a",
    "least squares analysis where we again use the distribution around the best fit line to estimate the uncertainty , the best fit slope is @xmath75 , which is not significantly different from the predicted value of @xmath76 .",
    "the best fit is shown in a solid line , and the best fit with an assumed slope of @xmath76 is shown in the dashed line .",
    "one can test this relation using significantly more data points by using the entire sample of vbj .",
    "the required filling factors are taken from table 5 of vbj , and the stellar radii are calculated from the stellar luminosities given in table 5 of vbj and the spectral types given in table 1 of vbj . again , to translate spectral type into effective temperature , we use the calibration given by johnson ( 1966 ) . this entire data set consists of 43 stars which are plotted in the bottom panel of figure [ frstar ] .",
    "this figure again shows an obvious correlation which is borne out statistically ( @xmath77 ; @xmath78 ) . the best fit line ( solid ) has a slope of @xmath79 , which again in not significantly different from the predicted value of @xmath76 ( shown in the dashed line ) .",
    "we also see that in the entire data sample there is a large amount of scatter , particularly at the radius corresponding to the stars in the cg98 sample .",
    "some of the scatter is likely due to the inherent variability of ctts and some may also be due to the fact figure [ frstar ] ignores the effects of other stellar parameters on the correlation .",
    "figure [ frstar ] also illustrates the need for a large data sample when making comparisons of this sort .",
    "the fact that we do see the predicted correlation in the full data set of vbj with a slope very close to the predicted value suggests that our extension of the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) theory may be a realistic way to relate the magnetic field in the x - region to the stellar surface .",
    "on the other hand , we note that there is an observational bias that also predicts @xmath80 , which is shown in equation ( 11 ) . for a larger star , a smaller filling factor of accretion shock emission",
    "is required to give the same area of emitting material , and hence the same luminosity , independent of exactly how the accreting material falls to the stellar surface .",
    "while the observed correlation is completely consistent with the predicition of our extended ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model , it also suffers from a potential observational bias .",
    "figure 6 , based on equation ( 12 ) , remains the strictest test of our modification to the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model , and it shows the best correlation found in this study .",
    "the model of magnetically controlled accretion onto a compact object is encountered in many astrophysical contexts . in the case of cttss , such magnetospheric accretion appears to explain many of the properties of these stars ; however , the general relationships between stellar and accretion parameters predicted by the theory has not been demonstrated observationally . in this paper , we use compilations of rotation periods and studies of accretion onto cttss from 5 sources ( vbj , hec , ghbc , cg98 , wg01 ) to test the general predictions of 4 analytic magnetospheric accretion models ( knigl 1991 , cameron & campbell 1993 , shu et al .",
    "1994 , and ostriker & shu 1995 ) .",
    "all the theoretical studies assume a dipole configuration for the stellar magnetic field ; however , ostriker and shu s ( 1995 ) detailed analysis of the shu et al .",
    "( 1994 ) theory does not demand it .",
    "this treatment identifies the essential quantity of the trapped magnetic flux in the x - region , and this same amount of magnetic flux must thread the stellar surface in the accretion zones , independent of the exact magnetic topology on the stellar surface .    while magnetic field measurements for cttss are not numerous , those that are available show a surprising uniformity of the mean stellar field strength from star to star ( guenther et al . 1999 , johns  krull et al .",
    "1999b , johns  krull et al . 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we have assumed a constant magnetic field from star to star and used data from the literature to look for the predicted correlations among stellar and accretion parameters which follow from the above mentioned theories .",
    "we suggest that a physical reason for the constancy of magnetic fields from one star to the other lies in a limit to the efficiency of the dynamo operating in these fully convective stars . generally , the predicted correlations are absent or very weak in the data .",
    "this is also true of the strict ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) theory as applied to a pure dipole magnetic field geometry . on the other hand , ostriker and shu ( 1995 )",
    "introduce the concept of the trapped flux , which allows one to abandon a strict dipole field geometry and still use the theory to make testable predictions ( equations 6 and 7 ) . in order to test these predictions , the filling factor , @xmath21 , of the accreting material on the stellar surface",
    "is required .",
    "the studies of vbj and cg98 are the only two considered here which present values for @xmath21 .",
    "for the stars in common in tables [ vbjt ] and [ cg98 t ] , there is a large range in derived value of @xmath21 between the two studies for some stars .",
    "however , it is well known that cttss are quite variable , showing both rotational modulation of accretion signatures ( e.g. vrba et al .",
    "1993 , johns & basri 1995 , bouvier et al . 1999 ) as well as longer timescale variations in their accretion properties .",
    "in fact , ardila and basri ( 2000 ) find variations in the filling factor on bp tau with a full range from @xmath81 , a factor ( 42 ) comparable to the extremes found between vbj and cg98 .",
    "this suggests that the filling factor on cttss can vary substantially , which may account for much of the difference in the filling factors found by vbj and cg98 . on the other hand , for the stars in tables [ vbjt ] and [ cg98 t ] , the filling factors derived by vbj are larger by a median factor of 3.5 than those found by cg98 , which may reflect a small systematic difference in the two studies . for their default model , ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) predict a filling factor @xmath82 , comparable in value to many of the observed values .",
    "more reliable values of the filling factor would provide more stringent tests of the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model .",
    "gmez de castro and lamzin ( 1999 ) show that analysis of ultraviolet ( uv ) emission lines in conjunction with shock models may result in tight constraints on accretion parameters .",
    "these results are promising , since the uv emission lines arise from the shock itself , as opposed to the photons being reprocessed through the photosphere as in the case of the optical excess studied by all five groups whose results are used in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , the uv analysis has not yet proceeded to the point required to test the current magnetospheric accretion theories .",
    "the data in hand ( figures 1b and 4b ) show much stronger correlations relative to the pure dipole accretion theories , with the vbj data fully consistent with the predictions of equation ( 7 ) .",
    "uncertainties and variations in @xmath21 ( as well as the other relevant parameters including @xmath3 ) likely contribute to much of the observed scatter in the plots",
    ".    a closer look at the vbj and cg98 data show that the vbj data does support the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model when as many of the interdependencies of the various parameters as possible are removed .",
    "the cg98 data suggests that its apparent support for the extended ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model may be the result of the expected correlation between the mass accretion rate and the area of the star participating in the accretion flow . on the other hand ,",
    "none of the other magnetospheric accretion theories are well supported by the existing data , making the our extension of the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) description the most viable of the current analytic theories .",

    "we again note that this generally happens in the case of the solar magnetic field at @xmath84 ( luhmann et al .",

    "we have just argued that the magnetic fields of cttss are not large scale dipoles and that the dipole component of cttss is significantly smaller than required by the magnetospheric accretion models of knigl ( 1991 ) , cameron & campbell ( 1993 ) , and shu et al .",

    "( 1999b , 2001 ) evidence is found for a range of field strengths on the surface of cttss , and we are unable to specify the field strength only in the accretion zone . the polarization data of johns  krull and valenti ( 2000 ) and valenti et al .",
    "( 2001 ) probably probes the field in the accretion zone at the stellar surface , but there is an unknown inclination of this field to the line of sight which reduces the observed field strength below the actual field value . with these caveats ,",
    "the predicted and observed field strengths agree to within a factor of 2 - 3 , with the predictions using the parameters of vbj generally falling below those based on the parameters of cg98 in this sample of 3 stars . except for the rotation period ,",
    "these two studies find different values for all the relevant parameters in equation ( 11 ) ; however , the one which is most significant in producing the difference in the predicted field strengths is the filling factor , @xmath21 .",
    "cttss are know to vary due to rotational modulation .",
    "in addition , there are also likely to be real changes in the instantaneous accretion rate onto the star ( e.g. ardila & basri 2000 ) . both processes could change the apparent filling factor of accreting material . as a result ( and as mentioned above ) , it is not clear that the difference in the derived filling factor values between vbj and cg98 is significant or simply the result of the variability of these stars .    finally , we note that the relationships set forth in this paper are based on equilibrium calculations , while cttss do show substantial variation . as a result , we expect that the relationships should hold for the mean value of the relevant parameters ( particularly the accretion rate ) , but probably do not describe the relationship between these parameters as they vary over relatively short timescales ( compared to the evolutionary timescale of cttss and their disks ) .",
    "for example , ardila and basri ( 2000 ) study the accretion variability of the cttss bp tau , finding that @xmath90 . at first",
    ", this appears to contradict equation ( 7 ) .",
    "rotational modulation may produce some of the variation observed by ardila and basri ( 2000 ) . aside from this , over the timescale of the variations in the instantaneous accretion rate studied by ardila and basri ( 2000 ) , it is doubtful that the star reached a new equilibrium rotation rate which it would be expected to do .",
    "in other words , the torque balance on the star may also be varying , alternately trying to speed it up or slow it down , all the time varying around the equilibrium value .",
    "we would only expect equation ( 7 ) to hold for the mean values , as it seems to based on the correlation plots presented in this paper .",
    "indeed , some of the scatter seen in these plots is likely to result from the intrinsic variability displayed by cttss .",
    "the magnetospheric accretion model can explain many observed features of cttss .",
    "equilibrium models of this process have relied primarily on dipole field geometries to explore the interaction of the star with the disk , which seems appropriate since the dipole component should dominate at large distance from the star .",
    "observations suggest that the magnetic fields of cttss do not change much from star to star , though further observations are needed to confirm this . under the assumption that the fields do not vary",
    "strongly , equilibrium theories predict specific correlations between stellar and accretion parameters which are generally not observed .",
    "this may mean that equilibrium theories are simply not adequate , or that a dipole field topology is too simple an assumption for relating observable parameters .",
    "on the other hand , we can use the notion of trapped flux introduced by ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) to extend this equilibrium theory to non - dipole field topologies at the stellar surface .",
    "the extension we make relies on assuming that the dipole component of the magnetic field does dominate at the x - region in the ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model and that their analysis is accurate in terms of the accounting of how much magnetic flux is in the accretion flow , the dead zone , and the wind .",
    "this determines the magnetic flux in the accretion flow which we assume maps back to an equal amount of magnetic flux on the stellar surface . again holding the magnetic field constant , new correlations are predicted bewteen stellar and accretion parameters .",
    "we argue that the data of vbj are the best suited for looking for these correlations , and that they are apparent in the data .",
    "this suggests that equilibrium models are adequate to describe the general features of magnetospheric accretion in cttss once the dipole field assumption is dropped .",
    "additional tests of our modified ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) model will confirm or refute this .",
    "particularly valuable tests would be to determine all the relevant stellar and accretion parameters for stars with substantially different stellar properties than the taurus stars used here .",
    "for example , detailed observations ( including magnetic field measurements ) of the more rapidly rotating cttss in orion could provide critical tests of equation ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) .",
    "tests of these equations will also benefit from better estimates of accretion rates and filling factors which may result from the analysis of uv emission lines produced in the accretion shock ( e.g. gmez de castro & lamzin 1999 ) . until then",
    ", it appears that our modified ostriker and shu ( 1995 ) is a reasonable description of magnetospheric accretion onto cttss .",

    "<S> their identification of the trapped flux as an important quantity in the model appears to be critical for reconciling the observed data to the theory . </S>",
    "<S> while the data do generally support the extended ostriker and shu predictions , only one of the two studies for which the requisite data exist show the highest correlation when considering all the relevant parameters . </S>",
