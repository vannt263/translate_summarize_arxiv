    "here we only focus on the coupling part of the hamiltonian and start with a simple case .",
    "first it is straightforward to write the hamiltonian @xcite for only two charge qubits as @xmath98 with @xmath99 defined as in  ( [ bi ] ) . in the case of three qubits ,",
    "the loop in the middle can be viewed as a parallel connection of two inductive coils with a mutual inductance @xmath100 between them . in order to get a small value of the equivalent inductance ,",
    "the two identical inductive coils are deliberately connected in an opposite configuration .",
    "we also make an applicable assumption that the values of @xmath100 and @xmath3 are very close .",
    "then the equivalent inductance @xmath101 would be considerably small .",
    "it is also known that as the number of connected inductive coils increases , the value of @xmath102 would be increasingly lower .",
    "thus it is easy to know that any non - nearest - neighbor coupling between the qubits is negligible .",
    "for simplicity , we will only consider the spin - up charge - qubit array ( and we drop the spin - up label hereafter ) @xmath103 where @xmath33 .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian of a topological superconductor is @xmath104 the ground state of this simple hamiltonian can be found by constructing @xmath105 , which satisfies @xmath106 .",
    "the @xmath107 is defined as @xmath108 . \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now we introduce the representations of the @xmath109 operators to describe the ground states , such as the two eigenstates of @xmath110 : @xmath111 would be @xmath112 .",
    "then the ground state where left ( right ) mbs appears can be written as : @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) .    with regard to local perturbations in the charge - qubit array ,",
    "we need to consider eq.([ham ] ) and some constraints of the parameters , e.g. , @xmath18 and @xmath115 . after some deduction , we know that there are five different types of possible local perturbations in the array : @xmath116 , @xmath117 , @xmath118 , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "it can be seen that each of these perturbations tends to drive the ground state ( @xmath121 or @xmath122 ) to an excited state which has an energy gap @xmath123 above the ground state .",
    "for example , since there are @xmath124 and @xmath125 , we have @xmath126 for @xmath127 , and @xmath128 for @xmath129 and @xmath50 when @xmath116 acts on the ground states .",
    "such state transition is not permitted for a small perturbation like @xmath116 . the same argument can be straightforwardly applied to the other four types of perturbations .",
    "thus , we can see that under the protection of the energy gap , the ground states @xmath121 and @xmath122 where mbss appear are stable to local perturbations .",
    "it has recently been pointed out [ see k. wlms , a. stern , and k. flensberg , phys .",
    "@xmath142 , 246401 ( 2014 ) ] that adiabatic braiding operations with kramers pairs of majorana bound states in class diii superconductor are less protected than in class d systems .      in principle , we want to have the spin - up ( -down ) hard - core boson operators transformed in a similar way as the fermion operators do in eq .",
    "( [ trs ] ) under trs , e.g. , @xmath143 and @xmath144 .",
    "this implies that @xmath145 and @xmath146 exchange their roles under trs , e.g.,@xmath147 and @xmath148 , which , can be implemented by adding an extra @xmath149 flux into the the @xmath34 flux of the spin - down array .        a possible scheme to realize a controllable inductive coupling between two charge qubits ( e.g.,@xmath73 and @xmath74 ) is to use a superconducting circuit containing one inductive coil ( its inductance @xmath153 should be chosen smaller than @xmath3 in order to avoid the fusion of two mbss @xmath56 and @xmath154 ) and several superconducting switches as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the ability of turning on ( off ) the coupling is provided by the superconducting switches which allow switching between insulating and superconducting states in a very short switching time under the control of external field .",
    "we can see that this scheme is fully conducted in a topologically protected way .",
    "it should be also noted that since @xmath153 used is smaller than @xmath3 , the corresponding mutual inductance @xmath155 should be adjusted to ensure that we only need to consider the coupling between the two charge qubits at the ends of arrays ."

    "<S> , it is notable that the analog of the mbss in a charge - qubit system might be spatially extended due to the nonlocality of jordan - wigner transformation . </S>",
    "<S> one may be concerned that this fact could render the charge - qubit system less capable of simulating the operations on the mbss which are strictly localized at the edges of a superconductor system . however , as elaborated in appendix b , we illustrate that the analog of the mbss , although it may not be topologically stable against some local disorders , could be rather stable to local perturbations in the charge - qubit system . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is shown that the charge - qubit system and the superconductor system , which can isomorphically be mapped to each other using jordan - wigner transformation , share the same ground state space . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ trs ] ) , which guarantees the time reversal invariance of this model .    to perform universal single - qubit operations@xcite , we start with a commonly used one , i.e. , the braiding operation . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in a t - shaped charge - qubit junction as shown in fig .  2 , with turning on ( off ) the interqubit coupling @xmath55 in a certain sequence  @xcite , the positions of @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be exchanged , generating a unitary transformation @xmath58  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where @xmath59 are the pauli matrices in the qubit basis . </S>",
    "<S> we further note that the coupling term of two mbss is commutative with the hamiltonian  ( [ ham1 ] ) since the mbss do not enter this hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> thus it is natural to use such kind of coupling  @xcite to generate the unitary transformation of the qubit state . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , @xmath60 can be performed by turning on the coupling @xmath61 for a time span @xmath62 , where @xmath63 . in principle , other transformations such as @xmath64 and @xmath65 can also be achieved by observing that @xmath66 and @xmath67 correspond to @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the qubit basis , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> 3 . </S>",
    "<S> following the same mapping as done before , we come to the basis states of two qubits @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> to realize the cnot gate , it is conventional to first generate the unitary operation @xmath79 by turning on the ising - type coupling @xmath80 which , however , is not applicable in our system . instead , our goal is to generate the unitary transformation @xmath81 which acts on the space spanned by the extended basis @xmath82 where we introduce the pauli matrices @xmath83 to represent the fermion parity space spanned by two ground states of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ham1 ] ) , @xmath84 or @xmath85 , and @xmath86 is the unit matrix . following the same scheme as for single - qubit operations , we have two controllable couplings between qubit a and qubit b ( as shown in fig .  </S>",
