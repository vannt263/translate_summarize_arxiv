    "( see , e.g. , @xcite . the same is not true for the other conic sections , because the similarity class of an ellipse or a hyperbola depends on its eccentricity . ) for that reason , one might expect to find a parabolic analog of the arbelos in the literature of the past two millennia .",
    "however , extensive searches have failed to uncover any mention of one .",
    "this note provides and studies such an analog .    to define it ,",
    "recall first that the latus rectum of a parabola is the focal chord parallel to the directrix ( see section  2 ) .",
    "now , replace the semicircles of the arbelos with the latus rectum arcs of parabolas , all opening in the same direction , whose foci are the centers of the semicircles .",
    "the region bounded by the three arcs is the _ parbelos _ associated to the arbelos .",

    "more intrinsically , given three points @xmath0 on a line , construct parabolas that open in the same direction and have latera recta @xmath1 .",

    "we use theorems of archimedes and lambert to prove seven properties of the parbelos , drawing analogies to similar properties found in the arbelos , some of which may also be new .",
    "the seventh constructs a parbelos directly from an arbelos via a locus . along the way we mention the universal parabolic constant ( an analog of @xmath2 ) , newton s teacher barrow , and an origami fold .",

    "returning to the parbelos , we describe seven properties of it .",
    "the first two are analogous to classical ones of the arbelos , and are based on similarity .",
    "( we paraphrase boas @xcite on the arbelos . )",
    "this is immediate from the knowledge that the length of the latus rectum arc of a parabola is proportional to its semi - latus rectum ; one does not even need to know that the constant of proportionality is the universal parabolic constant  @xmath19 .",
    "[ prop : similar ] under each lower arc of the parbelos , construct a new parbelos similar to the original @xmath20see figure  [ fig : similarparbeloses]@xmath21 .",
    "of the four new lower arcs , the middle two are congruent , and their common length equals one half the harmonic mean of the lengths of the original lower arcs .",
    "denote by @xmath22 and @xmath23 the lengths of the original left and right lower arcs , and by @xmath24 the lengths of the four new lower arcs . by similarity",
    ", we have the equalities @xmath25 as the arcs are latus rectum arcs , the result follows .",
    "the next property of the parbelos is analogous to the fact that _ the area of the arbelos equals @xmath26 times the area of its cusp - midpoints rectangle _ , determined by the middle cusp and the midpoints of the three semicircular arcs ( see figure  [ fig : arbelosrectangle ] ) .",
    "the proof of this fact is similar to that of property  [ prop : parallelogram ] .",
    "[ prop : parallelogram ] the middle cusp of the parbelos and the vertices of its three parabolas determine a parallelogram , the _ cusp - vertices parallelogram_. the area of the parbelos equals @xmath27 times the area of its cusp - vertices parallelogram .",
    "a glance at figure  [ fig : parabola ] reveals that , in figure  [ fig : parallelogram ] , the cusp @xmath10 and the vertices @xmath28 and @xmath29 all lie on a line with slope @xmath30 , as do the cusp @xmath11 and the vertex @xmath31 .",
    "likewise , @xmath32 and @xmath29 all lie on a line with slope @xmath33 , as do @xmath11 and @xmath28 . the first statement follows .",
    "let us denote the area of a parabolic segment by  @xmath34 , and that of a triangle by  @xmath35 .",
    "the area of the parbelos is then @xmath36 and the area of the cusp - vertices parallelogram is @xmath37 by archimedes s calculation of the area of a parabolic segment ( or by integral calculus ) , each  @xmath34 equals 4/3 times the corresponding  @xmath35 .",
    "this proves the second statement .          by figure",
    "[ fig : parabola ] and calculus ( or by the parabola s reflection property ) , the latus rectum of a parabola makes an angle of @xmath38 with the tangent line at each endpoint .",
    "the first statement follows .                  in figure",
    "[ fig : rectangleall ] , choose coordinates @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the endpoints of the diagonal opposite @xmath11 are then @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "now , the equation of the line through @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the equation of the upper parabola , are @xmath47 setting @xmath48 , the only solution is @xmath49 . as @xmath50",
    ", we infer property  [ prop : diagonal ] .",
    "( _ added in proof : _ emmanuel tsukerman @xcite , an undergraduate ( ! ) at stanford university , has solved the problem .",
    "he gives a synthetic proof of property  [ prop : diagonal ] using a converse  which he proves  to lambert s theorem below . )          any three lines tangent to a parabola bound a _ tangent triangle_. by property  [ prop : diagonal ] , a diagonal and two adjacent sides of the tangent rectangle form a tangent triangle of the upper parabola .",
    "property  [ prop : circumcircle ] now follows from _",
    "lambert s theorem _ , which asserts that _ the circumcircle of any tangent triangle of a parabola passes through the focus .",
    "_      see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem  44 ) or @xcite for a proof of lambert s theorem .",
    "( johann heinrich lambert ( 17281777 ) was a swiss mathematician , physicist , and astronomer who gave the first proof that @xmath2  is irrational . )    of course , his theorem can also be applied to tangent triangles of the _ lower _ arcs in the parbelos .",
    "for example , figure  [ fig : twocircumcircles ] shows two similar tangent triangles formed by the tangents at the cusps and a line constructed tangent to both lower parabolas .",
    "the construction requires either solving a cubic equation or doing a beloch origami fold  see hull  @xcite .            using figures  [ fig : arbelosrectangle ] and  [ fig : rectanglecircle ]",
    ", it is easy to show that _ the cusp - midpoints rectangle of the arbelos coincides with the tangent rectangle of the associated parbelos _ , whose foci are the centers of the semicircles of the arbelos .",
    "hence , by property  [ prop : circumcircle ] , _ the circumcircle of the cusp - midpoints rectangle of the arbelos passes through the center of the upper semicircle_see figure  [ fig : arbelosparbelos ] .",
    "we claim that _ the locus of the centers of circles inscribed in any semicircle is the open latus rectum arc of a parabola whose latus rectum is the diameter of the semicircle_. a more general fact was discovered by byer , lazebnik , and smeltzer @xcite .",
    "( _ added in proof : _",
    "tahir @xcite discovered it eleven years earlier . )",
    "we adapt their elegant proof as follows .",
    "let the semicircle have center  @xmath53 , radius  _ _ , and diameter @xmath54 , and let an inscribed circle have center  @xmath55 and radius  _ _ .",
    "drawing a line  @xmath5 parallel to @xmath54 at a distance  @xmath56 as in figure  [ fig : locus ] , we see that @xmath57 hence @xmath55 lies on the parabola with focus @xmath53 and directrix @xmath5 .",
    "since @xmath53 lies on @xmath54 , it is the latus rectum , implying our claim .",
    "finally , applying it to each semicircle of the arbelos leads to property  [ prop : locus ] ."
