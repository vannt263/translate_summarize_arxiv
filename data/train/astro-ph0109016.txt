    "perhaps the best evidence for the existence of dark matter is the flattening of rotation curves of many spiral galaxies .",
    "@xmath7 law for the force of gravity predicts that the observed distribution of baryonic matter should show a fall off in the rotation curves , and hence the need for dark matter to explain the flattening .",
    "a universe predominantly filled with cold dark matter ( cdm ) is consistent with observations of the cosmic microwave background , and the galaxy population .",
    "nevertheless , the dark matter scenario does not readily explain the shape of rotation curves of some galaxies in the inner regions ( e.g. , moore 1994 , flores & primack 1994 , de blok et al .",
    "2001 ) , the dark matter particle has not been discovered , and we lack a direct experimental verification of newton s law of gravity at low accelerations .",
    "so it seems prudent to examine alternative scenarios explaining the flattening of rotation curves .",
    "modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) acting at low accelerations ( e.g. , milgrom 1983 , bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) can explain the flattening of rotation curves without the need for dark matter .",
    "two main versions of mond exist .",
    "the first replaces newton s law of gravity at @xmath8 is often used instead of @xmath9 .",
    "] by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is found to give the best results in fitting the rotation curves .",
    "the second modifies the law of inertia at low accelerations .",
    "here we adopt the first version where the equations of motion can be derived from a lagrangian , admitting conservation of energy and momentum ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) . because of the success of mond at fitting the rotation curves ( e.g. , milgrom & braun 1988 , begeman et al . 1991 , sanders 1996 , de blok & mcgaugh 1998 , sanders & verheijen 1998 ) , it is worthwhile to push it further and confront it with observations of the large scale structure in the universe ( felten 1984 , mcgaugh 1999 , sanders 2001 ) .",
    "a problem here arises however .",
    "mond , when applied to a uniform background , predicts the collapse of any finite region in the universe regardless of the mean density in that region ( e.g. , felten 1984 , sanders 1998 ) . to solve this problem sanders ( 2001 ) proposed a two - field lagrangian based theory of mond in which the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) background cosmology remains intact in the absence of fluctuations .",
    "he argued that this theory leads to large scale structure resembling newtonian dynamics with cdm - like initial conditions .",
    "here we take a simpler approach in which we employ the jeans swindle to write a mond type relationship between the fluctuations in the density and the gravitational force field .",
    "although our procedure can be derived from a lagrangian and is equivalent to sanders two - field theory in the limit of small coupling , we do not see any physical justification for it .",
    "nevertheless , the equations of motion have the desired properties and we proceed to explore their consequences on the evolution of large scale structure .",
    "the background frw cosmology is described by the scale factor @xmath12 normalized to unity at the present , the hubble function @xmath13 , and the total mean background density @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the mean matter density and @xmath16 is the cosmological constant .",
    "further , we define @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the critical density .",
    "these cosmological quantities are related by einstein equations of general relativity .",
    "let @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote , respectively , physical and comoving coordinates .",
    "the fluctuations over the uniform background in the matter distributions are described by the the comoving peculiar velocity @xmath21 of a patch of matter , the density contrast @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the local density , and the fluctuations in the gravitational force field , @xmath0 . neglecting thermal effects ,",
    "the newtonian equations of motion governing the evolution of the fluctuations are : the continuity equation @xmath24 the euler equation of motion , @xmath25 and the poisson equation , @xmath26 in the linear regime these equations imply that @xmath27 decreases with time ( see 3.1 ) .",
    "once @xmath28 drops below @xmath9 , mond takes over the subsequent evolution of the fluctuations . the continuity equation ( [ cont ] )",
    "reflects mass conservations and holds also in mond .",
    "the mondification ( terminology by m. milgrom ) must be done by either changing the law of inertia , i.e. , the euler equation ( [ euler ] ) , or the relation between the density and the force field , i.e. , the poisson equation ( [ poisson ] ) . here",
    "we choose to maintain the euler equation and replace the poisson equation with @xmath29 in writing this equation we have assumed that mond only affects the fluctuations and leaves the background cosmology intact .",
    "this `` jeans swindle '' ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) is hard to justify on physical grounds , even though it leads to equations of motion which can be derived from a lagrangian , admitting conservation of energy and momentum ( sanders 2001 , bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) .",
    "although we can take @xmath9 to be a function of time here we assume it is a constant and write it as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a numerical fudge factor , @xmath32 is the speed of light , @xmath33 is the current value of the hubble function , and @xmath34 is the hubble radius .",
    "fitting the rotation curves by mond requires @xmath35 for @xmath36 ( e.g. sanders 1996 ) , but we will see that @xmath37 must be smaller for mond to be in reasonable agreement with the observed large scale structure .",
    "equation ( [ mondpoisson ] ) determines @xmath0 only up to a divergence free vector field @xmath38 .",
    "so in a sense the theory is incomplete .",
    "however , bekenstein & milgrom ( 1984 ) have shown that @xmath38 decays rapidly with increasing scale .",
    "so on large scales we neglect @xmath38 and assume that @xmath39 is irrotational so that it is fully determined by ( [ mondpoisson ] ) . for conciseness",
    "we gather all the time dependent function in the euler equation .",
    "so let us define an irrotational vector field @xmath40 satisfying @xmath41 then , by ( [ mondpoisson ] ) , we have @xmath42 so the euler equation becomes @xmath43 the newtonian equivalent of this equation is @xmath44",
    "we treat now the mond equations in the limit of small density fluctuations .",
    "we focus on the evolution at early times when @xmath45 , restricting the treatment to a matter dominated universe . assuming that the fluctuations are initially newtonian , we discuss the epoch at which they become mond dominated , and the shape of their power - spectrum in the mond regime .",
    "the modified poisson equation ( [ mondpoisson ] ) relating @xmath46 and @xmath47 is non - linear and can not be linearized .",
    "however , we can write the equations at early times when @xmath48 and@xmath49 are still @xmath50 . in this limit",
    "we neglect the term @xmath51 in the continuity equation ( [ cont ] ) and replace the full derivative @xmath52 with @xmath53 in the euler equation ( [ eulerscaled ] ) .",
    "the continuity equation then implies that @xmath54 which in combination with equation ( [ sfreep ] ) gives @xmath55 substituting this result in the euler equation ( [ eulerscaled ] ) and neglecting @xmath56 in @xmath57 yield @xmath58 this system of 3 first order differential equations determines @xmath59 locally at any point in space .",
    "the full solution depends on the values of @xmath60 and its time derivative at some initial time , @xmath61 .",
    "we could not find analytic solutions to this equation , but in an @xmath62 universe the asymptotic behavior @xmath63 can easily be obtained by substituting @xmath64 .",
    "this gives @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the hubble time . using ( [ gntog ] ) , this implies @xmath67 so @xmath1 approaches a constant that is smaller than @xmath9 , i.e. , fluctuations entering mond never become newtonian again .",
    "integration of the mond equations for the spherical collapse model ( not shown here ) , and the n - body simulations presented in section 4 show that @xmath68 also in the moderately non - linear regime . in fig .",
    "[ glin ] we plot @xmath69 as a function of @xmath70 , in the limit of small density fluctuations in an @xmath62 universe",
    ". the solid line follows the growing mode of linear newtonian theory .",
    "the dotted line shows @xmath1 in the mond regime and is obtained by numerical integration of ( [ lineargn ] ) for @xmath68 .",
    "this numerical solution confirms our analytic result that @xmath1 approaches @xmath71 .",
    "this asymptotic behavior has interesting implications on the topology of the density field .",
    "it implies that one - dimensional pancake - like perturbations the density contrast @xmath72 vanishes in all space except at the surfaces of @xmath73 , where it can be described by a dirac - delta function . in a generic three - dimensional perturbation ,",
    "surfaces of @xmath73 are still singular but the density contrast in the rest of space is non - vanishing and grows with time like @xmath74 as compared to @xmath75 for the growing mode in linear newtonian theory ( e.g. peebles 1980 ) . we will use this result in 3.2 to estimate the shape of the power - spectrum in early time mond .",
    "the fluctuations in the newtonian gravitational force field over a spherical region of physical radius @xmath76 and density contrast @xmath47 are @xmath77 , where @xmath78 .",
    "since @xmath79 , @xmath80 decreases with time if @xmath81 with @xmath82 . in linear",
    "newtonian theory , @xmath83 and so at early enough times @xmath84 and the fluctuations would be in the newtonian regime . at later times",
    "@xmath80 drops below @xmath9 and the fluctuations enter the mond regime .",
    "here we determine the redshift at which fluctuations on a comoving scale @xmath85 become mond dominated .",
    "assume that the transition epoch between newtonian dynamics and mond occurs early enough so that @xmath45 , an assumption that will be justified below .",
    "the initial density field in the newtonian regime is gaussian and characterized by the power - spectrum , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the fourier transform of the density as a function of the wavenumber , @xmath88 . if the power - spectrum is a power - law of index @xmath89 , then the @xmath90 value of the density field smoothed on a comoving scale @xmath85 at redshift @xmath91 is approximately @xmath92 where the redshift dependence through @xmath93 follows from linear newtonian theory if @xmath62 , and the scale @xmath94 sets the amplitude of the fluctuations . according to either ( [ poisson ] ) or @xmath95 , the @xmath90 of @xmath80 on a scale @xmath85 is @xmath96 the redshift , @xmath97 , at which @xmath98 is then @xmath99 so if @xmath3 then fluctuations on small scales enter the mond regime before large scale fluctuations . for @xmath100",
    "the interpretation that large scales become mond dominated earlier is somewhat vague .",
    "it is hard to visualize a large scale fluctuation in the mond regime while the superimposed small scale fluctuations are still newtonian .",
    "a more appropriate interpretation is that for @xmath100 the volume of space containing fluctuations in the mond regime is mainly made up of large regions separated by small scale fluctuations that are still newtonian .",
    "this interpretation is sustained by the following argument . since in the newtonian regime @xmath0",
    "is gaussian , the probability that a spherical region of radius @xmath85 becomes mond dominated at time @xmath101 is , @xmath102 according to ( [ sigmag ] ) , @xmath103 so if @xmath100 then @xmath104 increases with scale , meaning that the fraction of space already in mond is made up of large regions . if @xmath3 then @xmath104 decreases with scale and mond penetrates small regions before it dominates the whole space .",
    "fluctuations enter the mond regime at a relatively early time .",
    "taking @xmath105 and @xmath106 then , according to ( [ mondtrans ] ) , the transition into mond occurs at @xmath107 , on scales @xmath108 if @xmath100 , and @xmath109 if @xmath3 . in a cdm - like power - spectrum the effective power - index on scales @xmath110 is @xmath111 and changes to @xmath112 on smaller scales . for this type of power - spectrum",
    "the transition into mond of all scales occurs at an early time when the density fluctuations are still small and @xmath45 .",
    "this considerably simplifies our task of estimating the density power - spectrum in the mond regime in the next subsection .",
    "mond gives accelerations @xmath113 , leading to faster growth rates than newtonian gravity .",
    "so we expect a break in the shape of the power - spectrum at the scale just entering mond . assuming a power - law power - spectrum , @xmath114 , in the newtonian regime we estimate the power - index of the density fluctuations after they become mond dominated .",
    "consider the @xmath90 value , @xmath115 , of the density field over any scale @xmath85 .",
    "suppose that at redshift @xmath116 fluctuations on all scales were newtonian so that @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is given by ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "let @xmath119 be the scale just entering the mond regime at redshift @xmath120 . for simplicity",
    "we consider the case @xmath3 , so at @xmath121 the evolution is newtonian and @xmath122 . a fluctuation on a scale @xmath123 entered mond at redshift @xmath124 .",
    "as we have seen in the previous subsection fluctuations on a wide range of scales become mond dominated at an early enough time so that @xmath45 . in an @xmath45 universe , the growth factors in the newtonian and mond regimes are @xmath75 and @xmath125 , respectively .",
    "so , from @xmath126 until @xmath127 the fluctuation grew by a factor of @xmath128 , while from @xmath127 until @xmath91 it grew by @xmath129 , where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 .",
    "so for @xmath133 , @xmath134 according to ( [ mondtrans ] ) @xmath135 and @xmath136 so the power - index in the mond regime is @xmath137 .",
    "a similar argument for @xmath138 yields the same result .",
    "therefore the power - index in the mond regime is independent of the value of @xmath139 .",
    "a general power - spectrum can be approximated as a power - law over any limited range of scales where our result applies .",
    "therefore , mond drives the power - spectrum towards @xmath4 independent of its shape in the newtonian regime .",
    "the treatment here ignored mode - coupling and assumed that all fluctuations became mond dominated when @xmath140 was still very close to unity .",
    "although the simulations presented in the next section do not show strong mode - coupling for low values of @xmath9 , the shape of the power - spectrum derived here should serve as a general indication only .",
    "in this section we study the general evolution of fluctuations under mond by means of n - body simulations .",
    "this is done by adapting a particle - mesh ( pm ) n - body code originally written by e. bertschinger to solve the newtonian equations ( bertschinger & gelb 1991 ) . at each time step",

    "the correlation between the fields is tight for both @xmath152 ( simulation iv ) and @xmath171 ( v ) .",
    "the scatter between the fields is larger than in the newtonian simulation ( vi ) , but it is negligible compared to observational uncertainties . the slope of the regression of @xmath172 on @xmath173 is higher in simulation @xmath174 than in the newtonian simulation , @xmath175 .",
    "these two simulations have @xmath152 but as is the case with rotational speeds of galaxies , mond also accounts for larger velocities on large scales .",

    "we have run a suite of simulations with this recipe for modeling the transition into mond .",

    "several arguments against mond have been presented in the literature ( e.g. , felten 1984 , van den bosch et al . 2000 , mortlock & turner 2001 , aguirre et al . 2001 , scott et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the reader may decide for her / himself which of these arguments are compelling .",
    "here we focus on examining the general properties of large scale structure under mond and put aside the arguments presented in the literature against mond .",
    "the value of @xmath9 necessary to fit the rotation curves of galaxies produces far too much clustering and can be consistent with observations only with strong anti - bias .",
    "decreasing @xmath9 has two effects : 1 ) it pushes the epoch of mond domination to later time , and 2 ) it reduces the typical accelerations produced by mond forces .",
    "the simulations presented in this paper show that mond with smaller @xmath9 leads to large scale structure similar to newtonian dynamics .",
    "this is encouraging for mond since the standard paradigm based on newtonian gravity and dark matter is successful at explaining many observations of the large scale structure and the galaxy population ( e.g. , kauffman , nusser & steinmetz 1997 , benson et al . 2000 , diaferio et al .",
    "still one has to adopt a generalization of mond , allowing for , or at least mimicking , a scale dependent @xmath9 .",
    "sanders ( 2001 ) two - field theory for example can serve as a general framework for that purpose . in this theory the rapid growth of fluctuations in mond",
    "is tamed by the coupling between the two fields .",
    "the amplitude of the initial conditions used in the simulations roughly matches the normalization implied by measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies ( hu w. , sugiyama & silk 1997 ) .",
    "we have seen that by reducing the amplitude of the initial conditions by a large factor mond with the standard value of @xmath9 produces the correct @xmath144 , but causes a severe washing out of structure on scale of 10s of @xmath186 .",
    "therefore it seems necessary to decrease @xmath9 to match the large scale structure .",
    "our goal here was to present general criteria for the consistency of mond with large scale structure .",
    "further study of mond within a realsitic recipe for galaxy formation to clarify the role of ( anti- ) biasing remains to be done .",

    "<S> newtonian theory , @xmath1 decreases with time and eventually becomes @xmath2 , the threshold below which mond is dominant . </S>",
    "<S> if the newtonian initial density field has a power - law power - spectrum of index @xmath3 , then mond domination proceeds from small to large scale . at early times mond tends to drive the density power - spectrum towards @xmath4 , independent of its shape in the newtonian regime . </S>",
    "<S> we use n - body simulations to solve the mond equations of motion starting from initial conditions with a cdm power - spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> mond with the standard value @xmath5 , yields a high clustering amplitude that can match the observed galaxy distribution only with strong ( anti- ) biasing . </S>",
    "<S> a value of @xmath6 , however , gives results similar to newtonian dynamics and can be consistent with the observed large scale structure .    </S>",
