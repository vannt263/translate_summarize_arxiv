    "resurgent analysis is a method of studying hyperasymptotic expansions @xmath0 and those of similar kind by treating such expansions as asymptotics obtained from a laplace integral @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a ramified analytic function in the complex domain with a discrete set of singularities and @xmath3 is an infinite path on the riemann surface of @xmath2 .",
    "the crucial observation is that the terms of ( [ hyperasexpn ] ) can be recovered from studying the singularities of @xmath2 , see  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite , as well as  @xcite for this author s preferred terminology .",
    "the methods of resurgent analysis have been used , in particular , to study asymptotics of solutions of linear ode with a small parameter , especially the schrdinger equation in the semiclassical approximation , see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these applications justify the need to give a fully rigorous and detailed treatment of foundations of resurgent analysis , and the present work is a step in this direction .",
    "probably the most important of these foundational questions is the existence of resurgent solutions of a schrdinger equation .",
    "more specifically , consider an equation of the type @xmath4 where @xmath5 ranges over @xmath6 , @xmath7 is a small complex asymptotic parameter , and @xmath8 is an entire function often assumed to be a polynomial .",
    "the transformation ( [ laplacetransf ] ) brings this equation to the form @xmath9 which needs to be satisfied modulo functions that are entire with respect to @xmath10 for every values of @xmath5 for some ramified analytic function @xmath2 . since the beginnings of resurgent analysis in the early 1980s",
    "there has been no real doubt that ( [ mainequ ] ) possesses two linearly independent ( in an appropriate sense ) solutions that are endlessly analytically continuable with respect to @xmath10 and satisfy certain growth conditions at infinity .",
    "the manifold on which @xmath11 is defined is usually quite complicated . in the special cases when",
    "@xmath12 and @xmath13 , the function @xmath11 can be written down by an explicit formula and @xmath14 is expressible in terms of airy or weber function , see @xcite . for more complicated potentials ,",
    "say , when @xmath8 is a polynomial of degree @xmath15 , the function @xmath11 is expected to be defined on a highly transcendental manifold , see @xcite and @xcite . in particular , if for a fixed @xmath5 one projects",
    "_ all _ singularities on _ all _ sheets of the riemann surface @xmath11 to the complex plane of @xmath10 , one expects to obtain an everywhere dense set .",
    "thus , there is no hope that the manifold in question is a universal cover of @xmath16 minus a discrete family of complex curves .",
    "this article arises from the author s attempt to understand the treatment of the equation given in the book  @xcite , which we will recall in the next section . in this book ,",
    "the solution @xmath2 is represented as a sum of an infinite von neumann series and it is claimed that 1 ) all term of the von neumann series are defined on the same endlessly continuable riemann surface ( actually , a complex two - dimensional manifold ) , and 2 ) the series converges .",
    "we do not quite understand the convergence proof for reasons mentioned in the next section and hope that an alternative treatment emerges in the near future . here",
    "we will explicitly construct a part of the riemann surface in question .    here is the main philosophical point of this article . in the literature on resurgent analysis the function @xmath11 is defined for every fixed @xmath5 on a riemann surface with a priori infinitely many sheets with no artificial boundaries , and this gives the theory much of its elegance and aesthetic appeal .",
    "for example ,  @xcite derives asymptotic connection formulae by considering how singularities of @xmath2 are expected to behave on the first as well as on the second sheet of the riemann surface .",
    "however , that is no longer available on the web ] if we are only interested in asymptotics of solutions of ( [ schroeeq ] ) in the form ( [ hyperasexpn ] ) , it is enough to construct @xmath2 on the whole of the first sheet and analytically continue it just a little bit beyond the cuts .",
    "shatalov - sternin s method allows us to do just that ( see below for a precise statement ) ; we need to make no reference to the further sheets of the riemann surface .",
    "let us briefly recall ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite for details ) that the hyperasymptotic expansion of @xmath14 for @xmath17 is obtained as follows .",
    "fix @xmath5 and draw an infinite integration path @xmath3 in the complex plane of @xmath10 to the left of the singularities @xmath18 of @xmath11 , fig.[paper3p3],left , so that , at least morally , @xmath19 . using analyticity of @xmath11 and under appropriate conditions on its growth at infinity one can push the integration contour @xmath3 to the right and rewrite @xmath20 where infinite integration paths @xmath21  hang \" on the singularities @xmath22 , fig.[paper3p3],middle .",
    "finally , one deforms each @xmath21 so that both infinite branches lie on different sheets of the riemann surface right on top of each other , rewrites @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the jump of @xmath2 across the cut starting at @xmath22 and the integral is taken along a semi - infinite real analytic path similar to those on fig.[paper3p3],right .",
    "asymptotic expansions of this type can now be calculated using watson s lemma and combined to a hyperasymptotic expansion .",
    "we would like to reiterate that we have used existence of the analytic continuation of @xmath11 just a little bit beyond the cuts starting from its first - sheet singularities .    ]    trying to understand  @xcite s construction of the riemann surface , we took a case of a potential @xmath8 roughly corresponding to an anharmonic oscillator , with two turning points @xmath25 .",
    "we used the conclusions of the heuristic argument in  @xcite to describe an open complex 2-dimensional manifold @xmath26 , on which one expects the solution @xmath11 to be defined . in  @xcite s proof @xmath2",
    "is expressed via a sum of a von neumann series ( [ vnseries ] ) of iterations of integral operators @xmath27 , @xmath28 applied to some initial function .",
    "we covered @xmath26 by open subsets and constructed an analytic continuation of the summands of the von neumann series to each one of those , which led to consideration of some two hundred separate cases .",
    "then we classified the arguments that we have been using and stated them as lemmas [ trivialreason]-[case10 ] .",
    "thus the proof of the existence of the analytic continuation of @xmath2 to all points in @xmath26 has become a list of references to these lemmas with a few additional comments .",
    "the argument presented in this paper remains too combinatorial for the author s taste .",
    "however , we believe that a similar statement for more complicated potentials can be proven in essentially the same way using lemmas [ trivialreason]-[case10 ] . thus , although we do not give a proof of the general case , we offer a method that should in principle work for an arbitrary entire potential @xmath8 .",
    "specializing the exposition of  @xcite , let us consider the one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath29\\varphi(h , x ) = 0 , \\label{schroeeq1}\\ ] ] where the variable @xmath5 takes values in @xmath6 and @xmath8 is an entire function .",
    "we will be solving the laplace - transformed equation @xmath30 modulo functions that are entire with respect to @xmath10 for every values of @xmath5 , and we will be looking for its solution @xmath2 in the class of ramified analytic function , i.e. an analytic function on some complex two - dimensional manifold projecting to @xmath16 with coordinates @xmath31 .    the cauchy - kowalewskaya theorem , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th.3.1.1 ) , for this equation falls far short of the statement that we need .",
    "indeed , for the equation with an initial condition @xmath32 ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) one would only get existence of solution @xmath11 in a small polydisc centered at @xmath34 for @xmath35 , and the size of that polydisc is hard to control .",
    "therefore a more explicit construction of @xmath2 is proposed .",
    "fix a point @xmath36 such that @xmath37 and a determination @xmath38 of @xmath39 in a neighborhood of @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath40 ; let further @xmath41 and @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "we will use the following two operations on the classes of ramified analytic functions modulo functions entire with respect to @xmath10 : @xmath44 @xmath45    define the operator @xmath46 acting on ( germs of ) ramified analytic functions @xmath47 by the formula @xmath48 where @xmath49 stands for the derivative of the function with respect to the first argument . in",

    "the first task is to construct a `` riemann surface ''  a two dimensional complex manifold on which all terms of the infinite series in the expression of @xmath72 are defined .",
    "it is easy to see that an equivalent question is to construct a `` riemann surface '' on which all functions @xmath73 are defined .",
