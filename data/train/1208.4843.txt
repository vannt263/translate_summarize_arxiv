    "the rate of accretion events and mergers is a fundamental quantity that hierarchical growth models must be able to predict accurately .",
    "a proper comparison to an empirical rate measurement is elusive ( see * ? ? ? * for a description of the current state of the field ) .",

    "* ) and results often disagree among studies @xcite .",
    "these measurements are difficult , even with the superb angular resolution of the _ hubble space telescope _ , for high redshift galaxies .",
    "however , renewed focus on identifying tidal features at low redshift has yielded some striking successes both in the increased incidence of detected features @xcite and their scale and morphologies @xcite .",
    "we aim to make a measurement of the major merger rate at low redshift , but as a function of environment .",
    "a complication in practice is that the definition of a major , vs a minor , merger is typically made on the basis of the mass ratio between the two galaxies .",
    "such a definition is difficult to apply empirically , particularly in environments that may have affected the individual galaxies and in cases where the two initial galaxies have merged into a single remnant .",
    "we define a major merger here as one that results in the large - scale tidal features we are searching for around luminous , early - type ( @xmath5 profile ) galaxies .",
    "although this approach evidently complicates comparisons to models , it should not impact our primary goal of searching for patterns in the occurrence of tidal features as a function of environment .",
    "@xcite showed how the dark matter halo structure of the merging galaxies can significantly alter the appearance of a major merger , thereby demonstrating that measurements of major merger signatures , even at a single redshift , could be a sensitive model diagnostic . beyond the purpose of understanding hierarchical accretion",
    "better , we need to study the merger rate in clusters and in the surrounding environments because these events contribute stars to the ubiquitous intracluster stellar population @xcite , which is an important component in estimates of the baryon budget of groups and clusters @xcite , and calculations of the chemical enrichment history of the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "furthermore , extending any study of galaxies within clusters out to the surrounding environs is critical because differences in their star formation histories , which could be related to interactions , begin to appear at clustercentric radii of several mpc @xcite .",
    "the principal observational challenge in identifying tidal features is that such features are of low surface brightness and have irregular morphologies .",
    "a variety of techniques have been developed to identify merging galaxies and mergers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the problem takes on different forms depending on the redshift of the galaxies and the depth and uniformity , or  flatness \" , of the data . for galaxies in the local universe ,",
    "@xcite employed unsharp masking ( subtracting a smoothed image of the galaxy from itself ) , galaxy model division ( dividing the galaxy image by a best - fit model galaxy made from nested elliptical isophotes ) , and color mapping ( division of the galaxy image in one color band by the galaxy image in another color band ) to aid in the visual detection of tidal features and found that 41% ( 9 of 22 ) of analyzed isolated galaxies show tidal features , while only 8% ( 1 of 12 ) of group galaxies had such features .",
    "while this result is certainly suggestive of lower rates of tidal features in group environments than in the field , poisson statistics limits the significance of the discrepancy to less than @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite divided his galaxy images by a model fit and measured the mean absolute deviation of the residuals to define a quantitative threshold for the identification of tidally disturbed galaxies .",
    "he found that 53% of his sample of 126 red , field galaxies show tidal features , while 71% of the bulge - dominated early - type subset of 86 galaxies appear to be tidally disturbed . using a similar method for a sample of nearby , luminous , elliptical galaxies ,",
    "@xcite found that 50% ( 5 of 10 ) of cluster galaxies , 62% ( 13 of 18 ) of poor - group galaxies , and 76% ( 16 of 21 ) of isolated galaxies have tidal features .",

    "visual examination did not reveal any cases where tidal features began beyond the analyzed image region .",
    "though there are a few cases where large tidal features continue beyond the analyzed image region , these galaxies are still correctly identified as tidally - disturbed by both the visual and automated selections .      in studies of mergers and merger remnants",

    "automated approaches are repeatable and well - defined , the latter being particularly important for comparisons to models , but are likely to be less powerful in selecting varying morphologies within this ill - defined class of objects .",
    "we resolve this conflict by applying both approaches .    to objectively determine whether a galaxy is tidally - disturbed we follow the general procedure presented by @xcite ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - flowchart ] ) to calculate a tidal parameter from the average residual of the galaxy image divided by its best fit model .",
    "first a background gradient is fit and subtracted from each galaxy image using the background generated by sextractor with back@xmath24size = 64 and back@xmath24filtersize = 3 , in order to minimize large scale gradients across the galaxy images caused by intracluster light or nearby bright galaxies .",
    "the background map generated by sextractor is a bicubic spline interpolation over the sigma - clipped pixels in the area of the back@xmath24size parameter median - filtered over the back@xmath24filtersize number of back@xmath24size areas .",
    "the back@xmath24size parameter is chosen for our pixel scale ( 0.187\" / pixel ) to be larger than the scales of typical tidal features .",
    "the tidal parameter analysis is very sensitive to unmasked sources , which are easily confused with tidal matter .",
    "pixels with known objects are masked using the sextractor object catalog . to optimize masking of background sources",
    "while minimizing masking of real tidal features , we create our masks from the union of two different masking catalogs .",
    "one catalog targets large galaxies using detectmin@xmath24area @xmath37 5 , detect@xmath24thresh @xmath37 1.8 , and deblend@xmath24mincont @xmath37 0.001 to only mask very significant sources well removed from the subject galaxy .",
    "these parameters require detectmin@xmath24area number of neighboring pixels to be detect@xmath24thresh sigma above the background in order to be detected as an object .",
    "the deblend@xmath24mincont parameter determines if a cluster of pixels above the detection threshold should be divided into multiple sources , and has been tuned here to differentiate only very distinct clumps as separate objects .",
    "a second , more aggressive catalog targeting stars is generated by only identifying objects with class@xmath38star less than 0.05 with detect@xmath24thresh @xmath37 1.4 , and deblend@xmath24mincont @xmath37 0.0001 ( a lower deblending contrast to more readily identify stars blended with the target galaxy ) .",
    "we also create a background sky frame to be used in a noise correction term ( described below ) using a third , very agressive catalog generated with detect@xmath24thresh @xmath37 0.8 , and deblend@xmath24mincont @xmath37 0.001 that masks all sources ( including the target galaxy and associated tidal features ) .",
    "unmasked pixels are randomly chosen to replace the masked pixels in the creation of a background image in order to preserve the noise characteristics of the original image .",
    "we create a best - fit model for each galaxy using the iraf tasks _ ellipse _ and _ bmodel_. we fix the isophotal center but allow for variable position angle and ellipticity as a function of semi - major axis to generate best - fit isophotes out to 80% of the postage stamp image dimensions , and then create the corresponding model galaxy .",
    "the model image covers the entire postage stamp area , with pixel values set to zero beyond the area covered by the best fit model .",
    "pixels whose model value exceeds 0.01 times the peak value at the galaxy center are masked so that the analysis focuses on any extended tidal features rather than residuals near the galaxy nucleus that may arise from slight misplacement of the galaxy center in the model .",
    "the masked galaxy image is then divided by the model image .",
    "the residual image is median filtered with a 5@xmath365 pixel kernel in order to facilitate visual identification of tidal features .",
    "we further supplement our pixel mask by running sextractor on the smoothed residual image with detectmin@xmath24area @xmath37 5 , detect@xmath24thresh @xmath37 5 , and deblend@xmath24mincont @xmath37 0.0001 primarily in order to mask faint galaxies close to the primary galaxy .",
    "the final mask for a typical galaxy includes 5 - 20% of the pixels in the area over which the model is computed .",
    "we discard all galaxies that have over 50% of the image area masked .",
    "this should not bias the results unless real tidal features are being masked ( which we visually verified is very uncommon , with only a few cases out of several thousand galaxies ) .",
    "we also confirm with a control sample that the masking is not responsible for the radial trend we discuss below ( see  3.2 ) . with the enhanced mask we repeat the process of creating a model galaxy and smoothed residual image .",
    "we examine all galaxy and residual images for quality and calculate the tidal parameter .",
    "we visually inspect and discard the galaxy and corresponding residual images that are contaminated with unmasked diffraction spikes from bright stars .",
    "we also flag galaxies that have visible tidal structure .",

    "the correspondence is not perfect , as we describe further below , but we settle on defining those galaxies with @xmath42 as tidally - disturbed .",

    "as we mention in  2.2 a tight color selection could result in a bias if interacting galaxies are bluer than the mean .",
    "the mean color offset from the red sequence is @xmath54 for the visually - selected sample and @xmath55 for the cleaned - auto sample , while the mean color offset for all galaxies analyzed is @xmath56 , demonstrating that our interacting samples do not suffer from a color bias .",
    "the rate of tidally disturbed cluster galaxies we find is significantly lower than the rate observed by @xcite , but the difference is likely because our sample is @xmath1 an order of magnitude more distant , resulting in the smaller apparent size of galaxies and their associated tidal features .",
    "our rates match more closely those of @xcite and @xcite , although again it is complicated to compare results among studies .",
    "although the measured rate of tidal features appears small at first , some minor adjustments can lead to an inference that the majority of the initial cluster elliptical population must have experienced a major merger .",
    "first , the @xmath1 3% rate , implies that at least 6% of the initial population experienced a merger because a merger involves two galaxies . if one then considers that the tidal signatures will not last indefinitely the numbers rise again .",
    "if , for example , tidal features last 2 gyr @xcite then the rate of mergers increases by a factor of about 5 to @xmath57 . if one further considers that mergers were probably more likely in the past , then the number rises even more .",
    "none of this is empirically well determined , but our fundamental conclusion is that our low rate measurement does not necessarily imply a low incidence of mergers over the lifetime of these galaxies .      before proceeding to examine the spatial distribution of galaxies with tidal features , we stop to consider the effect of interloping galaxies on our radial trends . without spectroscopic redshifts , we do not know with certainty whether or not a particular galaxy is in the cluster .",
    "this acts to muddle any real correlations with radius . to estimate the effect of interlopers within our color - selected samples , we count the number of galaxies selected using color - magnitude bands of the same size displaced redward by 0.26 mag ( the thickness of our selection area ) .",
    "these displaced color - magnitude bands contain 2834 galaxies , while the bands centered on the red sequences contain 11,904 galaxies , suggesting that approximately 80% of our selected galaxies are cluster members .",
    "we also count the number of galaxies in the four deep fields of the cfhtls @xcite that would satisfy our galaxy selection criteria .",
    "the count from the cfhtls - deep fields yielded a much lower estimation of the number of interloping galaxies , but had large field - to - field variation .",
    "therefore , we conservatively use the interloper estimate from the displaced color - magnitude bands and repeat our tidal parameter analysis for these redder galaxies to determine what effect they may have on the results",
    ". a higher fraction of the background galaxies are ellipticals , because we are dealing with brighter and redder galaxies , resulting in a slightly higher fraction of these ( 34% versus 30% of the cluster sample ) meeting all selection criteria and contributing to the final results .",
    "as expected for a background population , the fraction of interlopers that are tidally disturbed does not correlate with clustercentric radius  demonstrating that crowding toward the center of the cluster does not artificially create a radial effect .",
    "however , interlopers are a larger fraction of our  cluster \" sample at larger clustercentric radii ( as high as 45% beyond @xmath58 vs less than 10% within @xmath58 ) due to the steep decrease in the number density of actual cluster galaxies at larger clustercentric radii .",
    "the background galaxies have slightly higher rates of tidal features ( @xmath59 visually - detected and @xmath60 auto - detected , with the statistical uncertainties calculated using the poisson single - sided limits from @xcite ) than the cluster sample ( @xmath61 visually - detected and @xmath62 auto- detected ) suggesting that they might slightly influence any radial behavior .      to examine the rates of tidal features as a function of projected clustercentric radius , we rescale the projected radii using the @xmath58 value of each cluster from @xcite .",
    "these radii were estimated using the conversion between @xmath63 and @xmath64 found by @xcite and the correspondence between @xmath64 and @xmath58 .",
    "clustercentric radii are measured from the brightest cluster galaxy ( though we verified that the results do not change significantly when the radii are measured from the x - ray center ) .",
    "not all clusters are sampled to the same normalized projected clustercentric radius , so we consider different subsamples .",
    "we create a first subsample of the 1657 galaxies within @xmath58 in the 50 clusters for which our survey is complete out to @xmath58 , a second subsample of the 1540 galaxies within @xmath65 in the 26 clusters for which we are complete to @xmath65 , and a combined sample of all galaxies within @xmath58 in clusters complete to @xmath58 and all galaxies within @xmath65 in clusters complete to @xmath65 . in figure [ fig - histograms ]",
    "we plot the relative radial distributions of  all \" galaxies and our various samples of galaxies with tidal signatures .",
    "the distributions shown in figure [ fig - histograms ] make clear that there is a significant deficit of galaxies with tidal signatures towards the centers of these clusters .",
    "the deficit is evident within @xmath4 , which is well outside an area about the brightest central galaxy where one might expect that confusion could lead to lower detection rates . in fact , as we find with a control sample of background galaxies that shows no gradient in tidal features , we are not affected by confusion in the center of these clusters (  3.2 ) . finally , these findings are independent of whether visual or automated techniques are utilized .",
    "to place these conclusions on a more solid statistical footing , we apply k - s tests to evaluate the likelihood that the cumulative distributions of galaxies with tidal features are drawn from the parent distribution of  all \" galaxies . for the sample complete within @xmath58",
    "we find that the tidal sample was not drawn from the parent sample with 98.2% confidence for the visually - selected sample , 91.5% confidence for the automated selection , 94.5% for the intersection of the two samples , and 97.4% for the union .",
    "for the sample complete to @xmath65 , the confidence limits fall below @xmath6 significance .",
    "the radial variations in the incidence of tidal signatures suggests that either ( or both ) the creation or destruction of tidal features depends on clustercentric radius . more appropriately , the variation depends on a physical characteristic that drives the phenomenon and which is itself correlated with clustercentric radius .",
    "a straightforward hypothesis is that tidal signatures are more easily erased in a dense environment due to shorter dynamical times .",
    "while this is likely to be true near the center of the clusters , where the intracluster light is built up , by the time one is considering galaxies at @xmath58 and beyond , it may seem unlikely that the global potential will strip tidal material .    to test this hypothesis",
    ", we rely on numerical simulations by @xcite that find that the decay time of tidal streams is approximately 1.5 times the dynamical time at their location in the cluster .",
    "the dynamical time at clustercentric radius @xmath66 is given by , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the mass enclosed within @xmath66 .",
    "we therefore set the lifetime of tidal features , @xmath69 , to be @xmath70 .",
    "we determine the enclosed mass using the nfw density profile @xcite : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and we take @xmath73 to be an appropriate concentration parameter for the distribution of galaxies in clusters @xcite . if the fraction of galaxies to form tidal features , @xmath74 , is uniform with clustercentric radius and time , then the expected fraction of galaxies observed to have such features would be : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the age of the universe .",
    "the observed fraction as a function of projected clustercentric radius is then given by calculating the average fraction along the line of sight : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the number density of our  all \" sample . because the nfw profile is not a good description of the mass or galaxy number density to arbitrarily large radius",
    ", we replace the integration limit with @xmath80 . using this prescription and assuming that galaxies trace mass , we find that the distribution of galaxies predicted as a function of projected radius by the nfw profile roughly reproduces our observed distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - distro ] ) .",
    "we now compare our results to the expected distribution of observed tidal features if the lifetime of the features is proportional to the local dynamical time and the generation of tidal features is independent of time or clustercentric radius ( see fig . [ fig - cd_radius_model ] ) .",
    "while the cumulative distribution of tidally - disturbed galaxies still lies below the model prediction within @xmath58 , the deviation is still only statistically significant for the visually - selected sample of disturbed galaxies . for",
    "the sample complete within @xmath58 , the k - s test shows that the visually - selected sample is drawn from a different distribution than the  all \" sample with 95.8% confidence , the automated selection differs with 81.3% confidence , the intersection of the two samples is discrepant at 91.0% confidence , and the union is discrepant at 91.7% . for the sample complete to @xmath65",
    "none of the samples of disturbed galaxies are discrepant from the  all \" sample at the @xmath6 level .",
    "these results are robust with reasonable changes in the concentration parameter used . if we instead use c=6 , which is more accurate for the dark matter distribution for halos of this mass @xcite , the k - s statistics are largely unchanged . additionally , we tested a range of coefficients ( @xmath81 ) for the decay time behavior of tidal streams and , based on the one to two percent changes on the k - s probabilities , affirm that our conclusions are independent of modest changes to the choice of the coefficient .",
    "we find that this toy model , in which the lifetime of the features is proportional to the local dynamical time and the generation of tidal features is independent of time or clustercentric radius , qualitatively agrees with the observed deficit of tidal features at small clustercentric radii , but possibly would not solely account for the magnitude of the deficit within @xmath4 .",
    "when considering the effect of environment on cluster galaxies there is always a tension between the role of global vs. local environment .",
    "part of the difficulty in addressing such issues is that the two measures of environment are correlated , and therefore large samples are needed to even begin to attempt to disentangle the two .",
    "a second difficulty is that local environment is inherently difficult to measure in clusters due to the complicated line - of - sight structure and relatively poor distance estimates .",
    "here we make an attempt to study the dependence of tidal features on local density , but we face these same difficulties .",
    "we quantify the local density using the standard measure of the projected distance to the 10th nearest galaxy with @xmath82 that is also within the cluster s red sequence in an attempt to mitigate contamination .",
    "we find no evidence that the rate of tidal features is dependent on local density as both the visual and the cleaned - auto samples differ from the full cluster sample at less than @xmath6 significance using a k - s test . we next attempt to remove the correlation between local density and clustercentric radius by dividing the galaxies into clustercentric annuli and within each annulus ranking galaxies uniformly by local density to range from 1 to 10 ( 10 being most dense ) .",
    "we then sum the density ranks of disturbed galaxies for all distance bins and compare that distribution to a random distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - density_radius_hist ] ) . by doing this",
    ", we are asking whether at each radius the galaxies with tidal features are preferentially in environments of either low or high local density .",
    "we find that disturbed galaxies have no statistically significant deviations in ranks from a random distribution .",
    "although we find no evidence for local density having an effect on the incidence of tidal features , we caution that this is simply an absence of evidence rather than evidence of an absence , particularly because our measurement of local density is so crude .",
    "in a sample of 54 galaxy clusters @xmath0 containing 3551 early - type galaxies suitable for study , we identify those with tidal features both interactively and automatically .",
    "this constitutes the largest sample studied to date for signs of environmental dependence in the incidence of tidal features .",
    "we find tidal features in @xmath1 3% of galaxies in this sample , with data of this particular depth .",
    "regardless of the method used to classify tidal features , or the fidelity imposed on such classifications , we find a deficit of tidally disturbed galaxies with decreasing clustercentric radius that is most pronounced inside of @xmath4 .",
    "although this trend could be attributed to a rise in galaxy - galaxy interactions at large clustercentric distances , where the galaxy pair velocities might be better tuned to mergers , an alternative interpretation is that tidal features are preferentially erased at small clustercentric radii .",
    "we examine this hypothesis with a simple toy model that links tidal feature survival time to the local dynamical time and find that although qualitatively the effect is in the correct sense to explain the data , the model falls somewhat short quantitatively .",
    "nevertheless , given the relative success and the limited statistics , we can not exclude this model as a possible explanation for the radial trend in the incidence of tidal tails .",
    "we also search for a dependence of the incidence of tidal features on local density and find no statistically significant evidence for such , even after accounting for the correlation between clustercentric radius and local density .",
    "unfortunately , the large uncertainties in the measure of local environment limit the interpretation of a null result .",
    "we demonstrate that interesting behavior exists in the rate of tidal features among cluster early - types as a function of clustercentric radius .",
    "this measure should provide some guidance for models of merging among early - types , which is conjectured to be significant in the build - up of the red sequence @xcite .",
    "models of merging in and around clusters should aim to provide merger estimates based on observable features rather than theoretical constructs .",
    "we expect that such work will provide strong constraints on the effect of the cluster environment on the structure of galaxy halos , the build - up of the red sequence of galaxies , and the origin of the intracluster stellar population .",
