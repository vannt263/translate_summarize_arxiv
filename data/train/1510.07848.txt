    "the quantum world is the realm of the most counter - intuitive phenomena , from the tunnel effect to the more recent quantum teleportation .",
    "there are , however , instances of quantum states which behave in an almost classical way .",
    "the best - known example of such a behavior is that of coherent states . with the rise of quantum information technology",
    "the need to identify genuine quantum states , where truly quantum phenomena could occur , has become important .",
    "several notions of `` quantumness '' exist , emphasizing different physical consequences of quantum behaviour .",
    "one of the oldest ones goes back to quantum optics , where coherent states of light are considered the most classical pure states possible .",
    "these are states with minimal quantum uncertainty in the quadratures , i.e.  localized as much as possible in phase space , and this property is preserved under the free time evolution of the electro - magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the purely classical procedure of randomly choosing such states adds classical noise but no quantum noise .",
    "the resulting mixed states , whose glauber representation is a convex sum of coherent state density matrices , form a convex set of states with positive @xmath0-function , and there is widespread agreement that such states are to be considered the most classical states @xcite .",
    "this definition was extended to finite - dimensional systems in @xcite , where spin - coherent states ( su(2 ) coherent states ) play the role of the pure states with minimal quantum fluctuations of the angular - momentum operators @xcite .",
    "this property is conserved under unitary operations representing rotations .",
    "a mixed state can be considered classical if it can be written as a statistical mixture of spin coherent states , meaning that a representation with a positive @xmath0-function exists .",
    "the set of `` classical spin states '' can thus be defined as the convex hull of spin coherent states @xcite .",
    "any state outside this set may be considered truly quantum . to measure the departure from the classical behaviour it is convenient to define `` quantumness '' as the hilbert - schmidt distance from the state to the set of classical states @xcite .",
    "other quantifiers of quantumness are based on different sets of `` classical states '' , e.g.  states with positive wigner function @xcite , and use various measures of distance , such as the trace distance @xcite or the bures distance @xcite .",
    "+ alternative measures of quantumness are based on entanglement @xcite . even though formal analogies of entanglement can be found also in classical physics , and have attracted attention recently in optics @xcite ,",
    "entanglement is a signature of a quantum behaviour",
    ". entangled quantum states can lead to stronger - than - classical correlations between subsystems .",
    "a number of entanglement measures have been proposed in order to quantify entanglement .",
    "a way of defining such a measure is to consider the distance between a state and the convex set of separable states . while this distance was shown to yield a good measure of entanglement when it is taken as the relative entropy or the bures distance  @xcite , it is currently still unclear whether the hilbert - schmidt distance yields a good measure of entanglement @xcite , as it is not contractive @xcite .",
    "however , this measure is mathematically convenient as a euclidean distance on hilbert space , and has nice physical properties .",
    "for instance the hilbert - schmidt distance is equal to the maximum amount by which a certain type of a generalized bell inequality is violated @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we show here that the hilbert - schmidt distance gives new insight into the geometry of entangled states .",
    "+ in the present paper , we investigate the problem of finding the distance from a state to the set of classical states , as well as the classical state closest to a given state .",
    "the closely related problem of finding the _ separable _ state closest to a given state has already been investigated in the literature .",
    "for instance , if one restricts the set of separable states to pure states then it was shown in @xcite that the closest separable pure state in terms of bures distance to a pure symmetric state is always symmetric .",
    "this result also holds for the hilbert - schmidt distance as both distances are simply related to the overlap of the two states in this pure state case . in @xcite , the problem of the hilbert - schmidt distance from a bipartite two qubit state to the closest ( possibly mixed ) separable state was investigated . specializing the results of @xcite to symmetric states",
    ", one can observe that the separable state closest to a symmetric state ( pure or not ) is in general mixed and not necessarily symmetric .",
    "here we solve the problem of finding the classical state closest to a general state , in terms of the hilbert - schmidt distance .",
    "we find an analytical solution for pure states .",
    "our findings generalize a result obtained in @xcite for the most quantum pure state .",
    "as we will see , this also solves the problem of finding the symmetric separable state closest to a pure symmetric bipartite state of two qubits .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ definitions ]",
    "we introduce the bloch matrix representation that we will use throughout the paper .",
    "section [ purespin1 ] solves the problem of finding the classical state closest to any given pure state , while section [ mixed ] tackles the problem for mixed states .",
    "section [ entanglement ] makes the connection with entanglement and entanglement measures .",
    "a way of representing spin-@xmath1 states which is particularly convenient when dealing with spin coherent states is the tensor representation proposed in @xcite .",
    "it is a generalization of the well - known bloch picture for spin-@xmath2 states . in the case",
    "@xmath3 , any state @xmath4 can be expanded as @xmath5 with @xmath6 the @xmath7 identity matrix , and @xmath8 , @xmath9 , the three pauli matrices . in this basis , the coordinates of @xmath4 are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , so that @xmath12 forms the usual bloch vector .    for higher spin , it is possible to associate to any spin-@xmath1 state @xmath4 a tensor with @xmath13 indices @xcite .",
    "for spin-1 this tensor reduces to a matrix that can be defined as @xmath14 with @xmath15 , the @xmath16 identity matrix , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the usual spin-1 angular momentum operator , @xmath20 ( here we take @xmath21 ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath22 are such that @xmath4 can be expanded as @xmath23 the @xmath24 matrix @xmath25 is real and symmetric with trace two . as in the spin-@xmath2 case , where the bloch vector transforms as a three - dimensional vector under rotations of the coordinate frame , for spin-1 , @xmath25 transforms under a 3d rotation according to @xmath26 , with @xmath27 , @xmath28 , the @xmath16 rotation matrix , and @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "we will thus call @xmath25 the bloch matrix .",
    "this representation is particularly well - suited to our problem , since , as we will see , coherent states take a very simple form in this framework .",
    "the set @xmath31 of classical spin states is defined @xcite as the ensemble of all density matrices which can be expressed as a mixture of spin coherent states with positive weights , i.e.  states @xmath32 for which there exist weights @xmath33 and coherent states @xmath34 such that @xmath35 with @xmath36 , and @xmath37 .",
    "here we use the following definition of spin coherent states @xmath38 , with @xmath39 $ ] and @xmath40 the usual spherical angles , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the usual spin basis , here with @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the bloch matrix of a coherent state takes the simple form @xmath45 , @xmath46 , with @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the decomposition can be reexpressed in terms of the bloch matrix @xmath49 of @xmath32 as @xmath50 with @xmath51 the bloch vectors corresponding to coherent states @xmath34 and @xmath52 .",
    "quantumness of an arbitrary state @xmath4 can be defined @xcite as the ( hilbert - schmidt ) distance to the convex set @xmath31 .",
    "namely , the quantumness @xmath53 is given by @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the hilbert - schmidt norm . using eq .",

    "a necessary and sufficient criterion for classicality in the spin-1 case was obtained .",
    "a spin-@xmath57 state is classical if and only if the @xmath58 matrix @xmath59 defined ( using the present notation ) by @xmath60 , with @xmath61 , is positive semi - definite . remarkably , the matrix @xmath59 is nothing but the schur complement of the @xmath62 upper left block of matrix @xmath25 ( note that @xmath63 ) .",
    "therefore positive semi - definiteness of @xmath59 is equivalent to positive semi - definiteness of @xmath25 . in other words ,",
    "a spin-1 state is classical if and only if its matrix @xmath25 is positive semi - definite .",
    "equivalently , a spin-1 state is quantum if and only if the smallest eigenvalue of its matrix @xmath25 is negative .",
    "the bloch matrix thus provides a simple classicality criterion . in the case of pure states , it also allows one to obtain an exact expression for the quantumness .",
    "this is the goal of the next section .",
    "starting from a one - dimensional parametrization of pure states , we now prove a lower bound to the minimization problem and then show that this lower bound can be reached by a classical state .",
    "this gives an analytic expression for @xmath64 for all pure states .",
    "the majorana representation @xcite allows one to uniquely map any pure spin-@xmath1 state to @xmath13 points on the bloch sphere .",
    "if the pure state undergoes a unitary transformation @xmath65 that represents a rotation of angle @xmath66 about vector @xmath67 then the majorana points are rotated rigidly by that rotation .",
    "under such a transformation , coherent states are rotated into coherent states , so that from its definition it is clear that quantumness is invariant under rotation of the coordinate system . moreover , since @xmath25 transforms under rotations as explained in section [ sec.tenrep ] , its eigenvalues are unchanged under such rotations .",
    "the majorana representation of a spin-1 pure state @xmath68 just consists of two points on the unit sphere .",
    "these points correspond , via the stereographic projection @xmath69 , to the roots of the majorana polynomial @xmath70 , with @xmath71 , the coefficients of the state @xmath68 in the @xmath42 basis .",
    "the sphere ( or the spin-1 state ) can always be rotated in such a way that these two majorana points are brought to a canonical position where they have spherical coordinates @xmath72 and @xmath73 without changing quantumness .",
    "states with majorana points at positions @xmath74 and @xmath73 are given ( up to normalisation @xmath75 ) by @xmath76 with @xmath77 $ ] .",
    "we will use this expression as a canonical form for spin-1 pure states .",
    "the corresponding bloch matrix @xmath25 is given by @xmath78 with @xmath79 the eigenvalues of @xmath25 are @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",

    "we will use @xmath84 as the parameter for spin-1 pure states .    according to the criterion of section [ section quantumness ] ,",
    "a state @xmath4 is classical if and only if @xmath25 is positive semi - definite , that is , if and only if @xmath86 .",
    "for pure states , since @xmath87 $ ] this implies that @xmath88 .",
    "the bloch matrix then corresponds to the bloch matrix of a coherent state with vector @xmath89 .",
    "another way of seeing this is to note that @xmath88 is equivalent to @xmath90 , which corresponds to both majorana points coinciding , i.e.  a coherent state .",
    "we recover the known fact that the only classical pure states are coherent states .",
    "we now show that for an arbitrary pure state @xmath91 whose bloch matrix @xmath25 has smallest eigenvalue @xmath84 , quantumness is such that @xmath92 without loss of generality , the quantumness of @xmath91 can be calculated by first transforming it to the canonical form",

    "indeed , if @xmath225 is symmetric then @xmath226 with @xmath227 .",
    "this is equivalent to @xmath228 since all summands are non - negative ( by positivity of density matrices ) it follows that @xmath229 if the qubit states @xmath230 are written with the bloch vectors @xmath231 according to eq .  , direct calculations give @xmath232 because the bloch vectors are such that @xmath233 , eq .",
    "implies that @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "thus @xmath236 , which corresponds to the same pure qubit state @xmath237",
    ". therefore one can write @xmath238 with it follows that @xmath225 can be identified with @xmath239 which represents a classical state .",
    "thus , the set of classical spin-1 states can be identified with the set of separable symmetric states of two qubits . +",
    "this equivalence can also be shown indirectly using the ppt criterion .",
    "indeed , there is a remarkable connection between the partial transpose of a state @xmath4 and the bloch matrix @xmath25 of @xmath4 .",
    "namely , one can easily check that @xmath240 with the unitary matrix @xmath241 therefore the bloch matrix is nothing but the partial transpose of @xmath4 expressed in a different basis . as shown in section [ section quantumness ] , a necessary and sufficient condition for classicality is that @xmath25 be positive semi - definite . as the eigenvalues are unchanged by the change of basis ( but for a factor @xmath2 ) , this condition is equivalent to the positive semi - definiteness of @xmath203 , which in turn is equivalent to separability . in other words , this proves that a spin-1 state is entangled ( when seen as a bipartite system ) if and only if its quantumness is non - zero .    any separable state",
    "can be written in the form , with possibly @xmath242 .",
    "if that state lies in the subspace spanned by , then necessarily , from the considerations above , @xmath243 , so that @xmath4 can be cast in the form @xmath244 with @xmath245 spin-@xmath2 coherent states , that is , a form where the particle - exchange invariance appears also on the level of the density matrix .      in section [ purespin1 ] and [ mixed ] we related quantumness of a state @xmath4 to the smallest eigenvalue of its bloch matrix .",
    "if this smallest eigenvalue is denoted by @xmath84 , then from the correspondence , the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath203 is equal to @xmath246 . in the case of a bipartition of two spin-@xmath2 states",
    ", @xmath203 has at most one negative eigenvalue @xcite , so that negativity reduces to @xmath247 . in the case of pure states , the concurrence defined in reduces to @xmath248 of course , as is expected for pure states , the negativity and the concurrence are simply related by @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath149 defined in thus allows us to express quantumness as function of negativity for pure spin-1 states . for mixed spin-1 states",
    "( [ upperboundmixed ] ) becomes @xmath250 and as we showed equality holds for pure states .",
    "furthermore , it gives an insight into the geometry of entangled states as it allows one to connect negativity to a geometric property , namely the hilbert - schmidt distance @xmath251 from an entangled state to the set @xmath31 of symmetric separable states .",
    "in general , since the closest separable state found in @xcite is non - symmetric , the corresponding minimal hilbert - schmidt distance obtained in @xcite is smaller than the one we get as we consider the distance to symmetric separable states only .",
    "in this paper we investigated the quantumness of states , defined as hilbert - schmidt distance to the convex set of classical spin-1 states .",
    "we found the analytical solution for the quantumness @xmath252 of arbitrary pure states .",
    "it can be expressed as a function of the smallest eigenvalue of the bloch matrix associated with @xmath68 .",
    "for mixed states , the same function appears to give an upper bound for @xmath53 according to extensive numerical investigations .",
    "we established the connection of @xmath53 with entanglement measures .",
    "the closest classical state also provides a classicality witness , in the spirit of @xcite .",
