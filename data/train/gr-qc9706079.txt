    "subrahmanyan chandrasekhar and i entered the field of relativistic astrophysics at the same time , in the early 1960s ",
    "i as a green graduate student at princeton ; chandra as an estabilished and famous researcher at the university of chicago . over the decades of the 60 s , 70 s and 80 s , and into the 90 s , chandra , i , and our friends and colleagues had the great pleasure of exploring general relativity s predictions about the properties of black holes and relativistic stars . throughout these explorations",
    "chandra was an inspiration for us all .",
    "when we began , there was no observational evidence that black holes or relativistic stars exist in the universe , much less that they play important roles .",
    "however , in parallel with our theoretical studies , astronomers discovered pulsars and quickly deduced they are spinning neutron stars in which relativistic effects should be strong ; astronomers also discovered quasars , and gradually , over three decades time , came to understand that they are powered by supermassive black holes ; astronomers discovered compact x - ray sources and quickly deduced they are binary systems in which gas accretes from a normal star onto a stellar - mass black - hole companion or neutron - star companion ; and astronomers discovered gamma ray bursts , and after nearly three decades of puzzlement , have concluded they are probably produced by the final merger of a neutron - star /neutron - star binary or a neutron - star / black - hole binary .    despite this growing richness of astrophysical phenomena",
    "in which black holes and neutron stars play major roles , those of us who use general relativity to predict the properties of these objects have been frustrated : in the rich astronomical data there as yet is little evidence for the holes and stars spacetime warpage , which is so central to our theoretical studies .",
    "if we had to rely solely on observations and not at all on theory , we could still argue , in 1997 , that a black hole is a flat - spacetime , newtonian phenomenon and neutron stars are un - influenced by general relativistic effects .    why this frustration ? perhaps because spacetime warpage can not , itself , produce the only kinds of radiation that astronomers now have at their disposal : electromagnetic waves , neutrinos , and cosmic rays . to explore spacetime warpage in detail",
    "may well require using , instead , the only kind of radiation that such warpage can produce : radiation made of spacetime warpage  gravitational waves .    in this article",
    ", i shall describe the prospects for using gravitational waves to probe the warpage of spacetime around black holes and relativistic stars , and to search for new types of general relativistic objects , for which there as yet is no observational evidence .",
    "and i shall describe how the challenge of developing data analysis algorithms for gravitational - wave detectors is already driving the theory of black holes and relativistic stars just as hard as the theory is driving the wave - detection efforts .",
    "already , several years before the full - scale detectors go into operation , the challenge of transforming general relativistic astrophysics into an observational science has transformed the nature of our theoretical enterprise . at",
    "last , after 35 years of only weak coupling to observation , those of us studying general relativistic aspects of black holes and stars have become tightly coupled to the observational / experimental enterprise .",
    "a gravitational wave is a ripple of warpage ( curvature ) in the `` fabric '' of spacetime . according to general relativity ,",
    "gravitational waves are produced by the dynamical spacetime warpage of distant astrophysical systems , and they travel outward from their sources and through the universe at the speed of light , becoming very weak by the time they reach the earth . einstein discovered gravitational waves as a prediction of his general relativity theory in 1916 , but only in the late 1950s did the technology of high - precision measurement become good enough to justify an effort to construct detectors for the waves .",
    "gravitational - wave detectors and detection techniques have now been under development for nearly 40 years , building on foundations laid by joseph weber @xcite , rainer weiss @xcite , and others .",
    "these efforts have led to promising sensitivities in four frequency bands , and theoretical studies have identified plausible sources in each band :    * the extremely low frequency band ( elf ) , @xmath0 to @xmath1 hz , in which the measured anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background radiation places strong limits on gravitational wave strengths  and may , in fact , have detected waves @xcite .",
    "the only waves expected in this band are relics of the big bang , a subject beyond the scope of this article .",
    "( for some details and references see @xcite and references cited therein . ) * the very low frequency band ( vlf ) , @xmath2 to @xmath3 hz , in which joseph taylor and others have achieved remarkable gravity - wave sensitivities by the timing of millisecond pulsars @xcite .",
    "the only expected strong sources in this band are processes in the very early universe  the big bang , phase transitions of the vacuum states of quantum fields , and vibrating or colliding defects in the structure of spacetime , such as monopoles , cosmic strings , domain walls , textures , and combinations thereof @xcite .",
    "these sources are also beyond the scope of this article . * the low - frequency band ( lf ) , @xmath4 to 1 hz",
    ", in which will operate the laser interferometer space antenna , lisa ; see sec .",
    "[ lisa ] below .",
    "this is the band of massive black holes ( @xmath5 to @xmath6 ) in the distant universe , and of other hypothetical massive exotic objects ( naked singularities , soliton stars ) , as well as of binary stars ( ordinary , white dwarf , neutron star , and black hole ) in our galaxy .",
    "early universe processes should also have produced waves at these frequencies , as in the elf and vlf bands .",
    "* the high - frequency band ( hf ) , @xmath7 to @xmath8hz , in which operate earth - based gravitational - wave detectors such as ligo ; see secs .",
    "[ gbint][narrowband ] below .",
    "this is the band of stellar - mass black holes ( @xmath9 to @xmath10 ) and of other conceivable stellar - mass exotic objects ( naked singularities and boson stars ) in the distant universe , as well as of supernovae , pulsars , and coalescing and colliding neutron stars .",
    "early universe processes should also have produced waves at these frequencies , as in the elf , vlf , and lf bands .    in this article",
    "i shall focus on the hf and lf bands , because these are the ones in which we can expect to study black holes and relativistic stars .",
    "one aspect of a gravitational wave s spacetime warpage  the only aspect relevant to earth - based detectors  is an oscillatory `` stretching and squeezing '' of space .",
    "this stretch and squeeze is described , in general relativity theory , by two dimensionless gravitational wave fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( the `` strains of space '' ) that are associated with the wave s two linear polarizations , conventionally called `` plus '' ( @xmath13 ) and `` cross '' ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 , technically speaking , are the double time integrals of space - time - space - time components of the riemann curvature tensor ; and they propagate through spacetime at the speed of light . the inertia of any small piece of an object tries to keep it at rest in , or moving at constant speed through , the piece of space in which it resides",
    "; so as @xmath11 and @xmath12 stretch and squeeze space , inertia stretches and squeezes objects that reside in that space .",
    "this stretch and squeeze is analogous to the tidal gravitational stretch and squeeze exerted on the earth by the moon , and thus the associated gravitational - wave force is referred to as a `` tidal '' force .",
    "if an object is small compared to the waves wavelength ( as is the case for ground - based detectors ) , then relative to the object s center , the waves exert tidal forces with the quadrupolar patterns shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : forcelines ] .",
    "the names `` plus '' and `` cross '' are derived from the orientations of the axes that characterize the force patterns @xcite .",
    "9.pc    the strengths of the waves from a gravitational - wave source can be estimated using the `` newtonian / quadrupole '' approximation to the einstein field equations .",
    "this approximation says that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the second time derivative of the source s quadrupole moment , @xmath17 is the distance of the source from earth ( and @xmath18 and @xmath19 are newton s gravitation constant and the speed of light ) .",
    "the strongest sources will be highly nonspherical and thus will have @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is their mass and @xmath22 their size , and correspondingly will have @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is their internal velocity and @xmath25 is the nonspherical part of their internal kinetic energy .",
    "this provides us with the estimate @xmath26 i.e. , @xmath27 is about 4 times the gravitational potential produced at earth by the mass - equivalent of the source s nonspherical , internal kinetic energy  made dimensionless by dividing by @xmath28 .",
    "thus , in order to radiate strongly , the source must have a very large , nonspherical , internal kinetic energy .",
    "the best known way to achieve a huge internal kinetic energy is via gravity ; and by energy conservation ( or the virial theorem ) , any gravitationally - induced kinetic energy must be of order the source s gravitational potential energy . a huge potential energy , in turn , requires that the source be very compact , not much larger than its own gravitational radius .",
    "thus , the strongest gravity - wave sources must be highly compact , dynamical concentrations of large amounts of mass ( e.g. , colliding and coalescing black holes and neutron stars ) .",
    "such sources can not remain highly dynamical for long ; their motions will be stopped by energy loss to gravitational waves and/or the formation of an all - encompassing black hole .",
    "thus , the strongest sources should be transient .",
    "moreover , they should be very rare ",
    "so rare that to see a reasonable event rate will require reaching out through a substantial fraction of the universe .",
    "thus , just as the strongest radio waves arriving at earth tend to be extragalactic , so also the strongest gravitational waves are likely to be extragalactic .    for highly compact , dynamical objects that radiate in the high - frequency band , e.g.  colliding and coalescing neutron stars and stellar - mass black holes , the internal ,",
    "nonspherical kinetic energy @xmath29 is of order the mass of the sun ; and , correspondingly , eq .  ( [ hom ] ) gives @xmath30 for such sources at the hubble distance ( 3000 mpc , i.e. , @xmath31 light years ) ; @xmath32 at 200 mpc ( a best - guess distance for several neutron - star coalescences per year ; see section [ nsnsinspiral ] ) , @xmath33 at the virgo cluster of galaxies ( 15 mpc ) ; and @xmath34 in the outer reaches of our own milky way galaxy ( 20 kpc ) .",
    "these numbers set the scale of sensitivities that ground - based interferometers seek to achieve : @xmath35 to @xmath36 .",
    "13.2pc    the most promising and versatile type of gravitational - wave detector in the high - frequency band , @xmath7 to @xmath8hz , is a laser interferometer gravitational wave detector ( `` interferometer '' for short ) .",
    "such an interferometer consists of four mirror - endowed masses that hang from vibration - isolated supports as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometer ] , and the indicated optical system for monitoring the separations between the masses @xcite .",
    "two masses are near each other , at the corner of an `` l '' , and one mass is at the end of each of the l s long arms .",
    "the arm lengths are nearly equal , @xmath37 .",
    "when a gravitational wave , with frequencies high compared to the masses @xmath38 hz pendulum frequency , passes through the detector , it pushes the masses back and forth relative to each other as though they were free from their suspension wires , thereby changing the arm - length difference , @xmath39 .",
    "that change is monitored by laser interferometry in such a way that the variations in the output of the photodiode ( the interferometer s output ) are directly proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "if the waves are coming from overhead or underfoot and the axes of the @xmath13 polarization coincide with the arms directions , then it is the waves @xmath13 polarization that drives the masses , and the detector s",
    "strain @xmath41 is equal to the waves strain of space @xmath42 . more generally , the interferometer s output is a linear combination of the two wave fields : @xmath43 the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 are of order unity and depend in a quadrupolar manner on the direction to the source and the orientation of the detector @xcite .",

    ", an interferometer must have an arm length @xmath50 to 10 km in order to achieve the desired wave sensitivities , @xmath51 to @xmath36 .",
    "this sets the scale of the interferometers that are now under construction .",
    "interferometers are plagued by non - gaussian noise , e.g.  due to sudden strain releases in the wires that suspend the masses .",
    "this noise prevents a single interferometer , by itself , from detecting with confidence short - duration gravitational - wave bursts ( though it may be possible for a single interferometer to search for the periodic waves from known pulsars ) .",
    "the non - gaussian noise can be removed by cross correlating two , or preferably three or more , interferometers that are networked together at widely separated sites .",
    "the technology and techniques for such interferometers have been under development for 25 years , and plans for km - scale interferometers have been developed over the past 15 years .",
    "an international network consisting of three km - scale interferometers at three widely separated sites is now under construction .",
    "it includes two sites of the american ligo project ( `` laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory '' ) @xcite , and one site of the french / italian virgo project ( named after the virgo cluster of galaxies ) @xcite .",
    "ligo will consist of two vacuum facilities with 4-kilometer - long arms , one in hanford , washington ( in the northwestern united states ) and the other in livingston , louisiana ( in the southeastern united states ) .",
    "these facilities are designed to house many successive generations of interferometers without the necessity of any major facilities upgrade ; and after a planned future expansion , they will be able to house several interferometers at once , each with a different optical configuration optimized for a different type of wave ( e.g. , broad - band burst , or narrow - band periodic wave , or stochastic wave ) .",
    "the ligo facilities are being constructed by a team of about 80 physicists and engineers at caltech and mit , led by barry barish ( the pi ) , gary sanders ( the project manager ) , albert lazzarini , rai weiss , stan whitcomb , and robbie vogt ( who directed the project during the pre - construction phase ) .",
    "this caltech / mit team , together with researchers from several other universities , is developing ligo s first interferometers and their data analysis system .",
    "other research groups from many universities are contributing to r&d for _ enhancements _ of the first interferometers , or are computing theoretical waveforms for use in data analysis , or are developing data analysis techniques for future interferometers .",

    "the interferometer sensitivity @xmath53 is to be compared with the `` characteristic amplitude '' @xmath58 of the waves from a source ; here @xmath27 is the waves amplitude when they have frequency @xmath59 , and @xmath60 is the number of cycles the waves spend in a bandwidth @xmath54 near frequency @xmath59 @xcite .",

    "spiral inward , their waves sweep upward in frequency ( rightward across the figure along the dashed lines ) . from the figure",
    "we see that ligo s first interferometers should be able to detect waves from the inspiral of a ns / ns binary out to a distance of 30mpc ( 90 million light years ) and from the final collision and merger of a @xmath64 bh / bh binary out to about 300mpc .",
    "comparison with estimated event rates ( secs .",
    "[ nsnsinspiral ] and [ bhbhstrength ] below ) suggests , with considerable confidence , that the first wave detections will be achieved by the time the enhanced sensitivity is reached and possibly as soon as the first - interferometers searches .",
    "ligo alone , with its two sites which have parallel arms , will be able to detect an incoming gravitational wave , measure one of its two waveforms , and ( from the time delay between the two sites ) locate its source to within a @xmath65 wide annulus on the sky .",
    "ligo and virgo together , operating as a _ coordinated international network _",
    ", will be able to locate the source ( via time delays plus the interferometers beam patterns ) to within a 2-dimensional error box with size between several tens of arcminutes and several degrees , depending on the source direction and on the amount of high - frequency structure in the waveforms .",
    "they will also be able to monitor both waveforms @xmath42 and @xmath47 ( except for frequency components above about 1khz and below about 10 hz , where the interferometers noise becomes severe ) .",
    "a british / german group is constructing a 600-meter interferometer called geo 600 near hanover germany @xcite , and japanese groups , a 300-meter interferometer called tama near tokyo @xcite .",
    "geo600 may be a significant player in the interferometric network in its early years ( by virtue of cleverness and speed of construction ) , but because of its short arms it can not compete in the long run .",
    "geo600 and tama will both be important development centers and testbeds for interferometer techniques and technology , and in due course they may give rise to kilometer - scale interferometers like ligo and virgo , which could significantly enhance the network s all - sky coverage and ability to extract information from the waves .      at frequencies",
    "@xmath66hz , the interferometers photon shot noise becomes a serious obstacle to wave detection .",
    "however , narrow - band detectors specially optimized for khz frequencies show considerable promise .",
    "these include interferometers with specialized optical configurations ( `` signal recycled interferometers '' @xcite and `` resonant sideband extraction interferometers '' @xcite ) , and large spherical or truncated icosahedral resonant - mass detectors ( e.g. , the american tiga @xcite , dutch grail @xcite and brazilian omni-1 projects ) that are future variants of joseph weber s original `` bar '' detector @xcite and of currently operating bars in italy ( auriga , explorer and nautilus ) , australia ( niobe ) , and america ( allegro ) @xcite .",

    ", the flight could be much sooner .",
    "15.8pc    as presently conceived @xcite , lisa will consist of six compact , drag - free spacecraft ( i.e. spacecraft that are shielded from buffeting by solar wind and radiation pressure , and that thus move very nearly on geodesics of spacetime ) .",
    "all six spacecraft would be launched simultaneously in a single ariane rocket .",
    "they would be placed into the same heliocentric orbit as the earth occupies , but would follow 20@xmath67 behind the earth ; cf .",
    "[ fig : lisa_orbit ] .",
    "the spacecraft would fly in pairs , with each pair at the vertex of an equilateral triangle that is inclined at an angle of 60@xmath67 to the earth s orbital plane . the triangle s arm length would be 5 million km ( @xmath68 times longer than ligo s arms ! ) .",
    "the six spacecraft would track each other optically , using one - watt yag laser beams . because of diffraction losses over the @xmath69 km arm length , it is not feasible to reflect the beams back and forth between mirrors as is done with ligo . instead , each spacecraft would have its own laser ; and the lasers would be phase locked to each other , thereby achieving the same kind of phase - coherent out - and - back light travel as ligo achieves with mirrors .",
    "the six - laser , six - spacecraft configuration thereby would function as three , partially independent and partially redundant , gravitational - wave interferometers .",
    "figure [ fig : lisa_noise ] depicts the expected sensitivity of lisa in the same language as we have used for ligo ( fig.[fig : ligosources ] ) : @xmath70 is the sensitivity for high - confidence detection ( @xmath71 ) of a signal coming from a random direction , assuming gaussian noise .",

    "below @xmath74hz , the noise is due to buffeting - induced random motions of the spacecraft that are not being properly removed by the drag - compensation system .",
    "notice that , in terms of dimensionless amplitude , lisa s sensitivity is roughly the same as that of ligo s first interferometers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ligosources ] ) , but at 100,000 times lower frequency . since the waves energy flux scales as @xmath75",
    ", this corresponds to @xmath31 better energy sensitivity than ligo .",
    "lisa can detect and study , simultaneously , a wide variety of different sources scattered over all directions on the sky .",
    "the key to distinguishing the different sources is the different time evolution of their waveforms .",
    "the key to determining each source s direction , and confirming that it is real and not just noise , is the manner in which its waves amplitude and frequency are modulated by lisa s complicated orbital motion  a motion in which the interferometer triangle rotates around its center once per year , and the interferometer plane precesses around the normal to the earth s orbit once per year .",
    "most sources will be observed for a year or longer , thereby making full use of these modulations .",
    "in the remainder of this article , i shall describe the techniques and prospects for observationally studying black holes and relativistic stars via the gravitational waves they emit .",
    "i begin with the births of stellar - mass neutron stars and black holes .",
    "when the core of a massive star has exhausted its supply of nuclear fuel , it collapses to form a neutron star or a black hole . in some cases , the collapse triggers and powers a subsequent explosion of the star s mantle  a supernova explosion . despite extensive theoretical efforts for more than 30 years , and despite wonderful observational data from supernova 1987a ,",
    "theorists are still far from a definitive understanding of the details of the collapse and explosion .",
    "the details are highly complex and may differ greatly from one core collapse to another @xcite .",
    "several features of the collapse and the core s subsequent evolution can produce significant gravitational radiation in the high - frequency band .",
    "we shall consider these features in turn , the most weakly radiating first , and we shall focus primarily on collapses that produce neutron stars rather than black holes .      even if the collapse is spherical , so it can not radiate any gravitational waves at all , it should produce a convectively unstable neutron star that `` boils '' vigorously ( and nonspherically ) for the first @xmath38 second of its life @xcite .",
    "the boiling dredges up high - temperature nuclear matter ( @xmath76k ) from the neutron star s central regions , bringing it to the surface ( to the `` neutrino - sphere '' ) , where it cools by neutrino emission before being swept back downward and reheated .",
    "burrows @xcite has pointed out that the boiling should generate @xmath77 cycles of gravitational waves with frequency @xmath78hz and amplitude large enough to be detectable by ligo / virgo throughout our galaxy and its satellites .",
    "neutrino detectors have a similar range , and there could be a high scientific payoff from correlated observations of the gravitational waves emitted by the boiling s mass motions and neutrinos emitted from the boiling neutrino - sphere . with neutrinos to trigger on , the sensitivities of ligo detectors should be about twice as good as shown in fig.[fig : ligosources ] .",
    "recent 3 + 1 dimensional simulations by mller and janka @xcite suggest an rms amplitude @xmath79 ( where @xmath17 is the distance to the source ) , corresponding to a characteristic amplitude @xmath80 ; cf .",
    "[ fig : ligosources ] .",
    "( the older 2 + 1 dimensional simulations gave @xmath62 about 6 times larger than this @xcite , but presumably were less reliable . )",
    "ligo should be able to detect such waves throughout our galaxy with an amplitude signal to noise ratio of about @xmath81 in each of its two enhanced 4 km interferometers , and its advanced interferometers should do the same out to 80mpc distance .",
    "( recall that the @xmath82 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ligosources ] are drawn at a signal to noise ratio of about 5 ) .",
    "although the estimated event rate is only about one every 40 years in our galaxy and not much larger out to 80mpc , if just one such supernova is detected the correlated neutrino and gravitational wave observations could bring very interesting insights into the boiling of a newborn neutron star .",
    "rotation will centrifugally flatten the collapsing core , enabling it to radiate as it implodes . if the core s angular momentum is small enough that centrifugal forces do not halt or strongly slow the collapse before it reaches nuclear densities , then the core s collapse , bounce , and subsequent oscillations are likely to be axially symmetric .",
    "numerical simulations @xcite show that in this case the waves from collapse , bounce , and oscillation will be quite weak : the total energy radiated as gravitational waves is not likely to exceed @xmath83 solar masses ( about 1 part in a million of the collapse energy ) and might often be much less than this ; and correspondingly , the waves characteristic amplitude will be @xmath84 .",
    "these collapse - and - bounce waves will come off at frequencies @xmath85 hz to @xmath86 hz , and will precede the boiling waves by a fraction of a second .",
    "though a little stronger than the boiling waves , they probably can not be seen by ligo / virgo beyond the local group of galaxies and thus will be a very rare occurrence .",
    "if the core s rotation is large enough to strongly flatten the core before or as it reaches nuclear density , then a dynamical or secular instability is likely to break the core s axisymmetry .",
    "the core will be transformed into a bar - like configuration that spins end - over - end like an american football , and that might even break up into two or more massive pieces . as we shall see below , the radiation from the spinning bar or orbiting pieces _ could _ be almost as strong as that from a coalescing neutron - star binary ( sec .",
    "[ nsnsinspiral ] ) , and thus could be seen by the ligo / virgo first interferometers out to the distance of the virgo cluster ( where the supernova rate is several per year ) , by enhanced interferometers out to @xmath87mpc ( supernova rate several thousand per year ) , and by advanced interferometers out to several hundred mpc ( supernova rate @xmath88 per year ) ; cf .",
    "[ fig : ligosources ] .",
    "it is far from clear what fraction of collapsing cores will have enough angular momentum to break their axisymmetry , and what fraction of those will actually radiate at this high rate ; but even if only @xmath89 or @xmath90 do so , this could ultimately be a very interesting source for ligo / virgo .",
    "several specific scenarios for such non - axisymmetry have been identified :    * centrifugal hangup at @xmath91 km radius : * if the pre - collapse core is rapidly spinning ( e.g. , if it is a white dwarf that has been spun up by accretion from a companion ) , then the collapse may produce a highly flattened , centrifugally supported disk with most of its mass at radii @xmath92 km , which then ( via instability ) may transform itself into a bar or may bifurcate .",
    "the bar or bifurcated lumps will radiate gravitational waves at twice their rotation frequency , @xmath78hz  the optimal frequency for ligo / virgo interferometers . to shrink on down to @xmath93 km size ,",

    "however , for bh / bh binaries with total mass @xmath187 to 50@xmath63 that arise from ordinary main - sequence progenitors , estimates based on the progenitors birth rates and on simulations of their subsequent evolution suggest a coalescence rate in our galaxy of one per ( 1 to 30 ) million years @xcite .",
    "these rough estimates imply that to see one coalescence per year with @xmath187 to @xmath188 , ligo / virgo must reach out to a distance @xmath189300 to 900 ) mpc . other plausible scenarios ( e.g. bh / bh binary formation in dense stellar clusters that reside in globular clusters and galactic nuclei @xcite )",
    "could produce higher event rates and larger masses , but little reliable is known about them ( cf .  sec .",
    "i.a.ii of @xcite ) .    for comparison , the first ligo interferometers can reach 300mpc for @xmath190 but only 40mpc for @xmath191 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ligo1bh ] ) ; enhanced interferometers can reach about 10 times farther , and advanced interferometers about 30 times farther ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ligoadvbh ] .",
    "these numbers suggest that ( i ) if waves from bh / bh coalescences are not detected by the first ligo / virgo interferometers , they are likely to be detected along the way from the first interferometers to the enhanced ; and ( ii ) bh / bh coalescences might be detected sooner than ns / ns coalescences ( cf.sec .",
    "[ nsnsinspiral ] ) .",
    "22.6pc    for binaries with @xmath192 , the highly interesting merger signal should be stronger than the inspiral signal , and for @xmath193 , the ringdown should be stronger than inspiral ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ligo1bh ] ) .",
    "thus , it may well be that early in the life of the ligo / virgo network , observers and theorists will be struggling to understand the merger of binary black holes by comparison of computed and observed waveforms .",
    "ligo s advanced interferometers ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ligoadvbh ] ) can see the merger waves , for @xmath194 ) out to a cosmological redshift @xmath195 ; and for binaries at @xmath196 in this mass range , they can achieve a signal to noise ratio ( assuming optimal signal processing @xcite ) of about 25 in each interferometer .",
    "while these numbers are impressive , they pale by comparison with lisa ( fig.[fig : lisabh ] ) , which can detect the merger waves for @xmath197 out to redshifts @xmath198 ( far earlier in the life of the universe than the era when the first supermassive black holes are likely to have formed ) .",
    "correspondingly , lisa can achieve signal to noise ratios of thousands for mergers with @xmath199 at redshifts of order unity , and from the inspiral waves can infer the binary s parameters ( redshifted masses , luminosity distance , direction , ... ) with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "22.6pc    unfortunately , it is far from obvious whether the event rate for such supermassive bh / bh coalescences will be interestingly high .",
    "conservative estimates suggest a rate of @xmath200yr , while plausible scenarios for aspects of the universe about which we are rather ignorant can give rates as high as 1000/yr @xcite .",
    "if the coalescence rate is only 0.1/yr , then lisa should still see @xmath184 bh / bh binaries with @xmath201 that are @xmath202 years away from their final merger .",
    "these slowly inspiraling binaries should be visible , with one year of integration , out to a redshift @xmath203 ( bottom part of fig .",
    "[ fig : lisabh ] ) .",
    "among the scientific payoffs that should come from ligo / virgo s and/or lisa s observations of binary coalescence are the following ; others have been discussed above .      as the gravitational waves from a binary s coalescence depart from their source , the waves energy creates ( via the nonlinearity of einstein s field equations ) a secondary wave called the `` christodoulou memory '' @xcite .",
    "this memory , arriving at earth , can be regarded rigorously as the combined gravitational field of all the gravitons that have been emitted in directions other than toward the earth @xcite .",
    "the memory builds up on the timescale of the primary energy emission profile , and grows most rapidly when the primary waves are being emitted most strongly : during the end of inspiral and the merger .",
    "unfortunately , the memory is so weak that in ligo only advanced interferometers have much chance of detecting and studying it  and then , only for bh / bh coalescences and not for ns / ns @xcite .",
    "lisa , by contrast , should easily be able to measure the memory from supermassive bh / bh coalescences .",
    "corresponding to the very high post - newtonian order to which a binary s inspiral waveforms must be computed for use in ligo / virgo and lisa data analysis ( sec .",
    "[ inspiralwaveforms ] ) , measurements of the inspiral waveforms can be used to test general relativity with very high accuracy .",
    "for example , in scalar - tensor theories ( some of which are attractive alternatives to general relativity @xcite ) , radiation reaction due to emission of scalar waves places a unique signature on the measured inspiral waveforms  a signature that can be searched for with high precision @xcite .",
    "similarly , the inspiral waveforms can be used to measure with high accuracy several fascinating general relativistic phenomena in addition to the christodoulou memory : the influence of the tails of the emitted waves on radiation reaction in the binary ( sec .  [ inspiralwaveforms ] ) , the lens - thirring orbital precision induced by the binary s spins ( sec .  [ inspiralwaveforms ] ) , and a unique relationship among the multipole moments of a quiescent black hole which is dictated by a hole s `` two - hair theorem '' ( sec .  [ lfbhinspiral ] ) .",
    "the ultimate test of general relativity will be detailed comparisons of the predicted and observed waveforms from the highly nonlinear spacetime - warpage vibrations of bh / bh mergers ( sec .",
    "[ bhbhinspmergring ] ) .",
    "binary inspiral waves can be used to measure the universe s hubble constant , deceleration parameter , and cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the keys to such measurements are that : ( i ) advanced interferometers in ligo / virgo will be able to see ns / ns inspirals out to cosmological redshifts @xmath204 , and ns / bh out to @xmath205 .",
    "( ii ) the direct observables that can be extracted from the observed waveforms include a source s luminosity distance ( measured to an accuracy @xmath93 per cent in a large fraction of cases ) , and its direction on the sky ( to accuracy @xmath38 square degree)accuracies good enough that only one or a few electromagnetically - observed clusters of galaxies should fall within the 3-dimensional gravitational error boxes .",
    "this should make possible joint gravitational / electromagnetic statistical studies of our universe s magnitude - redshift relation , with gravity giving luminosity distances and electromagnetism giving the redshifts @xcite .",
    "( iii ) another direct gravitational observable is any redshifted mass @xmath185 in the system . since the masses of ns s in binaries seem to cluster around @xmath206 , measurements of @xmath185 can provide a handle on the redshift , even in the absence of electromagnetic aid ; so gravitational - wave observations alone may be used , in a statistical way , to measure the magnitude - redshift relation @xcite .",
    "lisa , with its ability to detect bh / bh binaries with @xmath5 to @xmath207 out to redshifts of thousands , could search for the earliest epochs of supermassive black hole activity  if the universe is kind enough to grant us a large event rate .",
    "ryan @xcite has shown that , when a white dwarf , neutron star or small black hole spirals into a much more massive , compact central body , the inspiral waves will carry a `` map '' of the massive body s external spacetime geometry . since the body s spacetime geometry is uniquely characterized by the values of the body s multiple moments , we can say equivalently that the inspiral waves carry , encoded in themselves , the values of all the body s multipole moments .    by measuring the inspiral waveforms and extracting their map ( i.e. , measuring the lowest few multipole moments )",
    ", we can determine whether the massive central body is a black hole or some other kind of exotic compact object @xcite ; see below .",
    "the inspiraling object s orbital energy @xmath208 at fixed frequency @xmath59 ( and correspondingly at fixed orbital radius @xmath209 ) scales as @xmath210 , where @xmath159 is the object s mass ; the gravitational - wave luminosity @xmath211 scales as @xmath212 ; and the time to final merger thus scales as @xmath213 .",
    "this means that the smaller is @xmath214 ( where @xmath21 is the central body s mass ) , the more orbits are spent in the central body s strong - gravity region , @xmath215 , and thus the more detailed and accurate will be the map of the body s spacetime geometry encoded in the emitted waves .    for holes observed by ligo / virgo ,",
    "the most extreme mass ratio that we can hope for is @xmath216 , since for @xmath217 the inspiral waves are pushed to frequencies below the ligo / virgo band .",
    "this limit on @xmath214 seriously constrains the accuracy with which ligo / virgo can hope to map the spacetime geometry .",
    "a detailed study by ryan @xcite ( but one that is rather approximate because we do not know the full details of the waveforms ) suggests that ligo / virgo might _ not _ be able to distinguish cleanly between quiescent black holes and other types of massive central bodies .",
    "by contrast , lisa can observe the final inspiral waves from objects of any mass @xmath218 spiraling into central bodies of mass @xmath219 out to 3gpc .",
    "figure [ fig : lisa_noise ] shows the example of a @xmath220 black hole spiraling into a @xmath221 black hole at 3gpc distance .",
    "the inspiral orbit and waves are strongly influenced by the hole s spin .",
    "two cases are shown @xcite : an inspiraling circular orbit around a non - spinning hole , and a prograde , circular , equatorial orbit around a maximally spinning hole . in each case",
    "the dot at the upper left end of the arrowed curve is the frequency and characteristic amplitude one year before the final coalescence . in the nonspinning case",
    ", the small hole spends its last year spiraling inward from @xmath222 ( 3.7 schwarzschild radii ) to its last stable circular orbit at @xmath223 ( 3 schwarzschild radii ) . in the maximal spin case , the last year is spent traveling from @xmath223 ( 3 schwarzschild radii ) to the last stable orbit at @xmath224 ( half a schwarzschild radius ) .",
    "the @xmath225 cycles of waves during this last year should carry , encoded in themselves , rather accurate values for the massive hole s lowest few multipole moments @xcite ( or , equivalently , a rather accurate map of the hole s spacetime geometry ) .",
    "if the measured moments satisfy the black - hole `` two - hair '' theorem ( usually incorrectly called the `` no - hair '' theorem ) , i.e.   if they are all determined uniquely by the measured mass and spin in the manner of the kerr metric , then we can be sure the central body is a black hole .",
    "if they violate the two - hair theorem , then ( assuming general relativity is correct ) , either the central body was an exotic object  e.g . a spinning boson star which should have three `` hairs '' @xcite ,",
    "a soliton star @xcite or a naked singularity  rather than a black hole , or else an accretion disk or other material was perturbing its orbit @xcite . from the evolution of the waves one can hope to determine which is the case , and to explore the properties of the central body and its environment @xcite .",
    "models of galactic nuclei , where massive holes ( or other massive central bodies ) reside , suggest that inspiraling stars and small holes typically will be in rather eccentric orbits @xcite .",
    "this is because they get injected into such orbits via gravitational deflections off other stars , and by the time gravitational radiation reaction becomes the dominant orbital driving force , there is not enough inspiral left to strongly circularize their orbits .",
    "such orbital eccentricity will complicate the waveforms and complicate the extraction of information from them .",
    "efforts to understand the emitted waveforms , for central bodies with arbitrary multipole moments , are just now getting underway @xcite . even for central black holes ,",
    "those efforts are at an early stage ; for example , only recently have we learned how to compute the influence of radiation reaction on inspiraling objects in fully relativistic , nonequatorial orbits around a black hole @xcite .",
    "the event rates for inspiral into supermassive black holes ( or other supermassive central bodies ) are not well understood . however , since a significant fraction of all galactic nuclei are thought to contain supermassive holes , and since white dwarfs and neutron stars , as well as small black holes , can withstand tidal disruption as they plunge toward a supermassive hole s horizon , and since lisa can see inspiraling bodies as small as @xmath226 out to 3gpc distance , the event rate is likely to be interestingly large .",
    "sigurdsson and rees give a `` very conservative '' estimate of one inspiral event per year within 1gpc distance , and 1001000 sources detectable by lisa at lower frequencies `` en route '' toward their final plunge .",
    "it is now 37 years since joseph weber initiated his pioneering development of gravitational - wave detectors @xcite , 26 years since robert forward @xcite and rainer weiss @xcite initiated work on interferometric detectors , and about 35 years since chandra and others launched the modern era of theoretical research on relativistic stars and black holes .",
    "since then , hundreds of talented experimental physicists have struggled to improve the sensitivities of gravitational - wave detectors , and hundreds of theorists have explored general relativity s predictions for stars and black holes .",
    "these two parallel efforts are now intimately intertwined and are pushing toward an era in the not distant future , when measured gravitational waveforms will be compared with theoretical predictions to learn how many and what kinds of relativistic objects _ really _ populate our universe , and how these relativistic objects _ really _ are structured and _ really _ behave when quiescent , when vibrating , and when colliding .",
    "my group s research on gravitational waves and their relevance to ligo / virgo and lisa is supported in part by nsf grants ast-9417371 and phy-9424337 and by nasa grant nagw-4268/nag5 - 4351 .",
