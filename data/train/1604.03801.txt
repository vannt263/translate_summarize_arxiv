    "l1527 irs is a class 0 protostar , at a distance of @xmath1140 pc , in its earliest stages of formation .",
    "it has a mass of @xmath10.2 solar masses and is surrounded by a flared rotating envelope of about one solar mass , as recently reported by @xcite who observed it in the continuum ( at 1.3 and 3.4 mm wavelength ) and on the @xmath9co(2 - 1 ) line using the submillimeter array ( sma ) and the combined array for research in millimeter astronomy ( carma ) .",
    "these observations suggest a mass accretion rate of and a disc diameter at the arcsecond scale .",
    "they were followed by measurements and analyses of the 1.3 mm dust polarization by @xcite and @xcite , which reveal a toroidal magnetic field configuration .",
    "alma observations of molecular lines have been reported very recently : of c@xmath0o and so by @xcite , of cyclic - c@xmath10h@xmath11 and so by @xcite and of cch , cs , h@xmath11co and ch@xmath10oh by @xcite .",
    "all above observations establish the presence of in - falling cool gas ( t@xmath130 k ) onto a rotating disc surrounding the protostar and having its axis close to the east - west direction , here taken as @xmath12 axis .",
    "surprisingly , they have also revealed major differences between the responses of so , h@xmath11co and ch@xmath10oh and those of co , cch , cs and cyclic - c@xmath10h@xmath11 : the latter display double - peaked doppler velocity distributions while the former display single peaks .",
    "this is interpreted by the authors as evidence for different molecules populating different radial regions , the former being confined to the inner part of the envelope , close to the disc , and absent from the foreground gas , while the latter are distributed over the foreground gas and subject to absorption .",
    "the in - falling motion of the foreground gas explains the small red - shift of the observed absorption dip .",
    "the presence of a keplerian disc having a diameter at the arcsecond scale is generally accepted , the rotation velocity of the envelope decreasing faster at larger distances .",
    "the mechanism governing the disc dynamics , in particular the relative roles of magnetohydrodynamic turbulences and of self - gravitation are still unclear ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "the above mentioned very recent observations follow a long series of earlier observations that have established the presence of an outflow along the east - west direction , with an opening angle of some 40@xmath8 @xcite and tilted eastward by some 10@xmath8 from north .",
    "we refer the reader to the abundant literature quoted in the recent publications in the reference list attached to the present article . in",
    "what follows , we produce a simple model of the gas envelope that relies exclusively on its morphologic and kinematic properties , without reference to what is causing the strong absorption detected above systemic velocity .",
    "this is at variance with earlier models and contributes significant new information to the understanding of the underlying accretion mechanism .",
    "the observations used in the present article were made in cycle 1 of alma operation on july 20 , 2014 .",
    "the time spent on source was 36 minutes .",
    "the number of antennas was 35 for part of the time , 36 otherwise , the longest baseline being 783.5 m ; the two sets of data have been merged and reduced by the alma staff .",
    "the systemic velocity used as origin of the doppler velocity scale is .",
    "the maps of the c@xmath0o(2 - 1 ) line emission are centred on the maximum of the continuum emission with right ascension of and declination of .",
    "the synthetized beam size ( fwhm ) is 0.6 @xmath13 0.5 arcsec@xmath14 with a @xmath15 position angle from north .",
    "these data have a better spatial resolution but are otherwise similar to the cycle 0 observations used by @xcite .",
    "pixels are 0.15 @xmath13 0.15 arcsec@xmath14 and the velocity bins are 0.16 kms@xmath3 wide . the data used in the present work are limited to a region in the plane of the sky covering 17 pixels in @xmath12 and 57 pixels in @xmath16 , namely 2.55 and 8.55 arcsec respectively , over which a significant signal can be reliably detected . in practice",
    "we limit the analysis to distances of the order of 4 arcsec where filtering out at large distances is not significant , the minimum baselines being essentially the same here and in the observations used by @xcite .",
    "we use orthonormal coordinates with @xmath17 along the line of sight , @xmath12 and @xmath16 in the plane of the sky , @xmath12 pointing east and @xmath16 pointing north . throughout the article we assume a distance of 140 pc from the sun , implying that an angular distance of 1 arcsec corresponds to an actual distance of 140 au in the plane of the sky .",
    "accordingly , we use indifferently arcsec or au to measure distances , including along the line of sight .    as mentioned earlier ,",
    "the continuum data are only used to define the origin of coordinates .",
    "indeed , gaussian fits to the @xmath12 and @xmath16 distributions of the continuum flux give full widths at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 0.47 and 0.71 arcsec respectively with the same beam size as for the line data : the source is unresolved in @xmath12 and has a size at the scale of @xmath10.4 arcsec in @xmath16 , consistent with the size of the disc .",
    "the map of the line flux integrated over doppler velocities , @xmath18 , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] together with its projections on the @xmath12 and @xmath16 axes .",
    "the projected distributions are shown together with their reflections with respect to the origin , demonstrating the good agreement between the centres of the continuum and line maps .",
    "a small north - south asymmetry is visible on the @xmath16 distribution , the southern flux exceeding the northern flux by some 10% below 1 arcsec and by an average of @xmath120% between 1 and 4 arcsec .",
    "however , this asymmetry is real and not the result of an offset centre .",
    "we evaluated the position and width of the effective noise , meaning the peak observed at low values in the distribution of the flux density , in each velocity bin separately . in the low velocity bins where the signal is large enough to significantly contribute to nearly all pixels",
    ", we extrapolated from the values taken in pixels outside the restricted map used in the analysis .",
    "the rms value of the peak varies between 3 and 5 and the offsets between 0 and 5 depending on the intensity of the integrated signal measured in the bin . to each flux density measurement",
    "we attach an uncertainty obtained by adding in quadrature the rms of the effective noise and half the value of the offset , the value of the flux density being corrected for the offset .",
    "we normally retain for the analysis , unless specified otherwise , flux densities exceeding twice the uncertainty ( we speak of a 2-@xmath19 cut ) . figure  [ fig2 ] displays the distributions of the ratio of the flux densities and their associated uncertainties both inside and outside a central rectangle covering 0.8 @xmath13 1.2 arcsec@xmath14 in @xmath20 . in the central region , nearly each pixel has a significant content .",
    "as well known from previous studies , the envelope of l1527 is seen edge - on and its axis is oriented east - west , namely along the @xmath12 axis . in practice ,",
    "the approximate symmetry plane of the envelope ( referred to as the `` disc plane '' for simplicity ) may slightly differ from the ( @xmath21 ) plane",
    ". a rotation about the line of sight ( @xmath17 axis ) would be immediately visible on the sky map as an angle @xmath22 between its approximate symmetry axis and the @xmath16 axis .",
    "a rotation about the @xmath16 axis by an angle @xmath23 is more difficult to reveal and must be obtained from the east - west extension of the measured integrated flux along the @xmath12 direction , which however combines the effect of @xmath23 with those of the beam size and of the intrinsic disk thickness .",
    "@xcite using l band imaging from the gemini north telescope , quote a value of 5@xmath8 for each of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the present data , we find that @xmath22 does not exceed a degree ( fig .  [ fig3 ] left ) when @xmath24 is limited to 3 arcsec but beyond @xmath24 @xmath13 arcsec , deviations reaching @xmath10.4 arcsec in @xmath12",
    "are observed , eastward in the southern hemisphere and westward in the northern hemisphere , corresponding to a counter - clockwise tilt at the 10@xmath8 scale visible in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( left ) .",
    "the evaluation of the angle @xmath23 is obtained from figure  [ fig3 ] ( right ) , which displays the @xmath12 distribution of @xmath18 for @xmath25 for different values of @xmath26 . in the central region ,",
    "its fwhm is 0.85 arcsec , compared with 0.47 arcsec for the continuum , meaning @xmath10.70 arcsec after beam deconvolution .",
    "the fwhm of the @xmath16 distribution is @xmath27 arcsec , meaning @xmath28 arcsec in reality : we may place an upper limit of @xmath29 on the value of @xmath23 . in the following",
    "we shall usually work in the approximation where both @xmath22 and @xmath23 cancel .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] displays the distribution of the flux density on the doppler velocity @xmath30 and the sky map of its mean .",
    "the dominant feature of the map is the north - south anti - symmetry revealing the well - known rotation of the envelope about the @xmath12 axis .",
    "closer inspection reveals another significant asymmetry : blue - shifted emission is shifted westward and red - shifted emission eastward ( namely having the same inclination with respect to the @xmath16 axis as the flux excesses noted above for @xmath31 arcsec ) ; this is further illustrated in the lower right panel of the figure , displaying the dependence on @xmath16 of the mean value of @xmath12 weighted by the mean doppler velocity in each pixel .",
    "a linear fit gives a slope of @xmath320.17 , corresponding to a tilt of @xmath33 east of north .",
    "namely , while the `` disc planes '' defined by the symmetry of the intensity ( figure  [ fig3 ] right ) or of the doppler velocity ( figure  [ fig4 ] lower right ) are both centred at the origin to within one pixel , they differ by about @xmath34 in terms of their inclination ( @xmath22 ) with respect to the ( @xmath21 ) plane .",
    "however , the latter ( using velocity ) matches the tilt of the former ( using intensity ) observed at @xmath31 arcsec and mentioned in sub - section 3.1 .",
    "the doppler velocity spectrum is split in two by a central dip giving evidence for the major role played by absorption in these observations . indeed",
    ", an optically thin disc of cool gas could not display such a dip .",
    "two explanations have been invoked in earlier publications : absorption of the continuum emission by the foreground gas , extending typically over @xmath35 arcsec in @xmath16 and slightly red - shifted because of the in - fall contribution to the velocity of the foreground gas ; and absorption of the envelope emission by the foreground gas . as the dip is seen both inside and outside the continuum region ( figure  [ fig4 ] upper right )",
    ", absorption can not be exclusively blamed on the continuum and an important contribution of extended foreground gas , not only of the envelope , is to be expected @xcite . while the cool outer envelope , meaning @xmath24>@xmath10.6 arcsec ,",
    "is expected to be optically thin at the scale of the present observations , it is seen behind an extended cloud that covers the full map and causes the presence of a dip in the velocity spectrum , again slightly red - shifted because of the average in - falling velocity of the foreground cloud , and extending over the whole @xmath16 range",
    ".    a closer look at the dependence of @xmath30 on the location of the source is given in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , displaying position - velocity diagrams , with the doppler velocity as abscissa .",
    "the ordinate is one of the sky coordinates and each diagram covers a specified interval of the other coordinate . to first order , they are characteristic of a rotating envelope having its axis along the @xmath12 axis and displaying symmetries in @xmath12 ( changing @xmath12 in @xmath36 leaves both doppler velocity and flux densities invariant ) and in @xmath16 ( changing @xmath16 in @xmath37 changes the sign of the doppler velocity and leaves the flux density invariant ) .",
    "but they also reveal the effects of absorption mentioned above : the absence of emission in the two velocity bins above systemic velocity , namely @xmath38 kms@xmath3 , is ubiquitous . to further illustrate this point",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] doppler velocity spectra averaged over @xmath39 arcsec and different intervals of @xmath24 .",
    "absorption is confined to low velocities , slightly red - shifted .",
    "if symmetry in @xmath16 is obeyed , the velocity spectra measured at two opposite values of @xmath16 are related by reflection about the origin .",
    "this is made clear in the figure by comparing the direct spectrum in the northern hemisphere with the reflected spectrum in the southern hemisphere .",
    "if symmetry were obeyed , they would be identical .",
    "however , absorption being red - shifted breaks the symmetry : it suppresses the red - shifted part of the direct spectrum and the blue - shifted part of the reflected spectrum , as is clearly observed on the figure .    in what follows we use this feature to select data that are not too strongly affected by absorption . at variance with earlier studies",
    "@xcite we prefer not to rely on a description of the absorption mechanism , which we would find difficult to model reliably .",
    "adopting such an approach , a detailed study of the spectra displayed in figure  [ fig6 ] shows that four velocity bins , covering the interval between @xmath320.16 and 0.48 kms@xmath3 are essentially lost for analysis .",
    "however , if one assumes symmetry under both @xmath12 and @xmath16 reflections about the origin , namely invariance of the flux density under transformations of @xmath40 into @xmath41 and @xmath42 , the number of lost velocity bins can be reduced to two by retaining the blue - shifted part of the direct spectra and the red - shifted part of the reflected spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , applying small corrections on the neighbouring bins .",
    "this feature is being made use of in the following section .",
    "figure  [ fig7 ] ( right ) displays the dependence of the integrated flux over position angle within an elliptic ring surrounding the star as shown in the left panel .",
    "more precisely , we use as abscissa @xmath43 which is simply related to the position angle @xmath44 .",
    "the right panel gives direct evidence for the @xmath6 shape of the flared envelope at large distances visible in the left panel .",
    "the in - falling flux is enhanced within @xmath45 in @xmath46 from the @xmath16 axis , meaning within @xmath47 in @xmath48 .",
    "this direct evidence for an enhancement of the in - falling flux at intermediate values of @xmath48 , or equivalently of a depression of the in - falling flux in the neighbourhood of the disc plane , will be confirmed and discussed in the following sections .",
    "we now use the information obtained in the preceding section to produce a simple model of the gas envelope .",
    "we assume perfect symmetry in both @xmath12 and @xmath16 and rotation invariance about the @xmath12 axis . the preceding section has shown that these are reasonable approximations and has given quantitative evaluations of the amount by which the data deviate from such an ideal situation .",
    "moreover , we do not attempt fitting the density and temperature distributions separately ; instead we absorb them in a single quantity , the effective emissivity @xmath49 , defined such that @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the measured flux density and where the @xmath17 axis is parallel to the line of sight while the @xmath12 and @xmath16 axes point east and north respectively .",
    "the justification for considering the effective emissivity rather than the temperature and the actual density is twofold : first , having data on a single co line , we have no simple access to the temperature and second , the important absorption near systemic velocity , which cuts away from analysis a significant fraction of the data , would require a detailed knowledge of the morphology and kinematics of the cloud in which the source is embedded as well as a detailed description of the continuum source , both of which are out of reach .",
    "as the c@xmath0o component is expected to be optically thin , it remains reasonable to assume axisymmetry of the effective emissivity .",
    "the symmetries of the model imply that we may symmetrize the data , averaging flux densities @xmath51 and @xmath52 as well as @xmath51 and @xmath53 .",
    "the latter average implies accounting for the slight red - shift of the dip as explained in the preceding section . in practice ,",
    "two velocity bins are excluded from the analysis , , and the contents of the neighbour bins are corrected , the uncertainty attached to each measurement being increased accordingly .",
    "the flux densities are evaluated by integration along the line of sight up to 7 arcsec ( meaning @xmath11000 au ) in @xmath17 and distributed among the pixels using a gaussian beam profile in both @xmath12 and @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath54 is evaluated using as uncertainties the sum in quadrature of the above mentioned uncertainties and 10% of the measured flux density .",
    "we have checked that different reasonable choices essentially lead to the same results as presented below .",
    "we have paid much attention at introducing as small as possible a number of parameters to describe the morphology and kinematics of the gas volume . to allow the reader who is not interested in details to jump directly to the end of the section ( sub - section 4.3 ) we describe them briefly in the present paragraph .",
    "guided by elementary hydrodynamics considerations , implying a smooth transition from flared disc to centrally symmetric in - fall , we describe the flux as spiralling on paraboloids having as axis the symmetry axis .",
    "a parameter @xmath55 is used to describe their shape and a scaling parameter @xmath56 to label them ( increasing for paraboloids becoming less open and more distant from the origin ) .",
    "the total velocity is tangent to the relevant paraboloid and is the sum of a rotation component , normal to the axis , and an in - fall component , contained in the meridian plane ( @xmath57 ) with @xmath58 pointing along a radius of the disc .",
    "the scale of the former is given by a single parameter @xmath59 and its radial dependence by a power law index going from @xmath321 at infinity to @xmath60 at short distances , the transition being defined by a single parameter , @xmath61 .",
    "the scale of the latter is given by a single parameter @xmath62 and its radial dependence by a power law index going to @xmath63 at large distances and becoming larger at smaller distances as governed by a second parameter @xmath64 .",
    "in practice , we find that both @xmath65 and @xmath64 are very poorly defined and that the data are satisfied with a nearly constant in - fall velocity",
    ". an important result of our analysis is the evidence for a significant depression of the effective emissivity near the disc plane as previously mentioned in section 3.4 . in order to parameterise its shape ,",
    "we need two parameters , @xmath66 measuring its extension around the disc plane and @xmath67 measuring its scale .",
    "the stationary isothermal regime that can be described by the above parameters is used here as a reference , but is obviously improper to describe reality .",
    "an additional parameter @xmath68 is introduced to measure the deviation of the flux from such an ideal regime .",
    "a last parameter @xmath69 describes the observed dependence of the rotation velocity when moving away from the ( @xmath21 ) plane ( figure  [ fig5 ] lower left ) .    in total",
    ", the model uses eleven parameters in addition to the scale factor @xmath70 readily obtained by normalisation of the integrated flux predicted by the model to the measured flux . of these eleven parameters , two , @xmath65 and @xmath64 turnout",
    "to be so poorly constrained that they could as well be omitted and one , @xmath69 , is trivially obtained from the data .",
    "we are therefore dealing effectively with a 8-parameter model to describe the morphology and kinematics of the envelope .",
    "we model ( fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] ) the trajectories of the gas molecules as spiralling on paraboloids of equation with the cylindrical radius ( note that the choice of 3 arcsec in the denominator is arbitrary ) .",
    "the velocity is parameterised as the sum of a component @xmath71 perpendicular to the ( @xmath58,@xmath12 ) plane and a velocity @xmath72 tangent to the parabola in the ( @xmath58,@xmath12 ) plane .",
    "if @xmath73 is the angle between the ( @xmath58,@xmath12 ) plane and the plane of the sky , the component of @xmath71 on @xmath17 is @xmath74 .",
    "the unit vector tangent to the parabola has components @xmath75 on @xmath12 and @xmath76 on @xmath58 with @xmath77^{-\\sfrac{1}{2}}$ ] .",
    "the component of @xmath72 on @xmath17 is @xmath78 .",
    "hence @xmath79 our hypothesis of rotational invariance implies that the morphology and kinematics of the envelope are independent of @xmath80 .",
    "we parameterise both @xmath71 and @xmath72 as functions of the distance to the origin , .",
    "the rotation velocity is known to evolve from an inverse distance law at large distances from the protostar to keplerian at short distances @xcite , which we translate as a power law in @xmath4 of index @xmath81 , giving @xmath82 at @xmath83 and @xmath84 at @xmath85 with @xmath61 measuring the distance from the protostar at which the transition takes place .",
    "moreover , we allow for a small decrease of the rotation velocity when moving away from the @xmath86 plane ( @xmath12=0 ) as seen in the lower left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and we write @xmath87",
    ".    the velocity @xmath72 must cancel when approaching the disc and behave as a power law at large distances , which we write as @xmath88 reaching its maximum at @xmath89 and behaving as @xmath90 at large distances .",
    "note that at variance with earlier models @xcite our evaluation of the in - fall velocity rests exclusively on the kinematics of the envelope , without any constraint from the absorption .",
    "we parameterise the density @xmath91 as a multiple of the density @xmath92 associated with a constant accretion rate @xmath93 in a stationary regime . at a distance @xmath58 from the @xmath12 axis , the mass of gas flowing in a time @xmath94 across @xmath58 between paraboloids @xmath95 and @xmath96 is @xmath97.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to parameterise @xmath98 , we remark that it must decrease rapidly when @xmath95 increases in order to leave room for the broad outflow about the @xmath12 axis .",

    "it is to be seen in conjunction with the important deviation from zero measured for @xmath68 , 0.93@xmath20.25 , illustrating the approximate nature of the assumptions made in constructing and/or interpreting the model ( no viscosity , stationarity , no turbulences , thermal equilibrium , optical thinness , etc . ) . in particular , a non - zero value of @xmath68 is straightforwardly generated by variations of the temperature with @xmath4",
    "this suggests , rather than comparing kinetic energy with potential energy , to compare instead their variations with @xmath4 . writing that the kinetic energy increase is compensated by an equal decrease of the gravitational potential energy at @xmath4=1.5 arcsec",
    ", we find a value of @xmath115 0.7/0.5 times larger than previously obtained , namely @xmath10.3 solar masses .",
    "the very approximate nature of these evaluations must be kept in mind and we retain an estimate of 0.23@xmath20.06 solar masses contained within @xmath1121.5 arcsec , where the uncertainty is meant to account for systematic contributions .",
    "possible mechanisms causing the in - fall velocity to be significantly smaller than the free - fall velocity have been reviewed in the earlier literature .",
    "they do not need to be repeated here as the present analysis does not provide new arguments that could favour one of these over the others .      the dependence on @xmath95 of the accretion rate is accurately measured and could as well have been modelled by a gaussian enhancement in @xmath95 having a mean value of @xmath120=0.156 and a @xmath19 of 0.088 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] left ) .",
    "there is clear evidence for a strong depression in the disc plane as well as over a broad solid angle about the disc axis where outflow is known to take place .",
    "we prefer to talk of a depression in the disc plane rather than an @xmath6-shaped enhancement because simple gravity requires the density to increase toward the disc plane .",
    "the geometry of the observed depression makes it very unlikely that it be the result of an artefact of the model or of opacity .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that it reveals an actual depression of the co(2 - 1 ) emission .",
    "as well - known ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) the proximity of the gas temperature to the co sublimation temperature implies that freeze - out of co molecules on cold dust grains - or conversely sublimation - is a dominant process in the dynamics that govern the evolution of gas envelopes .",
    "many astrochemical models predict a protoplanetary disc structure similar to what is found here ( for a recent example see * ? ? ?",
    "another example of the importance of the role played by co freeze - out on ( or sublimation from ) dust grains is a recent study @xcite suggesting that protostars such as l1527 undergo significant bursts once every 20000 years causing sublimation of the frozen - out co molecules .",
    "this suggests an interpretation of the observed depression in terms of co molecules freezing out on cold dust preferably near the median disc plane .",
    "ultimately ( see figure 14 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) this is indeed what is expected and it is not unreasonable to assume that it is starting to take place in the case of l1527 .",
    "the normalisation between the effective emissivity obtained in the model and observed in the data , fixing @xmath70 , gives an evaluation of the accretion rate of 3.5 10@xmath7 m@xmath5yr@xmath3 , where we assume a constant temperature of 30 k and a c@xmath0o to molecular hydrogen ratio of 4.9 10@xmath121 @xcite .",
    "this number is evaluated at a distance of 1 arcsec from the star",
    ". a significantly higher accretion rate of 6.6 10@xmath7 m@xmath5yr@xmath3was suggested by @xcite using luminosity arguments .",
    "however , this evaluation is very indirect and the uncertainty attached to it is large . rather than being a cause of concern",
    ", the fact that the two numbers differ by a factor of nearly 2 suggests that the associated methods measure different quantities that are subject to very different systematic uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the evaluation obtained from the present analysis depends on the distance from the star , decreasing by a factor @xmath122 when moving away to a distance of 2 arcsec . taking this into account",
    ", we retain a value of 3.5@xmath21.0 10@xmath7 m@xmath5yr@xmath3at a distance of 1 arcsec ( 140 au ) from the star .",
    "the envelope thickness at @xmath16=0 , measured by a fwhm of @xmath10.55 in @xmath95 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] left ) meaning @xmath10.7 arcsec , is consistent with the value quoted in sub - section 3.1 from which an upper limit of @xmath123 was placed on a possible tilt @xmath23 between the disc plane and the @xmath86 plane about the @xmath16 axis .",
    "the observed @xmath124 tilt @xmath22 about the @xmath17 axis of the map of @xmath125 that was mentioned in sub - section 3.2 and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] deserves some comments .",
    "as remarked then , such a tilt is also seen in the integrated flux for distances from the star exceeding @xmath13 arcsec , not only in the present data ( figures  [ fig1 ] left and  [ fig3 ] left ) , but also in infrared observations @xcite .",
    "the difference of inclination of the central part of the envelope , as measured from the integrated flux , and of the outer part , including the outflow , is not due to some trivial geometric effect but is real .",
    "many factors may play a role in this context , such as magnetic field ( see for example the review of * ? ? ? * ) or binarity @xcite .",
    "in summary , the main original contribution of the present analysis to our understanding of the formation process of l1527 is the presentation of a simple 3d parameterisation of the morphology and kinematics of the gas envelope based solely on the observation of the c@xmath0o ( 2 - 1 ) line emission from regions that are not dominated by absorption . in the explored range , the model , which uses eight relevant parameters , reproduces observations significantly better than earlier attempts .",
    "this was made possible by assuming central symmetry and axisymmetry about the @xmath12 ( west - east ) axis and by excluding from the analysis doppler velocities between 0 and 0.32 kms@xmath3and a band of the sky map of @xmath20.675 arcsec about the @xmath12 axis .",
    "moreover we have reduced the radial dependences of the temperature and density to a single quantity , the effective emissivity .",
    "we have presented arguments showing that such assumptions are indeed reasonable .",
    "the main conclusions of the analysis are : + a ) _ rotation _ : the model uses successfully trajectories spiralling down toward the disc on paraboloids coaxial with it . we give evidence for the dominance of rotation over the explored range and confirm that the rotation curve is as expected from a transition from an inverse distance law to a keplerian regime .",
    "the rotation velocity decreases from @xmath11.66 kms@xmath3to @xmath10.34 kms@xmath3when @xmath4 increases from 1 to 5 arcsec .",
    "however , the range explored is too distant from the star to allow direct observation of the disc .",
    "+ b ) _ in - fall velocity _ : we measure a mean in - fall velocity of 0.43@xmath20.10 kms@xmath3over the explored range , smaller than free fall velocity , with no evidence for a significant @xmath4-dependence , in particular no evidence for the sudden jump to @xmath11.5 kms@xmath3required by @xcite to describe the absorption - dominated central region .",
    "+ c ) _ central mass _ : using simple arguments of energy conservation we evaluate a central mass of 0.23@xmath20.06 solar masses contained within a distance of 1.5 arcsec from the star , in agreement with earlier estimates obtained from a different range of distances @xcite .",
    "we discuss the systematic uncertainty attached to the fact that the in - fall velocity is increasingly smaller than the free - fall velocity when getting closer to the star .",
    "+ d ) _ disc plane depression _ : in addition to a strong depression of the in - falling flux about the disc axis , where outflow is known to be present , we observe a similar depression in the neighbourhood of the disc plane , resulting in an @xmath6 shaped flow directly visible on the data .",
    "we argue that it is not an effect of opacity and suggest that it be caused by the freeze - out of co molecules on cold dust grains occuring preferably near the disc plane .",
    "+ e ) _ accretion rate _ : we measure a value of @xmath126 m@xmath5yr@xmath3at a distance of 1 arcsec ( 140 au ) from the star , however subject to systematic uncertainties again associated with the deviation from a stationary flow , in relation with the deviation of the in - fall velocity from free fall .",
    "this is a factor of nearly 2 smaller than obtained by @xcite from luminosity arguments .",
    "however , we argue that the apparent disagreement should be understood as evidence for the two evaluations actually measuring different quantities .",
    "+ f ) _ orientation in space _ : we give an upper limit of @xmath1@xmath127 on a possible tilt of the disc plane about the south - north ( @xmath16 ) axis . a tilt of @xmath1@xmath34 about the line of sight ( @xmath17 axis )",
    "is observed at large distances ( @xmath1283 arcsec ) , matching earlier infrared observations @xcite , but cancels at smaller distances .",
    "a same tilt of @xmath34 is observed on the map of the mean doppler velocity .",
