    "when an impure white dwarf ( wd ) or neutron star crust ( nsc ) is slowly cooled from above its melting temperature , one expects the extra compositional degrees of freedom are taken advantage of to form crystals which are more efficiently packed than phase - separated bcc lattices .",
    "indeed , several investigators have considered non - bravais and multicomponent lattices as the possible ground state of astrophysical compact objects .",
    "one of the earliest was @xcite , who suggested a rock salt structure of fe and he nuclei might be stable .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied cesium - chloride and magnesium - diboride structures within the coulomb crystal model . @xcite",
    "have argued that the ground state structure above neutron drip density may be similar to that of the displacive ferroelectric batio@xmath1 , due to the symmetry - lowering effect of interstitial neutrons on a bcc lattice of nuclei",
    ". a related line of inquiry concerns the freezing of multicomponent ion plasmas from the liquid state .",
    "see @xcite for a semi - analytic calculation and references to earlier numerical methods .",
    "one such method  classical molecular dynamics  has been used extensively to simulate a multicomponent plasma with the @xcite composition @xcite .",
    "the latter of these works features a 14-component , @xmath228,000 particle system which was annealed for @xmath3@xmath4 phonon cycles below the melting temperature . a dominantly se ( @xmath5=34 ) bcc lattice was formed , with small-@xmath5 nuclei occupying interstitial positions and larger-@xmath5 nuclei acting as substitutional impurities . in addition",
    ", there was a tendency for small-@xmath5 nuclei to cluster together , forming an effective large-@xmath5 particle . in a different simulation",
    "where annealing was again carried out for @xmath3@xmath4 phonon cycles @xcite , phase - separated regions ( microcrystals ) formed in the solid phase .",
    "one phase was depleted in small-@xmath5 nuclei , while another was enriched .",
    "simulated annealing is an excellent means for directly modeling the dynamics of crystalline systems , but it often can not access the very long timescales associated with the nucleation and growth of complex multicomponent crystal phases , due to the exponentially slow dynamics of surmounting reaction barriers against the complex cooperative rearrangements needed to form such crystals . for example , terrestrial carbon steels , which typically have only 23 alloying elements , must be annealed for a minimum of @xmath3@xmath6 phonon cycles ( @xmath310 seconds ) to find their ground state @xcite .",
    "alternative methods including random structure searching @xcite , particle swarm optimization @xcite , and genetic / evolutionary search techniques @xcite have been applied with great success to this  crystal structure problem , \" but have not yet been applied at the extreme conditions of compact astrophysical objects . when coupled with an appropriate description of the ( fully pressure - ionized ) microphysics , such methods could provide a means to efficiently search for new crystal structures in multicomponent wds and nscs , complementing the existing simulated annealing work .    the existence of lower - symmetry ( i.e. non - cubic ) and/or multinary phases within wds and nscs could have several astrophysical implications .",
    "most astrophysical calculations assume the material is a bcc polycrystal with grain sizes small compared to the other macroscopic physical scales in the problem .",
    "therefore , for example , the rank - four elastic tensor is averaged and smoothed to produce a scalar shear modulus relating the strain response to an applied stress ( one popular averaging procedure is described by @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of multiple , complicated lattice structures , and preferential alignment with e.g. the local magnetic field , would necessitate computing the full elastic tensor .",
    "anisotropies , soft phonon modes , and elastic instabilities such as the incipient ones described in @xcite could have significant effects on elasticity - related astrophysical observables such as magnetar flares @xcite , related quasi - periodic oscillations @xcite , and possibly some pulsar glitches @xcite .",
    "it could also significantly affect the future observability of gravitational - wave emission , both in the context of magnetar flares and continuous waves @xcite .",
    "grain / phase domain boundaries would lead to preferred stress - failure locations , and on large scales might affect dissipation of modes involving the crust such as torsion or shear modes ( @xcite , used to explain quasi - periodic oscillations after magnetar flares ) and @xmath7-modes ( similar to the  crust freezing \" scenario in @xcite ) .",
    "these again would have implications both for electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations .",
    "another kind of implication has to do with the composition of wd debris disks and planetary systems , inferred from metal abundances in the accreting wd s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "entering into this calculation is the settling rate of the high-@xmath5 metals . in principle",
    ", this rate depends on the buoyancy of the settling species host phase(s ) as well as the microphysics involved in ordinary grain growth processes , namely interfacial energies and grain boundary mobilities @xcite .    in this work",
    "we carry out a systematic search for the ground state crystal structure of three - component systems at conditions relevant to wds and nscs .",
    "the main goals are 1 ) to identify possible new phases through global search of the multicomponent crystal structure phase diagram , and 2 ) to determine in what contexts those phases might appear in wds and nscs through sample applications to layering stability . to the first end",
    ", we employ a popular genetic search algorithm .",
    "the lowest enthalpy structures found by the genetic search are included in bulk phase diagram calculations , which reveal five new complicated binary and ternary crystal structures , four having sub - cubic lattice symmetry . to the second end , we demonstrate a self - consistent coupling of the phase stability calculation with the basic equations of a self - gravitating , hydrostatically stable white dwarf .",
    "several compositional instances of the newly found binary phases show up as finite thickness  interphases \" between pure bcc strata in cold , he - c - o and c - o - ne white dwarfs .",
    "additional binary phases make a transient appearance in nonequilibrium settling calculations , as host phases for the settling species .",
    "this section describes a global search of composition and structure , using five ternary systems of nuclei thought to be relatively prevalent in wd or nsc matter , and covering a range of distinct  crystal chemistries . \"",
    "the starting point is an effective hamiltonian for completely pressure - ionized matter .",
    "we work within linear response theory  see section v of @xcite , and @xcite , for example . in this framework ,",

    "it is not immediately obvious that the above hamiltonian includes the leading order correction to the kinetic energy @xmath11 of the uniform electron gas ( it does ) .",
    "this can be seen by expanding the kinetic energy in powers of the density nonuniformity correction : @xmath12 and keeping only the first two terms such that a total energy minimization identifies @xmath13 as the static response function of the uniform gas .",
    "equation [ e ] also contains all coulomb interactions except for the infinite nuclear self energies . with a choice of the simple thomas - fermi dielectric function @xmath14 ,",
    "the integrals are standard ones and the hamiltonian reduces to @xmath15 in performing structural optimizations , one converges the energy by working with a supercell of volume @xmath16 and @xmath17 periodic copies thereof .",
    "if @xmath18 is a primitive lattice vector ( supercell translation vector ) and @xmath19 index the basis , the total energy per supercell is written @xmath20 where @xmath21 and the prime on the last sum indicates that terms with @xmath22 are excluded .",

    "@xmath25 is the reduced compton wavelength , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the fine structure constant .",
    "the thomas - fermi description breaks down when the screening length localizes electrons to within their compton wavelength ; this occurs for @xmath29 ( @xmath30 g / cc ) . approaching this extreme relativistic limit",
    ", the ratio of screening length to wigner - seitz radius @xmath31 tends to a constant ( for a bcc lattice of fe nuclei , the constant is 1.82 ) , so we might anticipate that phase boundaries become stationary in this scale - invariant limit .",
    "saturation of @xmath32 at this small value is indicative of the over - screening predicted by the thomas - fermi model . within these constraints",
    "however , the model has the advantage of being both reasonably accurate and computationally efficient , readily incorporated into a global search of crystal structure and composition .",
    "structural optimizations using equations [ etf / n][k0inverse ] are conveniently carried out at constant volume  one need only minimize a pairwise sum of effective yukawa interactions , which converges rapidly in real space for @xmath33 .",
    "the simplicity of this method is conducive to a large basis , useful for studying interfaces , defects and failure mechanisms ( see for example , @xcite ) . because it will prove useful for the phase layering calculation described later , we choose instead to perform structural optimizations at constant external pressure @xmath34 and minimize the enthalpy .",
    "this can be accomplished using a modified version of the general utility lattice program ( gulp ) @xcite , where the yukawa interaction ( available as a special case of the  general \" pair potential ) is given the capability to handle a @xmath16-dependent screening length .",

    "] it is assumed the ground state is a polycrystalline mixture of stoichiometric compounds .",
    "we do nt consider solution ( alloy ) phases , and we consider only a subset of possible stoichiometries . for a given ternary system of nuclei @xmath45-@xmath46-@xmath47 , a constant pressure search is performed at @xmath48 and @xmath49 gpa for each of the nominally 125 stoichiometries @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "search cells with small number of particles @xmath52 are removed from the search program if they are submultiples of larger cells , thus there are 98 searches per ternary system , per pressure .",
    "each of these searches is run out to at least 480 optimized , genetically - operated - on structures , except in the case of single - component searches , which are run out to at least 80 optimized structures ( the first 20 seed structures are randomly generated ) . lattice sums are done in real space with cutoff @xmath53 and are expected to be converged to 78 digits .",
    "this level of accuracy is important , as we find enthalpies of competing structures can be the same out to 6 digits .",
    "default xtalopt search parameters are used throughout , and following the suggestions put forth in the xtalopt implementation paper @xcite , we benchmark the search parameters by constructing hartke plots for several relativistic screened - coulomb systems ( see figure [ fig : hartke ] ) .",
    "hartke plots gauge the performance of a genetic search and help establish a stopping criterion .",
    "our choice of search duration , previously mentioned , is in part motivated by the ",
    "hartke lifetimes \" found in these tests .",
    "the lowest enthalpy structure found in each search is included in a bulk phase stability calculation , using thermo - calc software @xcite . for a given set of @xmath54 state variables (",
    "@xmath55 being the number of components ) thermo - calc finds the global minimum gibbs free energy which lies on a plane tangent to the available phases gibbs energy surfaces .",
    "a phase diagram representable as a 2d plot is then constructed from the set of tangent planes found by varying any two of the state variables .",
    "( for a pedagogical reference to phase diagrams , see the book by @xcite ) .",
    "since all the phases considered in this work are stoichiometric crystal structures , there is a simplification in that the phases gibbs energy surfaces are themselves points .",
    "consequently , all phase regions in a phase diagram obtained by the above procedure must be 3-phase regions .",
    "if a structure appears in the equilibrium phase diagram at either @xmath48 or @xmath49 gpa , it is re - optimized at intermediate pressure decades to obtain the pressure dependence of the phase diagram .",
    "it is possible , though unlikely , that there are phases stable only over a narrow band of pressure which are missed by this procedure ( the full search scheme described in the last paragraph was performed for the c - o - fe system at several intermediate pressures and found no such `` missed '' phases , lending support to this approach ) .",
    "five ternary systems of nuclei were selected for study : he - c - o , c - o - ne , c - o - fe , o - fe - se , and fe - as - se .",
    "( the single exception to the search program described above has to do with he - c - o : our real space method converges much more slowly in this system due to the larger @xmath32 , so the full 98 searches are carried out only at @xmath48 gpa ) .",
    "the first two ternary systems are relevant to wds , likely including those which are type ia supernovae ( snia ) progenitors @xcite",
    ". the third may also be relevant to wds having undergone a failed - detonation snia @xcite .",
    "the rationale for choosing the remaining two is that these particular nuclei are representative and/or prevalent among the @xcite abundances near neutron drip .",
    "incorporating a full list of abundances ( @xmath217 species ) would be intractable for the type of calculation we have described .",
    "moreover , we can take a lesson from earth - condition crystals , which typically have only 1 , 2 , or 3 elements ( sometimes 4 ) .",
    "this appears to be due to general properties of crystal stability related to phase separation of complex unit cells : basically , once a structure reaches a sufficient level of complexity that it can accommodate the special geometrical characteristics of its constituent atoms , it is disadvantageous to make the unit cell any larger ( in the sense of adding more atoms ) , since that just reduces the amount of favorable repetition possible with a given number of atoms .",
    "exploring more ternary combinations is also likely to give diminishing returns in the prediction of new structures .",
    "roughly speaking , with a smooth and spherically - symmetric interaction such as the yukawa potential , there are only four qualitatively different ternary combinations : one big @xmath5 and two small @xmath5s , two big and one small , all three mismatched , and all three similar .",
    "as long as the screening length regimes ( characterized by @xmath32 ) are not too different , one expects to see a continuity of structures formed by systems having similar relative @xmath5s ( or perhaps squared @xmath5s ) , since there are no atom shell effects that come into play .",
    "another reason for studying the specific ternary systems mentioned above is that they cover at least three ( arguably all four ) of the qualitatively different combinations .",
    "while pressure - invariance of the @xmath0 phase diagram was anticipated in the extreme relativistic limit , it comes as some surprise that the pressure - independence persists well below this limit , nearly to the threshold for full pressure ionization .",
    "figure [ fig : ternary ] shows that for all five ternary systems studied , no @xmath34-induced phase transitions were found above @xmath56 gpa . for bcc fe , this pressure corresponds to density @xmath57 g / cc and screening length @xmath58 , or about 75 percent of the saturation value . in general , screening length on the order of the lattice spacing appears to be a requisite for @xmath34-driven phase transitions . further supporting this conclusion",
    "is the fact that the he - c - o and c - o - ne systems do nt undergo any pressure - induced transitions in the range @xmath59@xmath49 gpa ; within that range , screening lengths in these small @xmath5 systems are significantly larger than one lattice spacing .",
    "another finding is that combinations of nuclei with significantly mismatched @xmath5s are much more conducive to efficient multicomponent packings than are systems where the @xmath5s are fairly similar .",
    "for example , the fe - as - se system has an extremely simple low - pressure phase diagram : at any composition , the microstructure consists simply of phase - separated bcc crystallites .",
    "multicomponent phases appear at high pressure , but they have the simple cesium chloride structure .",
    "in contrast , the c - o - fe phase diagram is quite rich .",
    "combining one large @xmath5 and two smaller @xmath5s results in a variety of binary and ternary crystal structures ( enumerated in table [ tab : structures ] ) , all of which are more efficient ( have a higher packing fraction ) than phase - separated bcc lattices .",
    "both he - c - o and o - fe - se systems ( two large , one small ) feature all the same phases as c - o - fe , except for the two ternary compounds which do nt appear . while a continuity of structures appearing between these systems was anticipated , it is striking that at high pressures the two phase diagrams are identical .",
    "close similarity is also noted between the fe - as - se and c - o - ne systems which both consist of three similar @xmath5s .",
    "the outlier in this comparison is the nontrivial c - ne binary structure , described in table [ tab : structures ] .",
    "these observations are consistent with the idea that it is the combination of relative @xmath5s , and not of absolute @xmath5s , that is important in determining the high - pressure phase diagram .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     in the pressure and screening length regimes appropriate to this work ( while @xmath34 ranges from @xmath59 to @xmath49 gpa , @xmath32 ranges from 1.13 to 1.81 for bcc fe ) , there is a competition between close packing and next nearest neighbor interactions , which the closest packed structures tend not to win .",
    "this is exemplified by bcc s favorability over fcc , and the fact that only one of the equilibrium phases found ( magnesium diboride structure ) also appears in the phase diagram of densest binary sphere packings @xcite .",
    "the simplest multicomponent crystals have structures that are also assumed by some ionic compounds under low pressure conditions , which may reflect the fact that ionic solids have a simple close - shell electronic structure ( ionic solids also have strong + /@xmath60 coulomb interactions that are missing here ) . when a pair of @xmath5s are not too dissimilar they usually form cesium chloride structure , e.g. oc , neo , sefe , seas and asfe .",
    "when they are more dissimilar they tend to form magnesium diboride structure , e.g. ohe@xmath61 , fec@xmath61 and seo@xmath61 .",
    "magnesium diboride is our first encounter with sub - cubic symmetry , which could give rise to transport anisotropy , elastic anisotropy , and other effects such as a magnetic field coupling to the structure orientation .",
    "a quite prevalent but more complicated orthorhombic structure occurs at chemical compositions o@xmath62he@xmath62 , c@xmath62he@xmath62 , fe@xmath62o@xmath62 , fe@xmath62c@xmath62 and se@xmath62o@xmath62 , where these different instances can be interconverted by small adjustments of bond lengths and angles .",
    "a tetragonal structure occurs at compositions c@xmath62he@xmath61 and fe@xmath62o@xmath61 ; this is the second - highest density structure in the c - o - fe system and could potentially drive oxygen to greater depths than it would otherwise go .",
    "the c - o - fe system also features two ternary structures feoc@xmath62 and feo@xmath1c@xmath61 , both with hexagonal symmetry .",
    "feoc@xmath62 can be viewed as magnesium diboride structure , with the triangular magnesium planes alternating between fe and o compositions .",
    "feo@xmath1c@xmath61 consists of alternating layers of kagome o and honeycomb c , with fe at the holes in the honeycomb layers .",
    "a general feature of the the ternary bulk phase diagrams is that coexisting phases have mass density differences , due to a combination of neutron fraction and geometrical packing effects .",
    "these differences can be as large as @xmath310 percent of the total density and will result in stratification of phase domains in the presence of a gravitational field  the problem to which we now turn .",
    "here we give an application of our high pressure crystal chemistry results to white dwarfs at a given fixed overall composition .",
    "the equilibrium phase - layering diagram of a zero temperature wd is computed self - consistently , allowing for arbitrary numbers of components @xmath55 and phases @xmath63 that can be formed from these components .",
    "the problem is decomposed into two parts : one part is a microscopic phase stability calculation which produces a function @xmath64 where @xmath65 is density and @xmath66 is enthalpy per unit mass , the other is a simple stellar structure calculation which determines the pressure - radius dependence @xmath67 .",

    "evidently pure bcc phases make up the majority of the stellar interior , despite the multicomponent structures being more efficiently packed . since multicomponent phases tend to show up at interfaces , we refer to them as `` interphases . '' in the he - c - o star , for example , @xmath125-c@xmath62he@xmath62 and @xmath126-c@xmath62he@xmath61 interphases are formed between @xmath81-c and @xmath81-he , while @xmath127-oc appears at the low density part of the c - o boundary . for compositions near @xmath128 ,",
    "the thinness of the carbon shell allows o - he interphases to form , namely @xmath129-ohe@xmath61 and @xmath125-o@xmath62he@xmath62 .",
    "compared to sharp bcc - bcc interfaces , interphases offer free energy savings due to optimized crystal packing density , nearest and next - nearest neighbor interactions , etc . arising from the extra compositional degrees of freedom .",
    "interphase thinness relative to bcc strata can be understood from the gravitational contribution to the free energy having a tendency to  pull apart \" the different z components of the multicomponent phases .",
    "competition between these two energy scales apparently causes interphases to become slightly thicker with depth .",
    "consider , for example , @xmath125-c@xmath62he@xmath62 in the diagram with @xmath130 . at @xmath131 , only one simulation layer ( out of 200 )",
    "is completely filled with this compound , while an adjacent layer contains a mixture of @xmath125-c@xmath62he@xmath62 and @xmath81-he .",
    "this interphase gradually thickens with @xmath132 and by @xmath133 , 13 simulation layers are completely filled , another two are partially filled , and @xmath125-c@xmath62he@xmath62 has squeezed out @xmath81-c from the layering diagram .    an unexpected but apparently generic feature of the radius - composition curves in figure [ fig : layering ] is the existence of a shallow minimum of the wd radius at an impure composition .",
    "even as the level of numerical noise increases with further iterations , this minimum clearly persists .",
    "the cusps near @xmath134 and @xmath135 may be a numerical effect rather than a physical one , however , as they tend to smooth out upon further iterations .",
    "a simple modification of the equilibrium layering calculation enables a quasi - static settling calculation . if the settling species is @xmath136 , an additional set of linear constraints @xmath137 enforces the minimum depth @xmath138 at which @xmath136 can appear .",
    "this minimum allowed depth can then be incrementally stepped down .",
    "we carry out a test of the method by settling @xmath139 of o on a @xmath140 he - c white dwarf , and @xmath141 of ne on a @xmath142 c - o white dwarf .",
    "overall compositions are fixed at @xmath133 with @xmath143 , and @xmath144 with @xmath145 , respectively ; the final settled - out states are given by figure [ fig : layering ] .",
    "( admittedly , these are not particularly realistic settling scenarios but they serve as interesting test cases , forcing the presence of an interface between the highest and lowest @xmath5s which otherwise does nt happen in equilibrium ) .",
    "note that if the starting value for @xmath138 is too near the surface , there is no feasible solution that can accommodate the settling mass .",
    "for this reason we restrict our study to the second half of the settling problem : @xmath146 .",
    "results of the quasi - static settling calculation are plotted in figure [ fig : settling ] .     of o on a @xmath140",
    "he - c white dwarf ( top ) and settling @xmath141 of ne on a @xmath142 c - o white dwarf ( bottom ) . the @xmath147-axis can be regarded as time remaining until equilibrium , multiplied by the settling rate .",
    "white crosses give the evolution of the stellar radius during the settling process .",
    "the top(bottom ) diagram was computed using 180(200 ) layers .",
    "other details of the plots are the same as in figure [ fig : layering ] .",
    "[ fig : settling ] ]    in both settling scenarios , the out - of - equilibrium star contains one or more phases that do not appear in the final , equilibrium stacking sequence .",
    "one function of these extra phases is to serve as transient host structures for the settling species : @xmath125-o@xmath62he@xmath62 and @xmath129-ohe@xmath61 are hosts for settling oxygen , and @xmath148-ne@xmath61c@xmath62 is a host for settling neon .",
    "the phase settling diagram for the he - o - c star is fairly non - trivial , with as many as seven distinct strata near @xmath149 .",
    "a minimum in the stellar radius appears around this point ( as it also does in the o - c - ne settling calculation ) indicating that the lowest enthalpy star is not the most compact star .",
    "this minimum appears to track the size of the @xmath126-c@xmath62he@xmath61 core , possibly also the thickness of the @xmath125-o@xmath62he@xmath62 interphase .",
    "however , the minimum persists when the calculation is repeated excluding first one and then the other of these phases .",
    "these result hints at the prospects for new phenomena that are enabled by compositional and structural heterogeneity that takes advantage of the additional `` chemical '' degrees of freedom afforded by multinary phases .    in the first settling calculation",
    ", both he and c must eventually find their way through the sinking o - containing layer .",
    "it is interesting that , with the exception of a single point near @xmath150 where all the oxygen is bound up in @xmath125-o@xmath62he@xmath62 , there is no continuous migration pathway ( in the sense of stoichiometric compounds ) assuming any deviations from spherical symmetry are sufficiently weak to maintain contiguity of the layering sequence .",
    "several binary phases are available to provide such a pathway , but the system does not use them to this advantage  for example , @xmath127-oc is never formed .",
    "consequently , in the final stages of settling , carbon has to diffuse through an oxygen barrier having thickness @xmath151 km .",
    "the associated timescale can be estimated as @xmath152 , where @xmath153 is the diffusion coefficient for a one - component plasma ( see @xcite and more recently , @xcite ) .",
    "here @xmath154 is the ion plasma frequency and @xmath155 is the coulomb coupling parameter , which we take to be the melting point value : @xmath156 .",
    "putting in the numbers gives @xmath157 yrs . while this is an oversimplified analysis , it does suggests that compact object phase strata may be far from the equilibrium stacking sequence .",
    "it is particularly intriguing to consider whether strong `` chemical '' deviations from the equilibrium phase stacking sequence could accumulate excess free energy that is eventually liberated in energetic ( and thus observable ) events .",
    "our analysis here is a first step towards developing a framework towards consideration of such possibilities .",
    "here we give a brief , qualitative discussion of some effects that will become important at finite temperatures ; a detailed analysis is a subject for future work . at finite @xmath158",
    ", the chemical potentials @xmath159 must be modified to account for smearing of the fermi surface , associated smearing of the electron capture layers which will give an adjustment in composition , phonons , and if @xmath81 denotes an alloy or solution phase , mixing entropy . since the entropic part of these contributions does not enter into the enthalpy , it is not possible to self - consistently include thermal effects in our equilibrium phase layering method , which relies on the enthalpy transformation .",
    "however , thermal effects could be included post hoc .",
    "for example , one could compute the phonon free energy of an interphase crystal such as @xmath125-c@xmath62he@xmath62 along with that of the equivalent phase - separated @xmath81-c and @xmath81-he crystals , add this quantity to the @xmath0 free energy , and predict whether the interphase tends to thicken or thin at finite @xmath158 . a rough estimate based on phases bulk moduli ( @xmath160 )",
    "suggests the thermal ( phonon ) correction to the free energy will tend to increase the stability of the soft outer phase strata relative to the stiff innner strata , likely shifting the interphases slightly towards the stellar center .",
    "there is also a possibility for additional , particularly soft interphases to appear in the stacking sequence , if entropic terms are large enough to affect the phase competition that winnows the phases of table [ tab : structures ] down to the phase layering in figure [ fig : layering ] .",
    "a phonon calculation would also yield the elastic tensor and help characterize the degree of elastic anisotropy as a function of depth , as well as give a prediction for the relative melting temperatures via the lindemann parameter ( ratio of rms nucleus displacement to equilibrium lattice spacing ) .",
    "finally , we note that the simple mechanical stability criterion used here should be replaced with the ledoux criterion at finite @xmath158 .",
    "see @xcite for an application to multicomponent neutron stars .",
    "again , it is difficult to see how this more sophisticated criterion can be built in to the current method , but it could at least be checked after including thermal effects in the manner described .",
