    "the asymptotic freedom of qcd tells us that matter at extremely high temperature ( @xmath0 ) becomes a simple thermodynamic system composed of weakly interacting quarks and gluons .",

    "deviation from this limit that arise from the temperature - dependent running gauge coupling @xmath1 can be calculated perturbatively @xcite .",
    "the excitation properties of quarks and gluons in this region can also be analyzed using perturbative techniques .",
    "the fact that @xmath0 dominates over all other scales allows to adopt the hard - thermal loop ( htl ) approximation @xcite , which enables us to calculate propagators of these fields in a gauge independent way .",
    "it is known that in leading order of htl - resummed perturbation theory mass gaps arise in the excitation spectra of these degrees of freedom which are proportional to @xmath2 .",
    "they are called _ thermal masses _ @xcite .",
    "these excitations acquire decay widths owing to medium effects , which are proportional to @xmath3 . at sufficiently high @xmath0",
    "these widths thus are parametrically negligible compared to the thermal masses . in addition , a novel excitation , the plasmino , appears in the quark propagator , which has a minimum in its dispersion relation at nonzero momentum @xcite .",
    "various discussions addressed the origin of such a peculiar mode @xcite and its phenomenological consequences @xcite .",
    "as @xmath0 is lowered , the gauge coupling @xmath1 grows and perturbation theory eventually breaks down . at the same time , other scales , which are not negligible compared to @xmath0 emerge , and make the problem more complicated .",
    "this is , in particular , the case for the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) phase near the critical temperature of deconfinement , @xmath4 , which is analyzed experimentally in heavy ion collision performed currently with the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite . to analyze the highly non - perturbative properties of strongly interacting matter in the temperature range accessible to the rhic experiments , a non - perturbative approach to qcd , such as lattice qcd monte carlo simulation ,",
    "is needed .",
    "since the leading order htl - resummed perturbative calculations predict that the decay widths of quarks and gluons grow faster than the thermal masses as @xmath0 is lowered , one may navely expect that for temperatures near @xmath4 the peaks in spectral functions of these degrees of freedom disappear .",
    "in other words , a quasi - particle description of these excitations would be inappropriate near @xmath4 .",
    "there are , however , several arguments supporting the existence of quasi - particles with the quantum numbers of quarks in this region .",
    "for example , quasi - particles have been used successfully to describe lattice qcd results on the equation of states and susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "the existence of quark quasi - particles near @xmath4 is also suggested by results from lattice simulations on baryon number , electric charge and strangeness fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it is also notable that quark number scaling of the elliptic flow observed in the rhic experiments @xcite suggests the existence of quark degrees of freedom in the hot and dense matter created at rhic .",
    "direct studies of excitation properties of quarks based on first principle lattice calculations may therefore help to clarify the physics behind these findings .",
    "after some pioneering work on thermal properties of the quark propagator in lattice qcd simulations @xcite , in @xcite the authors of the present paper investigated the spectral properties of quarks at zero momentum for two values of temperature in the deconfined phase , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , in quenched lattice qcd in landau gauge . in this work ,",
    "we use a two - pole ansatz for the quark spectral function , @xmath7 , motivated by the structure of @xmath7 in the high temperature limit .",
    "this ansatz includes contributions of the normal and plasmino modes and allows to analyze the importance of thermal widths of these modes .",
    "it is found that the euclidean correlation function for quarks on the lattice is well reproduced by this ansatz .",
    "the result indicates that excitation modes of quarks form sharp peaks in @xmath7 even near @xmath4 . in this temperature range close to @xmath4 it also is found that the form of @xmath7 is similar to that in the perturbative region .",
    "it clearly is quite different from that at @xmath8 which is given by field strength renormalization @xmath9 and mass function @xmath10 @xcite .    at temperatures close to @xmath4 , the appearance of scales which are not negligible compared to @xmath0 invalidates the simple picture provided by the htl approximation , in addition to the failure of the perturbative treatment . from the analysis of simpler models , composed of fermions and bosons ,",
    "it is known that the structure of @xmath7 has a nontrivial dependence on the masses of fermions and bosons when these masses are comparable to @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "examples are the spectrum of fermions with a mass @xmath11 in qed or a yukawa model with a massless boson @xcite . in these models",
    "@xmath7 is given by the htl approximation and , in particular , receives contributions from the plasmino mode whenever @xmath12 is large enough . on the other hand , @xmath7 approaches a free quark spectral function without the plasmino mode in the low temperature @xmath13 limit .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , and summarized in appendix  [ sec : yukawa ] in the present paper , the numerical result , which has been obtain at the one loop order , shows that @xmath7 changes continuously as a function of @xmath12 between these two limits . in @xcite",
    ", we analyzed the dependence of @xmath7 on the bare quark mass , @xmath14 , for each @xmath0 and found that the lattice result are in accordance with these findings .",
    "the main purpose of the present study is to extend the analysis of @xcite to lower temperatures , closer to @xmath4 , and to non - zero momentum .",
    "in addition to the temperature values analyzed before , we performed the simulations at three lower temperatures above and below @xmath4 .",
    "we show that the results obtained in @xcite do not change qualitatively even at @xmath15 . on the other hand , we find that the two - pole approximation completely fails below @xmath4 , which indicates that excitations of quark fields with a narrow width do not exist in the confined phase .",
    "we also analyze the momentum dependence of @xmath7 and show that the dispersion relations of the normal and plasmino modes behave reasonably at finite momentum .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the spectral properties of the light and charm quarks .",
    "an important aspect of the analysis of the quark spectral function is that these spectral functions directly reflect the symmetries of the thermal system and are sensitive to their explicit or spontaneous breaking .",
    "one can , for example , clearly observe the effect of chiral symmetry breaking in the scalar channel of the quark propagator .",

    ", we confirmed that above @xmath4 two poles , the normal and plasmino excitations , appear in the quark propagator .",
    "the mass gaps of these excitation spectra should be interpreted as thermal masses , rather than dirac mass .",
    "it is found that the ratio @xmath205 is insensitive to @xmath0 in the range analyzed in this study .",
    "as the bare quark mass is increased , the spectral function eventually changes its form from that having a thermal mass to the free quark form .",
    "we found that the bare quark mass of the charm quark is close to the latter , having a single mode with a dirac mass .",
    "all analyses of the present study are based on the quenched approximation .",
    "although this approximation includes the leading contribution in the high temperature limit @xcite and thus is valid at sufficiently high @xmath0 , the validity of this approximation near @xmath4 is nontrivial .",
    "for example , screening of gluons due to the polarization of the vacuum with virtual quark antiquark pairs is neglected in this approximation .",
    "the coupling to possible mesonic excitations @xcite , which may cause interesting effects in the spectral properties of the quark @xcite , are not incorporated , either .",
    "the comparison of the quark propagator between quenched and full lattice qcd simulations would tell us the importance of these effects near @xmath4 .",
    "it also would be interesting to calculate perturbatively higher order corrections to the quasi - particle properties of quarks @xcite .",
    "such a calculation will help to clarify the origin of differences in the mass and momentum dependence of the quark propagator found in our lattice calculation in comparison to leading order perturbation theory .",
    "there are many open questions that need to be analyzed in more detail in future calculations .",
    "a numerical simulation with a large spatial volume is an important subject among them . as discussed in the text ,",

    "<S> we present an analysis of the quark spectral function above and below the critical temperature for deconfinement performed at zero and non - zero momentum in quenched lattice qcd using clover improved wilson fermions in landau gauge . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the temporal quark correlation function in the deconfined phase near the critical temperature is well reproduced by a two - pole ansatz for the spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that excitation modes of the quark field have small decay rates . </S>",
    "<S> the bare quark mass and momentum dependence of the spectral function is analyzed with this ansatz . in the chiral limit </S>",
    "<S> we find that the quark spectral function has two collective modes corresponding to the normal and plasmino excitations in the high temperature limit . over a rather wide temperature range in the deconfined phase the pole mass of these modes at zero momentum , which corresponds to the thermal mass of the quark , is approximately proportional to temperature . </S>",
    "<S> with increasing bare quark masses the plasmino mode gradually disappears and the spectral function is dominated by a single pole . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss quasi - particle properties of heavy quarks in the deconfined phase . in the confined phase , it is found that the pole ansatz for the spectral function fails completely . </S>"
