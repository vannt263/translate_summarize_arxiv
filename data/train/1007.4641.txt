    "@xmath8 is a 1-dimensional pure sheaf and @xmath9 is a morphism @xmath10 with 0-dimensional cokernel .",
    "the above theories are conjecturally equivalent in terms of generating functions . the gw / dt correspondence is proved for local toric calabi - yau 3-folds  @xcite , local curves  @xcite , @xcite , and the dt / pt correspondence ( including the euler characteristic version ) is available in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the idea of dt / pt correspondence discussed by pandharipande - thomas  @xcite is to use the wall - crossing formula of dt type invariants in the space of bridgeland s stability conditions  @xcite on the category @xmath11 , the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on @xmath1 .",
    "namely it is expected that there are two stability conditions @xmath12 , @xmath13 on @xmath11 such that the moduli space of @xmath12-stable objects and that of @xmath13-stable objects with a certain numerical condition coincide with the moduli spaces which define dt and pt theories respectively .",
    "then dt / pt correspondence should follow by investigating the behavior of the invariants under the change of stability conditions .",
    "a general framework for such a study , known as a _ wall - crossing formula of dt type invariants _ , is now established by the work of joyce - song  @xcite and kontsevich - soibelman  @xcite .",
    "however there have been difficulties in constructing stability conditions on @xmath11 , and even a single example is not available yet . instead of working with bridgeland s stability conditions , bayer  @xcite and the author  @xcite , @xcite independently introduce _ polynomial stability _ , _ limit stability _ and _ weak stability _ respectively .",
    "these notions are interpreted as ` limiting degenerations ' of bridgeland s stability conditions . by using the above degenerated stability conditions",
    ", it is turned out in  @xcite , @xcite that dt / pt correspondence is realized near a particular point , called the _ large volume limit_. by analyzing weak stability conditions near the large volume limit and the relevant wall - crossing formula , the author proves the euler characteristic version of dt / pt correspondence  @xcite and the rationality conjecture of the generating series of dt and pt invariants  @xcite .",
    "the space of stability conditions on @xmath11 is expected to be related to the stringy k@xmath0hler moduli space of @xmath1 , which is the moduli space of complex structures of a mirror manifold .",
    "for instance if @xmath1 is a quintic calabi - yau 3-fold in @xmath14 , the mirror family is a simultaneous crepant resolution @xmath15 of the following one parameter family , @xmath16 where @xmath17 . the stringy k@xmath0hler moduli space is a parameter space of @xmath18 , and the large volume limit corresponds to @xmath19 .",

    "on the other hand , there is an autoequivalence associated with @xmath21 , called _ seidel - thomas twist _",
    "@xcite , @xmath24 the above equivalence should correspond to the dehn twist of @xmath15 along the lagrangian vanishing cycle under the mirror symmetry , and should be a monodromy on @xmath11 around the conifold point . therefore the seidel - thomas twist must be relevant in studying question  [ quest ] at the conifold point , and it seems interesting to see how the twist functor is related to the wall - crossing formula .    hler moduli space of a quintic 3-fold , width=283 ]      in this paper , we focus on the triangulated category called _ d0-d2-d6 bound states _",
