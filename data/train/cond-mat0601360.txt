    "since the nitrogen - vacancy ( n - v ) center in diamond has been detected at a single site level @xcite the center has attracted attention for various quantum information processing applications .",
    "for example , the center has been used as a single photon source for quantum cryptography @xcite and work in this area has included impressive demonstrations @xcite .",
    "another area of interest results from the center having a non - zero spin ground state .",
    "the ground state spin can be the qubit and the optical transitions utilized for readout and for qubit manipulation in quantum computing applications .",
    "there are again impressive demonstrations in this area @xcite . with these successes and additional programs under development",
    "it might be expected that the properties of the n - v center are well understood . however ,",
    "this is not the case . despite the extensive publications",
    "the center is not well understood and the literature contains many inaccuracies .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to re - visit our knowledge of the nitrogen - vacancy center , provide an account of the electronic energy levels and explain the dynamics of the center under optical excitation .",
    "the n - v center occurs in diamond containing single substitutional nitrogen when irradiated and annealed @xcite .",
    "electron irradiation with energies greater than 200 kev creates vacancies @xcite .",
    "the vacancies are mobile at 800@xmath0c and can become trapped adjacent to the nitrogen impurities . the nitrogen - vacancy complex formed has a strong optical transition with a zero - phonon line at 1.945 ev ( 637 nm ) accompanied by a vibronic band at higher energy in absorption and lower energy in emission . the zero - phonon line has been studied by davies and hamer @xcite .",
    "they have studied the effect of uniaxial stress and from the splitting and polarization they established that the transition is associated with an orbital a - e transition at a site of trigonal symmetry .",
    "the trigonal symmetry is consistent with an adjacent nitrogen - vacancy pair with @xmath1 symmetry . in other studies using optical excitation loubser and",
    "van wyk detected electron spin resonance ( esr ) signals of a spin polarized triplet ( s = 1 ) @xcite .",
    "the esr they observed was associated with a center having trigonal symmetry and the magnitude of the optically induced signal was found to vary with wavelength in correspondence with the strength of the a - e optical transition .",
    "hence , the center was attributed to the same nitrogen - vacancy complex . with an integer spin ( s = 1 )",
    "the center must have an even number of electrons and it is taken that the neutral nitrogen - vacancy complex with five electrons has acquired an additional electron from elsewhere in the lattice , probably from another substitutional nitrogen atom .",
    "there will then be six electrons occupying the dangling bonds of the vacancy complex @xcite .",
    "loubser and van wyk proposed that the spin polarization arises from a singlet electronic system with inter - system crossing to a spin level of a meta - stable triplet .",
    "however , it was established from hole burning @xcite , optically detected magnetic resonance @xcite , esr @xcite and raman heterodyne measurements @xcite that the triplet is the ground state rather than a meta - stable state . therefore , their model has to be modified to give a @xmath2a ground state and a @xmath3 optical transition .",
    "the optically induced spin polarization can still arise from inter - system crossing and an account is given in this paper .",
    "the six electrons occupy the dangling bonds associated with the vacancy complex . a discussion of this situation is included in a treatment by lenef et.al .",
    "although they did not adopt the six electron model @xcite they did give a very useful general treatment including the six electron situation and their presentation allows the present discussion to be brief and more descriptive .",
    "the dangling bonds are formed from @xmath4 orbitals of the carbon and nitrogen atoms and in a vacancy approximating @xmath5 symmetry these can be combined to form @xmath6 and @xmath7 molecular orbitals with @xmath8 and t@xmath9 symmetry , respectively @xcite . from symmetry and charge overlap considerations",
    "the @xmath6 is considered to be lower in energy and the @xmath7 higher . with six electrons",
    "@xmath10 will be the lowest energy configuration and this can also be described as a @xmath11 hole system .",
    "when one of the neighboring carbons is replaced by a nitrogen the t@xmath12 symmetry will be lowered to trigonal and the @xmath7 orbital will be split to give , in @xmath1 notation , an @xmath6 and e orbital . the e hole is lower in energy and , hence , the lowest energy configuration will be @xmath13 , next lowest @xmath14 and the @xmath15 highest . the spin - orbit wave functions for the @xmath13 configuration give @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 states and the @xmath14 configuration @xmath19 and @xmath18 states .",
    "the @xmath15 gives an @xmath20a@xmath21 .",
    "the optical transition is associated with triplets and so the ground state is attributed to the @xmath22 state and the excited state to the @xmath2e(@xmath14 ) state .",
    "there are singlets @xmath17(e@xmath23 ) and @xmath18(e@xmath23 ) and @xmath18(a@xmath21e ) which could lie in the same energy range as the triplets .",
    "the @xmath20a@xmath21(a@xmath24 ) lies higher .",
    "it has been assumed that the @xmath17(e@xmath23 ) lies between the triplets and the present treatment accepts this assertion and will be shown to be consistent with observation .",
    "the possibility of intermediate @xmath20e level(s ) will be discussed .",
    "the energy , v , of each state @xmath16 , @xmath2e , @xmath17 is determined by the above bonding considerations and the hamiltonian including spin - orbit , v@xmath25 , and spin - spin , v@xmath26 , interaction is given by :    @xmath27    spin - orbit and spin - spin do not affect the degeneracy of the singlets whereas the spin degenerate ground state is only affected by spin - spin interaction normally written as :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the axial and non - axial coefficients .",
    "the interaction spits the ground state into a singlet , @xmath31a@xmath9,s@xmath32@xmath33 with symmetry a@xmath21 , and doublet , @xmath31a@xmath9,s@xmath34@xmath33 , @xmath31a@xmath9,s@xmath35@xmath33 with symmetry e. the spin states @xmath31s@xmath32@xmath33 and ( @xmath31s@xmath34@xmath33 , @xmath31s@xmath35@xmath33 ) are not mixed .",
    "the @xmath2e state are affected by both terms .",
    "v@xmath25 has the form :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the coefficients associated with the axial and non - axial spin - orbit interactions .",
    "the axial @xmath37(l@xmath32s@xmath32 ) spin - orbit interaction splits the @xmath2e spin triplet into three two - fold degenerate states ; e , e , and an ( a@xmath21 , a@xmath9 ) pair . within the @xmath2e state non - axial spin - orbit interaction is small and will be neglected at present .",
    "as will be discussed shortly spin - orbit can give mixing between adjacent states .",
    "this can cause a shifting of levels which can be calculated by including this state in the calculation or by including spin - orbit interaction to second order .",
    "the form of this latter term is the same as that of spin - spin interaction . in high symmetry ( eg t@xmath12 )",
    "this has the form @xcite :    @xmath39\\ ] ]    in trigonal symmetry one has to allow for the difference in the axial and non - axial terms .",
    "the interaction modifies the separation of the above states but does not change the wave - functions and the wave functions are the main interest here .",
    "the states and the symmetry adapted wave functions are given in fig.1(a ) .",
    "the states with s@xmath32 spin projection are not mixed with the spin states with s@xmath34 and s@xmath35 spin projection . the @xmath2a@xmath40 @xmath2e transition is orbitally allowed and , as spin projection is not changed by the electric dipole operator",
    ", the optical transitions will be the same strength for each of the spin projections ( shown as solid vertical arrows in fig.1(a ) ) .",
    "there are no transitions involving a change of spin and it can be concluded that optical cycling of the @xmath2a@xmath9 - @xmath2e transition will not result in change of spin projection and consequently can not give any spin polarization",
    ". this situation does not change when considering vibronic interactions as spin projection is conserved .",
    "spin - orbit interaction mixes singlets and triplets which transform according to the same irreducible representation .",
    "the mixing provides an avenue whereby symmetric vibration can cause a population relaxation between the mixed singlets and triplets .",
    "the symmetry considerations , therefore , determine the allowed inter - system crossing and these are also shown in fig .",
    "where there is only a @xmath20a@xmath21 singlet level the inter - system crossing is restricted to states that transform as a@xmath21 irreducible representations .",
    "there can be excitation of population out of the e ground state level with s@xmath34 or s@xmath35 spin projection to the a@xmath21 spin - orbit level of the @xmath2e state .",
    "population in this state can decay via the singlet to the s@xmath32 spin projection of the ground state .",
    "such an excitation and decay , therefore , causes a re - orientation of the ground state spin projection and with continuous excitation population can be transferred to the ground s@xmath32 spin state .",
    "this is consistent with the preferred spin orientation established experimentally @xcite . with these selection rules , assuming the optical induced spin polarization is faster than spin - lattice relaxation ,",
    "the spin polarization would be 100@xmath41 but this is not what is observed @xcite .",
    "the extra consideration is the non - axial @xmath38(l@xmath34s@xmath34 + l@xmath35s@xmath35 ) spin - orbit interaction which we have previously neglected . this spin - orbit term causes a mixing of the two @xmath2e states ( denoted e and e ) transforming as an e irreducible representation .",
    "these states have different s@xmath32 and s@xmath34,s@xmath35 spin projections and , hence , the mixing gives rise to optical transitions that do not conserve spin ( dashed arrows in fig.1 ) .",
    "the transitions are observed in hole burning spectra @xcite and are the transitions that limit the degree of spin polarization .",
    "it is anticipated that the strength of the non - axial spin - orbit interaction is small .",
    "this is concluded from consideration of the the one electron operators .",
    "spin - orbit interaction will be isotropic for t@xmath9 orbits in t@xmath12 symmetry but the axial contribution is quenched when the orbit is split into two - fold degenerate and non - degenerate states . in c@xmath42",
    "the non - axial spin - orbit interaction between the individual two - fold degenerate states is formally allowed but its contribution arises from higher order effects .",
    "the non - axial spin - orbit interaction is , therefore , anticipated to be small and the non - spin conserving optical transitions will be weak . although weak the transitions play an important role in limiting the degree of spin polarization .",
    "the excited state is split by spin - orbit interaction whereas the ground state is split by spin - spin interaction ( not shown to scale ) .",
    "the figure gives the symmetry adapted wave - functions .",
    "the solid arrows indicate the spin - allowed optical transitions .",
    "the dashed arrows indicated weak transitions which are allowed through the mixing of the ( @xmath2e)e and ( @xmath43e basis states by transverse spin - orbit interaction .",
    "the diagonal arrows give inter - system crossing allowed by spin - orbit interaction .",
    "( b ) energy levels and wave functions of the n - v center in the presence of a strain field .",
    "the wave functions are appropriate for a strain field perpendicular to a reflection plane .",
    "the transitions are derived from those allowed in ( a).,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we briefly consider the situation where a @xmath20e state(s ) lies between the @xmath2a@xmath9 and @xmath2e . if this were the case there could be symmetry allowed relaxation from the excited triplet ( @xmath2e)e and ( @xmath2e)e states to such an intermediate @xmath20e singlet state . however , using the two hole description the relaxation is found to be forbidden in the case of the triplet ( @xmath2e)e state ( cancellation of terms for a @xmath20e(a@xmath21e ) and forbidden for one electron operators for @xmath20e(e@xmath23 ) states ) implying that there will still not be population transfer out of states with s@xmath32 spin projection .",
    "there can be relaxation from the other triplet ( @xmath2e)e state involving the s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 spin projections to a @xmath20e level .",
    "given that there is also an intermediate @xmath20a@xmath21 there can be two alternate situations depending on the ordering of the @xmath20a@xmath21 and @xmath20e singlet levels . should the @xmath20e state lie lowest the decay will be to the ( @xmath2a@xmath9)e component of the ground state .",
    "this state has a s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 spin projection and the optical cycling will have had no consequence implying no change in spin orientation .",
    "however , if the @xmath20e state lies above the @xmath17 level there will be radiative ( or non - radiative ) decay to the lower singlet level , the @xmath17 , followed by the relaxation , as discussed in the previous paragraph , to the s@xmath32 spin projection of the ground state",
    ". this process will lead to the same spin change and spin polarization as before .",
    "the simple consequence of involving the @xmath20e singlet is that the total ( @xmath17 plus @xmath18 ) spin polarization process will be more efficient .",
    "thus , if there is an intermediate @xmath20e state , to be consistent with observation it must lie at an energy higher than the @xmath17 state .",
    "it is recognized that this order is in disagreement with calculated energy levels @xcite .",
    "however , there is an appeal of including a higher single @xmath18 state as it could lie close to the excited triplet level and the @xmath17 close to the ground state thus accounting for the relatively fast inter - system crossing reported below .",
    "however , there is no fundamental difference in the dynamics and it is sufficient in this work to restrict the discussion to one singlet level , a @xmath20a@xmath21 .",
    "it is common for there to be strain in diamond and it is worth considering the consequence to the energy levels and the associated dynamics .",
    "there will be no fundamental change with axial strain as all it gives is a uniform shift of the energy levels and no change of the wave functions or the dynamics .",
    "however , the component of the strain at right angles to the axis of the center lowers the symmetry and the extra crystal field lifts the orbital degeneracy of the excited state to give two orbital non - degenerate states denoted e@xmath34 and e@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "we consider the case where this strain splitting is larger than the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "where the strain retains a reflection plane the z , x , y axes will be determined by symmetry .",
    "the wave functions for this situation are as given in fig.1(b ) .",
    "the diagonal spin - orbit interaction is quenched and the order of states ( same in both optical components ) are determined by spin - spin interaction . in the limit of small non - axial spin - orbit interaction there is still little mixing of the s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 spin states with the s@xmath32 spin states .",
    "the transitions and inter - system crossing can be determined from the parent state and are shown in fig .",
    "the spin allowed transitions will have near the same strength as in the zero strain case but they are now totally polarized . the only minor change is loss to the dashed transitions between the states with different s@xmath34 and s@xmath35 projections . these arise where the strain is not sufficient to totally quench the effect of the diagonal spin - orbit interaction .",
    "a more significant effect is in the strength of the non - spin - conserving transitions induced by non - axial spin - orbit interaction .",
    "they will become significantly stronger as the separation of the s@xmath32 and ( s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 ) is reduced and the mixing increased .",
    "when the strain does not retain reflection symmetry the effective x and y axis may be different between ground and excited states and all transitions and inter - system crossings will become allowed in principle ( no symmetry restrictions )",
    ". however , the selection rules will be dominated by those allowed in zero order and the perturbation approach in fig .",
    "1(b ) is anticipated to give a reasonable approximation to the dominant excitation and decay channels .    which of the diagrams , fig.1(a ) or fig.1(b ) ( or an intermediate case ) , is appropriate for a given center depends on the relative magnitude of the stress , spin - orbit and spin - spin interaction .",
    "spin - orbit for the carbon atom is known to be a few @xmath44 ( @xmath45200 ghz ) and a spin - orbit splitting of 1 @xmath44 ( 30 ghz ) was obtained for the @xmath2e state from optical magnetic circular dichroism measurements @xcite .",
    "this value maybe marginally high as an optical line width of 15 ghz has been reported recently for small ensembles within single crystals of diamond @xcite and there is an indication that spin - spin interaction may also contribute to the line width .",
    "santouri et .",
    "@xcite have also shown , using two - laser hole burning experiments , that for even a small strain splitting of 10 ghz the energy scheme is equivalent to fig .",
    "as strain splitting is usually much larger ( @xmath33 100ghz ) it is taken that this energy scheme will be typical of centers in an ensemble sample as used here .",
    "the dynamics associated with optical excitation can be determined without detailed knowledge of the excited state energy levels .",
    "this is because from the above discussion it can be seen that the system can be reasonably quantized by its spin projection s@xmath32 or ( s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 ) and this is not altered by stress .",
    "the dynamics are largely determined by the crossing between these two spin projections and the symmetry considerations give the two main mechanisms .",
    "the changes of spin are through the inter - system crossing via the singlet and through the weak non - spin - conserving optical transitions .",
    "the effective energy scheme is given in fig.2 where the s@xmath32 states are shown on the left and the ( s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 ) on the right .",
    "the singlets are drawn centrally .",
    "spin polarization involves displacement of population from the states on the right to the states on the left . the transitions including those that change the spin projection are shown as solid lines as determined by the parent states in c@xmath42 symmetry . for completeness other transitions allowed in low symmetry",
    "are shown as dashed lines .",
    "the low symmetry situation is similar to that proposed by others @xcite and to assist comparison we adopt their shortened notation .",
    "the ground spin states are defined as x , y and z ; the excited triplet states as x , y and z and the singlet level as s. in the following experiments we determine the values of the parameters using bulk samples .",
    "several type 1b diamonds were used in these studies . they were irradiated with energetic electrons ( @xmath33 mev ) and annealed .",
    "the nitrogen - vacancy concentrations varied from 3 x 10@xmath46 per cm@xmath2 to 10@xmath48 per cm@xmath2 and there was no indication that the dynamics of the optical cycle varied significantly for concentrations in this range .",
    "the experiments involve transient and cw excitation studies using a frequency doubled nd : yag laser .",
    "the excitation wavelength is 532 nm which is near the peak of the @xmath2a@xmath9 @xmath49 @xmath2e absorption band .",
    "the emission was detected by a s-20 photomultiplier or pin diode with a response time of 30 ns . with the exception of the measurement of the spectrum the emission wavelength detected was selected using absorptive filters .    the studies involved three different excitation and detection geometries . for low level excitation the intensity was determined from the laser power and the beam diameter .",
    "the emission at 45@xmath50 was focussed on the pin diode . for high intensity measurements a confocal arrangement with an oil immersion objective was used .",
    "the excited diameter was 0.2 micron with the emission spot focussed onto a pinhole .",
    "a 1 mw beam gave an estimated power density of 2 x 10@xmath51 w / cm@xmath23 .",
    "with the small excitation and detection volumes the signals were weak and long collection times were required to obtain satisfactory signal to noise ratios .",
    "the majority of the measurements were taken with a third geometry where satisfactory signals could be obtained more rapidly .",
    "the light was focused with a microscope objective and the back emission collected by the same objective .",
    "for the same laser power the intensity at the sample was approximately two orders of magnitude lower than that obtained with oil immersion objective and it required a 100 mw laser beam to obtain a maximum intensity of 2 x 10@xmath51 w /cm@xmath23 .",
    "the unsatisfactory feature of this geometry is that the intensity was not constant over the collected volume .",
    "at low intensities where slow ( @xmath33ms ) responses were obtained the light was gated with a mechanical chopper whereas for the fast speeds associated with the high intensities the light was gated using two acousto - optic modulators in series .",
    "the rise time of the a - o modulators is 30 ns .",
    "when gating off there was a weak component that lasted for a @xmath53s .",
    "however , no measurements were taken when gating the light off .",
    "the emission of the n - v center has been reported on many occasions .",
    "the general characteristics are shown in fig.3 .",
    "near room temperature the emission gives a band stretching from 630 nm to 800 nm with vibrational structure and a weak zero - phonon line at 637 nm ( fig.3(a ) ) .",
    "cooling has little effect on the vibronic absorption band @xcite and consequently there is little change in the amount of light absorbed from the laser beam when using an excitation wavelength within the vibronic band .",
    "consistent with this , the total emission does not show a significant change when the temperature is lowered ( insert in fig.3(a ) ) .",
    "the most obvious change in cooling to low temperatures is that the zero - phonon line becomes sharper and more prominent ( fig.3(b ) ) .",
    "the huang - rys factor is 3.7 with only 2.7 percent of the transition strength being associated with the zero - phonon transition @xcite . at high excitation densities",
    "there can be photo - ionization of the n - v center of interest and the creation of the neutrally charged [ n - v]@xmath54 center @xcite .",

    "4 . in the dark",
    "the sample becomes unpolarized and when excited the emission has an initial intensity level a. after exciting for a period the sample becomes polarized and the strength of the emission increases to a second value b ( fig.4(a ) ) .",
    "the rate at which the emission increases from the level a to b is linearly dependent on the excitation intensity .",
    "should the sample be in the dark for a period less that the spin - lattice relaxation time ( t@xmath21 ) the initial emission level will be at a value between a and b and varying the dark period varies this level .",
    "this variation of emission level with the duration in the dark can be used to establish the spin lattice relaxation time and measurements of this type are shown in fig.4(b ) .",
    "the a / b ratio is of considerable interest . to ensure a satisfactory a measurement",
    "it is necessary to have the sample in the dark for a period long compared to t@xmath21 whereas to obtain the saturation value b the intensity has to be sufficient to obtain the higher emission level within a time short compared to t@xmath21 .",

    "it is noted that the present model indicates that there should be two components to the emission decay associated with excited states , one with z and one with x,y. the emission from z excited state has the slower decay rate and dominates when the system is spin polarized , perhaps explaining why the two values ( differing by only 30@xmath41 ) have not been detected .",
    "two components of 9 ns and 2 ns have been observed by hanzana et al @xcite but the measurements are inconsistent with previous values .",
    "these lifetimes require further investigation .",
    "the increase in emission from a level a to a level b can be used to establish the fraction of the population transferring into the singlet . for example",
    "the 14% emission change between having all the population in the z spin ground state and having the population evenly distributed between the three spin states implies 27 % of the population from each of the x , y excited spin states transferring non - radiatively to the singlet , s. this has to be increased to 39% to allow for the incomplete spin polarization reported below .",
    "the inter - system crossing rates are then k@xmath64 = k@xmath65 = 30 x 10@xmath51 s@xmath61 . in correspondence with the model ,",
    "the inter - system crossing from the z state to the singlet is taken to be zero and , hence , k@xmath66 = 0 .",
    "for the low intensities no population is maintained in the singlet .",
    "this is changed at high intensities and the transient emission displays different characteristics . with population being stored in the singlet level there is a drop in emission and this is observed in all of the two - pulse experiments ( figs.5 , 6 and 7 ) .",
    "there will be no initial peak if the excitation is gated on and off within a few ns as there will be no change in the singlet population .",
    "the recovery of the peak requires a period in the dark ( fig.5 ) and the time required corresponds to the rate at which population decays from the singlet to the ground state .",
    "the value of the singlet lifetime obtained from this peak recovery is 0.3 @xmath53s and this gives k@xmath67 = 3.3 x 10@xmath51 s@xmath61 .",
    "as in the model we take k@xmath68 = k@xmath69 = 0 .    in a recent paper",
    "we have reported that the maximum spin polarization obtained for an ensemble under continuous excitation is 80@xmath41 @xcite .",
    "this means that the probability of optically transferring spin projection from the z spin state to an x , y spin is 1/4 of the above process giving rise to the spin polarization .",
    "the mechanism is attributed to the non - spin conserving optical transitions ( diagonal arrows between triplet levels in fig .",
    "2 ) and implies that the rate constants are k@xmath70 = k@xmath71 = k@xmath72 = k@xmath73 = 1.5 x 10@xmath51 s@xmath61 .",
    "loss of spin polarization could also arise from the reverse inter - system crossing via the singlet level .",
    "however , the model predicts that the rate is zero , k@xmath66 = 0 and , as given previously , the decay from the singlet to the x and y ground states are also zero .",
    "in the previous section estimates of the parameters of the model in fig.2 have been obtained from simple experimental observations . by adopting these parameters",
    "we can determine the populations and the emission for any optical field by solving the classical rate equations :    @xmath74    where n@xmath75 is the population of level i ( i = z , x , y , z , x , y , s ) . and k@xmath76 gives the rate for the i @xmath77 j transition .",
    "the significant parameters associated with the optical transitions are :    @xmath78    where the values within brackets are equal in first order .",
    "the related optically driven terms are obtained by setting k@xmath76 = k * k@xmath79 where k indicates the strength of the optical pumping .",
    "k = 1 corresponds to the case where the optical pumping rate of the allowed transitions equals the emission decay rates .",
    "the inter - system crossings are determined by the rates :    @xmath80    there are no reverse terms associated with the inter - system crossing and , hence , the related parameters with the indices reversed are zero . likewise all the relaxation rates between the spin levels z , x and y and between levels z , x and y are small .",
    "these parameters can be considered equal and given a small value but the effects are not significant in the calculated responses .",
    "where a sample has been in the dark for a period long compared to the spin - lattice relaxation time the population will initially be equally distributed over the three ground state spin levels , z , x and y. emission is established in a time of the order of the excited state lifetime of 10 - 20 ns and with continuing excitation the emission level increases as population is transferred to the z state ( fig.8 ) .",
    "this behavior is in correspondence with observation ( fig.4 ) .",
    "however , little significance can be drawn as there has not been an independent measurement of the optical pumping rate and the magnitude of the rise in fig.4 has been used in determining the parameters of the system .    .",
    "the value of the parameters in units of 10@xmath51 s@xmath61 introduced in the text are k@xmath81 = k@xmath82 = k@xmath83 = 77 ; k@xmath67 = 3.3 , k@xmath68 = k@xmath69 = 0 ; k@xmath66 = 0 ; k@xmath64 = k@xmath65 = 30 ; k@xmath70 = k@xmath71 = k@xmath84 = k@xmath85 = 1.5,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    other than the optical pumping rate there are no free parameters when calculating the emission associated with the dual pulses experiments . in these experiments the intensities are high and the transfer of population into the singlet level is initially faster than the relaxation from the singlet to the ground state .",
    "consequently there is a build up of singlet population and associated with this there is a drop in the emission level . the situation is calculated for a light field switched on and held constant for 1@xmath53s , switched off for 1@xmath53 and then switched on again for a further 1@xmath53s . with the intense excitation the system reaches equilibrium during the 1@xmath53s pulse and so is spin polarized well before the end of the first pulse . in the dark period there is a relaxation of the singlet population but there is no loss in spin - polarization .",
    "the result is that for the second light pulse the system starts spin polarized with a preferential population in the z spin ground state . in this case",
    "the transfer to the singlet is less efficient and the build up of population in the singlet level is slower .",
    "this accounts for the observed slower drop in emission intensity with the second pulse . the behavior for representative intensities is shown in fig .",
    "9 .    the results of the calculations can be compared with the experimental measurements of fig .",
    "it should be recognized that the calculations are for a simpler situation than realized experimentally .",
    "the calculations are for an ensemble of identical centers with identical optical pumping rates whereas the experiment involves four orientations and variation in the optical pumping rates .",
    "the consequence of these factors can be approximated by adding a square wave emission response to the calculated emission response before comparing with experiment .",
    "the structured component of the response ( the peak ) will then represent a smaller fraction of each pulse .",
    "another important consideration is that photo - ionization has not been included . in the calculations",
    "the peak of the second pulse is stronger than that of the first whereas it is the reverse in the experiment .",
    "the difference is due to photo - ionization .",
    "photo - ionization causes there to be a reduction in the number of n - v centers during the first pulse ( giving small alteration to the slope ) .",
    "the recovery is slow and there is no recovery during the short dark period .",
    "hence , the number of centers involved is larger at the start of the first pulse than at the start of the second pulse . when allowing for these factors and recognizing that the parameters have been determined from independent measurements the correspondence between the calculated responses in fig.9 and equivalent experimental traces in fig.6 is very satisfactory .",
    "the value of the parameters are given in the text and summarized in the caption of fig .",
    "a magnetic field other than along the trigonal axis causes mixing of the spin states @xcite and consequently with a randomly oriented field the populations are not associated with separate z , x and y states .",
    "the effect can be approximated by retaining equal populations in the three spin projections and the result of doing this is shown in fig .",
    "the upper trace gives the response in the absence of a magnetic field and is the same as in the previous section with k = 1 .",
    "for the lower trace the populations in the three ground spin states are equalized . when this is done to approximate the effect of a magnetic field",
    ", there is no spin polarization and the responses are the same for the two pulses . with",
    "the field applied there continues to be optical excitation from the x , y state and more efficient transfer into the singlet level .",
    "the result is that the equilibrium population in the singlet level is higher and less centers contribute to the emission .",
    "the final emission is lower and this is what is observed .",
    "it should be noted that equivalent effects can be obtained by applying resonant microwave fields to maintain population in the x , y states . at high intensities",
    "the drop in equilibrium emission level caused by the microwave field can be much larger @xcite than the 14@xmath41 obtained at low intensities .",
    "this is due to the change of the population stored in the singlet level .    .",
    "the value of the parameters are given in the text and summarized in the caption of fig .",
    "8.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in comparing the responses with and without an applied magnetic field there is a variation in the magnitude of the peaks .",
    "the peak in the emission associated with the first pulse is similar with and without field .",
    "however , the magnitudes associated with the second pulse are very different .",
    "as discussed previously , the difference in peak heights between the first and second pulses is due to photo - ionization varying the number of centers .",
    "a smaller second peak indicates that the magnetic field has caused an increase in the photo - ionization .",
    "this can be attributed to the field increasing the population in the excited states ( excited triplet plus singlet ) and the ionization being out of these states .",
    "it is desirable to establish whether the ionization occurs through tunnelling out of these states or is light induced .",
    "this requires further investigation .",
    "there have been many publications referring to the singlet level in the n - v center and many of these publications give information that is in conflict with the current model .",
    "the disparities are discussed below .    in the present work",
    "it is shown that the singlet has a short lifetime of 0.3 @xmath53s .",
    "this contrasts with the value of 0.275 s given when the intermediate @xmath20a singlet was first proposed .",
    "redman et.al .",
    "@xcite deduced that a long lived electronic state accounted for a narrow 1.2 hz resonance observed in a near degenerate 4-wave mixing experiment .",
    "they recognized that the narrow resonance could be associated with a long lived spin state but their estimates of the spin - lattice relaxation times suggested otherwise .",
    "however , a spin - lattice relaxation time of 0.275 s is quite realistic for n - v centers in diamond and we consider that this was the correct interpretation . in this case",
    "their data can be explained without invoking a long lived singlet state and the information would be consistent with that presented here .",
    "the presence of a long lived singlet has also been adopted in accounting for the loss of emission from single centers as temperature is lowered @xcite . with excitation",
    "it was considered that the singlet becomes populated but there is a thermally stimulated back transfer to the emitting level such that at room temperature there is little loss of emission",
    ". the back transfer decreases with lowering temperature and the center can remain in the singlet level for a considerable time resulting in a drop of the average emission intensity .",
    "this decrease in intensity occurs for zero - phonon line excitation .",
    "however , if the explanation is correct there will be an equivalent loss of emission when the excitation is within the vibronic band .",
    "this is not the case .",
    "there is little change in n - v emission intensity with a lowering of temperature ( see fig.3 ) .",
    "the more likely explanation for the loss of emission in the case of zero - phonon line excitation is spectral hole - burning .",
    "there are a range of processes ( change of spin state , re - orientation of center or movement of charge in the neighborhood of the center ) which can shift the absorption frequency and cause a decrease of absorption for a laser held at fixed frequency . with a decrease in absorption",
    "there will be an equivalent decrease in emission and the effect will become more pronounced as the temperature is lowered due to narrowing of the homogeneous line width .",
    "the decrease in emission is , therefore , attributed to this process and not with populating the singlet level .",
    "clearly no information about the energy of a singlet can be obtained from such experiments . @xcite .",
    "it is often assumed that there is no decay from the singlet to the ground state @xcite .",
    "should this be the case the spin polarization would have to arises through the back transfer and such a process would be strongly temperature dependent .",
    "this is not what is observed .",
    "spin polarization occurs from liquid helium temperatures to room temperatures and in the original measurements of spin polarization loubser and van wyk @xcite have shown that the polarization is maintained to 500 k. another more important issue is to question how spin polarization arises with the thermal back transfer process .",
    "no details have been presented as to how the spin polarization occurs .",
    "this is in contrast with the present model where , rather than back transfer , there is decay from the singlet direct to the ground state . with the decay channels proposed one can readily account for the spin polarization .",
    "it can be concluded that the n - v center can be understood without back transfer playing a role .",
    "it is noted that the analysis of the photon statistics associated with emission from single n - v centers @xcite has assumed that either there is significant singlet - triplet back transfer or a long lived singlet state ( or both ) .",
    "consequently the parameters reported are inconsistent with the values obtained here .",
    "such measurements need to be re - analyzed using the present model and consideration given to contributions associated with photo - ionization .",
    "wrachtrup and co - workers at university of stuttgart and at the national academy of sciences of belarus have presented an exciting range of single site measurements including demonstrating aspects of quantum computing @xcite . in the model adopted to interpret their results they have spin as a good quantum number and spin - orbit interaction",
    "is neglected .",
    "it is doubtful that spin - orbit can be totally neglected but it is small and there is a correspondence in the energy level schemes and selection rules between their work and that given here .",
    "there are also some similarities in the values of the parameters .",
    "for example , we have determined that the rate constant for inter - system crossing from the excited x,y states to the singlet s has a value of k@xmath64 = k@xmath65 = 0.39 x 1/@xmath57 .",
    "this is in good correspondence with a value of 0.5 x 1/@xmath57 given by nizovtsev et.al .",
    "they have also proposed that there is much slower transfer from the @xmath2e z state to the singlet and we agree with this conclusion .",
    "they have given a value of k@xmath66 = 2.5 x 10@xmath86 x 1/@xmath57 .",
    "in our model it is considered to be zero but a small value such as they have given does not change the behavior of the system .",
    "there is , therefore , reasonable agreement when considering the populating of the singlet level .",
    "the situation for transfer out of the singlet level is different and there is some confusion .",
    "there is no agreement when the singlet is taken to have the long 0.275 s lifetime and when there is no decay from this singlet to the ground state @xcite .",
    "in this situation the spin polarization and transfer out of the singlet has to be through thermal back transfer plus optically driven processes .",
    "however , these processes are not consistent with the optically induced spin polarization being independent of temperature and linear @xcite .",
    "as there are no such processes in our model there can be no comparison made with the parameters given .",
    "in other work @xcite direct transfer from the singlet to the ground state is indicated and mention made of a short singlet lifetime @xcite .",
    "no parameters are given to enable a comparison but clearly there is a consistency with the model presented here .",
    "jelezko et al @xcite have observed a single sharp zero - phonon line in the excitation spectrum of single centers .",
    "this is a very significant observation as it is crucial for readout for many n - v quantum information processing applications .",
    "detection requires there to be a transition that cycles without change of spin projection and their observation indicates that the z @xmath49 z transition can cycle @xmath45100,000 x before the change occurs @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to that obtained by our model , where with present parameters , the cycling of the z @xmath49",
    "z transition would be limited to @xmath4550 x before a change of spin state . in the model",
    "the cycling is limited by the non - spin - conserving optical transitions and , as noted earlier , the strength of these transitions vary with strain .",
    "strain varies the separation of s@xmath32 and ( s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 ) spin levels and consequently the degree of mixing via the non - axial spin - orbit interaction .",
    "this variation has been investigated experimentally by santouri et al @xcite . by studying small regions of an irradiated crystal",
    "they were able to obtain an inhomogeneous line width ( 15 ghz ) orders of magnitude narrower than obtained previously .",
    "changing the spacial location gave spectra for different magnitudes of strain and the @xmath2e splitting was resolved .",
    "furthermore , clear hyperfine structure associated with the various optical transitions was obtained from two - laser hole burning measurements .",
    "previous two - laser hole burning data indicated that the s@xmath32 spin state was lowest in both the lower and upper component of the strain - split @xmath2e state .",
    "this is confirmed in the recent hole burning measurements and it is shown that this is the case with even small strain splittings of @xmath87 10 ghz . with such strain fields",
    "the order of the levels is , therefore , dominated by `` spin - spin type '' terms rather than by spin - orbit .",
    "the effect of this interaction at zero strain in fig .",
    "1(a ) is to displace the s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 states with respect to the s@xmath32 .",
    "this increases the spin separations in the upper branch and reduces the separation in the lower branch ( or vice versa ) and with increasing strain there will be a crossing of the spin levels in the lower energy branch ( between fig 1(a ) and 1(b ) ) .",
    "thus , in the lower branch the levels are closer and give larger mixing of s@xmath32 and s@xmath34 , s@xmath35 spin states .",
    "transitions to the lower branch are , therefore , conducive to hole burning and electromagnetic induced transparency @xcite as both require non - spin conserving transitions .",
    "alternatively transitions to the upper level are more favorable for cyclic transitions and with low strain such transitions may account for the very cyclic transitions observed by jelezko et .",
    "al . @xcite .",
    "an understanding of these processes and their variability require knowledge of the magnitude of the interactions associated with the @xmath2e excited state .",
    "this has not been obtained in detail and remains an outstanding issue for a full understanding of the electronic structure of the n - v center .",
    "in this work group theoretical considerations have been used to account for the electronic states of the n - v center , for the optical transitions and for the inter - system crossing .",
    "the account leads to a seven level model where the dynamics are dominated by four rate constants .",
    "these four rate constants are determined from independent experimental measurements and it is shown that with the values obtained the model gives plausible correspondence with additional optical measurements of ensembles . the comparison between theory and experiment is not fully quantitative but the agreement is sufficient to give confidence in the appropriateness of the model .",
    "a good physical understanding of the response of the center to optical excitation is obtained and the significance is that the model provides a basis for the development of strategies to target the remaining outstanding issues regarding the properties of the n - v center .",
    "the model also provides a sufficient understanding of the dynamics to allow for satisfactory development of many n - v applications .",
