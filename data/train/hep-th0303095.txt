    "the idea of extra dimensions was proposed in the early twentieth century by nordstrom and a few years later by kaluza and klein @xcite .",
    "it has reemerged over the years in theories combining the principles of quantum mechanics and relativity . in particular theories based on supersymmetry , especially superstring theories , are naturally expressed in more than four dimensions @xcite .",
    "four dimensional physics is retrieved by kaluza  klein reduction , i.e compactifying on a manifold of small size , typically much smaller than the size of an atomic nucleus .",
    "recent developments in string theory and its extension m ",
    "theory have suggested another approach to compactify extra spatial dimensions . according to these developments ,",
    "the standard model particles are confined on a hypersurface ( called brane ) embedded in a higher dimensional space ( called bulk ) . only gravity and other exotic matter such as",
    "the dilaton can propagate in the bulk .",
    "our universe may be such a brane  like object .",
    "this idea was originally motivated phenomenologically ( see @xcite@xcite ) and later revived in string theory . within the brane world scenario ,",
    "constraints on the size of extra dimensions become weaker , because the standard model particles propagate only in three spatial dimensions .",
    "newton s law of gravity , however , is sensitive to the presence of extra  dimensions .",
    "gravity is being tested only on scales larger than a tenth of a millimeter and possible deviations below that scale can be envisaged .    from the string theory point of view ,",
    "brane worlds of the kind discussed in this review spring from a model suggested by horava and witten @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling limit of the @xmath0 heterotic string theory at low energy is described by eleven dimensional supergravity with the eleventh dimension compactified on an orbifold with @xmath1 symmetry , i.e. an interval .",
    "the two boundaries of spacetime ( i.e. the orbifold fixed points ) are 10dimensional planes , on which gauge theories ( with the @xmath2 gauge groups ) are confined .",
    "later witten argued that 6 of the 11 dimensions can be consistently compactified on a calabi ",
    "yau threefold and that the size of the calabi - yau manifold can be substantially smaller than the space between the two boundary branes @xcite .",
    "thus , in that limit space ",
    "time looks five  dimensonal with four dimensional boundary branes @xcite .",
    "this provides the underlying picture for many brane world models proposed so far .",
    "another important ingredient was put forward by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and dvali ( add ) , @xcite and @xcite , following an earlier idea by antoniadis @xcite , who suggested that by confining the standard model particle on a brane the extra dimensions can be larger than previously anticipated .",
    "they considered a flat bulk geometry in ( @xmath3)dimensions , in which @xmath4 dimensions are compact with radius @xmath5 ( toroidal topology ) .",
    "the four  dimensional planck mass @xmath6 and the ( @xmath3)dimensional planck mass @xmath7 , the gravitational scale of the extra dimensional theory , are related by @xmath8 gravity deviates from newton s law only on scales smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "since gravity is tested only down to sizes of around a millimeter , @xmath5 could be as large as a fraction of a millimeter .",
    "add assumed that the bulk geometry is flat .",
    "considerable progress was made by randall and sundrum , who considered _ non  flat _",
    ", i.e. warped bulk geometries @xcite , @xcite . in their models ,",
    "the bulk spacetime is a slice of anti  de sitter spacetime , i.e. a space - time with a negative cosmological constant .",
    "their discovery was that , due to the curvature of the bulk space time , newton s law of gravity can be obtained on the brane of positive tension embedded in an infinite extra  dimension .",
    "small corrections to newton s law are generated and constrain the possible scales in the model to be smaller than a millimetre .",
    "they also proposed a two  brane model in which the hierarchy problem , i.e. the large discrepancy between the planck scale at @xmath9 gev and the electroweak scale at @xmath10 gev , can be addressed .",
    "the large hierarchy is due to the highly curved ads background which implies a large gravitational red - shift between energy scale on the two branes . in this scenario ,",
    "the standard model particles are confined on a brane with negative tension sitting at @xmath11 , whereas a positive tension brane is located at @xmath12 .",
    "the large hierarchy is generated by the appropriate inter - brane distance , i.e. the radion .",
    "it can be shown that the planck mass @xmath13 measured on the negative tension brane is given by ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the five  dimensional planck mass and @xmath17 the ( negative ) cosmological constant in the bulk .",
    "thus , we see that , if @xmath16 is not very far from the electroweak scale @xmath18tev , we need @xmath19 , in order to generate a large planck mass on our brane . hence , by tuning the radius @xmath20 of the extra dimension to a reasonable value , one can obtain a very large hierarchy between the weak and the planck scale . of course , a complete realization of this mechanism requires an explanation for such a value of the radion . in other words ,",
    "the radion needs to be stabilized at a certain value .",
    "the stabilization mechanism is not thoroughly understood , though models with a bulk scalar field have been proposed and have the required properties @xcite .",
    "another puzzle which might be addressed with brane models is the cosmological constant problem .",
    "one may invoke an extra dimensional origin for the apparent ( almost ) vanishing of the cosmological constant .",
    "the self - tuning idea @xcite advocates that the energy density on our brane does not lead to a large curvature of our universe . on the contrary , the extra dimension becomes highly curved , preserving a flat minkowski brane with apparent vanishing cosmological constant .",
    "unfortunately , the simplest realization of this mechanism with a bulk scalar field fails due to the presence of a naked singularity in the bulk .",
    "this singularity can be shielded by a second brane whose tension has to be fine - tuned with the original brane tension @xcite . in a sense , the fine tuning problem of the cosmological constant reappears through the extra dimensional back - door .",
    "finally , we will later discuss in some detail another spectacular consequence of brane cosmology , namely the possible modification to the friedmann equation at very high energy @xcite .",
    "this effect was first recognised in @xcite in the context of inflatonary solutions .",
    "as we will see , friedmann s equation has , for the randall  sundrum model , the form ( @xcite and @xcite ) @xmath21 relating the expansion rate of the brane @xmath22 to the ( brane ) matter density @xmath23 and the ( effective ) cosmological constant @xmath24 .",
    "the cosmological constant can be tuned to zero by an appropriate choice of the brane tension and bulk cosmological constant , as in the randall - sundrum case . notice that at high energies , for which @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the five dimensional gravitational constant , the hubble rate becomes @xmath27 while in ordinary cosmology @xmath28 .",
    "the latter case is retrieved at low energy , i.e. @xmath29 of course modifications to the hubble rate can only be significant before nucleosynthesis .",
    "they may have drastic consequences on early universe phenomena such as inflation .    in this article",
    "we will review these and other aspects of the brane world idea in the context of cosmology . in order to give a pedagogical introduction to the subject",
    ", we will follow a phenomenological approach and start with the simplest model , i.e. the randall - sundrum model , with a brane embedded in a five  dimensional vacuum bulk spacetime ( section 2 ) .",
    "later we will include a bulk scalar field ( section 3 ) . in section 4",
    "we will discuss the geometry of the bulk ",
    "spacetime in some detail .",
    "in the last part we will discuss more realistic models with two branes and bulk scalar fields ( section 5 ) .",
    "in section 6 we will discuss brane collisions .",
    "open questions are summarized in section 7 .",
    "we would like to mention other review articles on brane worlds and cosmology , taking different approaches from the one taken here @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we will mostly be concerned with the case , in which the bulk space  time is five  dimensional .",
    "originally , randall and sundrum suggested a two  brane scenario in five dimensions with a highly curved bulk geometry as an explanation for the large hierarchy between the planck scale and the electroweak energy ",
    "scale @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the standard model particles live on a brane with ( constant ) negative tension , whereas the bulk is a slice of anti  de sitter ( ads ) spacetime , i.e. a space - time with a negative cosmological constant . in the bulk",
    "there is another brane with positive tension .",
    "this is the so  called randall ",
    "sundrum i ( rsi ) model .",
    "analysing the solution of einstein s equation on the positive tension brane and sending the negative tension brane to infinity , an observer confined to the positive tension brane recovers newton s law if the curvature scale of the ads is smaller than a millimeter @xcite .",
    "the higher  dimensional space is _ non  compact _ , which must be contrasted with the kaluza  klein mechanism , where all extra  dimensional degrees of freedom are compact . this one  brane model , on which we will concentrate in this section , is the so ",
    "called randall  sundrum ii ( rsii ) model .",
    "it was shown , there is a _",
    "continuum _ of kaluza ",
    "klein modes for the gravitational field , contrasting with the discrete spectrum if the extra dimension is periodic .",
    "this leads to a correction to the force between two static masses on the brane . to be specific",
    ", it was shown that the potential energy between two point masses confined on the brane is given by @xmath30 in this equation , @xmath31 is related to the five  dimensional bulk cosmological constant @xmath17 by @xmath32 and is therefore a measure of the curvature scale of the bulk spacetime .",
    "gravitational experiments show no deviation from newton s law of gravity on length scales larger than a millimeter @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath31 has to be smaller than that length scale .",
    "the static solution of the randall and sundrum model can be obtained as follows : the total action consists of the einstein - hilbert action and the brane action , which in the randall  sundrum model have the form @xmath33 the parameter @xmath17 ( the bulk cosmological constant ) and @xmath34 ( the brane tension ) are constant and @xmath35 is the five  dimensional gravitational coupling constant .",
    "the brane is located at @xmath12 and we assume a @xmath1 symmetry , i.e. we identify @xmath36 with @xmath37 .",
    "the ansatz for the metric is @xmath38 einstein s equations , derived from the action above , give two independent equations : @xmath39 the first equation can be easily solved : @xmath40 which tells us that @xmath17 must be negative .",
    "if we integrate the second equation from @xmath41 to @xmath42 , take the limit @xmath43 and make use of the @xmath1symmetry , we get @xmath44 together with eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) this tells us that @xmath45 thus , there must be a fine  tuning between the brane tension and the bulk cosmological constant for static solutions to exist . in this section",
    "we will discuss the cosmology of this model in detail .",
    "there are two ways of deriving the cosmological equations and we will describe both of them below .",
    "the first one is rather simple and makes use of the bulk equations only .",
    "the second method uses the geometrical relationship between four  dimensoinal and five  dimensional quantities .",
    "we begin with the simpler method .      in the following subsection",
    "we will set @xmath46 .",
    "we write the bulk metric as follows : @xmath47 this metric is consistent with homogeneity and isotropy on the brane located at @xmath12 .",
    "the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 are functions of @xmath50 and @xmath36 only .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed flat spatial sections , it is straightforward to include a spatial curvature . for this metric , einstein equations in the bulk read : @xmath51                  = a^2b^2\\left[\\rho_b + \\rho^ { }                  \\bar\\delta(y - y_b)\\right]\\label{g00}\\\\ a^2b^2{g^5}_5 & \\equiv&3\\left[\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}-\\frac{\\dot{a}\\dot{b}}{ab }                   -2\\frac{{a'}^2}{a^2}-\\frac{a ' b'}{ab}+kb^2\\right ]                   = -a^2b^2t^5_5 \\label{g55}\\\\ a^2b^2{g^0}_5&\\equiv&3\\left [ -\\frac{\\dot{a}'}{a}+2\\frac{\\dot{a}a'}{a^2 }                   + \\frac{\\dot{a}b'}{ab}+\\frac{a'\\dot{b}}{ab}\\right ]                   = -a^2b^2 t^0_5   \\label{g05}\\\\ a^2b^2{g^i}_j&\\equiv&\\left [ 3\\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}+\\frac{\\ddot{b}}{b}-                   \\frac{\\dot{b}^2}{b^2}-3\\frac{a''}{a}-\\frac{b''}{b }                   + \\frac{{b'}^2}{b^2}+kb^2\\right ]                   { \\delta^i}_j \\nonumber \\\\                   & = & -a^2b^2\\left[p_b+p^ { }                   \\bar{\\delta}(y - y_b)\\right]{\\delta^i}_j , \\label{gij}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the bulk energy ",

    "for the randall  sundrum model we will now take @xmath53 and @xmath54 . later , in the next section , we will use these equations to derive friedmann s equation with a bulk scalar field .",
    "in the equations above , a dot represents the derivative with respect to @xmath50 and a prime a derivative with respect to @xmath36 .",
    "let us integrate the 00component over @xmath36 from @xmath41 to @xmath55 and use the fact that @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( i.e. @xmath1-symmetry ) . then , taking the limit @xmath43 we get @xmath60 integrating the @xmath61component in the same way and using the last equation gives @xmath62 these two conditions are called the junction conditions .",
    "the other components of the einstein equations should be compatible with these conditions .",
    "it is not difficult to show that the restriction of the @xmath63 component to @xmath12 leads to @xmath64 where we have made use of the junction conditions ( [ junc1 ] ) and ( [ junc2 ] ) .",

    "if there is a small mismatch between the brane tension and the five  dimensional cosmological constant , then an effective four  dimensional cosmological constant is generated .",
    "another important point is that the four  dimensional newton constant is directly related to the brane tension .",
    "the constant @xmath76 appears in the derivation above as an integration constant .",
    "the term including @xmath76 is called the _ dark radiation _ term ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath76 can be obtained from a full analysis of the bulk equations @xcite-@xcite ( we will discuss this in section 4 )",
    ". an extended version of birkhoff s theorem tells us that if the bulk spacetime is ads , this constant is zero @xcite . if the bulk is ads  schwarzschild instead , @xmath76 is non  zero but a measure of the mass of the bulk black hole . in the following",
    "we will assume that @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the most important change in friedmann s equation compared to the usual four  dimensional form is the appearance of a term proportional to @xmath79 .",

    "this implies that @xmath85 .",
    "note , however , that a much stronger constraint arises from current tests for deviation from newton s law @xcite ( assuming the randall  sundrum fine  tuning relation ( [ finetuning ] ) ) : @xmath86 tev and @xmath87 .",
    "similarily , cosmology constrains the amount of dark radiation .",

    "we obtain einstein s equation on the brane : @xmath108 the tensor @xmath109 is defined as @xmath110 whereas @xmath111 note that in the randall  sundrum case we have @xmath75 due to the fine  tuning between the brane tension and the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "moreover @xmath112 as the weyl ",
    "tensor vanishes for an ads spacetime . in general , the energy conservation and the bianchi identities imply that @xmath113 on the brane .",
    "clearly , this method is powerful , as it does not assume homogeneity and isotropy nor does it assume the bulk to be ads . in the case of an ads bulk and a friedmann  robertson walker brane , the previous equations reduce to the friedmann equation and raychaudhuri equation derived earlier .",
    "however , the set of equations on the brane _ are not closed in general _",
    "@xcite , as we will see in the next section .",
    "we have seen that the friedmann equation on a brane is drastically modified at high energy where the @xmath79 terms dominate . as a result",
    "the early universe cosmology on branes tends to be different from standard 4d cosmology . in that vein",

    "it implies that steeper potentials can be used to drive slow ",
    "roll inflation @xcite .",
    "let us discuss the implications for cosmological perturbations .",
    "according to einstein s equation ( [ einsteinbrane ] ) , perturbations in the metric are sourced not only by matter perturbations _ but also by perturbations of the bulk geometry _ , encoded in the perturbation of @xmath119 .",
    "this term can be seen as an _ external source _ for perturbations , absent in general relativity . if one regards @xmath119 as an energy ",
    "momentum tensor of an additional fluid ( called the weyl - fluid ) , its evolution is connected to the energy density of matter on the brane , as one can see from eq .",
    "( [ weylfluid ] ) .",
    "if one neglects the anisotropic stress of the weyl - fluid , then at low energy and superhorizon scales , it decays as radiation , i.e. @xmath120 .",
    "however , the bulk gravitational field _ exerts _ an anisotropic stress onto the brane , whose time - evolution can not be obtained by considering the projected equations on the brane alone @xcite .",
    "rather , the full five  dimensional equations have to be solved , together with the junction conditions .",
    "the full evolution of @xmath119 in the different cosmological eras is currently not understood . however , as we will discuss below , partial results have been obtained for the case of a de sitter brane , which suggest that @xmath119 does not change the spectrum of scalar perturbations .",
    "it should be noted however , that the issue is not settled and that it is also not clear if the subsequent cosmological evolution during radiation and matter era leaves an imprint of the bulk gravitational field in the anisotropies of the microwave background radiation @xcite . with this in mind , we will , for scalar perturbations , neglect the gravitational backreaction described by the projected weyl tensor .    considering scalar perturbations for the moment , the perturbed line element on the brane has the form @xmath121 where the functions @xmath122 , @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 depend on @xmath50 and @xmath126 .",
    "an elegant way of discussing scalar perturbations is to make use of of the gauge invariant quantity @xcite @xmath127 in general relativity , the evolution equation for @xmath128 can be obtained from the energy ",
    "conservation equation @xcite .",
    "it reads , on large scales , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the non - adiabatic pressure perturbation .",
    "the energy conservation equation , however , holds for the randall  sundrum model as well .",
    "therefore , eq . ( [ zetaevolution ] ) is still valid for the brane world model we consider . for inflation driven by a single scalar field @xmath131 vanishes and",
    "therefore @xmath128 is constant on superhorizon scales during inflation .",
    "its amplitude is given in terms of the fluctuations in the scalar field on spatially flat hypersurfaces : @xmath132 the quantum fluctuation in the ( slow  rolling ) scalar field obey @xmath133 , as the klein ",
    "gordon equation is not modified in the brane world model we consider .",
    "the amplitude of scalar perturbations is @xcite @xmath134 . using the slow ",
    "roll equations and eq .",
    "( [ zetafield ] ) one obtains @xcite @xmath135 ^ 3     square brackets . for a given potential",
    "the amplitude of scalar perturbations is _ enhanced _ compared to the prediction of general relativity .",
    "the arguments presented so far suggest that , at least for scalar perturbations , perturbations in the bulk spacetime are not important during inflation .",
    "this , however , might not be true for tensor perturbations , as gravitational waves can propagate into the bulk . for tensor perturbations , a wave equations for a single variable",
    "can be derived @xcite .",
    "the wave equation can be separated into a four  dimensional and a five  dimensonal part , so that the solution has the form @xmath136 , where @xmath137 is a ( constant ) polarization tensor .",

    "thus , one expects in this scenario only the massless modes to survive until the end of inflation @xcite , @xcite .    from eqns .",
    "( [ tensoramplitude ] ) and ( [ scalaramplitude ] ) one sees that the amplitudes of scalar and tensor perturbations are enhanced at high energies",
    ". however , scalar perturbations are more enhanced than tensors .",
    "thus , the relative contribution of tensor perturbations will be suppressed , if inflation is driven at high energies .",
    "finally , we would like to mention that there are also differences between general relativity and the brane world model we consider for the prediction of two  field brane inflation .",
    "usually correlations are separated in adiabatic and isocurvature modes for two ",
    "field inflation @xcite . in the randall  sundrum model ,",
    "this correlation is suppressed if inflation is driven at high energies @xcite .",
    "this implies that isocurvature and adiabatic perturbations are uncorrelated , if inflation is driven at energies much larger than the brane tension .",
    "coming back to cosmological perturbations , the biggest problem is that the evaluation of the projected weyl tensor is only possible for the background cosmology .",
    "as soon as one tries to analyse the brane cosmological perturbations , one faces the possibility that the @xmath142 terms might not vanish . in particular",
    "this means that the equation for the density contrast @xmath143 , which is given by ( @xmath144 , @xmath145 is the wavenumber ) @xmath146 can not be solved as @xmath147 involves @xmath148 and can therefore not be deduced solely from the brane dynamics @xcite .",

    "we are going to generalize these results by considering the projective approach to the brane dynamics .",
    "we will first follow the traditional coordinate dependent path .",
    "this will allow us to derive the matter conservation equation , the klein - gordon and the friedmann equations on the brane .",
    "then we will concentrate on the more geometric formulation where the role of the projected weyl tensor will become transparent @xcite,@xcite . again , in this subsection we will put @xmath187 .",
    "we consider a static brane that we choose to put at the origin @xmath188 . and impose @xmath189 .",
    "this guarantees that the brane and bulk expansion rates @xmath190 coincide .",
    "we have identified the brane cosmic time @xmath191 .",
    "we will denote by prime the normal derivative @xmath192 .",
    "moreover we now allow for some matter to be present on the brane @xmath193 the bulk energy - momentum tensor reads @xmath194 the total matter density and pressure on the brane are given by @xmath195 the boundary condition for the scalar field is unchanged by the presence of matter on the brane .    the @xmath196 einstein equation leads to matter conservation @xmath197 by restricting the @xmath198 component of the einstein equations we obtain @xmath199 in units of @xmath26 .",

    "notice that retarded effects springing from the whole history of the brane and scalar field dynamics are present . in the following section we will see that these retarded effects come from the projected weyl tensor .",
    "they result from the exchange between the brane and the bulk .",
    "notice , that newton s constant depends on the value of the bulk scalar field evaluated on the brane ( @xmath204 ) : @xmath205 on cosmological scale , time variation of the scalar field induce a time variations of newton s constant .",
    "this is highly constrained experimentally @xcite,@xcite , leading to tight restrictions on the time dependence of the scalar field .    to get a feeling of the physics involved in the friedmann equation",
    ", it is convenient to assume that the scalar field is evolving slowly on the scale of the variation of the scale factor . neglecting the evolution of newton s constant",
    ", the friedmann equation reduces to @xmath206 several comments are in order .",
    "first of all we have neglected the contribution due to the @xmath207 term as we are considering energy scales below the brane tension .",
    "then the main effect of the scalar field dynamics is to involve the potential energy @xmath208 and the kinetic energy @xmath209 .",
    "although the potential energy appears with a positive sign we find that the kinetic energy has a negative sign .",
    "for an observer on the brane this looks like a violation of unitarity .",
    "we will reanalyse this issue in section 5 , when considering the low energy effective action in four dimensions and we will see that there is no unitarity problem in this theory . the minus sign for the kinetic energy is due to the fact that one does not work in the einstein frame where newton s constant does not vary , a similar minus sign appears also in the effective four  dimensional theory when working in the brane frame .",
    "the time dependence of the scalar field is determined by the klein - gordon equation .",
    "the dynamics is completely specified by @xmath210 where @xmath211 .",
    "we have identified @xmath212 this can not be set to zero and requires the knowledge of the scalar field in the vicinity of the brane .",
    "when we discuss cosmological solutions below , we will assume that this term is negligible .",
    "the evolution of the scalar field is driven by two effects .",
    "first of all , the scalar field couples to the trace of the energy momentum tensor via the gradient of @xmath213 . secondly , the field is driven by the gradient of the potential @xmath208 , which might not necessarily vanish .",
    "we are now coming back to the origin of the non - trivial friedmann equation . using the gauss - codazzi equation",
    "one can obtain the einstein equation on the brane @xcite,@xcite @xmath214 now the projected weyl tensor can be determined in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology case .",
    "indeed only the @xmath215 component is independent . using the bianchi identity @xmath216 where @xmath217 is the brane covariant derivative",
    ", one obtains that @xmath218 leading to @xmath219 upon using @xmath220 one obtains the friedmann equation .",
    "it is remarkable that the retarded effects in the friedmann equation all spring from the projected weyl tensor .",
    "hence the projected weyl tensor proves to be much richer in the case of a bulk scalar field than in the empty bulk case .",
    "the dynamics of the brane is not closed , it is an open system continuously exchanging energy with the bulk .",
    "this exchange is characterized by the dark radiation term and the loss parameter .",
    "both require a detailed knowledge of the bulk dynamics .",
    "this is of course beyond the projective approach where only quantities on the brane are evaluated . in the following",
    "we will _ assume _ that the dark radiation term is absent and that the loss parameter is negligible .",
    "furthermore , we will be interested in the effects of a bulk scalar field for late  time cosmology ( i.e. well after nucleosynthesis ) and not in the case for inflation driven by a bulk scalar field ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) .",
    "let us consider the self - tuned scenario as a solution to the cosmological constant problem .",
    "it corresponds to the bps superpotential with @xmath221 . in that case",
    "the potential @xmath222 for any value of the brane tension .",
    "the potential @xmath222 can be interpreted as a vanishing of the brane cosmological constant .",
    "the physical interpretation of the vanishing of the cosmological constant is that the brane tension curves the fifth dimensional space - time leaving a flat brane intact .",
    "unfortunately , the description of the bulk geometry in that case has shown that there was a bulk singularity which needs to be hidden by a second brane whose tension is fine - tuned with the first brane tension .",
    "this reintroduces a fine - tuning in the putative solution to the cosmological constant problem @xcite .",
    "let us generalize the selftuned case to @xmath223 , i.e. @xmath224 and @xmath184 is the exponential superpotential .",
    "the resulting induced metric on the brane is of the frw type with a scale factor @xmath225 leading to an acceleration parameter @xmath226 for the supergravity value @xmath227 this leads to @xmath228 .",
    "this is in coincidental agreement with the supernovae results .",
    "this model can serve as a _",
    "brane quintessence model _ @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we will comment on the drawbacks of this model later .",
    "see also @xcite and @xcite for similar ideas .",
    "let us now consider the possible cosmological scenarios with a bulk scalar field @xcite,@xcite .",
    "we assume that the potential energy of the scalar field @xmath208 is negligible throughout the radiation and matter eras before serving as quintessence in the recent past .",
    "at very high energy above the tension of the brane the non - conventional cosmology driven by the @xmath207 term in the friedmann equation is obtained . assuming radiation domination",
    ", the scale factor behaves like @xmath229 and the scalar field @xmath230 in the radiation dominated era , no modification is present , provided @xmath231 which is a solution of the klein - gordon equation as the trace of the energy - momentum of radiation vanishes ( together with a decaying solution , which we have neglected ) . in the matter dominated era the scalar field evolves due to the coupling to the trace of the energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "firstly , the kinetic energy of the scalar field starts contributing in the friedmann equation .",
    "secondly , the effective newton constant does not remain constant .",
    "the cosmological evolution of newton s constant is severely constrained since nucleosynthesis @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this restricts the possible time variation of @xmath232 .    in order to be more quantitative",
    "let us come back to the exponential superpotential case with a detuning parameter @xmath103 .",
    "the time dependence of the scalar field and scale factor become @xmath233 where @xmath234 and @xmath235 are the time and scale factor at matter - radiation equality .",
    "notice the slight discrepancy of the scale factor exponent with the standard model value of @xmath236 .",
    "the redshift dependence of the newton constant is @xmath237 for the supergravity model with @xmath227 and @xmath238 this leads to a decrease by ( roughly ) 37% since nucleosynthesis .",
    "this is marginally compatible with experiments @xcite,@xcite .",
    "finally let us analyse the possibility of using the brane potential energy of the scalar field @xmath208 as the source of acceleration now .",
    "we have seen that when matter is negligible on the brane , one can build brane quintessence models .",
    "we now require that this occurs only in the recent past .",
    "as can be expected , this leads to a fine - tuning problem as @xmath239 where @xmath240 is the amount of detuned tension on the brane .",
    "of course this is nothing but a reformulation of the usual cosmological constant problem .",
    "provided one accepts this fine - tuning , as in most quintessence models , the exponential model with @xmath227is a cosmological consistent quintessence model with a five dimensional origin .",
    "the main difference between a brane world model with a bulk scalar field and the randall  sundrum model is that the gravitational constant becomes time ",
    "dependent . as such it has much in common with scalar ",
    "tensor theories @xcite , but there are important differences due to the projected weyl tensor @xmath149 and its time  evolution",
    ". the bulk scalar field can play the role of the quintessence field , as discussed above , but it could also play a role in an inflationary era in the very early universe ( see e.g. @xcite-@xcite ) . in any case , the cosmology of such a system is much richer and , because of the variation of the gravitational constant , more constrained .",
    "it remains to be seen if the bulk scalar field can leave a trace in the cmb anisotropies and large scale structures ( for first results see @xcite ) .",
    "so far , we were mostly concerned with the evolution of the brane , without referring to the bulk itself . in fact , the coordinates introduced in eq .",
    "( [ metricbraneframe ] ) are a convenient choice for studying the brane itself , but when it comes to analysing the bulk dynamics and its geometry , these coordinates are not the best choice .",
    "we have already mentioned the extended birkhoff theorem in section 2 .",
    "it states that for the case of a vacuum bulk spacetime , the bulk is necessarily static , in certain coordinates . a cosmological",
    "evolving brane is then moving in that spacetime , whereas for an observer confined on the brane the motion of the brane will be seen as an expanding ( or contracting ) universe . in the case of a scalar field in the bulk ,",
    "a similar theorem is unfortunately not available , which makes the study of such systems much more complicated .",
    "we will now discuss these issues in some detail , following in particular @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we have already discussed the static background associated with bps configurations ( including the randall  sundrum case ) in the last section . here",
    "we will focus on other backgrounds for which one can integrate the bulk equations of motion .",

    "in general , the function @xmath244 and @xmath5 depend on the type of scalar field potential .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the case of a negative bulk cosmological constant where birkhoff s theorem states that the most general solution of the ( bulk ) einstein equations is given by @xmath245 , @xmath246 and @xmath247 where @xmath248 we have denoted by @xmath249 the ads scale and @xmath76 the black hole mass ( see section 2 ) .",

    "the equation of motion is determined by the junction conditions .",
    "the method will be reviewed later when a scalar field is present in the bulk .",

    "@xmath253 is the velocity of the brane measured with the proper time on the brane .",
    "this leads to the following friedmann equation @xmath254 so the brane tension leads to an effective cosmological constant @xmath255 .",
    "the curvature gives the usual term familiar from standard cosmology while the last term is the dark radiation term whose origin springs from the presence of a black - hole in the bulk . at late time",

    "theory these branes are the boundaries of the bulk spacetime @xcite . however , even from a purely phenomenological point of view there is a reason to include a second brane : the bulk singularity ( or the ads horizon ) . as we have seen in section 3 , the inclusion of a bulk scalar field often implies the presence of a naked singularity located away from the positive tension brane .",
    "the second brane which we include now should shield this singularity , so that the physical spacetime stretches between the two branes .",
    "another motivation is the hierarchy problem .",
    "randall and sundrum proposed a two brane model ( one with positive and one with negative tension ) , embedded in a five  dimensional ads spacetime . in their scenario the standard model particles",

    "it is possible to go to the einstein frame with a simple conformal transformation , in which the sign in front of the kinetic term is correct for both fields .    in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the bps system with exponential superpotential from section 3 .",
    "let us redefine the fields according to @xmath314 with @xmath315 ; and then @xmath316 a conformal transformation @xmath317 leads to the einstein frame action : @xmath318.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] note that in this frame both fields have the correct sign in front of the kinetic terms . for @xmath319 ( i.e.  the randall  sundrum case ) the @xmath200field decouples .",
    "this reflects the fact , that the bulk scalar field decouples , and the only scalar degree of freedom is the distance between the branes .",
    "one can read off the gravitational constant to be @xmath320    the matter sector of the action can be found easily : if matter lives on the branes , it `` feels '' the induced metric .",
    "that is , the action has the form @xmath321 where @xmath322 denotes the induced metric on each branes . in going to the einstein frame one gets @xmath323 where matter now couples explicitely to the fields via the functions @xmath122 and @xmath123 , which we will give below ( neglecting derivative interactions ) .",
    "the theory derived with the help of the moduli space approximation has the form of a _ multi ",
    "scalar_tensor theory , in which matter on both branes couple differently to the moduli fields .",
    "we note , that methods different from the moduli ",
    "space approximation have been used in the literature in order to obtain the low  energy effective action or the resulting field equations for a two  brane system ( see in particular @xcite@xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , the features of the resulting theories agree with the moduli  space approximation discussed above .    in the following",
    "we will discuss observational constraints imposed on the parameter of the theory .      in order to constrain the theory , it is convenient to write the moduli lagrangian in the form of a non - linear sigma model with kinetic terms @xmath324 where @xmath325 labels the moduli @xmath326 and @xmath327 .",
    "the sigma model couplings are here @xmath328 notice the potential danger of the @xmath169 limit , the rs model , where the coupling to @xmath200 becomes very small . in an ordinary brans - dicke theory with a single field",
    ", this would correspond to a vanishing brans - dicke parameter which is ruled out experimentally . here",
    "we will see that the coupling to matter is such that this is not the case .",
    "indeed we can write the action expressing the coupling to ordinary matter on our brane as @xmath329 where we have neglected the derivative interaction .",
    "let us introduce the parameters @xmath330 we find that ( @xmath331 ) @xmath332 leading to @xmath333 observations constrain the parameter @xmath334 to be less than @xmath335 @xcite .",
    "we obtain therefore a bound on @xmath336 the bound implies that @xmath337 the smallness of @xmath162 indicates a strongly warped bulk geometry such as an anti  de sitter spacetime . in the case",
    "@xmath338 , we can easily interpret the bound on @xmath5 . indeed in that case",
    "@xmath339 i.e. this is nothing but the exponential of the radion field measuring the distance between the branes .",
    "we obtain that gravity experiments require the branes to be sufficiently far apart .",
    "when @xmath340 but small , one way of obtaining a small value of @xmath5 is for the hidden brane to become close from the would - be singularity where @xmath341 .",
    "we would like to mention that the parameter @xmath305 can be calculated also for matter on the negative tension brane .",
    "then , following the same calculations as above , it can be seen that the observational constraint for @xmath305 _ can not _ be satisfied . thus ,",
    "if the standard model particles are confined on the negative tension brane , _ the moduli have necessarily to be stabilized .",
    "_ in the following we will assume that the standard model particles are confined on the positive tension brane and study the cosmological evolution of the moduli fields .",
    "the discussion in the last subsection raises an important question : the parameter @xmath162 has to be choosen rather small , in order for the theory to be consistent with observations .",
    "similarly the field @xmath5 has to be small too .",
    "the field @xmath5 is dynamical and one would like to know if the cosmological evolution drives the field @xmath5 to small values such that it is consistent with the observations today .",
    "otherwise are there natural initial conditions for the field @xmath5 ?",
    "in the following we study the cosmological evolution of the system in order to answer these questions .",
    "the field equations for a homogenous and isotropic universe can be obtained from the action .",
    "the friedmann equation reads @xmath342 where we have defined @xmath343 .",

    "we now concentrate on the case where matter is only on our brane . in the radiation dominated epoch",
    "the trace of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor vanishes , so that @xmath200 and @xmath232 quickly become constant .",
    "the scale factor scales like @xmath349 .    in the matter ",
    "dominated era , the solution to these equations is given by @xmath350 together with @xmath351 as soon as @xmath352 .",
    "note that @xmath5 indeed decays .",
    "this implies that small values of @xmath5 compatible with gravitational experiments are favoured by the cosmological evolution .",
    "note , however , that the size of @xmath5 in the early universe is constrained by nucleosynthesis as well as by the cmb anisotropies . a large discrepancy between the values of @xmath5 during nucleosynthesis and",
    "now induces a variation of the particle masses , or equivalently newton s constant , which is excluded experimentally .",
    "one can show that by putting matter on the negative tension brane as well , the field @xmath5 evolves even faster to zero @xcite .",
    "this behaviour is reminiscent of the attractor solution in scalar ",
    "tensor theories @xcite .",
    "in the five  dimensional picture the fact that @xmath5 is driven to small values means that the negative tension brane is driven towards the bulk singularity .",
    "in fact , solving the equations numerically for more general cases suggest that @xmath5 can even by negative , which is , in the five  dimensional description meaningless , as the negative tension brane would move through the bulk singularity .",
    "thus , in order to make any further progress , one has to understand the bulk singularity better the theory is equivalent to the randall  sundrum model . in this case",
    "the bulk singularity is shifted towards the anti  de sitter boundary . ] . of course",
    ", one could simply assume that the negative tension brane is destroyed when it hits the singularity .",
    "a more interesting alternative would be if the brane is repelled instead .",
    "it was speculated that this could be described by some effective potential in the low - energy effective action @xcite .",
    "we have seen that brane world models are plagued with a singularity problem : the negative tension brane might hit a bulk singularity . in that case",
    "our description of the physics on the brane requires techniques beyond the field theory approach that we have followed in this review .",
    "it is only within a unified theory encompassing general relativity and quantum mechanics that such questions might be addressed .",
    "string theory may be such a theory .",
    "the problem of the nature of the resolution of cosmological singularities in string theory is still a vastly unchartered territory .",
    "there is a second kind of singularity which arises when two branes collide .",
    "in such a case there is also a singularity in the low energy effective action as one of the extra dimensions shrink to zero size .",
    "it was speculated that brane collisions play an important role in cosmology , especially in order to understand the big bang itself @xcite-@xcite",
    ".    in heteroric m - theory the regime where the distance between the branes becomes small corresponds to the regime where the string coupling constant becomes small and therefore a perturbative heterotic treatment may be available . in particular for adiabatic processes the resulting small instanton transition has been thoroughly studied ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "here we would like to present an analysis of such a collision and of the possible outcome of such a collision .",
    "a natural and intuitive phenomenon which may occur during a collision is the existence of a cosmological bounce .",
    "such objects are not avalaible in 4d under mild assumptions , and therefore can be exhibited as a purely extra dimensional signature",
    ".    we will describe a @xmath4dimensional theory with a scalar field and gravity whose solutions present a cosmological singularity at @xmath353 .",
    "it turns out that this model is the low energy approximation of a purely @xmath354 dimensional model where the extra dimension is an interval with two boundary branes .",
    "the singularity corresponds to the brane collision . in the @xmath354 dimensional picture",
    ", one can extend the motion of the branes past each other , hence providing a continuation of the brane motion after the collision . the @xmath354 dimensional space ",
    "time is equivalent to an orbifold where the identification between space ",
    "time points is provided by a lorentz boost .",
    "these spaces are the simplest possible space  times with a singularity . as with ordinary spatial orbifolds",
    ", one may try to define string theory in such backgrounds and analyse the stringy resolution of the singularity .",
    "unfortunately , these orbifolds are not stable in general relativity ruling them out as candidate stringy backgrounds .",
    "let us now briefly outline some of the arguments .",
    "we have already investigated the moduli space approximation for models with a bulk scalar field . here",
    "we will consider that at low energy the moduli space consists of a single scalar field @xmath232 coupled to gravity @xmath355 cosmological solutions with @xmath356\\ ] ] can be easily obtained @xmath357 where @xmath358 .",
    "there are two branches corresponding to @xmath359 and @xmath360 connected by a singularity at @xmath353",
    ".    so what is the extra dimensional origin of a such a model ?",
    "one can uplift the previous system to @xmath354 dimensions by defining @xmath361 and @xmath362 where @xmath363 .",
    "consider now the purely gravitational @xmath354 dimensional theory with the metric @xmath364 where @xmath365 $ ] .",
    "the two boundaries at @xmath366 and @xmath367 are boundary branes .",
    "the dimensional reduction on the interval @xmath365 $ ] , i.e. integrating over the extra dimension , yields the effective action ( [ eff ] ) provided one restricts the two fields @xmath368 and @xmath369 to be dependent on @xmath4-dimensions only .",
    "let us now consider the nature of @xmath354 dimensional space - time obtained from the solutions ( [ sol ] ) .",
    "the @xmath354 dimensional metric becomes @xmath370 for a given @xmath123 depending on the integrations constants @xmath371 and @xmath372 .",
    "the geometry of space - time is remarkably simple .",
    "it is a direct product @xmath373 where @xmath374 is the two dimensional compactified milne space whose metric is @xmath375 using the light cone coordinates @xmath376 the metric of milne space reads @xmath377 coinciding with the two dimensional minkowski metric .",
    "there is one subtlety here , the original identification of the extra  dimensional interval is here transcribed in the fact that milne space is modded out by the boost @xmath378 as we have identified the interval with @xmath379 and the boundary branes are the fixed points of the @xmath1 action as in the randall - sundrum model .",
    "the two boundary branes collide at @xmath380 , their trajectories are given by @xmath381 at the singularity one can hope that the branes go past each other and evolve henceforth .",
    "unfortunatly , horowitz and polchinski have shown that the structure of the orbifold space - time is unstable @xcite . by considering a particle in this geometry",
    ", they showed that space ",
    "time collapses to a space - like singularity .",
    "indeed one can focus on a particle and its @xmath382th image under the orbifold action . in terms of collision",
    "the impact parameter @xmath49 becomes constant as @xmath382 grows while the centre of mass energy @xmath383 grows like @xmath384 .",
    "as soon as @xmath382 is large enough , @xmath385 the two particle approach each other within their schwarzschild radii therefore forming a black hole through gravitational collapse .",
    "so the orbifold space  time does not make sense in general relativity , i.e. not defining a time - dependent background for string theory .",
    "hence , it seems that the most simple example of brane collision needs to be modified in order to provide a working example of singularity with a meaningful string theoretic resolution .",
    "it would be extremely relevant if one could find examples of stable backgrounds of string theory where a cosmological singularity can be resolved using stringy arguments .",
    "a particularly promising avenue is provided by s ",
    "branes where a cosmological singularity is shielded by a horizon ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "time will certainly tell which of these approaches could lead to a proper understanding of cosmological singularities and their resolutions , an issue highly relevant to brane cosmology both in the early universe and the recent past .",
    "in this article we have reviewed different aspects of brane cosmology in a hopefully pedagogical manner reflecting our own biased point of view .",
    "let us finally summarize some of the open questions .",
    "* in the case of the single brane model by randall & sundrum , the homogeneous cosmological evolution is well understood .",
    "an unsolved issue in this model , however , is a complete understanding of the evolution of cosmological perturbations .",
    "the effects of the bulk gravitational field , encoded in the projected weyl ",
    "tensor , on cmb physics and large scale structures are not known .",
    "the problem is twofold : first , the bulk equation are partial , non  linear differential equations and second , boundary conditions on the brane have to be imposed .",
    "the current formalism have not yet been used in order to tackle these problems ( for perturbations in brane world theories , see @xcite-@xcite ; a short review on brane world perturbations is given in @xcite ) .",
    "* models with bulk scalar fields : although we have presented some results on the cosmological evolution of a homogeneous brane , we assumed that the bulk scalar field does not strongly vary around the brane .",
    "clearly , this needs to be investigated in some detail through a detailed investigation of the bulk equations , presumably with the help of numerical methods .",
    "furthermore , for models with two branes , the cosmology has to be explored also in the high energy regime , in which the moduli  space approximation is not valid .",
    "some exact cosmological solutions have been found in @xcite and @xcite . *",
    "both the bulk scalar field as well as the interbrane distance in two brane models could play an important role at least during some part of the cosmological history .",
    "maybe one of the fields plays the role of dark energy . in that case , it is only natural that masses of particles vary , as well as other parameter , such as the fine structure constant @xmath386 @xcite .",
    "details of this interesting proposal have yet to be worked out . *",
    "the bulk singularity , which was thought to be shielded away with the help of a second brane , seems to play an important role in a cosmological setting .",
    "we have seen in section 5 that the negative tension brane moves towards the bulk singularity and eventually hits it .",
    "therefore , cosmology forces us to think about this singularity , even if it was shielded with a second brane .",
    "cosmologically , the brane might be repelled , which might be described by a potential .",
    "alternatively , one might take quantum corrections into account in form of a gauss - bonnett term in the bulk @xcite-@xcite .",
    "* brane collisions provide a different singularity problem in brane cosmology .",
    "string theory has to make progress in order to understand this singularity as well . from the cosmological point of view",
    ", the question is , if a transition between the brane collision can provide a new cosmological era and how cosmological perturbations evolve before and after the bounce @xcite-@xcite .",
    "these aspects of brane cosmology raise very interesting questions .",
    "it is clear that cosmology will continue to play an important role for testing our ideas beyond the standard model of particle physics .",

    "<S> we begin our review with the simplest consistent brane world model : a single brane embedded in a five  dimensional anti - de sitter space  time . </S>",
    "<S> then we include a scalar field in the bulk and discuss in detail the difference with the anti - de sitter case . the geometry of the bulk space  </S>",
    "<S> time is also analysed in some depth . finally , we investigate the cosmology of a system with two branes and a bulk scalar field . </S>",
    "<S> we comment on brane collisions and summarize some open problems of brane world cosmology . </S>"
