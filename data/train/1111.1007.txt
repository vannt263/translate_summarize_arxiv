    "nearly 20 years of concerted radial - velocity monitoring of solar - type main - sequence stars has unveiled a fascinating diversity of planets and planetary system configurations . from the many hundreds of planets",
    "now characterised , the observational evidence is mounting for several interesting relationships between the properties of planets and their host stars . among these",
    "are : ( 1 ) giant planet occurrence is positively correlated with stellar metallicity @xcite and mass @xcite , ( 2 ) short - period `` super - earths '' with m  sin  @xmath410  are about an order of magnitude more common than close - in giant planets @xcite , and ( 3 ) planet mass is positively correlated with host star mass @xcite .",
    "most of the stars which have been targeted by radial - velocity surveys have masses which fall in the range 0.7 - 1.3  @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the technical requirements of doppler exoplanetary detection , which demand that stars be cool enough to present an abundance of spectral lines , and rotate slowly enough that their absorption lines are not significantly broadened by rotation .",
    "stars of lower mass ( e.g.  m dwarfs ) are intrinsically faint in the optical , making the acquisition of high signal - to - noise spectra extremely expensive in telescope time @xcite .",
    "main sequence stars of higher mass have few usable absorption lines ( due to their high temperatures ) , and also tend to be fast rotators ( @xmath5 50 ; galland et al .  2005 ) due to their youth .",
    "in addition , the shorter main - sequence lifetimes of higher - mass stars means that they will preferentially be observed at younger ages .",
    "stars earlier than about f7 also have much shallower convection zones , and so do not experience the magnetic braking which slows the rotation of later - type ( lower - mass ) stars . as a result , only the most massive planets can be detected orbiting a and f dwarfs .",
    "it is only recently that a significant number of planetary systems have been discovered orbiting intermediate - mass stars ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "these stars have proven to be a fertile hunting ground for interesting planetary systems , such as the 4:3 mean - motion resonant planets orbiting hd  200964 @xcite .",
    "now , some headway is beginning to be made in addressing the crucial question of how planet formation depends on stellar mass @xcite .",
    "a number of surveys are seeking to expand our knowledge of planetary systems orbiting stars more massive than the sun , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these surveys are exploiting the advantage wrought by stellar evolution : as stars evolve off the main sequence into subgiants and giants , their atmospheres expand and cool , making precision doppler velocity measurements possible due to an abundance of narrow spectral lines .",
    "the well - known planet - metallicity correlation @xcite , whereby main - sequence stars with higher metal content are more likely to host planets , has come under some scrutiny .",
    "analysis of the metallicities of planet - hosting giant stars by @xcite showed that the giant star planet hosts were significantly more metal - poor than their main - sequence counterparts .",
    "@xcite have also argued that the planet - metallicity correlation does not apply for evolved stars .",
    "they propose that this is evidence for a `` pollution '' scenario , in which main - sequence stars hosting planets appear metal - rich because they have accreted material from the protoplanetary disk @xcite .",
    "when a star evolves off the main sequence , the convective zone increases in size by about a factor of 35 @xcite .",
    "if the high metallicities observed in planet hosts are due to pollution , this expansion of the convective zone will significantly dilute the extent of that pollution , and the subgiant s photosphere would return to its `` birth '' metallicity .",
    "hence , one would _ not _ expect a significant correlation between metallicity and planet frequency for subgiants",
    ".    however , the importance of planet pollution was downplayed even by the authors who proposed it , as they felt it should play only a minor role in shaping the planet - metallicity correlation seen in dwarf stars .",
    "further , valenti & fischer  ( 2008 ) , johnson et al .",
    "2010a , takeda et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and others found no evidence of a decreasing planet - metallicity correlation among f dwarfs , subgiants or k giants .",
    "the sample of k giants studied by @xcite had a limited metallicity range , with [ fe / h]@xmath6 .",
    "examination of the form of the planet - metallicity correlation of @xcite and @xcite shows that , for small numbers of stars , the correlation over this metallicity range would look approximately flat .    one way to test",
    "this is to search for planets around a sample of evolved stars that are unambiguously metal rich .",
    "@xcite pointed out that stars on the red - edge of the subgiant branch represent such a population . here , we introduce a new southern hemisphere survey , the `` pan - pacific planet search , '' which uses the 3.9-metre anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) to search for planets among these evolved , metal - rich stars to test for evidence of planet pollution .    in this paper , we present the first result from this new survey : the detection of a 2.6  planet orbiting the nearby evolved star hd  47205 . in section  2",
    ", we introduce the pan - pacific planet search and give a complete target list for the survey .",
    "section  3 describes the observational data and gives the stellar parameters for 7  cma . in section  4",
    ", we detail the orbit - fitting process and present the planetary parameters .",
    "finally , in section  5 we discuss the further implications of this discovery .",
    "the pan - pacific planet search ( ppps ) originated as a southern hemisphere extension of the established lick & keck observatory survey for planets orbiting northern `` retired a stars '' @xcite .",
    "this program is using the 3.9 m anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) to observe a metal - rich sample of southern hemisphere subgiants .",
    "we have selected 170 southern stars with the following criteria : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 . by requiring @xmath10 ,",
    "we extend the red limit of the @xcite survey to the colours that stellar models indicate will be dominated by metal - rich subgiants @xcite .",
    "this aims to deliver improved planetary detection statistics at [ fe / h]@xmath110.0 . in light of the observed positive correlation between stellar metallicity and planet occurrence ,",
    "this should also deliver a roughly equivalent number of planetary detections to that obtained at lick and keck , though for metal - rich hosts . at the same time , by requiring @xmath12 , we exclude giant - branch stars , as these have significant intrinsic velocity noise ( `` jitter '' ) due to random convective motion and pulsations @xcite  typically about 20  @xcite .",
    "our target list includes about 30 stars from the lick survey ; this overlap will serve as a check on the systematics between the two telescopes .",
    "together , the three telescopes are observing more than 600 stars .",
    "the complete ppps target list is given in table  [ targetlist ] .",
    "observing time is scheduled such that each target should receive 46 observations per year .",
    "this strategy would appear to reduce the probability of detecting shorter - period planets ( @xmath1350 days ) , which require more densely - sampled observations in continuous blocks of time @xcite .",
    "however , we note that the same scheduling has been used in the lick and keck survey , which has detected the @xmath14 day planet orbiting hd  102956 @xcite . by employing this strategy , we are able to target more stars with a fixed amount of observing time , which should increase the probability of detecting the types of planets which are known to orbit nearly 20% of these types of stars @xcite .",
    "ppps doppler measurements are made with the ucles echelle spectrograph @xcite at the 3.9-metre anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) .",
    "ucles achieves a resolution of 45,000 with a 1-arcsecond slit .",
    "an iodine absorption cell provides wavelength calibration from 5000 to 6200 .",
    "the spectrograph point - spread function and wavelength calibration are derived from the iodine absorption lines embedded on every pixel of the spectrum by the cell @xcite .",
    "the result is a precision doppler velocity estimate for each epoch , along with an internal uncertainty estimate , which includes the effects of photon - counting uncertainties , residual errors in the spectrograph psf model , and variation in the underlying spectrum between the iodine - free template , and epoch spectra observed through the iodine cell .",
    "the photon - weighted mid - time of each exposure is determined by an exposure meter .",
    "all velocities are measured relative to the zero - point defined by the template observation .",
    "velocities are obtained using the _ austral _ code as first discussed in @xcite .",
    "_ austral _ is a proven doppler code which has been used by the mcdonald observatory planet search programs for nearly 10 years ( e.g.  endl et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ; wittenmyer et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "observations for the ppps began at the anglo - australian telescope in 2009 february .",
    "since its inception , the program has received 20 nights per year , of which approximately 50% have resulted in usable data .",
    "we aim for a signal - to - noise ( s / n ) of 100 at 5500  per spectral pixel each epoch , resulting in exposure times ranging from 100s up to a maximum of 20 minutes .",
    "we have observed 7  cma on 21 epochs , and an iodine - free template observation was obtained on 2010 jan 30 . since 7",
    "cma is an extremely bright star , exposure times ranged from 100 to 500 s , with a resulting s / n of @xmath15200 - 300 per pixel each epoch .",
    "the data span a total of 917 days , and have a mean internal velocity uncertainty of 6.5 .",
    "7 cma ( = hd  47205 , hip  31592 ) is one of the brightest stars in the ppps survey ( @xmath16 ) . in addition , it is accessible from most sites in both hemispheres ( ra : 063641.038 , dec : -191521.17 ) , and so it has been well - studied .",
    "table  [ stellarparams ] summarises the physical parameters of this star .",
    "we have used our iodine - free template spectrum to derive spectroscopic stellar parameters , using methods described fully in @xcite . in brief , 7",
    "cma is an evolved , somewhat metal - rich ( [ fe / h]@xmath150.2 ) , intermediate - mass star ( 1.52 ) with a low level of activity .",
    "_ hipparcos _ observations indicate that it is photometrically stable , with a median _ hipparcos _ magnitude of 4.1200@xmath00.0004 @xcite .",
    "the aat data show a root - mean - square ( rms ) scatter of 29.5  about the mean velocity .",
    "visual investigation of the data after two years of observation revealed a clear sinusoidal trend . due to the relative paucity of data points ( @xmath17 ) compared to typical radial - velocity planet detections ( @xmath18 ) , the traditional periodogram approach does not produce reliable estimates of statistical significance .",
    "rather , since the periodic signal is readily apparent by eye , we used a genetic algorithm @xcite to determine keplerian orbital parameters .",
    "those parameters were then used as initial inputs for a standard least - squares fitting routine .",
    "our previous experience with genetic algorithms @xcite has shown that the solution `` evolves '' quite rapidly toward a sharp @xmath19 minimum when brought to bear on data containing a real and coherent keplerian signal . indeed , with an allowed period range of 600 - 800 days , the algorithm converged on a solution with a period of 769 days and a small eccentricity @xmath20 .",
    "we then used the _ gaussfit _",
    "code @xcite to obtain a keplerian model fit for the planet . for the final orbit",
    "fitting , we added 5  of jitter in quadrature to the internal uncertainties of the data shown in table  [ aatvels ] .",
    "the jitter estimate of 5  is derived from @xcite . in that work , 382 velocity measurements from 72 stable stars in the lick and keck survey of `` retired a stars '' were used to make an empirical jitter estimate which was then applied to the seven planet - host stars described therein .",
    "it would be ideal to estimate jitter for ppps stars using the same methodology , but at this time , we have insufficient data on radial - velocity stable stars to make a statistically meaningful estimate .",
    "this is due to the short time baseline ( 2.5  yr ) and limited available data on a smaller number of stars in the ppps as compared to the well - established lick & keck survey .",
    "however , we consider the 5  jitter estimate to be a reasonable approximation for ppps targets due to the similarity in physical properties to the @xcite sample .",
    "we also note that there is substantial ( @xmath2150% ) uncertainty in the estimation of radial - velocity jitter @xcite .    using a stellar mass of 1.52@xmath00.30",
    ", we estimate the minimum mass m  sin  @xmath2 to be 2.6@xmath00.6 .",
    "the fit is shown in figure  [ planetfit ] and the planetary parameters are given in table  [ planetparams ] .",
    "the residuals of the fit show no evidence for additional signals ( figure  [ periodograms ] ) . as a further test of the veracity of the planet fit",
    ", we used the `` scrambled velocity '' approach of @xcite .",
    "this technique serves to test the null hypothesis that the observed velocity variation is attributable to noise . for this test",
    ", we scramble the velocities amongst the observation epochs , creating 5000 shuffled data sets .",
    "then , we perform the same least - squares keplerian orbit - fitting on the shuffled data and log the resulting best - fit @xmath19",
    ". the results of these trials are shown in figure  [ shuffle ]  not one of the scrambled data sets achieved a better @xmath19 than the planet fit to our original data .",
    "we thus conclude that there is a less than 0.02% probability that the detected signal arose by chance from noise .",
    "since many k  giants have intrinsic radial - velocity variations with periods of hundreds of days @xcite , it is prudent for us to further examine the planet hypothesis for 7  cma to ensure that the observed velocity variations are not associated with known activity and rotational cycles .",
    "the first and simplest test is to combine the available estimates of the star s radius and v  sin  @xmath2 minimum rotational velocity to obtain a maximum rotation period . using the values for these quantities given in table  [ stellarparams ]",
    ", this yields a maximum @xmath22 days ( for v  sin  @xmath2=1.0 , massarotti et al .",
    "unfortunately , neither estimate of v  sin  @xmath2 has an uncertainty , but if we apply a typical uncertainty of 1 , then maximum rotation periods shorter than 776 days fall within the 1@xmath23 range .    for a spotted star , the rotation period can be deduced from photometry .",
    "a periodogram of the _ hipparcos _ photometry ( after removing one outlier which was more than 1 magnitude discrepant ) is shown in figure  [ hipp ] .",
    "two peaks are evident at periods of 12.2 and 103.7 days .",
    "we estimate the false - alarm probability using the bootstrap randomization method @xcite .",
    "the bootstrap method randomly shuffles the observations while keeping the times of observation fixed .",
    "the periodogram of this shuffled data set is then computed and its highest peak recorded .",
    "from 10,000 such realizations , we find a false - alarm probability of 2.5% for the peak at 12.2 days , and 3.2% for that at 103.7 days . at the 763-day period of the candidate planet ,",
    "the bootstrap false - alarm probability is 98.7% .",
    "the amplitude of the photometric variations for either of the two marginally significant periods is 20@xmath24 mag . in any case , if these small photometric variations are due to the star s rotation , their periodicities are clearly well - separated from that of the candidate planet .",
    "one can argue that the absence of significant variations in the _ hipparcos _ photometry on the 763-day period is not a complete refutation of the starspot hypothesis .",
    "stars have activity cycles , and so there is the possibility that the activity of 7  cma was at a minimum during the _ hipparcos _ observations ( 20 years before the radial - velocity observations ) , but is now at a maximum which , if the rotation period were as long as @xmath15763 days , could mimic the signal of an orbiting planet .",
    "line bisector analysis is a fairly common technique used by some planet - search programs ( e.g.  harps ) to make sure a signal is not due to stellar activity .",
    "such analysis has the advantage of being contemporaneous with the velocity measurements .",
    "we note that for the radial - velocity programs using aat / ucles , spectra are of relatively low resolution ( @xmath25 ) and nearly all of the usable spectral range is superimposed with iodine lines .",
    "we have computed the bisector velocity spans for 8 strong unblended lines redward of the iodine region .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ bisectors ] ; each point represents the mean bisector velocity span of 8 lines , and its uncertainty is the standard deviation about the mean value . while the uncertainties are large , it is evident from figure  [ bisectors ] that the bisector velocity spans are uncorrelated with the radial velocities .",
    "furthermore , the right panel of figure  [ bisectors ] shows a periodogram of the bisector velocity spans , which also indicates no periodicity near the 763-day period of the planet .",
    "these independent lines of evidence thus lead us to conclude that the radial - velocity variations observed in 7  cma are attributible not to an intrinsic stellar process , but to an orbiting giant planet .      using the anglo - australian telescope ,",
    "we have begun a southern hemisphere search for planets orbiting evolved , intermediate - mass stars .",
    "our pan - pacific planet search team members are based in australia , china , and the us ; we now report the first planet detection from our ongoing survey .",
    "there is an emerging trend that planets orbiting intermediate - mass stars tend to have higher masses and longer periods that planets orbiting solar - mass stars @xcite . with a period of 2.1 years and a minimum mass of 2.6 ,",
    "7  cma  b is quite similar to other planets known to orbit intermediate - mass stars .",
    "figure  [ compare ] shows the mass and period distribution of all radial - velocity detected planets known to orbit stars with @xmath3 , with 7  cma  b plotted as a large filled triangle .",
    "given the abundance of planets with @xmath262yr known to orbit these types of stars , we anticipate that 7  cma  b is the first of many planet detections to come from the ppps .",
