    "recent theoretical studies of the falicov - kimball model ( fkm )  @xcite showed that although this model is relatively simple , it can yield the correct physics for describing rare - earth and transition metal compounds  @xcite .",
    "the model is based on the coexistence of two different types of electronic states in given materials : localized , highly correlated ionic - like states and extended , uncorrelated , bloch - like states .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is given by sum of three terms @xmath0    the first term of ( 1 ) is the kinetic energy corresponding to quantum mechanical hopping of the itinerant @xmath1 electrons between sites @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "usually it is assumed that @xmath4 if @xmath2 and @xmath3 are nearest neighbors and zero otherwise ( the conventional fkm ) , however , in what follows we consider a much more realistic type of hopping , so for the moment we leave it as arbitrary .",
    "the second term represents the coulomb interaction between @xmath5 electrons with density @xmath6 and @xmath1 electrons with density @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the number of lattice sites .",
    "the last term stands for the localized @xmath5 electrons whose sharp energy level is @xmath9 .",
    "one can see , that the interaction term in the conventional fkm includes only the local interactions and all nonlocal interactions are neglected .",
    "it is interesting to ask , however , if these nonlocal interactions are really unimportant and can be neglected or not .",
    "the possible improvement of the conventional fkm , which take into account also nonlocal interactions between nearest neighbors , is so - called correlated hopping term that describes how the occupancy of @xmath5 orbitals influences the hopping probability of @xmath1 electrons : @xmath10 the importance of the correlated hopping term has already been mentioned by hubbard  @xcite .",
    "later hirsch  @xcite pointed out that this term may be relevant in the explanation of superconducting properties of strongly correlated electrons .",
    "the effect of correlated hopping on the ground - state properties of the fkm has been examined recently by gajek and lemaski in 1d @xmath11 as well as wojtkiewicz and lemaski in two dimensions @xmath12 .",
    "the same subject has been studied in our previous papers  @xmath13 . using finite - cluster diagonalization calculations",
    "we have showed that the picture of valence and metal - insulator transitions is dramatically changed if the term of correlated hopping is included .",
    "one of the most important results found for the one - dimensional fkm with correlated hopping was that the correlated hopping can induce the insulator - metal transition , even in the half - filled band case @xmath14  @xmath15 , where the ground state of the conventional fkm is insulating for all coulomb interactions @xmath16 . in the present paper we go beyond this case and examine a more general point @xmath17 , that is the point of the special interest for valence and metal - insulator transitions caused by promotion of electrons from localized @xmath5 orbitals @xmath18 to the conduction band states .",
    "since in the spinless version of the fkm ( 1 ) with correlated hopping ( 2 ) the @xmath5  -  electron occupation number @xmath19 of each site @xmath2 commutes with the hamiltonian , the @xmath5-electron occupation number is a good quantum number , taking only two values : @xmath20 or 0 , according to whether or not the site @xmath2 is occupied by the localized @xmath5  electron .",
    "therefore the hamiltonian of the fkm with correlated hopping can be rewritten as    @xmath21    where @xmath22 and    @xmath23    thus for a given @xmath5-electron configuration @xmath24 the hamiltonian ( 3 ) is the second - quantized version of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath25 , so the investigation of the model ( 3 ) is reduced to the investigation of the spectrum of @xmath26 for different configurations of @xmath5 electrons .",
    "this can be performed exactly ( over the full set of @xmath5-electron configurations ) or approximatively ( over the incomplete set , but still kipping the high precision of calculations ) .",
    "here we adopt the second method since it allows us to treat several times larger lattices and so to minimize finite - size effects .",
    "the method used in this paper to study effects of correlated hopping on ground - state properties of the fkm is a simple modification of the finite - cluster exact - diagonalization method .",
    "this method was used firstly by one of us to describe the ground - state phase diagram ( in @xmath9 - @xmath27 plane ) of the conventional fkm in one and two dimensions @xmath28 .",
    "it was shown that the method is able to reproduce satisfactorily the exact results even after a relatively small number of iterations for both , one and two dimensions .",
    "the method is relatively simple and consists of the following steps : ( i ) chose a trial configuration @xmath29 .",
    "( ii ) having @xmath30 , @xmath27 , @xmath31 and @xmath9 fixed , find all eigenvalues @xmath32 of @xmath33 .",
    "( iii ) for a given @xmath34 determine the ground - state energy @xmath35 of a particular @xmath5-electron configuration @xmath30 by filling in the lowest @xmath36 one - electron levels .",
    "( iv ) generate a new configuration @xmath37 by moving a randomly chosen electron to a new position which is chosen also at random .",
    "( v ) calculate the ground - state energy @xmath38 .",
    "if @xmath39 the new configuration is accepted , otherwise @xmath37 is rejected .",
    "then the steps ( ii)-(v ) are repeated until the convergence ( for given @xmath27 and @xmath9 ) is reached .",
    "of course , one can move instead of one electron ( in step ( iv ) ) two or more electrons , the convergence of the method can thereby be improved .",
    "indeed , tests that we have performed for a wide range of the model parameters showed that the latter implementation of the method , in which @xmath40 electrons ( @xmath41 should be chosen at random ) are moved to new positions , overcomes better the local minima of the ground - state energy .",
    "this also improves the accuracy of the method .",
    "moreover , we have found that the method convergence depends sensitively on model parameters and selected values of @xmath42 .",
    "thus the first step in our numerical calculations was to find the optimum value of @xmath42 for the intermediate interactions , the case studied in this paper .",
    "in particular , we have tested the convergence of method for @xmath43 and four selected values of @xmath42 , and namely , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the results of numerical calculations are summarized in fig .  1 , where the quantity @xmath46 ( the minimal number of iterations for which the exact ground state for given @xmath8 is reached ) is plotted as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "it is seen , that selected @xmath42 strongly influence the method convergence , especially for large @xmath8 , where the cases @xmath48 and @xmath49 need several times larger number of iterations than the cases @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "therefore , we chose the case @xmath50 for the numerical calculations in the intermediate region .",
    "the main aim of this paper is to answer the question , how the correlated hopping influences ground - state properties of the one - dimensional fkm in the symmetric case ( @xmath52 ) . in particular , the influence of @xmath31 on valence transitions and conducting properties of the model was studied .",
    "we present results for two selected values of the coulomb repulsion interaction , namely @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the value @xmath55 represents the typical behavior of the system for weak interactions and the value @xmath43 represents the behavior of the system for intermediate and strong interactions .",
    "the ground states were studied exactly on the finite clusters consisting of @xmath56 and @xmath57 lattice sites , while for larger lattices ( up to @xmath58 ) the approximate method , discussed above , was used .",
    "it is well - known , that the @xmath5-electron density ( @xmath59 ) for the symmetric fkm without correlated hopping is equal to @xmath60 and the system is an insulator for all @xmath61 @xmath16 .",
    "it is interesting to ask , if the non - zero correlated hopping can change this picture .",
    "+ @xmath62 + to examine the influence of correlated hopping on the valence transition we have performed an exhaustive study of the model on finite clusters ( up to @xmath63 ) for @xmath31 ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 with step @xmath66 .",
    "results of numerical calculations are displayed in fig .  2 for three selected clusters ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) and",
    "they clearly demonstrate the strong effects of correlated hopping on the valence transitions . for each of these lattices",
    "@xmath59 exhibits the same characteristic features : ( i ) on the interval @xmath69 $ ] the @xmath5-electron concentration is equal to @xmath70 ( like for the conventional fkm ) .",
    "( ii ) below @xmath71 the @xmath5-electron occupation number increases . ( iii ) above @xmath72 the @xmath5-electron density rapidly falls down from @xmath73 to @xmath74 and then gradually increases . due to the fact that we have considered finite ( although relatively large ) lattices the valence transitions have a stair - case structure , which is gradually suppressed with increasing @xmath8 , of course with the exception of the stair at @xmath72 that seems to be independent of @xmath8 .",
    "a detailed analysis showed ( see fig .",
    "2d ) that the valence transition from @xmath75 to @xmath76 is not discontinuous , but it is realized through the consecutive intermediate - valence transitions ( on the interval @xmath77 $ ] ) followed by continuous changes of @xmath59 ( @xmath78 ) for @xmath79 .",
    "the similar behavior was observed also for negative @xmath31 ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "moreover , our numerical results showed that there are three critical values of @xmath31 where @xmath59 changes its character . for negative values of correlated hopping",
    "@xmath81 was observed . for @xmath82 two critical values of correlated hopping @xmath83 and @xmath84",
    "were found .",
    "the numerical results showed that the ground state between @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the alternating configuration .",
    "for @xmath87 the ground states are the segregated configurations with different @xmath45 . between @xmath86 and @xmath88",
    "a few configuration types are stable :    * the most homogeneous configurations with @xmath89 . * the mixtures of the alternating configuration ( @xmath90 ) and the empty configuration ( @xmath91 ) . * the mixtures of the empty configuration ( @xmath91 ) and some periodic configurations ( @xmath92 ) ( e.g. @xmath93 ) .",
    "* around the boundary of two configuration types @xmath94 , @xmath95 mixtures @xmath96 are observed .    the ground - state configurations for @xmath97 but near @xmath85 are the most homogeneous configurations with @xmath98 and for smaller values of @xmath31 there are the mixtures of the alternating configuration ( @xmath90 ) and the fully occupied configuration ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "lastly , mixtures of periodic configurations and the alternating configuration ( @xmath100 ) are observed .    since the ground states of the fkm with correlated hopping consist of configurations",
    "which are different from the alternating configuration ( that is the ground state for the conventional fkm ) it is natural to expect that the correlated hopping will change also the conducting properties of the model . to verify this conjecture",
    "the energy gap ( @xmath101 ) at the fermi level was calculated for different finite clusters .",
    "3 shows the energy gap on the interval @xmath102 $ ] for two clusters of @xmath103 and @xmath104 sites at @xmath55 . in the region where the alternating phase is the ground state the gap @xmath105 has a finite value ( @xmath106 ) independent of @xmath8 , and",
    "so the system is an insulator .",
    "this conclusion is identical with the conventional fkm ( @xmath107 ) . at @xmath108",
    "the energy gap changes from @xmath106 to @xmath109 for both examined lattices ( the inset in fig .  3 ) .",
    "the detailed analysis showed that the most homogeneous configurations are the ground states for @xmath31 between @xmath110 and @xmath111 where @xmath109 .",
    "the extrapolation of the finite - cluster results to the thermodynamic limit at @xmath112 confirmed , that the energy gap has a finite value for @xmath113 and the system is really an insulator in this region ( fig .",
    "4 ) . on fig .  4",
    "we plotted also extrapolated results for three other positive values of @xmath31 ( @xmath114 and @xmath65 ) .",
    "their fits obviously converge to zero ( the metallic state ) indicating that the correlated hopping induces the insulator - metal transition at @xmath111 . to find the complete picture of metal - insulator transitions in the fkm with correlated hopping",
    "we have performed also an exhaustive study of the model for a wide region of negative values of @xmath31 ( @xmath115 $ ] ) . a similar behavior of the model has been observed .",
    "for @xmath31 between @xmath116 and @xmath117 , where the ground states are the most homogeneous configurations , the energy gap has a finite value @xmath109 , while for @xmath31 between @xmath118 and @xmath116 the energy gap vanishes in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .  5 , where the energy gap @xmath105 is plotted for several values of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath47 .",
    "the comprehensive picture of insulator - metal transitions in the thermodynamic limit obtained from extrapolated behaviors is displayed in fig .",
    "6 and clearly demonstrates that the correlated hopping dramatically changes the conducting properties of the model .",
    "in addition to an insulating phase , which characterizes the conventional fkm , the large metallic phases are found for the fkm with correlated hopping . the metallic phases are observed for positive and also for negative @xmath31 . for @xmath82 there",
    "exists the wide metallic region above @xmath111 and for @xmath119 there exists the wide metallic region , between @xmath118 and @xmath116 . for positive as well as negative",
    "@xmath31 the transition from the insulating to metallic phase realizes through two discontinuous transitions .",
    "the first is the insulator - insulator transition from @xmath106 to @xmath109 and the second is the insulator - metal transition from @xmath109 to @xmath120 .",
    "unfortunately , we were not able to determine the type of transition ( continuous or discontinuous ) at @xmath121 .",
    "the finite - size effects near this transition point are still large , and so it was very difficult to do definite conclusions concerning the transition type .",
    "our results only indicate that the transition at @xmath118 is probably continuous .",
    "+ @xmath122 + the same procedure as for @xmath55 has been used also for @xmath43 . as was mentioned above this value",
    "represents the typical behavior of the system for intermediate and strong interactions .",
    "again we have performed a study of the model on finite clusters ( up to l = 60 ) for @xmath31 running from @xmath64 to @xmath65 with step @xmath66 .",
    "7a shows the valence transition for the cluster with @xmath123 sites , which qualitatively describes @xmath59 for this interaction case .",
    "it is seen , that the valence transition has a similar character as for @xmath55 . in particular",
    ", there exists the region ( between @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) , where the @xmath5-occupation number is constant and equal to @xmath60 .",
    "below @xmath85 the @xmath5-electron occupation number increases from @xmath126 , and above @xmath86 the @xmath5-electron density rapidly falls down from @xmath73 to @xmath127 and then gradually increases , similarly as for @xmath55 .",
    "however , there is one important difference . the detailed analysis performed on finite clusters up to @xmath63 showed , that the valence transition at @xmath86 changes discontinuously from @xmath73 to @xmath128 .",
    "moreover , comparing the valence transitions for @xmath55 and @xmath43 one can see , that the stronger coulomb interaction needs the larger @xmath31 ( in the absolute value ) to change the ground state from @xmath129 to another @xmath59 .",
    "also for this case , we have tried to describe the ground - state configurations .",
    "although the phase diagram is very complex we were able to describe the basic configuration types . between @xmath85 and @xmath86",
    "the alternating configuration is the ground state for all investigated lattices .",
    "for @xmath130 the ground states are the segregated configurations with different @xmath45 .",
    "below @xmath85 we were able to specify several configuration types with the significant stability regions .",
    "in particular :    * the most homogeneous configurations with different @xmath98 . * the mixtures of the alternating configuration ( @xmath90 ) and the fully occupied configurations ( @xmath99 ) of different length . * the mixtures of the alternating configuration ( @xmath90 ) and periodic configurations ( @xmath92 ) .    to calculate the energy gap for @xmath43 the same procedure ,",
    "the extrapolation of finite - cluster calculations ( up to @xmath58 ) , was used .",
    "the extrapolated values of the energy gap are plotted in fig .",
    "7b as a function of @xmath31 . comparing the energy gaps for @xmath55 and @xmath43 ( fig .  6 and fig .",
    "7b ) , one can see that they exhibit qualitatively same behaviors .",
    "in particular , there is the wide insulating region around @xmath107 , two wide metallic regions ( one for positive and one for negative @xmath31 ) and the insulating region below the metallic one for negative @xmath31 . on the other hand",
    ", the careful analysis showed one important difference between the case @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "namely , for @xmath43 and @xmath82 the system undergoes discontinuous insulator - metal transition from @xmath106 to @xmath120 , while for @xmath55 the system undergoes two discontinuous transitions ( the insulator - insulator transition from @xmath106 to @xmath109 and the insulator - metal transition from @xmath109 to @xmath120 ) .",
    "moreover , one can see that with increasing @xmath27 the metallic regions shift to larger values ( in the absolute value ) of correlated hopping .    thus we can conclude that the correlated hopping @xmath31 plays the crucial role in description of the ground - state properties of the spinless fkm in 1d .",
    "the non - zero values of @xmath31 substantially change the valence transitions as well as the conducting properties of the model ( in comparison with the conventional fkm ) . for the valence transitions",
    "it was found that the relatively small values of @xmath31 can induce the large changes of @xmath59 and these changes can be continuous as well as discontinuous .",
    "however , the most important result is that the correlated hopping can induce the insulator - metal transitions in the fkm for both positive and negative values of @xmath31 .",
    "these results clearly show that the correlated hopping strongly influences the ground - state properties of the fkm and so it should not be neglected in the correct description of real materials with correlated electrons . of course , to do a direct comparison with experimental measurements one has to study fkm with correlated hopping in large dimensions .",
