    "theoretical interest in the rare decay @xmath6 as a test of the standard model has been renewed by the experimental results of the cleo collaboration @xcite .",
    "the viability of calculating the relevant hadronic matrix elements on the lattice was first demonstrated by bernard , hsieh and soni  @xcite in 1991 .",
    "the computational details and results of this work have been described in references  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the hadronic matrix elements can be parametrised by three form factors , @xmath7 where , @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the momentum of the emitted photon .",
    "as the photon emitted is on - shell , the form factors need to be evaluated at @xmath10 . in this limit ,",
    "@xmath11 and the coefficient of @xmath12 is zero in the on - shell matrix element .",
    "hence , the branching ratio can be expressed in terms of a single form factor , for example @xmath4 .",
    "we calculate with a selection of quark masses near the charm mass and extrapolate to the @xmath13-quark scale . in the heavy quark limit ,",
    "heavy quark symmetry  @xcite tells us that , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the pseudoscalar mass . combining this with the relation @xmath16 constrains the @xmath17 dependence of the form factors",
    "however , it does not provide a scaling law for @xmath4 without further assumptions about the actual @xmath17 behaviour of the form factors .",
    "pole dominance ideas suggest that , @xmath18 for @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a mass that is equal to @xmath15 plus @xmath21 corrections and @xmath22 is a power . since @xmath23 for large @xmath15",
    ", the combination of heavy quark symmetry and the form factor relation at @xmath10 implies that @xmath24 .",
    "for example , @xmath25 could be a constant and @xmath26 a single pole , or @xmath25 could be a single pole and @xmath26 a double pole .",
    "these two cases correspond to , @xmath27 the data appear visually to favour @xmath25 constant in @xmath17 when @xmath15 is around the charm scale .",
    "however , we will consider both constant and single pole behaviours for @xmath25 below .",
    "as demonstrated in a previous paper  @xcite , the evaluation of @xmath28 is relatively straightforward , and @xmath29 can be determined in a similar way .",
    "we fit @xmath26 to a pole or dipole model in order to obtain the on - shell form factor @xmath4 , @xmath30 the difference between the two models was found to be negligible .",
    "the form factor @xmath29 was fitted to a pole model or constant the ratio @xmath31 at @xmath10 for dipole / pole and pole / constant fits is shown in  fig.([fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "the magnitude is found to be consistent with 1 at low masses , in accordance with the identity @xmath32 ,  eq.([eq : t1_t2_equal ] ) . at higher masses ,",
    "the dipole / pole fits for @xmath31 deviate less than the pole / constant fits .",
    "in order to test heavy quark scaling , we also extracted the form factor @xmath29 at maximum recoil , where @xmath34 , in the same way as bernard _ et al .",

    ", @xmath5 is expected to scale as @xmath35 , analogous to the scaling of @xmath36 .",
    "higher order @xmath21 and radiative corrections will also be present . for convenience ,",
    "we remove the leading scaling behaviour by forming the quantity , @xmath37 the normalisation ensures that @xmath38 at the physical mass @xmath33 .",
    "linear and quadratic correlated fits for @xmath39 were carried out with the functions , @xmath40 and are shown in  fig.([fig : t2-extrapolation ] ) .",
    "taking the quadratic fit of @xmath29 at @xmath41 as the best estimate , and the difference between the central values of the linear and quadratic fits as an estimate of the sytematic error , @xmath29 was found to be , @xmath42 if the @xmath17 dependence of @xmath29 at @xmath33 were known , this result could be related to @xmath4 via the identity @xmath32 .",
    "for @xmath4 we test the two possible scaling laws in the same way as for @xmath29 , by forming the quantity , @xmath43 where @xmath44 . for @xmath45 , a similar scaling relationship has been found using light - cone sum rules by ali , braun and simma  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath46 case has been suggested by other sum rules calculations  @xcite .",
    "linear and quadratic fits were carried out with the same functions as for @xmath29 .",
    "the two cases @xmath44 are shown in  fig.([fig : t1-extrapolation ] ) .",
    "the @xmath47 are approximately 1 for the scaling laws , indicating that the models are statistically valid in the available mass range .",
    "the final results for @xmath48 are taken from the quadratic fit for @xmath49 , with the systematic error estimated as for @xmath29 , @xmath50",
