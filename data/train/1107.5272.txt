    "the microscopic physics underlying high @xmath6 superconductivity in the cuprates is believed to be purely electronic in origin , in contrast to ordinary superconductors where the attractive mechanism is due to phonons .",
    "strongly correlated electron models such as the two - dimensional hubbard model have been proposed to describe it .",
    "the hubbard model simply describes electrons hopping on a square lattice subject to strong , local , coulombic _",
    "repulsion_. since it is known that the condensed charge carriers have charge @xmath7 , and thus some kind of cooper pairing is involved , the main open problem is to identify the precise pairing mechanism .",
    "several mechanisms were proposed early on , in particular mechanisms based on spin fluctuations@xcite , charge fluctuations@xcite , and other more exotic ideas such as resonating valence bonds@xcite .",
    "a more recent work studies the possibility of superconductivity at small coupling , where here the mechanism goes back to ideas of kohn - luttinger@xcite .    since the mott - insulating anti - ferromagnetic phase at half - filling is well understood , much of the theoretical literature attempts to understand",
    "understand how doping `` melts '' the anti - ferromagnetic ( af ) order , and how the resulting state can become superconducting .",
    "this has proven to be difficult to study , perhaps in part due to the fact that af order is spatial , whereas superconducting order is in momentum space .",
    "( for a review and other refereces , see @xcite . )",
    "furthermore , superconductivity exists at reasonably low densities far from the af order at half - filling , which suggests that that one can perhaps treat the model as a gas , with superconductivity arising as a condensation of cooper pairs as in the bcs theory , and we will adopt this point of view in the present work .    since there is as yet no consensus on the precise pairing mechanism in the cuprates , it is worthwhile continuing the search for new ones . in this paper",
    "we take a very conservative approach within the hubbard model , wherein we do not postulate any particular quasi - particle excitations that would play the role of the phonons , and we ignore the af order at very low doping . in a field - theoretic approach to the bcs theory , the pairing instability arises from the sum of the ladder diagrams for phonon exchange , as shown in figure [ ladders ] .",
    "the sum of these diagrams has a pole at energy equal to the gap , and this pole is sufficient to cause the instability , and signifies gapped charge 2 excitations .",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this will be reviewed in section iii .",
    "[ ladders ]    suppose that the electron - phonon interaction were treated as an effective , short - ranged electron - electron interaction , so that exchange of a single phonon were replaced by an effective 4-electron vertex . then the diagrams in figure [ ladders ] become the diagrams in figure [ vscreen ] . in this work",
    "we explore the possibility of pairing instabilities arising from certain similar classes of feynman diagrams in the hubbard model . whereas the diagrams in figure [ vscreen ] lead to the bcs pairing instability for bare _ attractive _ interactions ( see below ) , for repulsive interactions they merely screen the strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "however , as we will show , the sum of another class of diagrams shown in figure [ vex ] do indeed exhibit poles possibly signifying pairing instabilities very near the fermi surface .",
    "an obvious criticism of the present work is that for the cuprates , the coupling is large , and one should not trust perturbation theory . in answer to this , the diagrams we will focus upon can be summed up , and have a well - defined limit as the coupling goes to infinity .",
    "furthermore , since we are focussing on sums of diagrams that lead to poles in the effective pairing potential , it is possible that these singular diagrams dominate the perturbative expansion .",
    "certainly our calculation can be improved upon ; we wish here to present a possible pairing mechanism in its simplest form .",
    "for instance , we ignore the effect of interactions on the quasi - particle energies , and take @xmath8 to be that of the free theory , ignoring self - energy corrections , which are known to be significant in the pseudo - gap region .",
    "one can repeat the analysis for instance by extracting @xmath8 from experiments , however we leave this for the future . at this stage , it is more useful to study the mechanism and its plausibility in its simplest form .",
    "comments on the connection between the present work and our earlier one@xcite are called for . in @xcite the diagrams in figure [ vscreen ] at _ zero chemical potential and temperature _ were viewed as contributions to an effective interaction between 2 electrons in vacuum , and it was shown that there are regions in the brillouin zone where this interaction is attractive .",
    "this effective interaction was then fed into a bcs gap equation , which showed solutions .",
    "our current understanding is that this may not be consistent for the following reasons .",
    "superconductivity is a phenomenon that relies strongly on properties near the fermi surface , fermi blocking , etc , and thus effectively attractive interactions in free space , though they may lead to bound states , are believed to be insufficient to cause superconductivity . in this paper the diagrams in figures [ vscreen ] , [ vex ] are calculated at finite temperature and chemical potential , and can thus be studied near the fermi surface .",
    "in fact , the diagrams in figure [ vex ] are zero at zero density .",
    "although in a different channel than the diagrams in figure [ vscreen ] , they still contribute to cooper - pair green functions , and poles in these functions could signify pairing just as the poles in the diagrams in the direct channel figure [ vscreen ] . in summary , as far as superconductivity is concerned , there is no connection between the present work and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it was suggested that the results in @xcite were perhaps more relevant to the so - called pseudo - gap , since the solutions of the gap equation increased all the way down to zero doping .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we define the cooper ` pairing ' green functions of interest . in section",
    "iii we first review how the cooper pairing instability manifests itself as poles in such green s functions in the bcs theory .",
    "the remainder of this section specializes to the hubbard model , where analogous poles are found for a different class of diagrams .",
    "the latter diagrams have been studied before in the context of landau damping and plasmons . however , in the present work these diagrams are used to define an effective potential , which leads to a different dependence on kinematic variables near the fermi surface .",
    "thus , the detailed effective potential studied in this paper has not been considered before in connection with pairing ; this is explained in detail below .",
    "the gap is related to the location of these poles , and solutions are found numerically . for @xmath2 , we find non - zero gap solutions in the anti - nodal directions in the range of hole doping @xmath9 with a dome - like shape .",

    "for instance , for small @xmath170 , @xmath91 has the following asymptotic form : [ lexsmallq ] ( q , , ) @xmath171    whereas @xmath96 and @xmath95 were treated as independent in the above formulas , physically we are interested in the situation where @xmath98 and @xmath172 , referred to as ` on - shell ' above . in this case",
