    "understanding the physical mechanism of contraction and condensation of molecular cloud cores toward star formation is a long standing issue . to date , two major paradigms have been proposed .",
    "first is that cores are in a magnetically subcritical state , and as the magnetic field dissipates by ambipolar diffusion they collapse quasi - statically ( magnetic model ; * ? ? ?",
    "the other model is that the interstellar medium ( ism ) is dominated by supersonic turbulence and the collision of the turbulent flow forms temporary density enhancements , some of which undergo gravitational collapse ( turbulent model ; * ? ? ?",
    "the magnetic model is favored by some theoretical studies because the magnetic field can be modeled to have arbitrary strength and configurations ( aligned or disordered ) .",
    "it is , however , very difficult to be investigated observationally , being a 3-dimensional vector field . on the other hand , turbulence is ubiquitous in interstellar space .",
    "almost all molecular line emission observed in molecular clouds have larger line widths than those expected from their thermal sound speed .",
    "a difficulty of the turbulent model is its unknown nature , namely the origin of the turbulence .",
    "the interstellar turbulence must have a much shorter dissipation timescale than lifetime of dense cores because its supersonic flow forms shocked regions and the energy is rapidly lost by radiation .",
    "the turbulent model requires a driving mechanism to keep itself over a long timescale .",
    "these two models are supported by some observational evidence .",
    "low density diffuse clouds in general have filamentary structures , where aligned magnetic field lines ( parallel or perpendicular to the long axis ) are often observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these indicate that the ism is frozen onto the magnetic field lines rather than bound by self - gravity .",
    "molecular cloud cores are , on the other hand , reported to be dominated by turbulence , and those forming stars tend to have relatively small line widths @xcite .",
    "this suggests that as interstellar turbulence dissipates , cores tend to get gravitationally bound , condensed , and form stars .",
    "it is also shown that the amount of turbulence is different among regions possibly due to difference in the environment ; for example , cores in taurus have much smaller line widths than those in ophiuchus north and lupus where star formation is not active and the timescale of core evolution is supposed to be longer ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "hence , turbulence is suggested to be one of the key elements controlling star formation activity . for these reasons ,",
    "investigating the origin and driving mechanism of turbulence is vitally important for determining the timescale and necessary conditions of star formation .",
    "a clue may be in the environment , namely , many ob stars are distributed in the ophiuchus north and lupus regions where cores have relatively large line width .",
    "a strong uv radiation field is known to affect kinematics and morphology of molecular clouds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "a promising theoretical model for the origin of interstellar turbulence was proposed by @xcite and following studies @xcite . their model ( hereafter the two - phase medium model )",
    "suggests that shock compressed layers of the interstellar diffuse gas undergo thermal instability and fragment into small scale ( @xmath7 au ) structures composed of denser cold neutral medium ( cnm ) .",
    "they are supposed to coalesce to form larger structures ( @xmath8 au ) .",
    "these cloudlets are embedded in warm neutral medium ( wnm ) , and have random motions ( see fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "the velocity is supersonic with respect to the sound speed of the cnm ( @xmath9 k ) , but subsonic with respect to that of wnm ( @xmath10 k ) @xcite . because of the two - phase medium , turbulence",
    "is sustained for relatively long timescales .    in order to corroborate the idea of the two - phase medium model , we intend to detect small scale structures of the molecular cloud and investigate how interstellar turbulence is driven from the clouds morphological and kinematical structures and their physical properties .",
    "we make detailed observations of co @xmath010 and 32 at the surface of the molecular cloud facing an region where ionization shock compression is expected to be taking place .",
    "is a filamentary cloud complex facing the region ( @xmath11 pc ) , that is excited by the nearest o star , ( spt = o9.5v , @xmath12 pc ) .",
    "this cloud complex was entirely surveyed by the nanten telescope in @xmath13co ( hpbw = 27 ) , and it was found that the cloud is accelerated by illuminating uv radiation @xcite .",
    "the cloud complex horbours embedded dense cores discovered in c@xmath14o , while star formation is not active and no associated young stars have been found @xcite .",
    "the line width of c@xmath14o @xmath010 observed by the nanten telescope in this region is typically as large as @xmath15 km s@xmath1 , significantly larger than that in taurus ( 0.49 km s@xmath1 in average ; * ? ? ?",
    "the strong uv radiation is suggested to have compressed the molecular cloud leading it to form dense cores , while the streaming motions of the low density gas imply considerable kinetic energy input to the ism @xcite .",
    "noteworthy is that is a run - away star traveling through the region ejected from the center of the subgroup of the .",
    "therefore the entire cloud complex is under the influence of the uv radiation from within a few @xmath16 years .",
    "another interesting aspect is that the filamentary cloud is penetrated by magnetic field lines perpendicular to the long axis of the filament @xcite .",
    "the cloud complex is suggested to be controlled by magnetic fields , while no further investigation toward the dense region has been reported .",
    "because of the conditions mentioned above , in particular its proximity and the strong uv radiation , we chose the interface region of and as the best target for the present study .",

    "we also employed scaling for correcting the beam efficiency by multiplying the beam - specific factors provided by the nobeyama observatory .",

    "interferometric observations in multi - transition co lines at cloud boundaries are required . also for the investigation of physical properties of wnm , extensive observation in the submm wavelength is highly desired .",
    "observational results brought by alma combined with aca would enormously improve our understanding in the near future .",
    "in order to investigate the origin of interstellar turbulence and verify the theoretically proposed thermal instability model of two - phase medium , we have carried out co @xmath010 and 32 observations toward a boundary between dark cloud and an region .",
    "the main conclusions are as follows .    1 .   by detailed investigation of spatial and velocity distribution of co @xmath010 , small - scale cloud structures have been discovered .",
    "they have characteristic morphologies such as clumpy , arc - like , and pillar - like structures , which appear in some velocity channels with typical size scale of a few @xmath56 au to 12000 au and the velocity dispersion of @xmath124 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the systemic velocities of these 0.6 km s@xmath1 width component clouds have scatter of a few km s@xmath1 .",
    "3 .   the spectral line profile taken in the middle of the main cloud , and the composite line profile of the entire cloud resemble single component broad - line spectra with velocity dispersion several times larger than the typical sound speed .",
    "these facts suggest that the cloud is composed of tiny cloudlets with small internal velocity dispersion .",
    "because of their relative motion and overlapping effect on the line of sight , molecular clouds are observed to have supersonic turbulence as a whole .",
    "follow - up observations in co @xmath032 for these small structures revealed that the intensity ratio of @xmath51 is close to unity for the 0.6 km s@xmath1 width component , which shows minimum kinetic temperature of @xmath125 25 - 100 k , relatively higher than typical dark clouds .",
    "5 .   from the lvg analysis",
    ", it is found that the 0.6 km s@xmath1 width components have average density of @xmath126 @xmath5 , much higher than the entire cloud average density .",
    "owing to their small sizes , masses of the 0.6 km s@xmath1 width components are estimated to be @xmath127 , well in the domain of brown - dwarf mass .",
    "these results strongly support the theoretical thermal instability model of two - phase medium first proposed by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that the interstellar turbulence is likely to be driven by thermal instability and the small - scale structures are the building blocks of the turbulent molecular clouds .",
    "we are grateful to staff members of the nobeyama radio observatory and the aste support team .",
    "we thank miyuki murai for helping with the 45 m telescope observations and takeshi tsukagoshi for the aste observations .",
    "nobeyama radio observatory is a branch of the national astronomical observatory of japan , national institutes of natural sciences .",
    "the aste project is driven by nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) , a branch of national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) , in collaboration with university of chile , and japanese institutes including university of tokyo , nagoya university , osaka prefecture university , ibaraki university , and hokkaido university .",
    "observations with aste were in part carried out remotely from japan by using ntt s gemnet2 and its partnet r&e ( research and education ) networks , which are based on accessnova collaboration of university of chile , ntt laboratories , and naoj .",
    "this work is financially supported by the grants - in - aid for the scientific research by the ministry of education , science , sports and culture ( no .  23540277 and 23740154 ) .",
    "this publication is supported as a project of the nordrhein - westflische akademie der wissenschaften und der knste in the framework of the academy program by the federal republic of germany and the state nordrhein - westfalen .",
    "besides the molecular and ionized gas components , dust is an important content of the ism",
    ". the emission , absorption and scattered light by the interstellar dust can provide morphological , geometrical and temperature information of the cloud .",
    "an h@xmath128 image was obtained toward the entire cloud complex of with vysos-6 a , a 150 mm telescopes of the universittssternwarte bochum in chile .",
    "ten images each with an integration time of 2 minutes were taken during march 24th and 25th 2012 .",
    "the images were taken with an h@xmath128 filter whose central wavelength and the fwhm are 656 nm and 5 nm , respectively , and in dither - mode for bad - pixels removal . after dark and bias subtraction and flatfielding the images were combined using a min / max - rejection .",
    "the reduced image was then binned ( @xmath129 ) and low - pass filtered . in the observed region , the extinction of h@xmath128 is not as prominent as in the main filament of , but visible as a dark nebular near the edge of the spherical region ( fig .",
    "[ halpha ] ) .",
    "this ensures that the entire cloud is located in front of the str \" omgren sphere and gas is accelerated toward us by the uv light @xcite .    the global distribution of the co emission",
    "is compared with the dust thermal emission in 100 @xmath130 m by @xcite .",
    "they are in good agreement in general , but the 100 @xmath130 m emission is enhanced at the cloud surface irradiated by the uv light .",
    "the dust temperature distribution is represented by the color of far - ir thermal emission .",
    "[ iras ] is the 3-color composite image of the entire region of produced with the improved reprocessing of the iras survey ( iris ) data .",
    "the cloud surface is heated by uv radiation and the dust has relatively high temperature as demonstrated by the enhanced 60 @xmath130 m emission over 100 @xmath130 m .",
    "the local high temperature causes the enhancement of 100 @xmath130 m emissivity at the cloud surface relative to the co line @xcite .",
    "the dense parts of the cloud are , on the contrary , in low - temperature indicated by relatively strong emission in 100 @xmath130 m .",
    "recent preliminary release of the wide - field infrared survey explorer ( wise ) data  is compared with the co distribution .",
    "[ wise ] shows 3-color composite image in the region around using the band 4 ( 22 @xmath130 m ) in red , band 3 ( 12 @xmath130 m ) in green , and band 2 ( 4.5 @xmath130 m ) in blue .",
    "the 22 @xmath130 m emission is supposed to come from small dust particles not in thermal equilibrium , while the 12 @xmath130 m one is rather dominated by the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) excited by uv light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . these mid - ir emission in general delineate the cloud surface facing the region , while the emission in 12 @xmath130 m appears to be more spread than in 22 @xmath130 m .",
    "on the other hand , the dense part in the cloud traced by c@xmath14o @xmath010 @xcite appears to be a dark lane in mid - ir , unlike at 100 @xmath130 m , slightly offset to the far side from .",
    "the dust in the cloud is supposed to have high column density and low temperature in the dark lane .",
    "the co @xmath010 distribution of the present study traces the edge of the cloud where the column density is not so high but mid - ir is bright in emission . besides the cloud s edge , diffuse mid - ir emission is extended outside the region detected in co. it suggests that considerable amount of molecular gas is photo - evaporated by the uv radiation but the warm dust grains remain at the cloud surface .",
    "this feature is , on the contrary , not clearly visible in the absorption feature of h@xmath128 , implying that the warm dust cloud has relatively low column density .",
