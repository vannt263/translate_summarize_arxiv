    "electron antineutrinos emitted in the decay chains of the heat - producing elements ( hpe ) u , th , and k in terrestrial rocks  the so - called geo - neutrinos  represent a truly unique probe of the earth interior ; see @xcite for a recent review and @xcite for earlier discussions and references .",
    "the first indications for a ( u+th ) geo - neutrino signal at @xmath0 confidence level in the kamland experiment by @xcite have boosted the interest in this field , and have started to bridge the two communities of particle physicists and earth scientists  as exemplarily testified by this workshop ( neutrino geophysics , honolulu , hawaii , 2005 ) .",
    "the hope is that future measurement of geo - neutrino fluxes can put statistically significant constraints to the global abundances of hpe s and to their associated heat production rates , which are currently subject to highly debated earth model assumptions @xcite .",
    "this goal , despite being experimentally very challenging , is extremely important and deserves dedicated ( possibly joint ) studies from both scientific communities .    one methodological difficulty is represented by the different `` feeling '' for uncertainties by particle physicists _ vs _ earth scientists .",
    "first important attempts to systematize ( u , th , k ) abundance uncertainties in a format convenient for geo - neutrino analyses have been performed in @xcite and particularly in @xcite , where errors have been basically assessed from the spread in published estimates ( consistently with mass balance constraints ) .",
    "we propose to make a further step , by systematically taking into account the ubiquitous error _ covariances _ , i.e. , the fact that several quantities happen to vary in the same direction ( positive correlations ) or in opposite directions ( negative correlations ) in the geo - neutrino context .",
    "for instance , in a given earth reservoir ( say , the mantle ) , the u , th and k abundances are typically positively correlated .",
    "however , they may be anticorrelated in two complementary reservoirs constrained by mass balance arguments , such as the mantle and the crust in bulk silicate earth ( bse ) models .",
    "experimental geo - neutrino observables may be further ( anti)correlated by instrumental effects .",
    "an extensive discussion of our approach to these problems is beyond the scope of this contribution and will be presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "here we briefly report about some selected issues and results , according to the following scheme . in sec .  2 we discuss the general aspects and the statistical tools related to covariance analyses , with emphasis on geo - neutrino observables . in sec .",
    "3 we construct a tentative model for the source distribution of ( u , th , k ) in global earth reservoirs ( geo neutrino source model , gnsm ) . in sec .",
    "4 we discuss some issues related to the characterization of local sources around geo - neutrino detector sites . in sec .  5 and 6",
    "we show examples of `` forward '' error estimates ( i.e. , propagation of gnsm errors to predicted geo - neutrino rates ) and shortly discuss `` backward '' error updates ( i.e. , gnsm error reduction through prospective geo - neutrino data ) .",
    "we draw our conclusions in sec .",
    "in this section we discuss some general aspects of covariance analyses in geochemistry and in neutrino physics , and then present the basic tools relevant for geo - neutrino physics .",
    "we remind that , for any two quantities @xmath1 and @xmath2 , estimated as @xmath3 the correlation index @xmath4 $ ] between the 1-@xmath5 errors of @xmath1 and @xmath2 parameterizes the degree of `` covariation '' of the two quantities : @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) if they change in the same ( opposite ) direction , while @xmath8 if they change independently ; see , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the covariance ( or squared error ) matrix of @xmath1 and @xmath2 contains @xmath9 and @xmath10 as diagonal elements , and @xmath11 as off - diagonal ones . for more than two variables with errors @xmath12 and correlations @xmath13 , the covariance matrix is @xmath14 ( symmetric , with @xmath15 on the diagonal ) .      in 1998 ,",
    "the geochemical earth reference model ( germ ) initiative was officially launched @xcite , in order to provide a `` consensus model '' for the elemental abundances , together with their errors and correlations , in all relevant earth reservoirs .",
    "although a lot of work has been done in this direction , e.g. , through rich compilations of data and estimates ( www.earthref.org ) , the correlation matrices have not yet been estimated  not even for subsets of elements such as ( u , th , k ) . to our knowledge ,",
    "only a few regional studies discuss hpe covariances .",
    "these difficulties can be in part overcome by using the ( more frequently reported ) elemental ratio information .",
    "for instance , if the ratio of two abundances @xmath1 and @xmath2 is reported together with its error @xmath16 , the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be inferred through the following statistical relation , valid at first order in error propagation : @xmath17 although the `` ratio '' and `` correlation '' information appear to be interchangeable through the above formula , from a methodological viewpoint it is better to use the latter rather than the first , since the ratio of two gaussian variables is a cauchy distribution with formally infinite variance @xcite  a rather tricky object in statistical manipulations .",
    "neutrino physics has undergone a revolution in recent years , after the discovery of neutrino flavor oscillations .",
    "phenomenological fits to neutrino oscillation data have become increasingly refined , and now routinely include covariance analyses ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for our purposes , a relevant example is also given by the standard solar model @xcite , which provides , among other things , errors and correlations for solar neutrino sources .",
    "we shall try to apply a similar `` format '' to a geo - neutrino source model in sec .",
    "correlations arise not only at the level of neutrino sources , but also at the detection level , as a consequence of instrumental effects .",
    "for instance , the kamland experiment is currently more sensitive to the sum ( u+th ) of geo - neutrino fluxes rather than to the separate u and th components . as a consequence , the measured u and th",
    "geo - neutrino event rates are anticorrelated : if one rate increases the other one tends to decrease , in order to keep the total rate constant ( within errors ) .",
    "figure  1 shows explicitly the anticorrelation between the u and th experimental rates through their 1 , 2 , and 3-@xmath5 contours ( solid lines ) taken from our kamland data analysis @xcite .",
    "the contours in fig .",
    "1 are well approximated by a bivariate gaussian ( dashed lines ) with parameters : @xmath18 we have also verified that our kamland data analysis reproduces the confidence level contours in the alternative plane spanned by @xmath19 and @xmath20 @xcite ( not shown ) ; however , as explained in the previous subsection , we prefer to avoid any `` ratio '' and to use just @xmath21 and their correlation .      in the context of geo - neutrinos ,",
    "statistical analyses are greatly simplified by the fact that all relevant observables are linear combinations of the hpe abundances @xmath22 in different reservoirs ( s  =  u , th , k ; @xmath23 reservoir index ) , with coefficient determined by known physics and by the geometry of the earth mass distribution .",

    "such quantities can be written as : @xmath42 where the universal coefficients @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , according to our calculations @xcite , are given in table  [ univ ] .",
    "in the above equations , @xmath43 is the mass of the @xmath34-th reservoir , while @xmath44 is the average survival oscillation probability of geo-@xmath29 .",
    "the geometrical coefficients @xmath45 represent the mass - weighted average of the inverse square distance of the detector site @xmath38 from the @xmath34-th reservoir , necessary to account for the flux decrease with distance ; their numerical values will be reported elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the earth mass distribution necessary to compute the @xmath43 s and @xmath45 s is taken from the preliminary earth reference model ( prem ) @xcite , properly matched with a crustal model defined over a grid of @xmath46 tiles @xcite .",
    "the earth is assumed to be partitioned into the following homogeneous reservoirs : core , lower mantle , upper mantle , continental crust ( in three layers  upper , middle , lower ) and oceanic crust ( lumped into one layer ) .",
    "the distinction ( if any ) between lower and upper mantle is strongly debated and will be commented later . for a set of possible geo - neutrino detector sites ( kamioka , gran sasso , sudbury , hawaii , pyhsalmi , baksan ) , we consider `` local '' reservoirs , defined as the nine ( three - by - three ) tiles of the @xmath47 model which surround each detector site  except for kamioka , where 13 tiles are considered , corresponding to the `` japanese arc and forearc '' as defined in the crustal model @xcite . due to the inverse - squared - distance decrease of the neutrino flux",
    ", it turns out that local and global reservoirs can provide comparable contributions to the geo - neutrino event rates , at least for detectors sitting on the continental crust .",

    "we remind that , concerning the entries for eq .",
    "( [ errordef ] ) ( errors only , no correlations ) , our approach overlaps in part with earlier relevant work performed in @xcite .",
    "bulk silicate earth ( bse ) models @xcite provide global constraints on elemental abundances ( especially in the primitive mantle ) , under a set of hypotheses .",
    "in particular , bse models include the plausible assumption that elements which have both high condensation temperature ( `` refractory '' ) and that are preferentially embedded in rocks rather in iron ( `` lithophile '' ) should be found in the primitive mantle ( i.e. , in the undifferentiated mantle+crust reservoir ) in the same ratio as in the parent , pristine meteoritic material . among the three main hpe s ( u , th",
    ", k ) , the first two are also refractory lithophile elements ( rle ) , so the th / u global ratio should be the same in bse and in the ( supposedly ) parent and most primitive meteoritic material ( carbonaceous chondrites ci ) . our summary @xcite of the recent and detailed works on absolute @xcite and relative @xcite u and",
    "th abundances in ci meteorites ( with @xmath66 errors ) is : @xmath67 which implies a ( th , u ) error correlation @xmath68 through eq .",
    "( [ rhopq ] ) .",
    "the bse / ci abundance ratio is expected to be the same for all rle s , if indeed they did not volatilize during the earth formation history .",
    "the benchmark is usually provided by a major rle element such as al , which , being much more abundant than the trace elements th and u , can be more robustly constrained , both by mass - balance arguments and by direct sampling .",
    "our summary @xcite for the bse / ci abundance ratio of al from three detailed bse models @xcite is @xmath69 the previous arguments and estimates imply that @xmath70 with ( th , u ) error correlation @xmath71 .",
    "the k element , being ( moderately ) volatile , needs a separate discussion . in @xcite",
    "it was argued that u is a good `` global '' proxy for k , since : ( 1 ) the k / u abundance ratio was found to be nearly constant in 22 samples of mid - ocean ridge basalt ( morb ) from the atlantic and pacific ocean floor ( thought to be representative of the whole mantle ) ; ( 2 ) the morb k / u ratio was found to be ( accidentally ) similar to the k / u ratio estimate in the crust from an older model @xcite .",
    "the morb k / u ratio ( @xmath72 ) was then boldly generalized to the whole earth , with small estimated errors ( 1.6% ) @xcite .",
    "however , it should be noticed there are no geochemical arguments to presume that disparate elements such as u and k should have the same partition coefficients between melt (=  crust ) and residual mineral (=  depleted mantle ) ; indeed , analogous alleged coincidences have later been disproved @xcite . therefore , we think that the `` canonical k / u=12,700 '' ratio , so often quoted in the geochemical literature , should be critically revisited in future studies . provisionally , from a survey of recent literature about the abundances of k and u ( and of another possible k - proxy element , la @xcite ) in morb databases , continental crust samples and estimates , and bse models , we are inclined to @xcite : ( 1 ) increase significantly  although subjectively  the k / u uncertainty ; and ( 2 ) slightly lower the central value ( as compared with @xcite ) . more precisely , we take @xmath73 which , by proper error propagation , gives the absolute k abundance as @xmath74 with ( k , th ) and ( k , u ) correlations equal to 0.648 and 0.701 , respectively .",
    "table  2 presents a summary of the bse ( u , th , k ) abundances , errors and correlation matrix , together with similar information about the main bse sub - reservoirs ( as discussed below ) .",
    "needless to say , all the above bse estimates may be significantly altered , if possible indications for nonzero hpe abundances in the earth core @xcite are corroborated by further studies . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we do not consider such possibility in this work .",
    "average elemental abundances in the continental crust ( cc ) , and their vertical distribution in the three main identifiable layers ( upper , middle , lower crust = uc , mc , lc ) , have been presented in a recent comprehensive review @xcite , together with a wealth of data and with a critical survey of earlier literature on the subject . in particular , it is stressed in @xcite that some previous cc models are not consistent with known crustal heat production constraints @xcite .",
    "this fact shows that : ( 1 ) the spread of published values for elemental abundances is not necessarily indicative of the real uncertainties , since some estimates can be invalidated by new and independent data ; ( 2 ) heat production estimates in the cc provide a relevant constraint ( linear in the u , th , k crustal abundances ) which might help , together with geo - neutrino measurements , to reduce the hpe abundance estimates in reference models .",
    "the latter point will be further elaborated elsewhere @xcite .",
    "we basically adopt the results in @xcite for the uc , mc , lc abundances of ( u ,  th ,  k ) and their uncertainties , with the following differences : ( 1 ) since no error estimates are given for the lc , we conservatively ( but arbitrarily ) assume fractional @xmath66 errors of @xmath75 in this layer ; ( 2 ) our reference crustal model @xcite and the one in @xcite provide mass ratios among layers ( uc : mc : lc ) respectively equal to 0.359:0.330:0.311 and 0.317:0.296:0.387 .",
    "this difference is somewhat disappointing , since it induces weighted - average hpe abundance shifts in the cc of order @xmath76 , which are definitely nonnegligible .",
    "`` consensus values '' for the mass distribution in the three cc layers ( upper , middle , lower ) would thus be desirable in the future . provisionally , we assume that cc elemental abundance errors can not be smaller than the `` mass distribution '' induced error ( 10% ) .",
    "we also assume , from a survey of the relevant literature , a @xmath77 fractional error for each of the k / u , th / u , and k / th ratios in the crust  which in turn provide the ( u , th , k ) correlations @xcite . given such inputs , the cc abundances ( central values , errors , and correlations ) turn out to be as shown in table  2 .      we assume a homogeneous composition for the upper mantle ( defined as the sum of transition zone + low - velocity zone + `` lid '' in the prem model @xcite ) .",
    "global and detailed analyses of all the available upper mantle samples and constraints have been performed in two recent papers @xcite which , unfortunately , do not really agree in their conclusions , despite being based in part on the same petrological database ( www.petdb.org ) .",
    "concerning hpe s , we then take as central values the average of @xcite and @xcite , but we attach the most conservative error estimates of @xcite , which are large enough to cover the spread between @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume a k / u ratio error in the upper mantle of the same size as for the bse ( @xmath78 ) , and a th / u ratio error of @xmath79 , as suggested from the scatter of points in fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "given such inputs , the um abundances turn out to be @xcite as shown in table  2 .",
    "the oceanic crust is difficult to sample and , not surprisingly , only a few papers ( to our knowledge ) deal with its average trace - element composition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we adopt the `` intermediate '' central values of @xcite , which suggest a hpe enrichment of the oceanic crust by a factor 2025 with respect to the ( parent ) upper mantle .",
    "since the enrichment is approximately uniform for all three hpe s , we think it reasonable to assume that the same relative spread of abundances is transferred from the um ( parent mineral ) to the oc ( melt ) .",
    "therefore , in the absence of other information , we attach to the ( u , th , k ) abundances in the oc the same fractional errors and correlations as for the um , see table  2 .      the consistent derivation of lm abundances , errors and correlations is a qualifying result of our work .",
    "the abundances in the lower mantle ( lm ) are obtained by subtraction ( lm = bse - um - cc - oc ) , namely , by the mass balance constraint : @xmath80 for s = u , th , k. since the three hpe abundances @xmath81 are linear combinations of bse , um , cc , and oc abundances , it is possible to apply the formalism of sec .  2.3 and to obtain their errors and correlations ,",
    "whose numerical values are listed in table  2 ( last three columns ) .",
    "it turns out that the lm fractional uncertainties are comparable to those of the um ( @xmath82 ) , and that the lm abundances are strongly correlated with the bse ones but moderately anticorrelated with the cc ones , due to the subtraction procedure .",
    "the lm anticorrelation with the um and oc is instead very small , since the latter two reservoirs contain relatively small absolute amounts of hpe s , as compared to the cc and bse .",
    "once the lm contents of hpe s are obtained , the bse information becomes redundant , and one can proceed with the information contained in the 12 entries for the ( cc , oc , um , lm ) abundances , and the corresponding @xmath83 correlation matrix , which are reported in table  2 . notice that , within the quoted uncertainties , the abundances in table  2 are consistent with those reported in @xcite .",
    "there is currently a strong debate about the nature and extent of mantle convection , with scenarios ranging from two - layer models ( with geochemically decoupled um and lm ) to whole mantle convection ( with completely mixed um and lm ) , and many intermediate possibilities and variants @xcite .",
    "two extreme possibilities are : ( 1 ) a geochemically homogeneous mantle ( i.e. , no difference between um and lm , @xmath84 ) ; and ( 1 ) a strict two - layer model ( i.e. , a lower mantle conserving primitive mantle abundances , @xmath85 ) .",
    "our estimates in table  2 are intermediate between such two cases , and thus agree better with models predicting partial mantle mixing .",
    "the two extreme cases are anyway recovered by stretching the uncertainties to roughly @xmath86 .",
    "2 shows the 1 , 2 , and @xmath87 error ellipses in the ( lm , um ) and ( lm , bse ) uranium abundance planes ; within @xmath87 , both cases @xmath88 and @xmath89 ( slanted lines ) are allowed .",
    "similar results are obtained for th and k ( not shown ) .",
    "therefore , our gnsm estimates are sufficiently conservative to cover , within @xmath86 , a wide spectrum of mantle mixing scenarios ( two - layer convection , partial um - lm mixing , whole mantle convection ) .",
    "in our work , local reservoirs have been arbitrarily defined as the nine crustal tiles around each detector ( except for kamioka ) , see sec .  2.3 . here",
    "we discuss some issues related to this or other choices for the `` local '' contribution to geo - neutrino fluxes .",
    "it is necessary to define in some way `` local '' reservoirs , since the crust ( and perhaps the mantle ) within a few hundred km from each detectors site may well be different from the average crust defined in the previous section .",
    "this fact has already been recognized in @xcite , where `` local '' hpe abundances for the kamioka site have been estimated .",
    "the boundaries of the local crust are matter of convention  but any convention is not without consequences , however . in particular , in our approach , we observe that the correlation between `` local '' reservoirs and `` global '' ones ( lm , um , oc , cc ) is expected to vanish : the uncertainty of the u abundance near the kamioka mine has probably nothing to do with the errors of the whole cc and oc crust estimates .",
    "however , only dedicated studies , which should take into account all locally homogenous geochemical micro - reservoirs and their correlation lengths with farther geo - structures , can provide a physically motivated distinction between local and global reservoirs ",
    "a task much beyond the scope of this work . for simplicity",
    ", we just assume that all local - to - global abundance correlations are exactly zero .      assuming that a `` local '' reservoir is defined in some way , its volumetric distributions of hpe s can significantly affect the estimated geo-@xmath90 fluxes , due to the inverse square distance dependence . in principle",
    ", one would like to have such detailed information around each detector site , both horizontally and vertically .",
    "in practice , however , one usually has mainly scattered `` surface '' samples and only weak constraints about the vertical hpe distribution .",
    "although the hpe abundances are expected to decrease with depth , the decrease may be highly site - dependent and non - monotonic ( see @xcite as an example for the japanese crust ) . in some cases ( e.g. , sudbury @xcite ) the horizontal and vertical distributions of hpe s",
    "are correlated by the fact that the crust is locally `` tilted ''  a situation which may represent both a complication and an opportunity .    in all cases ,",
    "significant progress in the characterization of the hpe volumetric distribution in local reservoirs can be obtained only by dedicated geophysical and geochemical studies , which should collect all the ( currently sparse and partly unpublished ) relevant pieces of data , including representative rock samples , local crustal models , and heat flow measurements .",
    "some interesting work in this direction has been done for the kamioka site @xcite , showing that a @xmath91 uncertainty in the local geo - neutrino flux ( at @xmath66 ) may perhaps be reachable .",
    "we think that @xmath76 should be the `` target error '' for the characterization of the local geo - neutrino flux at each detector site .",
    "much larger errors would hide information coming from farther reservoirs , and in particular from the mantle .      in order to make provisional numerical estimates",
    ", we make the following assumptions for local hpe abundances in the crust : ( 1 ) we assume the same numerical values and errors as for the average upper , middle , and lower crust estimates @xcite discussed in sec .  3.2 , except for the kamioka site where",
    "the average upper crust abundances are taken from the thorough geochemical study in @xcite ; ( 2 ) we assume that the correlations between local and global abundances , as well between local crust layers , are zero ; ( 3 ) we assume a plausible ( but arbitrary ) hierarchy of correlations between hpe abundances in each layer : @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , implying that th is a good proxy for u and that k is a somewhat worse proxy for both u and th ( as it generally happens in other reservoirs ) .",
    "further comments about such choices are given elsewhere @xcite .",
    "as previously remarked , the admittedly arbitrary assumptions characterizing local contributions to geo-@xmath90 fluxes can and should be improved by dedicated inter - disciplinary studies .",
    "we have described in sec .  2 a possible path towards the definition of a gnsm , i.e. , of a set of hpe abundances , errors and correlations in a given partition of the earth into global and local reservoirs .",
    "we now show examples of propagation of such uncertainties , according to eqs .",
    "( [ pq1])([rhopq ] ) .",
    "figure  3 shows our estimated geo - neutrino event rates from u and th decays at the kamioka site ( including neutrino oscillations with @xmath95 , superposed to the same experimental ( gaussian ) contours as in fig .  1 .",
    "the numerical values for the gnsm predictions are : @xmath96 the correlation between the theoretical rates is positive , since th and u are good proxies of one another in each reservoir .",
    "the total ( u+th ) rate in kamioka is also positively correlated with the total ( u+th+k ) radiogenic heat @xmath35 in the earth .",
    "we estimate : @xmath97 the strong correlation between @xmath98 and @xmath35 implies that a precise measurement of the former would yield a robust constraint on the latter .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental errors in fig .",
    "3 are still much larger than the theoretical ( gnsm ) ones , implying that , at present , the first kamland data do not significantly constrain plausible earth models and the associated radiogenic heat ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "patient accumulation of statistics , significant reduction of background and systematics , and new independent experiments , are required to test and constrain typical earth model predictions .",
    "table  3 shows our estimates for the total ( u+th ) rates ( central values and @xmath99 error ) at different possible detector sites , together with their correlation matrix .",
    "correlations are always positive ( when one rate increases , any other is typically expected to do the same ) , but can either be strong ( such as between gran sasso and pyhsalmi , both located in somewhat similar cc settings ) , or relatively weak ( such as between any `` continental crustal site '' and the peculiar `` oceanic site '' at hawaii , which sits on the mantle ) .",
    "such correlations should be taken into account in the future , when data from two or more detectors will be compared with earth models .",
    "as shown in fig .  3 , the first kamland data do not yet constrain our tentative gnsm . however",
    ", it is tempting to investigate the impact of future , high - statistics and multi - detector geo - neutrino data on the model . in particular , one might try to estimate what are the hpe abundances which best fit _ both _ the starting gnsm _ and _ a set of prospective , hypothetical experimental data ( `` backward '' update of gnsm errors ) .",
    "it can be shown that the covariance formalism allows to reduce this problem to matrix algebra @xcite .    here",
    "we give just a relevant example of possible results , in an admittedly optimistic future scenario where all 6 detectors in table  3 are operative and collect separately u and th events for a total exposure of 20 kilo - ton year , at exactly the predicted rate , with no background and no systematics . in such scenario , the mantle and bse uranium abundance errors would be reduced as in fig .  4 , which should be compared with the previous estimates in fig .",
    "it can be seen that , in principle , the depicted scenario might allow to reject at @xmath100 the case @xmath101 , i.e. , of global mantle convection , which would be a really relevant result in geophysics and geochemistry .",
    "needless to say , more realistic ( and less optimistic ) simulations of prospective data need to be performed in order to check if similar goals can be experimentally reached . in any case , our approach may provide a useful template for such numerical studies .",

    "<S> geo - neutrinos emitted by heat - producing elements ( u , th and k ) represent a unique probe of the earth interior . </S>",
    "<S> the characterization of their fluxes is subject , however , to rather large and highly correlated uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> the geochemical covariance of the u , th and k abundances in various earth reservoirs induces positive correlations among the associated geo - neutrino fluxes , and between these and the radiogenic heat . </S>",
    "<S> mass - balance constraints in the bulk silicate earth ( bse ) tend instead to anti - correlate the radiogenic element abundances in complementary reservoirs . </S>",
    "<S> experimental geo - neutrino observables may be further ( anti)correlated by instrumental effects . in this context </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a systematic approach to covariance matrices , based on the fact that all the relevant geo - neutrino observables and constraints can be expressed as linear functions of the u , th and k abundances in the earth s reservoirs ( with relatively well - known coefficients ) . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly discuss here the construction of a tentative `` geo - neutrino source model '' ( gnsm ) for the u , th , and k abundances in the main earth reservoirs , based on selected geophysical and geochemical data and models ( when available ) , on plausible hypotheses ( when possible ) , and admittedly on arbitrary assumptions ( when unavoidable ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use then the gnsm to make predictions about several experiments ( `` forward approach '' ) , and to show how future data can constrain _ a posteriori _ the error matrix of the model itself ( `` backward approach '' ) . the method may provide a useful statistical framework for evaluating the impact and the global consistency of prospective geo - neutrino measurements and earth models . </S>"
