    "in recent times evidence has accumulated indicating that the galactic halo formed at least in part by accretion of material from smaller extragalactic systems .",
    "this view is in accordance with the hierarchical theory of structure formation in the universe , in which the first objects to form are small galaxies , which then merge into the larger structures observed today .",
    "a consequence of this theory is that substructures should still be present within the old stars of the galactic halo and disk .",
    "thus , the merger history of our galaxy should show up in the distribution of old stars , as coherent tidal streams , tails , moving clusters , etc .",
    "( majewski 2004 , 2005 and references therein ) .",
    "but quite apart from the merger history of our galaxy , the stellar halo we now observe is also the result of the dynamical disruption of many globular clusters .",
    "such disrupted clusters should also leave their signatures in the motions of the halo stars and should show up as dynamically coherent groupings in phase space .",
    "poveda  ( 1992 ) searched for such groupings among the nearby halo stars of the first schuster  catalogues ( schuster and nissen 1988 , 1989a , 1989b , henceforth sn1 ) and they were able to identify seven moving groups , characterized by the similarity of their integrals of motion ( the energy @xmath0 and the @xmath1-component of the angular momentum @xmath2 ) as well as by their similar metallicities [ fe / h ] .",
    "in particular , the kapteyn and the groombridge 1830 moving groups were re - discovered .    on the other hand",
    ", there exists a small number of old and extremely wide binaries ( @xmath3 au ) that are very difficult to understand dynamically ( allen  2000b , carney  1997 ) . in table 1",
    "we provide a few examples .",
    "the first six rows list parameters of the galactic orbits of these binaries .",
    "the metallicity , [ fe / h ] , is given in row 7 .",
    "the last two rows list the observed ( projected ) separations of the binaries and the expected major semiaxes , calculated according to the theoretical formula given by couteau ( 1960 ) .",
    "the values for the major semiaxes are quite large , and since these binaries are old , they should have been already dissociated .",
    "one possibility is that they have survived because they spend only a small fraction of their lives in the galactic disk , and they cross it at high speeds ( allen  2000a ) .",
    "but perhaps there is another way in which they can survive to the present day as binaries .",
    "they may , in fact , have been part of bound moving halo clusters , now dissolving or already dissolved .",
    ".properties of some extremely wide , old binaries [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "old wide binaries may have survived either because they spend little time in the galactic disk , crossing it at high speeds , or else because they were once members of bound clusters or still belong to moving groups . a search for `` phase space clumps '' among the stars of schuster  ( 2006 ) yielded about a dozen groups of similar metallicities and galactic orbits .",
    "previously known wide binaries turned out to be present in six of the identified moving groups .",
    "we may turn to detailed chemical composition analyses to distinguish whether a grouping had a galactic origin or else if it is an accreted structure .",
    "chemical peculiarities , like low [ o / fe ] or especially , low [ @xmath4/fe ] are characteristic of enrichment by type ia supernovae , and thus of a chemical history different from that of our galaxy . along with high eccentricities of the galactic orbits , or retrograde motions ,",
    "these chemical peculiarities are thought to be signatures of accreted structures ( dwarf galaxies ) .",
    "at least 5 of our old wide binaries have such peculiarities , and 3 are members of moving groups , which thus may be the remains of dwarf galaxies accreted onto the galactic halo ."
