    "the goal of quantum many ",
    "body physics is the understanding of properties of materials ranging from quantum magnets to high  tc superconductors .",
    "for this task , theorists have developed a variety of simplified models which allow us to describe the rich phenomenology that is observed in those systems . in the last years ,",
    "progress in the manipulation of matter at the microscopic scale has changed dramatically this situation .",
    "atomic experimental systems such as cold atoms in optical lattices offer us the possibility to tune interactions and engineer at will quantum phases . in this way",
    "quantum interacting models can be studied in a controlled way and some of the limitations of solid - state set - ups are overcome . a successful step in this direction",
    "was given recently with the observation @xcite of the superfluid ",

    "recently , cold atoms in optical lattices have also been proposed for the simulation of certain quantum spin models @xcite .    on the other hand",
    "trapped ions are a clean experimental system where quantum optics offers us accurate techniques for the manipulation and measurement of quantum states @xcite . in the last years",
    "this experimental field has been mainly motivated by applications to quantum information processing @xcite , in which internal electronic states are used as qubits , and vibrational modes permit us to perform quantum gates between them @xcite .",
    "in fact , by using similar ideas we have shown recently that trapped ions can be used for the study of a rich variety of quantum interacting models @xcite .",
    "the experimental requirements for the study of quantum interacting systems with trapped ions are indeed much less stringent than those for quantum information tasks .    in this paper",
    "we pursue the ideas proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for the realization of a quantum simulator @xcite of quantum magnetism with trapped ions .",
    "we focus on the possibility of studying antiferromagnetic ising and xy spin chains in linear ion traps , where quantum phase transitions can be induced and explored @xcite .",
    "we show that experiments with trapped ions can access the physics of magnetic quantum phases with an accuracy that is not possible in other experimental set - ups , and allow us to test general properties of quantum systems at , or near , criticality . on the other hand ,",
    "the effective spin hamiltonians that can be engineered with trapped ions show a few remarkable features , the most important one being the fact that spin ",
    "spin interactions follow power  law decays , something that induces long  range quantum correlations between distant ions , which are absent in the usual nearest  neighbor models .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in the first section",
    "we describe in detail our proposal , taking as a starting point the system formed by a set of trapped ions coupled to an off  resonant standing wave , and show that it realizes a system of effective interacting spins .",
    "we focus on the cases of ising and xy interactions . in the second section we study the many  body problem posed by the quantum ising model in ion traps . for this purpose",
    ", we make use of a quasi  exact numerical method , the so called density matrix renormalization group @xcite , and introduce also an analytical , approximate solution in terms of holstein  primakoff bosons .",
    "the third section deals with the study of the xy model in ion traps . finally , we present our conclusions .",
    "in this section we review the theoretical description of a set of trapped ions under the action of off  resonant standing waves presented in @xcite , and show that their quantum dynamics follows approximately that of quantum interacting spins .",
    "we also discuss carefully the effects of residual spin  phonon couplings .",
    "our proposal relies on an always - on coupling between internal states and vibrational modes , in such a way that phonons transmit an interaction between different ions .",
    "this paper deals , thus , with the theoretical description of a system of effective spins ( internal states ) coupled to a set of vibrational modes .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian has three contributions : @xmath0 @xmath1 describes the local dynamics of internal states , which are a set of independent effective spins under the action of effective global magnetic fields in each direction : @xmath2 note that @xmath3 is the energy of the internal state , and @xmath4 , @xmath5 can be implemented by the action of lasers resonant with the internal transition . in eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian.initial ] ) , @xmath6 is the vibrational hamiltonian , and @xmath7 is the internal state  phonon coupling . both terms are described in the following two subsections .",
    "we consider 1d systems of trapped ions , whose physical implementation corresponds to coulomb chains in linear paul traps or linear arrays of ion microtraps .",
    "let us assign @xmath8 to the axis of the ion chain , and @xmath9 , @xmath10 to the radial directions .",
    "the potential experienced by the ions is determined by the trapping frequencies , @xmath11 ( in the following the index @xmath12 always runs over the spatial directions , @xmath13 ) , and the coulomb repulsion : @xmath14 in the harmonic approximation we express @xmath15 as a function of the displacements around the equilibrium positions ( @xmath16 ) , up to quadratic terms : @xmath17 the corresponding hamiltonian can be diagonalized in terms of collective modes ( phonons ) : @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the momenta corresponding to @xmath20 .",

    "matrices @xmath24 in ( [ conditional.force ] ) diagonalize the vibrational hamiltonian : @xmath25 .",
    "the characteristics of the vibrational modes are governed by the following parameters , which quantify the relative value of coulomb interaction and trapping potentials : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mean distance between ions .",
    "if @xmath28 , then phonons are close to be localized at each ion ( stiff limit ) ; on the contrary @xmath29 ( soft limit ) implies that coulomb repulsion prevails over the trapping potential and , thus , phonons have a strong collective character that results in the ability to mediate interactions with a range of the order of the ion trap @xcite .",
    "we summarize below the description of vibrational modes in different trapping conditions :    * _ coulomb chains",
    "( paul traps ) .",
    "_ in this experimental set  up the equilibrium positions in the axial ( @xmath30 ) direction are determined by the coulomb interaction and the axial trapping , and @xmath31 depends only on the number of ions @xmath32 .",

    ". on the other hand , @xmath35 , can be reduced at will because one can increase the axial trapping frequencies @xmath36 while leaving constant the mean distance between ions , @xmath27 .",

    "_ it is worth considering this case here due to the experimental effort currently being devoted to the fabrication of linear arrays of ion traps where equilibrium positions of the ions are chosen by individual confinement potentials for each ion @xcite . in this case , all trapping frequencies @xmath38 can be chosen at will , and in particular condition @xmath39 can be also fulfilled opposite to the case of standard paul traps .",

    "dependent a.c.stark shift .",
    "several configurations are possible , in which internal states are coupled to vibrational modes that are transverse or longitudinal with respect to the trap axis . the characteristics of the resulting effective spin ",
    "spin interaction depends on the choice of the directions of the laser beams : in particular , axial vibrational modes mediate long  range interactions , with a range of the order of the ion chain , and radial modes mediate shorter range spin  spin interactions , with a power  law decay @xmath40 . due to the fact that short  range spin hamiltonians contain a rich quantum critical phenomenology , we focus in this work on this last situation .",
    "let us consider the following coupling between effective spins and radial motion : @xmath41 @xmath42 is the eigenstate of @xmath43 with eigenvalue @xmath44 .",
