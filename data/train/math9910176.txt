    "discontinuous behaviour in dissipative dynamical systems is often ascribed to the propinquity of a pitchfork , a codimension 2 singularity which requires two auxiliary parameters for a universal unfolding . in a 3-dimensional space labelled by the system",
    "parameters a universal unfolding forms a critical surface , or limit - point shell . _",
    "a priori _ knowledge of the topology of critical surfaces , and how they change with variation of other parameters ( i.e. , animation ) is a powerful aid in the design and optimization of dynamical systems and the control of jump , hysteresis , or oscillatory phenomena . in this",
    "work cartoons of computed bifurcation surfaces are used to visualize the pitchfork and its surroundings in parameter space .",
    "it is shown how these surfaces are shaped by the degree of symmetry and by the lower codimension antecedents of the pitchfork as the organizing centre , or highest order singularity , in particular bifurcation problems .",
    "a mathematical description of the pitchfork in singularity theory terms will be given in ",
    "[ s2 ] , for now the name itself will suffice as a working definition . the classic trident representation is simply a graph depicting how the number of something ( such as solutions of an equation , or states of an ideal ensemble ) changes from one to three as a control variable is made to cross a critical value . because of both its heuristic value in singularity theory and its importance in applied bifurcation problems ,",
    "the pitchfork has been described in many texts dealing with dynamics and bifurcations . a recent exposition with this flavour",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "pitchforks have been most often reported as bifurcations of the steady states of idealized systems possessing @xmath0 or reflectional symmetry .",
    "simple examples in this category include studies of the driven pendulum @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and variations on the buckling beam problem @xcite , @xcite . in these systems , which are also called imperfect bifurcation problems ,",
    "symmetry - breaking perturbations dissolve the pitchfork leaving behind persistent limit points where discontinuous action may occur . in more complicated problems the symmetric pitchfork occurs as a bifurcation of periodic solutions @xcite , or",
    "may be embedded in a higher - order degeneracy @xcite .",
    "although the presence of a pitchfork in a mathematical model can sometimes be interpreted as _ prima facie _ evidence or diagnostic of @xmath0 invariance , there are also many bifurcation problems containing non - symmetric pitchforks . in some problems of this type a",
    "fully unfolded or perturbed pitchfork is intrinsic to a minimal description of the associated physical system .",
    "thermokinetic and isothermal chemical systems are the most widely studied in this category ; a good introduction to these is found in @xcite .",
    "a partially unfolded pitchfork occurs in other non - symmetric problems , with a single static perturbation required to complete a realistic description of the system .",
    "two recent examples are a model for l(low)h(high ) confinement state transitions in plasmas @xcite and experimental and numerical studies of an electronic van der pol oscillator @xcite .    with recent advances in inertial manifold theory @xcite ,",
    "it is likely that the pitchfork in general will also appear in the dynamics of infinite - dimensional systems that exhibit low - dimensional behaviour on a long time - scale .    in this paper several bifurcation problems",
    "will be discussed and compared to exemplify the qualities of pitchfork manifolds in the different categories : ( 1 ) the prototypic universal unfolding of the pitchfork , ( 2 ) a well - known thermokinetic system , ( 3 ) the simplest universal unfolding of a non - symmetric pitchfork , and ( 4 ) the l  h transition problem mentioned above .",
    "bifurcation surfaces can also illuminate rather dramatically the truism that what you see depends on where you view the object from .",
    "originally the pitchfork was described from an orthogonal point of view as the generic cusp , and in  [ s2 ] we work around to the prototypic pitchfork beginning from the more familiar cusp manifold . moving from the non - generic surface of equilibrium points or steady states , up a dimension to the invariant surface of fold points ,",
    "the limit - point shell @xmath1 of the prototypic pitchfork is presented as a fundamental , generic object . in  [ s3 ] the limit - point shell of the cstr problem , @xmath2 ( first described in @xcite and @xcite ) , and that of the simplest non - symmetric pitchfork , @xmath3 , are compared .",
    "some curious features of the extraordinary limit - point shell of the l  h problem , @xmath4 are also described in ",
    "[ s4 ] concludes with a brief discussion of what these result imply for the design and control of experimental dynamical systems .",
    "in 1955 hassler whitney published the first exposition of singularity theory @xcite , in which he derived conditions for a regular point @xmath5 of a smooth mapping @xmath6 from @xmath7 into @xmath7 to be a cusp point . in coordinates @xmath8 , @xmath9 these are @xmath10 at @xmath5 .",
    "whitney proved that any mapping containing a point at which the conditions ( [ cc ] ) are satisfied can be transformed by coordinate changes into the following normal form for the cusp : @xmath11 subsequently ren thom listed the cusp , which he called the riemann - hugoniot catastrophe , as the second of the famous ( i mean , of course , infamous ) seven elementary catastrophes @xcite . in catastrophe theory the normal form ( [ nfc ] ) becomes the universal unfolding @xmath12 of the germ @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the gradient of a corresponding governing potential @xmath16 .",
    "the familiar cusp surface , @xmath17 , and the projection of the folds on the @xmath18 plane are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the surface may be viewed as the lateral unfurling of a path in the @xmath19 plane into @xmath20 .",
    "three qualitatively different paths  slices of the cusp surface at constant @xmath20 or bifurcation diagrams  are sketched in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "although the cusp is generic , in the sense that all other singularities may be perturbed to either a fold or a cusp @xcite , the surface in figure [ fig1 ] is not a unique manifold of the cusp catastrophe .",
    "since all paths through the cusp unfolding ( [ uuc ] ) are equally valid , we may choose a path in the @xmath21 plane .",
    "any such path unfurls laterally into @xmath22 to form another surface , shown from two points of view in figure [ fig3 ] together with the projection of the folds on the @xmath18 plane .",
    "three qualitatively different bifurcation diagrams are shown in figure [ fig4 ] , whence we finally arrive at the classical pitchfork .    returning to whitney",
    "s original defining conditions for the cusp , equations ( [ cc ] ) , we see now that they also define the pitchfork .",
    "the surface in figure [ fig3 ] is non - generic , because it does not represent _ all _ qualitative information about the pitchfork .",
    "golubitsky and schaeffer @xcite proved that a universal unfolding of the pitchfork must include a fourth variable .",
    "their classification of singularities by codimension and derivation of universal unfoldings has the contextual setting of bifurcations of steady states in autonomous dynamical systems dependent on parameters : @xmath23 here @xmath24 is the dynamical state variable , @xmath25 is the principal bifurcation parameter and the @xmath26 are auxiliary or unfolding parameters . assuming henceforth this context and notation , the pitchfork conditions @xmath27 are given in table [ table1 ] , column 2 . a bifurcation problem which satisfies @xmath27",
    "is said to be locally equivalent to the normal form @xmath28 the prototypic universal unfolding of the pitchfork , @xmath29 , is given as @xmath30 a nave interpretation of the concept of a universal unfolding is more useful here than a rigorous definition or derivation .",
    "we apply the conditions @xmath27 to the unfolding @xmath31 ( this is a partial unfolding of ( [ nfp ] ) ; compare equation ( [ uuc ] ) . )",
    "the result comprises an overdetermined system of four equations in three variables . if we perturb ( [ part ] ) at @xmath32 by adding the term @xmath33 , the bifurcation diagram acquires qualitatively different characteristics , as indicated in figure [ fig5 ] .",
    "however , more perturbations , or different perturbations , do not introduce any more qualitative differences to the bifurcation diagram .",
    "( note : it can be guessed that universal unfoldings are not necessarily unique . )    for any value of @xmath34 the bifurcation surface of @xmath29 formed by unfolding a path in the @xmath35 plane into @xmath36 does not , therefore , include the pitchfork .",
    "two views of this surface for @xmath37 are shown in figure [ fig6 ] along with the projection of the folds on the @xmath38 plane .",
    "the famous five bifurcation diagrams for the universal unfolding @xmath29 are given in figure  [ fig7 ] .",
    "there are two singularities on the fold lines of figure [ fig6](b ) , a hysteresis point @xmath39 and a transcritical point @xmath40 , definitions of which are given in in table [ table1 ] columns 2 and 3 .",
    "it is evident from these definitions and from the surface for the partial unfolding in figure [ fig3 ] that the pitchfork is the limiting degeneracy of @xmath39 and @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "a unique , continuous manifold @xmath1 around @xmath29 is obtained by unfurling the _ fold _ lines in the @xmath38 plane into @xmath42 .",
    "this forms a limit - point shell , the surface of fold or limit points of an unfolding .",
    "@xmath1 is shown from four vantage points in figure [ fig8 ] .",
    "it is a self - contained and unique manifold around @xmath29 ; it can not be translated , rotated , deformed or punctured .",
    "let us inspect it closely .",
    "a slice of the surface at constant @xmath43 is simply the fold lines in figure [ fig6](b ) .",
    "there is a distinct seam of hysteresis points that runs from positive to negative @xmath42 and negative to positive @xmath36 through the pitchfork at @xmath44 .",
    "less obvious is the line of trancritical points , which lies along @xmath45 in the @xmath46 plane .",
    "the shell is symmetric about two reflections : reflect it in a vertical mirror plane through @xmath41 , then reflect it again in a horizontal mirror plane through @xmath32 .",
    "in dynamical models the limit - point shell outlines the boundary and extent of steady - state multiplicity over the parameter space .",
    "therefore , the shape of a limit point shell is an important consideration in predictive work , because it is a guide in the selection of design criteria and operating conditions for an experimental system .",
    "however , @xmath1 is a poor metaphor for many models which contain a pitchfork .",
    "a specific limit - point shell is shaped by the presence and location of other bifurcations and by the symmetry of the problem . in this section",
    "these ideas are illustrated by comparing the limit point shells of three bifurcation problems which have pitchforks as organizing centres .",
    "interest has been maintained in this thermokinetic system since the 1950s , because it posesses a combination of unusual dynamical properties and real - world experimental accessibility .",
    "the first singularity theory study of the cstr problem can be found in @xcite and a recent alternative treatment is given in @xcite .",
    "the simplest cstr model describes an exothermal chemical reaction occurring in a well - stirred bounded medium . as a bifurcation problem",
    "it may be written as follows : @xmath47 the state variable is the temperature @xmath22 which depends on a number of parameters : @xmath6 , an input rate ; @xmath48 , the coupled temperature of the thermostat and the input ; @xmath49 , the thermal dissipation rate ; and @xmath50 , the intrinsic properties of the medium . for",
    "@xmath51 it can be shown that an organizing centre is the pitchfork @xmath52 , although the system has no symmetries .",
    "the limit point shell @xmath2 at a fixed value of @xmath49 is shown in figure [ fig9 ] .",
    "( _ note : _ a detailed discussion of this structure may be found in @xcite .",
    "the dynamical cstr problem also contains hopf bifurcations , the manifold of which will be discussed elsewhere . )",
    "contrasted with @xmath1 , the prototypic limit point shell of figure [ fig8 ] , the overall qualities of @xmath2 appear to be _ asymmetry _ and _",
    "convexity_.      table [ table1 ] shows that embedded in the pitchfork are the codimension 1 bifurcations @xmath39 and @xmath40 _ or _",
    "@xmath53 , or @xmath39 and @xmath40 _ and _ @xmath53 , since @xmath40 and @xmath53 are distinguished only by the sign of the non - degeneracy condition @xmath54 .",
    "for the prototypic unfolding , @xmath29 , we find that @xmath55 and @xmath56 , @xmath57 at @xmath58 , thus @xmath40 but not @xmath53 is embedded in @xmath29 .",
    "for the cstr problem it is shown in appendix a that both @xmath40 _ and _ @xmath53 are embedded in @xmath52 .    the last column in table [ table1 ] gives conditions for another codimension 2 bifurcation , the asymmetric cusp @xmath59 . in appendix",
    "a it is shown that this singularity is also present in the cstr problem .",
    "@xmath59 is too inconspicuous to be pinpointed visually on the portion of @xmath2 shown in figure [ fig9 ] , but it is easily approximated numerically as @xmath60 at @xmath61 .",
    "nevertheless , the form of @xmath2 is strongly sculpted by the presence of @xmath59 .",
    "one of the greatest strengths of singularity theory is that it defines criteria by which two algebraic systems have equivalent solution sets .",
    "singularity theory tells us that the cstr problem is qualitatively equivalent to the simplest universal unfolding of a bifurcation problem containing @xmath27 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath53 , and @xmath59 .",
    "this is designated @xmath62 : @xmath63 evaluation of @xmath40 and @xmath53 embedded in @xmath62 and @xmath59 ( appendix b ) indicates that the bifurcation behaviour of the cstr problem is completely encapsulated in the simpler problem @xmath62 .",
    "the limit point shell @xmath3 of @xmath62 is viewed from two vantage points in figure  [ fig10 ] , and it appears to tell a different story .",
    "all of the qualitatively distinct bifurcation diagrams of the cstr can indeed be recovered from various slices of @xmath3  for example , figure [ fig11 ] shows the isolated branch of solutions that also exists in the cstr .",
    "however , the qualitative differences between the two limit - point shells are quite striking",
    ". we could not use @xmath62 to predict the boundaries of multiplicity in the cstr .",
    "an important issue in the physics of magnetically confined plasmas is the dramatic jump to an improved confinement rgime , known as the l ",
    "h transition , that occurs at critical values of tunable parameters or internal system properties . a phenomenological model that described this critical behaviour @xcite was analysed by ball and dewar @xcite and found to contain a partially unfolded pitchfork .",
    "the simplest universal unfolding for this bifurcation problem was derived as : @xmath64 where @xmath22 is the state variable , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath36 are parameters and @xmath67 and @xmath68 are numerical factors having the values 0.05 and 0.95 respectively . in the model , @xmath22 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 @xmath69 .",
    "( _ note : _ the dynamical l - h model also contains hopf bifurcations , which will be discussed elsewhere . )    unusually , although there is a degenerate pitchfork in the original partially unfolded ( or overdetermined ) problem with @xmath32 , the universal unfolding @xmath70 contains _ two _ pitchforks in the real , physical space .",
    "they are found exactly by applying the conditions @xmath27 in table [ table1 ] to  @xmath70 : @xmath71 this introduces a formidable global aspect to what hitherto has been a purely local focus on the structure of the limit - point shell around a _",
    "unique _ pitchfork .",
    "a bifurcation analysis of @xmath70 and construction of the limit - point shell is clearly not for the faint - hearted , because it is difficult to imagine the topological nightmares that must exist to connect @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "one can begin by searching for lower - order and same - order bifurcations ; the conditions for @xmath40 and @xmath53 yield : @xmath74 with @xmath75 given by real roots of @xmath76 . from the condition @xmath77 we can infer that the bifurcation is transcritical , and since @xmath22 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 @xmath78 it is required that @xmath79 at this point .",
    "the conditions for @xmath39 evaluate to expressions too complicated to be useful .",
    "there does not appear to be an asymmetric cusp in the problem .",
    "another , related complication is the existence of a _ third _ pitchfork in the unphysical region @xmath80 , @xmath81 .",
    "it is given by @xmath82 @xmath83 is important because part of its limit - point manifold intrudes into the physical parameter region and is connected to the limit - point manifold of @xmath72 by a seam of hysteresis points .",
    "this curved seam can be seen in figure [ fig12 ] , a fragment of the limit - point shell of @xmath70 around the connection . in figure",
    "[ fig13 ] a series of slices taken in the @xmath84 plane illustrate how the connection occurs .",
    "the putative condition for _ pe  pe _ contact of the two hysteresis points in figure  [ fig13 ] , a singularity designated @xmath85 , appears to be @xmath86 this condition yields a single exact @xmath85 point : @xmath87 at which @xmath88 and @xmath89",
    ". the conditions ( [ e2 ] ) for the @xmath85 singularity seem pathological , but they can be understood by referring to the surface in figure [ fig12 ] and considering the the singularities defined in table [ table1 ] . at the hysteresis points , @xmath39 , @xmath90 , and this condition holds at @xmath85 ( since it is not a pitchfork ) .",
    "however , another derivative must be zero at the union of two degenerate points , this is the condition @xmath91 .",
    "the above analysis highlights the pitfalls of accepting qualitative equivalence of a bifurcation problem to a normal form as , in some sense , a `` solution '' . in the case of the cstr problem and its normal form ,",
    "the boundaries of multiplicity are profoundly different .",
    "the analysis of the l ",
    "h problem also hints at the bizarre and interesting features that a limit - point shell can have while still remaining continuous .",
    "although @xmath4 is locally equivalent to @xmath1 around each of the three pitchforks , the global definition of @xmath4 involves at least one new singularity , @xmath85 .",
    "this is largely an interpretive and exploratory work , investigating the local and global environment of the pitchfork through the limit - point shell and using prototypic normal forms and real - world bifurcation problems as examples .",
    "it turns out that bifurcation problems containing an organizing centre as simple as the pitchfork can have rather complex boundaries of multiplicity . for this reason , and given the increasing availability of 3-dimensional computer visualization techniques , the limit - point shell has enormous potential as a design and control aid for experimental dynamical systems .",
