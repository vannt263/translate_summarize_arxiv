    "there are two main techniques to hunt for high - redshift star - forming galaxies , the dropout technique and the ly@xmath11-line search technique .",
    "the former is known as the lyman - break technique @xcite , and is applied using deep broadband images wherein high - redshift galaxies are identified via a flux discontinuity caused by absorption from neutral gas in the inter - galactic medium ( igm ) .",
    "the latter method is designed to search for the strong ly@xmath11  emission line , using deep narrowband images to identify galaxies where the ly@xmath11  line is redshifted to windows of low night - sky emission .",
    "the ly@xmath11  emitters ( laes ) are typically younger , lower mass , less dusty , and more compact than lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) . compared to the lyman - break technique , the ly@xmath11  technique can select galaxies within a small redshift range ( @xmath2512% ) , which is more sensitive to the large - scale structure implied from the simulation work .    as a prominent tracer of ionizing photons ,",

    "<S> compared to the blank field detected with the other two narrowband filters nb470 and nb475 , the lae density excess in nb466 ( 900 arcmin@xmath2 ) is @xmath3 6.0@xmath40.8 times the standard deviation expected at @xmath5 , assuming a linear bias of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the overdense large scale structure in nb466 can be decomposed into 4 protoclusters , whose overdensities ( each within an equivalent comoving volume @xmath6 mpc@xmath7 ) relative to the blank field ( nb470+nb475 ) are in the range of 4.66.6 . these 4 protoclusters are expected to evolve into a coma - like cluster ( @xmath8 10@xmath9 m@xmath10 ) at @xmath1 0 . in the meanwhile , we investigate the various properties of laes at @xmath02.82.9 and their dependence on the environment . </S>",
    "<S> the average star - formation rates derived from ly@xmath11 , rest - frame uv and x - ray are @xmath34 , 10 , and @xmath1216 m@xmath10/yr , respectively , implying a ly@xmath11  escape fraction of 25% @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath13 40% and a uv continuum escape fraction of @xmath15 @xmath16 62% for laes at @xmath17@xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> the ly@xmath11  photon density calculated from the integrated ly@xmath11  luminosity function in the overdense field ( nb466 ) is @xmath350% higher than that in the blank field ( nb470+nb475 ) , and more bright laes are found in the overdense field . </S>",
    "<S> the 3 brightest laes , including a quasar at @xmath02.81 , are all detected in x - ray and in nb466 . </S>",
    "<S> these three lae - agns contribute an extra 2030% ly@xmath11  photon density compared with that from other lae galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we find that laes in overdense regions have larger ew values , bluer @xmath19-@xmath20 and @xmath21-@xmath22 ( @xmath323@xmath23 ) colors compared with those in lower density regions , indicating that laes in overdense regions are younger and possible less dusty . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the structure at @xmath17@xmath32.8 in the ecdfs field is a very significant and rare density peak similar to the ssa 22 protocluster , and narrowband imaging is an efficient method of detecting and studying such structures in the high-@xmath17 universe . </S>"
