    "the past few decades have been extremely fruitful in terms of advancing our understanding about the local group ( lg ) , both on the level of individual galaxies , and the lg at large ( van den bergh 2000 ) .",
    "this was facilitated by the deployment of hst , large ground - based telescopes ( vlt , keck , subaru , gemini ) and new instrumentation ( especially wide field cameras and multi - object spectrographs ) , crucial for studies of faint stellar populations in the lg galaxies .",
    "gaia will be a powerful tool to study formation and evolution of the milky way , but apart from this it will also provide a wealth of information on individual stars ( giants and supergiants ) in distant stellar populations , such as galaxies of the lg .",
    "however , given the fast development of new observational facilities , especially those foreseen to come into operation already within @xmath410 years , it is crucial to understand whether and what gaia may contribute in this rapidly evolving field of research in 1015 years from now .",
    "we attempt to address this question briefly in the forthcoming pages .",
    ".local group galaxies within 300kpc from the sun [ cols=\"<,<,<,^,^ \" , ]     notes : morphological types and distances are from grebel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , core and tidal radii are from mateo ( 1998 ) .",
    "apparent diameters at 25 magnitude isophote are given for lmc and smc ( leda database , http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr/search.html ) .",
    "a list of nearby lg galaxies which may be accessible with gaia is given in table 1 .",
    "it is obvious that a comprehensive study of the nearby lg galaxies requires instrumentation with high sensitivity and large field of view ( fov ) , as most of them occupy large areas on the sky ( note that stellar populations of dwarf galaxies may extend to several apparent radii , see e.g. vanseviius et al .",
    "2004 , thus covering an area of several square degrees on the sky ) .",
    "the demand for high sensitivity will imply the use of largest telescopes available ; however , their fovs are prohibitively small compared to the spatial extent of lg galaxies , especially the nearby ones .",
    "thus current studies of lg dwarfs are mostly limited to small areas in individual galaxies ( typically - their central parts ) .",
    "the outer edges of dwarf galaxies , however , are extremely interesting , as they may contain important imprints about the formation and evolution of individual galaxies , as well as their interaction with other galaxies in the lg ( spatial gradients in star formation and chemical enrichment histories , kinematical properties , etc . ) .",
    "however , field contamination becomes increasingly important at larger radii , thus membership information ( typically based on kinematical properties ) is crucial to distinguish galactic populations from the field stars .",
    "current kinematical studies of lg galaxies are mostly based on radial velocities , which are possible only for brightest giants and supergiants with 8-m class telescopes .",
    "several studies have aimed recently at obtaining proper motions of individual stars in nearby lg galaxies , but : ( 1 ) the accuracy is low , mainly due to the relatively short time span between the measurement epochs , ( 2 ) studies of this kind require 8-m class telescopes ( or hst ) to ensure the required spatial resolution - which , given today s situation , means small fovs again .",
    "thus , astrometry of lg galaxies presently remains limited to small selected areas in the most nearby galaxies .",
    "star formation histories of the nearby lg galaxies are relatively well understood ( e.g. , aparicio 2004 ; grebel 2000 ) , as their main sequence turn - off point ( msto ) stars are well within reach with currently available telescopes ( see fig.2 , which illustrates the possibilities with currently available instrumentation ) .",
    "knowledge is accumulating gradually about their chemical enrichment histories too , primarily with the aid of new multi - object spectrographs on 8-m class telescopes ( e.g. , venn et al .",
    "2004 ; shetrone et al .",
    "2003 ; tolstoy et al .",
    "indeed , the majority of these investigations are confined to the central parts of individual galaxies ( or several selected areas at different radial distances ) , which is imposed again by the limited fovs of currently available instrumentation .",
    "considerable advances can be expected in all of these fields with the large area surveys which will be carried out in the near future using new wide - field telescopes ( table  2 ) .",
    "although far from being complete , the list in table  2 gives a clear indication that the fovs of available instrumentation will increase dramatically in @xmath4510 years from now , thus a few pointings will be sufficient to cover areas extending to several square degrees on the sky .",
    "combined with the high sensitivity ( 8-m class telescope in case of lsst ! ) , this will provide excellent possibilities for studying even the outermost parts of the lg galaxies in a routine way .",

    ".    radial velocities will be considerably more difficult with gaia , as sufficient precision may be achieved only for stars brighter than @xmath62 , or up to the distances of @xmath63kpc ( table  3 ; @xmath480kpc with agb stars , @xmath64 ) . indeed",
    ", bright supergiants may be accessible at considerably larger distances ( table  3 ) , however , they will be available only in a few galaxies , as stellar populations in the majority of nearby lg galaxies are old , showing no signs for recent star formation ( aparicio 2002 ) .",

    "gaia will also provide precise astrophysical parameters for a number of individual stars in nearby lg galaxies , from the medium - band photometry ( see jordi & hg , this volume ) .",
    "this will be indeed an important contribution since so far neither spectroscopy nor medium - band photometry is planned with the deep ground - based wide - field surveys ( note though , that the former may be possible with the prime - focus multi - object spectrographs on 8-m class telescopes in the near future , e.g. , fmos on subaru ; and the implementation of the latter is a straightforward task ) .",
    "the availability of precise astrophysical parameters may also allow to study star formation histories of individual galaxies using rgb / agb stars ( kuinskas et al .",

    ", these instruments will be serious competitors for gaia , especially if backed - up with the capability for multi - color medium - band photometry and multi - object spectroscopy .",
    "however , the superiority of gaia will be in the high accuracy and homogeneity of its data .",
    "gaia will provide precise information both on kinematical and astrophysical properties of individual stars , obtained with a single , stable and well - calibrated instrument .",
    "moreover , the data will be acquired in the same instrumental system as for the millions of stars in the milky way .",
    "this will deliver an unique and homogeneous data set , which will allow to perform a comprehensive and in - depth analysis of the formation and evolution of the lg galaxies .",
