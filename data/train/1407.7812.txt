    "in spite of the amount of precise cosmological data and good concordance between different observations , understanding the two dominant cosmic components , dark matter and dark energy , is still in order .",
    "there are suggestions of unifying the dark sector , and a known example is the generalised chaplygin gas model , in which the dark sector is described by a unique component with density @xmath6 and negative pressure @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants @xcite . in early times",
    "it behaves like pressureless matter , and tends to a cosmological constant in the asymptotic future .",
    "however , the presence of unobserved oscillations and instabilities in the gas power spectrum was soon realised @xcite .",
    "the possibility of unified descriptions of the dark sector is related to the so called dark degeneracy , i.e. the fact that the dark components are not uniquely defined @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , in a recent paper @xcite it was argued that in observational tests it is necessary to properly define the clustering component of the dark sector , the component observed in large scale structures .",
    "any dark fluid , unified or not , can be mapped into two interacting components , the first with zero pressure ( here named dark matter ) and the other with equation of state @xmath10 ( here called dark energy ) .",
    "it was shown that , if the former is non - relativistic , the latter does not cluster and , hence , the defined dark matter can be identified with clustering matter . in this case , the dark matter power spectrum does not suffer from oscillations or instabilities , which are avoided owing to the presence of late - time entropic perturbations related to the energy flux between the components .",
    "these results apply in particular to the generalised chaplygin gas ( gcg ) .",
    "its split into two interacting components permits the identification of its clustering part and hence a proper analysis of observations @xcite .",
    "the clustering component has no oscillations or instabilities in its power spectrum .",
    "the gcg parameter @xmath1 determines the rate of energy flux between the components , with a negative @xmath1 meaning creation of dark matter at the expenses of dark energy .",
    "in this paper we perform an observational analysis of the non - adiabatic gcg , by testing it against precise cosmological observations , namely the hubble diagram of type ia supernovas ( sne ia ) , the position of the first acoustic peak in the anisotropy spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the distribution of large scale structures ( lss ) . for the latter we will consider the data from the 2dfgrs catalogue @xcite . for supernovae we will take two different compilations , the constitution and sdss samples , both calibrated with the mlcs2k2 fitter @xcite .",
    "this choice is to avoid any bias resulting from the use of a fiducial @xmath3cdm model in the supernovae calibration , the case for instance of the union2 compilation that is calibrated with the salt2 fitter @xcite .",
    "our joint analysis leads to the best - fit value @xmath11 .",
    "this corresponds to a constant - rate dark matter creation , with the dark energy density decreasing linearly with the hubble parameter @xcite . on the other hand , the value @xmath4",
    ", corresponding to the @xmath3cdm model , is comparatively rulled out , standing outside the 3@xmath12 confidence interval .",
    "this might constitute , possibly for the first time , an evidence of particles creation at cosmological scale .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the dark degeneracy and the mapping of any general model of the dark sector into interacting two - component models . in section [ gcg ]",
    "we particularise these results to the non - adiabatic gcg . in section [ observations ]",
    "we describe the performed observational tests , and the results are presented and discussed in section [ results ] , followed by conclusions in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "consider a dark fluid with equation of state @xmath13 , with @xmath14 .",
    "split this fluid into two components , one called dark matter , with zero pressure , and the other named dark energy , with equation of state @xmath15 .",
    "with help of the friedmann equation . ]",
    "@xmath16 , it is not difficult to show that @xmath17 these components will in general interact .",
    "let us define the rate of energy flux between them as @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the scale factor and @xmath20 defines the dark matter particle number density . for non - relativistic matter , ( [ rate ] )",
    "can also be written as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the dark matter density . by using ( [ 11 ] ) ,",
    "@xmath23 and the energy conservation equation @xmath24 it is possible to show that the energy - flux rate is @xcite @xmath25    the momentum transfer between the components is null in the isotropic background .",
    "if it is negligible at the perturbation level , we can prove that the dark energy component does not cluster @xcite .",
    "this is true , in particular , if dark matter is non - relativistic .",
    "therefore , the dark matter component can be identified with the observed clustering matter .",
    "this identification is necessary for observational tests involving the distribution of lss , as we shall discuss in section [ observations ] .",
    "this result also guarantees that the dark matter power spectrum will not have oscillations or instabilities caused by pressure perturbations .",
    "indeed , for any perfect fluid the evolution equation for the gravitational potential is given by @xcite @xmath26\\phi_b = 0\\,,\\ ] ] where the prime means derivative with respect to @xmath19 , @xmath27 is the bardeen gauge - invariant potential , @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the perturbation comoving wavenumber , @xmath30 defines the adiabatic sound velocity , and @xmath31 is the effective sound velocity . if the dark energy component does not cluster , we have @xmath32 , leading to @xmath33",
    ". therefore , the term proportional to @xmath29 in ( [ tam ] ) will be zero and the spectrum will be smooth .",
    "the difference between @xmath34 and @xmath35 means that the decomposed dark fluid is non - adiabatic .",
    "using ( [ eos ] ) in the energy conservation equation ( [ 26 ] ) we obtain @xmath36^{\\frac{1}{1+\\alpha}},\\ ] ] where @xmath37 is the present gcg energy density and @xmath38 .",
    "this density scales with @xmath39 for @xmath40 and tends to a constant when @xmath41 .",
    "that is , at early times the gas behaves like dust matter , and tends to a cosmological constant in the asymptotic future .",
    "with @xmath4 we reobtain the @xmath3cdm model , with @xmath42 . from ( [ eos ] )",
    "we can derive the equation - of - state parameter @xmath43 and hence the adiabatic sound speed @xmath44 by differentiating @xmath13 we obtain @xmath45 substituting into ( [ 26 ] ) it follows that @xmath46    the gas can now be split into two interacting components like in the previous section , @xmath47 , @xmath48 . substituting ( [ 27 ] ) into ( [ 14 ] ) we obtain the rate of matter creation , @xmath49 since @xmath23 , we have , from ( [ 29 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) , @xmath50 while , from ( [ 11 ] ) and ( [ 29 ] ) , it is easy to obtain @xmath51 since @xmath52 ( from ( [ eos ] ) ) , we can see that @xmath53 and , therefore , @xmath54 . for @xmath4",
    "we reobtain the @xmath3cdm model , with @xmath55 and a constant @xmath56 . when @xmath57 we have energy flux from dark energy to dark matter , since @xmath58 .",
    "for @xmath59 we have the particular case of a constant @xmath60 , and @xmath56 decreases linearly with @xmath61 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the split gas presents late - time non - adiabatic perturbations owing to the interaction between the components .",
    "this prevents the appearance of oscillations and instabilities present in the power spectrum of the adiabatic gcg @xcite , provided that the dark energy component is unperturbed @xcite .",
    "it was explicitly shown in @xcite that this is true in the case @xmath59 .",
    "when testing the gcg against observations , we have to identify the clustering part of the gas to be compared to the observed amount of matter in galaxies and clusters . as discussed above",
    ", this identification is unique if we split the gas as in sections [ dd ] and [ gcg ] .",
    "we have seen that in this case the evolution equation ( [ tam ] ) does not depend on @xmath29 , which means that the profile of the dark matter power spectrum will depend essentially on the value of @xmath62 , the comoving horizon scale at the time of matter - radiation equality . by taking the limit @xmath63 in ( [ rho ] )",
    "we obtain , for the early - time matter density , @xmath64 comparing with the standard expression @xmath65 ( case @xmath4 ) we see that , for the same amount of matter at high redshifts , we have more ( less ) matter today for a negative ( positive ) @xmath1 .",
    "this is expected because of the late - time matter creation ( annihilation ) . with ( [ highz ] ) and by using for radiation @xmath66 , we obtain the redshift of matter - radiation equality , @xmath67 hence , with the use of @xmath68 , we have @xmath69 where @xmath70 mpc is the present hubble radius , and we are fixing the present radiation density parameter at the standard value @xmath71 . for @xmath4",
    "the above expressions are reduced to the standard model ones ( see , for instance , equation ( 7.39 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . the present power spectrum is , apart from a normalisation constant , given by @xmath72 , if we take the scalar spectral index @xmath73 .",

    "the spectrum is just amplified , and for its normalisation we use the observed spectrum at small scales .",

    "the density parameters of baryons and photons , to be used in the calculation of the sound speed in the baryon - photon plasma , will be fixed at the same values of the standard model , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "finally , when testing the distance - redshift relation of type ia supernovae , the calibration method has special relevance .",

    "the present matter density is in agreement with concordance tests with @xmath1 fixed as @xmath107 , which have given @xmath78 @xcite .",

    "we show the spectrum of the @xmath3cdm concordance model ( solid red line ) .",
    "the gcg best fit corresponds to a universe age @xmath109 gyr ( for @xmath110 ) @xcite .",
    "the value @xmath4 , which corresponds to the @xmath3cdm model , is rulled out in comparison with the best fit , standing outside the @xmath5 confidence interval ( see , however , ref .",
    "this agrees with previous tests in which @xmath1 was fixed as zero and that gave high values of @xmath111 for the sdss and constitution samples @xcite .",
    "this relatively poor concordance reflects the fact that the matter density obtained with lss alone is @xmath77 @xcite , while the best fit obtained with sne ia tests using the constitution and sdss samples calibrated with mlcs2k2 gives @xmath112 and @xmath113 , respectively ( see table ii of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . as we have discussed in the previous section",
    ", lss tests strongly depend on the matter density at high redshifts , while sne ia probes are sensitive to the matter density at low redshifts .",
    "therefore , this tension between the lss and sne ia values of @xmath114 may suggest a late - time process of matter creation .    in the last two lines of table",
    "i we show , for comparison , the joint analysis results when we use the sdss and union2.1 samples of sne ia calibrated with salt2 .",
    "as antecipated in the previous section , the results are moved towards @xmath4 . however , the @xmath3cdm model ( @xmath4 ) is still outside the @xmath5 confidence intervals . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we show the corresponding probability distribution functions after marginalising over @xmath115 and @xmath114 .     for the joint analysis of sne ia + lss + cmb .",
    "the solid ( dashed ) line corresponds to union2.1 ( sdss ) supernovae sample calibrated with salt2.,height=226 ]    to finish this analysis we need to comment about the power spectrum normalisation .",
    "since the dark energy component does not cluster , the dark matter production is homogeneous , and this causes a late - time suppression of the dark matter density contrast @xmath116 ( see the left panel of fig . 3 in ref .",
    "so , why is the spectrum normalisation not affected ? to answer this question ,",
    "let us remark that we observe the baryonic power spectrum , not the dark matter one .",
    "since baryons are conserved , no suppression in their spectrum is expected , although it presents the same profile as the dark matter spectrum , determined by @xmath117 .",
    "this can also be understood if we remember that the baryons distribution follows the gravitational potential , which is determined ( via poisson s equation ) by the dark matter perturbations @xmath118 , not by the contrast @xmath119 itself .",
    "the reader can see in the right panel of fig . 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite that the gravitational potential for @xmath59 presents approximately the same strength and evolution as in the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "this guarantees , by the way , that the cmb power spectrum will also have the correct normalisation .",
    "an analysis of the @xmath59 case with the inclusion of conserved baryons can be found in @xcite .",
    "a study of non - linear collapse in this model was recently done in @xcite .",
    "models with interaction in the dark sector have been proposed for a long time ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in ref . @xcite it was shown that , in fact , any dark sector model can be mapped into a non - adiabatic fluid with energy flux between the dark energy and dark matter components .",
    "choosing , on the basis of observations , a specific interaction inside this class of models is a difficult task , since the rate @xmath60 is a general function , related to the function @xmath120 by eq .",
    ". this task becames simpler if we particularise the dark sector to a non - adiabatic gcg , since now the rate @xmath60 , given by ( [ 30 ] ) , is known up to the constant parameter @xmath1 , which can be determined from observations .",
    "our analysis has led to a constant rate of matter creation , which corresponds to a dark energy density that decays linearly with the hubble parameter .",
    "interestingly enough , a linear dependence on @xmath61 is expected from estimations of the energy density of the qcd vacuum condensate in the flrw spacetime @xcite . on the other hand , from ( [ 28 ] ) it is easy to see that the obtained constant rate is equal to @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is the hubble parameter in the de sitter limit . in other words ,",
    "the creation rate is equal , apart from a factor of the order of unity , to the gibbons - hawking temperature of the future de sitter horizon .",
    "we have also seen that the @xmath3cdm model is comparatively rulled out , an evidence in favor of matter creation at cosmological scale . this evidence may be confirmed with future observations , in which the discrepancies between the standard and interacting models will be more evident .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite a slightly higher number density of high mass structures is predicted for @xmath59 as compared to the standard case .",
    "although inside the error bars of present observations , this difference may be tested in future surveys like j - pas @xcite and erosita @xcite .",
