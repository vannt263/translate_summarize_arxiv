    "in a seminal paper appeared a quarter century ago , englander , kallenbach , heeger , krumhansl and litwin @xcite suggested that dna solitons , i.e. nonlinear mechanical excitations of the dna double helix , could have a key role in dna functional processes  such as dna transcription and replication  in that they would provide automatic focusing of energy and synchronization of opening along the chain .",
    "they also were the first to suggest a simple mechanical model to illustrate their argument ; this consisted of a one - dimensional chain of simple pendulums , each of them coupled to the neighboring ones . in this way travelling solitons were described by the sine - gordon equation , which is known to support both topological and dynamical solitons .",
    "( note that , contrary to the davydov soliton in alpha - helices @xcite which is intrinsically quantum , in this case we deal with classical mechanics and hence classical solitons . )    following the suggestion of englander et al .",
    ", a number of models for the nonlinear dynamics of dna have been elaborated by different scientists in later years .",
    "research was pursued essentially in two directions : on the one hand , in dna _ denaturation _ the relevant aspect is the separation between the two helices , and one looks mainly at the degree of freedom describing distance between the two bases in a ( watson - crick ) pair .",
    "considerable progress in this direction has been obtained via the model introduced by peyrard and bishop @xcite ; this has then been refined by dauxois @xcite and extended in the bcp model by barbi , cocco and peyrard @xcite ( related models are discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "see e.g. @xcite for a discussion of results and recent advances in this direction , and @xcite for matters related to ( thermodynamic ) stability and bubble formation .",
    "on the other hand , models for the roto - torsional dynamics of dna have been considered by other authors ; the torsional degrees of freedom are relevant in connection with the opening of the dna double helix taking place to allow rna - polymerase to access the base sequence to transcript genetic information @xcite .",
    "several models have been proposed in this direction ; references and some detail on these can be found in @xcite .",
    "a particularly simple model ( y model ) was proposed by yakushevich @xcite ; see also @xcite . despite its simplicity",
    ", the y - model succeeds in describing several relevant features of the dna nonlinear ( and linear ) dynamics related to the relevant processes @xcite , and is thus the subject of continuing interest . in recent works it has been shown that all the ( sometimes , very crude ) approximations introduced by in her model  some of these substantially affecting the dispersion relations for the model @xcite  have very little impact on the fully nonlinear dynamics and in particular on solitons shape @xcite .",
    "the y model should in any case be seen as only a first step in a hierarchy of increasingly accurate models @xcite , and has some drawbacks which should be removed by considering more detailed versions of the model ; these are both quantitative and conceptual .",
    "on the quantitative side , we mention the impossibility to fit the observed speed of transversal waves in dna with physical values of the parameters @xcite ; and the fact that soliton speed remains  provided it is smaller than a maximal speed  essentially a free parameter @xcite .    on the conceptual side ,",
    "solitons are possible in these models thanks to the homogeneous character of the chain ; but we know that actual dna is strongly inhomogeneous , as bases are quite different from each other , and homogeneous dna would not carry any information .",
    "the model we consider here describes the dna double chain via two ( rotational ) degrees of freedom per nucleotide , hence it will called a `` composite y model '' , following the nomenclature introduced in @xcite .",
    "these degrees of freedom are related separately to rotation of the sugar - phosphate backbone ( which can be of any magnitude ) on the one hand , and of the nitrogen bases ( which are constrained to a limited range ) on the other hand .",
    "both rotations are in the plane perpendicular to the double helix axis .",
    "this model is a simplified  and somehow a `` skeleton ''  version of the more realistic ( and involved ) model considered in @xcite : in that paper we triggered our model to the actual dna geometry and dynamics , while here we consider a simplified model so to focus on the general abstract mechanism of interaction between topological and non topological degrees of freedom . for the same reason we will restrict to motions which are symmetric under the exchange of the two chains ( as often done also in the analysis of the peyrard - bishop and the bcp models ) .",
    "the model we consider , and more generally the class of composite y models @xcite , represents an improvement with respect to the standard y model both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view .    on the quantitative , phenomenological , side",
    ", we have a much higher flexibility of the chain described by the model and dramatic consequences on the model ability to provide realistic physical quantities .",
    "e.g. , with the composite y model considered in @xcite , one obtains the experimentally observed transverse phonon speed using interaction energies of the physical order of magnitude , and a selection of solitons speed .    on the qualitative side , which is maybe even more interesting ( and more widely applicable than merely dna ) ,",
    "the composite y model is remarkable in that the uniform and the non - uniform parts of the dna molecule ( backbone and bases respectively ) are described by separate degrees of freedom .",
    "it happens that , as a consequence of the geometry of the dna molecule , the degree of freedom describing the backbone supports topological  hence strongly stable  solitons , while the one describing the motion of bases performs quite limited excursion due to steric hindrances ; as mentioned above , this is taken into account in our model .",
    "it is thus quite conceivable that introducing in the model a non - uniformity which affects only the latter degree of freedom , a perturbation approach would allow to obtain solutions in terms of perturbed solutions for the uniform model ; see sections [ slaved ] and [ discussion ] below .",
    "the perturbative approach is also attractive in that by a suitable limiting procedure , see section [ perturbative ] below ( and @xcite ) , the composite y model reduces to a standard y model , for which exact solutions can be obtained .",
    "thus , a perturbative description for the uniform composite y model can be obtained by perturbing the system near the standard y solutions .",
    "a drawback of general composite y models is that the equations describing its dynamics are too complex to be solved analytically , and even the perturbative expansion around the solitonic y solution can be very hard to control @xcite . on the other hand , most of the nice features of the composite model seem to be quite generic , related mostly to doubling of the degrees of freedom and their different topological features , i.e. largely independent of the model details .",
    "numerical investigations for the `` realistic '' composite y model of @xcite showed that introducing a number of simplifications into the model does not affect its main features  confirming the observations for the standard y model @xcite  but surely makes it easier to handle it at the analytical level .",
    "motivated by the previous arguments , we study in this paper a simple  possibly the simpler  composite y model , for which the comparison with the standard y model is immediate .",
    "our main purpose is indeed to focus on the essential features introduced by having two different kinds of degrees of freedom in chain models .",
    "for the sake of concreteness we make reference to  and discuss the consequences for  dna dynamics , but it will be quite clear that most of our discussion is more general .",
    "let us now describe our model .",
    "we define this in abstract terms , but it can be useful  in order to fix ideas  to recall that in applying it to dna the `` first pendulums '' mentioned below and associated to angles @xmath0 represent the nucleosides ( segment of the phosphodiester chain and the attached sugar ring ) , while the `` second pendulums '' associated to angles @xmath1 represent the nitrogen bases .",
    "we consider two chains of double pendulums . on each chain axis there",
    "are equally spaced sites at points of coordinate @xmath2 , with @xmath3 a dimensional constant and @xmath4 .    at each site",
    "@xmath5 on each chain axis , there are identical simple `` first pendulums '' of length @xmath6 and mass @xmath7 , which can rotate with no limitations in the plane orthogonal to the axis .",
    "the rotation angle of the first pendulum on chain @xmath8 at site @xmath9 will be @xmath10 .",
    "attached to the point mass of each `` first pendulum '' there is a simple `` second pendulum '' of length @xmath11 and mass @xmath12 , which can rotate in the same plane as the first pendulums . the angle of rotation of the second pendulum ( with respect to the direction of the first pendulum ) will be @xmath13 .",
    "details are shown pictorially in fig.[dbpend ] .",
    "+    the second pendulum is _ not _ free to swingle through a full circle , but is instead constrained to stay in the range @xmath14 which has the effect of limiting _ de facto _ the excursion of the @xmath1 angles .",
    "the reason for this limitation in the @xmath1 range is our intention to model the dna molecule : in that the bases can not move outside a certain range , as they would otherwise collide with other parts of the molecule ( the phosphodiester chain or the sugar ring ) .    as for the relative position of the two double pendulums chains , this is such that the distance between the suspension points at the same site  and thus with the same @xmath15 coordinate  is @xmath16 .",
    "equivalently , at rest ( i.e. for @xmath17 for all @xmath18 and @xmath5 ) , the distance between masses at the end of second pendulums at the same site on the two chains is @xmath19 .",
    "let us denote , dropping for a moment the index @xmath9 and writing @xmath20 instead of @xmath18 , as @xmath21 the cartesian coordinates  in the plane orthogonal to the double helix axis @xmath15 , with origin in the central point  of the the point mass at the end of the second pendulum .    in the equilibrium position , given by @xmath22",
    ", we have @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 . in general , [ positions ] x^= a r r ( + )  ,  y^= r r ( + )  .",
    "* remark 1 .",
    "* in the standard model , one considers the approximation @xmath26 ; it is known that this approximation has a strong impact on linearized dynamics and dispersion relations @xcite , but for what concerns fully nonlinear dynamics it has been observed that  at least in the framework of the model  the approximation has a very little impact on travelling solitons @xcite . this suggests the possibility of considering the same approximation @xmath27 , hence @xmath28 , here as well .",
    "we will indeed adopt this .",
    "let us now describe the different terms appearing in the lagrangian @xmath29 for the two chains of double pendulums .",

    "the total kinetic energy is of course @xmath36 .",
    "we now pass to consider coupling between different double pendulums ; we will have only nearest - neighbor interactions , which will be of three different types sites away from each other ( with @xmath37 the pitch of the dna helix ) would also play a role @xcite .",
    "physically this interaction is mediated by bernal - fowler filaments @xcite , and it can be described by a potential @xmath38 \\ ; \\ ] ] however , this is unessential in the fully nonlinear , i.e. large amplitude , regime and will hence not be considered here , as we focus on fully nonlinear excitations ( in the small amplitude regime , introducing this term removes a degeneration of the system and is therefore qualitatively relevant ) .",

    "this , albeit entirely natural in terms of the mechanical model ( and thus mentioned here ) , is actually of lesser relevance in modelling dna and will thus be overlooked ; see remark 3 below .",
    "\\(2 ) a stacking coupling between successive pendulums on each chain , described by a potential @xmath40 $ ] .",
    "this is expressed in terms of the @xmath10 and @xmath13 angles , using again ( [ positions ] ) and with @xmath41 , as [ stack ]    rl u_s^(a , i ) = & ( k_s r^2 / 2 ) @xmath42 \\)^2 \\right . \\\\ & \\left . + \\",

    "\\(3 ) a pairing coupling between double pendulums at the same site on opposite chains .",
    "we assume this is due to an interaction between the point particles at the extremal points of the pendulums , described by a potential [ pair ] u_p^(i )  =  f ( _ i ) where @xmath44 is the distance between point masses of the two pendulums at site @xmath9 on the two chains , @xmath45^{1/2 } $ ] .",
    "the total pairing potential will of course be @xmath46 .",
    "recent work of ours in the framework of the simple model @xcite has shown that the shape of travelling topological solitons is very little affected by the detailed shape of the intrapair potential @xcite .",
    "we will thus adopt the simplest choice , i.e. an harmonic potential @xmath47 ; this becomes anharmonic when expressed in terms of the @xmath10 , @xmath13 rotation angles , [ pairlinear ] u_p^(i ) = 4 k_p @xmath48  .",
    "putting all these together , and considering also the constraining potential @xmath49 to be discussed below , the lagrangian describing our system will therefore be [ lagr ]   =  t  -  @xmath50  .",
    "some remarks are in order concerning the potential interactions introduced above .",
    "* remark 2 .",
    "* we have explicitly assumed harmonic potentials for the torsional and stacking coupling between successive elements ( disks and pendulums respectively ) on the same chain .",
    "it should be mentioned , in this context , that recent work by saccomandi and sgura has shown that the choice of a harmonic potential for the interpair interactions ( torsional and stacking couplings ) is not without effect : considering non - harmonic couplings leads to a stronger energy localization @xcite .",
    "we will defer consideration of the effect of anharmonic interpair couplings in our model to later work .",
    "* remark 3 .",
    "* we also note that we have considered here both a torsional coupling originating in the coupling between adjacent first pendulums ( in dna , in the phosphodiester chain ) and a rotational interaction originating in interaction between adjacent second pendulums ( in dna this models the stacking interaction between neighboring bases ) .",
    "the physical origin of these in actual dna molecule is rather diverse .",
    "indeed , the stacking interaction is essentially due to polar interaction between the bases ; these are essentially flat and rigid assemblies of atoms with a strong dipolar momentum , and correspondingly we have ( in physico - chemical notation ) a @xmath51 bond . on the other hand",
    ", the segment of a hypothetical phosphodiester chain without attached bases would be essentially free to rotate with respect to each other ( if not for rather small polar forces ) , the main obstacle to such motion originating in hindrances caused by bases and their occupied volume and polar moments .",
    "it is thus reasonable , as announced above ( and also in view of the considerable complications of equations that would be obtained from the full lagrangian and the fact the two motions are strongly related geometrically ) , to consider the approximation @xmath52 , as we do from now on .",
    "this corresponds to the well known fact that the forces stabilizing the dna double chain are essentially the interbase pairing interaction and the stacking interaction @xcite , i.e. those corresponding to our terms @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "* remark 4 .",
    "* further support to this kind of approximation comes from the results of @xcite , where the model with non vanishing torsional interaction has been investigated in detail . in that case",
    ", the torsional energy is a full order of magnitude lesser then the stacking energy .",
    "moreover , numerical soliton solutions studied in that context showed that the form of the soliton remains almost the same if @xmath55 and all the torsional potential energy is transferred on the stacking term ( see the fig .",
    "8 of @xcite ) .",
    "* remark 5 .",
    "* we stress that , as quite common in dna mechanical models , we are dealing with the dna molecule _ per se _ , i.e. we do not consider interactions of the double chain with the solvent ( the fluid environment it is immersed in ) .",
    "this interaction would lead to exchange of energy with the solvent , with dissipation and random terms appearing in our dynamical equations ( some authors have taken into account interaction with the solvent by introducing correction terms in the intrapair potential @xmath53 @xcite ) .",
    "we hope a model modified in this direction can be studied in the near future .",
    "it should be recalled that the angles @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not on the same footing .",
    "indeed , while @xmath0 is free to take any value , @xmath56 , the angle @xmath1 is constrained to be in the range [ constraint ]  [ - _ 0 , _ 0 ]  . the euler - lagrange equations ( see below ) for the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) should be complemented with such a constraint .",
    "note that ( [ constraint ] ) is an anholonomic constraint , and taking it into account is somehow inconvenient .",
    "it may be convenient , in particular in numerical computations , to remove the constraint and introduce instead a _ constraining potential_. that is , we allow in principles @xmath1 to take any value , but introduce a potential @xmath57 which makes very costly energetically any value of @xmath1 outside the range specified in ( [ constraint ] ) , and has an irrelevant effect on the dynamics when @xmath1 is within this range .",
    "any expression for the potential @xmath58 would be acceptable , provided @xmath58 is essentially flat for @xmath59 and rises sharply as soon as we approach the border  or are outside  of this range .",
    "a convenient form for @xmath58 is [ conpot ] u_c ( )  =  with @xmath60 .",
    "the total constraining potential appearing in the lagrangian will then of course be v_c  =  _ a _",
    "i u_c ( ^(a)_i )  .",
    "the equations of motion for the model are the euler - lagrange equations for the lagrangian ( [ lagr ] ) .",
    "these are obtained with standard algebra , and are relatively involved expressions , which we do not write explicitly .",
    "the equation for the dynamics of variables associated with site @xmath9 involve also values of variables at neighboring sites @xmath61 .",
    "we are mainly interested in solutions which vary slowly in space on the space scale set by the intersite distance @xmath3 .",
    "it is thus convenient to pass to the continuum approximation ; this means promoting the array of values @xmath62 to a field variable @xmath63 such that @xmath64 , and similarly promoting @xmath65 to a field variable @xmath66 such that @xmath67 .",
    "( note we are keeping the dimensional constant @xmath3 , so to have physical units  rather chain units  for @xmath15 . )",
    "moreover , in order to focus on the essential features of the model  and similarly to what is traditionally done in studying the peyrard - bishop and barbi - cocco - peyrard models @xcite  we will just consider symmetric motions ; that is , we assume @xmath68 , @xmath69 which of course entails equality of the field variables as well . we will thus write simply @xmath70 , @xmath71 ; and similarly for derivatives .",
    "* remark 6 .",
    "* it should be stressed that if we restrict to symmetric solutions in discussing the standard y model , then only one type of kink solitons can exist , i.e. those connecting equilibrium positions at @xmath72 with a total phase shift of @xmath73 ; higher solitons , even if with symmetric topological numbers , would require a deviation from a fully symmetric dynamics .    in this",
    "setting , we write @xmath74 and @xmath75 for variables at site @xmath9 ; and for neighboring sites we have , expanding in taylor series up to order two in @xmath3 , _ i 1 = _ z + ( 1/2 ) ^2 _ zz  ,   _ i 1 = _ z + ( 1/2 ) ^2 _ zz  .    with these ,",
    "the euler - lagrange equations issued from ( [ lagr ] ) are rewritten as second order pdes for @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in order to simplify the writing ,",
    "we introduce the notations ( )  : = r^2 + r r ( )  ;  ( )  : =  r^2 + r^2 + 2 r r ( )  .",

    "we have shown that the equations can be tackled in terms of a perturbation expansion around the soliton , and computed the behavior of the new ( non - topological ) field at first order .",
