    "neutrino oscillations @xcite is one of the most intriguing phenomena of today high - energy physics and one of the most promising ways to explore the physics beyond the standard model . at present",
    "there are three experimental indications in favor of neutrino oscillations that have been obtained in solar neutrino experiments ( homestake @xcite , kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite , sage @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite ) , in atmospheric neutrino experiments ( kamiokande @xcite , imb @xcite , super - kamiokande @xcite , soudan-2 @xcite and macro @xcite ) ) and in the accelerator lsnd experiment @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay ( @xmath1 ) experiments @xcite and the experiments on the direct measurement of neutrino masses @xcite did not obtain any positive result so far ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the connection between the properties of neutrinos that determine neutrino oscillations ( mass squared differences and neutrino mixing ) and neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay have been discussed in many papers . in this paper",
    "we discuss some implications of the latest results of neutrino oscillation experiments for neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay and we show that under reasonable assumptions there is a lower bound for the effective majorana neutrino mass measured in @xmath1 decay experiments .    if massive neutrinos are majorana particles , the matrix element of @xmath1 decay is proportional to the effective majorana mass @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the mixing matrix that connects the flavor neutrino fields @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) to the fields @xmath6 of neutrinos with masses @xmath7 through the relation @xmath8 the present experimental upper limit for @xmath9 , @xmath10 has been obtained from the measurement of the half - life of @xmath11ge in the heidelberg ",
    "moscow experiment ( @xmath12 at 90% cl ) @xcite .",
    "the range of the upper bound ( [ exp - bb ] ) is due to the uncertainty of the theoretical calculation of the nuclear matrix element and has been obtained from the results of different calculations using the quasiparticle random phase approximation ( qrpa ) @xcite . in particular , the recent qrpa calculation in @xcite yields the rather stringent upper bound @xmath13 . on the other hand , the shell model calculation in @xcite yields the loser bound @xmath14 .",
    "however , the calculation of the nuclear matrix element for the neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay of @xmath11ge presented in @xcite has been truncated before reaching convergence and the full calculation is expected to yield a more stringent upper bound for @xmath15 .",
    "therefore , in the following we will consider the range in eq .",
    "( [ exp - bb ] ) as a reliable estimate of the uncertainty of the experimental upper bound for the effective majorana mass @xmath16 .",
    "the next generation of @xmath1 decay experiments is expected to be sensitive to values of @xmath9 in the range @xmath17 ev @xcite .",
    "values of @xmath9 as small as about @xmath18 ev may be reachable not far in the future @xcite .    after the measurement in the super - kamiokande experiment of an up - down asymmetry of @xmath19-like events induced by atmospheric muon neutrinos , the experimental evidence in favor of oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos is widely considered to be beyond reasonable doubts ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "there are also convincing arguments in favor of a neutrino oscillation explanation of the solar neutrino problem ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , in this paper we will consider first , in section [ three neutrinos ] , the implications for @xmath1 decay in the scheme with mixing of three neutrinos and a mass hierarchy that can accommodate the results of atmospheric and solar neutrino experiments . in section",
    "[ four neutrinos ] we consider the schemes with four massive neutrinos that can accommodate all neutrino oscillation data , including the lsnd results in favor of @xmath20 and @xmath21 oscillations that wait for independent confirmations by other experiments @xcite .",

    "this hierarchy is the one with three neutrinos and a mass hierarchy , @xmath25 in the framework of the hierarchical spectrum ( [ mass - hierarchy ] ) the mass - squared differences relevant for the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos are @xmath26 the mass hierarchy ( [ mass - hierarchy ] ) is predicted by the see - saw mechanism @xcite , which predicts also that the tree light massive neutrinos are majorana particles . in this case",
    "neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay is possible .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the results of neutrino oscillation experiments imply a rather stringent upper bound ( about @xmath27 ) for the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay in the scheme with mixing of three neutrinos and a mass hierarchy . in principle",
    "the effective majorana mass ( [ effective ] ) can be vanishingly small because of cancellations among the contributions of the different mass eigenstates",
    ". however , since the neutrino masses and the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix are independent quantities , if there is a hierarchy of neutrino masses such a cancellation would be the result of an unlikely fine - tuning , unless some unknown symmetry is at work .",
    "here we consider the possibility that no such symmetry exist and _ no unlikely fine - tuning operates to suppress the effective majorana mass _ ( [ effective ] ) . in this case",
    "we have @xmath28 let us define the absolute value of the contribution of the neutrino mass @xmath7 to @xmath9 as @xmath29 in the following we will estimate the value of @xmath9 using the largest @xmath30 obtained from the results of neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the results of the chooz experiment @xcite and the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino data @xcite imply that @xmath31 is small ( @xmath32 ) and there is an upper limit of about @xmath33 ev for the contribution @xmath34 to the effective majorana mass in @xmath1 decay @xcite .",

    "therefore , we see that the experimental evidences in favor of neutrino oscillations indicate that neutrinos may be majorana particles and neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay is a concrete possibility .    it has been shown @xcite that there are only two schemes with four - neutrino mixing that can accommodate the results of all neutrino oscillation experiments : @xmath80 these two spectra are characterized by the presence of two pairs of close masses separated by a gap of about 1 ev which provides the mass - squared difference @xmath81 responsible of the oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment . in the scheme a @xmath82 and @xmath83 , whereas in scheme b @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",

    "<S> considering the scheme with mixing of three neutrinos and a mass hierarchy that can accommodate the results of solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments , it is shown that the results of solar neutrino experiments imply a lower bound for the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay , under the natural assumptions that massive neutrinos are majorana particles and there are no unlikely fine - tuned cancellations among the contributions of the different neutrino masses . considering the four - neutrino schemes that can accommodate also the results of the lsnd experiment , it is shown that only one of them is compatible with the results of neutrinoless double-@xmath0 decay experiments and with the measurement of the abundances of primordial elements produced in big - bang nucleosynthesis . </S>",
