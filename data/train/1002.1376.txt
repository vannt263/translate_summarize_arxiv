    "both scalar fields and perfect fluids are pervasive in our present models for the evolution of the universe since its birth until the current epoch of accelerated expansion . both ( early time ) inflation and the present dark energy epoch",
    "are commonly supposed to be supported by scalar fields .",
    "the intermediate epochs in the evolution of the universe usually consist of a radiation - dominated era followed by a matter - dominated era .",
    "these can be well described by barotropic perfect fluids with equations of state @xmath0 equal to one third and zero , respectively .",
    "a barotropic perfect fluid can be defined as a perfect fluid where the pressure is a function of the energy density only ( the same function for the background and the perturbations ) .",
    "because of the importance of scalar fields and perfect fluids in present - day cosmological models , the theory of cosmological perturbations in these models has been intensively studied and is well developed . for instance , cosmological perturbations for perfect fluids at linear order have been studied in @xcite , at second order in @xcite and more recently at third order @xcite .",
    "some fully nonlinear results have also been obtained ; see for example @xcite .",
    "similarly , linear cosmological perturbations in canonical scalar field systems have been studied in @xcite , and in @xcite at second and third order in perturbations .",
    "more recently , cosmological perturbations in noncanonical scalar field models have attracted much attention .",
    "the reason for such interest is that it was realized that inflationary models in string theory @xcite naturally contain scalar fields with nonstandard kinetic terms and these models can also give rise to large non - gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbation .",
    "@xcite studied linear perturbations . for second - order perturbations ,",
    "see for instance @xcite and for third - order , see @xcite .",
    "perturbations up to third order of inflationary models with multiple noncanonical scalar fields have also been studied ; see for instance @xcite .",
    "because of their importance in cosmology , it is natural to ask when , if in any case , can we describe a scalar field by a perfect fluid and vice versa . if there are some models where this equivalence is realized one may be able to use the known results of perturbation theory mentioned above to study models of perfect fluids or scalar fields where the calculation in one side of the duality has not been done .",
    "a recent explicit example of such a case can be found in @xcite .",
    "when both results of perturbation theory for scalar fields and perfect fluids exist , in the dual models , one can use the equivalence as an extra consistency check for the calculations .    in this brief report , we will discuss the equivalence of a barotropic perfect fluid with a so - called k - essence / k - inflation scalar field @xcite .    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section , we will introduce a general class of k - essence / k - inflation models under study . we will also present the background equations of motion . in section [ sec : main ] , we will briefly discuss linear perturbations ; we shall _ obtain _ and _ solve _ the second - order partial differential equation that gives us the class of scalar field models that is dual to a barotropic perfect fluid , under the assumption of an irrotational fluid flow .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] is devoted to conclusion .",
    "we consider a fairly general class of single scalar field models described by the action @xmath1 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the scalar field , @xmath3 is the planck mass that will be set to unity hereafter , @xmath4 is the ricci scalar , and @xmath5 is the scalar field kinetic term .",
    "@xmath6 is the metric tensor .",
    "we label the scalar field lagrangian by @xmath7 and we assume that it is a well behaved function of two variables , the scalar field @xmath2 and its kinetic term @xmath8 .",
    "this general field lagrangian includes as particular cases the common canonical scalar field model , dirac - born - infeld inflation @xcite and k - inflation / k - essence @xcite .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is defined as @xmath9 which gives @xmath10 if @xmath11 is timelike ( i.e. @xmath12 ) , then this is of the perfect fluid form @xmath13 with the pressure @xmath7 and the energy density @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the derivative of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "the four - velocity is subject to the constraint @xmath16 and reads @xmath17 the scalar field equation of motion is @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes a covariant derivative .",
    "we are interested in flat , homogeneous , and isotropic friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker background universes described by the line element @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the scale factor .",
    "the friedmann equation and the continuity equation read @xmath22 where the hubble rate is @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the background energy density of the scalar field given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the derivative of @xmath7 with respect to @xmath8 evaluated at the background value @xmath27 .",
    "in this section , we will first discuss linear perturbations and the condition for the equivalence between a scalar field model and a barotropic fluid .",
    "then we will obtain and solve the second - order partial differential equation that determines the class of scalar field models dual to an irrotational barotropic perfect fluid . at the end of the section",
    ", we will briefly discuss the behavior of the nonadiabatic pressure perturbation .    on the comoving time - slices ,",
    "the scalar field fluctuations vanish , @xmath28 , and the three - dimensional spatial metric @xmath29 is perturbed as @xmath30\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where tensor perturbations have been neglected and @xmath31 denotes the curvature perturbation on comoving slices . @xmath32 and @xmath33 can be put to zero by an appropriate choice of spatial coordinates , where @xmath33 denotes an intrinsic vector perturbation .",
    "the linear equation of motion for @xmath31 is @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the speed of propagation of scalar perturbations (  speed of sound \" ) given by  @xcite @xmath37    in the case of a barotropic perfect fluid , scalar perturbations propagate with speed @xmath38 given by @xmath39 which is often called the adiabatic sound speed . the comoving slicing condition for a fluid is @xmath40 , and the curvature perturbation on comoving slices @xmath31 follows eq .",
    "( [ calrceq ] ) with @xmath41 replaced by @xmath42 .    in general these two speeds",
    "are different @xcite .",
    "but one can consider under which conditions they are the same . requiring @xmath43 , and after using @xmath44 and the background equations of motion , one finds the following equation : @xmath45 this equation can be integrated once to give @xmath46 where @xmath47 is an arbitrary function of @xmath2 .",
    "using the method of characteristics , one can further integrate eq .",
    "( [ intonce ] ) to find ) and the solution ( [ solution ] ) for a rather different problem ; the necessary condition for the existence of exact stationary field configurations .",
    "the nontrivial fact that the condition for the existence of stationary configurations perfectly coincides with the requirement of exact equivalence between a scalar theory and a barotropic perfect fluid may deserve further study . ] @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are arbitrary functions .",
    "for this lagrangian , the adiabatic sound speed , which is equal to the speed of sound , is given by @xmath51 where we define @xmath52 as @xmath53 .",
    "this is the most general class of scalar field models @xmath54 that is exactly equivalent to a barotropic perfect fluid , under the assumption of the velocity being described by a single scalar potential , i.e. the fluid flow is irrotational .",
    "figure  [ diagram ] is a graphical description of this result .",
    "the fact that any solution to the einstein equations in the presence of a barotropic perfect fluid can be interpreted as a solution in the presence of a purely kinetic k - essence scalar field is known in the literature @xcite ( see also for example @xcite ) . here",
    "we show that all the other k - essence models that depend on the values of the scalar field and satisfy eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) are also equivalent to a barotropic perfect fluid .",
    "the lagrangian of these other models has to be of the form ( [ solution ] ) ) and the purely kinetic k - essence models possess the same equation of state parameter and speed of sound and thus are also equivalent to barotropic perfect fluids .",
    "here we show that these are the only scalar field models that are equivalent because only these models satisfy the necessary and sufficient condition ( [ mastereq ] ) . ] .    a standard canonic scalar field , i.e. @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the potential , is not included in this class of models .",
    "the speed of sound is @xmath57 and the adiabatic sound speed is @xmath58 all purely kinetic k - essence models , i.e. the field s lagrangian is of the form @xmath59 , are included in this class of models .",
    "these fields have been used to drive inflation @xcite and to be the dark energy @xcite .    if @xmath60 , where @xmath53 , then eq .  ( [ energy ] ) can be written as @xmath61 and one has that the energy density @xmath62 is a function of @xmath52 only .",
    "so if @xmath63 is invertible one can in principle find the equation of state @xmath64 . assuming @xmath65 so that @xmath66 , the previous equation can also be put in the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is an integration constant .    for a given invertible equation of state one",
    "has @xmath69 , and if @xmath60 , eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) can be written as @xmath70 and integrated to give @xmath71 from where one finds the lagrangian given an equation of state @xmath72 .",
    "it may be worth mentioning the expression for the conserved ( `` baryon '' ) number density @xmath73 . for @xmath74 and @xmath75 , it is determined by @xmath76 this may be readily integrated to give @xmath77 where @xmath78 is a constant of integration , which would be a function of entropy for a perfect fluid .    for the scalar field lagrangian ( [ solution ] ) , because both the pressure and the energy density are functions of one variable only , i.e. @xmath52 , it can be shown that the nonadiabatic pressure perturbation defined for instance in @xcite vanishes exactly to all orders in perturbations and on all scales .",
    "this is not surprising because all models of the form ( [ solution ] ) are dual to barotropic ( i.e. adiabatic ) perfect fluids where the nonadiabatic pressure perturbation vanishes by definition . in other words ,",
    "the equivalence between the dual models is independent of the background because the derived second - order differential equation  ( [ mastereq ] ) is independent of the background but dependent only on the form of @xmath7 as a function of @xmath8 and @xmath2 , despite the fact that it was derived from the condition for the equivalence in linear perturbation theory .",
    "in this brief report , we have studied under which conditions a general k - essence scalar field is equivalent to an irrotational barotropic perfect fluid .",
    "we have found that the condition can be written as a second - order partial differential equation for the lagrangian of the field , eq .",
    "( [ mastereq ] ) , that simply states that the sound speed @xmath36 at which scalar perturbations propagate has to be equal to the adiabatic sound speed @xmath38 .",
    "we have found the most general solution for that equation , eq .",
    "( [ solution ] ) .",
    "the lagrangian of the solutions we found depends explicitly on both the kinetic term @xmath8 and the scalar field value @xmath2 .",
    "however , this dependence is of the restrictive form @xmath79 , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are arbitrary functions . after a suitable field redefinition , @xmath80 where @xmath81",
    ", the lagrangian can be cast in the form of a purely kinetic k - essence model .",
    "we note , however , that in reality there may exist plural fields or fluids that interact with each other , which may lead to small violations of the perfect fluid / adiabaticity condition . in such a case",
    ", the field redefinition may or may not be useful depending on the form of interactions as well as on the situation of interest .    one can show that , for the lagrangian ( [ solution ] ) , the nonadiabatic pressure perturbation vanishes exactly to all others in perturbations and on all scales .",
    "this is because both the pressure and the energy density are functions of one variable only .",
    "this result is less surprising if we note that these scalar field models are equivalent to barotropic perfect fluids where the nonadiabatic pressure perturbation vanishes by definition .",
