    "there is widespread hope that the next few years will see the detection of a dark matter particle .",
    "signals of dark matter are searched for obliquely in colliders , directly in underground detectors , and indirectly in cosmic rays .",
    "of these three methods , the last one is _ a priori _ the most challenging because backgrounds from astrophysical processes are difficult to estimate .",
    "nevertheless , indirect detection is a topic of great current interest due to rapid instrumental progress and a constant flow of new and exciting data . during the past year , interest in indirect detection has been further amplified by tantalizing signals from the pamela @xcite , atic @xcite and fermi @xcite experiments , which may or may not be hints of dark matter .",
    "the main search channels for indirect dark matter detection are cosmic ray photons , antiprotons , positrons , and neutrinos .",
    "certain features of neutrinos make them an especially clean detection channel .",
    "neutrinos , like photons , have no electric charge and traverse our galaxy along straight paths . therefore the flux of neutrinos observed at the earth is determined in a straightforward way by the production mechanism and is free of the astrophysical uncertainties which plague the propagation of charged particles .",
    "neutrinos have a further advantage over photons in that astrophysical neutrino backgrounds are far less severe .",
    "detection of a large diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos would thus constitute a smoking gun for dark matter .    in spite of these attractive features ,",
    "neutrinos are seldom singled out as a primary dark matter discovery channel .",
    "neutrinos are weakly interacting and require large , dedicated experiments to detect .",
    "it is much easier to detect charged particles and photons .",
    "typical models of dark matter encountered in the literature predict a cosmic neutrino flux that is smaller than or comparable to the fluxes in other observable channels .",
    "most often , dark matter dominantly annihilates or decays into other standard model particles@xmath5 bosons , for instance , or tau leptons  which produce neutrinos when they subsequently decay .",
    "but then one would expect to first detect that dark matter signal by observing antiprotons from @xmath5 decays or gamma ray photons from @xmath6s in the tau lepton decay chain .",
    "annihilation or decay to primary , hard neutrinos typically appears as only one of several possible final states .",
    "the @xmath7 gauge symmetry of the standard model generically implies that charged particles are produced at comparable rates , and those lead to more accessible signals . for these reasons measurement of the cosmic neutrino flux",
    "sometimes provides useful constraints on dark matter models @xcite , or may serve to break a degeneracy among different models once a signal is detected in another channel , but is not considered the main discovery channel .    in this paper",
    "we argue that one can construct dark matter models which predict a cosmic neutrino flux that is more prominent than the antiproton , positron and gamma ray fluxes .",
    "if such a model is realized in nature , the indirect detection signal could first show up in neutrino telescopes .",
    "the neutrino flux from the galactic center can well be larger than the atmospheric neutrino background , leading to a sharp smoking - gun signature .",
    "the current generation of neutrino telescopes ( icecube and antares ) or the future one ( km3net ) may become the discovery machines .",
    "what kind of set - up is required for dark matter to produce a large neutrino flux ?",
    "it is plausible that the dark matter particle is a perfect singlet under the standard model gauge interactions . if such is the case it can couple to the visible sector via gauge singlet operators which can be constructed out of standard model fields .",
    "the lowest dimensional singlet operators are the higgs mass @xmath8 and the hypercharge field strength @xmath9 , both of mass dimension 2 .",
    "dark matter coupling through the higgs portal or via kinetic mixing with hypercharge has been explored in numerous models . however , if the dark matter particle is a _ fermion _ , then the lowest dimensional standard model operator it can couple to is the dimension 5/2 operator h l_ab h ^a",
    "l ^ b = h ^ + e^-_l - h ^0*_l = g^+ e^-_l- ( v+h+ig ^ 0)_l where @xmath10 gev is the standard model higgs vev .",
    "we refer to this operator as _ the neutrino portal_.    now , suppose that the fermionic dark matter particle @xmath11 is a part of a larger dark sector that is neutral under the standard model gauge group .",
    "assume that the dark sector couples to the standard model via the neutrino portal as [ e.npc ] _ int = o_dark ( ) ( l h ) where @xmath12 is a fermionic gauge singlet operator constructed from the dark matter particle @xmath11 and other fields in the dark sector .",
    "suppose in addition that the dark sector contains _ bosonic _ states that are lighter than @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath11 is the lightest _ fermionic _ state in the dark sector , it is stable within the dark sector .",
    "but in the presence of the coupling eq .",
    "( [ e.npc ] ) the dark matter particle is allowed to decay into fermionic states in the standard model .",
    "the leading dark matter decay channel is then + which leads to a neutrino flux as the dominant signal from dark matter decay ! moreover ,",
    "if there is only one dark sector particle in the final state , the neutrino flux is monochromatic . of course , the coupling in eq .",
    "( [ e.npc ] ) also predicts other , subdominant decay channels : @xmath13 , which imply charged particle fluxes . but",
    "these other decays have one more particle in the final state , and are therefore suppressed by phase space .",
    "the branching ratio for these states with on - shell bosons depends on the multiplicity of dark particles in the final state and the mass of the dark matter particle , and can be made as small as @xmath14 .",
    "cosmic neutrinos then become the most prominent signal of dark matter decay .",
    "we present here a simple model with a strongly coupled dark sector which explicitly realizes this idea .",
    "the model contains an @xmath0 dark gauge group plus a massive majorana fermion in the adjoint representation . with this low energy spectrum",
    "the dark gauge group is asymptotically free for any @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the dark color is confined at low energies and the physical states are dark color singlets : glueballs and glueballinos ( bound states of the adjoint fermion and gluons ) .",
    "the lightest , ground state glueballino ( in the following simply called the glueballino ) is our dark matter candidate .",
    "note that the glueballino , being fermionic , can not decay solely into glueballs , even if it is heavier .",
    "we assume that the dark confinement scale is in the ( sub)-gev ballpark which sets the mass scale for the glueballs , while the glueballino mass is set by the majorana mass of the adjoint fermion of order 1 - 5 tev . in the absence of any coupling between the dark sector and the standard model",
    "the glueballino would be perfectly stable .",
    "decay channels open up once the adjoint fermion is coupled to the standard model via the neutrino portal , that is , via the dimension six coupling @xmath16 \\sigma_{\\mu\\nu } ( l h)$ ] . for @xmath17 gev and @xmath18 ( a one - loop factor ) the dark matter lifetime",
    "is much longer than the age of the universe , while at the same time the decay rate is large enough to yield observable signals .",
    "the leading decay of dark matter is the two - body decay into a dark gluon and a neutrino .",
    "this results in a flux of monochromatic neutrinos from the galactic center which can be detected in the current generation of neutrino telescopes , antares and icecube .",
    "other indirect detection signals are suppressed , so that neutrino telescopes are singled out as the most sensitive probes of our scenario .",
    "moreover , the cross - section of our dark matter particle on nuclei is small , giving null predictions for direct detection experiments .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce our example model of the dark sector and discuss the spectrum after the dark gauge group confines . in section 3 we study the thermal relic abundance , including the sommerfeld effect and late annihilation of glueballinos . depending on assumptions about modeling nonperturbative contributions to the annihilation cross - section , the correct relic abundance may be obtained for dark matter masses in the range 1 - 10 tev provided the strong coupling scale is sufficiently small . besides the sizable theoretical uncertainties due to modeling the strongly coupled effects at energies below the confinement scale , the precise value of the mass is also sensitive to the number of degrees of freedom in the hidden sector  the larger the number of colors , the smaller the required dark matter mass . in section 4",
    "we compute the decay width and the branching ratio for dark matter decays due to the coupling via the neutrino portal .",
    "we demonstrate that for the dark matter mass close to a tev the neutrino decay channel is by far dominant , while other decay channels have branching ratios at a few percent level . for heavier dark matter ,",
    "close to 5 tev , the decay rate into charged standard model particles becomes comparable to the decay rate into neutrinos . in section 5",
    "we make a slight detour to explain why the glueballs in the dark sector can not be stable .",
    "we enumerate various options for their decay into the standard model final states and indicate options for model building .",
    "glueball decays may do lead to additional indirect detection signals which however are highly model dependent .",
    "for this reason we choose to focus on the more robust signals from the glueballino decays via the neutrino portal .    in the later sections of the paper we turn to discussing observational consequences of the general scenario where structure in the dark sector enables dark matter decay to yield a monochromatic neutrino flux as its primary signal . in section 6",
    "we determine the parameter space consistent with indirect detection experiments .",
    "the super - kamiokande bounds on the neutrino flux from the galactic center set a lower bound on the dark matter lifetime , or equivalently on the scale @xmath19 which suppresses the coupling through the neutrino portal .",
    "that scale turns out to lie in the @xmath20 gev ballpark ",
    "the typical scale for lepton violating interactions .",
    "we also study the current bounds from the antiproton , positron and gamma ray fluxes .",
    "we conclude that even for the maximum lifetime allowed by super - kamiokande the indirect bounds from other detection channels are less constraining in a large portion of parameter space .",
    "one exception are the bounds from antiprotons , which are produced in subdominant dark matter decay channels with standard model gauge and higgs boson in the intermediate state .",
    "these bounds are comparable to those from super - kamiokande for dark matter masses around 1 tev , and when the dark matter mass is close to 5 tev ( and thus the branching ratio for decays into charged particles becomes large ) the antiproton flux measured by the pamela experiment implies a more severe constraint on the dark matter decay rate than the super - kamiokande bounds .",
    "however , one should note that uncertainties involved in the propagation of antiprotons in our galaxy are very large , and by changing the parameters of the propagation model one can reduce the antiproton flux by a factor of five , thus obliterating the antiproton bounds . we therefore continue to refer to the super - kamiokande bounds , which are comparatively free of astrophysical uncertainties . in section 7",
    "we study the discovery prospects in antares and icecube .",
    "we compute the rate of signal events in both detectors induced by the predicted neutrino flux from the galactic center , and compare it to the background rate from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "we conclude that neutrino telescopes have a great potential to probe this scenario , and their sensitivity will exceed that of super - kamiokande by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude .",
    "in this section we construct an example of a dark matter model which leads to an enhanced neutrino signal .",
    "the model falls into the _ hidden valley _",
    "class @xcite , where the hidden sector contains fairly light states ( here gev scale ) interacting very weakly with the standard model through higher dimensional operators .",
    "the hidden sector here consists of a @xmath0 gauge group together with a fermion in the adjoint representation , @xmath21 .",
    "incidentally , this is also the field content of pure @xmath221 super - yang - mills theory , but we do not consider supersymmetry here : the fermion has a tev scale mass @xmath23 and the interactions of the hidden sector with the standard model are not supersymmetric .",
    "the dark gauge group is asymptotically free for any @xmath15 so that the theory confines at low energies .",
    "we assume that the confinement scale is in the gev ballpark , well below the adjoint fermion mass .",
    "the low - energy theory below a tev contains only the dark gluons , and after confinement the low - energy degrees of freedom are stable glueballs .",
    "the spectrum of a pure yang - mills theory has been studied on the lattice for the case @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "these studies indicate there are 12 stable glueballs in a pure @xmath25 theory , labeled by their @xmath26 quantum numbers .",
    "the masses of the glueballs are set by the strong coupling scale @xmath27 .",
    "the lightest glueball is the @xmath28 , with @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the `` force radius '' related to the confinement scale @xmath31 ( defined by the running coupling in the ms - bar scheme ) by @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "thus , the lightest glueball mass m_0++ 7 is appreciably larger than the confinement scale .",
    "the spectrum of glueball states for @xmath24 is shown in figure  [ fig : glue ] . while lattice results for the glueball spectrum are only available for @xmath33 , the masses of glueballs do not vary appreciably with @xmath15 in the large-@xmath15 limit .",
    "the spectrum of the @xmath33 theory is thus a useful benchmark for more general cases .",
    "gauge theory , after @xcite .",
    "masses are shown in units of the lightest glueball mass @xmath34 .",
    "[ fig : glue],width=377 ]    in addition to glueballs , the spectrum of the dark sector contains color singlet bound states of the adjoint fermion and gluons . borrowing from supersymmetric jargon we refer to the lightest of such states as _ the glueballino_.",
    "the glueballino is stable under decays within the dark sector , and is our dark matter candidate .",
    "in the early universe at @xmath35 tev the adjoint fermions and the dark gluons were in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we assume that at even larger temperatures the dark sector was in thermal equilibrium with the standard model , but near a tev the two sectors are already decoupled . below a tev",
    "the adjoint fermions become non - relativistic and drop out of thermal equilibrium , leaving a relic abundance that is in principle determined by the fermion mass , the dark gauge coupling and the number of dark colors . the freezeout calculation of @xmath11 abundance",
    "is closely analogous to the well - studied problem of gluino dark matter @xcite . in the following we estimate the range of fermion masses that are compatible with the observed dark matter abundance .",
    "we first compute the relic abundance ignoring non - perturbative effects , in which case the standard textbook procedure applies . the perturbative matrix element for the annihilation @xmath36",
    "can be found in @xcite . at low energies",
    "the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section is given by _",
    "ann v where @xmath37 is the dark coupling at the scale @xmath23 , given in terms of the confinement scale and the number of dark colors by @xmath38 . integrating",
    "the boltzmann equation relates the annihilation cross section to the relic abundance @xmath39 .",
    "the latter can be translated into the dark matter density fraction today by @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 ; wmap fixes @xmath43 to be @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the final result strongly depends on the number of dark colors ( the number of degrees of freedom in the hidden sector ) .",
    "our results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : contour ] .     in the @xmath45@xmath46 plane , for @xmath24 ( red ) , @xmath47 ( green ) , @xmath48 ( cyan ) , @xmath49 ( blue ) .",
    "using the perturbative annihilation cross - section .",
    "[ fig : contour],width=384 ]    nonperturbative contributions to the annihilation cross - section are significant and introduce large uncertainties @xcite .",
    "below we estimate the effects of sommerfeld enhancement and of enhanced annihilation after confinement .",
    "the exchange of dark gluons between the nonrelativistic fermions leads to an enhanced annihilation cross section at low velocity @xcite .",
    "the coulomb interaction of two massive particles takes place on a time scale set by the energy of the scattering particles , @xmath50 .",
    "meanwhile , the time scale for a massive particle to interact with a gluon in the thermal bath , and therefore to randomize its color , is set by its mean free path in the thermal bath .",
    "this can be estimated by @xmath51 . since @xmath52",
    ", the two gluinos will remain in a state of definite total color throughout the interaction , and the sign and strength of their interaction will depend on that particular color state .",
    "we can solve the schrdinger equation in the basis of definite total color , and derive the sommerfeld enhancement in each color representation subspace @xmath53 .",
    "two particles of equal mass moving in a non - abelian coulomb potential have a scattering amplitude enhanced from the plane wave result by the factor [ eq : somm ] e(v_r ) = , where @xmath54 is the _ relative _ velocity of the scattering particles , and @xmath55 depends on the quadratic casimir operators of the single - particle representations @xmath56 and @xmath57 and the total representation @xmath58 , = - ( c_2 ( r ) -c_2 ( r_1)-c_2 ( r_2 ) ) . the annihilation cross - section during freeze - out",
    "is then multiplied by the factor [ eq : prescription ] e_ann(v_r ; \\ { r } ) = _ i ( r_i ) e_i ( v_r ) , which enhances annihilation in attractive channels and exponentially suppresses annihilation in repulsive channels .",
    "as the gluinos are identical particles , we need to ensure that the total wave function is antisymmetric .",
    "annihilation proceeds dominantly in the @xmath59-wave , where the wave function is spatially symmetric , and therefore the net color and spin wave function must be antisymmetric .",
    "thus for @xmath60 , the total enhancement factor @xmath61 is explicitly e ( v_r ) = ( + 9 - 5 ) incorporating the sommerfeld enhancement has an order @xmath62 effect on the mass of the dark matter particle relative to perturbative freezeout , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : somm ] .     as a function of @xmath45 , with ( dashed ) and without ( solid ) sommerfeld enhancement , for @xmath60 .",
    "the solid line indicates @xmath63 .",
    "relic densities are shown for @xmath64 ( red ) , @xmath65 ( green ) , and @xmath66 ( blue ) .",
    "[ fig : somm],width=384 ]    more difficult to estimate are the effects of the increased annihilation cross - sections after confinement , when the @xmath67 have hadronized @xcite .",
    "the heavy fermion @xmath11 is localized within a region of order its de broglie wavelength , @xmath68 , while the total radius of the glueballino is of order @xmath69 .",
    "while the _ total _ interaction cross - section between hadronized adjoints should be geometric , @xmath70 , the annihilation cross - section should be significantly smaller .",
    "estimating the annihilation cross - section is a subtle problem .",
    "the core of the question is whether or not two hadronized @xmath11 s in a state with large angular momentum are kinematically able to radiate away that angular momentum and annihilate .",
    "our hidden sector model differs from qcd in that there are no light fundamental quarks , and hence the mass gap in our hidden sector is larger compared to the strong coupling scale than the mass gap in qcd .",
    "we expect that this suppresses the annihilation cross - section in this model , relative to ( e.g. ) gluino freezeout , as the larger mass gap makes it more difficult to radiate away angular momentum .",
    "we therefore model the late - time annihilation cross - section by taking it to saturate the @xmath59-wave unitarity bound , [ eq : np ] _ np .",
    "we expect that this estimate gives an upper bound on the cross - section , and therefore a lower bound on the relic abundance .",
    "this cross - section yields efficient annihilation of hadronized adjoints , lowering the relic density by roughly an order of magnitude relative to the perturbative result .",
    "it is therefore difficult to obtain the relic abundance @xmath71 without going to corners of parameter space , either large @xmath15 or @xmath72 , or small @xmath31 .    as we will explain in the following section , the most interesting choice of dark matter masses from the point of view of neutrino signals is the range @xmath73@xmath74",
    "this range is consistent with the perturbative computation of the relic abundance .",
    "however , if the non - perturbative effects enhancing the annihilation cross - section are close to our estimate , this mass range requires either sub - gev @xmath31 or a very large ( @xmath75 ) number of dark colors . building a complete model of the dark sector with @xmath31 significantly less than a gev requires some additional structure in the dark sector to be consistent with all cosmological constraints , as we discuss in section  [ sec : poof ] .",
    "the low - energy lagrangian that governs the hidden sector has an accidental @xmath76 symmetry acting as @xmath77 which ensures stability of dark matter .",
    "however , general interaction terms do not have to respect this @xmath76 and may lead to dark matter decay . in this section",
    "we consider the coupling of dark matter to the standard model via the neutrino portal and study possible decay channels .    the operator @xmath78 transforms as a fermion under the lorentz group and as a singlet under both the dark and the standard model gauge groups .",
    "therefore it has the right quantum numbers to couple to the standard model through the neutrino portal .",
    "the interaction takes the form [ eq : portal ] _ int = ^a^ g^a _ h l + . here",
    "@xmath79 is a left - handed weak @xmath7 lepton doublet ; for definiteness let as assume that it is the first generation doublet , @xmath80 , while the couplings to the second and third generations are suppressed by a larger scale . from the point of view of neutrino detection it does not matter which generation has the dominant dominant coupling to dark matter : the neutrino oscillations will make sure that all 3 neutrino flavors are equally populated in the neutrino flux from dark matter decay .    the interaction breaks the accidental @xmath76 @xmath11-parity and allows the dark matter to decay .",
    "it is a dimension six non - renormalizable operator , but it can be easily obtained from a renormalizable uv theory as follows .",
    "let us introduce right - handed neutrinos @xmath81 which have the usual standard model couplings .",
    "in addition , introduce a pair of fundamentals in the hidden sector : a scalar @xmath82 and a ( dirac ) fermion @xmath83 , which have masses equal to @xmath19 .",
    "the lagrangian = _ kin - ^ a ( q^t ^ a ) -c_i q^n_i - q^q |h|^2 -y_ij^n n_i h l_j + contains the most general gauge - invariant renormalizable operators which can be built from the fields in the model . integrating out the heavy @xmath82 , @xmath83 , and @xmath81 at one loop gives the effective interactions _",
    "int = ^ a^ g ^ a _ h l_l + ^a ^a | h| ^ 2 + g ^ a _",
    "g ^ a | h | ^ 2 + .",
    "the coefficients @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 are of order @xmath87 .",
    "the latter two interactions have negligible effect on phenomenology , but the first is the desired coupling of dark matter to the standard model via the neutrino portal . if the scale @xmath19 is of order @xmath88 gev  the typical scale for lepton number violating interactions  then the dark matter lifetime is of order @xmath2 seconds .",
    "such a dark matter particle is stable on cosmological time scales and , at the same time , the decay rate may be large enough to allow for detection of dark matter decay products .",
    "the perturbative vertex given by yields two distinct partonic contributions to dark matter decay : first , the @xmath89 process @xmath90 with a ( hidden ) gluon in the final state , and second , the @xmath91 process @xmath92 , with a ( hidden ) gluon in the initial state .",
    "both partonic processes are part of the full gauge invariant amplitude for the decay of the dark matter particle , but , as we will see , the first process is the dominant contribution .",
    "the main contribution to dark matter decay is then the decay of the heavy adjoint @xmath21 via to two - body and three - body final states with a hidden gluon plus standard model neutrinos , gauge and higgs bosons . the hard gluon @xmath93 from the perturbative decay and the remnants of the brown muck that made up the glueballino go on to hadronize into some number of hidden glueballs .",
    "we first consider the two - body decay with one neutrino and one dark gluon in the final state .",
    "the interaction vertex is obtained from by replacing the higgs field by its vacuum expectation value .",
    "the partial decay width is given by [ eq:2bodyg ] ( g ) _",
    "the cp conjugate decay to anti - neutrinos has the same decay width .",
    "next , consider the three - body decay to gluon , neutrino , and on - shell higgs boson .",
    "the partial width for this process is ( g h ) = ( 3 + 44r - 36 r^ 2 - 12 r^3 + r^4 + 12 r ( 2 + 3 r)r ) , where @xmath94 .",
    "again , the cp conjugate decay to anti - neutrinos occurs with the same rate . in the limit @xmath95 ( g h ) = ( g h | ) _ 3b .",
    "in addition , there are three - body decay modes to ( i ) gluon , electron , and @xmath5 boson ; ( ii ) gluon , neutrino and @xmath96 boson . in the limit",
    "@xmath97 these partial widths satisfy the relation ( g z ) = ( g z | ) = 1 2(g w^+ e^- ) = 1 2(g w^- e^+ ) = _ 3b ignoring gauge and higgs masses , the dark matter lifetime is approximately _",
    ", while the ratio of two- and three - body partial widths is [ eq:2to3 ] _ 3b _",
    "2b 0.01 ( m_)^2 varying @xmath98 in the range 1 - 5 tev , the three - to - two - body ratio varies from 1 percent to 30 percent .",
    "therefore the neutrino flux from dark matter decay dominates over charged particle fluxes , especially when the glueballino is not much heavier than 1 tev .    apart from the process where the adjoint fermion decays into a dark gluon and standard model fields one can also consider the annihillation of the fermion with a valence gluon .",
    "we argue however that this gives a negligible contribution to glueballino decay .",
    "first , it is readily apparent that the rate for the gluino to completely annihilate with its cloud of gluons is vanishingly small . in order for the glueballino to annihilate into the vacuum ,",
    "all of the momentum distributed among the brown muck must be concentrated in a single partonic gluon which then annihilates with the heavy fermion @xmath11 , or in other words , all of the momentum carried by the gluons must be entirely localized within the compton wavelength of the heavy fermion @xmath11 . the probability for this to occur is negligibly small , of order @xmath99 at most .",
    "moreover , the probability for the operator @xmath100 to connect the initial state glueballino to a single glueball at rest is suppressed .",
    "this process can be thought of as an annihilation of the partonic @xmath21 with a coherent sum of soft gluons inside the hadron .",
    "the residual soft gluons after annihilation must carry enough energy to reform into a stable glueball .",
    "as the glueballs have masses of a factor of a several larger than the strong coupling scale , an annihilation of this form is kinematically forbidden unless the @xmath101 has a virtuality likewise several times larger than the strong coupling scale .",
    "computing the cross - section for @xmath102 and taking @xmath103 , we can estimate ~ .",
    "strictly , as the gluon participating in the interaction is soft we need to integrate this expression over the field configuration of the glueballino .",
    "to obtain an estimate for the annihilation rate we simply estimate the result of this integral as @xmath31 .",
    "this yields an estimate for the rate ~ : this is suppressed relative to the two - body decay rate by a factor of @xmath104 .",
    "however the rate for the full process should be suppressed even further , as the gluino must have emitted a hard gluon before participating in the annihilation in order to be sufficiently off - shell .",
    "this emission suppresses the annihilation process by an additional factor of @xmath37 . in the following",
    ", we will neglect this glueballino decay mode in comparison with the two - and three - body decay modes coming from the decay of the gluino alone .",
    "the hidden sector glueballs can not be stable on cosmological time scales as otherwise they would overclose the universe . in this section",
    "we discuss the thermal relic abundance of glueballs and present several scenarios for their decay .",
    "we will show that there are multiple ways to eliminate the overabundance of glueballs , and will indicate the observable signals associated with each scenario . at the end of the day",
    "it will be clear that the signals and resulting constraints are very model - dependent , in contrast to the sharp predictions from two- and three - body decays via the neutrino portal discussed in section [ s.dmd ] .",
    "therefore , when discussing signals and constraints in the following of this paper we will focus on the more robust signals of the standard model particles coming directly from the neutrino portal operator @xmath105 .",
    "the goal of this section is to point out and characterize a range of options for addressing the glueball problem , and demonstrate that solutions are possible .",
    "readers less interested in model building and more interested in model - independent astrophysical signatures of the neutrino portal are encouraged to jump directly to the next section .",
    "first , we demonstrate why the glueballs must decay . treating hidden sector confinement as adiabatic , the energy and entropy in the thermal gluon bath",
    "are wholly transferred to glueballs after confinement .",
    "if the glueballs do not decay , the present - day energy density in glueballs is then given in terms of the present - day photon temperature @xmath106 by [ eq : gluefoo ] _ glue ( t_0 ) t ^ 3_0 , where @xmath107 is the effective number of relativistic standard model degrees of freedom today , and @xmath108 are the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom in the dark sector and in the standard model when the two sectors were in thermal equilibrium .",
    "avoiding overclosure then requires the strong coupling scale @xmath31 to be smaller than an ev , ( n ^ 2 - 1 ) 1 .",

    "moreover , as most of the mass splittings between glueballs are smaller than @xmath34 , if the @xmath150 is near the threshold to decay to @xmath151 pairs , then kinematics may prevent @xmath151 pairs from being produced in three body decays of heavier glueballs .",
    "a typical final visible state would then be of the form @xmath152 @xmath153 and so on .",
    "a similar story holds for @xmath154 decaying to tau pairs : higher - mass glueballs could yield pion and muon pairs in addition to the tau pairs coming from the decay of the terminal @xmath154 .",
    "glueballs which decay mainly into muon or pion pairs might be obtained with additional model building in the higgs sector .    while it is possible to work out glueball branching fractions for a given mediation model with the help of lattice data for @xmath33 , it is considerably more difficult to arrive at the full spectrum of visible standard model particles produced in a single glueballino decay .",
    "the injection spectrum @xmath155 of visible standard model particles depends on the number and spectra of glueballs initially produced in the glueballino decay . in order to make crisp predictions about indirect detection signals coming from dark matter decay , we therefore need to understand the process of fragmentation in pure yang - mills theory .",
    "unfortunately , this is a situation where neither phenomenological examples from qcd nor data from the lattice can be of help . in the absence of light fundamentals ,",
    "the color tube connecting hard partons can not break .",
    "glueball formation in a pure yang - mills theory occurs heuristically through the crossing of the tube onto itself , a process qualitatively different from fragmentation in qcd .    one simple approach to estimating the relative abundances of different glueball species is a thermal model .",
    "in such a model , the ratio of the multiplicity of glueballs is given by = ( 2j+1)()^3/2 ^-(m_j - m_0)/t where @xmath156 @xmath157 is the mass ( multiplicity ) of a glueball with spin @xmath158 .",
    "the effective temperature @xmath159 can be taken as the center of mass energy of the colored system immediately following the decay of the heavy adjoint fermion , @xmath160 . with @xmath161 ,",
    "the thermal model predicts glueball democracy in the final state : for @xmath162 and @xmath163 , the heaviest of the stable glueballs , the @xmath164 , is produced two - thirds as frequently as the @xmath111 .",
    "unfortunately , the applicability of the thermal model to pure yang - mills theory is unclear .",
    "in particular , excitations of the flux tube ( such as can easily be produced from gluon showering in the final state ) might enhance the production of the higher - spin states above the thermal estimate .",
    "moreover , the thermal model is not well - suited to address a key question for indirect detection : what is the average _ total _ number of glueballs per decay ?",
    "to arrive at an injection spectrum @xmath155 which can be compared to indirect detection data , we need to specify not only a particular model for glueball decay but also a model for fragmentation in the hidden sector .",
    "while it appears possible to build interesting models which have the potential to avoid overproduction of antiprotons , it is clear that not only is there significant freedom in the detailed choice of model , but also that a reasonable model of pure - glue fragmentation is a necessary ingredient in quantifying the predictions of such models for indirect detection experiments .      adding light ( @xmath165 ) fundamental flavors to the hidden sector destabilizes the glueballs to hidden mesons , without destabilizing the adjoint fermion @xmath11 .",
    "as @xmath11 is fermionic , it must decay to an odd number of hidden quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "but such a final state carries non - zero hidden - sector baryon number .",
    "the decay of @xmath11 to light flavor therefore violates baryon number , and is therefore forbidden in the absence of hidden sector baryon number violation .",
    "the meson masses depend on the input light quark masses as well as on the strong coupling scale , and can be tuned independently of the other parameters of the theory .",
    "avoiding overclosure requires that the hidden mesons have sub - ev masses , giving rise to a large but technically natural hierarchy , @xmath166 .",
    "however , the existence of such extremely light mesons leads to concerns that inelastic glueballino scattering @xmath167 may exceed observational bounds on dissipative dark matter interactions . adding such extremely light mesons will also dramatically increase the late - time glueballino annihilation cross - section , likely to a problematic extent .",
    "more attractive model building possibilities are realized by keeping @xmath168 and allowing the hidden sector mesons to decay to the standard model .",
    "this can be realized in multiple ways .",
    "one option is to introduce a @xmath169 coupling to both hidden flavor and visible standard model fermions @xcite .",
    "this allows at least one hidden sector meson to decay to a pair of standard model fermions , with a preference for heavier fermions due to helicity suppression .",
    "the main challenge is then obtaining a short enough lifetime for the shortest - lived hidden sector meson while keeping @xmath170 at the gev scale . for models of the form considered in @xcite , lifetimes of less than a second",
    "can be achieved for @xmath171 , with the mediator mass in the range of a few to tens of tev .",
    "decay to muon pairs can only be realized for a light mediator and @xmath172 close to the @xmath148 threshold .",
    "models with light flavor have one especially nice feature : they allow for more concrete predictions for the visible signals from dark matter decay , as with the addition of light flavor it is possible to adapt models of fragmentation in qcd .",
    "this then allows definite predictions for the spectra and multiplicities of the hidden sector hadrons produced in dark matter decay , which in turn allows detailed comparison to astrophysical data .",
    "while this is appealing , it comes at a cost : the existence of light degrees of freedom in the hidden sector exacerbates the uncertainties in evaluating the annihilation cross - section for glueballinos , and hence in the acceptable mass range for the dark matter .",
    "nonetheless , there are interesting avenues for model building here .",
    "we turn to discussing the constraints on our neutrino portal scenario from various indirect detection experiments . the glueballino decaying via the operator of eq .",

    "bounds on these decay modes therefore constrain the general scenario where structure in the dark sector enables dark matter decaying through the neutrino portal to yield a primary flux of monochromatic neutrinos .",

    "these bounds leave a lot of room for discovery at the current generation of neutrino telescopes .",

    "<S> we consider a model of dark matter whose most prominent signature is a monochromatic flux of tev neutrinos from the galactic center . as an example of a general scenario </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a specific model where the dark matter is a fermion in the adjoint representation of a hidden @xmath0 gauge group that confines at gev energies . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of light fermionic states in the dark sector ensures stability of dark matter on cosmological time scales . </S>",
    "<S> dark matter couples to the standard model via the neutrino portal , that is , the singlet operator @xmath1 constructed from the higgs and lepton doublets , which is the lowest dimensional fermionic singlet operator in the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling prompts dark matter decay where the dominant decay channel has one neutrino ( and at least one dark glueball ) in the final state . </S>",
    "<S> other decay channels with charged standard model particles involve more particles in the final state and are therefore suppressed by phase space . in consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the standard indirect detection signals like gamma - ray photons , antiprotons and positrons are suppressed with respect to the neutrino signal . </S>",
    "<S> this coupling via the neutrino portal is most robustly constrained by super - kamiokande , which restricts the dark matter lifetime to be larger than @xmath2 seconds . in the near future </S>",
    "<S> , the scenario will be probed by the new generation of neutrino telescopes . </S>",
    "<S> antares will be sensitive to a dark matter lifetime of order @xmath3 seconds , while icecube / deepcore can probe a lifetime as large as @xmath4 seconds .    </S>",
