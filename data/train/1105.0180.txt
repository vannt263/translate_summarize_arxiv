    "the theoretical description of the high - energy _ elastic _",
    "hadron scattering still constitutes a hard challenge for qcd : perturbative techniques can not be formally applied at this soft ( large distances ) region and nonperturbative approaches are not yet able to predict _ soft scattering states _ from first principles without model assumptions @xcite some of them unjustified . on the other hand , in the phenomenological context",
    ", a wide variety of models can describe the experimental data , but since they are characterized by different physical pictures @xcite a comprehensive , well accepted and unified formalism is still missing .",
    "this situation has to be contrasted with the great expectations from the new experiments at the cern lhc , in special the investigation of the soft diffractive processes in proton - proton ( @xmath1 ) collisions by the totem collaboration @xcite .    at this stage , model - independent analyses , aimed to extract from the experimental data empirical information on",
    "what is theoretically unknown , or on what can not yet be evaluated , may be an important strategy for realistic and necessary developments of the theory in the soft sector .",
    "as first steps in that direction , we have investigated the elastic scattering based only on some general principles , high - energy theorems and model - independent fits to the differential cross section data @xcite . since the impact parameter and the unitarized eikonal representations still constitutes a useful framework for model developments , the aims have been to extract empirical information on the overlap and eikonal functions ( impact parameter and momentum transfer spaces ) .",
    "however , since these analyses demand , as input , experimental information on the differential cross section at intermediate and large values of the momentum transfer , they have been limited to proton - proton scattering in the energy interval 19.4 - 62.5 gev ( as obtained from the cern sps , fermilab and cern isr , nearly forty years ago ) .",
    "therefore , the new data from the lhc on pp collisions at 7 - 14 tev , covering the region up to large momentum transfer @xcite will certainly be crucial for further developments .",
    "one of the main problems with these model - independent analyses is the fact that the phase of the scattering amplitude constitutes a physical observable only in the forward direction ( at zero momentum transfer ) , namely we do not have information on the contributions from the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude beyond the forward direction . as a consequence ,",
    "if we look for empirical analyses , unbiased by any model / phenomenological ideas @xcite different kinds of contributions must be tested and reliable information should not depend , or not strongly depend on the details of these contributions . with this strategy in mind ,",
    "we have already discussed _ two different empirical solutions _ for data reductions both statistically consistent @xcite .",
    "for example , the constrained results obtained in @xcite are in agreement with the standart picture , characterized by the dominance of the imaginary part of the amplitude , except at the dip position , where the imaginary part presents a zero ( change of sign ) and the dip is filled up by the real part . on the other hand , the recent unconstrained results of @xcite indicate the dominance of the real part at intermediate values of the momentum transfer , just above the dip region .    motivated by these different results , both consistent on statistical grounds , we consider here a third possibility with different contributions from those obtained in the above mentioned previous analyses and developed by means of a novel almost model - independent representation for what has been know as martin s real part formula @xcite",
    "this formula connects real and imaginary parts of the elastic scattering amplitude in terms of the transferred momentum in the collision ; it has been derived in the context of high - energy theorems and is embodied by a scaling property .    in this work a representation for this formula , without the full scaling property ,",
    "is used in model - independent analysis of elastic @xmath1 scattering at high energies . by means of an empirical parametrization for",
    "the imaginary part of the amplitude , the use of the martin s formula for the evaluation of the corresponding real part , and fits to @xmath1 differential cross section data ( in the interval 19.4 - 62.5 gev ) , the overlaps ( elastic , inelastic and total ) and eikonal functions are extracted in an almost model - independent way .",
    "the reproduction of all the experimental data is quite good and the two main results are : the extracted inelastic overlap function ( impact parameter space ) is characterized by a peripheral effect ( tail ) above 2 fm and the extracted imaginary part of the eikonal ( opacity function ) in the momentum transfer space presents a zero ( change of sign ) , in the region 6 - 7 gev@xmath2 .",
    "analytical parametrization for these empirical results are introduced and discussed in certain detail .    in the context of our global investigation on the inverse problems in elastic hadron scattering",
    "@xcite the focus here is only in the foundations , applicability and some consequences of the proposed representation . with this aim",
    "we shall only outline references and discussions related to results from previous analyses and phenomenological models . a global critical review , taking into account results that are common to all the analyses",
    "( references @xcite and those presented here ) , as well as detailed discussions on the implications in the phenomenological context will be presented in a forthcoming work .",

    "iii we describe the fit procedures in some detail and display the results of the data reductions . in sect .",

    "general model - independent properties of the scattering amplitude can be obtained from fundamentals principles of local quantum field theory and a set of rigorous theorems @xcite ; in this context , unitarity , analyticity and crossing play a central role .",
    "although rigorous , some results are obtained under specific conditions , which define and limit their range of validity and applicability .",
    "martin s formula has been obtained in this context and therefore it is important to stress the conditions involved . in this section",

    "( 1 ) and for even amplitude ; * the gs , an empirical result verified at the isr energy region ( certainly not asymptotic ) , without restriction in momentum transfer or crossing properties of the amplitude .    that seems a peculiar and/or accidental fact , putting in evidence some intrinsic difficulties associated with the asymptotic concept and the elastic processes in hadronic interactions , in general , as commented by martin and matthiae @xcite .",
    "let us shortly review some further developments concerning the energy and momentum transfer variables associated with the martin s formula .",
    "after the introduction of these scaling in the seventies , the new energy domain reached with subsequents experiments on @xmath24 scattering at the cern s@xmath24s collider ( 546 gev ) and fermilab tevatron ( 1.8 tev ) , have shed light on some aspects involved , as follows .",
    "the gs predicts a constant value for the ratio between the elastic and total cross section , a result in agreement with the experimental data at the isr energy region .",
    "however , at the collider and tevatron energies it has been verified that this ratio increases @xcite , leading to the breakdown of the gs .",
    "on the other hand , in the phenomenological context , henzi and valin have shown that from the isr to collider , the energy evolution of the dip - bump structure of the differential cross section demands not only a geometrical expansion but also blackening and edging effects @xcite . with their bel approach ( blacker , edgier , larger ) , based on dispersive diffraction theory ,",
    "corrections have been introduced in the martin s formula , leading to extensions at higher energies @xcite .",
    "another aspect concerns the interval in momentum transfer in which eq .",
    "( 10 ) is expected or supposed to be valid and that plays a central role in our analysis . in this respect and in the context of the akm",
    "scaling , kundrt and lokajek have developed a detailed numerical analysis @xcite showing that the function @xmath22 in ( 10 ) is real only in a limited interval of the scaling variable @xmath40 , corresponding to the region in momentum transfer 0 @xmath41 0.15 gev@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the use of the martin s formula outside this region has no physical meaning .",
    "this conclusion , however , has been criticized by kawasaki , maehara and yonezawa @xcite and according to these authors , martin s formula can be directly deduced through derivative dispersion relations in the case that gs holds , which is verified , at least , at the isr energy region .",
    "therefore , in this energy domain there would be no limit for the applicability of the martin s formula in terms of the momentum transfer .    despite the above discussion",
    ", a crucial result for our purposes has been introduced by s.m .",
    "roy @xcite in the investigation of unitarity inequalities connecting re @xmath25 and i m @xmath42 .",
    "the main ingredient , suggested by the author and raised by a. martin ( see acknowledgments in @xcite ) , concerns the possibility of a non - scaling only in the imaginary part of the amplitude .",
    "in fact , if re @xmath43 is small compared with i m @xmath43 it seems reasonable to consider the scaling property only in the evaluation of the real part .",
    "the proposal by roy has been to consider eq .",
    "( 10 ) but now with the substitution @xmath44 that is , the scaling is supposed to hold only in the small contribution of the real part .",
    "although under limited formal condition of validity , this proposal can be assumed as a representation for the martin s formula applicable , in principle , to all values of @xmath26 and @xmath45 .",
    "in fact , despite its  hybrid \" character the efficacy of this representation in the phenomenological context has been demonstrated , subsequently , by several authors , for both @xmath1 and @xmath24 scattering and different regions of the momentum transfer and energy with experimental data available @xcite .      as commented in our introduction ,",
    "motivated by two different model - independent results for the contributions from the real and imaginary parts of the amplitude @xcite we consider here a third possibility , based on a representation for the martin s formula .",
    "the point is the roy s proposal , eq . (",
    "11 ) , with a model - independent parametrization for the imaginary part of the amplitude , in the usual form of a sum of gaussian in @xmath46 ( or exponential in @xmath45 ) .",
    "specifically , in eq . ( 11 ) we consider @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 are real free parameters . with this assumption and through eq .",

    "e^{- b_i q^{2}}}\\right\\}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    using as input the experimental values of @xmath52 and @xmath30 in each energy analyzed , we shall consider fits to the differential cross section data through eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 13 ) .",
    "we note that in this representation @xmath26 and @xmath45 are independent variables and the number of free parameters is @xmath53 , due to the constraint @xmath54 however , before considering the above parametrization in our data analysis , some critical comments on its applicability here are in order :    * the analysis by kundrt and lokajek @xcite concerns the scaling variable @xmath55 or @xmath56 . since in the representation ( 13 ) the variables @xmath26 and @xmath45 are independent ( roy s proposal ) , we understand that the restriction to the narrow interval in the momentum transfer , referred to in sect .",
    "ii.b , does not apply . *",
    "as told before , we shall treat only @xmath1 scattering in the energy interval 19.4 gev @xmath57 62.5 gev , a region ( isr ) where the gs is empirically verified @xcite .",
    "therefore , we see no restriction on its use in the evaluation of the real part of the amplitude . *",
    "on the other hand , just the above energy interval brings about some shortcomings related to formal and practical aspects involved . in fact , at the isr region , @xmath1 and @xmath24 scattering are distinct in what concerns the experimental data on @xmath36 , @xmath52 and @xmath30 .",
    "therefore the neglecting of the odd - crossing amplitude ( connected with the asymptotic limit in the martin s derivation ) can not be justified .",
    "now , even if the odd ( - ) contribution could be taken into account , that would demand a simultaneous analysis of @xmath1 and @xmath24 scattering , since @xmath58 however , in that case model - independent fits can not be statistically developed due to the small interval in momentum transfer with data available on @xmath24 scattering @xcite .    therefore , despite the advantages of parametrization ( 13 ) , we understand that it has a limited formal justification in what concerns the evaluation of the real part of the amplitude for @xmath1 scattering in the energy interval of interest here .",
    "that was the reason why we refer to an almost model - independent analysis .",
    "on the other hand , we stress that we do not intend to extract any direct physical implication or interpretation from the specific contribution of the real part of the amplitude . on the contrary ,",
    "as commented in the introductory section , our strategy is to look for global properties from different parametrization and fit results that are not connected with or do not strongly depend on the ( unknown ) contributions from re@xmath43 and im@xmath43 beyond the forward direction . with that in mind and as we shall show in the following sections , parametrization ( 13 )",
    "brings new useful insights in the investigation of the inverse problems in elastic hadron scattering .",
    "our purpose is to use parametrization ( 13 ) to fit differential cross section data through eq .",
    "( 5 ) , using as input the experimental values on @xmath52 and @xmath30 in each set analyzed . in this section ,",
    "we first refer to the data set in which our analysis is based ( sect .",
    "iii.a ) , then we discuss the fit procedures in certain detail ( sect .",
    "iii.b ) and after that we present the fit results and some critical comments ( sect .",
    "iii.c ) .      in the context of our empirical analyses @xcite ,",
    "the evaluation of the uncertainties in the extracted quantities plays a central role . since the fits are based on the differential cross sections , that demands sets with available data covering the largest intervals in momentum transfer , mainly in what concerns the region of high momentum transfer .",
    "as already discussed in some detail @xcite this condition limits the analysis to six sets of @xmath1 elastic scattering data , at @xmath59 = 19.4 gev ( from the fermilab and cern sps ) and @xmath59 = 23.5 , 30.7 , 44.7 , 52.8 and 62.5 gev ( from the cern isr ) .",
    "in addition , we make use of the empirical result that at the isr energy region ( 23.5 - 62.5 gev ) the differential cross section data above @xmath60 4 gev@xmath2 do not depend on the energy @xcite .",
    "this fact allows the inclusion in each set ( isr ) the data at 27.4 gev ( from fermilab ) , covering the large momentum transfer region : 5.5 @xmath61 q@xmath2 @xmath61 14.2 gev@xmath2 ( see @xcite for a quantitative discussion on this respect ) .",
    "the data set have been collected from final published results and a complete list of references , with comments , can be found in @xcite for the data at 19.4 gev and in @xcite for the isr data ( 23.5 - 62.5 gev ) .",
    "the differential cross sections data include the optical point , @xmath62 and the data above the coulomb - nuclear interference region , @xmath63 0.01 gev@xmath2 .",
    "all the available data have been included , without any kind of selection or exclusion of data points . as a test",
    "for goodness of fit we shall consider the @xmath64 per degrees of freedom ( dof ) and since this test is based on the assumption of a gaussian error distribution , only the statistical errors of the experimental data are taken into account ( we do not include systematic errors ) .",
    "we shall return to this point in our comments at the end of sect .",
    "iii.c .",
    "the data reductions have been performed using the cern - minuit code @xcite through successive runs of the migrad minimizer and with the confidence level for the uncertainties in the free parameters fixed at 70 % .",
    "the nonlinearity of the fit demands the start values of the free parameters and looking for a completely unbiased procedure the following methodology has been used .",
    "we have begun the analysis with the differential cross section set corresponding to the largest experimental information available , namely @xmath59 = 52.8 gev ( plus data at 27.4 gev , as explained in sect .",
    "iii.a ) and through the following steps :    * first we have considered only the optical point and the data in the narrow interval 0.01 @xmath65 0.1 gev@xmath2 ( very forward direction ) . in the logarithmic scale ,",
    "the differential cross section data follows a well defined straight line , so that the slope and the intercept can be directly evaluated from the plot and used as start values for the fit with only one exponential term in parametrization ( 13 ) , that is , @xmath66 = 1 .",
    "* once obtained the final fit result , we have enlarged the interval up to @xmath67 = 0.2 gev@xmath2 . due to a sudden change of the slope around 0.13 gev@xmath2 , we have considered two exponential terms ( @xmath66 = 2 ) and used as start values for the parameters in both terms the final values of the previous fit . with this procedure the break of the slope",
    "is quite well described , as well as all the data in the above interval . * next we have considered @xmath67 = 0.5 gev@xmath2 and this case demands @xmath68 . as start values for the third exponential terms",
    "we have tested the final values of each of the two terms in the previous step and selected the best result ( reduced @xmath64 closest to 1 ) . *",
    "the same procedure has been then applied for @xmath67 = 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0 , 4.0 gev@xmath2 and after that , @xmath67 = 14.2 gev@xmath2 .    once obtained the best result at 52.8 gev ,",
    "the final values of the parameters have been used as feed back for the fits at each nearby energy set , namely from 52.8 gev to 62.5 gev , from 52.8 gev to 44.7 gev and then from 44.7 gev to 30.7 , 23.5 and 19.4 gev , successively .    as described above",
    ", we did not impose any kind of constraint in the fit procedure , in special in what concerns the number of parameters or possible dependencies of the parameters with the energy .",
    "the only goal has been to obtain the best fit on statistical grounds .",
    "the final values of the free parameters and statistical information on the fit results for each set analyzed are displayed in table i. with the minuit code , the error - matrix provides the variances and covariances associated with each free parameter .",
    "this information , together with the statistical errors of @xmath52 and @xmath30 , are used in the evaluation of uncertainty regions in the differential cross section and all the extracted quantities , through standard error propagation procedures @xcite .",

    "i , although the values of each parameter in each one of the six sets analyzed are practically of the same order of magnitude , a dependence on the energy can not be inferred .",
    "that is a consequence of our fit procedure , developed without any kind of constraint in the free parameters , as well as the relatively small energy interval investigated ( @xmath84 19 - 60 gev ) .",
    "in fact , the same undefined energy dependence on the free parameters characterizes the results in our previous analyses , with both the constrained @xcite and unconstrained @xcite parametrization . in this respect , the new data on the differential cross section from the lhc ( 7 - 14 tev ) reaching the large momentum transfer region may bring important information for further investigation on possible energy dependencies .",
    "although figure 1 shows that all the experimental data are quite well described , from table i we note that the values of the @xmath83dof for about 200 dof correspond to extremely small confidence intervals . that is a consequence of the fact that we have considered only statistical errors and not the systematic ones",
    "the inclusion of the systematic errors ( for example in quadrature with the statistical ones ) lead to quite good confidence intervals , but we do not think this procedure has statistical meaning , as commented at the end of in sect .",
    "iii.a .    from the plots in figure 2 ,",
    "the contributions to the differential cross section from re @xmath43 and i m @xmath43 are in agreement with the standard or generally expected behavior : dominance of the contribution from i m @xmath43 except at the dip region , which is filled up by the contribution from re @xmath43 . in all sets",
    "i m @xmath43 present a zero ( change of sign ) at the dip position and re @xmath43 two zeros , one at small values of the momentum transfer ( in accordance with a theorem by a. martin for even amplitudes @xcite ) and another one around @xmath45 = 2 gev@xmath2 .",
    "we also note that the large uncertainty regions associated with re @xmath43 , as compared with those from i m @xmath43 , are consequence of the derivative term in parametrization ( 13 ) and the variances / covariances involved . also , from the plots we see that the uncertainty regions from re @xmath43 are larger at the lower energies , which is explained by our fit procedure that started at 52.8 gev , and also the derivative term referred to above .    at last",
    "it should be noted that some characteristics of the fit results here presented and also of those in our previous empirical analysis @xcite are consequences of the data ensemble considered , the choice of the analytical parametrization as sum of exponential in @xmath45 and the use of statistical errors only and not systematic ones . in this respect",
    "three comments are in order as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) all our analyses have been based on the addition of the data at 27.4 gev to the five isr sets ( 23.5 - 62.5 gev ) .",
    "the empirical justification for this procedure has been discussed in detail by vila and menon in @xcite , sect .",
    "specifically , by testing different cutoffs in the momentum transfer , it has been verified that for @xmath85 gev@xmath2 all the above differential cross section data follows a power law in @xmath45 with power @xmath86 @xcite , indicating therefore an energy - independent behavior of the differential cross section in this kinematic region . on the other hand , in the qcd context",
    ", it is expected that this region of large momentum transfer in elastic scattering may be accessed by perturbative techniques . in this respect",
    "the above result favors the triple - gluon exchange picture by donnachie and landshoff @xcite , which predicts @xmath87 , but not the constituent interchange model ( cim ) by lepage and brodsky @xcite , since in this case it is predicted @xmath88 .",
    "this approach also predicts a scaling of the form @xmath89 which has been verified at lower energies @xcite .",
    "there is also indication of agreement with the data at 19.4 gev and 27.4 gev , if a particular power law is assumed for @xmath90 and the systematic uncertainties of @xmath91 present in both sets are neglected @xcite .",
    "this small energy dependence in the interface between fermilab and isr energies corroborates the analysis by vila and menon in the sense to include the data at 27.4 gev only at the isr sets and not at 19.4 gev ( see @xcite , sect .",
    "3.3.2 , for more details ) .",
    "\\(2 ) another aspect in our analyses concerns the assumption of a sum of exponential in @xmath45 , for the _ whole _ range of momentum transfer investigated .",
    "this choice has two foundations as follows .",
    "the first one is strictly empirical since for the differential cross sections in a logarithm scale all the details of the diffraction peak , the dip - bump structure and the large @xmath45 region can be well described by compositions of straight lines , analogous to an exhaustion process ( the empirical character of our analysis impose no limits in the number of free parameters or exponential terms ) .",
    "the second one , to be treated in the next section , concerns the possibility of _ analytical _ translation from the @xmath45-space to the impact parameter space ( fourier transform ) and , more importantly , the _ analytical _ evaluation of the uncertainties in some extracted quantities , through error propagation from the fit parameters . on the other hand ,",
    "as referred to above , the justification for the inclusion of the data at 27.4 gev to the isr sets was based on a power law fit analysis at the large momentum transfer region and not exponential forms . in this respect , it should be noted that as the momentum transfer increases , a replacement of an exponential decrease of the differential cross section to a power one may be related to a transition from soft to hard sectors and in the phenomenological context can be connected with the geometrical structure of the regge trajectories , from linear to non - linear one , respectively , as discussed by fiore",
    "_ et al_. @xcite ( sect",
    "therefore , it might also be important to investigate the possibility to combine exponential and power forms in an unique analytical parametrization . however , we shall limit our analyses to exponential forms for the reasons referred to above , namely they represent a suitable empirical ansatz , ",
    "unbiased by any theoretical prejudice \" , as suggested by fiore _",
    "et al_. @xcite and allows analytical translation to the impact parameter space .",
    "\\(3 ) the last aspect concerns the dataset considered @xcite and the use of statistical errors only and not systematic ones . in this respect it should be noted that another data sets exist , as that compiled and analyzed by cudell , lengyel and martynov @xcite ( where the systematic errors are taken into account ) and available in @xcite .",
    "we think it would also be interesting to develop new data reductions with this data set and our proposed parametrization ; a comparative analysis on all the results could be useful .",
    "in this section we consider some implications of the fit results in what concerns properties of the extracted overlap functions and the imaginary part of the eikonal ( opacity ) in the momentum transfer space .",
    "we first recall the main formulas associated with the impact parameter and eikonal representations ( sect .",
    "iv.a ) and then discuss in some detail the extracted inelastic overlap function ( sect .",
    "iv.b ) and the opacity function in the momentum transfer space ( sect .",
    "iv.c ) .",
    "this subject is treated in detail in @xcite . in what follows we only recall the main formulas of interest here .",
    "the representation of the elastic scattering amplitude in the impact parameter space is named profile function and in case of azimuthal symmetry they are connected by @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the impact parameter , @xmath94 the profile function and @xmath95 is the zero - order bessel function . in the eikonal representation",
    "the profile is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the eikonal function .",
    "the unitarity principle in the impact parameter space is usually expressed in terms of the total , elastic and inelastic overlap functions ,    @xmath98    which , in terms of the profile function reads    @xmath99    where @xmath100 is the inelastic overlap function and it follows that the integrated inelastic cross section is given by @xmath101    in the eikonal representation , from eqs .",
    "( 19 ) and ( 21 ) , @xmath102 since unitarity implies @xmath103 we have @xmath1041 , so that from ( 22 ) @xmath105 can be interpreted as the probability of an inelastic event to take place at given @xmath93 and @xmath26 ; in the black disk limit @xmath106 .    from the above result , the imaginary part of the eikonal is associated with the absorption in the scattering process and for that reason is named _ opacity function _ , which we shall denote @xmath107 in the momentum transfer space it is given by the symmetrical fourier - bessel transform , with notation @xmath108 eikonal models can be classified or distinguished according to different choices for the opacity function in the momentum transfer space , which is expected to be connected with form factors and elementary amplitudes .",
    "due to the importance of the physical interpretations associated with the _ inelastic overlap function _ and the _ opacity function in the momentum transfer space _ , we shall display and discuss these extracted quantities from the fit results .",
    "however , before that , we stress again that the relatively small interval investigated ( @xmath84 19 - 60 gev ) and the unconstrained fit procedure , turn out difficult to infer energy dependencies on these quantities since , in general , the error propagation leads to an overlapping of the uncertainty regions .",
    "we understand that this does not constitute a serious drawback in our analyses because in the phenomenological context what is theoretically unknown , in general , concerns the impact parameter and momentum transfer distributions and not the dependencies on the energy @xcite .",
    "therefore we shall limit the results to typical cases of interest at fixed energy , or those for which there is no overlapping of the uncertainties .",
    "with parametrization ( 13 ) , the profile function can be _ analytically evaluated _ through the inverse ( symmetrical ) transform of eq . ( 18 ) , @xmath109 as well as the overlap functions in eqs .",
    "( 20 ) and ( 21 ) , together with the associated uncertainties through error propagation . for each @xmath93-interval considered for the extracted quantities",
    ", we have generated @xmath110 empirical points in the form of a central value and the corresponding uncertainty , namely @xmath111 .",
    "the results for the extracted overlap functions in all the energies investigated are very similar and are illustrated in fig . 3 in the case of @xmath59 = 52.8 gev ( largest set of experimental data ) .",
    "the figure , in linear scale , shows the uncertainty regions for the extracted total , elastic and inelastic overlap functions .",
    "we note that at @xmath112 , @xmath105 reaches @xmath84 92% of the black disc limit , as expected @xcite .",
    "we now focus on the extracted inelastic overlap function . in order to develop some test on the reliability of the extracted results ,",
    "we have evaluated the integrated inelastic cross section through eq .",
    "( 22 ) , a quantity that was not used as experimental input in the data reductions .",
    "the results for all the sets analyzed are displayed in table ii , showing plenty agreement with the corresponding experimental data .",

    "although , once more , a dependence on the energy can not be extracted in this interval , we can identify the following remarkable features : ( 1 ) each component is concentrated in specific regions of the impact parameter space , with centers at @xmath112 ( @xmath128 ) , around @xmath129 fm ( @xmath130 ) and roughly around @xmath131 fm ( @xmath132 ) ; ( 2 ) @xmath128 dominates the central and intermediate regions and @xmath132 describes the tail effect above @xmath133 2.2 fm ; ( 3 ) the effect of different energies is more evident in @xmath132 then in the others components .    in order to get some quantitative information on the relative contribution of each gaussian component in the integrated cross section , we have evaluated the following partial quantities :    @xmath134    the results with the corresponding sum of the partial contributions in each energy are shown in table iv .",

    "the absence of a pure qcd treatment of the elastic hadron scattering and the lack of a widely accepted phenomenological approach to these processes , have motivated us to investigate the inverse problem , in the context of the impact parameter and eikonal representations . as commented along the paper two of the main problems with these model - independent analyses",

    "the opacity function in the momentum transfer space , extracted through the conditioned expansion method , present a change of sign around 6.5 gev@xmath2 in all sets analyzed .",
    "the empirical points are quite well described by a parametrization consisting of a product of two simple constrained poles ( @xmath176 ) by the function @xmath164 with zero and n=4 .    despite the promising aspects of the above results we stress that only a detailed comparative investigation , based on different empirical parametrization and solutions and aimed to identify results that are common to all the analyses , can bring new reliable insights for model developments and possible connections with qcd .",
