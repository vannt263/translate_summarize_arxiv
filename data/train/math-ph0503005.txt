    "the second construction starts with an arbitrary covering @xmath96 ( with compact quotient ) of dimension @xmath97 and changes the metric conformally , i.e.  @xmath98 , in such a way , that @xmath84 is still periodic and of order @xmath5 close to the boundary of a fundamental domain @xmath19 ; more details can be found in section  [ sec : construye ] . in the case of abelian coverings",
    "these constructions have already been used in  @xcite .",
    "once the construction of the family of decoupling metrics @xmath22 has been done , the strategy to show the existence of spectral gaps goes as follows .",
    "we consider first the dirichlet @xmath99 and neumann @xmath100 eigenvalues @xmath101 of the laplacian on the fundamental domain @xmath95 .",

    "moreover , @xmath590 , hence @xmath1 is not residually finite .",
    "the group @xmath586 is amenable as inductive limit of amenable groups ; therefore , @xmath1 is amenable as semi - direct product of amenable groups ( cf .",
    "* section  4 ) ) .",
    "the equality @xmath591 follows from the fact that @xmath587 is simple .",
    "[ prop : openfinrep ] every finite - dimensional unitary representation @xmath109 of @xmath1 leaves @xmath587 elementwise invariant , i.e.  @xmath592 for all @xmath593 .",
    "let @xmath594 be the class of countable subgroups of @xmath595 , @xmath26 , and @xmath596 the class of finitely generated groups .",
    "note that @xmath597 and that finitely generated linear groups are residually finite ( cf .",
    "example  [ ex : res.fin ]  ( iii ) ) , i.e.  @xmath598 .",
    "arguing as in the proof of lemma  [ lem : res.class ] we obtain from the inclusions @xmath599 that @xmath600 .",
    "now by lemma  [ s0amenable ] the @xmath462-residual of @xmath1 is @xmath587 .",
    "finally , since @xmath1 itself is finitely generated ( i.e.  @xmath601 ) , we have @xmath602 this concludes the proof since @xmath109 is a finite - dimensional unitary representation iff @xmath603 , i.e.  @xmath604 is the intersection of all @xmath605 , where @xmath109 are the finite - dimensional , unitary representations of @xmath1 .    in conclusion , we can not analyse the spectrum of @xmath12 by none of the above methods since @xmath1 is not residually finite ( and therefore neither of type  i ) .",
    "nevertheless , equality holds in  , but we would need infinite - dimensional hilbert spaces @xmath396 in the direct integral decomposition in order to describe the spectrum of the whole covering @xmath10 and not only of the subcovering @xmath606 ( with covering group @xmath607 , cf .  diagram  )",
    ".    coverings with transformation groups as in the present subsection can not be treated with the methods developed in this paper .",
    "it seems though reasonable that even for non - residually finite groups the construction specified in section  [ sec : construye ] still produces at least @xmath29 spectral gaps , @xmath576 . to show this one needs to replace the techniques of section",
    "[ sec : floquet ] that use the min - max principle in order to prove the existence of spectral gaps for these types of covering manifolds .",
    "given a riemannian covering @xmath608 with a residually finite transformation group @xmath1 we constructed a deformed @xmath1-covering @xmath609 such that @xmath610 has @xmath29 spectral gaps , @xmath576 .",
    "intuitively one decouples neighbouring fundamental domains by deforming the metric @xmath611 in such a way that the junctions of the fundamental domains are scaled down ( cf",
    ".  figure  [ fig : per - mfd ] ) .",
    "therefore , our construction may serve as a model of how to use geometry to remove unwanted frequencies or energies in certain situations which may be relevant for technological applications .",
    "for instance , the laplacian on @xmath32 may serve to give an approximate description of the energy operator of a quantum mechanical particle moving along the periodic space @xmath16 .",
    "usually , the energy operator contains additional potential terms coming form the curvature of the embedding in some ambient space , cf .",
    "@xcite , but , nevertheless , @xmath108 is still a good approximation for describing properties of the particle .",
    "a spectral gap in this context is related to the transport properties of the particle in the periodic medium , e.g. , an insulator has a large first spectral gap .",
    "another application are photonic crystals , i.e.  optical materials that allow only certain frequencies to propagate .",
    "usually , one has to consider differential forms in order to describe the propagation of classical electromagnetic waves in a medium .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume that the riemannian density is related to the dielectric constant of the material , one can use the scalar laplacian on a manifold as a simplified model . for more details",
    ", we refer to  @xcite and the references therein",
    ".    a further interesting line of research would be to consider the opposite situation as in the present paper ; that means the use of geometry to prevent the appearance of spectral gaps ( cf .",
    "in fact , these authors proved that @xmath612 for all @xmath165 , i.e , that @xmath613 for all @xmath165 provided @xmath19 is an open subset of @xmath614 or a riemannian symmetric space of non - compact type .",
    "on such a space , we have a priory no information on the existence of gaps .",
    "it would also be interesting to connect the number of gaps with geometric quantities , e.g. , isoperimetric constants or the curvature .",
    "we want to stress that the curvature of @xmath32 is _ not _ bounded as @xmath24 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) in contrast to the degeneration of riemannian metrics under curvature bounds ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) .    in the present paper",
    "we have considered @xmath12 as a prototype of an elliptic operator and have avoided the use of a potential @xmath60 . in this way we isolate the effect of geometry on @xmath615 .",
    "of course , our methods and results may also be extended to more general periodic structures that have a `` reasonable '' neumann laplacian as a lower bound and satisfy the spectral `` localisation '' result in theorem  [ thm : spec.incl ] .",
    "for example , one can also study periodic operators like @xmath616 , operators on quantum wave guides , more general periodic elliptic operators or operators on metric graphs ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite for examples of periodic metric graphs with spectral gaps ) .",
    "finally , we conclude mentioning that we can not apply directly our result to disprove the bethe - sommerfeld conjecture on manifolds , which says that the number of spectral gaps for a periodic operator in dimensions @xmath59 remains _ finite_.",
    "even if we know that the spectrum of the laplacian on @xmath32 converges to the discrete set @xmath617 as @xmath24 , we can not expect a _",
    "control of the spectral convergence on the whole interval @xmath31 since there are topological obstructions ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . note that a uniform convergence would immediately imply that @xmath8 would have an _",
    "infinite _ number of spectral gaps .",
    "nevertheless , we hope that our construction will contribute to the clarification of the status of this conjecture .",
