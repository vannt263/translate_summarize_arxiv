    "characterizing the capacity region of wireless networks is a long standing open problem in information theory .",
    "the exact capacity region is , in fact , not known for even simple networks like a three node relay channel or a four node interference channel . in this paper",
    ", we consider the question of approximately determining the unicast and multicast capacity regions of wireless networks by identifying their scaling in terms of the number @xmath2 of nodes in the network .      in the last decade",
    ", exciting progress has been made towards approximating the capacity region of wireless networks .",
    "we shall mention a small subset of work related to this paper .",
    "we first consider unicast traffic .",
    "the unicast capacity region of a wireless network with @xmath2 nodes is the set of all simultaneously achievable rates between all possible @xmath0 source - destination pairs . since finding",
    "this unicast capacity region of a wireless network exactly seems to be intractable , gupta and kumar proposed a simpler but insightful question in @xcite .",
    "first , instead of asking for the entire @xmath0-dimensional unicast capacity region of a wireless network with @xmath2 nodes , attention was restricted to the scenario where each node is source exactly once and chooses its destination uniformly at random from among all the other nodes .",
    "all these @xmath2 source - destination pairs communicate at the same rate , and the interest is in finding the maximal achievable such rate .",
    "second , instead of insisting on finding this maximal rate exactly , they focused on its asymptotic behavior as the number of nodes @xmath2 grows to infinity .",
    "this setup has indeed turned out to be more amenable to analysis . in @xcite , it was shown that under random placement of nodes in a given region and under certain models of communication motivated by current technology ( called _ protocol channel model _ in the following ) , the per - node rate for random source - destination pairing with uniform traffic can scale at most as @xmath5 and this can be achieved ( within poly - logarithmic factor in @xmath2 ) by a simple scheme based on multi - hop communication .",
    "many works since then have broadened the channel and communication models under which similar results can be proved ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , under the _ gaussian fading channel model _ with a power - loss of @xmath6 for signals sent over a distance of @xmath7 , it was shown in @xcite that in extended wireless networks ( i.e. , @xmath2 nodes are located in a region of area @xmath3 ) the largest uniformly achievable per - node rate under random source - destination pairing scales essentially like @xmath8 .",
    "analyzing such random source - destination pairing with uniform traffic yields information about the @xmath0-dimensional unicast capacity region along one dimension .",
    "hence , the results in @xcite and in @xcite mentioned above provide a complete characterization of the scaling of this one - dimensional slice of the capacity region for the protocol and gaussian fading channel models , respectively .",
    "it is therefore natural to ask if the scaling of the entire @xmath0-dimensional unicast capacity region can be characterized . to this end",
    ", we describe two related approaches taken in recent works .",
    "one approach , taken by madan , shah , and lvque @xcite , builds upon the celebrated works of leighton and rao @xcite and linial , london , and rabinovich @xcite on the approximate characterization of the unicast capacity region of capacitated wireline networks . for such wireline networks ,",
    "the scaling of the unicast capacity region is determined ( within a @xmath9 factor ) by the minimum weighted cut of the network graph .",
    "as shown in @xcite , this naturally extends to wireless networks under the protocol channel model , providing an approximation of the unicast capacity region in this case .",
    "another approach , first introduced by gupta and kumar @xcite , utilizes geometric properties of the wireless network .",
    "specifically , the notion of the _ transport capacity _ of a network , which is the rate - distance product summed over all source - destination pairs , was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that in an extended wireless network with @xmath2 nodes and under the protocol channel model , the transport capacity can scale at most as @xmath3 .",
    "this bound on the transport capacity provides a hyper - plane which has the capacity region and origin on the same side . through a repeated application of this transport capacity bound at different scales",
    "@xcite obtained an implicit characterization of the unicast capacity region under the protocol channel model .",
    "for the gaussian fading channel model , asymptotic upper bounds for the transport capacity were obtained in @xcite , and for more general distance weighted sum rates in @xcite .",
    "so far , we have only considered unicast traffic .",
    "we now turn to multicast traffic .",
    "the multicast capacity region of a wireless network with @xmath2 nodes is the set of all simultaneously achievable rates between all possible @xmath1 source  multicast - group pairs . instead of considering this multicast capacity region directly ,",
    "various authors have analyzed the scaling of restricted traffic patterns under a protocol channel model assumption ( see @xcite , among others ) .",
    "for example , in @xcite , li , tang , and frieder obtained a scaling characterization under a protocol channel model and random node placement for multicast traffic when each node chooses a certain number of its destinations uniformly at random .",
    "independently , in @xcite , shakkottai , liu , and srikant considered a similar setup and also obtained the precise scaling when sources and their multicast destinations are chosen at random .",
    "both of these results are non information - theoretic ( in that they assume a protocol channel model ) .",
    "furthermore , they provide information about the scaling of the @xmath1-dimensional multicast capacity region only along one particular dimension .      despite the long list of results ,",
    "the question of approximately characterizing the unicast capacity region under the gaussian fading channel model remains far from being resolved .",
    "in fact , for gaussian fading channels , the only traffic pattern that is well understood is random source - destination pairing with uniform rate .",
    "this is limiting in several aspects .",
    "first , by choosing for each source a destination at random , most source - destination pairs will be at a distance of the diameter of the network with high probability , i.e. , at distance @xmath10 for an extended network . however , in many wireless networks some degree of locality of source - destination pairs can be expected .",
    "second , all source - destination pairs are assumed to be communicating at uniform rate .",
    "again , in many settings we would expect nodes to be generating traffic at widely varying rates .",
    "third , each node is source exactly once , and destination on average once .",
    "however , in many scenarios the same source node ( e.g. , a server ) might transmit data to many different destination nodes , or the same destination node might request data from many different source nodes .",
    "all these heterogeneities in the traffic demands can result in different scaling behavior of the performance of the wireless network than what is obtained for random source - destination pairing with uniform rate .    as is pointed out in the last section , even less is known about the multicast capacity region under gaussian fading .",
    "in fact , the only available results are for the protocol channel model , and even there only for special traffic patterns resulting from randomly choosing sources and their multicast groups and assuming uniform rate . to the best of our knowledge , no information - theoretic results ( i.e. , assuming gaussian fading channels ) are available even for special traffic patterns .    we address these issues by analyzing the scaling of a broad class of traffic , termed _ balanced traffic _ in the following , in a wireless network of @xmath2 randomly placed nodes under a gaussian fading channel model .",
    "the notion of balanced traffic is a natural generalization of symmetric traffic , in which the data to be transmitted from a node @xmath11 to a node @xmath12 is equal to the amount of data to be transmitted from @xmath12 to @xmath11 .",
    "we analyze the scaling of the set of achievable balanced unicast traffic ( the _ balanced unicast capacity region _ ) and achievable balanced multicast traffic ( the _ balanced multicast capacity region _ ) .",
    "the balanced unicast capacity region provides information about @xmath13 of the @xmath0 dimensions of the unicast capacity region ; the balanced multicast capacity region provides information about @xmath14 of the @xmath15 dimensions of the multicast capacity region .    as a first set of results of this paper , we present an approximate characterization of the balanced unicast and multicast capacity regions .",
    "we show that both regions can be approximated by a polytope with less than @xmath16 faces , each corresponding to a distinct cut ( i.e. , a subset of nodes ) in the wireless network .",
    "this polyhedral characterization provides a succinct approximate description of the balanced unicast and multicast capacity regions even for large values of @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , it shows that only @xmath16 out of @xmath4 possible cuts in the wireless network are asymptotically relevant and reveals the geometric structure of these relevant cuts .",
    "second , we establish the approximate equivalence of the wireless network and a wireline tree graph , in the sense that balanced traffic can be transmitted reliably over the wireless network if and only if approximately the same traffic can be routed over the tree graph .",
    "this equivalence is the key component in the derivation of the approximation result for the balanced unicast and multicast capacity regions and provides insight into the structure of large wireless networks .",
    "third , we propose a novel three - layer communication architecture that achieves ( in the scaling sense ) the entire balanced unicast and multicast capacity regions .",
    "the top layer of this scheme treats the wireless network as the aforementioned tree graph and routes messages between sources and their destinations  dealing with heterogeneous traffic demands .",
    "the middle layer of this scheme provides this tree abstraction to the top layer by appropriately distributing and concentrating traffic over the wireless network  choosing the level of cooperation in the network .",
    "the bottom layer implements this distribution and concentration of messages in the wireless network  dealing with interference and noise .",
    "the approximate optimality of this three - layer architecture implies that a separation based approach , in which routing is performed independently of the physical layer , is order - optimal . in other words , techniques such as network coding",
    "can provide at most a small ( in the scaling sense ) multiplicative gain for transmission of balanced unicast or multicast traffic in wireless networks .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : model ] introduces the network model and notation .",
    "section [ sec : main ] presents our main results .",
    "we illustrate the strength of these results in section [ sec : examples ] by analyzing various example scenarios with heterogeneous unicast and multicast traffic patterns .",
    "section [ sec : schemes ] provides a high level description of the proposed communication schemes .",
    "sections [ sec : aux]-[sec : proof_multicast ] contain proofs .",
    "finally , sections [ sec : discussion ] and [ sec : conclusions ] contain discussions and concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we discuss network and traffic models , and we introduce some notational conventions .",

    "this setting with @xmath2 nodes on a square of area @xmath2 is referred to as an _ extended network_. throughout this paper , we consider this extended network setting .",
    "however , all results carry over for _ dense networks _ , where @xmath2 nodes are placed on a square of unit area ( see section [ sec : dense ] for the details ) .",
    "we use the same channel model as in  @xcite .",
    "namely , the received signal at node @xmath12 and time @xmath21 is @xmath22 { \\triangleq}\\sum_{u\\in v(n)\\setminus\\{v\\}}h_{u , v}[t]x_u[t]+z_v[t]\\ ] ] for all @xmath23 , where the @xmath24\\}_{u , t}$ ] are the signals sent by the nodes in @xmath25 .",

    "phase assumption does not accurately reflect the physical behavior of the wireless channel .",
    "however , in follow - up work @xcite the authors show that under different assumptions on the scatterers this assumption is still justified in the @xmath35 regime even for very large values of @xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that the issue of channel modeling for large networks in the low path - loss regime is somewhat delicate and requires further investigation . ] with uniform distribution on @xmath36 . as a function of @xmath21 ,",
    "we either assume that @xmath34\\}_{t}$ ] is stationary and ergodic , which is called _ fast fading _ in the following , or we assume @xmath34\\}_{t}$ ] is constant , which is called _ slow fading _ in the following . in either case",
    ", we assume full channel state information ( csi ) is available at all nodes , i.e. , each node knows all @xmath37\\}_{u , v}$ ] at time @xmath21 .",
    "this full csi assumption is rather strong , and so it is worth commenting on .",
    "all the converse results presented are proved under the full csi assumption and are hence also valid under more realistic assumptions on the availability of csi .",
    "moreover , it can be shown that for achievability only @xmath38-bit quantized csi is necessary for path - loss exponent @xmath39 $ ] and no csi is necessary for @xmath40 to achieve the same scaling behavior .      a _ unicast traffic matrix _",

    "the edges in the routing layer leading up the tree ( i.e. , towards the root node ) are implemented in the cooperation layer in a similar fashion by further distributing the message over the wireless network . by the time the message reaches the root node of @xmath225 in the routing layer",
    ", the cooperation layer has distributed the message over the entire network and every node in @xmath25 has access to a distinct @xmath243 fraction of the original message .",
    "communication down the tree in the routing layer is implemented in the cooperation layer by concentrating messages over smaller regions in the wireless network . to physically perform this distribution and concentration of messages ,",

    "the routing part is simple .",
    "in fact , between @xmath11 and every @xmath245 there exists a unique path in @xmath225 . consider the union of all those paths .",
    "it is easy to see that this union is a subtree of @xmath225 .",
    "indeed , it is the smallest subtree of @xmath225 that covers @xmath246 .",
    "traffic is optimally routed over @xmath225 from @xmath11 to @xmath52 by sending it along the edges of this subtree .",

    "messages are sent from the source to its destinations by routing them along this subgraph . in other words , @xmath248 is the multicast tree along which the message is sent from @xmath11 to @xmath52 .",
    "the cooperation layer and physical layer operate in the same way as for unicast traffic ( see figure [ fig : layers ] for an example ) .      here",
    "we recall communication schemes for uniform permutation traffic on @xmath20 , i.e. , each node is source and destination exactly once and all these @xmath2 pairs communicate at uniform rate .",
    "as pointed out in sections [ sec : schemes_unicast ] and [ sec : schemes_multicast ] , these communication schemes are used as building blocks in the communication architecture for general unicast and multicast traffic .",
    "the structure of the optimal communication scheme depends drastically on the path - loss exponent @xmath249 . for @xmath39",
    "$ ] ( small path - loss exponent ) , cooperative communication on a global scale is necessary to achieve optimal performance . for @xmath250 ( large path - loss exponent ) , local communication between neighboring nodes is sufficient , and traffic is routed in a multi - hop fashion from the source to the destination .",
    "we will refer to the order - optimal scheme for @xmath39 $ ] as _ hierarchical relaying scheme _ , and to the order optimal scheme for @xmath224 as _ multi - hop scheme_. for a uniform permutation traffic on @xmath25 , hierarchical relaying achieves a per - node rate of @xmath251 ; multi - hop communication achieves a per - node rate of @xmath252 . by choosing the appropriate scheme ( hierarchical relaying for @xmath39 $ ] , multi - hop for @xmath40 )",
    ", we can thus achieve a per - node rate of @xmath253 .",
    "we provide a short description of the hierarchical relaying scheme in the following .",
    "the details can be found in @xcite .",
    "consider @xmath2 nodes placed independently and uniformly at random on @xmath20 .",
    "divide @xmath20 into @xmath254 squarelets of equal size . call a squarelet _ dense _ , if it contains a number of nodes proportional to its area . for",
    "each source - destination pair , choose such a dense squarelet as a _ relay _",
    ", over which it will transmit information ( see figure [ fig : relay ] ) .",
    "consider now one such relay squarelet and the nodes that are transmitting information over it .",
    "if we assume for the moment that the nodes within the relay squarelets could cooperate , then between the source nodes and the relay squarelet we would have a multiple access channel ( mac ) , where each source node has one transmit antenna , and the relay squarelet ( acting as one node ) has many receive antennas . between the relay squarelet and the destination nodes",
    ", we would have a broadcast channel ( bc ) , where each destination node has one receive antenna , and the relay squarelet ( acting again as one node ) has many transmit antennas .",
    "the cooperation gain from using this kind of scheme arises from the use of multiple antennas for this mac and bc .    to actually enable this kind of cooperation at the relay squarelet , local communication within the relay squarelets is necessary .",
    "it can be shown that this local communication problem is actually the same as the original problem , but at a smaller scale .",
    "indeed , we are now considering a square of size @xmath255 with equal number of nodes ( at least order wise ) .",
    "hence we can use the same scheme recursively to solve this subproblem .",
    "we terminate the recursion after @xmath256 iterations , at which point we use simple time - division multiple access ( tdma ) to bootstrap the scheme .",
    "observe that at the final level of the scheme , we have divided @xmath20 into @xmath257 squarelets . a sufficient condition for the scheme to succeed",
    "is that all these squarelets are dense ( i.e. , contain a number of nodes proportional to their area ) .",
    "however much weaker conditions are sufficient as well , see @xcite .    for any permutation traffic , the per - node rate achievable with this scheme is at least @xmath251 for any @xmath31 and under fast fading . under slow",

    "in fact , the distribution and concentration of traffic is used to avoid unnecessary bottlenecks . note that the tree @xmath225 is used by the scheme for any value of @xmath249 .    the second",
    "( implicit ) tree structure occurs in the physical layer .",
    "this tree structure appears only for @xmath39 $ ] . in this regime",
    ", the physical layer uses the hierarchical relaying scheme .",
    "it is the hierarchical structure of this scheme that can equivalently be understood as a tree .",
    "the purpose of this second tree structure is to enable distributed multiple - antenna communication , i.e. , to perform cooperative communication .",
    "the scaling results in theorems [ thm : unicast ] and [ thm : multicast ] are up to a factor @xmath139 and hence preserve information at scale @xmath174 for constant @xmath175 ( see also the discussion in section [ sec : implications ] ) . here",
    "we examine in more detail the behavior of this @xmath139 factor and show that in certain situations it can be significantly sharpened .",
    "note first that the outer bound in theorems [ thm : unicast ] and [ thm : multicast ] hold up to a factor @xmath571 , i.e. , poly - logarithmic in @xmath2 .",
    "however , the inner bound holds only up to the aforementioned @xmath188 factor . a closer look at the proofs of the two theorems reveals that the precise inner bound is of order @xmath572 where @xmath106 is the factor in the definition of @xmath498 and @xmath537 ( see and ) . with a more careful analysis ( see @xcite for the details ) , this can be sharpened to essentially @xmath573    the exponent @xmath574 in the inner bound has two causes .",
    "the first is the use of hierarchical relaying ( for @xmath39 $ ] ) .",
    "the second is the operation of the physical layer at level @xmath458 of the tree ( i.e. , to implement communication between the leaf nodes of @xmath225 and their parents ) . indeed at that level ,",
    "we are operating on a square of area @xmath95 and the loss is essentially inversely proportional to that area .",
    "now , the reason why @xmath94 can not be chosen to be larger ( to make this loss smaller ) , is because hierarchical relaying requires a certain amount of regularity in the node placement , which can only be guaranteed for large enough areas .",
    "this suggests that for the @xmath40 regime , where multi - hop communication is used at the physical layer instead of hierarchical relaying , we might be able to significantly improve the inner bound . to this end",
    ", we have to choose more levels in the tree @xmath225 , such that at the last level before the tree nodes , we are operating on a square that has an area of order @xmath9 . changing the three - layer architecture in this manner , and choosing @xmath106 appropriately , for @xmath40 the inner bound can be improved to @xmath575 in @xmath2 .",
    "combined with the poly - logarithmic outer bound , this yields a @xmath576 approximation of the balanced unicast and multicast capacity regions for @xmath40 .",
    "theorems [ thm : unicast ] and [ thm : multicast ] describe the scaling of the balanced unicast and multicast capacity regions @xmath112 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "as we have argued , the balanced unicast region @xmath112 coincides with the unicast capacity region @xmath111 along at least @xmath13 out of @xmath0 total dimensions , and the balanced multicast region @xmath120 coincides with the multicast capacity region @xmath111 along at least @xmath14 out of @xmath15 total dimensions . however , the proofs of these results provide also bounds for traffic that is not balanced , i.e. , for the remaining @xmath16 dimensions .",
    "define the following two regions : @xmath577 and @xmath578 @xmath523 and @xmath579 differ in that for @xmath92 , @xmath523 only bounds traffic flow out of @xmath104 , whereas @xmath579 bounds traffic in both directions across @xmath104 ( and similar for @xmath580 and @xmath581 ) .    the analysis in sections [ sec : proof_unicast ] and",
    "[ sec : proof_multicast ] shows that @xmath582 with probability @xmath137 as @xmath98 . in other words",
    ", we obtain an inner and an outer bound on the capacity regions @xmath111 and @xmath119 .",
    "these bounds coincide in the scaling sense for balanced traffic , for which we recover theorems [ thm : unicast ] and [ thm : multicast ] .",
    "the discussion in section [ sec : nonbalanced ] reveals that in order to obtain scaling information for traffic that is not balanced , a stronger version of the converse results in lemma [ thm : cutset ] is needed .",
    "in particular , lemma [ thm : cutset ] bounds the sum - rate @xmath583 for @xmath47 .",
    "the required stronger version of the lemma would also need to bound sum rates in the other direction , i.e. , @xmath584    for large path - loss exponents @xmath140 , such a stronger version of lemma [ thm : cutset ] holds ( see lemma [ thm : cutset3 ] ) . with this",
    ", we obtain that for @xmath140 , @xmath585 with probability @xmath137 as @xmath98 .",
    "in other words , in the high path - loss exponent regime @xmath140 , @xmath579 and @xmath581 characterize the scaling of the entire unicast and multicast capacity regions , respectively .",
    "so far , we have only discussed _ extended _ networks , i.e. , @xmath2 nodes are located on a square of area @xmath2 .",
    "we now briefly sketch how these results can be recast for _ dense _ networks , in which @xmath2 nodes are located on a square of unit area .",
    "note first that by rescaling power by a factor @xmath586 , a dense network with any path - loss exponent @xmath249 can essentially be transformed into an equivalent extended network with path - loss exponent @xmath587 .",
    "in particular , any scheme for extended networks with path - loss exponent @xmath587 yields a scheme with same performance for dense networks with any path - loss exponent @xmath249 ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section v.a ) ) . to optimize the resulting scheme for the dense network , we start with the scheme for extended networks corresponding to @xmath587 close to @xmath38 .",
    "hence an inner bound for the unicast and multicast capacity regions for dense networks with path - loss exponent @xmath249 can be obtained from the ones for extended networks by taking a limit as @xmath588 .",
    "moreover , an application of lemma [ thm : cutset2 ] yields a matching ( in the scaling sense ) outer bound .    the resulting approximate balanced capacity regions @xmath128 and @xmath144 have particularly simple shapes in this limit .",
    "in fact , the only constraints in and that can be tight are at level @xmath589 .",
    "moreover , as in section [ sec : large ] , it can be shown that the restriction of balanced traffic is not necessary for dense networks .",
    "this results in the following approximate capacity regions for dense networks : @xmath590 for unicast , and @xmath591 for multicast .",
    "we obtain that for dense networks , for any @xmath31 , @xmath592 with probability @xmath137 as @xmath98 .",
    "in this paper , we have obtained an explicit information - theoretic characterization of the scaling of the @xmath0-dimensional balanced unicast and @xmath1-dimensional balanced multicast capacity regions of a wireless network with @xmath2 randomly placed nodes and assuming a gaussian fading channel model .",
    "these regions span at least @xmath13 and @xmath14 dimensions of @xmath593 and @xmath594 , respectively , and hence determine the scaling of the unicast capacity region along at least @xmath13 out of @xmath0 dimensions and the scaling of the multicast capacity region along at least @xmath14 out of @xmath15 dimensions .",
    "the characterization is in terms of @xmath16 weighted cuts , which are based on the geometry of the locations of the source nodes and their destination nodes and on the traffic demands between them , and thus can be readily evaluated .",
    "this characterization is obtained by establishing that the unicast and multicast capacity regions of a capacitated ( wireline , noiseless ) tree graph under routing have essentially the same scaling as that of the original network .",
    "the leaf nodes of this tree graph correspond to the nodes in the wireless network , and internal nodes of the tree graph correspond to hierarchically growing sets of nodes .",
    "this equivalence suggests a three - layer communication architecture for achieving the entire balanced unicast and multicast capacity regions ( in the scaling sense ) .",
    "the top or routing layer establishes paths from each of the source nodes to its destination ( for unicast ) or set of destinations ( for multicast ) over the tree graph .",
    "the middle or cooperation layer provides this tree abstraction to the routing layer by distributing the traffic among the corresponding set of nodes as a message travels up the tree graph , and by concentrating the traffic on to the corresponding set of nodes as a message travels down the tree .",
    "the bottom or physical layer implements this distribution and concentration of traffic over the wireless network .",
    "this implementation depends on the path - loss exponent : for low path loss , @xmath595 $ ] , hierarchical relaying is used , while for high path loss ( @xmath40 ) , multi - hop communication is used .",
    "this scheme also establishes that a separation based approach , in which the routing layer works essentially independently of the physical layer , can achieve nearly the entire balanced unicast and multicast capacity regions in the scaling sense .",
    "thus , for balanced traffic , such techniques as network coding can provide at most a small increase in the scaling .",
