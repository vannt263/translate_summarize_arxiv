    "a microscopic description of nuclear collective modes is still a very important and interesting problem studied in the theory of nuclear structure . in a frame of the shell model",
    "such a description is difficult to obtain because of a very large size of the basis required to include all necessary configurations .",
    "for example , only very recently excellent shell - model results for rotational states in @xmath3cr have been obtained @xcite .",
    "although many phenomenological approaches can , and have been constructed , their microscopic derivation from the shell model is often not entirely accomplished .",
    "it is therefore important to analyze and study approaches which are able to provide a simultaneous description of collective and single - particle phenomena .",
    "the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite constitutes an effective method to deal with collective degrees of freedom while starting from a pure many - fermion description .",
    "moreover , it may also yield an exact quantum mechanical formalism , and only the choice of generating functions and a generator coordinate decides whether we can find exact solutions , collective as well as noncollective , to the actual problem .",
    "the configuration mixing feature which is by construction built in into the gcm provides us with the ideal tool to study microscopic foundations of collective models .    in the present study",
    ", we apply the gcm to a microscopic model of a single-@xmath0 shell filled with even number of identical nucleons interacting via pairing - plus - quadrupole hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "although the model is very simple , it contains two main ingredients of the `` real '' nuclear structure theories , i.e. , the quadrupole deformation and the pairing correlations , and at the same time for low values of @xmath0 it is relatively easy to solve . on the other hand ,",
    "the gcm is well suited to study this model for large values of @xmath0 where the exact solutions are inaccessible .    in the past",
    "the single-@xmath0 shell model has been studied by many authors .",
    "mulhall and sips @xcite found that even for 4 particles occupying single-@xmath0 shell with strong quadrupole - quadrupole force the collective effects are important and rotational structures are present in the spectra .",
    "deformability , i.e. , a competition between the quadrupole force and the pairing , was studied in a series of papers by baranger and kumar @xcite .",
    "arima @xcite discussed excited rotational level structures ( @xmath4=2 bands ) appearing in the single-@xmath0 shell .",
    "friedman and kelson @xcite analyzed collective spectra as depending on particle number and @xmath0 .",
    "the present paper aims at using the gcm as a filter which would select collective structures among the complete shell - model spectrum .",
    "such a study may give us more confidence in using the gcm in more realistic cases where the quality of approximations involved is difficult to analyze .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way : in sec .",
    "[ sec1a ] we fix notation by briefly reviewing the pairing - plus - quadrupole model in a single-@xmath0 shell and then in sec .  [ sec4a ] we present the available exact solutions .",
    "the key point of the gcm is the construction of the generating states , which we present in sec .",
    "[ sec1b ] by invoking the single particle coherent excitation model ( scem ) of dobaczewski and rohoziski @xcite . in this model",
    "the quadrupole excitations are build using the single - particle quadrupole operator . in the present study",
    "we restore the broken particle - number and angular - momentum symmetries exactly .",
    "this is done in a consistent gcm framework by using the gauge angle and the euler angles as generator coordinates .",
    "the particle - number projection @xcite is based on the fomenko method @xcite in which integrals are replaced by finite sums , sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , and a similar method is also used to perform the angular momentum projection @xcite , sec .",
    "[ sec1c ] .",
    "a description of the gcm calculations in the intrinsic frame of reference is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec4b ] we analyze the gcm results for @xmath0=15/2 and @xmath1=8 particles and compare them with the exact calculations . in sec .",
    "[ sec4c ] we present the gcm spectra for @xmath0=31/2 and @xmath1=4 , and for particle numbers between 6 and 14 , where the exact solutions are not available .",
    "we consider the @xmath5 + 1)-fold degenerate single shell of angular momentum @xmath0 filled with even number @xmath1 of identical particles , which without the interaction is assumed to be at zero energy .",
    "the hamiltonian is composed of the pairing - plus - quadrupole interaction , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the pair transfer operator and @xmath8 is the quadrupole moment operator ,    @xmath9    while @xmath10 and @xmath11 are pairing and quadrupole coupling constants , respectively .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ s1 ] ) describes basic collective correlations between nucleons @xcite and it has been used by many authors @xcite .    in the present paper we aim at solving the pairing - plus - quadrupole model in a large single-@xmath0 shell .",
    "dimensions of the many - fermion space increase rapidly with @xmath0 and the exact solutions become inaccessible very fast .",
    "for example , in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 representations the maximum dimensions for @xmath0=15/2 are @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , while for @xmath0=31/2 they are as large as @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the generator coordinate method , which we apply in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] to this problem , is able to describe low lying collective states without using very large matrices .",
    "here we present solutions for the values of particle number @xmath1 and single - particle angular momentum @xmath0 for which in the @xmath12 representation the dimensions of the many - particle space are not larger than 5000 .      in fig .",
    "[ f11 ] we show the yrast bands for @xmath1=8 particles in the @xmath0=15/2 shell obtained with several values of the coupling constants @xmath10 and @xmath11 , see eq .",
    "[ s1 ] . using the parametrizations @xmath10=(1@xmath18@xmath191  mev and @xmath11=@xmath201  mev",
    "we show a transition from the pairing ( seniority ) limit at @xmath21=0 to a large - deformation limit at @xmath21=1 . it can be seen that for @xmath21@xmath221 the spectra are strongly influenced by the fixed - seniority structures which at @xmath21=0 appear as degenerate multiplets . since in this paper",
    "we want to discuss situations corresponding to collective quadrupole excitations , in the following we present only the results for the pure quadrupole - quadrupole force , i.e. , we set @xmath10=0 and @xmath11=1  mev .    in fig .",
    "[ f13](a ) we present the yrast bands for @xmath1=4 particles interacting with the quadrupole - quadrupole interaction in shells corresponding to @xmath0 between 15/2 and 31/2 . at low spins , regular rotational - like bands are obtained with moments of inertia @xmath23=@xmath24 varying between 51  @xmath25/mev for @xmath0=15/2 and 333  @xmath25/mev for @xmath0=31/2 , and the corresponding @xmath26 ratios varying between 3.23 and 3.32 ( @xmath27 denotes the excitation energy above the ground state ) .    at higher spins",
    "the ground - state bands are crossed by bands built on high-@xmath4 particle - hole excitations , which can easily be identified with oblate structures . in the nilsson single - particle diagram presented in fig .",
    "[ f16 ] for @xmath0=15/2 , we see that at the oblate side the four particles occupy the @xmath28=15/2 and 13/2 orbitals",
    ". therefore the lowest single - particle excitation corresponds to promoting a particle from @xmath28=13/2 to @xmath28=11/2 which gives the @xmath4=13/2 + 11/2=12 excitation and leads to a band head at @xmath29=12 .",
    "similarly , for larger values of @xmath0 one obtains band heads at larger even values of spin .    for @xmath1=6 particles , fig .",
    "[ f13](b ) , we see the bands which correspond to 2p-2h oblate configurations . for example , for @xmath0=21/2 the p - h band corresponds to exciting the @xmath28=17/2 particle to the @xmath28=15/2 orbital ( @xmath4=16 ) and then the second p - h excitation aligns the @xmath28=19/2 particle to the @xmath28=13/2 orbital leading to @xmath4=32 and giving the band head at @xmath29=32 .",
    "we see that for small shell - filling factors @xmath1/(2@xmath0 + 1 ) the high-@xmath4 bands appear at very low energies , while they cease to be yrast for larger shell - filling factors .",
    "for example , for @xmath1=8 and 10 , figs .",
    "[ f13](c ) and ( d ) , no yrast high-@xmath4 bands are seen and only yrast - yrare band interaction is visible at @xmath29=12 for the lowest @xmath0=19/2 and @xmath1=8 bands . in general , the yrast bands for half - filled shells present regular collective structures , although they do not have pure rotational character , for example , @xmath26=1.92 for the @xmath0=@xmath1@xmath181/2=15/2 band .",
    "this is due to the @xmath30-instability of the corresponding potential energy surface ( pes ) , see fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) .    the complete spectrum of 526 states for @xmath1=8 particles in the @xmath0=15/2 shell is presented in fig .",
    "the lines connect states with the largest e2 reduced matrix elements of the quadrupole operator .",
    "only the stretched @xmath31=2 matrix elements are considered .",
    "the lowest @xmath32 state is connected to the @xmath33 state with which it has the largest e2 matrix element .",
    "then the first excited @xmath32 state is connected to one of the remaining @xmath33 states , and the procedure is continued for still higher @xmath32 states .",
    "after that all remaining @xmath33 states are considered to be the band heads . in the next step",
    "the @xmath33 states are considered by order of increasing energy and connected to the @xmath34 states . in this way",
    "all even spins are connected into bands and then the same procedure is repeated for odd spin values .",
    "several regular collective bands can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f14 ] . these will be used to discuss the ability of the gcm to select collective structures in the sea of all possible eigenstates , sec .",
    "[ sec4b ] .",
    "here we only discuss a possible interpretation of lowest states in terms of the collective model . in table",
    "[ t5 ] we present the reduced e2 matrix elements between five lowest @xmath32 and @xmath33 states . it can be seen that these matrix elements obey a strong selection rule related to the special symmetry of the half - filled shell .",
    "indeed , the quadrupole operator ( [ a2a ] ) is odd with respect to changing the creation operator into the annihilation operator and _ vice versa_. therefore , the quadrupole - quadrupole hamiltonian is invariant with respect to such a change and the spectra of systems containing @xmath1 and 2@xmath0 + 1@xmath18@xmath1 particles are strictly identical .",
    "however , for a half - filled shell @xmath1 is equal to 2@xmath0 + 1@xmath18@xmath1 and the above symmetry allows to attribute a new dychotomic quantum number to every eigenstate , while the quadrupole operator may only connect states with these quantum numbers being different .",
    "an approximate interpretation of the lowest states can be done in terms of the collective jean - wilets model @xcite , which describes collective states for the @xmath30-unstable pes . in this model",
    "the lowest - order quadrupole transition operator changes the seniority quantum number by one and therefore the parity of the seniority can be associated with the dychotomic quantum number discussed above . in this way",
    "the @xmath35 and @xmath36 states can be identified with seniority zero and three and the three lowest @xmath33 states with seniority one , two , and four . in this scheme",
    "the states @xmath37 and @xmath38 can be interpreted as mixtures of the seniority six states with the seniority zero @xmath39 vibrations , and the states @xmath40 and @xmath41 as mixtures of seniority five and seven with seniority one @xmath39 vibrations .",
    "this interpretation is however not manifested in the energy spectra , where the characteristic jean - wilets multiplets are strongly split .",
    "one can also note that if the identification of the @xmath39 vibrations is correct , the corresponding energy is rather high as compared to the energy of the motion in the @xmath30 direction .",
    "this high energy may also suggest that the collective @xmath30 vibrations are here directly mixed to non - collective states and that the @xmath39 vibrations are absent in the model .",
    "the first excited band can be interpreted as the @xmath30 vibration strongly coupled to rotations due to the @xmath30-instability of the corresponding pes , fig .",
    "[ f2](a ) . at spin @xmath29=8",
    "it is perturbed by a coupling to the lowest noncollective excitation promoting the @xmath28=7/2 particle to the @xmath28=9/2 state ( if one considers the oblate side of the nilsson diagram , fig .",
    "[ f16 ] ) . however , one is here unable to distinguish between the oblate and prolate structures , because the prolate side suggests an excitation of the @xmath28=9/2 particle to the @xmath28=7/2 state , which gives the same value of spin @xmath29=8 .",
    "for @xmath0=31/2 the exact solutions are available for @xmath1=4 only , fig .",
    "the collective bands are identified by the same procedure as described above using the reduced matrix elements of the quadrupole operator . at low spins",
    "one can see several regular bands which can be fairly well interpreted in terms of the @xmath30 vibrations coupled to an axial rotor with @xmath4 being approximately a good quantum number . in this interpretation ,",
    "the ground - state band is the @xmath4=0 and @xmath42=0 band and the first excited band has @xmath4=2 and @xmath42=1 .",
    "then come two @xmath42=2 bands with @xmath4=4 and @xmath4=0 followed by two @xmath42=3 bands with @xmath4=6 and @xmath4=2 .",
    "one may even identify three @xmath42=4 bands with @xmath4=8 , 4 , and 0 .",
    "again , in this interpretation there is no room for the @xmath39 vibrations at low energies @xcite .",
    "table  [ t6 ] shows the e2 reduced matrix elements between the lowest @xmath32 and @xmath33 states and confirms the above interpretation .",
    "a clear decrease of the matrix elements with the difference in the number of @xmath30-vibrational quanta is manifest , however , the strict @xmath43@xmath441 selection rule is not present .",
    "similarly as for the yrast bands , fig .  [ f13 ] , one may easily recognize in the spectrum of fig .",
    "[ f10 ] the bands built on the oblate particle - hole excitations .",
    "together with the excitation of the @xmath28=29/2 particle to the @xmath28=27/2 orbital , which becomes yrast at @xmath29=28 , one can also identify the excitations of the same particle to the @xmath28=25/2 , 23/2 , 21/2 , and 19/2 orbitals .",
    "one may clearly see the effect of decreasing e2 probability when the band terminates ; the band heads are then coupled stronger to adjacent bands then to the next members of the given band .",
    "the single - particle coherent excitation model ( scem ) proposed by dobaczewski and rohoziski @xcite is based on the assumption that the quadrupole excitations can be constructed by acting with the quadrupole fermion operator @xmath45 on a reference state of the form @xmath46 i.e. , @xmath47 where @xmath48 creates a monopole collective pair of particles and @xmath49 is a single - particle quadrupole excitation operator . since",
    "only one operator of a given mutipolarity can be constructed in the single-@xmath0 shell , here @xmath50@xmath51@xmath7 and @xmath45@xmath51@xmath8 . in the scem , for @xmath52=0",
    "we obtain one state of @xmath29=0 and for @xmath52=1 one state of @xmath29=2 .",
    "if for every value of @xmath52 we orthogonalize the scem states with respect to those obtained for @xmath52@xmath181 , we obtain the numbers of states listed in table  [ t1 ] for @xmath0=15/2 and @xmath1=8 .",
    "it can be seen that for low values of @xmath52 the numbers of states of a given @xmath29 exactly correspond to those of the five - dimensional harmonic oscillator @xcite with @xmath52 phonons , or to the numbers of @xmath53 excitations required to create the interacting - boson - model states @xcite from the s - boson condensate @xmath54 .",
    "however , scem being a true fermion model , there are departures from this rule appearing as soon as @xmath52 reaches half of the shell s maximum particle number @xmath0 + 1/2 ( i.e. , in table  [ t1 ] from @xmath52=4 on ) , which reflect the effect of the pauli correlations .",
    "it is obvious that states of the angular momentum @xmath29 can only be obtained for @xmath52@xmath55@xmath56 and therefore the number of excitations @xmath52 plays the role of the cut - off in spin .",
    "the generating function of the gcm is here constructed as a condensate of the @xmath45 excitations acting on a condensate of the @xmath48 pairs @xmath57 the parameters @xmath58 and @xmath59 are a scalar and a quadrupole numerical tensors , respectively , and are used as the generator coordinates .",
    "we use the notation of the scalar product defined as and assume that @xmath60=@xmath61 and @xmath58=@xmath62 .    for the gcm state ( [ a3 ] )",
    "neither the particle number nor the angular momentum is a good quantum number .",
    "it can , however , be decomposed into the scem states ( [ a1b ] ) which , with a proper angular momentum coupling of the excitation operators @xmath45 , have good angular momentum and particle number .",
    "the average value of the particle number in the generating function ( [ a3 ] ) increases with the @xmath58 parameter .",

    "can be rapidly obtained by using the @xmath66 matrix in its eigen - reference - frame , which corresponds to transforming the tensor @xmath59 to the intrinsic system defined by conditions @xmath71 and then diagonalizing the mean field @xmath66 in the intrinsic frame . in cases",
    "when the @xmath48 pair has the seniority form , i.e. , contains pairs of time - reversed states with equal amplitudes as is in the single-@xmath0 shell ( [ a4a ] ) , we may further simplify expression ( [ a8 ] ) by using the fact that @xmath66 is a time - even matrix , i.e. , @xmath72",
    "it is well known that the gcm for the gauge angle and the euler angles used as generator coordinates is equivalent to the exact particle - number and angular - momentum projections @xcite . in the present study we use this property to restore those broken symmetries exactly , and",

    "[ f14 ] or table  [ t2 ] , and the overlap matrix has the same number of large eigenvalues separated by 10 orders of magnitude from the remaining 12 eigenvalues which represent the numerical noise .",
    "this illustrates a rare situation when the gcm generating functions exhaust the corresponding hilbert space completely .    a more typical spectrum of the overlap matrix appears for @xmath29=6 , where the total number of eigenvalues equals to 76 ( its dimension equals the product of the number of points ( 19 ) and of the number of @xmath4 components ( 4 ) , @xmath4=0,2,4 , and 6 ) .",
    "even if this dimension is larger then the number of the exact @xmath29=6 states ( 31 ) , the gcm generating functions do not exhaust the hilbert space and no gap in the overlap spectrum occurs . in calculating the square root of the overlap one has to decide how many norm eigenvalues should be retained .",
    "since the negative eigenvalues reflect the appearance of the numerical noise , their magnitude can be used as an indication of how much the results are perturbed by numerical uncertainties .",

    "we may see this kind of effect in many other examples and one may interpret it as a manifestation of the coupling of collective and non - collective degrees of freedom . within this interpretation , for @xmath162=4 the gcm correctly singles out the fourth collective state , which in reality is fragmented among the forth and the fifth exact states .    as soon as we include in the basis more states than the critical value @xmath161",

    "the exact spectrum is obtained for @xmath162@xmath44@xmath161=16 , because the full hilbert space is then again exhausted by the gcm generating functions .",
    "it is interesting to note that for 10 mesh points the fifth exact state appears only beyond the value of @xmath162=@xmath161 .",
    "this may illustrate an approximate character of our prescription to define the critical value @xmath161 . for 19 points the fifth state is stable already at @xmath162=@xmath161@xmath182 .    based on this results",
    "we will suppose in what follows that using a relatively small number of mesh points of the intrinsic deformations ( as compared to the number of exact states ) , one obtains a fair description of the collective subspace , and that only states with strong collective components are then present in the gcm spectra . by increasing the number of mesh points one includes noncollective configurations and the gcm yields collective states mixed with the noncollective ones .",
    "a separation of states into the collective and noncollective subspace is of course not a well defined procedure ( both in the experiment and in the exactly solvable model discussed here ) . which states are called collective is therefore a subject of a model interpretation . with increasing excitation energy the collectivity",

    "these turn out to be useful criteria of identifying spurious states , because as soon as the spurious states start mixing with the physical ones the above average values become perturbed , even if the symmetries have been exactly restored when calculating the gcm kernels .    in the gcm spectra",
    "there is no @xmath167 states because they belong to representations of the point group @xmath168 which are not included in the present calculations .",

    "this is not a case for the @xmath1=8 and @xmath29=2 states in the @xmath0=15/2 shell discussed here because the gcm reproduces these states exactly . on the other hand",

    "one should also stress that the standard bohr collective quadrupole model @xcite describes the symmetric states only .    comparing the results for 10 and 19 points , fig .",

    "a similar analysis of the @xmath29=2 states , fig .

    "but even for @xmath1=14 the low - energy collective bands are visible .",
    "on the other hand , for the @xmath30-unstable case corresponding to the half - filled shell ( @xmath1=16 ) , we could not obtain any stable gcm solutions even by using the 19-point mesh of generating coordinates .",
