    "in recent years , relaying has been accepted by several standards such as ieee 802.11s , ieee 802.16j and lte - advanced as a powerful technique to provide spatial diversity in cooperation systems and extend the coverage of the wireless networks . however , as shown in @xcite , the employment of relay doubles the required channels for transmission from source to destination due to the half - duplex constraint , which induces the spectral efficiency loss .    to improve the spectral efficiency ,",
    "two - way relaying ( twr ) or bi - directional relaying , which employs the idea of network coding ( nc ) , has been investigated in @xcite-@xcite . in twr",
    ", two terminals transmit their signals to a relay in one or two phases , and then the relay broadcasts the combination of the information extracted from the received signals . in @xcite,@xcite , the authors studied the two - phase twr ( 2p - twr ) protocol with an amplify - and - forward ( af ) relay .",
    "wherein , the outage probability and diversity - multiplexing tradeoff have been analyzed .",
    "the performance and relay selection strategy of 2p - twr protocol with multiple mobile relays were studied in @xcite .",
    "the af - based three - phase twr ( 3p - twr ) protocol has been analyzed in @xcite , where the expression of outage probability has been obtained and the optimal power allocation scheme at the relay has been presented . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors analyzed the performance of optimal relay selection for 3p - twr protocol in nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels and presented the closed - form expression for outage probability . in @xcite",
    ", the authors showed that , in the interference free scenario , the 2p - twr protocol outperforms 3p - twr protocol in ergodic sum rate , while the 3p - twr protocol performs better in outage and ber performances when the direct channel between two terminals exists .    in practical wireless network , signals of terminals ( or relay )",
    "are often corrupted by co - channel interference ( cci ) from other sources that share the same frequency resources in wireless networks @xcite .",
    "moreover , cci often dominates awgn in wireless networks with dense frequency reuse .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to take the effect of cci into serious consideration in the analysis and design of the practical twr protocol . some of the previous studies have investigated the performance of twr protocol in the interference - limited scenario .",
    "for example , the outage and ber performances of single terminal for two - phase af - based twr protocol have been analyzed in @xcite for the interference - limited scenario .",
    "but this work considered only the special case that all interferers have the identical average interference power and the interference channels are independent identically distributed . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigated the 2p - twr in a more general scenario where interferers have different average interference powers .",
    "the expression of system outage probability @xcite was derived . in @xcite , the system outage performance of af - based twr protocol",
    "was analyzed using the a novel geometric method .",
    "very recently , the effect of cci was analyzed for twr protocol in nakagami-@xmath0 fading channels and the optimal resource allocation scheme was developed @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of the authors knowledge , none of the aforementioned publications considered the performance of 3p - twr protocol in the interference - limited scenario .",
    "the 3p - twr protocol is suitable for the scenarios where the reliability has a higher priority in the system . as a result ,",
    "it is of great importance to analyze the effect of cci on the 3p - twr protocol .",
    "moreover , in this paper , we will show that the 3p - twr protocol may outperform 2p - twr protocol in ergodic sum rate when the effect of the cci is taken into consideration .",
    "this contradicts with the conclusion obtained in the interference free scenario .    in this work",
    ", we study the performance of three - phase af - based twr protocol with direct channel between two terminals ( this protocol is also called time division broadcasting protocol in @xcite ) in the interference - limited scenario .",
    "a general model that all nodes ( terminals and relay ) are interfered by a finite number of co - channel interferers in the independent but non - identical rayleigh fading channels is considered .",
    "the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows :    * the lower bounds for outage probability and sum bit error rate ( ber ) with infinite series are derived , which are shown to provide excellent estimation to the exact results obtained by simulation .",
    "* the approximate expressions without infinite series and asymptotic expressions for outage probability and sum ber are derived , which are tight in the low and high snr regions , respectively .",
    "the approximate expression for ergodic sum rate is also obtained . * the optimal power allocation at the relay and optimal relay location , which aiming to minimize the outage and sum ber performances ,",
    "are studied based on the asymptotic analysis .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follow . in the next section",
    ", we will describe the system model and present the expression for the received signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) at terminal .",
    "the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the received sinr at terminal is determined in section iii . the outage , sum ber and ergodic sum rate performances are analyzed in section iv , section v and section vi , respectively . the optimal power allocation and relay location problems",
    "are studied in section vii .",
    "simulation results are presented in section viii and some conclusions will be drawn in the last section .",

    "in two - way relaying , there are two opposite traffic flows : one is from @xmath1 via @xmath3 to @xmath2 , and the other is from @xmath2 via @xmath3 to @xmath1 .",
    "so the _ system outage probability _ is an important and commonly - used metric to evaluate the system performance @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the system outage probability of 2p - twr protocol can be efficiently derived by the geometric method proposed by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the method can hardly be used in this paper since the non - outage probability @xcite for 3p - twr protocol can not be expressed as in the form ( or similar form ) of [ 12 , eq .",
    "9 ] due to the presence of direct channel .    to circumvent this obstacle",
    ", we first consider the definition of system outage probability .",
    "the system outage event occurs when the mutual information at either of the terminals falls below the target rate , or equivalently , the received sinr at either of the terminals is below the target sinr @xmath94 .",
    "then the system outage probability for the 3p - twr protocol @xmath95 can be written as @xmath96 where @xmath97 denotes the outage probability at terminal @xmath37 with target sinr @xmath98 .",
    "the third step is obtained by assuming @xmath99 and @xmath100 are independent .",
    "as will be shown in the next subsection , the above approximation gives rise to an upper bound to the exact system outage probability when the transmitted power goes into infinity .",
    "in the below , we employ the following performance metric @xmath101 which is called the protocol outage probability , to evaluate the system outage performance approximately , because this metric requires only the outage probability at single terminal .",

    "it is shown that the protocol outage probability provides a good approximation to system outage probability especially in the moderate and high snr regions ( @xmath104db ) .",
    "although a gap can be observed in the low snr region ( see fig .",
    "2(b ) ) , the result based on ( 18 ) is still much tighter than the results based on the asymptotic method in @xcite . as a result",

    "_    the proof is straightforward according to ( 18 ) , and thus it is neglect .",
    "note that the approximate expression of protocol outage probability does not require the computation of infinite series according to lemma 2 .      to get more insight about the effect of system parameters on the protocol outage probability , we provide asymptotic analysis based on the result in lemma 3 .",

    "moreover , from theorem 2 , it is clear that the protocol outage probability increases as the average received interference powers at @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 increasing and decreases as the useful power increasing .",
    "moreover , since we have @xmath126 , @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) , it is easy to show that the protocol outage probability is proportional to a constant when the ratio of interference power @xmath21 to useful power @xmath130 is fixed .",
