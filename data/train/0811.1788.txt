    "compact objects such as neutron stars @xcite have radii very close to their schwarzschild radii and hence general relativity should be used to describe the gravity close to their surface . neglecting rotation ,",
    "the geometry of space - time can be described using the well known spherically symmetric schwarzschild geometry and information on the ratio @xmath0 of a compact object can be obtained from the ( observed ) gravitational redshift ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this is a useful , model - independent way , to gain insight into properties of neutron stars and white dwarfs .",
    "although it is a model - independent procedure , it relies on certain basic assumptions , like the absence of rotation and a perfect spherical symmetry ( i.e. zero quadrupole moment ) . to gain a deeper understanding it makes then sense to relax some of these assumptions and to examine what information can be extracted from the gravitational redshift in the more general case . in the present paper",
    ", we shall study the situation with a non - zero angular velocity @xmath1 , but assuming that the object is rigid enough to allow the approximation of a negligible quadrupole moment .",
    "in particular , when rotation is taken into account , spherical symmetry is lost and off diagonal terms appear in the metric which has the following general form :    @xmath2    the exact form of this metric including magnetic field , quadrupole moment and even radiation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) is still a subject of research .",
    "we will use a first and second order approximation to this metric neglecting the effects of the quadrupole moment and the magnetic field .",
    "furthermore , it is expected that only relatively young neutron stars can have a differential rotation @xcite ( encountered also in boson stars @xcite ) which we therefore neglect here .",
    "+ deriving the gravitational redshift from ( [ general metric ] ) we will show that , for a fixed mass , a unique solution for the radius of the compact object does not exist .",
    "instead , we obtain two different solutions which can differ by orders of magnitude as long as the angular velocity is not too large . in this case",
    ", all theoretical models still favor the solution of the smaller radius and we can select this solution without the necessity to refer to some details of a specific model . with increasing angular momentum , the two radii approach each other and",
    "the above selection rule is not effective anymore .",
    "however , in such a case we can define a narrow range of allowed radii which is still a valuable model independent information for fast rotating objects .",
    "+ as a bonus of our examination of the properties of the gravitational redshift @xmath3 , we can show that there exists an upper bound on the angular velocity depending on the redshift .",
    "one can even put an absolute upper bound which is independent of @xmath3 .",
    "interestingly the bounds come out to be in the range of the observed millisecond pulsars .",
    "this in turn allows us to assume that the angular velocity of millisecond pulsars is indeed approaching its maximal value .",
    "the consequences of this assumption will be discussed in the text below .",
    "one of them is the confirmation of the result that the light emitted in very fast millisecond pulsars stems mostly from the equatorial region ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we compare our results to the so called ` mass shedding limit ' @xcite and to other work related to the maximum angular velocity .",
    "+ one of the main results of the paper , discussed in section four , is that our analytical formula on maximal angular velocity is comparable to results obtained by using extensive numerical calculations . in particular , we agree with the numerical findings of reference @xcite . + the essential parameters which enter our equations are the radius @xmath4 , the angular velocity @xmath1 and the mass @xmath5 .",
    "the minimum central density at which a neutron star is stable is simply the density at which neutrons become unstable to beta decay ( @xmath6 @xcite ) .",
    "using the well known oppenheimer - volkov @xcite equations and a plausible equation of state , one can construct a stellar model which provides the minimum mass of the neutron star to be around @xmath7 which is a bit unrealistic taking into account that neutron stars are remnants of supernova explosions @xcite .",
    "a more realistic value for the minimum mass is of the order of @xmath8 @xcite , which is actually closer the maximum mass of a white dwarf ( @xmath9 ) . the maximum mass of a neutron star can be found from causality arguments @xcite , by recalling that the speed of sound in dense matter has to be less than the speed of light ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "this condition gives a maximum mass of @xmath11 .",
    "the radii corresponding to the maximum and minimum masses can be found using the oppenheimer - volkov equation .",
    "assuming an equation of state for a degenerate neutron fluid , the corresponding radii for the two extreme masses lie in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 .",
    "this radius range can of course change if one uses a more sophisticated equation of state , subject of current controversy @xcite , but the orders of magnitude remain the same @xcite .",
    "the canonical neutron star mass and radius are thought to be @xmath14 and @xmath12 .",
    "a useful observational quantity , which agrees in order of magnitude with theoretical predictions , is the mean `` measured '' mass of the neutron stars in a gaussian ensemble @xcite , namely @xmath15 this value will be used if no other information on the masses is available .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we will briefly discuss the gravitational redshift as emerging from a perturbative axial symmetric metric . in section three we will use these results to determine the radius or the range of the radii of the compact object .",
    "section four is devoted to the maximal angular velocity derived within our approach . in section five",
    "we discuss some improvements by taking into account more terms in the expansion of the metric . in section six",
    "we apply our results to some chosen compact objects like a white dwarf and neutron stars .",
    "finally , in section seven we present our conclusions .",
    "a far away observer can measure a pulsar s angular velocity @xmath1 , given by @xmath16 using ( [ omega ] ) , the four velocity of a stationary point on the surface can be written as @xmath17 through the normalization condition of the four velocity @xmath18 , we obtain the time - like component of the four velocity in terms of the metric ( [ general metric ] ) and angular velocity @xmath1 : @xmath19 the redshift factor can be calculated simply by recalling that the energy of radial a photon ( @xmath20 ) is simply @xcite @xmath21 with @xmath22 an affine parameter and @xmath23 and @xmath24 conserved quantities due to the existence of two killing vectors . as a consequence",
    "we can write for @xmath25 @xmath26 and the energy perceived by a distant observer @xmath25 can be now expressed through @xmath27 were @xmath28 is the energy at the surface and @xmath3 is the redshift factor .",
    "explicitly , the latter is given by @xcite @xmath29 this redshift can actually be measured for many objects @xcite . indeed ,",
    "at the end of the paper we will employ the results of such observations .",
    "the behavior of @xmath3 as a function of the radius @xmath4 for a fixed mass is displayed in figure 1a .",
    "+    the calculation of @xmath3 can be made more concrete when we consider the metric ( [ general metric ] ) . to a first approximation , zeldovich and novikov",
    "@xcite apply small perturbations to the schwarzschild geometry .",
    "the elements of the metric ( [ general metric ] ) can be calculated to be @xcite @xmath30    here , the condition for slow rotation is given by @xmath31 ( @xmath32 being the schwarzschild radius ) @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ perturbative metric ] ) allows us to calculate @xmath3 explicitly .",
    "one obtains @xmath33    throughout the paper we will be using the newtonian approximation for the angular momentum , ( @xmath34 ) @xcite . in view of the results obtained in @xcite ,",
    "this is a well - based assumption violated only for extremely high angular velocities ( which are not exceeded here ) . taking this into account , equation ( [ j ] ) simplifies to @xmath35 were @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 are constants given by @xmath39 and we have absorbed @xmath40 into the angular momentum by defining @xmath41 the equations ( [ redshift ] , [ constants ] , [ prime ] ) can be now used to either solve them for the radius by assuming a mean mass or a mass range and a measured angular velocity or , alternatively to predict the redshift .",
    "both ways will be used below .",
    "it is possible to take two different approaches when using equation ( [ redshift equation ] ) .",
    "the first one is to demand that the term inside the parenthesis of ( [ redshift equation ] ) should be greater than zero , such that after factoring out @xmath42 one arrives at @xmath43 the limiting values of @xmath4 correspond to the equal sign in the above equation .",
    "since this does not depend on @xmath3 , these values have an absolute character in the sense that they give the maximal and minimal radius for any compact object with mass @xmath5 and angular velocity @xmath1 regardless of the value of @xmath3 .",
    "similar reasoning applies to any other quantity derived from ( [ f1 ] ) ( e.g. @xmath44 in the next section ) .",
    "+ the behavior of the function @xmath45 versus @xmath4 is shown in figure 1b .",
    "the figure displays the global properties of this function ( which can be also inferred easily analytically ) , like the local maximum and the two zeros , one of them close to the schwarzschild radius .",
    "+ on the other hand , we can solve the following cubic equation for the radii @xmath46 obviously , this is is the same equation as ( [ f1 ] ) if we put @xmath3 to zero in ( [ f2 ] ) .",
    "hence , we can continue examining equation ( [ f2 ] ) and discuss the absolute limits by putting @xmath47 at the end .",
    "the function @xmath48 with non - zero gravitational redshift has the same global properties as ( [ f1 ] ) .",
    "the solutions of ( [ f2 ] ) can be obtained analytically by parameterizing the cardano formulae @xcite . by a simple transformation one can get rid of the quadratic term in the cubic equation arriving at @xmath49 .",
    "depending on the sign of the discriminant @xmath50 , one can parametrize the solution using the auxiliary variable @xmath51 . in our case @xmath52",
    "and we parametrize the solutions through the angle @xmath36 given by @xmath53 the analytical solutions are then    @xmath54    were @xmath55 and @xmath56    in figure 2b we have plotted @xmath57 and @xmath58 versus the angular velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the upper branch of each curve corresponds to the bigger radius meeting the lower value at some @xmath1 ( this will be discussed in the next section in more detail ) .",
    "with growing @xmath1 the difference @xmath59 between the two solutions becomes smaller , however , at relative small angular velocity we can opt safely for the lower value of the obtained radius ( close to the schwarzschild radius ) as this is favored by models .",
    "such a point of view is not possible anymore with increasing @xmath1 .",
    "note also that the solutions @xmath60 do not determine a `` range '' for the radius in the strict sense .",
    "however , since both solutions depend on the mass , a range in the mass will determine a range for each of the two solutions . with this in mind",
    ", we can define a narrow range for the radius which will be explained below . +",
    "a plausible range for the mass can be given by the close extremes in the gaussian distribution ( [ gaussian ] ) as discussed in the introduction .",
    "for every limiting mass we will get a curve like in figure 2 , say @xmath61 for the lower mass and @xmath62 for the upper value .",
    "the curves with an in - between mass will fill the space between the curves @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "a vertical tangent to the cusp @xcite of @xmath61 will intersect the curve @xmath62 in two points , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , which we can take as a definition of range of allowed radii .",
    "the result is a single narrow range which becomes smaller with increasing angular velocity and is zero at a maximum @xmath1 .",
    "for instance , in the case of the neutron star psr b1937 + 21 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 such that @xmath67 .",
    "the existence of the maximum angular velocity corresponding to the cups of every curve allows even to sharpen this concept to be discussed in the next section . + it is of some interest to expand these solutions ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) neglecting small terms@xcite in @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the relevant quantities can now be approximated as @xmath70 and @xmath71    when @xmath72 , one can express @xmath57 and @xmath58 as @xmath73 the final results of our approximation reads @xmath74    note that the first term in @xmath58 is the schwarzschild radius modified by a factor of @xmath75 .",
    "actually , this term is the same result one would obtain by using a spherically symmetric metric with no rotation . + it is important to remember that this approximation starts to fail when @xmath76 , which occurs at @xmath77 .",
    "to understand the origin of a maximal angular velocity it is instructive to look at the generic behavior of the function @xmath48 . as already briefly mentioned , the latter will have two zeros on the positive axis and a local maximum between them . obviously , the case where the local maximum falls below zero is a limiting case corresponding mathematically to @xmath78 or alternatively to @xmath79 ( or in a yet different method setting @xmath80 ( eq . [ xi ] ) and physically corresponding to a maximally allowed angular velocity ) .",
    "the cusps @xcite of the curves in figures ( 2a and 2b ) display this behavior .",
    "after some algebra one obtains @xmath81 as described above , we can obtain the ` absolute ' value of @xmath82 by setting @xmath47 .",
    "this is the ` absolute ' upper bound on the angular velocity which turns out to be @xmath83 a numerical value can be found by taking @xmath84 , so that @xmath85 is only one order of magnitude away from the observed millisecond pulsars . when @xmath3 is different from zero , @xmath82 can be consistent with the largest angular velocities observed in millisecond pulsars@xcite .",
    "the result for typical redshifts around @xmath86 is @xmath87 one can interpret the equation ( [ omax2 ] ) in two different , but related ways . both ways have to do with the evidence that milli - second pulsars are orthogonal rotators ( @xmath88 ) @xcite .",
    "since the right hand side of ( [ omax2 ] ) agrees already with the angular velocity of fast spinning objects , the emission angle @xmath89 must be close to @xmath90 ( see equation ( [ prime ] ) ) .",
    "as we shall see below , this result can in turn be used to learn about the orientation of the magnetic axis in rapidly rotating objects , particularly neutron stars .",
    "+ the standard model for the pulsar emission mechanism was developed independently by pacini @xcite and gold @xcite ( see also lighthouse model @xcite ) , and will now be described briefly .",
    "since the rotation axis is not aligned with the magnetic axis , a changing magnetic field will induce electric fields at the magnetic poles in for example , a neutron star .",
    "these electric fields will eject particles which will follow helicoidal paths around the magnetic field lines .",
    "the ejected particles will in turn , emit a narrow cone ( @xmath91 @xcite ) of radiation parallel to the magnetic axis . from this argument",
    "it can be inferred that the angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis is approximately the same as the emission angle @xmath89 .",
    "+    the emission angle has been measured indirectly for many pulsars by kuzmin and wu @xcite , and in their results , a strong correlation between orthogonal magnetic axes and fast millisecond pulsars is evident .",
    "this measured correlation agrees with our results and the results of @xcite , which favor orthogonal rotators .",
    "+ on the other hand , we can assume the theory outlined above to be valid , which allows us to determine @xmath82 .",
    "indeed , we can even assume that the angular velocity of fast rotating objects is close to the maximally allowed value . in other words we have @xmath92 which essentially , knowing @xmath1 , predicts the redshift .",
    "in turn , we can now extract the value of the radius .",
    "we will discuss this procedure taking realistic examples in the next section .",
    "some examples of the behavior of @xmath93 as a function of the gravitational redshift are shown in figure 3 .",
    "+ there has been a considerable amount of work done related to the maximum angular velocity .",
    "haensel et al .",
    "@xcite , glendenning @xcite and koranda et al .",
    "@xcite have used empirical formulae together with extensive numerical calculations to provide a lower bound for the period of rotation .",
    "haensel et al .",
    "@xcite found the minimum period to be @xmath94 , assuming a mass of @xmath95 .",
    "this period also depends on the minimum bound for the redshift which was found to be @xmath96 @xcite . if we use eq .",
    "( [ maximum angular velocity ] ) ( in accordance with the evidence of milli - second pulsars being orthogonal rotators we use @xmath88 ) and the parameters just mentioned we obtain @xmath97 . however , if we use our absolute bound ( eq . ( [ absolute max ] ) ) and the mass assumed by haensel we obtain the very close value of @xmath98 .",
    "this is just a difference of just 1.4% which is rather gratifying recalling that our result has been obtained analytically by methods different from @xcite .",
    "+ other relevant work has been done related to the `` mass - shedding limit '' ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this limit is conceptually different from what we have found and corresponds to the limit at which the neutron star would break apart .",
    "lattimer and prakash find for this limit @xmath99 which is independent of the equation of state @xcite and applicable for masses not very close the maximum mass .",
    "equation ( [ mass - shedd ] ) can be used for example , to find a limiting radius having an assumed or measured mass . while applying our results to find a radius we will compare our findings to the results when our maximal angular velocity is replaced by the one above . here",
    "we note that that it is not straightforward to compare the radius independent limit ( [ absolute max ] ) with ( [ mass - shedd ] ) as the latter depends explicitly on @xmath4 .",
    "however , it is obvious that both are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "+ the orders of magnitude reached by the maximum angular velocity are quite large , but still less than the condition for slow rotation given by zeldovich and novikov @xcite ; even for the absolute maximum ( equation ( [ absolute max ] ) ) .",
    "the condition for slow rotation ( @xmath31 ) gives @xmath100 which is one order of magnitude larger than our maximum upper bound when we take @xmath101 , and even larger when we compare with the non - zero redshift case .",
    "still , because our maximum angular velocity is comparable to the zeldovich - novikov condition , especially with @xmath102 , we will make a better approximation for the metric in the following section .",
    "even though the perturbative metric ( [ perturbative metric ] ) gives relevant results , a better approximation for the metric is given for instance in @xcite .",

    "the resulting polynomial to be solved to obtain the two solutions for the radius is of fifth order in @xmath4 . in consequence",
    "we can present the solution only numerically .",
    "an inspection of figures 2 and 3 shown that the new results , differ from the previous one only at very high angular velocities . the maximum angular velocity obtained using",
    "the extended metric is slightly higher than the one obtained analytically , so that eq .",
    "( [ maximum angular velocity ] ) for the maximum angular velocity is still a valid bound .",
    "however , in comparison to the first order metric we used before , it becomes clear that the limit on the maximal angular velocity improves , especially for the absolute limit at zero gravitational redshift .",
    "here we shall apply our results to some known compact objects such as sirius b , an isolated neutron star , and several known pulsars .",
    "+ sirius b is the binary companion of the very bright sirius a and is the closest white dwarf to earth .",
    "sirius b has been studied extensively , and the gravitational redshift has been measured accurately with the help of the hubble space telescope @xcite . also , since it is a binary system , its mass has been measured accurately @xcite .",
    "@xmath104 according to eq .",
    "( [ maximum angular velocity ] ) , we get a minimum period of @xmath105 this number does not change very much , had we applied the results from the extended metric .",
    "+ the low mass x - ray binary system exo 0748 - 676 has been studied by cottam et al .",
    "@xcite . they managed to measure spectral absorption lines corresponding to a redshift of    @xmath106    this together with its mass ( assumed to be @xmath107 ) gives @xmath108 the value above has been obtained employing the extended metric ( the corresponding value resulting from the first order approximation is @xmath109 ) .",
    "the period for this neutron star has been measured to be @xmath110@xcite , which is not too far away from the above limit given by @xmath111 .",
    "the predicted radius for the assumed mass and measured period and redshift , is @xmath112 .",
    "in addition to the previous applications , our results concerning the maximum angular velocity , can be applied to millisecond pulsars .",
    "it is plausible to assume that for millisecond pulsars , the measured angular velocity is very close to the maximum angular velocity . with this in mind , it is possible to predict a value for @xmath3 using equation ( [ omax2 ] ) , and a unique value for the radius using ( [ r ] ) or ( [ r2 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath113 is a decreasing function , the predicted @xmath3 is actually a maximum bound , and if the `` preferred '' radius for the neutron star is @xmath58 , the predicted radius can be thought of as a maximum bound also .",
    "here we present a table with predicted redshifts and radii for several fast millisecond pulsars . +    [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the table in can be inferred that for fast millisecond pulsars the radii are consistent with standard neutron star models @xcite . however , for the slower millisecond pulsars , the maximum radius is slightly greater than what is predicted by most neutron star models , which implies that these neutron stars are probably not rotating exactly at their maximum angular velocity . in such a case",
    "the given radii should be interpreted as an upper bound which comes indeed close to the upper limit discussed in the introduction . using equation ( [ mass - shedd ] ) and assuming a mass of @xmath114 the corresponding radius for psr b1937 + 21 turns out to be @xmath115 @xcite , @xmath116 less than our result .",
    "for the slower millisecond pulsars , our results also predict slightly larger radii than those obtained by equation ( [ mass - shedd ] ) .",
    "we have shown that the gravitational redshift in conjunction with global results from theoretical models can yield valuable information on the properties of rotating compact objects . even though the determination of the radius in the presence of rotation is not a unique prescription , for relatively small angular velocities we can always opt for the lower result of the radius determination . with increasing angular velocity , a narrow range of possible radii",
    "can be defined .",
    "alternatively , assuming that the angular velocity of the fast spinning neutron stars is close to its maximal value , we can either obtain a unique radius or an upper bound . the maximal angular velocity derived in text",
    "does not depend on the radius directly , but on the redshift which makes direct contact with existing or future observations .",
    "the absolute limit on @xmath1 ( [ omax1 ] ) does not even depend on the redshift .",
    "it is satisfying that both these bounds come close to the observed values for millisecond pulsar .",
    "this implies that nature reaches here it maximally possible value .",
    "another advantage of our approach is the confirmation of the emission angle of radiation in fast rotating neutron stars .",
    "the application of our results to existing objects clearly show that the method of using the gravitational redshift for rotating objects is effective .",
    "+ the important feature we would like to emphasize here is that we relate properties of rotating compact objects to measurable quantities such as the gravitational redshift and the angular velocity .",
    "this way , our approach is semi - empirical and independent of model details . +",
    "as discussed in section four , our analytical findings regarding the maximal angular velocity agree with results obtained after numerical calculations . in this way , both , the analytical and numerical approach , corroborate each other .      10 for a review see n. stergioulas , living .",

    "<S> when rotation is not taken into account , the measurement of the gravitational redshift can provide unique information about the compactness ( @xmath0 ) of the star . </S>",
    "<S> rotation alters the gravitational redshift rendering thereby a unique determination of the compactness parameter impossible . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it can be shown that by using some theoretical input , useful information on , say , the radii of compact rotating objects can still be extracted . moreover , by measuring the gravitational redshift one can infer the maximum angular velocity of the object . </S>",
    "<S> as it is well known , the minimum observed periods of rotation are found in millisecond pulsars . </S>",
    "<S> here we show that millisecond periods are actually a semi - theoretical limit that can be found by general relativistic arguments corresponding to the maximum angular velocity . </S>",
