    "the spontaneous - emission rate of an atom depends on its dielectric environment @xcite and in particular on the precise position of the atom if the medium is inhomogeneous @xcite .",
    "spontaneous emission can only be understood quantum mechanically , but the classical green function determines the emission rate . in particular , the emission rate is proportional to the imaginary part of the green tensor of the medium at the atomic position .",
    "the dipole - angle average of the emission rate is also known as the local optical density of states @xcite .    in order to study the influence of the medium on much more than just single - atom spontaneous - emission rates , in this paper a rather general multiple - scattering theory",
    "is set up .",
    "it is is based on ` macroscopic quantization ' theories of the electromagnetic field in inhomogeneous lossless dielectrics , see for example @xcite .",
    "microscopic treatments of ( macroscopically homogeneous ) dielectrics in quantum electrodynamics can be found in @xcite but will not be used here .",
    "an important result in the macroscopic theories is that photons can be defined as the elementary excitations of the true modes of the dielectric .",
    "corresponding mode functions are the ( classical ) harmonic solutions of the wave equation .    emission rates of an atom not only change due to the nonresonant dielectric environment , but also due to the presence of other atoms with the same transition frequency . as is known since the pioneering work by dicke @xcite , resonant atoms in each others neighborhood decay cooperatively . depending on the many - atom state ,",
    "the atoms decay faster than a single atom up till twice the single - atom rate ( superradiance ) or decay slower or not at all ( subradiance ) .",
    "lifetime changes of individual atom pairs as a function of their distance were measured only recently @xcite ; for two @xmath0 ions that emit at a wavelength of @xmath1 and for well - defined separations @xmath2 around @xmath3 , subradiant and superradiant lifetime effects of less than @xmath4 were observed .",
    "superradiance occurs for the so - called dicke states that have a zero expectation value of the total dipole moment @xcite , but also for atomic product states with a nonzero dipole moment @xcite .",
    "superradiance also occurs for classical dipoles .",
    "it is a general phenomenon also exhibited in acoustics by nearby identical tuning forks , or by strings in a piano @xcite .",
    "these systems have in common that the atoms ( or oscillators ) interact with a field that is influenced by the radiation reactions of all nearby atoms together .",
    "cooperative effects of resonant atoms will be influenced by their dielectric environment . in this paper",
    "the influence of a nondispersive and lossless inhomogeneous dielectric on embedded or nearby resonant atoms is studied .",
    "quantum theory is used both to describe the light and the atoms .",
    "as we focus on the effects of the inhomogeneous dielectric , the atoms are modelled simply as quantum harmonic oscillators in their ground states or first excited states , with fixed dipole orientations . to be sure ,",
    "in choosing this model we neglect optical saturation effects of the atoms .",
    "the dielectric is described macroscopically in terms of a real - valued relative dielectric function @xmath5 , the form of which will be left arbitrary .",
    "the precise measurement of two - atom superradiance in free space as a function of distance is a fundamental test for quantum electrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the effects calculated here are a test for macroscopic quantization theories for inhomogeneous dielectrics .    like single - atom emission @xcite",
    ", two - atom superradiance will be modified in the close vicinity of a mirror , or inside an optical cavity @xcite .",
    "strong modifications of superradiance are also predicted for photonic crystals , dielectrics with periodic refractive - index variations on the scale of the wavelength of light @xcite .",
    "large effects are predicted in the so - called isotropic model for a photonic crystal , which is really a toy model in the sense that all local an orientational inhomogeneities of the electromagnetic field are neglected . in a real photonic crystal",
    ", two - atom superradiance is expected to sensitively depend on the coordinates of both atoms .",
    "the present formalism is valid for an arbitrary real dielectric function and encompasses the interesting special cases just mentioned .",
    "atoms that exhibit superradiance interact strongly enough to share and exchange the optical excitation before emission .",
    "the more common and better studied situation for resonant atoms in a dielectric is that the interaction between the atoms is weak compared to interactions with baths that the individual atoms have .",
    "then the optical excitations are transferred irreversibly from donor to acceptor atoms via a process called ` resonance energy transfer ' , as described by f \" orster theory @xcite and its modern generalizations @xcite .",
    "resonance energy transfer is influenced by the dielectric environment .",
    "for example , calculations show that two - atom interactions can be strongly influenced by an optical microcavity @xcite , since the cavity modes with eigenfrequencies close or equal to the atomic transition frequency play a dominant role .",
    "indeed , experiments have shown that the interatomic ( dipole - dipole ) interaction is increased when the atoms are placed in a cavity at positions where resonant optical modes have their maxima @xcite . in another interesting experiment ,",
    "frster excitation transfer is found to scale linearly with the local optical density of states at the donor position @xcite .",
    "although we focus on superradiance , the formalism in the present work is quite general and can also be used as a quantum electrodynamical foundation for the study of energy transfer processes in inhomogeneous media .",
    "recent progress in this direction can be found in @xcite .    often in quantum optics",
    "an ` all - matter ' picture is employed , where the dynamics of the electromagnetic field is integrated out , for example in the optical bloch equations @xcite . here",
    "instead we treat spontaneous emission and superradiance in an ` all light ' picture , which is convenient when studying the effect of the dielectric .",
    "a multiple - scattering theory is set up in which the atoms show up both as sources and as scatterers of light .",
    "it is known that superradiance can be viewed as caused by multiple - scattering interactions @xcite .",
    "light scattered off a collection of atoms will show multi - atom resonances and cooperative effects , also due to multiple scattering . in quantum scattering theory",
    "such resonances appear as well and sometimes are called ` proximity resonances ' @xcite .",
    "the concept of a point scatterer proved very fruitful in the study of multiple - scattering of classical light in free space @xcite . here",
    ", the point - scattering formalism will be put to use in quantum optics of inhomogeneous dielectrics .",
    "multiple light scattering will be described in terms of green functions of the medium .",

    "<S> the dynamics of a collection of resonant atoms embedded inside an inhomogeneous nondispersive and lossless dielectric is described with a dipole hamiltonian that is based on a canonical quantization theory . </S>",
    "<S> the dielectric is described macroscopically by a position - dependent dielectric function and the atoms as microscopic harmonic oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> we identify and discuss the role of several types of green tensors that describe the spatio - temporal propagation of field operators . after integrating out the atomic degrees of freedom </S>",
    "<S> , a multiple - scattering formalism emerges in which an exact lippmann - schwinger equation for the electric field operator plays a central role . </S>",
    "<S> the equation describes atoms as point sources and point scatterers for light . </S>",
    "<S> first , single - atom properties are calculated such as position - dependent spontaneous - emission rates as well as differential cross sections for elastic scattering and for resonance fluorescence . secondly , multi - atom processes are studied . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the medium modifies both the resonant and the static parts of the dipole - dipole interactions . </S>",
    "<S> these interatomic interactions may cause the atoms to scatter and emit light cooperatively . unlike in free space , differences in position - dependent emission rates and radiative line shifts influence cooperative decay in the dielectric . as a generic example </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that near a partially reflecting plane there is a sharp transition from two - atom superradiance to single - atom emission as the atomic positions are varied . </S>"
