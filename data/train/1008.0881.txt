    "biological aggregations such as fish schools , bird flocks , bacterial colonies , and insect swarms @xcite have characteristic morphologies governed by the group members interactions with each other and with their environment .",
    "the _ endogenous _ interactions , _",
    "i.e. _ , those between individuals , often involve organisms reacting to each other in an attractive or repulsive manner @xcite when they sense each other either directly by sound , sight , smell or touch , or indirectly via chemicals , vibrations , or other signals .",
    "a typical modeling strategy is to treat each individual as a moving particle whose velocity is influenced by social ( interparticle ) attractive and repulsive forces @xcite . in contrast , the _ exogenous _ forces describe an individual s reaction to the environment , for instance a response to gravity , wind , a chemical source , a light source , a food source , or a predator .",
    "the superposition of endogenous and exogenous forces can lead to characteristic swarm shapes ; these equilibrium solutions are the subject of our present study .",
    "more specifically , our motivation is rooted in our previous modeling study of the swarming desert locust _",
    "schistocerca gregaria _ @xcite . in some parameter regimes of our model (",
    "presented momentarily ) , locusts self - organize into swarms with a peculiar morphology , namely a bubble - like shape containing a dense group of locusts on the ground and a flying group of locusts overhead ; see figure [ fig : locust](bc ) .",
    "the two are separated by an unoccupied gap . with wind",
    ", the swarm migrates with a rolling motion .",
    "locusts at the front of the swarm fly downwards and land on the ground .",
    "locusts on the ground , when overtaken by the flying swarm , take off and rejoin the flying group ; see figure [ fig : locust](cd ) .",
    "the presence of an unoccupied gap and the rolling motion are found in real locust swarms  @xcite . as we will show throughout this paper , features of swarms such as dense concentrations and disconnected components ( that is , the presence of gaps ) arise as properties of equilibria in a general model of swarming .",
    "the model of @xcite is    [ eq : locusts ] @xmath1    which describes @xmath2 interacting locusts with positions @xmath3 .",
    "the direction of locust swarm migration is strongly correlated with the direction of the wind @xcite and has little macroscopic motion in the transverse direction , so the model is two - dimensional , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath4 where the @xmath5 coordinate is aligned with the main current of the wind and @xmath6 is a vertical coordinate . as the velocity of each insect is simply a function of position ,",
    "the model neglects inertial forces .",
    "this so - called kinematic assumption is common in swarming models , and we discuss it further in section [ sec : discretemodel ] .",
    "the first term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : locusts ] ) describes endogenous forces ; @xmath7 measures the force that locust @xmath8 exerts on locust @xmath9 .",
    "the first term of @xmath7 describes attraction , which operates with strength @xmath10 over a length scale @xmath11 and is necessary for aggregation .",
    "the second term is repulsive , and operates more strongly and over a shorter length scale in order to prevent collisions .",
    "time and space are scaled so that the repulsive strength and length scale are unity .",
    "the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ eq : locusts ] ) describes gravity , acting downwards with strength @xmath12 .",
    "the last term describes advection of locusts in the direction of the wind with speed @xmath13 .",
    "furthermore , the model assumes a flat impenetrable ground . since locusts rest and feed while grounded , their motion in that state is negligible compared to their motion in the air .",
    "thus we add to ( [ eq : locusts ] ) the stipulation that grounded locusts whose vertical velocity is computed to be negative under ( [ eq : locusts ] ) remain stationary .",
    "as mentioned above , for some parameters , ( [ eq : locusts ] ) forms a bubble - like shape .",
    "this can occur even in the absence of wind , that is , when @xmath14 ; see figure [ fig : locust](b ) .",
    "the bubble is crucial , for it allows the swarm to roll in the presence of wind . as discussed in @xcite , states which lack a bubble in the absence of wind do not migrate in the presence of wind .",
    "conditions for bubble formation , even in the equilibrium state arising in the windless model , have not been determined ; we will investigate this problem .",
    "some swarming models adopt a discrete approach  as in our locust example above  because of the ready connection to biological observations .",
    "a further advantage is that simulation of discrete systems is straightforward , requiring only the integration of ordinary differential equations .",
    "however , since biological swarms contain many individuals , the resulting high - dimensional systems of differential equations can be difficult or impossible to analyze .",
    "furthermore , for especially large systems , computation , though straightforward , may become a bottleneck .",
    "continuum models are more amenable to analysis .",
    "one well - studied continuum model is that of @xcite , a partial integrodifferential equation model for a swarm population density @xmath15 in one spatial dimension : @xmath16 the density @xmath17 obeys a conservation equation , and @xmath18 is the velocity field , which is determined via convolution with the antisymmetric pairwise endogenous force @xmath19 , the one - dimensional analog of a social force like the one in ( [ eq : locusts ] ) .",
    "the general model ( [ eq : introeq ] ) displays at least three solution types as identified in  @xcite .",
    "populations may concentrate to a point , reach a finite steady state , or spread . in  @xcite , we identified conditions on the social interaction force @xmath19 for each behavior to occur .",
    "these conditions map out a `` phase diagram '' dividing parameter space into regions associated with each behavior .",
    "similar phase diagrams arise in a dynamic particle model @xcite and its continuum analog @xcite .",
    "models that break the antisymmetry of @xmath19 ( creating an asymmetric response of organisms to each other ) display more complicated phenomena , including traveling swarms @xcite .",
    "many studies have sought conditions under which the population concentrates to a point mass . in a one - dimensional domain ,",
    "collapse occurs when the force @xmath19 is finite and attractive at short distances @xcite .",
    "the analogous condition in higher dimensions also leads to collapse @xcite .",
    "one may also consider the case when the velocity includes an additional term describing an exogenous force , @xmath20 in this case , equilibrium solutions consisting of sums of point - masses can be linearly and nonlinearly stable , even for social forces @xmath19 that are repulsive at short distances @xcite .",
    "these results naturally lead to the question of whether a solution can be continued past the time at which a mass concentrates . early work on a particular generalization of ( [ eq : introeq ] )",
    "suggests the answer is yes @xcite . for ( [ eq : introeq ] ) itself in arbitrary dimension",
    ", there is an existence theory beyond the time of concentration @xcite .",
    "some of the concentration solutions mentioned above are equilibrium solutions",
    ". however , there may be classical equilibria as well .",
    "for most purely attractive @xmath19 , the only classical steady states are constant in space , as shown via a variational formulation of the steady state problem @xcite",
    ". however , these solutions are non - biological , as they contain infinite mass . there",
    "do exist attractive - repulsive @xmath19 which give rise to compactly - supported classical steady states of finite mass .",
    "for instance , in simulations of ( [ eq : introeq ] ) , we found classical steady state solutions consisting of compactly supported swarms with jump discontinuities at the edges of the support @xcite . in our current work , we will find equilibria that contain both classical and nonclassical components .",
    "many of the results reviewed above were obtained by exploiting the underlying gradient flow structure of ( [ eq : introeq2 ] ) .",
    "there exists an energy functional @xmath21 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_\\mathbb{r } \\int_\\mathbb{r } \\rho(x ) \\rho(y ) q(x - y)\\,dx\\,dy + \\int_\\mathbb{r } f(x)\\rho(x)\\,dx,\\ ] ] which is minimized under the dynamics .",
    "this energy can be interpreted as the continuum analog of the summed pairwise energy of the corresponding discrete ( particle ) model @xcite .",
    "we will also exploit this energy to find equilibrium solutions and study their stability .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on equilibria of swarms and ask the following questions :    * what sorts of density distributions do swarming systems make ? are they classical or nonclassical ? * how are the final density distributions reached affected by endogenous interactions , exogenous forces , boundaries , and the interplay of these ? *",
    "how well can discrete and continuum swarming systems approximate each other ?    to answer these questions , we formulate a general mathematical framework for discrete , interacting swarm members in one spatial dimension , also subject to exogenous forces .",
    "we then derive an analogous continuum model and use variational methods to seek minimizers of its energy .",
    "this process involves solution of a fredholm integral equation for the density .",
    "for some choices of endogenous forces , we are able to find exact solutions . perhaps surprisingly , they are not always classical . in particular , they can involve @xmath0-function concentrations of mass at the domain boundary .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : formulation ] , we create the mathematical framework for our study , and derive conditions for a particular density distribution to be an equilibrium solution , and to be stable to various classes of perturbations .    in sections [ sec : repulsive ] and [ sec : morse ] ,",
    "we demonstrate different types of swarm equilibria via examples . in section",
    "[ sec : repulsive ] , we focus on purely repulsive endogenous interactions .",
    "we consider a bounded domain with no exogenous forces , a half - line subject to gravitational forces , and an unbounded domain subject to a quadratic exogenous potential , modeling attraction to a light , chemical , or nutrient source .",
    "for all three situations , we find exact solutions for swarm equilibria .",
    "for the first two examples , these equilibria consist of a density distribution that is classical in the interior of the domain , but contains @xmath0-functions at the boundaries . for the third example , the equilibrium is compactly supported with the density dropping discontinuously to zero at the edge of the support .",
    "for all three examples , we compare analytical solutions from the continuum framework to equilibria obtained from numerical simulation of the underlying discrete system . the two agree closely even for small numbers of discrete swarm members .",
    "section [ sec : morse ] is similar to section [ sec : repulsive ] , but we now consider the more complicated case of endogenous interactions that are repulsive on short length scales and attractive over longer ones ; such forces are typical for swarming biological organisms .    in section [ sec : locust - ground ] , we revisit locust swarms , focusing on their bubble - like morphology as described above , and on the significance of dimensionality . in a one - dimensional model corresponding to a vertical slice of a wide locust swarm under the influence of social interactions and gravity ,",
    "energy minimizers can reproduce concentrations of locusts on the ground and a group of locusts above the ground , but there can not be a separation between the two groups",
    ". however , a quasi - two - dimensional model accounting for the influence of the swarm s horizontal extent does , in contrast , have minimizers which qualitatively correspond to the biological bubble - like swarms .",
    "consider @xmath2 identical interacting particles ( swarm members ) in one spatial dimension with positions @xmath22 .",
    "assume that motion is governed by newton s law , so that acceleration is proportional to the sum of the drag and motive forces .",
    "we will focus on the case where the acceleration is negligible and the drag force is proportional to the velocity .",
    "this assumption is appropriate when drag forces dominate momentum , commonly known in fluid dynamics as the low reynolds number or stokes flow regime . in the swarming literature , the resulting models , which are first - order in time , are known as _",
    "kinematic models have been used in numerous studies of swarming and collective behavior , including @xcite ) .",
    "we now introduce a general model with both endogenous and exogenous forces , as with the locust model ( [ eq : locusts ] ) .",
    "the endogenous forces act between individuals and might include social attraction and repulsion ; see  @xcite for a discussion . for simplicity , we assume that the endogenous forces act in an additive , pairwise manner .",
    "we also assume that the forces are symmetric , that is , the force induced by particle @xmath9 on particle @xmath8 is the opposite of that induced by particle @xmath8 on particle @xmath9 .",
    "exogenous forces might include gravity , wind , and taxis towards light or nutrients .",
    "the governing equations take the form    [ eq : discretesystem ] @xmath23    eventually we will examine the governing equations for a continuum limit of the discrete problem . to this end , we have introduced a _ social mass _ @xmath24 which scales the strength of the endogenous forces so as to remain bounded for @xmath25 .",
    "@xmath26 is the total social mass of the ensemble .",
    "( [ eq : vee ] ) defines the velocity rule ; @xmath27 is the endogenous velocity one particle induces on another , and @xmath28 is the exogenous velocity . from our assumption of symmetry of endogenous forces , @xmath19 is odd and in most realistic situations is discontinuous at the origin .",
    "each force , @xmath28 and @xmath19 , can be written as the gradient of a potential under the relatively minor assumption of integrability .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , most of the specific models for mutual interaction forces proposed in the literature satisfy this requirement .",
    "many exogenous forces  including gravity and common forms of chemotaxis  do so as well . under this assumption , we rewrite ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) as a gradient flow , @xmath29 where the potential @xmath30 is    [ eq : discrete_gradient ] @xmath31    the double sum describes the endogenous forces and the single sum describes the exogenous forces . also , @xmath32 is the mutual interaction potential , which is even , and @xmath33 is the exogenous potential .",
    "the flow described by ( [ eq : discretegradient1 ] ) will evolve towards minimizers of the energy @xmath30 .    up to now",
    ", we have defined the problem on @xmath34 . in order to confine the problem to a particular domain @xmath35",
    ", one may use the artifice of letting the exogenous potential @xmath33 tend to infinity on the complement of @xmath35 .    while this discrete model is convenient from a modeling and simulation standpoint , it is difficult to analyze . presently , we will derive a continuum analog of ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) .",
    "this continuum model will allow us to derive equilibrium solutions and determine their stability via the calculus of variations and integral equation methods .      to derive a continuum model , we begin by describing our evolving ensemble of discrete particles with a density function @xmath15 equal to a sum of @xmath0-functions .",
    "( for brevity , we suppress the @xmath36 dependence of @xmath17 in the following discussion . )",
    "our approach here is similar to @xcite .",

    "that is , we require @xmath42 where @xmath43 by conservation of mass , the density obeys @xmath44 with no mass flux at the boundary .",
    "we now introduce an energy functional @xmath45 $ ] which is analogous to the discrete potential @xmath30 in ( [ eq : generic_potential ] ) : @xmath46 = \\frac{1}{2 } \\int_{{\\omega}}\\int_{{\\omega}}\\rho(x ) \\rho(y ) q(x - y)\\,dx\\,dy + \\int_{{\\omega}}f(x)\\rho(x)\\,dx.\\ ] ] this expression follows from the discrete potential , @xmath21 = m { { \\cal{w}}}(x_1,\\ldots , x_n),\\ ] ] remembering the @xmath0-function definition of the density ( [ eq : deltafuncs ] ) .",

    "a consequence of this boundary condition is that under some conditions , mass may concentrate at the boundary of the domain , and we will later see this manifest . since energy is dissipated , we conclude that stable equilibria correspond to minimizers of @xmath48 .",
    "imagine now that the energy ( [ eq : continuum_energy ] ) is defined for _ any _ density distribution @xmath17 , not just ensembles of @xmath0-functions .",
    "we will find minimizers for the continuous energy ( [ eq : continuum_energy ] ) and show that they approximate solutions to the discrete problem in the limit of large @xmath2 . to establish a correspondence between the two frameworks , consider a continuous distribution @xmath49 with total mass @xmath26 .",

    "the functions @xmath53 and @xmath56 are shown as the dotted red step function and the blue curve , respectively , in figure [ fig : delta_schematic](b ) .",
    "we may then differentiate to find an approximation @xmath49 , as shown in figure [ fig : delta_schematic](c ) .",
    "we use this correspondence in sections [ sec : repulsive ] through [ sec : locust - ground ] to compare analytical results for the continuum system ( [ eq : pde ] ) with numerical simulations of the discrete system ( [ eq : discretesystem ] ) .",
    "we close this subsection by reiterating why we have made a correspondence between the discrete and continuum systems .",
    "we use the continuous framework to find equilibrium solutions analytically via variational and integral equation methods .",
