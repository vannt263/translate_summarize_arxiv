    "rapidly oscillating ap ( roap ) stars are a subgroup of the cp2 stars , which oscillate with non - radial , high overtone , low order acoustic @xmath2-modes with the axis of oscillation aligned with the axis of the magnetic field ( kurtz 1982 ) .",
    "a still open question is concerned with the excitation mechanism for roap stars and other physical parameters which distinguish them from non - pulsating cp stars .",
    "six emmi echelle spectra were obtained by g.mathys with the ntt at eso in june 1992 .",
    "two different cross - disperser grisms covered the entire spectral range from 4200 to 8100 .",
    "the spectral resolution is about @xmath3=24000 , the typical signal - to - noise ratio per pixel is about 200 in the continuum .",
    "all reductions of the observations to continuous spectra and the normalization to the continuum were done within the echelle package of iraf . all calculations to determine the basic stellar parameters and the abundance patterns are based on the abundance analysis procedure aap ( gelbmann 1995 ) .",
    "an abundance analysis was carried out for the three roap stars hd166473 , hd203932 ( gelbmann et al .",

    "in addition , abundance analyses of two @xmath0bootis stars with effective temperatures comparable to the roap stars have been carried out within the vienna working group with the same spectrum synthesis toolkit ( heiter 1996 ) .",
    "the effective temperature range of all six roap stars spectroscopically investigated so far varies from = 6750k to 8000k , corresponding to spectral types from f2 to a4 .",
    "the surface gravities range from = 4.2 to 4.4 which is consistent with @xmath6 values for a4 to f2 main sequence stars in a theoretical hr - diagram ( = 4.3 , gray 1992 ) .",
    "although the accuracy of the determination of  is rather poor , it is evident that roap stars are positioned on or close to the zams , they do not seem to be considerably evolved .",

    ". the elements c , n , and o are less abundant than the scaled solar abundances , their overall abundances relative to the sun vary from [ cno]=-0.8 to -0.2 with the mean at -0.5 .",

    "the total abundances vary from [ i.p.]=-0.8 to + 0.7 with the mean at + 0.2 , while the co abundances vary from [ co]=+1.0 to + 2.0 with the mean at + 1.6 .",
    "as the abundances of the iron peak elements increase , the abundances of the heavy elements increase as well . among normal a - type stars",

    "this study shows that roap stars have similar abundances for up to 38 elements identified in the sample .",
    "these abundances are being used to compute stellar atmosphere models based on individual opacities . within the significantly smaller number of analyzed elements in the literature ,",
    "a comparison to non - roap stars do not reveal large abundance differences .",
    "the derived fundamental stellar parameters and abundances allow to locate the stars in the hr - diagram and provide important boundary values for pulsation models .",
    "stellar structure and evolutionary parameters can be derived from such models .",
    "a comparison of the iron peak abundances in the six roap stars shows an unexpected relation between effective temperature and metallicity .",
    "fig.[relation ] shows this tendency for the total metallicity of all iron peak elements  versus the spectroscopically derived effective temperature .",
    "however , since all stellar parameters  including also effective temperature  are determined mainly with iron lines , it is not clear whether this tendency is astrophysically significant or an artifact due to the applied analyzing algorithm . the derived stellar parameters and abundances are resulting from optimization routines .",
    "inadequate model atmospheres , limited signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra , errors in atomic parameters and problems in defining the continuum can result in fairly large errors .",
