    "the improvements in accuracy and spatial resolution of modern spectropolarimeters have led to a new concept of quiet sun magnetism .",
    "it has been shown , for example , that quiet sun magnetic fields have strengths from zero to @xmath4  kg and that their evolution is closely related to the granular plasma motions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    however , the formation and disappearance of magnetic concentrations in the quiet sun are not yet well understood , mainly because of the difficulty of obtaining time sequences of polarization measurements over large fields - of - view ( fov ) .",
    "the recent upgrade of the interferometric bidimensional spectrometer ( ibis ; * ? ? ? * ) to a vector polarimeter makes it ideally suited to study these processes with high spatial , spectral and temporal resolution .",
    "here we analyze ibis polarimetric measurements showing the temporal evolution of kg fields associated with g - band bright points ( bps ) as these interact with the photospheric plasma .",
    "our aim is to improve the current knowledge about bp evolution in relation to magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "we focus on poorly known processes like the coalescence , fragmentation and cancellation of g - band bps .",
    "this study exploits the physical parameters derived from both the observed profiles and the inversion results .        .",

    "the observations were taken with ibis at the nso / dunn solar telescope on november 21 , 2006 from 16:24 ut to 17:17 ut . the dataset consists of @xmath5 scans of the 630.15  nm and 630.25  nm lines with @xmath6 seconds cadence , obtained at disk centre .",
    "the two spectral lines are sampled with a total of @xmath7 wavelengths ( fwhm  @xmath8  pm ) on an equidistant grid of @xmath9  pm skipping the telluric line in between the two lines , but sampling the o@xmath10 630.28  nm which allows to set the absolute wavelength scale .    in spectropolarimetric mode ,",
    "the incoming light to ibis is modulated by a pair of nematic liquid crystal variable retarders placed in a collimated beam in front of the field stop of the instrument .",
    "the light is analyzed by a beam splitter in front of the detector , imaging two orthogonal states onto the same chip thus allowing for dual - beam spectropolarimetry .",
    "the modulation is in such a way that at each wavelength position six modulation states @xmath11 ( and its orthogonal states @xmath12 ) are detected with the following temporal scheme : @xmath13 $ ] .",
    "the pixel scale of the spectropolarimetric images is @xmath14 , while the integration time per modulation state and wavelength was @xmath15  ms . for each narrow - band filtergram , a simultaneous broad - band ( @xmath16  nm )",
    "counterpart was acquired , imaging the same fov with the same exposure time .",
    "furthermore , g - band filtergrams ( @xmath17  nm ) with approximately the same fov , but smaller pixel scale ( @xmath18 ) were taken with an exposure time of @xmath19  ms . the seeing during the acquisition run was excellent and stable , allowing the adaptive optics system @xcite to achieve near diffraction - limited performance .",
    "the broad - band and g - band images have been restored via multi - frame blind deconvolution ( mfbd ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to further reduce the seeing degradation and obtain a homogeneous resolution in the whole @xmath20 fov .",
    "the global and local shifts necessary to align and destretch the broad - band images with respect to the mfbd restored broadband images have been computed and applied onto the spectropolarimetric images .",
    "this process reduces the seeing - induced crosstalk and makes the spatial resolution of the whole spectropolarimetric scan comparable with that of the individual narrow - band filtergrams .",
    "the dataset was then corrected for the systematic wavelength shift across the fov @xcite caused by the collimated mounting of the fabry - perots and for instrumental polarization introduced by the telescope and the polarimeter itself . the average noise level for stokes @xmath1 has been measured to be @xmath21 in units of the continuum intensity .",
    "the g - band observations are aligned with the broad - band images by using grid line targets .",
    "we then registered the different scans via a correlation procedure to eliminate residual global shifts due to tracking inaccuracies .",
    "we estimate the longitudinal magnetic flux density applying the centre - of - gravity method ( cog , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to the observed stokes @xmath1 profiles of the 630.15  nm line .",
    "unlike the classical magnetograph formula , the cog technique does not suffer from saturation effects in the kg regime .    to determine the intrinsic field strengths and magnetic filling factors associated with the g - band bps we perform an inversion of the stokes @xmath3 and @xmath1 profiles of the two lines with the sir code @xcite .",
    "we defer the interpretation of the linear polarization to future work with a more specific analysis as recommended by @xcite .",
    "the inversion is based on two atmospheric components , one magnetized and the other field - free .",
    "the fractional area of the pixel occupied by the former ( the magnetic filling factor @xmath22 ) is a free parameter of the inversion .",
    "the temperature stratification of each component is modified with two nodes , using the stratification of the harvard smithsonian reference atmosphere @xcite as initial guess .",
    "the line - of - sight ( los ) velocities in the two components as well as the field strength in the magnetized component are assumed to be constant with height .",
    "the stray - light contamination is modeled by averaging the stokes @xmath3 spectra in a region of @xmath23 around the inverted profile .",
    "this average profile is added to the observed spectra weighted by a factor @xmath24 ; the stray - light factor distribution is in good agreement with @xcite with typical value of @xmath25 .",
    "the macroturbulence and microturbulence velocities are set to zero . in the inversion process",
    ", the finite spectral resolution of the instrument is taken into account using the spectral point spread function of ibis @xcite .    since",
    "our goal is to study the evolution of strong kg flux concentrations associated with g - band bps , we invert only those profiles whose stokes @xmath1 signals are above @xmath26 in both lines ; such regions always enclose g - band bps .",
    "a total of @xmath27 profiles meet this condition , corresponding to approximately @xmath28 of the whole fov at any step of the time sequence .",
    "this sequence of high - spectral and -spatial resolution observations allows us to study the coalescence , fragmentation and cancellation of small - scale magnetic structure .",
    "examples of these processes are identified by inspecting the mfbd - restored g - band time series taken as context data in addition to the spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "figures  [ fig1],[fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] exemplify each individual process with a selection of four g - band subfields ( @xmath29 ) ( first row ) , simultaneous and co - spatial maps of cog magnetic flux density ( second row ) and stokes @xmath1 profiles ( right plot ) averaged over a @xmath30 box centered on the strongest cog signal .",
    "the contour lines overlaid on the magnetic flux density delimit kg field regions as indicated by the inversion of both lines .",
    "figures  [ fig1p ] and [ fig2p ] display plots of several quantities relevant to the processes shown in figures  [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] with full temporal resolution .",
    "we report the evolution of the los velocity for the magnetized component ( @xmath31 ) , the magnetic flux density ( @xmath32 ) and los field strength ( @xmath33 ) . @xmath31 and @xmath33 are outputs of the inversion analysis , while @xmath32 has been computed from both the inversion as @xmath34 ( dots ) and from the cog magnetic flux density ( triangles ) .",
    "the plotted quantities are averaged in the same @xmath30 box defined above .      in figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "a bp coalescence process is shown . in the first frame",
    "a diffuse magnetic signal can be recognized in the magnetic flux density images . in the g - band filtergram ,",
    "scattered , low - contrast bright features associated with the diffuse magnetic signals are recognizable .",
    "the photospheric advection field gathers the initially diffuse magnetic features in a small region of about @xmath35 ; simultaneously , in the same region , a bp emerges in the intergranular lane and kg fields are revealed by the inversion procedure ( stokes @xmath1 profiles emerge above @xmath26 ) .    in a time interval of about @xmath36  min , the magnetic flux density more than doubles ( figure  [ fig1p ] ) .",
    "simultaneously , the bp extends over @xmath35 in the intergranular lane .",
    "the los velocity is between @xmath37  km  s@xmath38 .",
    "the magnetic field strength remains nearly constant at about @xmath39  kg , while the magnetic flux density increases in good agreement with the same quantity calculated via cog method ( figure  [ fig1p ] ) .",
    "these results indicate that the increase of stokes @xmath1 amplitude is due to the increase of the magnetic filling factor and not to an increase of the field strength ; the inversion analysis retrieves an increase of @xmath22 from about @xmath40 to about @xmath41 .",
    "a confirmation of this result comes from stokes @xmath1 amplitudes in figure  [ fig1 ] : since the beginning of the sequence , the stokes @xmath1 profiles of the two lines have comparable amplitudes , so the field is always in the kg regime .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the fragmentation of a bp . in a time interval of about @xmath42 minutes",
    ", a high - contrast bp is fragmented in many small - scale bright features that move all over an intergranular lane with a length of about @xmath43 .",
    "the stokes @xmath1 signals are reduced in this process , but the comparable stokes @xmath1 amplitudes of the two lines indicate again a kg regime .",
    "figure  [ fig2p ] shows that the magnetic field strength remains constant at about @xmath44  kg , while the smearing of the `` progenitor '' bp causes a decrease of the magnetic flux density from about @xmath45  g to about @xmath15  g. these results suggest that the magnetic filling factor is reduced by the action of the photospheric advection field ; in fact the inversion analysis retrieves a decrease of @xmath22 from about @xmath46 to about @xmath47 .",
    "the los velocity exhibits smaller values than in the bp coalescence case ; more specifically , it varies around @xmath48  km  s@xmath38 .",
    "the process we present in figure  [ fig3 ] shows the cancellation of opposite polarity bps converging over the same photospheric region .",
    "the photospheric advection field gathers together opposite polarity flux concentrations .",
    "the result is a rapid disappearance of the g - band bps and the complete cancellation of the magnetic signals .",
    "the whole process lasts about @xmath42  min . in the plot of figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we report 630.25  nm stokes @xmath1 profiles associated with both polarity bps . from the gradual reduction of the profile amplitudes",
    "we conclude that a continuous process is causing the disappearance of the circular polarization signals .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite presented analyses of events in which the amplification of stokes @xmath1 signal was found to be simultaneous to the appearance of bright features in continuum and broad band images , respectively .",
    "@xcite performed an inversion of both 630  nm lines and measured an increase of the magnetic field strength associated with very strong redshifts ( up to @xmath49  km  s@xmath38 ) .",
    "the authors showed how stokes @xmath1 profiles evolved during the amplification process , changing from a sub - kg regime ( 630.15  nm stokes @xmath1 amplitude lower than the 630.25  nm one ) to a kg regime ( the stokes @xmath1 profiles of the two lines have comparable amplitudes ) .",
    "all these aspects are compatible with a convective collapse process . @xcite",
    "also observed an increase of the stokes @xmath1 signal in the 617.3  nm line and tentatively suggested the occurrence of a convective collapse .",
    "the approach adopted in the present work shows that the inversion of the observed profiles can help to interpret the physical process behind such observations .",
    "in particular , the increase of the filling factor reported in   [ bpcoal ]",
    "is induced by the action of the photospheric advection field . by the same token",
    ", the fragmentation event described in   [ bpfrag ] and associated with a decrease of the kg field filling factor , is produced by an opposite driving action of the advection field .",
    "furthermore , the more stable velocity in figure  [ fig1p ] suggests that the gathering of bright features in the coalescence process takes place in a steady downflow , while the variability of the velocity in figure  [ fig2p ] suggests that such a stability is lost during the fragmentation process . in both cases",
    ", the contrast of g - band bright points is strictly correlated to the fraction of atmosphere filled by kg fields , and therefore controlled by the advection field .",
    "different scenarios can explain the cancellation process .",
    "the first is the interaction , via successive magnetic reconnections , between opposite polarity field lines belonging to different magnetic bundles .",
    "a second possible scenario is the emergence of a u - shaped magnetic loop or the submergence of a @xmath50-shaped loop whose footpoints are observed as bps . in both scenarios , a certain amount of linear polarization is expected to be found between the circularly polarized regions , during the cancellation phase .",
    "contrary to this expectation , ibis was not able to detect any trace of linear polarization .",
    "higher polarimetric accuracy seems to be required to investigate this issue .",
    "we have presented results obtained from first observations with ibis in spectropolarimetric mode .",
    "they provide new information on three distinct and poorly known processes , namely the coalescence , fragmentation , and cancellation of flux concentrations in the photosphere of the quiet sun .",
    "our analysis highlights the importance of interpreting stokes profiles via inversion techniques to identify the physical mechanisms behind the processes under examination . in this way we have been able to associate the appearance ( dissolution ) of high - contrast g - band bps with a local increase ( decrease ) of the filling factor of photospheric kg fields induced by the photospheric advection field",
    "apparently , the field strength does not undergo significant variations in those processes ( figures  [ fig1p ] and [ fig2p ] ) .",
    "also , we have analyzed the cancellation of opposite - polarity g - band bps .",
    "our results add further data to the recent observation of interactions between granular flows and magnetic elements acquired with _ hinode _",
