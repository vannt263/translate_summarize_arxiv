    "with rising demand for bandwidth , several researchers around the world have measured and studied the occupancy of spectrum in different countries .",
    "these measurements suggest that except for the spectrum allocated to services like cellular technologies , and the industrial , scientific and medical ( ism ) bands , most of the allocated spectrum is heavily underutilized .",
    "the overall usage of the analyzed spectrum is as low as 4.54% in singapore @xcite , 6.2% in auckland @xcite , 17.4% in chicago @xcite and 22.57% in barcelona @xcite . among all the unutilized portions of the frequency spectrum , white spaces in the ultra high frequency ( uhf ) television ( tv ) bands have been of particular interest owing to the superior propagation characteristics as compared to the higher frequency bands .",
    "loosely speaking , the unutilized ( or underutilized ) tv channels collectively form the tv white spaces .",
    "the amount of available tv white space varies with location and time .",
    "tv white space estimation has been done in countries like the united states ( us ) , the united kingdom ( uk ) , europe , and japan  @xcite . in the indian context",
    ", single - day experiments at three locations in urban and sub - urban delhi have been performed  @xcite .",
    "the estimation of tv white space in the uhf band , based on spectrum allocation and tv transmitter parameters , is presented in this work .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are the following :    1 .",
    "for the first time , the empirical quantification of the available tv white space in the @xmath0-@xmath1mhz in india is presented .",
    "the quantification utilizes existing methods in the literature , namely pollution and protection viewpoints @xcite , and the technical specifications of the federal communications commission  @xcite .",
    "it is found that uhf tv band spectrum is heavily underutilized in india .",
    "2 .   motivated by underutilization of uhf tv band spectrum",
    ", a spatial reuse based channel allocation algorithm has been proposed for the existing indian tv transmitters operating in the 470 - 590 mhz band .",
    "the algorithm uses the least number of tv channels while ensuring no ( significant ) interference between transmitters operating in the same channel .",
    "it is observed that at least @xmath4 uhf tv band channels can be freed by this approach .",
    "the importance of the above results must be understood in the context of indian national frequency allocation plan ( nfap ) 2011 where a policy intent for the utilization of tv white spaces was made .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to estimate the amount of tv white spaces in india . besides , based on above results ,",
    "the tv band in india is underutilized and this situation is quite different than in the developed countries .",
    "the optimal mechanism(s ) for the use of tv white spaces in india can be _ different _ and it should be studied by further research .    _",

    "concluding remarks and directions for future work are discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "regulators fcc in the us and ofcom in the uk have allowed for secondary operations in the tv white spaces . under this provision , a secondary user can use the unutilized tv spectrum provided it does not cause harmful interference to the tv band users and it relinquishes the spectrum when a primary user ( such as tv transmitter ) starts operation . since the actual availability of tv white spaces varies both with location and time , operators of secondary services are interested in the amount of available white space .",
    "the available tv white space depends on regulations such as the protection margin to the primary user , maximum height above average terrain ( haat ) , transmission power of secondary user , and the separation distance .    as per fcc",
    ", a band can declared as unutilized if no primary signal is detected above a threshold of @xmath5dbm  @xcite . using the parameters of terrestrial tv towers ,",
    "tv white space availability in the us has been done in the literature  @xcite .",
    "the average number of channels available per user has been calculated using the pollution and protection viewpoints .",
    "these viewpoints are explained in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : methodology ] . using the pollution viewpoint into account , the average number of channels available per location increases with the allowable pollution level .",
    "this average number of available channels is maximum in the lower uhf band . in the protection viewpoint too , the average number of available channels at a location is maximum in the lower uhf band ( channels 14 - 51 of the us ) and this decreases as more and more constraints are applied . in uk , ofcom published a consultation providing details of cognitive access to tv white spaces in 2009  @xcite .",
    "the coverage maps and database of digital tv ( dtv ) transmitters can be used to develop a method for identification of the tv white space at any location within uk  @xcite . the tv white space availability in japan has also been studied in @xcite .",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that the amount of available tv white space in japan is larger than that in us and uk .",
    "however , this availability decreases with an increase in the separation distance .    to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "a comprehensive study of tv white space availability has not been done in india and is the focus of this work .",
    "as per the nfap 2011 @xcite , the spectrum in the frequency band @xmath0-@xmath6mhz is earmarked for fixed , mobile and broadcasting services .",
    "the nfap has allowed the digital broadcasting services to operate in the @xmath7-@xmath8mhz band .",
    "india is a part of the itu region  3 , and the @xmath8-@xmath9mhz band has been earmarked for international mobile telecommunications - advanced ( imt - a ) applications ( see footnote ind  38 of @xcite ) .",
    "hence , the digital tv broadcasting will operate in the frequency band from @xmath7mhz to @xmath8mhz .",
    "currently the tv transmitters operate only in the @xmath0-@xmath1mhz band in the uhf band .    in india , the sole terrestrial tv service provider is doordarshan which currently transmits in two channels in most parts across india .",
    "currently doordarshan has @xmath10 tv transmitters operating in india , out of which @xmath11 transmitters transmit in the vhf band - i ( @xmath12-@xmath13mhz comprising of two channels of @xmath14mhz each ) , @xmath15 transmitters operate in the vhf band - iii ( @xmath16-@xmath17mhz comprising of eight channels of @xmath11mhz each ) , and the remaining @xmath18 transmitters transmit in the uhf band - iv ( @xmath0-@xmath1mhz comprising of fifteen channels of @xmath11mhz each ) . in india ,",
    "a small number of transmitters operate in the uhf bands . as a result ,",
    "apart from @xmath11-@xmath19mhz band depending on the location , _ the uhf band is quite sparsely utilized in india _ !",
    "this observation will be made more precise in the next section .",
    "the quantification of tv white space in india will be addressed in this section .",
    "a computational tool has been developed that calculates the protection region and separation distance for each tower , and also the pollution region around the tower where a secondary device should not operate .",
    "currently , there are no tv white space regulations in india . the regulations of fcc ( us ) are borrowed for the estimation of tv white space in india .",
    "_ microphones are ignored in our computation due to lack of available information_. the input to the developed computational tool include the following parameters for all the tv transmitters :    1 .",
    "position of the tower ( latitude and longitude ) , 2 .",
    "transmission power of the tv transmitter , 3 .",
    "frequency of operation , 4 .",
    "height of the antenna , 5 .   and , terrain information of area surrounding the tower .",
    "the above parameters of all the tv towers operating in the uhf band - iv have been obtained from the terrestrial tv broadcaster doordarshan . out of 373 transmitters operating in the 470 - 590 mhz uhf band ( channel no .",
    "21 - 35 ) , doordarshan has provided data of 254 towers operating in the west , east , south and the north east zone .",
    "the tv transmitter information for the north zone is yet to be provided by doordarshan .",
    "comprehensive field strength measurements in india suggest that hata model is fairly accurate for propagation modeling  @xcite .",
    "the hata model will be used for path - loss calculations . using the tv transmitter information and the propagation model",
    ", we quantify the available tv white space in the uhf tv band by two methods .",
    "the first method utilizes the protection and pollution viewpoints while the second one utilizes technical specification made by the fcc .      the protection and pollution viewpoints used for calculating tv white space",
    "have been introduced by mishra and sahai  @xcite .",
    "their method is reviewed in this section and utilized in our work for obtaining tv white space availability ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] ) .      in the protection viewpoint ,",
    "when a secondary user operates , it must not cause any interference to the primary receivers in its vicinity .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : picture31 ]     protection radius , separation distance and the no - talk radius , width=240 ]    the protected area is defined using the following @xmath20 equations .",
    "let @xmath21 be the transmit power of primary in dbm , @xmath22 be the path - loss in db at a radial distance @xmath23 from the transmitter , @xmath24 be the thermal noise in dbm , and @xmath25 be the threshold @xmath20 in dbm .",
    "then , the protection radius @xmath26 is defined by the following @xmath20 equation , @xmath27 the regulator provides an additional margin ( @xmath28 ) to account for fading .",
    "the modified equation for @xmath26 is , @xmath29 the no - talk radius @xmath30 is defined as the distance from the transmitter up to which no secondary user can transmit .",
    "the difference @xmath31 is calculated such that if a secondary device transmits at a distance of @xmath31 from the tv band receiver located at @xmath32 , the @xmath20 at the tv band receiver within a radius @xmath33 does not fall below @xmath25 .",
    "the separation distance @xmath31 is then calculated such that @xmath34 where , @xmath35 is the secondary transmitter power in dbm .",
    "in addition to the co - channel considerations , a tv receiver tuned to a particular channel has a tolerance limit on the interference level in the adjacent bands . in the protection viewpoint , we consider that the protection radius in the adjacent channel is the same as in co - channel",
    ". however , the tv receiver can tolerate more adjacent channel interference than co - channel interference .",
    "therefore , a margin of @xmath36db more than co - channel fading margin @xmath28 ( set by the fcc regulations @xcite ) is provisioned for adjacent channel interference .",
    "the pollution viewpoint takes into consideration the fact that even though a region could be used by a secondary device , the interference at the secondary receiver due to the primary transmitter might be higher than the tolerable interference level of the secondary receiver .",
    "if @xmath37 is the interference tolerable by the secondary receiver , then @xmath38 is given by , @xmath39 similar to the protection viewpoint , there are adjacent channel conditions ( leakage of primary transmitter s power in the adjacent channel ) in the pollution viewpoint as well .",
    "it is assumed that the secondary device can tolerate up to @xmath40db of interference if it is operating in the adjacent channels .",
    "the tv white space available is the _ intersection _ of the white space determined from the pollution and protection viewpoints .",
    "the parameters used in our computations for calculating the available tv white space are given in table  [ i ] .",
    "& @xmath41db + & @xmath42db ( specified for 802.11 g systems ) + maximum tolerable interference ( @xmath37 ) by secondary ( adjacent channel ) & @xmath40db + noise in a @xmath11mhz band ( @xmath43 ) & @xmath44dbm +   + & @xmath45db + & @xmath46db ( specified by fcc ) + additional fading margin in adjacent channel & @xmath36db ( specified by fcc ) + required @xmath20 for primary receiver & @xmath40db + transmission power of secondary device & @xmath47dbm + haat of secondary device & @xmath48 m +    as an example , we consider the tv tower located at the sinhagad fort in pune .",
    "doordarshan informed us that the tower at sinhagad fort operates in the @xmath49-@xmath50mhz band ( channel  @xmath51 ) at a height of @xmath2 m and power of @xmath52kw ( @xmath53dbm ) . in the hata model used for path loss calculations ,",
    "pune has been considered as an urban city . using the pollution viewpoint , for a @xmath42db tolerable interference in channel @xmath51 ( @xmath49-@xmath50mhz )",
    ", the pollution radius for the tower is calculated to be @xmath54 km , and for a tolerable interference of @xmath40db in the adjacent channel , the pollution radius is @xmath55 km .",
    "what this means for a secondary device is that the interference level is more than the allowable limit ( @xmath42db above noise floor ) in a region of @xmath54 km in channel  @xmath51 and @xmath55 km in the adjacent channels around the tower .    from the protection viewpoint , if a fading margin of @xmath46db is provided , the protection and no - talk radius in channel  @xmath51 are @xmath56 km and @xmath57 km respectively .",
    "if we consider an additional fading margin of @xmath36db in the adjacent band , the no talk radius in the adjacent channel is @xmath56 km .",
    "this implies that if a secondary device operates within a distance of @xmath57 km in channel  @xmath51 and @xmath56 km in the adjacent channels , the primary user receiving on channel  @xmath51 will experience interference .",
    "the available white space is the intersection of the white space using the two viewpoints .",
    "thus , in pune , no secondary device can operate within a distance of @xmath54 km ( limit set by pollution viewpoint ) on channel  @xmath51 and @xmath56 km in the adjacent channels ( limit set by protection viewpoint ) around the tower at sinhagad fort .      in the fcc s definition of tv white space , the protection radius is same in the grade b contour ( @xmath58 ) @xcite . in the uhf band , @xmath58 is the distance from the tv tower where the field strength of the primary signal falls to @xmath59dbu .",
    "the required field strength is converted from from dbu to dbm using the following conversion formula @xcite , @xmath60 where , @xmath61 is transmit power in dbm , @xmath62 is the field strength in dbu , @xmath63 is the upper frequency - limit of the channel , and @xmath64 is the lower frequency - limit of the channel . to calculate the separation distance , i.e. distance beyond @xmath58 where no secondary device can transmit , the distance @xmath65 such that the signal from the secondary device at @xmath30 results in a signal level of @xmath66dbu at the tv receiver located at @xmath58 is calculated . for the tv transmitter at pune ,",
    "the no - talk radius , i.e. the distance from the tower beyond which a secondary device can use the channel is computed to be @xmath67 km .",
    "the results obtained by tv white space calculation methods of sec .  [ sec : methodology ] will be discussed in this section .      using the methodology described in sec .",
    "iii , the pollution and the no - talk radius are calculated for every tv tower in the four zones .",
    "each region is plotted as a circle around the tv tower .",
    "here it has been assumed that each tower has an omnidirectional antenna . the tv white space availability in the west , east , south and north - east zone using the pollution viewpoint",
