    "the high - momentum beamline can transport the primary proton beam ( 30 gev ) with the intensity of @xmath9-@xmath10/sec to the hadron hall , and it is a branch from the main proton beam of @xmath11 or @xmath12/sec . in addition , we can obtain unseparated secondary beams such as pions etc .",
    "the beam intensity of these secondaries depends on its species and momentum . a typical intensity for 10 gev / c ( 15 gev / c ) pions would be in the order of @xmath13/sec ( @xmath14/sec ) .",
    "because there is no approved proposal to study hadron spin physics at j - parc at this stage , we need to develop such possibilities . in this article , we first introduce particle - spin projects , and then we focus our discussions on high - energy hadron projects .",
    "particle - spin projects are intended to probe physics beyond the standard model . here ,",
    "we introduce three projects on ( 1 ) muon @xmath0 and electric dipole moment , ( 2 ) muon polarization in kaon decay , and ( 3 ) electric dipole moment of the neutron .",
    "there is a project to measure the anomalous magnetic moment ( @xmath0 ) and electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the muon at the mlf of j - parc.@xcite there is a long history of measurements on the muon @xmath0 .",
    "the muon magnetic moment is given by its spin and gyromagnetic ratio @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",

    "this deviation exists even if theoretical uncertainties , mainly from hadronic corrections , are taken into account , so that it could suggest new physics .",
    "therefore , it is important to improve the experimental measurement by an independent method .    under the static electric and magnetic fields , the muon spin precesses with the frequency @xmath28     - \\frac{e}{m }       \\left [ \\frac{\\eta}{2 }      \\left ( \\vec\\beta \\times \\vec b + \\frac{\\vec e}{c } \\right ) \\right ] \\equiv \\vec\\omega_a + \\vec\\omega_\\eta , \\label{eqn : g-2-frequency-1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the precession vector due to the anomalous magnetic moment , and",
    "@xmath30 is the one due to the electric dipole moment . in the cern and bnl experiments ,",
    "the muon energy was chosen to terminate the contribution of the @xmath31 term , and the edm contribution @xmath30 is neglected . in the proposed j - parc experiment in fig.@xmath2[fig : g-2-edm ] , the electric field @xmath32 is terminated to give the precession frequency @xmath33 .",

    "the purpose of this experiment is to improve the current limit of @xmath0 to 0.1 ppm by a factor of five and the edm to @xmath34 e@xmath24 cm by a factor of two orders of magnitude than the current limit .",
    "r&d is in progress for significant technological developments to start this experiment within 2010s.@xcite      there is a project to investigate time - reversal violation by the transverse muon polarization @xmath35 in kaon decay @xmath36 at j - parc.@xcite it is called trek ( time - reversal violation experiment with kaons ) experiment .",
    "this polarization could probe a signature beyond the standard model because the standard - model contributions from higher - order effects are considered to less than @xmath37 .",
    "the most recent measurement was done by the kek - e246 experiment and it was @xmath38 , which is consistent with no t - violation .",
    "new - physics models suggest that the polarization value should be as large as @xmath39 , which is just below the kek - e246 limit .",
    "therefore , it is valuable to measure the polarization more accurately to provide a clue for new physics . in the proposed j - parc experiment ,",
    "background reduction will be done by improved detector , especially the upgrade of polarimeter and magnet .",
    "the resulting error is expected to be @xmath40 . in the beginning low - intensity period of j - parc ,",
    "the collaboration proposed to start another experiment e36 on the decay ratio @xmath41 to test lepton universality by using a sub - system of the trek experiment.@xcite      ultracold neutrons ( ucn ) are used for measurements of fundamental physics quantities , and new generation ucn sources are under developments for experiments at facilities including j - parc.@xcite in particular , the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) should be able to probe new physics .",
    "for example , the supersymmetric model indicates that the nedm is of the order of @xmath42 e@xmath24 cm , which is just below the limit @xmath43 e@xmath24 cm obtained by a grenoble experiment .",
    "since the limit is constrained by the statistical error , efforts have been made to increase the ucn density , as well as efforts to reduce the systematic error .",
    "spallation ucn sources are considered for the nedm measurement at j - parc . due to the increase of the proton - beam power to 20 kw",
    ", the density is expected to become @xmath44-@xmath45 ucn/@xmath46 , whereas it was 0.7 ucn/@xmath46 in the grenoble experiment .",
    "with the new ucn sources together with the intense proton beam , much improvement will be made for the upper bound of the nedm into the region of @xmath47 e@xmath24 cm . at j - parc ,",

    ", the @xmath53 asymmetry should be very small .",
    "experimentally , the difference was suggested by the violation of the gottfried sum rule,@xcite and it was confirmed explicitly by the fermilab - e866 measurements in fig . [ fig : ub - db ] .",
    "however , there is a peculiar tendency of @xmath54 as @xmath48 becomes larger , which is difficult to be understood theoretically .",
    "the e906/seaquest experiment at fermilab is in progress for dimuon experiments to test this tendency , and it could be continued at j - parc .",
    "measurements of antiquark distributions in nuclei are also interesting .",
    "the fermilab drell - yan measurements showed that nuclear modifications of the antiquark distributions are very small at @xmath55 , which is in contradiction to the conventional pion - excess contribution .",
    "it is important to confirm this result by an independent experiment and to extend the measured @xmath48 region for finding a physics mechanism of nuclear medium effects on the antiquark distributions .",
    "in addition , determination of parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) at large @xmath48 is valuable for precisely calculating other high - energy reactions , for example , high-@xmath56 jet and hadron production cross sections at lhc .",
    "r0.36        generalized parton distributions ( gpds ) are key quantities for studying three - dimensional structure of hadrons , and hence to clarify the origin of the nucleon spin including partonic orbital - angular - momentum contributions.@xcite they are measured typically in deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpd-1 ] . however , there are possibilities to investigate them at hadron facilities like j - parc .",

    "become usual pdfs : @xmath76 .",
    "next , their first moments are the dirac and pauli form factors of the nucleon : @xmath77 , @xmath78 .",

    ", we expect that the origin of nucleon spin will be clarified by including the orbital - angular - momentum contributions .",
    "the gpds contain information on the longitudinal momentum distributions and transverse structure as the form factors , so that they are appropriate quantities for understanding the three - dimensional structure of hadrons .",
    "the gpds can be measured by the virtual compton scattering in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpd-1 ] at lepton facilities .",
    "however , they can be measured also at hadron facilities such as j - parc and gsi - fair , and examples are explained in the following subsections .",
    "r0.38        the unseparated hadron beam , which is essentially the pion beam , will become available at the high - momentum beamline of j - parc , so the exclusive drell - yan process is a possible future project at j - parc . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ex - dy ] , the exclusive dimuon process @xmath81 is shown.@xcite the process probes the nucleonic gpds if @xmath82 is the nucleon , whereas it is related to the transition gpds for @xmath83 .",
    "the cross section contains not only the gpds but also the pion distribution amplitude .",
    "although there are models for this quantity such as the asymptotic form or the chernyak - zhitnitsky type , the pion part is rather well studied and tested experimentally by the @xmath84 transition of belle and babar .",
    "using such studies for constraining the pion distribution amplitude , we should be able to obtain information on the gpds by the exclusive drell - yan process .",
    "using the high - energy proton beam , we could investigate the gpds at hadron facilities by using exclusive hadron - production reactions @xmath85 such as @xmath86 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gpd - hadron].@xcite the gpd has three kinematical regions , ( 1 ) @xmath87 , ( 2 ) @xmath88 , ( 3 ) @xmath89 , as shown in fig .",

    "the intermediate region ( 2 ) indicates an emission of quark with momentum fraction @xmath90 with an emission of antiquark with momentum fraction @xmath91 .",
    "the regions ( 1 ) and ( 3 ) are called as dglap ( dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ) regions , and ( 2 ) is called the erbl ( efremov - radyushkin - brodsky - lepage ) region . if the hadrons @xmath3 and @xmath52 have large and nearly opposite transverse momenta and a large invariant energy , so that an intermediate exchange could be considered as a @xmath92 state",
    ". then , the @xmath92 attached to the nucleon is expressed by the gpds in a special kinematical region of the erbl which is in the middle of three regions of fig .",
    "[ fig : gpd - kinematics ] .",
    "this method of measuring the gpds is complementary to the virtual compton scattering in the sense that the specific erbl region is investigated in the medium @xmath48 region due to the j - parc energy of 30 gev .              in order to understand the origin of nucleon spin including orbital angular momenta ,",
    "it becomes necessary to understand the three - dimensional structure of the nucleon .",
    "the momentum distribution along the motion of the nucleon is the longitudinal parton distribution function , and the transverse distribution plays a role of form factor at given @xmath48 .",
    "the inclusive drell - yan ( @xmath93 ) measurements can probe transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) polarized parton distributions , so called boer - mulders ( bm ) functions , by observing violation of the lam - tung relation in the cross sections.@xcite the bm functions indicate transversely - polarized quark distributions in the unpolarized nucleon .    other interesting tmd distributions are the sivers functions , which indicate unpolarized quark distributions in the transversely - polarized nucleon .",
    "for example , they appear in single spin asymmetries of hadron - production processes @xmath94 .",

    "the twist-2 structure functions are @xmath97 and @xmath98 , and they are expressed in terms of the tensor - polarized quark distributions @xmath101 .",
    "the @xmath97 was first measured by the hermes collaboration ; however , the detail of @xmath48 dependence is not clear and there is no accurate data at medium and large @xmath48 .",
    "the jlab @xmath97 proposal was approved and its measurement will start in a few years .",
    "the hermes data indicated the violation of the sum rule @xmath102,@xcite which suggests the existence of finite tensor polarization in antiquark distributions .",
    "this finite @xmath103 can be directly measured at hadron facilities by drell - yan processes with tensor - polarized deuteron ( @xmath104).@xcite we note that the polarized - proton beam is not needed for this experiment .",
    "this experiment is complementary to the hermes and jlab measurements of @xmath97 in the sense that the antiquark tensor polarization can be measured specifically .",
    "the experiment will clarify an exotic dynamical aspect of the deuteron in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom , which can not be done in low - energy measurements .",
    "r0.30        the origin of the nucleon spin is one of unsolved issues in hadron physics ; however , there is another mysterious experimental result in elastic spin symmetries .",
    "for example , measurements indicated that the single - spin asymmetry in @xmath105 increases as @xmath106 becomes larger at ags in fig .",
    "[ fig : elasic - spin].@xcite according to perturbative qcd , the asymmetry has to vanish at @xmath107 .",
    "because the data are taken up to @xmath108 gev@xmath109 , nonperturbative physics might have contributed to the finite asymmetry .",
    "considering the peculiar feature of the ags data , we need to confirm the experimental measurements by an independent facility such as j - parc before discussing possible physics mechanism .",
    "however , rather than a mere confirmation , innovative methods should be developed , such as by changing targets and by considering angular distributions in order to provide clear evidences for theorists to understand the mechanism .",
    "r0.45        it is technically possible to polarize the primary proton beam at j - parc.@xcite however , it requires a major update of the facility , we need to propose significant projects which are worth for the investment . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ub - db ] , j - parc could measure structure functions in the medium-@xmath48 region @xmath110 , whereas rhic probes a smaller-@xmath48 region ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "in order to determine all the partonic contributions to the nucleon spin , the polarized pdfs need to be precisely understood from small @xmath48 to large @xmath48 , namely from the rhic region to the j - parc one .",
    "therefore , it is a complementary facility to rhic and other high - energy accelerators . although longitudinally - polarized pdfs become clearer recently by various hadron and lepton reactions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : polpdfs ] , their flavor decomposition and gluon distribution are not obvious yet .",
    "if the proton beam is polarized with the designed energy 50 gev , the j - parc facility could significantly contribute to the clarification of the origin of the nucleon spin .",
    "in addition , there is new transverse spin physics , such as twist - two transversity distributions , by measuring double spin asymmetries of drell - yan processes with transversely polarized protons .",
    "the quark transversity distributions are unique in the sense that they do not couple to the gluon polarization due to their chiral - odd property .",
    "they are very different from the longitudinally - polarized pdfs .",
    "the transversity distributions can be measured at medium @xmath48 with the polarized proton beam at j - parc .",
    "a wide range of spin projects are possible in particle and nuclear physics at j - parc . as the particle - physics topics , we introduced muon @xmath0 , muon and neutron electric dipole moments , and time - reversal violation experiment in a kaon decay .",
    "they could probe physics beyond the standard model by precision measurements with the high - intensity advantage of the j - parc facility , and the measurements should shed light on new physics direction . in hadron spin physics , the studies of gpds and tmds should clarify the origin of the nucleon spin and also the three - dimensional structure of the nucleon including the transverse structure . in particular , the high - momentum beamline will be ready soon , and it can be used for various topics on high - energy hadron spin physics .",
