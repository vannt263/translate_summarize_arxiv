    "@xcite . a comprehensive review can be found in the textbook by weiss @xcite__. _ _    in the above context relatively little attention has been paid to effects arising from the coupling to different system variables .",
    "the system variable which couples to the heat bath is most often assumed to be the position _ q_. in the sequel we refer to this model as the _ _ q__oscillator .",
    "the choice of @xmath0 as the coupling variable was favoured in ref .",
    "there it was argued that a complex dissipative environment can be modelled by a bath of harmonic oscillators , with the couplings parameters chosen to yield a langevin equation for the @xmath0 variable in the semiclassical limit .",
    "it was shown later @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "kohl04 ) that , in a superconducting josepshon juntion , the oscillator bath model can be derived microscopically from the coupling of the phase variable to the quasiparticle bath , with the phase playing the role of position . at that time",
    "the possibility of having a second bath coupled to the momentum @xmath1 variable was ruled out .",
    "however , in a superconducting weak link , the electromagnetic field couples to the relative number variable , which in the above scheme plays the role of momentum @xcite .",
    "if the coupling to the phase is neglected , the semiclassical behavior of the particle number is governed by an abraham  lorentz equation kohl04,jack75 .",
    "the coupling to the momentum has been also been considered by leggett @xcite and by cuccoli _",
    "a systematic study of the combined role of the electromagnetic and quasiparticle fields is presented in ref .",
    "thus josephson junctions provide a scenario where the distinction between the different baths and their different coupling mechanisms becomes imperious .",
    "our study has also been motivated by the work of castro neto , novais and coworkers @xcite . to investigate the problem of a spin @xmath2 impurity in an antiferromagnetic environment",
    ", they studied a generalized spin ",
    "boson problem using renormalization group techniques .",
    "the localized spin couples with two components to the environment .",
    "they found a crossover from incoherent to coherent transitions in the spin correlation functions in certain parameter ranges .",
    "there the term _ quantum frustration _ was coined , which refers to the reduction of the effective interaction with the environment due to the non  commutativity of the coupled operators . in this article , we argue that a harmonic oscillator coupled through position and momentum to two independent baths is a suitable representation of a large spin impurity in a ferromagnetic system .",
    "we find a weaker cancellation of the effects of the two baths .",
    "since that situation corresponds to a large ( quasiclassical ) spin , we have referred to this weaker form of frustration as _ quasiclassical frustration _",

    "we wish to investigate systematically the scenario where a particle couples through its position and momentum to two baths , which are independent but have the same temperature . as a paradigmatic system",
    "we choose a harmonic oscillator .",
    "this choice is motivated not only by mathematical convenience .",
    "a more fundamental reason is that the symmetrical roles played by position and momentum makes the harmonic oscillator the natural ground to study the difference and the interplay ( when both are present ) between position and momentum coupling .",
    "an explanatory comment is in order .",
    "as is well known , a coupling to @xmath0 can be converted into a coupling to @xmath1 through a suitable canonical transformation .",
    "however , the two representations bear an important difference . only in one of them",
    "is it possible to represent the system  bath interaction as the coupling of the quantum variable to a system of _ otherwise independent _ oscillators .",
    "a characteristic example is provided by a particle of charge @xmath3 in an electromagnetic field , where a velocity  coupling model \" @xcite seems to apply .",
    "minimal coupling ( @xmath4 ) generates not only an interaction term @xmath5 but also a diamagnetic term @xmath6 which can be rightly interpreted as an interaction between the effective oscillators . a unitary transformation @xmath7 with @xmath8_{-}=i\\delta _ { ij}$ ] , acting on @xmath9 , removes the coupling @xmath5 .",
    "this happens at the expense of generating a coupling @xmath10 between the position and the electric field @xmath11 .",
    "importantly , in this new representation no quadratic field term is left , i.e. the charge couples to a set of independent photons .",
