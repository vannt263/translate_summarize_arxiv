    "as both components of @xmath292 are boundaries of similar tubular neighbourhoods , they can be identified , but the inner one , i.e. the boundary of @xmath678 has its orientation reversed .",

    "therefore , a fiber in @xmath679 is a meridian around @xmath64 , whereas a fiber in @xmath680 is a ( relatively small ) meridian around @xmath64 with the orientation reversed .",
