    "scattering of waves off objects is a central problem in physics @xcite . in recent years , it has gained additional interest in the context of cloaking @xcite , which aims at reducing or even eliminating scattering .",
    "amazingly , the deceptively simple case of continuum mechanics , which derives from newton s law and hooke s law , is among the most challenging cases .",
    "the challenge arises from the fact that waves in elastic media @xcite can have transverse , longitudinal , or mixed polarizations .",
    "polarization conversion can occur , too .",
    "in sharp contrast , electromagnetic waves are usually transverse , acoustic waves are longitudinal , and quantum - mechanical matter waves are scalar .",
    "in addition , cloaking in elastodynamics requires elasticity tensors with broken minor symmetry that were not usually considered previously . to test new concepts and design future experiments based on complex spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic elastic - material distributions , analytical solutions of the scattering problem are generally not available .",
    "thus , obtaining reliable numerical solutions is crucial .    in computational electromagnetism , two significant advances during the past 35 years",
    "are vector - mixed finite elements ( fes ) developed by ndlec @xcite and perfectly matched layers ( pmls ) introduced in 1994 by brenger @xcite and by chew and weedon @xcite .",
    "the latter have been extended to bianisotropic media by teixeira and chew @xcite .",
    "similar developments of pmls occurred in elastodynamics @xcite inspired by pmls in electromagnetics .",
    "clayton and engquist have paved the way for numerical investigation of scattering problems by explicitly considering an incident and scattered field @xcite using numerical formulations employing 3d finite element and/or boundary element methods .",
    "refinements of boundary element methods include the treatment of anisotropic unbounded media in elastodynamics , such as semi - infinite half - spaces , but this requires solving complex boundary integral equations @xcite",
    ". however , in the tracks of @xcite , a consistent infinitesimal finite - element cell method @xcite which can be seen as a finite element based boundary element method , allows using one row of elements to model infinite domains , with an asymptotic treatment in the radial direction that naturally fulfills the outgoing waves radiation conditions . in this way , one can handle complex heterogeneous anisotropic obstacles in unbounded elastic media .",
    "another type of problem in computational physics appeared in the past twenty years with the rapidly growing field of photonic and phononic crystals @xcite , and of course metamaterials @xcite .",
    "the computation of band diagrams requires the application of bloch - floquet theory , which is well developed in condensed matter physics , to electromagnetic and acoustic waves in periodic media .",
    "in fact , scattering problems have been studied for decades , mainly in the context of electromagnetism or acoustics . in these fields ,",
    "the decomposition of incident waves and scattered waves was comparably straightforward because the waves are either purely transverse or purely longitudinal in polarization .",
    "in this paper , we propose a rigorous and easily implementable path to solve problems of diffraction and scattering in the context of elastodynamics using a finite - element method ( fem ) .",
    "we first look at so - called adaptative perfectly matched layers that can efficiently attenuate elastodynamic waves within a deeply subwavelength region , without any reflection for all polarizations and incidence .",
    "we then move on to a general way to implement the scattering problem in elastodynamics in homogeneous linear non - dispersive media and how to compute the scattered field from an arbitrary object having continuity , stress - free or clamped boundary conditions at its surface .",
    "this combination brings us into a position to study the scattering of elastodynamic cloaks deduced from a geometric transform , leading to heterogeneous media of the cosserat type .",
    "although non - dispersive , such cosserat cloaks are amongst the most complex cases to solve in terms of diffraction and scattering , within the framework of linear elastodynamics .",
    "indeed , such cloaks are described by inhomogeneous and fully anisotropic non - symmetric rank-4 elasticity tensors ( and heterogeneous isotropic densities ) as required for both polarization conversion and coupling .",
    "( note that alternative routes to elastodynamic cloaking exist that preserve the symmetries of the elasticity tensor , such as using willis equations @xcite or transformed pre - stressed solids @xcite . )",
    "we finally investigate the numerical implementation of the cosserat cloak .",
    "in the absence of a source , we usually write the navier equations for the total displacement field @xmath0 for time - harmonic excitation as @xmath1   + \\rho\\omega^2{\\bf   u}={\\bf 0 } \\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the ( symmetric ) elasticity tensor , @xmath3 the mass density and @xmath4 the angular frequency of the wave .    before we can analyze the scattering of an arbitrary object , we need to be able to model scattering problems in unbounded domains . owing to their ability to strongly absorb incoming waves in a reflectionless manner , pmls help to model , within bounded domains , problems with open boundaries . implementing general pmls in elastodynamics",
    "is tricky .",
    "this problem becomes even more challenging in the quasi - static limit , where the wavelength tends to infinity and the entire radiated field is in the near field .",
    "thus , one needs sufficiently large pmls in order to enforce the decay of the elastic displacement - vector field down to zero on the outer boundary of the computational domain . here",
    ", we propose a type of adaptative elastic pmls , which are well suited for dealing with cases ranging from the quasi - static limit to high - frequency settings , as illustrated in fig .",
    "our approach is inspired by earlier work in electromagnetism @xcite and is obtained from transformational techniques @xcite applied to the navier equations ( [ nav1 ] ) , using the transformation @xmath5 the @xmath6 are the working complex coordinates and the stretches @xmath7 are either equal to 1 or to @xmath8 depending on the direction along which one would like to absorb the wave , in a given region , where @xmath9 is the complex number with @xmath10 the width of the pml region @xmath11 is a geometrical parameter that is automatically extracted for each region , whereas , the dimensionless pmls scaling factor @xmath12 , possibly incompassing a frequency dependence , can be modified at will in order to achieve the needed pmls efficiency ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this transformation is mapped onto the coefficients @xmath13 of the elasticity tensor @xmath14 and the mass - density tensor @xmath15 in the pml region @xcite .",
    "these coefficients have been implemented by us in the pde ( partial differential equation ) interface of the commercially available software comsol multiphysics which is used for all computations in this paper .    for a bounded 2d isotropic homogeneous elastic medium with lam coefficients @xmath16",
    "@xmath17 the @xmath18 nonvanishing elastic coefficients in the pml region read : @xmath19 and the density is as follows @xmath20    -component of the displacement field @xmath21 for a point source oscillating at an angular frequency @xmath22 rad.s@xmath23 and pmls scaling factor @xmath24 .",

    "let us now apply our scattered - field formalism combined with the pml to numerical studies of elastodynamic cloaking .",
    "first , we consider the ideal cosserat cloak . by construction",
    ", it should exhibit ideal cloaking .",
    "second , we consider a symmetrized version of the elasticity tensor .",
    "the motivation for the latter two is to reduce the complexity and the requirements of the cloak , if possible . indeed",
    ", homogenization theory shows it is only possible to achieve symmetric homogenized tensors with concentric layered media @xcite",
    ".    figures 3(a ) and 3(b ) show the scattered field and the total field , respectively , for an obstacle such as in fig.2(c ) and for an incident compression wave at an angular frequency of @xmath98 rad.@xmath59 .",
    "the cosserat cloak in fig .",
    "3 ( c ) shows a scattered field that is confined to the cloak and a recovery of the incident plane wave in fig .",
    "this is an explicit numerical demonstration for elastodynamic cloaking .",
    "cloaking of a similar quality has been obtained for many other frequencies for both incident compression and incident shear waves ( not depicted )",
    ". however , is the complicated non - symmetric cosserat - material distribution really necessary to obtain good elastic cloaking ? to investigate this question , we consider as the second example a symmetrized , i.e. , non - cosserat elasticity - tensor distribution .",
    "note that this symmetrization is not unique , but any chosen symmetrization must be physical in that all eigenvalues of the resulting elasticity tensor need to be real or complex valued with positive imaginary parts , at least for passive media . for a possible symmetrization ,",
    "the coefficients , again in polar coordinates , are given by @xmath99 with the dimensionless parameter @xmath100 the abbreviation @xmath101 has been given above .",
    "the corresponding numerical results shown in figs.3(e ) and 3(f ) do show a large qualitative improvement with respect to the obstacle case shown in figs.3(a ) and 3(b ) .",
    "however , we also find superimposed wiggles compared to the ideal case in figs.3(c ) and 3(d ) .",
    "these wiggles originate from shorter - wavelength shear - like partial waves , which are generated by the approximative cloak and which interfere with the incident compression - like wave .",
    "the cloaking quality can be quantified by applying measures such as those introduced in @xcite . upon applying such hard quality measures , due to the presence of the wiggles , we find hardly any improvement of the approximative cloak",
    "this statement holds true for angular frequencies @xmath4 ranging from @xmath102 to @xmath103 rad.s@xmath23 ( not depicted ) .",
    "other symmetrizations of the elasticity tensor lead to comparable results .",
    "this suggests that in order to achieve cloaking with a symmetric elasticity tensor , the density needs to be anisotropic .",
    "precisely , the real part of the vertical component of the displacement vector , @xmath26 , normalized to the amplitude of the incident wave , is shown on a false - color scale .",
    "all cloaks have an inner radius @xmath104 m and outer radius @xmath105 m. ]",
    "in conclusion , we have introduced general perfectly matched layers and a scattered - field formalism for elastodynamic waves following the navier equations .",
    "we have shown that the adaptative perfectly matched layers work all the way from the quasi - static regime to high frequencies .",
    "different types of boundary conditions have been discussed .",
    "this mathematical progress should be useful for many different mechanical problems .",
    "as an example , it has enabled us to analyze quantitatively the scattering reduction of elastodynamic cloaks .",
    "our numerical results indicate ideal cloaking for cosserat - type elasticity tensors that do not obey the minor symmetries  which is expected from the analytical construction  whereas approximative continuous symmetrized elasticity - tensor distributions lead to a rather poor cloaking quality .",
    "this shortcoming is connected to the fact that symmetric elasticity tensors can not simultaneously deal with incident compression and shear waves whenever the density is isotropic .",
    "it would thus be highly desirable to construct and realize cosserat mechanical metamaterials experimentally in the future .",
