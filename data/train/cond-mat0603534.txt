    "there is little consensus and understanding of the relaxor s interesting structural and dielectric properties .    in spite of the presence of a peak in the dielectric response , the bulk unit cell in both pmn and pzn remains cubic at all temperatures in the absence of an applied electric field .",

    "@xcite these local regions of ferroelectric order have been referred to as polar nanoregions .    the phonons in pmn and pzn are characterized by a soft , zone center , transverse optic mode ( to ) which becomes highly damped between the burns temperature t@xmath3 , where polar nanoregions are formed , and the lower critical temperature t@xmath5 .",
    "@xcite t@xmath5 in both pmn and pzn is defined as the temperature at which the dielectric susceptibility displays a sharp frequency independent peak under the application of an electric field .",
    "the damping of the to mode is restricted to a small region around the zone centre .",
    "the interpretation of the critical wavevector where the to mode becomes broad has been the subject of much debate recently with several models being proposed including dampening from polar nanoregions , mode - coupling , and a soft quasi - optic mode .",
    "@xcite in contrast to the optic phonons , the transverse acoustic ( ta ) mode does not become strongly damped , however , the linewidth of the ta mode does show a subtle broadening at t@xmath3 , and a recovery below t@xmath5 .",

    "third , we compare the lattice dynamics in pmn-60pt and show the soft optic - mode is very similar to pmn in that it is heavily damped near the zone centre .",
    "the anomolous lattice dynamics near the zone - centre therefore can not be attributed to the presence of short - range polar correlations as previously suggested .",

    "is measured as a to peak is observed at the zone centre .",
    "it is interesting to note that no well defined optic mode was observed near the zone centre between tc and 800 k indicating that optic mode remains damped with little recovery to very high temperatures .",
    "the presence of an overdamped optic mode is further verified by a constant energy scan through the two branches of the optic mode .",
    "[ conste ] plots a scan along the ( 2,q,0 ) direction at a fixed energy transfer of 6.2 mev .",
    "the scan cuts through the two dispersive branches of the optic mode giving rise to two peaks symmetrically displaced from q=0 .",
    "the fact that no well defined peak is observed in a constant - q scan , but observed in a constant energy scan , indicates that the to mode is heavily damped and has a short lifetime associated with it .",
    "the presence of a highly damped to mode over a broad range in temperature near t@xmath5 is very similar to the behavior observed in pmn . in pmn , the optic mode is highly damped between t@xmath5 ( @xmath7 200 k ) and the burns temperature t@xmath3 ( @xmath7 600 k ) . in pmn-60pt ,",
    "the optic mode is damped at least over the range of temperatures of @xmath7 500 k - 800 k. assuming that the temperature ranges scale with t@xmath5 , as they do in pmn and pzn , the broad to mode over such a large temperature range is consistent with the behavior observed in pmn .",
    "the presence of a broad to mode similar in lineshape and temperature dependence to that of pmn , is very surprising as diffuse measurements show that there is an absence of any diffuse scattering indicative of polar nanoregions . in pmn , one possible model for the broad to mode",
    "was that polar nanoregions , which are formed at the burns temperature , significantly damp the optic mode .",
    "this conclusion was drawn from the observation that the diffuse scattering and the dampening were onset at nearly the same temperature .",
    "our measurements on pmn-60pt show that polar nanoregions are absent and are replaced by a long - range ordered structure , indicating that such an interpretation for the dampening of the soft mode needs to be revaluated .    even though the polar nanoregions are small in pmn-60pt and are not directly observable from diffuse scattering , we do observe diffuse scattering along the longitudinal direction indicative of short - range chemical order signifying the presence of a substantial amount of structural disorder .",
    "the b site in this pbbo@xmath2 structure consists of a mixture of b = mg@xmath39 , nb@xmath40 , and ti@xmath41 .",
    "it is likely that the large difference in oxidation states on the b site will introduce large electric field gradients thereby introducing significant random fields .",
    "we therefore conclude that random fields introduced from the substantial amount of chemical disorder is the cause for the overdamped to mode rather than any disorder introduced through polar nanoregions .",
    "the high temperature diffuse scattering represents some form of domains or localized order in the sample , possibly from chemical short - range order as suggested by hiraka _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite a comparison to other disordered structures is given later in the paper .",
    "a comparison of the soft - mode temperature dependence in pmn , and pmn-60pt , and pure pt is presented in fig .",
    "[ soft_mode ] .",
    "the open circles for pmn and pmn-60pt were taken from constant - q scans at the zone centre . for temperatures near t@xmath5 , the zone centre frequency is very difficult to determine as the linewidth becomes large .",
    "we therefore conducted constant - q scans at non - zero @xmath37 away from the zone center and then extrapolated to the zone center using the formula @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the zone centre frequency and @xmath36 was fixed to be temperature independent .",
    "based on this method , the zone centre frequency can be extracted even though the to mode is overdamped near the zone centre and is represented by the filled points in fig .",
    "[ soft_mode ] .",
    "the soft mode behaviors of pmn and pmn-60pt around t@xmath5 are very similar . in both compounds",
    "the to does not completely soften to zero energy , however decreases in energy to @xmath7 5 mev .",
    "both compounds show a clear recovery of the to mode below a characteristic temperature .",
    "it is interesting to note that in pmn-60pt , the recovery occurs below t@xmath5 where a well defined structural transition from a cubic unit cell to tetragonal cell occurs and where there exists a peak in the dielectric response .",
    "however , in pmn , the recovery starts at a much higher temperature of about 400 k. the high temperature recovery maybe more closely associated with the peak in the dielectric response , rather than the temperature where the structural transition is onset under the application of an electric field .",
    "we emphasize that in pure pmn , t@xmath5 is defined as the temperature at which a sharp anomaly appears in the dielectric susceptibility under the application of an electric field . in zero field",
    ", there is no detectable structural transition in the bulk of pmn .     a comparison of the soft mode temperature dependence in pmn , pmn-60pt , and pure pt .",

    "the open circles are to energy values obtained from a direct cosntant - q scan at the zone center.,width=302 ]    the temperature dependence of the soft transverse - optic mode in pmn and pmn-60pt is very different from that in pbtio@xmath2 . the slope of the soft - mode above t@xmath5 is dramatically altered from the pure material and is not described simply by mean - field theory which predicts the slope of the temperature dependence below t@xmath5 to be twice that above t@xmath5 . as noted by halperin and varma  @xcite , in the presence of defects the temperature dependence of the soft - mode can be dramatically altered near t@xmath5 .",
    "therefore , at least qualitatively , the temperature dependence of the soft - mode can be interpreted in terms of slowly relaxing or frozen defects .    in pmn",
    ", there are two well defined temperature scales defined by the behavior of the soft transverse optic mode .",
    "there is a high temperature region where the optic mode reaches a minimum in energy and begins to recover .",
    "there is also a second temperature scale at t@xmath5 where an anomaly appears in the dielectric susceptibility under the application of an electric field .",
    "in contrast to this , pmn-60pt displays one temperature scale where the optic mode recovers in energy and a structural transition occurs .",
    "pmn-60pt does display a broad to mode analogous to pmn .",
    "in contrast to both pmn and pmn-60pt , pure pbtio@xmath2 displays a well defined soft to mode which goes to zero , initiating a structural transition .",
    "therefore , in terms of optic phonons , pmn-60pt is very similar to the behavior of prototypical relaxor ferroelectrics like pmn and pzn .",
    "the temperature dependence and lineshape of the to mode is , however , very different from the behavior in pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "we have shown that there is no strong temperature dependent diffuse scattering in pmn-60pt , in contrast to pure pmn . this has been demonstrated using survey scans done with penetrating 75 kev x - rays , neutron elastic scattering , and also through the absence of any anomalous broadening in the ta mode above t@xmath5 .",
    "the absence of diffuse scattering in pmn-60pt implies that that polar nanoregions are now replaced by large domains and long - range structural order .",
    "we have also shown that there exists a broad transverse optic mode near the zone centre which is very similar to pure pmn .",
    "therefore , the broadening of the to mode ( and hence the waterfall effect ) can not arise from the formation of polar nanoregions .",
    "these results show that the elastic scattering is very similar to a classic ferroelectric , pbtio@xmath2 , however , the dynamics including the soft optic mode are nearly identical to a relaxor ferroelectric with no well defined structural transition .",
    "to investigate a possible microscopic model to consistently explain the diffuse and optic phonon data in pmn and pmn-60pt , we consider the origin of the two types of diffuse scattering in more detail .",
    "it has been shown by hirota _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite and vakhrushev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite that the atomic displacements associated with the diffuse scattering consists of a centre of mass conserving component , associated with the condensation of the optic mode , and a centre of mass shift .",
    "a recent detailed analysis of the acoustic and optic coupling in pmn has shown that mode coupling between the acoustic and optic modes is weak and therefore it is not likely that the centre of mass shift occurs at the same temperature at which the optic mode softens .",
    "@xcite another explanation is that the centre of mass shift is present at much higher temperatures and may be associated with the short - range chemical order indicated by the presence of high - temperature diffuse scattering . in this scenario ,",
    "centre of mass shifted domains occur at a high temperature and give rise to diffuse scattering along the longitudinal direction .",
    "these domains introduce defects into the crystal lattice and significantly damp the optic mode as it softens in energy near t@xmath5 .",
    "the presence of a centre of mass shift at high temperatures therefore consistently explains the presence of both the high - temperature diffuse scattering as well as the significant damping of the optic mode near t@xmath5 throughout the pmn - xpt phase diagram .",
    "the origin of this disorder maybe associated with the disorder on the b site , as the longitudinal diffuse scattering disappears and the damping of the transverse optic mode disappears in the limit of pure pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "the presence of locally shifted regions in the crystal will ultimately introduce defects into the crystal lattice .",
    "one of the simplest examples of a crystal with defects is the h@xmath24-d@xmath24 mixed crystal .",
    "@xcite powell and nielsen describe a theory of phonons in a crystal with defects in which the cross section has two components giving rise to coherent scattering .",
    "the first is a modified phonon cross section resulting in well defined peaks in energy resulting from the excitation of phonons .",
    "the second is a broad resonance diffuse term with a width which is a measure of the density of host modes into which the impurity mode can decay .",
    "the diffuse component was difficult to observe on its own due to the fact that it was extremely broad in momentum and energy and the cross - section depended on the difference of the mixed atoms .",
    "it is interesting to note that that the phonons in h@xmath24-d@xmath24 have some strong similarities to those in the mixed ion relaxor systems . in particular ,",
    "the low energy to mode was observed to significantly broaden in energy at a characteristic wavevector where the to dispersion overlaps with the broad resonance component in the defect phonon cross section . at that particular energy ,",
    "the to mode has a short lifetime due to an increase in the number of decay channels .",
    "the to mode was damped considerably despite the fact that ta mode does not show any significant effect .",
    "this is nearly identical to the behavior in the relaxor ferroelectrics where there is also a characteristic wavevector where the to mode becomes significantly damped .",
    "@xcite we emphasize that this resonance is not a well - defined mode , but a continuum of states providing a new decay channel when a propogating mode ( like the to mode ) crosses the correct energy scale .",
    "the presence of a density of states or a broad resonance contribution to the scattering is further supported by raman and dielectric measurements .",
    "previous dielectric experiments on pmn  @xcite have shown the presence of a finite density of states at low - energies .",
    "this appeared in addition to the soft - mode response which agreed with the soft transverse - mode measured with neutrons .",
    "the calculated neutron scattering spectra at low temperatures displayed the presence of two peaks , the higher energy peak is the soft - mode measured at the zone - centre with neutrons , while the lower - energy peak has not be observed with neutrons .",
    "a similar low - energy peak in the dielectric response has also been observed in pst .",
    "@xcite the new lower energy peak , might represent a broad resonance suggested here which results in significant dampening of the optic mode over a certain range in energy and momentum .    the unusual temperature dependence of the to linewidth in pmn and pmn-60pt can be interpreted in terms of this defect model .",
    "both compounds show a broad to mode which becomes overdamped at a characteristic energy , and hence wavevector .",
    "the fact that broadening only occurs over a finite temperature region can be explained by the fact that the to mode softens considerably with temperature , and therefore only enters the correct characteristic energy region over a finite temperature scale .",
    "the diffuse or broad mode in pmn and pmn-60pt can be associated with defect states introduced by the mixed valency .",
    "these low energy states provide extra decay channels for the to mode over a finite energy range .",
    "this model is consistent and is expected based on a random field model introduced recently to describe the universal properties observed in pmn and pzn .  @xcite    the idea of defects causing extra channels at low - energies for the to mode to decay into is also consistent with a recent model proposed to describe the dynamics by yamada and takakura .",
    "@xcite they proposed that the broadening of the to mode was due to coupling to a random pseudospin variable .",
    "yamada and takakura suggested that a microscopic origin for this could be the random hopping of the pb@xmath39 ion as it has been found that the equilibrium position for pb@xmath39 is slightly displaced from the high symmetry position .",
    "such a model has been supported by @xmath4pb nmr experimental data .",
    "@xcite yamada and takakura described the phonons in pmn utilizing the langenvin equation which describes the atomic motion under a random force .",
    "the phonon model explained the broadening of the to mode near the zone center in accordance with experiment .",
    "this model is identical to that proposed by powell and nielsen to explain defects in h@xmath24-d@xmath24 .",
    "yamada and takakura consider the pb@xmath39 ions to be hopping between sites at a characteristic frequency .",
    "when the soft - optic mode energy is close to the hopping frequency , significant dampening will occur of the extra channels by which the phonon can decay into .",
    "it is important to note that pmn displays two very distinct temperature scales , a high temperature scale where the diffuse scattering is onset ( t@xmath3 ) and a lower temperature ( t@xmath5 ) where a structural transition occurs under the application of an electric field .",
    "these two temperature scales have been interpreted consistently using a random field model .",
    "@xcite random fields have also been suggested by other groups to explain the dynamics and static properties of the relaxors .",
    "@xcite in the random field model proposed , the temperature scales were suggested to result from two universality classes . at high temperatures",
    ", the temperature energy scale can be thought to be much higher than any cubic anisotropy in the system effectively making the system heisenberg like , or possessing a continuous symmetry . at lower temperatures ,",
    "the cubic anisotropy becomes important and the system becomes more ising - like with a discrete symmetry .",
    "both pmn and pzn show two clear temperature scales . in model magnetic systems",
    "it was found that systems with a continuous symmetry are very sensitive to the presence of random fields .",
    "in contrast , systems with a discrete ( or ising ) symmetry are robust to the presence of random fields .    in pmn-60pt ,",
    "there is distinct absence of two temperature scales .",
    "both a structural transition and a recovery of the transverse optic mode occur at the sample temperature .",
    "any model describing the pmn - xpt phase diagram must be able to consistently describe the behavior in pmn , pmn-60pt , and pbtio@xmath2 .",
    "we propose that for increased pt doping the cubic anisotropy becomes more important , as well , the random field must ultimately decrease in the extreme case of pure pbtio@xmath2 , with no mixed valency . in the case of pmn-60pt , the cubic anisotropy must become important as the system undergoes a structural transition to a tetragonal phase , with the atoms shifted along the [ 100 ] directions .",
    "therefore , the system can be thought of as effectively having a discrete symmetry and properties similar to model magnetic systems in the presence of random fields .",
    "@xcite    the presence of a stronger cubic anisotropy in pmn-60pt in comparison to pmn is further reflected in the slopes of the to@xmath25 and to@xmath24 modes . in pmn , the slopes ( as defined by @xmath44 in eqn . [ optic ] )",
    "are nearly identical with @xmath45=590 mev@xmath46 @xmath46 and @xmath47=460 mev@xmath46 @xmath46 . in pmn-60pt ,",
    "the difference is much more dramatic with @xmath45=955 mev@xmath46 @xmath46 and @xmath47=685 mev@xmath46 @xmath46 indicating that the dynamics are more anisotropic in pmn-60pt than in pmn .",
    "our measurements show that the pmn-@xmath48pt phase diagram may provide a unique example of random fields in structural transitions and an opportunity to study the dynamics under a random field where the universality class can be continuously tuned from a continuous to a discrete symmetry .",
    "clearly , further measurements are required for intermediate pt concentrations to provide further credence to this model .",
    "we have presented a detailed elastic and inelastic scattering study of pmn-60pt . through the use of high - energy x - rays and elastic neutron scattering ,",
    "we have shown that any strong diffuse scattering from polar nanoregions is very weak or absent in pmn-60pt in favour of a long - range structural ordered ground state with a tetragonal unit cell . we have found weak predominately longitudinal diffuse scattering indicative of short - range chemical order .",
    "the optic mode is overdamped around t@xmath5 in a similar manner to that in pmn .",
    "we have reconciled this by suggesting that the short - range chemical order provides extra channels at low - energies into which the the to mode can decay into , analogous to the case of the defect crystal h@xmath24-d@xmath24 and to the pb@xmath39 ion hopping model proposed by yamada and takakura .",
