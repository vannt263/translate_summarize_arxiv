    "various eruptive processes in the solar atmosphere as well as convective motions beneath the photosphere generate magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves .",
    "propagation of waves in an inhomogeneous plasma can result in wave energy dissipation , which is known to contribute into the general energy balance of the solar corona .",
    "behaviour of mhd waves is governed by the topology of magnetic field and gradients of mhd quantities .",
    "singularities of the magnetic field topology are null points , at which the magnetic field magnitude is equal to zero .",
    "dissipation of the wave energy is believed to occur most efficiently near magnetic null points . in the solar corona , where the plasma beta is much less than unity , a fast - mode mhd wave is subject to significant deceleration at nulls , which therefore are the regions of the accumulation of the wave energy .",
    "the amplitude of the wave and gradients of all mhd quantities increase considerably due to the alfvn speed decrease as well as the wave front convergence in the vicinity of the null point , where the wave becomes nonlinear .",
    "the wave profile steepens and the initially linear wave transforms into a shock .",
    "another important effect of the increase of the gradients is the appearance of steep spikes of the electric current density in the vicinity of the null point , as it was demonstrated by and modelled numerically by and .",
    "these circumstances result in rapid conversion of the wave energy into heat .",
    "topological properties of magnetic null points have been studied well ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , the review by ) and the behaviour of waves in the vicinity of a null point has been investigated by many authors ( see the review by ) .",
    "consider the incidence of a linear fast - mode wave on a 2d null point both numerically and analytically using the wentzel ",
    "kramers  brillouin ( wkb ) approximation .",
    "the authors neglect the plasma pressure against magnetic pressure and assign the sound speed to be zero .",
    "their analysis shows that ray paths along which the wave travels get curved towards the null point due to refraction .",
    "the wave envelops the null point and its energy is converted to heat .",
    "then consider the wave incidence on a 2d null point formed by two magnetic dipoles . in this case , only a portion of the wave and its energy are captured by the null point .",
    "the rest propagates away .",
    "the assumption of zero sound speed is a significant restriction for the problem of interest .",
    "the solar coronal plasma has a temperature of about @xmath0 k , which gives a sound speed of about @xmath1 km s@xmath2 .",
    "there is an area around the null point , in which the sound speed @xmath3 is greater than the alfvn speed @xmath4 .",
    "this considerably affects wave propagation .",
    "the wave is able to pass through the null point in this case .",
    "a numerical modelling and analytical analysis of this problem is carried out , in the linear approximation , by . in their numerical study",
    ", they also find conversion of the wave modes when the wave crosses the @xmath5  layer .",
    "further , consider the wave propagation near a 3d magnetic null point under the assumption of cold plasma , using the wkb approach .",
    "this investigation confirms capturing the wave by the null point as well as plasma heating at that place .",
    "we note that in the analytical studies mentioned , the authors model only the wave front propagation and do not examine the wave amplitude evolution .",
    "the propagation of a nonlinear wave near a magnetic null point is investigated by for the magnetic reconnection problem .",
    "their numerical modelling shows a complex pattern including the formation of a current sheet as well as the generation of secondary shock waves . using a similar numerical approach , study the nonlinear wave propagation to understand the triggering of the sympathetic solar flares .",
    "the aim of this paper is to analyse analytically nonlinear effects of the weak fast - mode mhd shock wave propagation near a magnetic null point and calculate the wave amplitude evolution for the coronal heating problem .",
    "we do not study mode conversion as well as the transformation of the null point into a current sheet by the shock wave , since the ray method is not able to take this into account .",
    "the paper has the following outline .",
    "we consider the linear wave case in section  [ s - linear wave ] , then the case of a shock wave in section  [ s - shock wave ] and discuss the results obtained .",
    "section  [ s - conclusion ] contains concluding remarks . in the appendices we give bulky mathematical details of our investigation",
    "in this study we explore a two - dimensional magnetic null point , which is located at the point of origin and specified in cartesian coordinates @xmath6 as @xmath7 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) . in this model",
    ", the magnetic field magnitude grows linearly with the distance from the null point .",
    "the plasma density @xmath8 and temperature @xmath9 are assumed to be constant , so the sound speed @xmath10 is also constant and the alfvn speed @xmath11 distribution is governed only by that of the magnetic field . here",
    "@xmath12 is the molar mass of hydrogen , @xmath13 the average atomic weight of an ion , @xmath14 the adiabatic index , and @xmath15 the gas constant .",
    "the alfvn speed vanishes completely at the null point and grows to infinity away from it .      at",
    "first we consider the case of a cold plasma , with the sound speed @xmath3 being zero overall .",

    ", one can obtain a hamilton ",
    "jacobi partial differential equation for the eikonal of fast - mode mhd waves ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ): @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the fast - mode velocity in plasma , @xmath23 the angle between the direction of the wave propagation and the magnetic field vector . solving the equation with the method of characteristics",
    "gives the set of ray equations , which are a set of ordinary differential equations . in appendix [ s - appendix1 ]",
    "we provide this set of equations ( see equations  ( [ e - ray_eq_system ] ) ) . succeeded in finding an exact analytical solution of the set for the magnetic field model under consideration : @xmath24 where @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the initial values of a ray path .    . at the initial moment",
    ", the plane wave front was located at @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the axes are shown in the normalised units.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the null point attracts the wave , so all the ray paths tend to the origin where the null point is located .",
    "figure [ f - prop_pattern_lin_cold ] shows the ray pattern . in both the figures and calculations throughout the paper",
    ", we use normalised units .",
    "the normalising values are the characteristic spatial scale of the problem , and the magnetic field strength and the alfvn speed at the distance of the characteristic spatial scale from the null point .",
    "the normalising time value is then set as the ratio of the characteristic spatial scale to the characteristic alfvn speed .",
    "however , it is essential not only to find the wave geometry , but also to calculate the wave intensity .",
    "geometrical acoustics allows the wave amplitude variation to be calculated .    in linear geometrical acoustics , the energy flux of a disturbance travelling at group velocity @xmath30 in a stationary medium",
    "is directed along the rays , and its magnitude is conserved within a ray tube @xcite , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the average density of the disturbance energy , @xmath8 the undisturbed plasma density , and @xmath33 the plasma velocity components along the normal @xmath34 to the wave front and across it , respectively . taking into account the relation between the plasma velocity components @xcite ,",
    "@xmath35 , it is possible to relate the variation of the wave amplitude to the cross section @xmath36 of the ray tube formed by a bundle of rays : @xmath37    we calculate the cross section , using the jacobian of the transformation from cartesian coordinates to ray ones @xcite .",
    "the volume element @xmath38 of the ray tube is expressed in terms of the ray coordinates @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the jacobian .",
    "then for the cross section of the ray tube , @xmath36 , we have @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the ray length . let the ray coordinate @xmath44 be the initial value @xmath26 .",
    "using equations ( [ e - xz - solutions ] ) and ( [ e - ds_wave_amp_variation ] ) we obtain the expressions for the wave amplitude @xmath45 along the ray with the initial values @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( @xmath46 is the initial amplitude ) : @xmath47 if we assume the wave amplitude @xmath45 to be the component @xmath48 of the plasma velocity vector along the normal to the wave front , or @xmath49 if we assume @xmath45 to be the magnitude of the plasma velocity vector , @xmath50 .",
    "figure [ f - amplitude_lin_cold ] shows time evolution of the wave amplitude along two different rays .",
    "the amplitude plots in the paper are shown in the units of the initial amplitude .",
    "the plasma velocity component @xmath48 oscillates and drops to zero from time to time , while the magnitude of the plasma velocity grows exponentially",
    ". such behaviour of the component @xmath48 is due to changing the direction of the wave propagation .",
    "the wave front element travels around the null point and sometimes the wave front normal @xmath34 becomes collinear to the magnetic field @xmath51 , _ i.e. _ @xmath52 or @xmath53 . at these points ,",
    "the component @xmath48 disappears but the component @xmath54 becomes equal to the magnitude of the plasma velocity vector at that moment .",
    "there is also the opposite case : when the @xmath55 the component @xmath54 drops to zero .",
    "so the solid line marking the magnitude of the plasma velocity is an envelope line .",
    "note that in figure [ f - amplitude_lin_cold ] we plot a relative variation of the amplitude and adjust the magnitude of the plasma velocity vector to be unity at the initial moment .",
    "it means that for the component @xmath48 we actually use equation  ( [ e - wave_amp_expr_u ] ) divided by @xmath56",
    ".      now we consider the case of a warm plasma with non - zero sound speed .",
    "let points where the alfvn speed is equal to the sound speed be named the @xmath5 layer ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , ) . in the problem of interest , the case of a warm plasma",
    "corresponds to the situation when the wave propagates near the @xmath5 layer , while in the case of a cold plasma the wave propagation is considered far from it .",
    "the ray equations become more complex and we have to integrate them numerically . to calculate the jacobian and find the wave amplitude , we use a method based on numerical integration of the so - called adjoint set of equations . solving the adjoint set",
    "allows the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath58 to be calculated . for more details",
    ", we refer the reader to the paper by .",
    "appendix [ s - appendix1 ] contains the set of ray equations ( see equations  ( [ e - ray_eq_system ] ) ) as well as the adjoint set ( see equations  ( [ e - adj_system ] ) ) , which we solve to model the wave propagation .",
    "like we find that the wave passes through the null point .",
    "figure [ f - prop_pattern_lin_warm ] shows the wave propagation in this case .",
    "we study behaviour of the wave front , which was located at @xmath59 and @xmath60 at the initial moment , however we plot the rays outgoing from a central part of the wave front for clearing the ray pattern . unlike the cold plasma case",
    ", ray paths begin to intersect near the top boundary of the @xmath5 layer .",
    "this results in the considerable distortion of the wave front as well as the subsequent formation of a caustic .    by definition ,",
    "a caustic is an envelope of a family of rays , _",
    "i.e. _ rays approach each other at points of the caustic @xcite , and therefore a caustic can be identified in the ray pattern as a ray crowding .",
    "the jacobian and the ray - tube cross sections drop to zero at the caustic points and the wave amplitude grows indefinitely .",
    "figure  [ f - amplitude_lin_warm ] shows evolution of the wave amplitude along two rays outlined by red in figure [ f - prop_pattern_lin_warm ] . marking points of the ray paths where the amplitude tends to infinity for the first time ( since this can occur twice along some rays during the calculation time in our modelling ) we can obtain the caustic line . the bottom panel in figure [ f - prop_pattern_lin_warm ] shows the inner part of the caustic , associated with a central part of the wave .",
    "the rest of the caustic encompasses the null point , bending away from it .",
    "the outer parts of the caustic form if the initial front is rather extensive . besides , if the calculation time is also rather long it is possible to identify secondary ( repeated ) caustics . for instance",
    ", one of them can be seen in the top panel of figure [ f - prop_pattern_lin_warm ] as a cusp at the lower part of the plot .",
    "note that in the linear cold plasma case there are no caustics in the neighbourhood of the null point .",
    "the singular behaviour of the wave amplitude indicates that the ray approximation does not work at the caustic .",
    "indeed , more accurate considerations show that the amplitude grows but it always remains finite @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , caustics give important information on the amplitude distribution along the wave front . at every moment ,",
    "the wave amplitude increases significantly at a few points ( the caustic does not `` fire up '' simultaneously throughout its extent ) .",
    "caustics in the ray pattern represent the places of the most efficient plasma heating associated with the wave .",
    "the energy of the wave accumulates in the neighbourhood of the null point , but this accumulation is distributed in space , unlike the cold plasma case .",
    "our calculations show that the size of the @xmath5 layer may be chosen as the characteristic spatial scale of the heated region around the null point .    analysing the caustic pattern we can also readily explain the complicated surface of the wave front mentioned in .",
    "a break of the wave front occurs at the caustic ( see figure [ f - prop_pattern_lin_warm ] ) , so `` small triangular shapes '' of the wave front arise at the caustic cusps .",
    "vertices of these triangles travel along the caustic lines as the wave front propagates .",
    "as seen in section [ s - linear wave - cold plasma ] , the wave amplitude grows exponentially as the wave approaches the null point .",
    "this results in the nonlinear steepening of the wave front and therefore a shock wave formation .",
    "so we should take into account nonlinear properties of shock waves and investigate how they affect the wave propagation .",
    "firstly , a nonlinear plane disturbance in an ideal homogeneous medium propagates at speed that exceeds the fast - mode velocity and depends on the disturbance amplitude . in a nonlinear acoustics approximation , a fast - mode wave element with plasma velocity component @xmath48 normal to the front moves at a speed of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the numerical coefficient depending both on the plasma beta and the angle @xmath23 between the wave front normal and the magnetic field ( see appendix [ s - appendix1 ] )",
    "the fact that each element of the wave travels at its own speed causes the wave profile deformation and the appearance of a shock wave . in turn , a weak shock moves at a speed of @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the jump of the plasma velocity component @xmath48 in the shock .",
    "secondly , the nonlinear wave amplitude undergoes additional damping associated with the energy dissipation in the discontinuity . on the one hand",
    ", the shock wave amplitude increases due to the convergence of rays as well as the alfvn speed decrease . on the other hand",
    ", the amplitude decreases due to the nonlinear damping .",
    "the above - mentioned basic properties of shock waves are taken into account in the method of nonlinear geometrical acoustics .",
    "it allows one to calculate the propagation of disturbances with small but finite amplitudes ( _ i.e. _ weak shock waves ) through an inhomogeneous medium . to familiarise the readers with details of the method used ,",
    "we refer them to the papers by and .",
    "besides , in appendix [ s - appendix1 ] we give the set of nonlinear ray equations ( see equations  ( [ e - ray_eq_system ] ) ) , which we solve to model the weak shock wave propagation , and in appendix [ s - appendix2 ] we present derivation of the nonlinear ray equations .     in the cold plasma case .",
    "the thick lines correspond to the amplitude of the shock wave and the thin ones correspond to the amplitude variation due to only the convergence of rays and the @xmath4  decrease ( without dissipation in the discontinuity ) .",
    "the dashed lines denote the jump @xmath64 of the plasma velocity component @xmath48 in the shock wave , the solid ones  that of the plasma velocity magnitude .",
    "the horizontal axis is shown in the normalised time units , the vertical axis is shown in the units of the initial amplitude.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    figure [ f - prop_pattern_shock_cold ] shows the propagation of a weak shock wave in a cold plasma . like the linear cold plasma case ,",
    "the wave is captured by the null point and wraps around it . however , the propagation speed at the null point is non - zero owing to nonlinearity and the shock wave passes through the null point ( cf . ) like a linear wave in a plasma with the small sound speed .",
    "therefore , in this case a caustic also arises in the small neighbourhood of the null point .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ f - prop_pattern_shock_cold]b , which shows the propagation pattern in a small area around the null point .",
    "the caustic is seen as the sharp border of a ray crowding .",
    "the amplitude of the wave tends to infinity at the caustic .",
    "this indicates again the places of significant plasma heating .",
    "the wave front elements being close to the null point have higher amplitudes and therefore they travel faster .",
    "this results in forming a bulge in the wave front , which is visible in figure [ f - prop_pattern_shock_cold]b underneath the null point .",
    "figure [ f - amplitude_shock_cold ] shows the shock wave amplitude .",
    "it decays considerably due to dissipation of the wave energy in the shock front . for comparison",
    "we also plot variation of the wave amplitude calculated with the assumption that there was no dissipation in the shock front .",
    "these plots demonstrate that a significant part of the shock wave energy is spent on plasma heating .",
    "we have also considered the propagation of a weak shock wave in a warm plasma . in this case",
    "both nonlinearity of the wave and the non - zero sound speed in a plasma work in the same way .",
    "the shock wave propagates through the null point and a caustic is formed .",
    "the ray pattern is shown in figure [ f - prop_pattern_shock_warm ] .",
    "the caustic is quite similar to that in figure [ f - prop_pattern_lin_warm ] for the linear warm plasma case , however it is shifted in the direction of the wave incidence .",
    "an effect of the non - zero sound speed appears to predominate over that of the wave nonlinearity .",
    "this is not unusual if we keep in mind that the nonlinear geometrical acoustics method should be applied only for weak shock waves .",
    "we also note that two caustic cusps are located at the @xmath5  layer .",
    "layer , the solid ones are the rays . at the initial moment , the plane wave front was located at @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the axes are shown in the normalised units.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "we have applied the nonlinear geometrical acoustics method to model the propagation of a fast - mode mhd wave near a 2d magnetic null point .",
    "we have considered both a linear wave and a weak shock and calculated their behaviour in cold and warm plasmas .",
    "we have also calculated the wave amplitude , using the ray approximation and the laws of solitary shock wave damping .",
    "the nonlinear ray method allows one to trace the wave front and calculate the jumps of mhd quantities at the front only , but it does not give information on the downstream plasma flow evolution , since irreversible processes occur behind the shock front . in the propagation model",
    "used taking into account the refraction effect ( _ i.e. _ the wrapping effect ) , the wave front can encounter plasma `` upstream '' that at an earlier time was described as `` downstream '' . in this sense ,",
    "the presented nonlinear ray equations are valid for weak shock waves , if there are no subsequent shock front intersections . nevertheless , to investigate plasma heating we calculate the caustic pattern , neglecting the modified downstream plasma , which is correct for weak shock waves .",
    "we note again that since subsequent evolution of the downstream plasma flow can not be analysed with the method used , we do not discuss the transformation of a null point into a current sheet under the shock wave effect .    for a linear wave approaching the null point in a cold plasma , the analytical law of the amplitude growth has been found .",
    "the wave amplitude increases exponentially and therefore the initially linear wave transforms into a shock , which has encouraged us to investigate the case of shock wave propagation .",
    "this analytical law expressed by equation  ( [ e - wave_amp_expr_u ] ) ( and equation  ( [ e - wave_amp_expr_magnitude ] ) ) is consistent with the analytical solution that was obtained for the problem of the incidence of a cylindrically symmetric fast - mode wave on a 2d null point (; ; ) .",
    "indeed , in their solution the radial component of the plasma velocity in the wave grows as @xmath67 with the distance @xmath68 to the null point . in the cylindrically symmetric case all the rays are straight and directed to the null point .",
    "so we have the following ray equation : @xmath69 , and hence we obtain : @xmath70 , _ i.e. _ , the wave amplitude grows exponentially , like that in equation  ( [ e - wave_amp_expr_u ] ) .",
    "the additional time dependence in equation  ( [ e - wave_amp_expr_u ] ) is due to the plain ( not cylindrical ) initial wave front and represents the fact that all the rays are different and depend on initial coordinate @xmath26 .",
    "a complex caustic is formed around the magnetic null point .",
    "the wave amplitude tends to infinity at the caustic , resulting in plasma heating .",
    "the heating is distributed in space and occurs mainly out of the @xmath5  layer if the initial wave front is rather extensive .",
    "however , the first heating associated with a central part of the wave occurs within the @xmath5  layer . on the contrary , in the well - known case of a linear wave in a cold plasma",
    ", plasma heating takes place in a small vicinity of the null point . since real null points in the solar corona",
    "appear to capture only a ( central ) part of the wave , while its outer part propagates away , the size of the @xmath5 layer may be chosen as the spatial scale of plasma heating .",
    "nonlinearity of a wave is crucial for its propagation .",
    "a shock wave is able to pass through a null point even in a cold plasma .",
    "the growth of the shock wave amplitude is restricted , since shock waves decay significantly due to the nonlinear energy dissipation in the shock front .",
    "therefore along with the heating at a caustic , a substantial heating of plasma occurs in the neighbourhood of the null point . a significant part of the shock wave energy transforms into heat there .",
    "drawing the caustic pattern , we have explained the complicated surface of the wave front .",
    "a break of the wave front occurs at the caustic , thus triangles of the wave front arise when the front passes through a caustic cusp .",
    "the vertices of the triangles travel along the caustic lines .",
    "to summarise we discuss a chance to estimate the magnitude of plasma heating associated with propagation of waves near a magnetic null point .",
    "conversion of the wave energy into heat occurs due to dissipative processes in a plasma when the gradients of mhd quantities increase significantly . in a linear wave",
    "the gradients grow owing to the wave extent decrease as well as the amplitude growth as the wave approaches a null point . to estimate the value of the energy converted into heat in this case",
    ", one should consider non - ideal magnetohydrodynamics . in turn , in a shock wave the gradients of mhd quantities also originate at the wave front due to the nonlinear steepening of the wave profile . here",
    ", the value of the energy converted is taken into account by the laws of shock wave damping .",
    "since the sound speed in the real solar coronal plasma does not drop to zero , the wave extent can remain rather large , and so viscosity , thermal conductivity and finite plasma conductivity do not result in energy conversion . in such a case",
    "considerable plasma heating will occur due to the wave energy dissipation in the shock front , with the nonlinear heating predominating over heating at caustics .",
    "so , evaluating the difference between the shock wave amplitude and the amplitude calculated without dissipation in the discontinuity ( as in figure  [ f - amplitude_shock_cold ] ) , one can provide some rough estimates about the plasma heating magnitude .",
    "the sets of ray equations have the following form in cartesian coordinates : @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the components of the wave front normal @xmath34 and its magnitude respectively , and @xmath74 the numerical factor switching the linear and nonlinear regimes of the wave propagation .",
    "we should take @xmath75 for studying a linear wave and @xmath76 for a weak shock one .",
    "the adjoint set consists of differential equations for the derivatives @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and is derived by differentiating equations ( [ e - ray_eq_system])(with @xmath75 ) with respect to the ray coordinate @xmath44 : @xmath79 where @xmath80    the numerical coefficient @xmath81 depends on the plasma beta as well as the angle @xmath23 between the wave front normal and the magnetic field as @xmath82 where @xmath83 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 is the adiabatic index .",
    "values of @xmath81 are restricted by the limits @xmath86 and are shown in figure [ f - kappa_surface ] .",
    "when the wave crosses the @xmath5  layer along the magnetic field ( @xmath87 ) , @xmath81 has a jump .    .",
    "the points at the surface denote the relevant values corresponding to some particular cases of propagation .",
    "there is a jump of @xmath81 at @xmath87 and @xmath88.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    set of ray equations  ( [ e - ray_eq_system ] ) is not closed in the nonlinear case since it includes the wave amplitude @xmath64 .",
    "it can be calculated with the laws of solitary shock wave damping ( ) , which are derived by using values of the amplitude and duration of a simple wave from which the shock forms : @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the duration increment of the simple wave with amplitude @xmath91 ; @xmath92 is the initial duration of the shock wave .",
    "the value of @xmath91 can be found from an equation similar to equation ( [ e - ds_wave_amp_variation ] ) .",
    "solving sets of ordinary differential equations ( [ e - ray_eq_system ] ) ,  ( [ e - adj_system ] )  and  ( [ e - damping_laws ] ) numerically we are able to model the propagation of fast - mode mhd waves .",
    "the sets of ray equations can be obtained with a different method which does not use the eikonal expansion of the mhd equations . in fact , this method is different only in form and it is more convenient for analysing nonharmonic waves which we deal with in this paper .",
    "we apply this method for deriving the set of nonlinear ray equations .",
    "the moving surface of the wave front can be described by the equation @xmath93 , or in the differential form @xmath94 .",
    "let a small surface element displace by @xmath95 in time @xmath96 .",
    "then we have : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the velocity of the front element and @xmath99 the wave front normal by definition .",
    "the scalar product can be rewritten as @xmath100 , with the @xmath101 denoting the normal speed of the wave front .",
    "so we obtain a partial differential equation .    if we consider a linear fast - mode mhd wave , @xmath102 , and we have the same `` eikonal '' equation and the same set of ray equations as presented in section  [ s - linear wave - cold plasma ] and appendix [ s - appendix1 ] ( the case of @xmath75 ) , respectively .",
    "however , we are interested in the weak shock wave propagation .",
    "the normal speed of the weak shock front can be derived from the jump conditions across a mhd discontinuity , and it is equal to @xmath103 in the nonlinear acoustics approximation . substituting it into equation  ( [ e - surface_eq ] ) and solving with the method of characteristics , we obtain the set of ray equations , which is similar to the linear one and in",
    "which substitution @xmath104 has been performed . in these new ray equations",
    "the additional terms @xmath105 and @xmath106 appear .",
    "we neglect them , keeping only quantity @xmath64 itself and omitting its derivatives , exploiting the nonlinear geometrical acoustics approximation .",
    "thus we obtain the set of nonlinear ray equations ( [ e - ray_eq_system ] ) ( with @xmath76 ) presented in appendix  [ s - appendix1 ] .",
