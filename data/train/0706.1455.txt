    "orbits ( geodesics with null or non null eccentricity ) in the outer region of kerr space time play an important role in the description of important astrophysical phenomena near black holes .",
    "this space - time , characterized by the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 interpreted as the mass and angular momentum per unit of mass of a rotating hole , can be described in the outer region ( limited by the outer horizon and the asymptotically flat region ) by the boyer - linquist coordinate @xmath2 .",
    "geodesics are characterized by four constants of motion , that are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , representing , respectively , the energy as measured by an observer at infinity , the mass of a test particle , the component of the angular momentum along the axis of symmetry , and the carter s constant , that can be interpreted as the parallel component of the four momentum when the particle crosses the equatorial plane of the hole .",
    "sometimes , it will be interesting to use @xmath5 instead @xmath4 , where @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the conformal killing tensor of the kerr space - time and @xmath8 is the four momentum of the test particle ( remember that @xmath9 ) .",
    "an extended summary of geodesics in kerr space time can be found in the well known chandrasekhar book `` the mathematical theory of black holes '' ( 1983 ) @xcite .",
    "the algebraic complexity of the geodesic equation limited the analytical analysis to particular cases ( geodesics in the equatorial plane , in the extreme kerr geometry @xmath10 , etc .. ) .",
    "more recently e.teo @xcite studied spherical light rays out of equatorial plane finding an analytical expression for the amount of azimuth for a complete latitudinal oscillation of a spherical orbit ( the wilkins effect ) .",
    "this work extends an early result of d.c .",
    "wilkins @xcite devoted to particle spherical orbits in @xmath10 case .",
    "more recently , drasco and hughes @xcite have studied the fundamental orbital frequencies in the `` @xmath11 '' , `` @xmath12 '' and `` @xmath13 '' motion of a test particle using mino time @xcite .",
    "this work improves an elegant proposal of schmidt @xcite , based on the `` action angle variables '' formalism @xcite .    during the last decade ,",
    "several works have been devoted to the study of one of the most important problems in gravitation , where geodesics play an important role , that is , to compute , according to the general relativity , the gravitational radiation that one can expect from different astronomical sources .",
    "one kind of these sources are the so called extreme mass ratio inspiral , emri s : these binary systems are formed as a result of the capture of a compact stelar remnants by supermassive black holes in the nuclei of galaxies .",
    "the dynamics of such systems are ( almost ) purely gravitational , accurately modeled as a point particle of mass @xmath14 , representing the star , following a trajectory in the background space - time created by a kerr black hole . if the ratio @xmath15 is infinitesimal the particle moves along a geodesic . in this system , the particle , having a finite mass , radiates gravitational waves .",
    "in such a case the trajectory deviates from a geodesic , but as the time scale of the orbital evolution is notably smaller than the typical time scale of orbits , the particle ( approximately ) slowly passes from one geodesic to another , conforming the so called `` adiabatic approximation '' . then , radiation reaction effect is characterized by the time evolution of the parameters @xmath16 of orbits .    in order to compute this time evolution of parameters different approaches have been built : using of post newtonian methods , conservation laws , direct computation of self - force and time - domain numerical simulations .",
    "see for example , among others : sago and alt.@xcite which have obtained an analytic formulae for the change rates of the energy , angular momentum ( using balance argument ) and carter constant ( based partially on a mino proposal @xcite using the radiative field ) ( see references therein ) , or s. drasco and s.a .",
    "hughes @xcite , that have recently studied the gravitational wave snapshots of generic extreme mass ratio inspirals , or the 2007 work `` improved approximated inspirals of test - bodies into kerr black holes '' of gair and glampedakis @xcite , etc . .",
    "in all these papers adiabatic approximation is implemented , and thus , an accurately knowledge of orbits in kerr black hole is needed . as an interesting example , we focus on the work of different authors that have contributed to the study of the gravitational radiation effect on the spherical orbits showing that one spherical orbit remains spherical after radiation in the adiabatic approximation ( see @xcite , @xcite,@xcite , etc .. ) .    in this context ,",
    "our main goal is to carry out an exhaustive analysis of orbits of test particle in the outer region of the kerr space - time improving our theoretical knowledge , but trying to show how one orbit is related to each other , in other words , if they can connect through a continuous change of parameters .",
    "we extend the analytical results on the equatorial plane to the whole outer region finding the set of values that constants of motion can reach and showing the range of coordinates that we expect for an allowed set of constants of motions of physical null and non - null eccentricity orbits .",
    "this analysis allow us to have a global view of all orbits that we show in a formal three - dimensional ( normalized ) parameters space , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 in this parameter space each orbit is represented by a point .",
    "the whole set of orbits is confined in a compact volume ( see figure ( [ estrella ] ) that partially diverge when @xmath20 and vanishes when @xmath21 ( see equation ( [ z , x , a ] ) for @xmath22 definitions ) .",
    "spherical orbits are represented by an upper face ( stable ) and a lower one ( unstable ) .",
    "slices of this volume with @xmath23 come first ( @xmath18 slightly less than @xmath24 ) a pseudo - rectangle ( upper side to stable , lower side to unstable , the two bases for orbits on the equatorial plane ) , and after ( @xmath25 ) a pseudo - triangle ( the two sides of spherical orbits joints in one vertex when @xmath26 see ( [ z , x , a ] ) ) showing that this triangle vanishes when @xmath27 ( see section 4 ) .",
    "this representation in the space of parameters allow us to study the different paths that a particle can follow going through different geodesics after a continuous change of constants of motion . as an specific application",
    ", we obtain the necessary and sufficient condition that evolving parameters have to accomplish to go from one spherical geodesic to another , showing its limits of application .",
    "this result can also be found in @xcite and @xcite in different scenarios and using different techniques .    in section ii , iii and iv we analyze the geodesics out of the equatorial plane in kerr space time using well known results in literature @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . in section v and vi we construct the abstract 3-space of parameters showing the geometrical locus of spherical and non null eccentricity orbits in that space , respectively . some proofs can be find in appendices i and ii .    * first order differential equations for geodesic motion of massive particles*.    using the hamilton - jacobi method , carter found the equations of motion for test particles ( see for example @xcite ) . in the boyer - linquist",
