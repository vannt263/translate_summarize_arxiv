    "almost twenty years after discovery of high  temperature superconductors ( htscs ) the mechanism responsible for their unusual properties remains unclear .",
    "the complex phase diagram of htscs suggests that there may be no single mechanism that dominates over the entire doping range .",
    "in particular , the normal  state properties in underdoped and overdoped regimes are different .",
    "highly overdoped compounds in the normal state exhibit fermi liquid behavior , whereas the superconducting state may be described within a weak  coupling bcs theory@xcite . on the other hand , in the underdoped regime the htscs exhibit unconventional features .",
    "the most remarkable of them are the extremely short coherence length and a pseudogap that opens in the normal state .",
    "the presence of the pseudogap has been confirmed with the help of various experimental techniques like : angle  resolved photoemission @xcite , intrinsic tunneling spectroscopy @xcite , nmr @xcite , infrared @xcite and transport @xcite measurements .",
    "although , there is no complete theoretical description of the pseudogap , one usually considers this phase as a precursor of the superconductivity .",
    "according to this hypothesis formation of cooper pairs starts at temperature @xmath3 , higher than the superconducting transition temperature @xmath4 . then , at @xmath4 , these preformed pairs undergo bose - einstein condensation .",
    "this hypothesis seems to be supported by recent observations of the vortex  like nernst signal above @xmath4 @xcite that evolves smoothly into the analogous signal below the superconducting phase transition @xcite .",
    "the meissner effect does not occur in the pseudogap phase due to strong phase fluctuations rather than the vanishing of the superfluid density .",
    "therefore , theoretical description of the suppression of the meissner effect requires an approach beyond the mean  field level . despite the absence of the meissner effect above @xmath5",
    ", one can observe inhomogeneous magnetic domains that are interpreted as precursors to the meissner state @xcite .",
    "the short coherence length indicates that the pairing takes place in the real space , leading to boson  like objects .",
    "a few models are commonly used to describe systems with the local pairs .",
    "namely , the attractive hubbard ( ah ) model @xcite , fermion ",
    "boson@xcite and purely bosonic models@xcite , as well as the penson  kolb ( pk ) model@xcite , i.e. , the tight  binging model with local pair hopping .",
    "these models should be considered as effective approaches which do not explain the microscopic origin of the pairing interaction .",
    "another unusual property of htscs is related to their behavior in the external magnetic field . in particular ,",
    "temperature dependence of the upper critical field @xmath6 has a positive curvature@xcite in contradistinction to classical superconductors , where a negative curvature is observed .",
    "moreover , @xmath6 does not saturate even at genuinely low temperature .",
    "recent experiments@xcite show that also the pseudogap is destroyed by sufficiently high magnetic field , @xmath7 .",
    "although , the temperature dependence of @xmath7 has a negative curvature , it significantly differs from the predictions of the standard helfand  werthammer theory@xcite .",
    "namely , @xmath8 has a large slope at temperatures close to @xmath3 and saturates already at @xmath9 .",
    "these features may assist in verification of the preformed cooper pairs hypothesis and , more generally , in choosing the most appropriate model of htsc .",
    "in the present paper we show that opening of the pseudogap and its dependence on the magnetic field can be described within a model with local pair hopping .",
    "our starting point is the two  dimensional ( 2d ) penson  kolb model with the hamiltonian given by : @xmath10 here , @xmath11 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath12 at site @xmath13 , @xmath14 is the single electron hopping integral between sites @xmath13 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 is the chemical potential and @xmath17 is the nearest neighbor pair hopping interactions .",
    "the external magnetic field perpendicular to the lattice @xmath18 shifts the energy levels by @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the gyromagnetic ratio and @xmath21 is the bohr magneton ) and modifies the hopping terms . the single electron hopping integral acquires the peierls factor @xmath22 whereas the phase factor in the pair hopping term is twice larger .",
    "the penson  kolb model can be derived from a general microscopic tight ",
    "binding hamiltonian@xcite , where the coulomb repulsion may lead to the pair hopping interaction .",
    "in such a case @xmath17 is negative ( repulsive penson  kolb model ) .",
    "however , treating the penson  kolb model as of a phenomenological nature , we assume @xmath17 to be an effective parameter , that can be negative as well as positive .",
    "it can be understood as a result of renormalization originating , e.g. , from electron  phonon coupling@xcite . for a nonzero single electron hopping integral",
    "@xmath23 is not a symmetry of the pk model @xcite .",
    "however , superconducting correlations occur in the penson  kolb model for attractive pair hopping interaction ( @xmath24 ) as well as for the repulsive one ( @xmath25 , provided that the pair hopping is large enough .",
    "the latter case is usually referred to as @xmath2type pairing . then , the total momentum of the paired electrons is @xmath26 and the phase of superconducting order parameter alters from one site to the neighboring one .",
    "it has been shown that there is a flux quantization and meissner effect in this state.@xcite superconductivity survives also in the presence of on  site coulomb repulsion ( penson  kolb  hubbard model ) , provided that this interaction is not too large@xcite .      at the mean  field level , for @xmath24",
    "one obtains an isotropic superconducting gap , identical to that obtained for ah model . on the other hand , in the case of @xmath2type pairing ( @xmath27 ) ,",
    "the density of states is finite for arbitrary energy .",
    "however , the density of states at the fermi level may significantly be suppressed for some dopings . in the simplest case of the nearest neighbor hopping the density of states in the @xmath2phase",
    "is of the form : @xmath28 here , @xmath29 , @xmath30 is the @xmath2phase order parameter and @xmath31 is the density of states for @xmath32 .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "( [ rho ] ) that the quasiparticle poles split when @xmath33 becomes finite .",
    "therefore , a local minimum in the density of states may occur at the fermi surface . despite the presence of this minimum the density of states at the fermi level",
    "remains finite provided that @xmath34 is small when compared to the band width .",
    "inclusion of the next nearest neighbor hopping @xmath35 leads to a more complicated expression for the density of states .",
    "however , the structure of @xmath36 in the @xmath2phase remains unchanged .",
    "1 . shows the density of states calculated for @xmath37 and different values of the @xmath2phase order parameter .",
    "we have used @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the curves from the topmost to the lowest correspond to the values of the order parameter @xmath40 the dashed line indicates the fermi level.,width=283 ]    gradual decreasing of @xmath36 at the fermi level resembles opening of the pseudogap in htscs .    another feature that could speak in favor of this interpretation is anisotropy of the gap @xcite .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath37 the magnitude of splitting of the quasiparticle peaks depends on the direction in the brillouin zone .",
    "the splitting of the spectral functions is presented in fig .",
    "2 . as we consider isotropic order parameter the splitting is finite everywhere at the fermi level , in contradistinction to a purely @xmath1wave gap .",
    "however , this drawback may be removed when considering a nonlocal pairing .    , whereas the dashed lines have been obtained for @xmath41.,width=283 ]      in contradistinction to the ah model , the external magnetic field explicitly enters the term responsible for superconductivity , i.e. , the pair hopping interaction .",
    "therefore , the differences between ah and pk models may show up in the electromagnetic properties @xcite . here",
    ", we investigate the temperature dependence of critical field @xmath42 .",
    "it is defined as the highest magnitude of the magnetic field , for that there exists a non  zero solution for the superconducting order parameter : @xmath43 as we carry out calculations at the mean  field level it is impossible to determine the phase coherence of the cooper pairs .",
    "therefore , the physical interpretation of the critical field is not unique . in the overdoped regime of cuprates",
    "it can directly correspond to the upper critical field . on the other hand , for underdoped systems , and within the precursor scenario of pseudogap",
    ", it can be interpreted as @xmath7 , i.e. , the field at which the incoherent pairs appear .",
    "one can argue that the pk model can also be used as an effective model of other superconductors that are characterized by a short coherence length : barium bismuthates , fullerides , chevrel phases , organic superconductors and heavy fermion systems .",
    "@xcite in these cases @xmath42 should be considered as @xmath6 .    for the sake of simplicity",
    "we define : @xmath44 where the prime means that the summation is carried out over the nearest neighbors of site @xmath13 .",
    "then , the mean  field hamiltonian takes on the following form : @xmath45 at the mean  field level the only difference between pk and ah models is the presence of @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ hmf ] ) instead of @xmath47 .",
    "therefore , in order to calculate the critical field one can follow an approach , that has previously been developed for the lattice gas with on  site attraction @xcite . then",
    ", one ends up with the lattice version of the gorkov equations : @xmath48 here , @xmath49 is the one  electron green s function in the presence of a uniform and static magnetic field .",
    "@xmath50 denotes the fermionic matsubara frequency . with the help of eq.([td ] ) one can eliminate @xmath51 from the gorkov equations .",
    "then , @xmath52 can be calculated from @xmath53 or @xmath54 eqs .",
    "( [ s ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) are equivalent since @xmath55 , for the neighboring sites @xmath15 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , it is more convenient to use the first / second of them for attractive / repulsive pair hopping interaction .    in the following we consider only the nearest ",
    "neighbor one  particle hopping integral @xmath57 and use the landau gauge @xmath58 .",
    "then , the harper equation @xmath59 determines eigenvalues @xmath60 of the one  particle hopping term .",
    "the corresponding eigenstates are enumerated by @xmath61 and are of the form : @xmath62 here , @xmath63 are integers which enumerate the lattice sites in @xmath64 and @xmath65 directions , whereas @xmath66 is a ratio of the flux through a lattice cell to one flux quantum .",
    "we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite for the details .",
    "the one  electron green s function can be expressed with the help of eigenvalues and eigenstates of the normal  state hamiltonian .",
    "then , the summation over matsubara frequencies in eqs .",
    "( [ s ] ) and ( [ eta ] ) can explicitly be carried out . in the landau gauge",
    "the presence of magnetic field does not change the plane  wave behavior in @xmath67direction [ see eq .",
    "( [ uxy ] ) ] .",
    "therefore , the superconducting order parameter depends only on @xmath68 and pairing of electrons takes place for the same @xmath67components of their momenta , as in the absence of magnetic field , i.e. , @xmath69 for @xmath24 and @xmath70 for @xmath27 .",
    "taking these features into account one can rewrite the gorkov equations for the attractive : @xmath71 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\ ; g\\left(\\bar{p}_x , p_y , x^{\\prime}\\right ) g\\left(\\bar{k}_x ,- p_y , x^{\\prime}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as well as for the repulsive pair hopping interaction : @xmath72 \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times \\ ; g\\left(\\bar{p}_x , p_y , x^{\\prime}\\right ) g\\left(\\bar{k}_x,\\pi - p_y , x^{\\prime}\\right).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath73 and the cooper pair susceptibility @xmath74 has the following form : @xmath75 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\left[2\\left(e\\left(\\bar{p}_{x},p_{y}\\right)+e\\left(\\bar{k}_{x } , k_{y}\\right)-2\\mu\\right ) \\right]^{-1}.",
    "\\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the above equations determine the strength of magnetic field at which the local pairing disappears . we have carried out calculations for @xmath76 cluster with periodic boundary conditions ( bc ) along the @xmath77 axis . as the landau gauge breaks the translation invariance along @xmath78 axis we have used fixed bc in this direction .",
    "our previous calculations indicate that such a size of cluster is sufficient to obtain convergent results.@xcite     for @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "continuous curve has been obtained for the pk model with @xmath81 ( @xmath2type pairing ) .",
    "the dashed line corresponds the attractive pair hopping interaction @xmath82 .",
    "the dotted line shows the critical field in the ah model with @xmath83.,width=283 ]    fig .",
    "3 shows the temperature dependence of @xmath42 obtained for attractive and for the repulsive pair hopping interaction .",
    "these results are compared with @xmath52 calculated from the 2d ah model@xcite with @xmath84 .",
    "we have adjusted the strength of the pair hopping interaction to obtain the same critical temperature in the absence of magnetic field . for @xmath24 @xmath52 in pk model",
    "is very close to that of ah model .",
    "it means that in the case of @xmath0wave pairing the peierls factor in the pair hopping term leads only to a small decrease of superconducting correlations .",
    "however , the temperature dependence of @xmath42 in the @xmath2state differs qualitatively from the @xmath0wave case .",
    "namely , @xmath52 has a very large slope for a weak magnetic field and saturates already at relatively high temperature .",
    "such a behavior of the critical field resembles @xmath8 , that has recently been observed in @xmath85.@xcite in fig .",
    "4 we compare our results and the experimental data .",
    ".@xcite the continuous line represents @xmath52 calculated for the repulsive pair hopping interaction .",
    "we have used the same model parameters as for the @xmath2pairing in fig .",
    "3.,width=283 ]    within the helfand ",
    "werthammer theory , the temperature dependence of critical field is predominantly determined by the diamagnetic pair breaking mechanism . the zeeman coupling becomes important only for sufficiently strong magnetic field .",
    "this feature holds also in the case of the lattice gas.@xcite in order to investigate the role of the zeeman and orbital contributions in pk model , we have repeated our calculations in the absence of the zeeman term .",
    "the resulting @xmath52 is shown in fig .",
    "5 .     calculated for attractive and repulsive pk model with and without the zeeman coupling .",
    "we have used the same model parameters as in fig .",
    "3.,width=283 ]    in contradistinction to the @xmath0wave superconductivity , the diamagnetic pair breaking is of minor importance in the case of @xmath2pairing .",
    "this feature is responsible for extremely high values of @xmath42 in the absence of zeeman term .",
    "experimental investigations@xcite show that the pseudogap closing field scales linearly with @xmath3 . in ref .",
    "@xcite the value of the scaling factor has been interpreted in favor of the zeeman coupling as a mechanism that closes the pseudogap .",
    "this pair breaking mechanism dominates also in the case of @xmath2pairing .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated the pk model with attractive as well as repulsive pair hopping interaction .",
    "we have shown that the repulsive pair hopping term may lead to the occurrence of local minimum in the density of states , that is characteristic for pseudogap phase of underdoped cuprates .",
    "it originates from the spitting of the quasiparticle peaks . despite the on  site pairing",
    "the magnitude of the splitting is a direction ",
    "dependent quantity , provided that @xmath37 .",
    "anisotropy of the pseudogap is observed in arpes experiments.@xcite we have also calculated the temperature dependence of @xmath42 , defined as the highest magnetic field for which there exists a non  zero solution for the order parameter .",
    "we have found that in the case of @xmath2type pairing @xmath52 reproduces the experimental data for the pseudogap closing field .",
    "these features do not occur for attractive pair hopping interaction . in this case",
    "the gap structure as well as @xmath52 are similar to those obtained for ah model .",
    "our approach to the critical field accounts both for zeeman and diamagnetic pair breaking mechanisms . in the case of @xmath0wave pairing inclusion of the zeeman coupling does not lead to any essential changes in @xmath52 . on the other hand ,",
    "zeeman term is of crucial importance for @xmath2pairing , whereas the diamagnetic pair breaking is ineffective .",
    "according to the experimental data the pseudogap is closed by the zeeman splitting .",
    "as we have previously@xcite shown , other models appropriate for short coherence superconductors have ground states ( with @xmath0wave or @xmath1wave symmetry ) that are almost insensitive to the zeeman interaction .",
    "therefore , the pk model with @xmath27 is unique in that the gap is closed predominantly due to the zeeman interaction .    collecting the features : the presence of the pseudogap , its anisotropy , zeeman origin of @xmath42 ( in agreement with the experimental data )",
    ", the presence of flux quantization and the meissner effect , ( consistent with the preformed cooper pairs scenario ) , may lead to a tempting hypothesis that the pair hopping can be responsible for the pseudogap .",
    "however , in order to avoid the problem of interpretation of the critical field , it should be verified beyond the mean  field level , discussed in this paper .",
