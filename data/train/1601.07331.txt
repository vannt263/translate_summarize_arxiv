    "transition metal compounds ( tmcs ) , particularly in their nanostructured form , find applications in a diverse range of technological fields including photovoltaics and photocatalysis , magnetic storage and phosphorescent imaging.@xcite rational optimization of tmcs at the nanoscale requires an atomistic , quantum - mechanical description of these materials , which in principle can be provided by density - functional theory ( dft).@xcite unfortunately , the most widely - used approximations to the dft exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy , namely the local - density and generalized - gradient approximations ( lda / gga ) , have difficulty in describing the localized @xmath1-electrons of the transition metals.@xcite    this difficulty has been ascribed to the unphysical self - interaction experienced by the electrons within the lda / gga , and a number of methods have been proposed to overcome it.@xcite one popular method is to supplement the lda / gga xc potential with orbital - dependent @xmath0 terms , designed to more accurately describe the on - site correlation of the @xmath1-electrons.@xcite such `` hubbard @xmath0 '' corrections have been found to give an improved description of the properties of tmcs like nio.@xcite    a less widely - investigated approach to improving the lda / gga description of the tmcs is to obtain the xc energy as a combination of the `` exact '' hartree - fock exchange energy ( exx ) and the correlation energy calculated within the random - phase approximation ( rpa).@xcite such a scheme should benefit from the exx correction of self - interaction,@xcite and also from the non - local and dynamical description of correlation provided by the rpa .",
    "specifically , the rpa correlation energy should capture long - range dispersive interactions that are missing in the hubbard @xmath0 corrections.@xcite recent work has demonstrated the good performance of the rpa+exx approach for calculating the formation energies and relative stabilities of transition metal oxides.@xcite    from the point of view of performing predictive calculations , the rpa+exx scheme carries the additional advantage of being essentially parameter - free .",
    "however , it is important to note that the most well - documented successes of this scheme for instance in describing non - local correlation in weakly - bonded systems , describing chemisorption and bonding in solids , or in the tmc examples above  were performed non - self - consistently.@xcite that is , the xc potential felt by the non - interacting electrons was not the functional derivative of the xc energy , at variance with the standard kohn - sham ( ks ) formulation of dft.@xcite    although self - consistent rpa calculations have been demonstrated , they remain a significant technical challenge.@xcite therefore a key question to ask is how the choice of xc potential in the single - particle hamiltonian affects the total energy calculated in a non - self - consistent rpa+exx scheme .",
    "an analogy can be drawn with one - shot calculations of quasiparticle energies within the @xmath3 approximation ( @xmath4 ) , where the green s function and screened coulomb interaction are usually constructed from lda / gga wavefunctions.@xcite here it has been established that the calculated quasiparticle energies ( e.g.  the band gap ) can depend strongly on the xc potential used in the single - particle hamiltonian.@xcite    studies which have explored this aspect for rpa+exx total energy calculations have usually focused on the differences between lda and gga or on the effect of including hartree - fock exchange.@xcite in most cases , the initial choice of xc potential has been found to play only a minor role ; a notable exception is the study of cerium in ref  , and of molecular dissociation in refs .  and  .",
    "however , for tmcs it is natural to investigate the effect on the rpa+exx total energy of adding hubbard @xmath0 corrections to the xc potential .",
    "since such corrections can significantly change the character of the single - particle wavefunctions and their energy eigenvalues , one might expect to observe a dependence of the rpa+exx total energy on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , one might even hope that including hubbard @xmath0 corrections in the xc potential might improve the quality of the subsequent rpa+exx calculation , if the resulting single - particle wavefunctions are closer to the exact ks form.@xcite on the other hand , it is important to note that the orbital - dependent hubbard @xmath0 corrections are non - local , and that the rpa correlation energy is strictly non - variational with respect to all possible non - local xc potentials.@xcite    motivated by these considerations , we have performed a systematic study of the effects of hubbard @xmath0 corrections on the non - self - consistent rpa+exx total energy of tmcs .",
    "we present results for zns , tio@xmath2 and nio which , in terms of their 3@xmath1 states , display progressively more complex electronic structure . from the total energies we obtain lattice constants as a function of the @xmath0 parameter within the rpa approximation for the correlation energy , and compare the results to non - self - consistent exx , self - consistent gga+@xmath0 or lda+@xmath0 , and experiment .",

    "the procedure outlined in the previous section of calculating @xmath40 leads to an ambiguity in the definition of the single - particle hamiltonian @xmath11 . as mentioned above ,",

    "however such an approach relies on having the exact @xmath45 , which is unfortunately not known .",
    "an alternative approach is to treat the combined quantity @xmath47 as an orbital - dependent xc - functional , and use a kohn - sham hamiltonian in equation  [ eq.hks ] with an xc potential constructed as a functional derivative , @xmath48 .",

    "<S> in non - self - consistent calculations of the total energy within the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) for electronic correlation , it is necessary to choose a single - particle hamiltonian whose solutions are used to construct the electronic density and non - interacting response function . </S>",
    "<S> here we investigate the effect of including a hubbard-@xmath0 term in this single - particle hamiltonian , to better describe the on - site correlation of 3@xmath1 electrons in the transition metal compounds zns , tio@xmath2 and nio . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rpa lattice constants are essentially independent of @xmath0 , despite large changes in the underlying electronic structure . </S>",
    "<S> we further demonstrate that the non - self - consistent rpa total energies of these materials have minima at nonzero @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> our rpa calculations find the rutile phase of tio@xmath2 to be more stable than anatase independent of @xmath0 , a result which is consistent with experiments and qualitatively different to that found from calculations employing @xmath0-corrected ( semi)local functionals . </S>",
    "<S> however we also find that the + @xmath0 term can not be used to correct the rpa s poor description of the heat of formation of nio . </S>"
