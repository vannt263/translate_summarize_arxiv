    "recent advances in the experimental and theoretical investigation of the casimir effect suggest that this field of research is important for both fundamental and applied physics",
    ". the casimir force , which acts between two uncharged plates in vacuum , is a purely quantum effect caused by the alteration of the zero - point oscillations of the electromagnetic field due to boundaries @xcite . the modern stage in casimir research originated in a number of measurements of the casimir force between metals ( see @xcite and review @xcite ) .",
    "additional motivation for studying the casimir force comes from promising applications of these results in both fundamental physics ( for constraining hypothetical long - range interactions @xcite ) , and in nanotechnology @xcite .",
    "recently the casimir - polder force has attracted attention @xcite in connection with experiments on quantum reflection and bose - einstein condensation .",
    "as often happens , experimental progress placed more stringent demands upon theoretical calculations of the casimir force . at present , to achieve an agreement between theory and experiment at the level of 1% of the measured force , special care must be taken to account for all relevant factors , such as the finite conductivity of the metallic boundaries , the effect of thermal corrections , surface roughness , grain structure of the covering layers , and patch potentials .",
    "these are reviewed in @xcite , and more recently in @xcite which is devoted to the application of these questions to casimir force measurements between gold surfaces by means of an atomic force microscope @xcite .",
    "the basic theoretical formalism for the calculation of the van der waals and casimir forces between real materials is given by lifshitz theory @xcite .",
    "beginning in 2000 , several research groups applied this theory to the case of real metals at nonzero temperature and four different approaches were proposed . in the first approach @xcite the zero - frequency contribution to the lifshitz formula was determined by the use of the drude dielectric function .",
    "the second approach @xcite modified the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula to make it the same for ideal and real metals . in the third approach",
    "@xcite the lifshitz formula was combined with the free electron plasma model neglecting relaxation .",
    "finally , in @xcite a fourth approach was proposed in which the lifshitz formula at nonzero temperature is rederived using the leontovich surface impedance boundary conditions rather than the bulk dielectric permittivity . within this last approach @xcite , the zero - frequency term of the lifshitz formula",
    "is determined by the form of the leontovich impedance valid near the characteristic frequency .",
    "detailed discussions of the advantages and disadvantages of each of proposed approaches can be found in @xcite .",
    "these discussions are part of a broader context connected with the fundamental nature of the zero - point oscillations and their relation to basic physical principles such as the laws of thermodynamics . in particular",
    ", it has been shown @xcite that the first and second theoretical approaches to the description of the thermal casimir force between real metals lead to a violation of the third law of thermodynamics ( the nernst heat theorem ) in the case of perfect crystals .",
    "the attempt made in @xcite to avoid this conclusion in the framework of the first approach required the introduction of defects and impurities to the crystal , which can not be considered as satisfactory since the perfect crystal forms the basis of the theory of electron - phonon interactions .",
    "it follows that any formalism applied to perfect crystals must satisfy the third law of thermodynamics , which the formulations of the first approach do not .",
    "we consider now a comparison of the different theoretical approaches with experiment .",
    "it should be noted that the third and fourth approaches predict small thermal corrections to the casimir force at short separations of order 100 nm , in qualitative agreement with the case of an ideal metal , whereas the first and second approaches lead to thermal corrections which are many times greater @xcite .",
    "however , taking into account the small magnitude of the casimir force , reliably distinguishing among the different predicted thermal corrections presents a serious challenge to experimental physics . in this regard",
    "it is important that the first approach ( see @xcite and also @xcite ) disagrees significantly @xcite with the most famous modern measurement of the casimir force between au surfaces by means of a torsion pendulum @xcite .",
    "a net deviation from zero temperature casimir force is predicted by the first approach to be about 25% at a separation @xmath4 nm . it was not , however , observed @xcite despite the fact that the experimental uncertainty was less than 10% .",
    "the most precise and accurate measurement of the casimir force to date was made between two dissimilar metals ( cu and au ) by means of a microelectromechanical torsional oscillator @xcite . in that experiment",
    "the casimir force between a plate and a sphere was measured statically , and the effective casimir pressure between two parallel plates was determined dynamically , with an absolute error of @xmath5mpa at 95% confidence .",
    "the estimated theoretical uncertainty in @xcite was approximately 1% of the casimir pressure over the entire measurement range .",
    "this was , however , a purely theoretical error which did not take into account errors in the theoretical pressure induced by uncertainties in the experimental determination of the sphere - plate separations .",
    "( recall that a micromachined oscillator was first used in @xcite to demonstrate a micromechanical device driven entirely by the casimir force . ) the experimental data in @xcite were not precise enough to observe the traditional thermal corrections of the third and fourth approaches .",
    "however , the comparison of these data with theory demonstrates that the alternative thermal corrections to the casimir pressure , as predicted in the first @xcite and second @xcite approaches , are excluded by experiment within a wide separation region .",
    "the good agreement between theory ( based on the surface impedance approach ) and experiment was used in @xcite to obtain stronger constraints on hypothetical long - range interactions predicted by many extensions to the standard model of fundamental interactions .    in this paper",
    "we present the results of an improved experimental determination of the casimir pressure reported in @xcite , and of a refined comparison of these new results with all four theoretical approaches .",
    "the following modifications in the experimental setup allowed us to obtain results exceeding those of @xcite in both reliability and conclusiveness .",
    "the main improvement is associated with a considerable decrease of the surface roughness on both the plate and the sphere . in @xcite",
    "the highest roughness peaks were as much as @xmath6 nm in height on both bodies .",
    "in the improved experiment the maximum heights of the roughness peaks are 11.06 nm on the sphere and 20.63 nm on the plate .",
    "an improvement in detection sensitivity , together with a reduction of the coupling between the micromachined oscillator and the environment , yielded measurements at smaller separations between the test bodies ( 160 nm instead of 260 nm ) .",
    "another important improvement was the reduction of the error in determining the absolute separation between the sphere and the top of the metal - coated plate from 1 nm in @xcite to 0.6 nm .",
    "a special experimental study was performed to ensure the linearity of the microelectromechanical torsional oscillator .",
    "in addition au was used as a covering layer on both the plate and the sphere ( instead of cu and au , respectively , as in @xcite ) , which permits a more reliable theoretical interpretation of the experimental results .",
    "the refined theory includes a complete analysis of the finite conductivity , surface roughness , and thermal corrections to the casimir pressure .",
    "in contrast to @xcite , the finite conductivity corrections are analyzed by taking into account the grain structure of the covering layers , possible sample - to - sample variations of the tabulated optical data , and the contribution of nonlocal effects .",
    "the roughness analysis incorporates non - multiplicative , diffraction - type and correlation effects .",
    "it is shown that in the present experiment the maximum value of the roughness correction , which is achieved at a separation of 160 nm , is only 0.65% of the casimir pressure .",
    "thermal casimir pressures are computed in the framework of all four theoretical approaches .",
    "a special metrological analysis has been performed separately for the experimental data and for the results of the theoretical computations .",
    "the random , systematic , and total experimental errors are found as functions of separation , taking into account the distribution laws for each error at the 95% confidence level .",
    "a careful comparison between experiment and theory has been carried out taking into account all experimental and theoretical errors .",
    "this comparison is based on rigorous metrological criteria which do not use the concept of the root - mean - square deviation between theory and experiment over the entire separation range , a procedure that had been criticized in literature @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the alternative thermal corrections to the casimir pressure , as proposed in the first @xcite and second @xcite approaches , are excluded by experiment , whereas the third @xcite and fourth @xcite approaches are shown to be consistent with experiment .",
    "these results confirm those obtained earlier in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we also improve the constraints on hypothetical long - range interactions obtained in @xcite . by combining the results of this paper and @xcite ,",
    "the previously known constraints are strengthened by a factor of up to 20 in a wide interaction region around 0.1@xmath7 m .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "the experimental configuration and sample characterization are briefly described .",
    "section 3 contains the calibration procedure and the experimental results for the casimir pressure . in section 4 the metrological analysis of these results",
    "is performed and the experimental errors are found at 95% confidence . in section 5",
    "we calculate the casimir pressure between au layers in the framework of the four approaches described above taking into account different kinds of corrections .",
    "section 6 is devoted to a metrological analysis of the theoretical uncertainties . in section 7",
    "all four theoretical approaches to the thermal casimir force are compared with the experimental data .",
    "the level of agreement between experiment and theory is used to obtain stronger constraints on hypothetical long - range interactions in section 8 .",
    "we conclude in section 9 with a discussion of our results .",
    "the general scheme of the experimental setup used to determine the casimir interaction between two bodies by means of a micromachined oscillator was described previously in @xcite .",
    "one of the new features of the present experiment is the fact that here the casimir attraction is measured between two layers of au , specifically , a au - coated sapphire sphere and a au - coated polysilicon microelectromechanical torsional oscillator ( mto ) . to improve the force sensitivity ,",
    "the vertical separation between the sphere and the plate was changed harmonically with time , leading to a measurement of the @xmath8-derivative of the casimir force .",
    "as described in @xcite , this is equivalent to measuring the casimir force per unit area , or the casimir pressure , for a configuration of two parallel plates ( see below ) .",
    "the mto presents a low coupling with the environment , since it is less sensitive to modes that involve a displacement of the center of mass .",
    "the miniaturization also allows us to achieve a large quality factor @xmath9 .",
    "the experimental arrangement is shown schematically in fig .",
    "the mto is made of a 3.5@xmath7 m thick , 500@xmath10 500@xmath7m@xmath11 heavily doped polysilicon plate suspended at two opposite points by serpentine springs .",
    "two independently contacted polysilicon electrodes located under the plate are used to induce an oscillation on the plate at the required resonant frequency of the mto .",
    "a 80 @xmath7 m wide ribbon at the edge of the plate was coated with 10 nm of pt followed by 150 nm of au .",
    "the au layer constitutes one of the metals used in the measurement of the casimir interaction .",
    "the separation between the two au layers is given by @xmath12 in this expression @xmath13 is the separation between the end of the cleaved fiber and the platform , as interferometrically measured with the absolute error @xmath14 nm .",
    "@xmath15 , where @xmath16 represents the separation between the platform and the top of the au - coated plate when the interaction between the sphere and the plate is negligible ( i.e. , @xmath17 ) , and @xmath18 is the distance between the end of the bottom of the cleaved fiber and the external surface of the au film on the au - coated sphere ( see fig .  1 ) . the lever arm @xmath19 m",
    "is determined optically .",
    "the value of @xmath20 is determined by measuring the difference in capacitance between the plate and the right and left electrodes @xmath21 . in all reported cases @xmath22rad .",
    "a field effect transistor ( fet ) , the first stage in the amplifier circuit , was placed as close as possible to the oscillator to minimize the effect of parasitic capacitances .",
    "the smallest angular deviation that can be detected in this configuration is given by    @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the minimum detectable change in @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the capacitance between the oscillator and each electrode when no forces are present ( @xmath27 is the permittivity of free space ) .",
    "the dimensions of the electrodes are @xmath28 m , @xmath29 m , and @xmath30 m is the separation between the plate and the electrodes .",
    "@xmath31 20pf @xmath32 is the parasitic capacitance of the measurement circuit ( determined by the capacitance of the fet transistor plus parasitic capacitances to ground ) , @xmath33nv / hz@xmath34 is the input noise of the amplifier , @xmath35 is the bandwidth of the measurement , and @xmath36 1 v is the dc potential used to correct for initial asymmetries in the circuit and to linearize its response . in obtaining eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) parallel plate approximations , and the fact that the maximum angular deviation @xmath37 , have been used . in the relevant @xmath38hz range ,",
    "actual measurements of @xmath24 coincide within 15% with those predicted by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "a sphere with a nominal radius @xmath39 m was coated with a 10 nm layer of ti followed by a 200 nm layer of au .",
    "for both the plate of the mto and the sphere , vacuum was not interrupted in between depositions .",
    "deposition induced asymmetries in the sphere were found to be smaller than 10 nm , the resolution of the scanning electron microscope ( sem ) used to characterize them .",
    "the entire setup ( mto and fiber - sphere ) was rigidly mounted into a can which was hung inside a vacuum chamber by means of soft springs .",
    "a built - in magnetic damping vibration isolation helped in reducing the coupling with the main resonance of the building , occurring at 7hz .",
    "finally , the vacuum chamber was , in turn , mounted onto an air table .",
    "this combination of vibration isolation systems yielded peak - to - peak vibrations with @xmath40 nm ( the detection limit in our accelerometer ) for frequencies above 100hz . to reduce the damping in the mto",
    ", the vacuum chamber was initially evacuated to a pressure less than @xmath41torr . in order to reduce external vibrations ,",
    "the chamber was then closed , the pumping station removed , and the vacuum lines disconnected .",
    "the pressure was kept low during the experiment by means of a chemical pump , made of a cold ( @xmath42k ) activated carbon trap located inside the vacuum chamber .",
    "a pressure @xmath43torr was maintained with this setup for the length of each experimental run .",
    "when necessary , the vacuum chamber was re - evacuated between runs .      before performing the casimir interaction measurements ,",
    "the sample was characterized using an atomic force microscope ( afm ) .",
    "this serves the double purpose of determining the roughness of the sample and also , by repeating the afm study _",
    "after _ the casimir measurements , to check that the sample was not modified during the measurement .",
    "the afm images were obtained for both the plate and the sphere .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "it is not possible for us to ensure that the region shown in fig .",
    "[ afm]a and fig .  [ afm]b ( before and after the measurements , respectively ) is exactly the one giving the dominant contribution to the interaction with the sphere .",
    "we note , however , that we imaged with the afm a region of @xmath44 , located at the center of the au - coated region of the plate , and fig .",
    "[ afm]a represents just a fraction of this region .",
    "the remainder of the investigated region , however , shows a very similar behavior , with identical topography except for two dust particles observed . for the sphere",
    "it is easier to find the interacting area since the fiber itself provides a preferential direction .",
    "[ afm]c and [ afm]d show afm images of the bottom of the sphere , obtained before and after the experiment . as in the case of the plate , there are no discernible modifications in the topography .",
    "it is worth mentioning that a spherical surface of radius @xmath45 was first subtracted from the data shown in fig .",
    "[ afm]c and fig .  [ afm]d . for all cases shown in fig .",
    "[ afm ] an extra planarization was performed to account for the small non - linearities of the _ z_-axis of the afm s translational stage .",

    "[ f3 ] permits us to estimate the correlation length of surface roughness ( see section 5.4 ) .",
    "these afm images were used to characterize the roughness of the sample , which has to be taken into account when comparing the measured casimir interaction with the theoretical predictions . as was done in @xcite , the roughness",
    "is represented by the fraction @xmath49 of the sample with height @xmath50 .",

    "evidently @xmath59 and @xmath60 . the data of figs .",
    "4a and 4b will be used in section 5.4 for the calculation of the roughness corrections to the casimir pressure . as was noted in the introduction ,",
    "the surface roughness was considerably decreased compared with @xcite .",

    "the electrostatic force @xmath64 between the plate and the sphere was measured as a function of the separation @xmath8 for @xmath65 m , where the casimir force is smaller than 0.1% of the total force .",
    "this measurement was repeated for different potential differences between the plate and the sphere . for a given potential difference",
    ", @xmath64 between a sphere and an infinite plane is given by @xcite    @xmath66    here @xmath67 is the voltage applied to the sphere , @xmath68 is the residual potential difference between the metallic layers when they are both grounded , and @xmath69 $ ] . fig .",
    "[ deltav ] shows the dependence of @xmath20 ( and hence the electrostatic force ) on the applied voltage @xmath67 .",

    "( [ eqe1 ] ) we found that @xmath70n within the experimental uncertainty for @xmath71mv .",
    "@xmath68 represents the difference in work functions between the au layer on the plate and the sphere , along the path that closes the electric circuit between them .",
    "this value was observed to be constant for @xmath8 in the ( 0.155)@xmath7 m range , and it did not vary when measured over different locations in the au layer on the plate .",
    "note that @xmath72 is measured between the zero roughness levels on a plate and a sphere relative to which the mean values of roughness profiles are zero ( see also section 5.4 ) . as a result , the absolute separations from eq .",
    "( [ e0 ] ) are also determined between the zero roughness levels .",
    "for this reason , there is no systematic error due to roughness in the measurements of separations in addition to uncertainties discussed in section 4.1 below .    a set of 120 curves of @xmath73",
    "was then used to fit for the parameter @xmath15 ( the error on @xmath74 was originally estimated to be no smaller than 50 nm ) . to check the stability of the system , a subset of these curves ( typically 30 of them )",
    "was repeated after each set of the separation dependence measurements , @xmath75 , of the casimir interaction .",
    "three curves for different @xmath76 are shown in fig .",
    "the local @xmath45 in the configuration when the sphere and the plane are interacting , and the proportionality factor @xmath77 between the measured @xmath78 and @xmath20 , are also obtained through the measured @xmath73 .",
    "finally , the following values of all three parameters were determined : @xmath79 nm , @xmath80 m , and @xmath81n / f . the determination of @xmath74 and the measurement of @xmath20 then yield @xmath8 when @xmath13 is measured interferometrically .      as in @xcite ,",
    "the most sensitive measurement of the casimir interaction arises from measuring the change of the angular resonant frequency @xmath82 of the oscillator in the presence of vacuum fluctuations .",

    ", @xmath93 should be as large as possible to minimize @xmath94 .",

    "this is approximately a factor of 1.7 smaller than in our previous work @xcite , the main reasons being a better decoupling of the apparatus from the environmental noise , and an improvement in the amplifier to measure @xmath25 .",

    "below we will use the confidence level @xmath108% which results in @xmath109 @xcite . substituting this into eq .",
    "( [ e5 ] ) we conclude that the absolute separations are measured with an error @xmath110 nm .",
    "as mentioned in section 3.2 , the casimir pressure was measured 15 times over the 160 nm to 750 nm separation region ( with 288 to 293 points in each set of measurements ) .",
    "it is not trivial , however , to take advantage of the fifteen - fold repetition of the measurement in order to decrease the random error and to narrow the confidence interval .",
    "the difficulty is that in the measurement procedure employed the separation step between any two neighboring points was not uniform , even in one set of measurements , and additionally was quite different in all sets of the data .",
    "this leads to an absence of even a few points ( let alone fifteen ) taken at the same separation which could thus be used for averaging in a statistical analysis .",
    "the usual way to deal with such data is the following : the entire separation range under consideration ( from 160 nm to 750 nm ) is divided into partial subintervals of length @xmath111 nm each .",
    "all points from each set of measurements are plotted together on this interval and , as a result , each subinterval @xmath112 contains a group of a few points @xmath113 ( in our case from 3 to 13 ) . inside each subinterval",
    "all points can be considered as equivalent because the value of the absolute separation is distributed uniformly within the limits of @xmath114 .",
    "we note that the experimental points used should be checked for the presence of so called `` outlying '' results . for this purpose inside of each subinterval @xmath112",
    "it is necessary to consider the quantity @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the value of the casimir pressure at point number @xmath117 of the subinterval @xmath112 ( @xmath118 , maximum is taken with respect to @xmath117 ) .",
    "the mean and the variance of the pressure are respectively defined as @xmath119 if the inequality @xmath120 is satisfied , where @xmath121 are tabulated quantities , then the subinterval @xmath112 contains an outlying result , which should be rejected with a confidence probability @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "the 15 available sets of measurements were analyzed using this criterion and one set of measurements was found to be outlying .",
    "the subintervals containing points of this set satisfy the above inequality with high probability @xmath122 . as an example , at separations 170 nm , 174 nm , 180 nm and 250 nm the probabilities that the points of the rejected set are outlying are 80% , 98% , 95% , and 98% , respectively . for this reason in the subsequent analysis",
    "we only consider data from 14 sets of measurements which were confirmed not to be outlying .",
    "direct calculation shows that data from these 14 measurement sets consist of groups ( belonging to the neighboring subintervals ) which are uniform in mean values .",
    "this implies that the mean casimir pressures @xmath123 change smoothly in going from group ( subinterval ) @xmath112 to group ( subinterval ) @xmath124 .",
    "the variance , however , turned out not to be uniform in going from one subinterval to another . for this case",
    "we have utilized the theory of repeated measurements to implement a special procedure @xcite . at each separation distance @xmath125 , in order to find the uniform variance of a mean , it is necessary to consider not only one subinterval ( which covers the value of @xmath125 ) but also several neighboring subintervals to the left and to the right of @xmath125 ( in our case usually 4 or 5 ) as well .",
    "the specific number of such subintervals @xmath126 is determined from the requirement that the variance of the mean computed over several subintervals be uniform in going to the next set of subintervals .",
    "mathematically the confidence interval at some fixed separation @xmath125 is found in the following way .",
    "we calculate the variance of the mean of the casimir pressure in each subinterval @xmath112 ( @xmath127 ) chosen around @xmath125 , @xmath128 then the variance of the mean at a point @xmath125 is found via the equation @xcite @xmath129 , \\label{e9}\\ ] ] where @xmath130 are the influence coefficients .",
    "the maximum is taken over two sets of influence coefficients , @xmath131 , and @xmath132 with the constants @xmath133 determined from @xmath134 the confidence interval at a confidence probability @xmath122 @xmath135 \\label{e11}\\ ] ] can then be found where @xmath136 here @xmath137 is obtained from the tabulated values for the student s @xmath138 distribition ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the calculated results for @xmath139 over the entire interval ( 160750)nm at @xmath140 confidence are shown in fig .",
    "9a by the long - dashed line .",

    "thus , the second theoretical approach is also excluded experimentally at 95% confidence .",
    "finally , the strong agreement between experiment and traditional theory of the casimir force was used to obtain more stringent constraints on the hypothetical yukawa - type interactions predicted in high energy physics . using the results of two experiments ( this one and of @xcite ) the constraints on @xmath359 as a function of @xmath360",

    "<S> we report an improved dynamic determination of the casimir pressure @xmath0 between two plane plates obtained using a micromachined torsional oscillator . </S>",
    "<S> the main improvements in the current experiment are a significant suppression of the surface roughness of the au layers deposited on the interacting surfaces , and a decrease by a factor of 1.7 ( down to 0.6 nm ) in the experimental error in the measurement of the absolute separation . </S>",
    "<S> a metrological analysis of all data for @xmath0 from 15 sets of measurements permitted us to determine both the random and systematic errors , and to find the total experimental error in @xmath0 as a function of separation at the 95% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to all previous experiments on the casimir effect , where a small relative error was achieved only at the shortest separation , our smallest experimental error ( @xmath1% ) is achieved over a wide separation range . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical casimir pressures @xmath2 in the experimental configuration were calculated by the use of four theoretical approaches suggested in the literature based on the lifshitz formula at nonzero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> all corrections to the casimir force due to grain structure of the overlying metal layers ( including the variation of optical data and patch potentials ) , surface roughness ( including nonmultiplicative and diffraction - type effects ) , and nonlocal effects , were calculated or estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of the roughness correction , achieved at the shortest separation of 160 nm , is equal to only 0.65% of the casimir pressure . </S>",
    "<S> all theoretical errors , including those introduced by the proximity force theorem , finite size of the plate area , and uncertainties in the experimental separations , were analyzed and metrologically combined to obtain the total theoretical error at the 95% confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the confidence interval for @xmath3 was obtained as a function of separation . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements are found to be consistent with two theoretical approaches utilizing the plasma model and the surface impedance over the entire measurement region from 160 nm to 750 nm . </S>",
    "<S> two other approaches to the thermal casimir force , utilizing the drude model or a special prescription for the determination of the zero - frequency contribution to the lifshitz formula , are excluded on the basis of our measurements at the 99% and 95% confidence levels , respectively . finally , constraints on yukawa - type hypothetical interactions are strengthened by up to a factor of 20 in a wide interaction range .    12.20.fv , 12.20.ds , 42.50.lc , 03.70.+k casimir force ; thermal corrections ; lifshitz formula ; yukawa - type interaction </S>"
