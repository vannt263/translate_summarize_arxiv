    "roberts method shows that the figure eight orbit is linearly stable .",
    "the method uses the symmetries to factor a matrix similar to the monodromy matrix for the periodic orbit into an integer power of the product of two involutions .",
    "one of the two involutions depends on the linearized dynamics along only a part of the periodic orbit . for the figure eight",
    "this part is one - tweltfth of the full orbit since it has a symmetry group isomorphic to the group @xmath0 of order @xmath1 .",
    "( here the dihedral group @xmath2 is the group of symmetries of the regular @xmath3-gon . )",
    "the eigenvalues of the product of the two involutions are then reduced to the numerical computation of a few real numbers .",

    "the regularization of these singular periodic orbits is achieved by a generalized levi - civita type transformation and an appropriate scaling of time , as adapted from aarseth and zare @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we apply the method of roberts to prove the linear stability of the schubart - like orbit in the symmetric collinear four body @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 problem for certain values of @xmath5 , and of the singular periodic orbit in the symmetric planar equal mass problem . in both settings ,",
    "the linear stability is determined for the regularized equations only and is reduced to the rigorous numerical computation of a single real number .",
    "our linear stability analysis determines values of @xmath5 in the interval @xmath8 $ ] in the collinear problem for which the singular periodic orbit is linear stable , and also shows that the @xmath9 singular periodic orbit is linear stable .",
