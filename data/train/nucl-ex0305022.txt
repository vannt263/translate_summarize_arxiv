    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) is a heavy water cherenkov detector which was built to understand why all previous solar neutrino experiments @xcite have observed fewer neutrinos than are predicted by generally accepted solar models @xcite .",
    "the snodetector is described in detail elsewhere @xcite .",
    "briefly , snoconsists of an inner neutrino target of 1000  tonnes of ultra - pure d@xmath0o contained in a 12  m diameter spherical , transparent , acrylic vessel .",
    "an array of 9438 photomultiplier tubes , mounted on an @xmath218  m diameter stainless steel geodesic support structure , detect the cherenkov light from electrons produced by neutrino interactions in the d@xmath0o .",
    "the volume between the acrylic vessel and the tube support structure contains approximately 1700  tonnes of ultra - pure h@xmath0o which shields the d@xmath0ovolume from high - energy @xmath5  rays produced by radioactivity in the outer regions of the detector .",
    "outside the photomultipliers lie an additional 5700  tonnes of h@xmath0oshielding . the two water shielding regions are separated by a nearly impermeable water seal which serves to keep the water in the outer shielding area , which has higher radon levels , isolated from the water between the photomultipliers and the acrylic vessel , where the radon level is lower .",
    "the external water shielding region is viewed by 91  outward - looking photomultiplier tubes which help to reject background from muons traversing the detector .",
    "the detector is situated in the inco , ltd .",
    "creighton mine , in sudbury , ontario , canada . at a depth of 6800 feet ,",
    "only about 70  muons interact in the detector per day .",
    "snodetects solar neutrinos through three distinguishable interactions with the d@xmath0o target :    _ & +   ^- + + & + _ x & +   _ x + + & + _ x & + ^- _ x + ^- &    where @xmath6 denotes any of the active neutrino species @xmath7 .",
    "the cc reaction is only sensitive to the flux of electron neutrinos , whereas the nc reaction is equally sensitive to all active neutrino flavors .",
    "three techniques have been developed to observe the neutrons from the nc reaction in sno . in the first phase of the experiment , the inner vessel was filled with pure d@xmath0o .",
    "the neutrons were captured by deuterium nuclei creating 6.25-mev @xmath5  rays which interacted to make relativistic electrons whose cherenkov light was detected . in the second phase , nacl was added to the d@xmath0o .",
    "most neutrons then capture on @xmath8cl , an exothermic reaction that yields photons whose energies sum to 8.6  mev . in the third phase , the salt will be removed and neutrons will be detected with low - background @xmath9he - filled counters that will be installed in the d@xmath0o .",
    "the first publication @xcite of snoresults indicated that the flux of electron neutrinos with energy @xmath106.75  mev inferred from the cc reaction is not as large as the total rate inferred from the es reaction as measured by sno , or with greater accuracy , by super - kamiokande @xcite .",
    "since the es reaction is mostly sensitive to the flux of electron neutrinos , but has a small contribution from the flux of other neutrino flavors , this implies that the flux of active neutrinos from the sun is greater than the observed flux of electron neutrinos alone . as only electron neutrinos are produced in the sun , this observation is evidence that electron neutrinos have transformed into some combination of @xmath11 and @xmath12 neutrinos by the time they reach the detector .",
    "a much higher precision measurement of this phenomenon was obtained by a comparison at energies @xmath105  mev of the cc and nc rates in the snodetector @xcite and their temporal variations @xcite . to make this comparison required that the radioactive backgrounds in the detector were well understood , since decays of progeny of @xmath13u ( `` u - chain '' ) and progeny of @xmath14th ( `` th - chain '' ) can mimic the neutrino interactions .",
    "the isotopes of most concern for the cc / nc comparison are in the u - chain and in the th - chain because their decays can produce @xmath5  rays with energies greater than 2.2  mev .",
    "these high - energy @xmath5  rays can photodisintegrate the deuteron , producing a free neutron , and thus mimic the nc disintegration of the deuteron .",
    "two techniques , which are discussed elsewhere @xcite , have been developed to measure the aqueous concentration of @xmath15ra from the u - chain and @xmath16ra from the th - chain .",
    "these give a good measurement of the concentration of radium ions in the water .",
    "knowledge of the @xmath15ra concentration is , however , not sufficient to determine the u - chain radioactive background because @xmath17rn , the decay product of @xmath15ra , is a noble gas with a 3.8-d half - life .",
    "small leaks of air and traces of radium in detector materials can introduce @xmath17rn , and lead to significant disequilibria between @xmath15ra and @xmath18bi . to properly understand the radioactive background , it is thus imperative to measure directly the @xmath17rn concentration in the water as only isotopes with short half - lives separate from the undesired @xmath18bi .",
    "the underground air at the snolaboratory contains @xmath2100",
    "bq / m@xmath9 of ( 3",
    "pci / l or 50  rn atoms / cm@xmath9 ) , which , if the radon were at its equilibrium concentration with the d@xmath0o , would yield a dissolved level almost @xmath20 times higher than tolerable .",
    "considerable precautions were thus taken in the design and construction of snoto limit the leakage of into the detector . as examples of such measures ,",
    "all components of the water systems were selected for low radon diffusion and emanation , the entire d@xmath0osystem was leak checked with a he mass spectrometer , and one of the final elements of both the h@xmath0oand d@xmath0owater purification systems is a degasser that has a radon removal efficiency of @xmath2190% .",
    "further , the polypropylene pipes in the water system have thick walls and are made with specially selected low - radioactivity material @xcite , all detachable joints are sealed with butyl rubber o - rings @xcite which have low radon permeability and emanation , the detector cavity is lined with a membrane with low rn permeability , and there is a `` cover gas '' , a continuously flowing stream of n@xmath0 from the boiloff of liquid nitrogen , into the vapor space directly above the d@xmath0oand h@xmath0o .",
    "the standard model calculation of the @xmath22b neutrino flux from the sun  @xcite , together with the cross section for the nc reaction @xcite , predicts that 10  to 15  neutrons will be produced by solar neutrinos per day in the 1000  tonnes of d@xmath0oin the snodetector .",
    "based on this prediction , snoset the design goal to have no more than one neutron per day produced in the d@xmath0oby u - chain contamination .",
    "as described in @xcite , this implies that the maximum allowable contamination of the d@xmath0o is @xmath23  g  u / g  d@xmath0o , assuming secular equilibrium between @xmath13u and @xmath18bi .",
    "this can be translated into a maximum concentration for @xmath17rn in the d@xmath0o of about 0.2  atoms / liter or 0.4  mbq / m@xmath9 .",
    "the maximum allowable radon concentrations in the h@xmath0obetween the acrylic vessel and the photomultipliers and in the outer bulk shielding water are given in table  [ tab : goals ] .",
    "at these levels , the background contributed by h@xmath0oto the nc signal is no more than that from the d@xmath0o .",
    "@ l @ d d @ d @ region & & & + d@xmath0o & 0.2 & 0.4 & 3.0 10 ^ -14 + h@xmath0o ( i ) & 3 & 6 & 4.5 10 ^ -13 + h@xmath0o ( o ) & 7 & 14 & 1.1 10 ^ -12 +    to reduce the systematic error in the nc determination that arises from the uncertainty in the radon level to less than a few percent , it is necessary to lower the radon content of the water below the maximum allowable level .",
    "such levels can only be measured with accuracy if the ultimate sensitivity of the assay method is an order of magnitude below the design goal .",
    "as shown below , these requirements were met , thus allowing the critical neutral current measurement to be made with precision .",
    "the assay method operates by pumping water from the detector to a degasser which extracts the radon .",
    "the radon is collected , concentrated , and then transferred to a miniature zns - coated scintillation counter ( a lucas cell  @xcite ) for measurement .",
    "the extraction of radon is performed differently in the h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o systems ; we describe the extraction from h@xmath0o here and from d@xmath0o in sec .",
    "[ sec : d2o ] .",
    "the radon collection and counting are the same in both systems and are discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : rncollect ] and sec .",
    "[ sec : counting ] , respectively .",
    "o and d@xmath0o .",
    "assay points are labelled by the valves that must be opened to extract the water .",
    "most d@xmath0o assays take water from the main purification loop shown on the left side of the acrylic vessel .",
    "this circulation normally draws water from the bottom of the vessel , and , after purification and assay , returns it at the bottom of the vessel neck .",
    "flow in the reverse direction is also possible .",
    "measurements of radon levels are also made occasionally at other locations within the vessel ( v901 , v903 , and v905 ) .",
    "assays of the light water are usually conducted at two positions between the photomultiplier array and the acrylic vessel ( v203 and v206 ) and at the bottom of the cavity ( v202 ) . ]",
    "h@xmath0o can be drawn from six locations in the detector .",
    "two sample points are at the bottom of the cavity , three at the equator of the acrylic vessel , and one at the bottom of the photomultiplier array .",
    "the most commonly sampled h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o positions are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] .",
    "the distance from the sample points to the degasser is about 70  m and the piping is polypropylene with 60  mm outer diameter and 5.5  mm wall thickness .",
    "polypropylene was chosen for its low radioactivity , low leaching of impurities in the presence of ultra - pure water , and low radon permeability .",
    "the water sample is taken by a diaphragm pump @xcite whose wetted portions are made from polypropylene , except for the diaphragm which is teflon . a typical assay samples water for 30  minutes at a flow rate of 19  liters / minute . at the maximum allowable contamination of the h@xmath0o between the acrylic vessel and the photomultipliers ( @xmath25  g  u / g  h@xmath0o ) , this water would contain 1480  @xmath17rn atoms .",
    "the water goes through a vacuum - degassing chamber and is returned to the main h@xmath0o circulation system by another diaphragm pump .",
    "the volume of water is measured with either a rotameter flowmeter or a stroke counter attached to the diaphragm pump .",
    "the volume per stroke is 0.34  liters , and is independent of flow rate over the range of flows normally used .",
    "both of these were calibrated by flowing water from the pump to a container on a scale .",
    "one of the larger sources of systematic uncertainty is the difficulty of accurately measuring the water flow rate from the pulsating diaphragm pump .",
    "the estimated uncertainty is 14% in the flowmeter readings and 10% in the stroke - counted readings .",
    "o system . ]    the monitor degasser ( mdg ) @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : degasser ] .",
    "it is a custom - designed stainless steel vertical cylinder 1.15  m high and 0.4  m in diameter @xcite .",
    "the usual pressure difference between the feed water line and the degassing chamber is 45  psi .",
    "the water enters at the top of the degasser at a temperature of 13@xmath26cand passes through three stainless - steel full - cone spray nozzles @xcite .",
    "the nozzles spray upwards and produce water droplets with a diameter of @xmath21  mm .",
    "as the drops fall , or run down the walls of the degasser chamber , the dissolved gases leave the water and are drawn off to the radon collector described in sec .  [",
    "sec : rncollect ] . the spray and the water level are visible through two acrylic view ports mounted on flanges welded to the side of the vessel .",
    "the water level in the bottom of the degasser is maintained at a height of @xmath20.3  m.    the degassing efficiency of the mdg was measured by bringing a small volume of water into equilibrium with radon in the air of the underground laboratory , injecting this radon - enriched water into the input of the mdg , and then extracting , concentrating , and counting the radon .",
    "the number of detected radon atoms was compared to the number expected based upon the radon solubility , the known radon activity in the air ( measured by introducing a different sample of the same air into an evacuated lucas cell and counting its activity ) , and the known efficiencies of collection and concentration . with h@xmath0o at 13@xmath26cand a flow rate of 19  liters / minute",
    "the degassing efficiency was measured to be @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "although the materials in the assay system were selected for their low diffusion and emanation rates for radon @xcite , some radon can still enter the water being assayed through leaks , by diffusion through pipes , o - rings , etc .",
    ", by emanation from contaminants in assay system components , and by emanation from surface dust , embedded dirt , etc .",
    "the background of the degasser was measured by filling the mdg with water and flowing this water in `` closed loop mode '' ( which sends the output water of the degasser back to its input ) until it was completely degassed .",
    "then several assays of the degassed water were conducted , each of 3-hour duration , at a flow rate of 20  liters / minute . in these experiments @xmath28  atoms of radon entered the system per hour of assay by the combination of leakage , diffusion , and emanation . for a typical 30-min assay",
    "this represents a background of 1.1% of the number of atoms that would be extracted and collected if the water were at the maximum allowable level .",
    "these measurements , however , were only of the mdg and the subsequent radon collection apparatus and did not include the assay system piping that leads to the detector .",
    "furthermore , the background can change as a function of time .",
    "for instance , we find that vibrations may loosen the nuts on valves and flanges , for which we must compensate by periodic tightening .",
    "thus , the background for any given assay may be higher than measured in these closed loop assays , where great care was taken to ensure that the system was tightly sealed . to take account of these additional sources of background , some of which may vary in time , we add onto the previously stated statistical error of @xmath29  atoms / hr an additional systematic error , which we estimate to be @xmath30  atoms / hr . the total assay system background is thus @xmath31  atoms / hr .",
    "the basic principles of the assay system for d@xmath0o are very similar to those for h@xmath0o , namely , degassing followed by radon collection , concentration , and counting . the d@xmath0o system , however",
    ", must be an order of magnitude more sensitive than the h@xmath0o system ( see table  [ tab : goals ] ) , be able to function in 0.2%  nacl - d@xmath0o brine , and , since the d@xmath0o is so valuable , have minimal loss of d@xmath0o vapor .",
    "for these reasons a polypropylene hydrophobic - membrane contact degasser was chosen , rather than a metal vacuum degasser . the system design and calibration is described in more detail in @xcite .",
    "the d@xmath0o can be assayed from seven locations in the detector as well as at points within the water purification system itself .",
    "the most commonly sampled points are labeled in fig .",
    "[ fig : sample ] .",
    "there are five assay positions within the d@xmath0o on the acrylic vessel wall : at the bottom of the vessel ( v901 ) , 1/3 of the way up ( not shown ) , 3/4 of the way up ( v903 ) , at the bottom of the neck ( not shown ) , and 0.3  m below the surface of the water in the neck ( v905 ) .",
    "in addition , the water from the main purification circulation loop can be sampled either at the bottom of the neck ( r967 ) or at the bottom of the vessel ( v967 ) .",
    "the pipes within the vessel are made from the same acrylic as the vessel itself ; outside the vessel the pipes are polypropylene , as in the h@xmath0o system . for the dedicated assay lines ,",
    "a diaphragm pump identical to that used in the h@xmath0o system draws water from the vessel to the d@xmath0o degasser .    a typical assay samples water for 5  hours at 21  liters / min .",
    "at the maximum allowable level this water contains about 1260   atoms , which , taking into account the degassing efficiency and transfer efficiency , results in 480  atoms in the lucas cell at the end of an assay .",
    "since the single-@xmath1 counting efficiency is 74% and 3  prompt alphas are emitted per radon decay ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : lceff ] ) , this gives about 180  events in the first day of counting .",
    "this should be compared with the typical lucas cell background rate of about 10  counts / d , and the background from the assay system , which contributes about 20  counts in the first day of counting . defining the sensitivity as when the signal equals approximately three times the uncertainty of the background @xcite , the sensitivity of the entire d@xmath0o assay system in the current configuration is about one - tenth of the maximum allowable level , or about @xmath32  g  u / g  d@xmath0o .",
    "there is no flow meter in the d@xmath0o radon assay system .",
    "rather , the flow rate is set by adjusting the pump stroke rate to a fixed value .",
    "since the d@xmath0o system uses the same type of diaphragm pump as the h@xmath0o system , we use its calibration , whose uncertainty is 10% . there may , however , be small differences in any two pumps believed to be identical , and thus we add in quadrature an assumed 5% uncertainty , giving a total flow rate uncertainty in stroke - counted experiments of 11% .",
    "some assays were conducted before the installation of the stroke counter ; for these we estimate a 17% uncertainty in the flow rate .",
    "the mdg in the d@xmath0o system is a membrane contact degasser @xcite .",
    "it consists of bundles of hollow , porous , hydrophobic polypropylene fibers woven around a hollow polypropylene water distribution tube , all of which is contained in a polypropylene housing .",
    "the distribution tube is plugged at the center , and a baffle in the containment cartridge forces the water to flow to the outside of the cartridge and pass over the tightly packed fibers . as the water flows over the fibers , the dissolved gases pass through the fiber walls to their hollow center from which a vacuum pump draws the gases into a radon collection system similar to that in the h@xmath0o system .",
    "the water , on the other side of the baffle , goes back to the central water tube , exits the degasser , and is returned to the main d@xmath0o purification system .    the degassing efficiency of the d@xmath0omdg for radon has not been measured directly , but we can infer its efficiency from other experiments . by measuring the radon concentration of the water that enters and exits the d@xmath0oprocess degasser ,",
    "its efficiency was found to be @xmath33 at a flow rate of 195  liters / min .",
    "the process degasser contains two parallel sets of three membrane degassers in series where each degasser is of identical construction to the one in the mdg , so the inferred efficiency of a single degasser cell for radon is @xmath34 at 97.5  liters / min .",
    "this flow rate is much higher than the rate through the mdg which is customarily 21  liters / min . to extrapolate to lower flow rate",
    ", we can use an approximate membrane degasser model  @xcite which predicts that the efficiency @xmath35 varies with flow rate @xmath36 as @xmath37 where @xmath38 depends on degasser module geometry but is independent of gas species .",
    "the value of @xmath38 can be found for our degasser by applying this equation to measurements of the oxygen degassing efficiency of the process degasser at different flow rates .",
    "a probe  @xcite with ppb sensitivity in high resistivity liquids such as ultra - pure d@xmath0o was used , and the measured oxygen degassing efficiency of one cell of the process degasser was @xmath39 at 21  liters / min and @xmath40 at 97.5  liters / min . from these measurements",
    "we infer @xmath41 , and , using the measured radon efficiency at 97.5  liters / min , the predicted degassing efficiency of the mdg for radon is 62% at 21  liters / min .",
    "since several assumptions are involved in this model which may not be completely satisfied , such as independence of the degassing efficiency on the gas concentration , we assign a liberal systematic uncertainty to this estimate .",
    "the upper limit is set by noting that the efficiency for radon can be no more than that for oxygen at the same flow rate , i.e. , it must be less than 84% .",
    "a firm lower bound for the radon degassing efficiency at 21  liters / min is at 45% as that was the measured efficiency at 97.5  liters / min .",
    "we consider these extreme bounds to be effective two sigma uncertainties .",
    "our estimate for the radon degassing efficiency of the d@xmath0omdg is thus @xmath42 .",
    "the emanation and leak background of the mdg and radon collector were measured under static conditions @xcite as follows : the mdg and collector were sealed and their helium leak rate was measured to be less than @xmath43  cm@xmath9/s . then the system was evacuated and isolated for as long as 11  days , at the end of which the gas in each evacuated component was individually collected and counted .",
    "the most significant background was @xmath44  rn atoms / hr and came from the trap used to remove water vapor from the gas stream ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : rnboard ] ) .",
    "the only other appreciable background was from the degasser portion of the system which contributed @xmath45   atoms / hr . adding these two components gives a total assay system background of @xmath46   atoms / hr , which , for a typical assay time of 5  hours , gives a background of @xmath47   atoms on the collection trap at the end of the assay .",
    "this is much less than the @xmath2780  atoms that would be collected on the trap from the water if it were at the maximum allowable level .",
    "the concerns regarding possible changes in background with time that were expressed for the h@xmath0o system also pertain here . to account for such time - dependent changes in the background , we add , as for the h@xmath0osystem , a systematic uncertainty of @xmath30  atoms / hr , which makes the total assay system background",
    "@xmath48  atoms / hr .",
    "we describe here how the radon that is extracted from the water by the monitor degasser is collected , separated from other gases , and concentrated .",
    "the equipment used for this purpose is nearly the same in both the h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o systems and is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rnboard ] .",
    "it is based on apparatus developed to measure radon emanation for materials selection during the snodesign phase @xcite .    in overview ,",
    "the gases extracted from the water are first drawn by a vacuum pump through a cold trap which removes water vapor .",
    "the gas stream then flows through a liquid nitrogen cooled trap filled with bronze wool which stops radon , but allows n@xmath0 and o@xmath0 to pass through . at the end of the sampling period",
    "the captured radon is transferred to a concentrator trap and then to a specially - developed low - background lucas cell .",
    "these various components and their use in an assay will now be described .",
    "the gas stream first enters a water vapor trap  @xcite . in the h@xmath0o system , where the vapor load is about 10  cm@xmath9/min",
    ", the trap is an acrylic cylinder with a volume of 42  liters inside of which is a refrigeration coil .",
    "the coil is held at -60@xmath26cduring an extraction .",
    "the d@xmath0o system has a similar device but it is smaller as the vapor load is less by about a factor of 10 .    after passing through the water trap , the dry gas enters the primary radon trap which consists of a 10  mm diameter stainless steel tube stuffed with cleaned bronze wool and bent into a ` u ' shape .",
    "this tube , whose volume is @xmath250 cm@xmath9 , is immersed in liquid nitrogen during the extraction .",
    "n@xmath0 , o@xmath0 , and ar in the gas stream go through this trap , but radon , co@xmath0 and any residual water vapor adhere to the cold bronze wool .",
    "when a sufficient sampling time has elapsed , the valve at the inlet to the radon collector is closed .",
    "evacuation of the trap is continued for a few minutes to remove traces of nitrogen and oxygen .",
    "next , the valve to the vacuum pump is closed and the valve between the primary trap and the ( previously evacuated ) concentrator trap is opened .",
    "the concentrator trap is a coiled tube of 3  mm stainless steel tubing with 300  mm length that is also stuffed with bronze wool .",
    "the primary trap is heated with a heat gun and the concentrator trap is chilled with liquid nitrogen so the gas is cryopumped to the concentrator trap .",
    "the cryopumping continues for about 15  min during which time a lucas cell is attached to the system at an adjacent quick - connect port and evacuated .",
    "the concentrator trap is then isolated and heated and a valve between the lucas cell and the concentrator trap is opened . since the volume of the lucas cell is larger than that of the concentrator trap and connecting tubing , most of the radon transfers to the lucas cell by volume sharing .",

    "one end of the cylinder has a low - volume quick - connector @xcite through which radon gas is admitted and the other end is sealed with a flat sheet of acrylic . when @xmath1 particles from the decay of @xmath17rn or one of its @xmath1-emitting decay products strike the zns coating on the acrylic surface , light is emitted .",
    "the flat acrylic end of the cell is placed atop a photomultipler tube which detects this scintillation light .",
    "the cell diameter is 5  cm and the interior gas volume is 15.5  cm@xmath9 .",
    "these low background devices are described in detail in @xcite .",
    "new cells are leak checked with a he mass spectrometer and the cells in use are periodically checked by evacuating them underground , keeping them for several hours in this high radon environment , and bringing them to the surface for counting .",
    "a cell filled with underground air contains about 900  rn atoms , compared to @xmath2480 from d@xmath0o at the maximum allowable level .",
    "one cause of leakage is improper removal of the lucas cell from the assay system at its quick - connector at the end of an extraction .",
    "this problem appears to have occurred once in the assays of the d@xmath0o .",
    "leakage can also occur because of inadequate lubrication of , or dirt on , the connector o - rings .",
    "this problem was greatly reduced by instituting a regular program of disassembly , cleaning , and regreasing .",
    "this is essential because even small leaks can introduce a number of radon atoms comparable with the @xmath2150  atoms that are presently collected in a typical d@xmath0oassay .",
    "the section of the u chain that begins with is @xmath54{\\text{5.5 mev } \\alpha}$ ] @xmath55{\\text{6.0 mev } \\alpha}$ ] @xmath56{\\beta}$ ] @xmath57{\\beta}$ ] @xmath58{\\text{7.7 mev } \\alpha}$ ] , which has a 22-year half life . shortly after the decay of a atom two additional @xmath1 particles",
    "are emitted , from and .",
    "the effective efficiency of the lucas cell for decay is thus three times its efficiency for single-@xmath1 detection , provided counting begins a few hours or more after the cell is filled .",
    "the efficiency of the snolucas cells was measured by injecting air containing a known amount of radon into two cells at a commercial radon calibration company @xcite .",
    "the company measured the radon concentration of the air put into the cells to be @xmath59  bq / m@xmath9 , equivalent to about 12  000  rn atoms in each cell .",
    "the two cells were counted at snoabout one day after the radon injection . after accounting for decay between the time of injection and the start of counting , the cells were found to have single-@xmath1 detection efficiencies of 75% and 74% with a 0.6% statistical uncertainty and a 3.4% systematic uncertainty .    soon after the calibration of these two cells , nine lucas cells were taken underground , where the typical radon concentration is 100  bq / m@xmath9 , evacuated , and filled with ambient air .",
    "all cells were found to have similar efficiency but with a statistics dominated 12% uncertainty in each measurement . assuming all cells have the same efficiency , the standard deviation of efficiency from the combination of these measurements is @xmath607% . combining this with the known difference in efficiency from cell to cell due to their volume difference , which is @xmath493%",
    ", we conclude that the single-@xmath1 detection efficiency of cells that were not directly calibrated is @xmath61 .",
    "the 26% loss of @xmath1-particles is mainly due to the cell geometrical efficiency .",
    "when a lucas cell is new , its background from cosmic radiation and radioactivity in the zns is less than 3  counts per day , but the background gradually builds up with use .",
    "this increase in background is mainly due to the 5.3-mev @xmath1 from 138-d which comes from the gradual accumulation of 22-year . with each use of a cell",
    "its content builds up and the following decays produce an ever increasing cell background . each @xmath62  rn decays increase the cell background rate by roughly one count per day .",
    "after a cell has been used extensively , it will eventually have such a high background rate that it must be retired and replaced with a new one .",
    "the background of each lucas cell is periodically measured by evacuating it and counting in the standard manner .",
    "the background of the cells currently in use in d@xmath0oassays is about 10  counts / d and in the range of ( 1020 )  counts / d in h@xmath0oassays .",
    "these are known with a 10% statistical uncertainty .",
    "spurious signals in the photomultiplier dynode chain can be a source of noise unrelated to alpha decay within a lucas cell .",
    "the region of interest for @xmath1  decays is set to exclude such events , which mostly occur at low energy .",
    "nevertheless , there is some leakage into the region of interest . by counting without a lucas cell on the photomultiplier",
    ", this noise rate was measured to be less than 0.5 counts / d .",
    "the lower limit of the region of interest will cut out some true @xmath1 events .",
    "measurements with a lucas cell spiked with ( which we call a `` hot '' cell ) show that the fraction of events lost depends on the electronics in the counting station and is in the range of ( 05)% .",
    "this loss is accounted for in the counting efficiency uncertainty .",
    "cross - talk from adjacent counting stations is also a potential source of noise .",
    "this effect was measured by putting a `` hot '' cell on one station and measuring the number of counts that appeared in all other stations .",
    "even with @xmath63 counts on the `` hot '' station , the average number of counts on other stations did not exceed 0.5 counts .",
    "cross - talk is thus a negligible contributor to the systematic uncertainty .",
    "the long term photomultiplier gain drift was measured by comparing `` hot '' cell counting rates over a 3-year period . during this time the rate in the station",
    "used most often for d@xmath0o assays varied by @xmath64 and the rate in the stations used for h@xmath0o assays varied by no more than @xmath65 .",
    "in this section we derive the relationship between the cumulative number of detected counts and the concentration @xmath66 of radon in the water that enters the degasser .",
    "we assume that @xmath66 is constant .",
    "if we flow water at a constant rate of @xmath36 liters / min for a time interval of duration @xmath67 and extract with a degassing efficiency @xmath68 , then the number of radon atoms from the water that are present on the first trap in the collection system ( the primary radon trap ) at the end of extraction is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the radon trapping efficiency and @xmath71 is the decay constant .",
    "the term in parentheses is due to the decay of radon during the extraction time ; for short assay times this term is approximately @xmath72 . to obtain the total number of radon atoms present on the trap we must add to this the background of the radon assay system .",
    "defining @xmath73 as the rate of radon production by emanation , diffusion , and ingress in the degasser and the front section of the collection system , the number of radon atoms from these backgrounds on the trap at the end of extraction is @xmath74    these atoms are transferred to the lucas cell with efficiency @xmath75 . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : rncollect ] , the radon background of the section of the collection system used during this transfer is negligible .",
    "if the time delay between the end of extraction and the start of counting is @xmath76 , the number of radon atoms present in the lucas cell at the start of counting ( soc ) is @xmath77    the counting data consist of the superposition of two components :    * the decay of .",

    "after that time there are several intervals during which spikes of radon were unintentionally introduced .",

    "an improved interlock system has prevented similar faults during subsequent pump failures . in the first month of neutrino data - taking",
    ", the radon levels in the d@xmath0o were still elevated until the nitrogen `` cover gas '' protection system was improved to compensate for leaks in the seal of the d@xmath0o vapor space .",
    "after that time , there were two unintentional introductions of radon into the d@xmath0o , but their amplitude was not sufficient to appreciably interrupt neutrino data - taking .",
    "as is evident by examination of the assay plots , the average radon levels in both the h@xmath0o and d@xmath0o are well below the maximum allowable level .",
    "the interpretation of these assay results in terms of the net u - chain contamination and the way in which this contamination influences the neutrino detection rates reported in @xcite will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the method that snohas developed to determine the radon content of the water in the detector by direct assay has been described .",
    "this method is relatively simple to execute , is reliable , and has been shown to be capable of detecting a few tens of atoms of radon per tonne of water , equivalent , assuming equilibrium in the u - chain , to a concentration of a few times @xmath108  g  u / g  water .",
    "this sensitivity is adequate to show that the contribution to the neutral current background of the snodetector is substantially below the maximum allowable level , and thus it has been possible for snoto determine the total flux of solar neutrinos by measurement of the neutral current interaction rate .",
    "should the need arise , the sensitivity of this technique could be improved by an order of magnitude by reducing the background of the d@xmath0owater trap , by constructing new lucas cells , and by doubling the assay time .",
