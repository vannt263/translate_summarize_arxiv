    "this is not possible , as @xmath207 was chosen to be maximal .",

    "now @xmath85 contains at least three vertices , each of which is adjacent to @xmath171 in @xmath124 , and so , since @xmath136 is transitive on @xmath88 , it must be the case that @xmath136 fixes the vertex @xmath171 , and therefore fixes @xmath197 setwise . thus @xmath209 . if @xmath210 then @xmath211 , which can not happen since @xmath196 is primitive on @xmath94 . hence @xmath212 .",

    "conversely , suppose @xmath162 is an orbital digraph of @xmath81 acting on @xmath114 .",
    "we show the connectivity - one digraph @xmath218 is a canonical orbital digraph of @xmath0 .",

    "thus @xmath0 is transitive on the lobes of @xmath159 and acts arc - transitively on each lobe , so it must act arc - transitively on the whole digraph @xmath239 .",
    "it remains to show the lobes of @xmath239 have at most one end .",
    "this follows immediately from lemma  [ lemma : orbital_graphs_have_same_ends ] , since both @xmath79 and @xmath240 are orbital digraphs of @xmath81 acting on @xmath114 , they must have the same ends .",
    "hence , @xmath160 is a connectivity - one orbital digraph of @xmath0 in which each lobe has at most one end , and is therefore a canonical orbital digraph of the group @xmath0 .",
    "thus , for any primitive group @xmath0 possessing a canonical orbital digraph @xmath5 , when speaking of the permutation - ends of @xmath0 as being the ends of @xmath5 , it makes sense to refer to the _ lobe - ends _ and _ tree - ends of @xmath0 _ as being , respectively , the lobe - ends and tree - ends of its canonical orbital digraph . this can be extended to include any group @xmath0 with just one permutation - end @xmath115 , by defining the _ lobe - end of @xmath0 _ to be the end @xmath115 . + that a whole class of infinite primitive permutation groups possessing no infinite subdegree should each have an orbital digraph whose structure is tree - like is a property that will be explored and exploited in a future paper by the author . in particular , this result will be fundamental in the examination of the possible rates of subdegree growth of infinite primitive permutation groups .",
    "+ the concluding section of this paper is conceived as a simple illustration of just one way in which the existence of the canonical orbital digraph may be used to easily obtain a deep understanding of the structure of infinite primitive groups possessing no infinite subdegree , through the application of bass and serre s theory on trees .",
